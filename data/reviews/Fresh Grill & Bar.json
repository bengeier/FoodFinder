{"text":"Got a Groupon deal for two Yard stick drinks.  It was good, but didn't do ANYTHING to me. Didnt even feel a buzz. You gotta buy extra shots if you want it to be worth something.  Haven't tried the food, so this review is just based on the drinks. The drinks were tasty though. They say that Moonshine is the strongest of the bunch...ehhh."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl, which said on the menu, \"add grilled veggies.\"  I took this to mean it came with grilled veggies, but apparently it meant \"you can add grilled veggies if you want to.\"  When I got the bowl with no veggies, I asked for them to be added.  Sometime later, I was brought a cup of \"grilled veggies\" (mostly squash, which doesn't really go with chicken teriyaki) that were COLD.  Yuck.  The chicken was not good either.  Worst meal I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  The chips were an added bonus.  We ended up getting the combo meal that included fries and drink... not quite sure why if the sandwiches already come with chips??  The smoothies and sandwiches delicious!  Used a restaurant.com certificate which made finding this hidden gem worth it!"}
{"text":"OK!  Here's another update and hopefully my last.  (For the vegetarians)  I spoke with the owner about the two key ingredients of the Southwest Wrap: the flavorful rice and the black beans.  Both are ok for vegetarians.  No chicken stock or bouillon or shortening or anything like that.  They are good to go.    Hooray!"}
{"text":"My group stopped here twice while in Vegas to use the Groupons we bought for their yard long drinks. These drinks are obviously all over Vegas but we were pretty impressed by the ones we got here.   The drinks were pretty strong, tasted great, and were great for staying cool. The only problem is that some of the flavors get too sour or sweet before you can finish the entire drink. Try the moonshine flavor, it was the best"}
{"text":"Fresh is located at the way back of the Miracle Mile Shops, and honestly, away from the action. If you spent the day in the mall than the location would be convenient, but we came here from off of the strip, and it felt far away. The walk was not too bad, but the atmosphere is so quiet in a place where action is desirable. There was a Fat Tuesdays daiquiri bar nearby, so maybe that would provide more of a Vegas atmosphere in the evening.   To order, the menu has a variety of sandwiches with chips, or, interesting teriyaki bowls. The chicken teriyaki bowl with grilled vegetables was filling and tasted good. However, it is a long wait for the food, a very long wait.   Overall, if you're looking for an inexpensive, healthy meal, this is a good place on the strip. But, it is faraway and quiet."}
{"text":"Best place in all Nevada for Strawberry daiquiris, according to a world expert in daiquiris who was in my company. Their other drinks such as moonshine and Miami Vice are also excellent. Food-wise I only had their unique chips which are indeed very tasty. Service is very friendly and helpful too. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant twice during my trip to Vegas. I must say, their prices are a bit steep for the food they serve, but they are relatively healthy compared to the other places on the strip.  Don't forget to check in on yelp to get a discount! I got tried their buffalo chicken wrap and their caesar salad.  Both were what you would expect BUT do get their cilantro lime sauce in their sauces section! It is delicious with their food, which is why they get four stars instead of three. Such a fan of this sauce, I wanted to try and replicate it at home!"}
{"text":"Used a restaurant.com certificate at this establishment.  Was a good value for the money ($25 off purchases of $50 or more).  Found the food to be good, but location was a little small.  Known better for their slush/alcohol drinks.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"can't really comment on the food as we didn't get any, but this review is for the service and the slush drinks they have.   We bought the groupon now deal where you get the yard drink for $12 instead of the usual $17.  the only reason i wouldn't give it a 5 star is that in the picture they show the hard which looks like the similar ones at fat tuesday etc, but when you use the groupon, you get a giant plastic beer bottle cup instead.  not that i mind as i think it is a little cooler, but it is slightly smaller so you get slightly less drink than the groupon advertises.  other than that, nothing but good things to say about the lady who helped us, and how the drinks tasted.  she let our whole group try each of the flavors before we picked what we wanted, and did a good job describing what was in each drink.  i ended up getting the moonshine as i am about getting the strongest drink offered at least once.  my friends got a mix of the other drinks and we were all happy.  i will say though, i didn't really notice myself getting anything more than slightly buzzed off the drink (its about 40 ounces), but i used the cup to make a big cherry pepsi (pepsi with cherry skky vodka) when we got back to the room which seemed to get me drunk, and it was a good container to carry the drink around with when we went out.  i would be back to get the cup filled next time i am back, and try some of the food as it smelled really good and what people were eating, looked really good"}
{"text":"mmmm strawberry daiquiri!! to die for... my favorite place to go to over Fat Tuesday! BOMB!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food we had on our trip to Vegas.. staff Is very nice and prices are reasonably cheap for the amount of food you get.. I would recommend this place to anyone who lives in vegas or who is just visiting.. excellent food..."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Basic mall food.  Strawberry daiquiri was good, flavor - wise, but didn't taste like it had much alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Groupon for two yard drinks.  Tried the Moonshine and the Happy Ending, both good and got a nice buzz.  Definitely nice to sip on a hot day while walking down the Strip.  Quick and friendly too.  You can add a little battery operated flashing Vegas sign to your cup for only $3.  Super fun :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the yard size Pina Colada and Strawberry Daiquiri.  Both of them were great!  The employee was very helpful and patient.     We are going back to Las Vegas soon and will be stopping by here again.  This time we'll stop by during dinner time because the food looked and smelled great.  I also can't wait to try some of the other drink flavors."}
{"text":"My ex-gf worked there for 9 years. And after all that time the owner, Kenny, never offered insurance, paid time off, maternal leave. This is to a full time employee. He employed illegal workers and benefitted from those workers because they had no rights. Paid them under the table and expected complete and utter tolerance of his bullshit. So this Kenny guy  comes in on Tuesday, 1/5/16, to tell everyone working there they won't have jobs on Thursday. Class act. Then this schmuck has the nerve to tell his workers not to tell anyone that they are closing. He knew this long before he told his employees, I'm not sure if its illegal to not provide your workers with due notice. But if it is illegal I'd sure love to see this ass burn over it. Hopefully he never runs a business again."}
{"text":"Great food and stiff drinks! We went there around 1AM for a late night snack.   I didn't expect this place to serve hard liquor, but the bartender was very helpful and seemed enthusiastic about mixing one for me. I ended up getting a lemon drop double shot. It tasted great, I'm not a drink person and it didn't taste like alcohol at all. The cost was excellent- $6 for the double lemon drop!   By the way, they also sell different types of novelty drink cups like the yard long mugs and the guitar shaped containers ($35- yikes).  We ordered the chicken fingers, which came with a side of homemade potato chips. They were delicious! We noticed there was a small side bar of different types of sauces. The only con was that it took a little bit too long to get our food.  I'd definitely come back to this restaurant if we stay at Planet Hollywood again... but not worth a trip out of your way."}
{"text":"While I was in Vegas for a long weekend, I decided to try the Tacone Flavor Grill. I had read the Yelp reviews and the place averaged 4 stars. I also found a certificate for this eatery on Restaurant.com. We were excited to try the place!  First of all, we weren't expecting a fast food place in a Mall. I'm not sure how I missed this when reading the Yelp reviews. Mind you, I don't mind eating in fast food places or in the Mall, if the food is decent.  My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla and french fries and I ordered a burrito with chicken. Both of us found it difficult to finish what we ordered. The french fries had a distinct odor of curry and the rice in my burrito tasted like it had saffron in it. This was like no Mexican food we ever tasted!  The food was inexpensive and with the Restaurant.com certificate, it was pretty cheap. I guess in this situation, we got what we paid for. :-(  Next time we go to Vegas, I won't be going back to the Tacone Flavor Grill."}
{"text":"Just tried to order their grilled steak salad and my bf wanted a french fries on the side which was a wrong combination to begin with. Well, anyways, I was not really impressed at all. The grilled steak tasted good but their salad wasn't really fresh and no matter what sauces I put, still not really great...Mcdo salad is way better I guess."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon here for two yard sized drinks. No problems redeeming the deal, but we were charged for tax.  The SERVICE was actually VERY GOOD - the cashier we had was extremely friendly and offered us the opportunity to try all the samples before deciding on what flavor we wanted.   The DRINKS, however, were NOT VERY GOOD; they were not strong at all, and after drinking it for a while it either got too sweet (strawberry) or too sour (happy ending), to the point where we felt sick drinking it.  I would not be back again, even with another deal."}
{"text":"I have eaten at another Tacone Flavor Grill in town and, mostly due to the discount coupon I had, enjoyed the meal.  However, paying full price for what you get, I didn't enjoy it THAT much, which was the case tonight.  Price is about the only thing that keeps this place from getting 5 stars.  My girlfriend and I were attended a show at the Krave Nightclub called Fashionistas.  Since there is no food served there we had to venture into the Miracle Mile Shops.  There are many places to eat but we chose Tacone Flavor Grill because of my recommendation.  The choices are plentiful from wraps to sandwiches, soups and salads.  Many have pointed out the sauce bar where you can choose from different flavorful sauces to compliment your meal.  She ordered a grilled chicken wrap, I believe, while I went fairly simple with an Angus Cheeseburger.  Not just a cheeseburger but a sandwich burger that was absolutely juicy and melted in my mouth.  I cannot speak for anyone but myself, but I do believe both of us enjoyed the food.  The price of two sandwiches was around $20.00.  This is what I meant by price knocking off a point.  I could find 20 other restaurants on here that don't charge that much that are just as good.  However, adding a $10 off $20 purchase coupon to the mix and this place cannot be missed.  Check www.restaurant.com for discounts."}
{"text":"We found this place in the Miracle Mile mall during our stay. After paying way too much in food (and not great food either) we just wanted a place that was fast and decent. They delivered and the staff was nice. This is a serve-yourself type of place, but they were still nice. The salad was really good and loved the sweet potato fries!   Loved that they had Dr. Pepper. Seriously, what does Vegas have against Dr. Pepper????"}
{"text":"Stayed @ PH Towers and this was our first stop after checking in. Really enjoyed Fresh! The boyfriend had the Santa Fe salad and I had the same as a wrap and it hit the spot! Those homemade potato chips:yeah buddy! They were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was good enough to warrant two trips during my short trip to Vegas.  For my first visit to Fresh Grill, I had the buffalo chicken wrap, which may have not been the best idea for a hot day in Vegas. I normally find buffalo sauce to be not spicy enough for me, but the sauce they used here definitely was. I had to keep adding extra ranch dressing to cool my burning mouth.  On my second visit, my friend and I shared the honey mustard chicken wrap, which my tongue thanked me for.   I love all the different sauces and dippers they provide here. My friends and I tried almost all of them: who knew that Italian dressing tasted so good with seasoned fries?  The wraps are huge: we all took home half of our meals and ate it for dinner later; the second time, we were smart enough to share our orders. The homemade chips are pretty good, but they are inconsistent with how much each order gets. My friends sometimes only got a few pieces plus crumbs, while my serving had loads of chips."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Chicken teriyaki bowl...  The chicken: white, fully cooked, doesn't taste rancid  The rice: also white  The veggies: death by grill  The flavor: meh"}
{"text":"Looking for vegan food on the Strip? You don't have too many choices, my friend...but here's one option that will keep you from starving.  They offer a grilled veggie salad, a grilled veggie sandwich, and a grilled veggie wrap. I ordered the grilled veg. salad and had them leave off the mozzarella. What was left was: spinach, carrots, grilled zucchini, grilled Italian squash, tomatoes, and sesame seeds. I added the cilantro lime dressing, which has no dairy. It was pretty good and filling, with a nice zing to the dressing. I can't vouch for the vegan-ness of the bread used in the sandwich or the tortilla used in the wrap, but those might be options as well.  The Fresh Grill & Bar is located about half of the way around the giant circle of the mall if you start at Planet Hollywood. The mall's fun to walk around in...it's like Disneyland Imagineers designed a mall, with faux blue sky and clouds and even a fake rainstorm including thunder and lightning."}
{"text":"Food was decent. A little pricey for the amount of food but still very good. They have frozen drinks here and it's a good deal compared to other places on the strip with food. My steak and cheese sandwich was good, sweet potato fries were food also. Place was clean and you get an awesome deal for checking in here."}
{"text":"Good price - great value.  Yummy filet mignon wrap.  I didn't care for their salsa though.  Great quesadillas.  Convenient b/c I stayed at the PH."}
{"text":"Stopped by Wednesday of last week. We got a yard sized margarita with 3 extra shots of tequila. Nice!!! It sure got me buzzed :) Service was good. We were given a couple samples. I just wish there were more Fresh Grills throughout the Strip to get refills more conveniently."}
{"text":"Ahh finally, a place in Vegas where they serve relative cheap and healthy food, in the convenience of a mall with Plant Hollywood.  After a night (and very early morning) full of chugging excessive liquid toxins served in a glass with a straw, the last thing your stomach needs is something greasy and indigestible. I always come to Fresh Grill & Bar when I'm in need of a light and refreshing lunch to let my body recover, and the Santa Fe salad is always my go-to meal. For less than $10, you get: romaine lettuce, corn, tortilla strips, chicken, and avocado - almost enough for two meals, what's not to love?   Don't forget to check out the dressing bar- i recommend the cilantro lime or cilantro ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"While I can't say anything of the food, the moonshine is amazing and a good deal. Fruit juice based blended drinks here that aren't full of syrupy sugar - so no sick feeling after drinking 'em!  The moonshine is made with Everclear but you wouldn't know from tasting it. 4 shots come in the 36oz sized drinks (pre-blended), but the real deal here is that extra shots in your drink are only $1.25 a piece! Tell me somewhere else on the strip you can get a refill with a total of 8 shots for $15.   To boot, the servers here were very nice and helpful! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be heading here first thing! I think in the 5 days we were in Vegas, my boyfriend and I had about 10 of these drinks!"}
{"text":"We used a Groupon and there was no Groupon shame! Yay! That's always nice. However, we did feel a little slighted because the Groupon says it's for a yard, we received a smaller drink. It was definitely still a deal though. Got a moonshine (everclear! Shockingly good!) mixed with piña colada and a piña colada mixed with happy ending (an Arnold Palmer with sweet tea vodka). The piña colada is made with coconut milk, it's really creamy. I'm lactose intolerant, so this is a big plus for me. We got the extra shots in both so we could leave a tip, but who can resist dollar shots? Really good drinks, free samples so you can see what you like, and friendly service. The food looked great, we'll have to stop in on our next trip!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this weekend for the Rock and Roll Half Marathon.  I more hungry then tired after the marathon, so I went to Planet Hollywood to eat at Tacone.  I've heard good things about this place but haven't had the opportunity to try it until now.  Let's say this... I ATE A LOT and enjoyed every bite.  I had a Spa Salad with a side of Blackbeans/Jack cheese and Sweet Potato Fries.  The sauces at the sauce bar were amazing, and the people there were really nice.  It was good food for a good price.  Next time I'll try their drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for a Yard (Yes from that Groupon Deal)  First of all the staff here is very FRIENDLY! I was very pleased.  I asked for a Margarita, since they had run out and they offered to make it by hand. WOW! very good.  Honestly if you are in Vegas come here for your yards instead of FAT TUESDAY  The prices are reasonably cheap, REFILLS are Cheaper than anywhere on the strip (I Checked) and the service here is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was excellent and very engaging.  Their suggestions were spot on and I definitely recommend the Captain Crunch Frosted Flake Chicken.  How it got on the menu is still a mystery to me but I am glad it did!  Also be sure to check for a yelp coupon with your check in."}
{"text":"We always make our way here for the frozen drink called \"Moonshine\".  It's a Bahama Mamma mix with Everclear. We have also occasionally got fries or a quick sandwich. Today with our Yelp check in we got a coupon for their fresh cut fries. They were delicious and hot! The drinks are pricey, but not by Vegas standards. We keep coming back so I guess that says something!"}
{"text":"I have dreams about these homemade potato chips, no lie.   Went here after I was starvation central at the Yelp event. The staff was very courteous after I mentioned my dietary restrictions, and whipped up a veggie burrito for me with a side of the potato chips. SO yummy! Tons of veggies, rice with balsamic vinaigrette. The dip bar is really awesome and everything was just like the name - fresh. You get a really big portion for the price; I'm amazed since it is inside a casino.   Great food, great prices, fantastic customer service. Whenever I'm in Planet Hollywood I will try and make sure to stop for a bite!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Literally walking out after ordering a moonshine and the owner saw our big group and offered us a free basket of potato chips.   We love this place and come here every time we visit.   Foods always good drinks are fantastic.  Get the extra everclear  shots.   So good!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst fast food place. First of all, this is not a restaurant. It's a panda express type of place and the cashier was asking for the tip. So I refused it and she was upset about it and didn't submit my order. We were waiting for our food for 15 min and found out she didn't submit our order. The owner didn't care about it and pretending nothing happened. The food was dry and salty too.  We wanted to grab a quick snack and it was the worst experience ever"}
{"text":"came here mainly because of restaurant.com and yelp.    It's okay.  I can't see how its a 4 star but probably a difference of opinion.  Had the honey mustard chicken warp.  If you like guac, you'll love it.  It was lacking chicken though.  It was more of a guac with some chicken warp.  Came out to about $8/person after tax/tip/rest.com cert for a combo each."}
{"text":"Bought the groupon for the two yard sized drinks for $21.    We did it for the \"experience\" since we have never done it before.  Was it worth the $10 experience...yes.    We did NOT finish our drinks....let's put it this way: Yard sized sugary drinks in 100+ degree heat that bakes you from the inside out like a convection oven....NOT A GOOD COMBO.  LOL   We literally drank 1/3 of the drink and threw it out...and are keeping the cups to remind us of our rediculousness.   The strawberry daq was good...a regular sized drink would have truly given the same feeling and effect of letting your hair down on vacation."}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty option when you're sick of spending too much in Vegas!  The location is convenient and free alcohol samples are definitely appreciated.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After seeing the line wrap around Earl of Sandwich, my friends and I decided to come here for lunch. Hm... it wasn't bad. There was a decent selection of wraps, salad, sides and so forth.   We ordered the Thai Chicken and Steak Baja wrap, and both came with a side of potato chips. Not bad. It wasn't anything over the top, but it worked. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=f2Uj2qhVtH3kq5umPWcpqw)  There was almost no line, however, the wait for our food took a while. Hm, I'm not really sure why... but that's how it worked out.   There's a condiments bar in the middle of the restaurant, as well as a bar to the right. I tried the cilantro and steak sauce. Not bad.   Not one of my first choices to eat, but it worked out this day."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon deal - $22 for two yard drinks. Added the extra shot to both of them which they said was an extra $1 each, but somehow the total came out over $3 for the two. Definitely worth it with the Groupon, and now that I have the yards I can come back for a $13 refill!!!"}
{"text":"Since I wrote about Tacone in Tustin, CA. It would not be fair not to write about Tacone in Vegas,especially the reason I visited the one in Tustin was because of the delicious wraps I had in Vegas. I had a coupon printed out from some Vegas tourism website, so my whole family went to Tacone for lunch. We did not have any high expectations since it is a fast food eatery, and it is inside Aladdin, we just wanted a quick bite before taking my kids to BuildaBear. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!  There was a free sauce bar, from the popular honey mustard, bbq, to exotic creamy cilantro sauce and balsamic flavored dip, the kids were just having an awesome time trying all of them! The wraps were huge, I could not finish and had mine doggy bagged. I had the Thai cone, the peanut sauce with the cucumber salad tucked inside the wrap with soft steaming jasmine rice was superb! Hubby's Mambo wrap's filet mignon was juicy and tender. Kids loved their Campfire chicken wraps with sweet bbq sauce. The price is a bit expensive, hence the four stars. I think it was about $8.95/wrap. But it is something different and refreshing."}
{"text":"The steak and peppers wrap was very succulent, I would prefer adding chipotle sauce or something spicy to go with it. The fries was to die for but portion was kind of small..."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  The portions are huge and the food is amazing.  Especially the dipping sauces.  They had several different kinds that went very well with our sweet potato fries.  I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap - delicious, and my husband got a cheeseburger that he was quite impressed with.  I wish there were some in my area because I really like this place - according to their website, they're putting one in Sacramento, and I'll definitely be visiting it when it opens.   We didn't try the drinks here, but they looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Out of all of the eateries here Tacone is one of my faves to come to. They have great beef sandwiches and tasty (yet albeit wet) quesadillas.   I also like the selection of sauces.   It's just a good place to eat at if you're in the Miracle Mile.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THE YARD SLUSHY  Don't do it.  If that didn't help let me explain:  1. Buy Groupon deal for the Yard Slushy at Fresh Grill & Bar, 2 for $22  2. We get our drinks and it's absolutely disgusting. I think it's somewhere between 30-40 oz for the yard and it's 95% sugar water and 5% liquor that doesn't/didn't mix well.  3. Take two sips and throw it away. Immediate buyer's regret.  4. Went to Fat Tuesday and got the Spiked Lemonade and enjoyed the rest of my day.  Honestly you can dress it up and put make up on it but it's not going to walk the runway.   My wife and I are not seasoned drinkers or taste experts and we both unanimously agreed to throw out the yard after two sips.   Also, we were not offered samples. If we were and did take them, do you think I would of went and thrown away my money?"}
{"text":"Located within the miracle mile shops, decided to get some lunch here.  This review will be strictly for their food since I did not get any of their drinks like other reviewers have. I got the turkey wraps and their homemade chips, which did come out pretty quickly and was solid food. Nothing really special though and nothing really stood out about this place. They do have a nice sauce bar with many different \"homemade\" (I think) sauces that were great to try with the wrap.   Overall though, I definitely think you're better off going to earl of sandwich instead if you can do the walk."}
{"text":"So so good! Favorite place to eat on the strip and not too pricy either. All wraps are good and make sure to try the sauce bar.. The cilantro lime is my favorite and goes well on everything.  And for drinks, try the moonshine!"}
{"text":"This review is for their forzen alcoholic beverages:  They sucked, they supposedly had 4 shots of booze in them, but the pina colada flavor was so mikly-mc-nasty, I drank about 1/4 of my large, \"beer glass\" drink and threw it away.   By the way, I got the Groupon and I felt I wasted my money. Their yard-size is not a yard, it's like a \"yay-high\" size. Lame"}
{"text":"I'd like to think of this place as a high-end sandwich place... great food and wraps, and their sauces at the flavor bar are awesome!  I have yet to try their margaritas, but the food is great. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible food, avoid at all cost! Steak sandwich was nothing but fat, after the lady at the counter told us it wasn't..."}
{"text":"This is a very good place for a quick bite! It certainly lives up to its name- everything tasted extremely fresh and tasty. I got the honey mustard chicken wrap and sweet potato fries ($8.99) . The wrap was a pretty sizable portion, with lots of grilled chicken, avocado, and lettuce. The fries were sizzling hot, right out of the fryer.  Apparently they have quite an extensive drink menu as well, but I didn't get an opportunity to sample any of those.   The sauce bar was a really nice treat as well. The restaurant was clean and everyone was pleasant. If I'm back at PH and hungry, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food here but the slushy drink they call 'Moonshine' we come back for year after year... There are slushy drinks sold all over Vegas but this Moonshine is our favorite...it is made with a tropical fruit mixer and pretty high octane Everclear... Goes down easy and packs a Vegas punch ... Perfect for sipping as you shop in The Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"We get their yard drinks every time we go to vegas because they have a groupon for $25 for two yard drinks. I usually get the moonshine with their promo shots. The drinks are way stronger than fat tuesday and the customer service is always great. I have also eaten here a few times and I really love their salads. I will continue to come here even if they don't have the groupon anymore because it's more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Not inside planet holllywood, in the mall. Cilantro lime sauce is pretty tasty. Recommended for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian selections! The owner/manager is there to great you and make you feel like a regular. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a healthy meal in the land of gluttony!"}
{"text":"Just OK. Food was anything to rave about. I've been to other Tacones and the food has always been really good. Very disappointed. I do think this location focuses more on the alcoholic beverages than the food."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Got nachos and a wrap. Employees are great. Wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"I mostly come here for their slushie drinks other than that their food is alright its average tasting nothing over the top. I just think some of the prices are not too reasonable compare to others due to the lack of flavor in some things in my opinion. I like their seasoned potato chips though. So yeah I'll stick to the drinks instead. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch when we first arrived at the towers on Friday.  I had a double burger and wasnt really impressed with it.  The meat was stiff as a board/very dry when I asked for medium.  The sides were nothing to write home about either, I requested grilled vegetables and got vegetables in a liquid mesh soup, it was disgusting!   Don't waste your time going to Fresh Grill.  Just go to the cafe in the main building at Planet Hollywood.  The service is million times better, waitresses are really cute/friendly/down to earth, the quality of the food is by far better and the food is more affordable."}
{"text":"We stopped here, on our way thru Planet Hollywood.  The Bartender, Britney was very friendly and helped create a few unique shots, with the limited selection of liquor she had.  The shots were good, even if they were a bit strong.  Prices are higher here, than at other places within Planet Hollywood, but it is conveniently located and good for a quick stop."}
{"text":"Didn't know how to use the yelp coupon offer. Chips were old and cold. \"A\" team is not working tonight. Ill give it another try some other time."}
{"text":"Used the Groupon ... ordered Happy Ending and got a Peach smoothie for my daughter. I don't get the negative reviews ... cashier did  a great customer service  explaining what you can get out of this deal. Worth it!"}
{"text":"I have to confess that I got a great deal on a restaurant.com that pushed me into this mall restaurant and bar.  The lure were the gigantic slushy cocktails combined with nachos!  The nachos were your typical fair but the slushy drinks were the hit!  We had to hit $50 to get the $25 off so extra shots were required in the \"Moonshine\" drinks we imbibed.  They were definitely amped up after the extra shots.   The location is a little inconvenient...it is in the middle of the mall by Planet Hollywood but the drinks make up for the walk.  The other food they served looked decent but stick with the big boozy slushies and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Before hitting the road back to LA, my friend and I tried to find something quick to eat. After stopping at Garretts popcorn, we found this place on the way out of the mall. It was convenient, so we ordered something simple. My friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. I ordered grilled veggies and rice with teriyaki sauce. Neither of us finished our food! Although I saw multiple veggies on the menu in several items, my bowl only had zucchini, squash, and a couple of bell peppers. The rice was very thin and dry. It was exactly like the rice in frozen meals that you cook in the microwave. I couldn't understand why there was no carrots and broccoli included in a teriyaki bowl, at least! The sauce was way too sweet and did nothing to enhance the flavor. I've eaten a better, fresher tasting veggie teriyaki bowl with real rice from Jack in the Box for much less money!! As much as I tried forcing myself to finish this bowl before our 4 1/2 hours drive, I couldn't. What a waste of money and time!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a satisfying my fresh wrap cravings! And any place that has sweet potato fries on the menu gets a chance with me.  We were staying at the PH  Towers, so Fresh Grill was right around the corner in the Miracle Mile Shopping Mall.  It's easy to pass by if your not looking for it.  They have a large menu with lots of items that sound good. There are two lines: one for food with alcohol and one if you are not needing bar service. Btw- I saw a sign that said they would refill ANY souvenir cup for a discounted price.  Our food: I got the honey mustard chicken wrap and hubby got the turkey ranch wrap. Both very good!"}
{"text":"We went here because of a Groupon Special for 42% off the yard drinks,  I got a  piña colada and my husband got the moonshine. The drinks were good and it was a good value."}
{"text":"Great service.  My boyfriend and I bought a Groupon Now deal for a one yard drink at Fresh Grill and Bar for $12. We decided to get the drink a couple hours before seeing Barry Manilow at Paris next door, so we could be slightly buzzed. When we got to Fresh Grill, we went to look at the drink selections before getting in line. I remember seeing Pina Colada, Happy Ending, Moonshine, and one other drink (probably a Daiquiri). We were debating between Moonshine and Happy ending when one of the ladies just handed us a sample of each of them. It took me by surprise that she did that because we didn't even ask for a sample, let alone of Moonshine and Happy Ending. I'd say it's pretty genuine customer service when the employees are that aware of what's going on around them and do things to please customers without having to be asked.   I personally liked the Happy Ending, but my boyfriend liked Moonshine, so we compromised and got a mix of both with a double shot of vodka added into the mix. Our total ended up being a little over $15 for a yard drink with a double shot in a pretty snazzy giant beer bottle. We didn't even notice they had two options for a yard sized drink. The other option was a giant cup, but we opted for the beer bottle because it had a lid with a coin slot that you can use when you're all done getting crunk. It also has a handle, so you don't have to worry about melting the icy drink with your hands. The drink was pretty tasty; we ended up finishing the whole yard within an hour or so and got a nice buzz going for the show.  To be honest, I always find these drinks to be pretty pricey, but with the Groupon, it's an awesome deal. I think you save about 29% or something, which is savings you could use on extra shots! I've seen the deal on Groupon Now Las Vegas for the past month, so you might still be able to get it."}
{"text":"Oh sweet Tacone Grill, you made my day. Just as I was about to faint from exhaustion, you rescued me with your caprese style sandwich--tomatoes, pesto, olive tapenade, and that slinky mozarella. I sank my teeth into your cheesy goodness and was not disappointed. I meant to save half for my shopping companion, but just kept going. And your homemade chips....so...delicious...so good...You're a 6 on this five star scale, and I hope that you will one day make yourself available to the SF Bay Area..."}
{"text":"Came here using a Groupon for 2 yards. I had the Moonshine and it was soooo good with another shot of Everclear. I think I'll come back to this spot instead of Fat Tuesdays for my yards."}
{"text":"The food is ok, not mind blowing. It's basically just snack food not real meals. I'd call it a classier Mc Donald's. I purchased a \"refillable souvenir cup\" but I had to pay $1.00 each time I refilled it. Can you say false advertisement."}
{"text":"The food is good and the location is convenient. I happened to have a seat that's pretty chilly because it is close to the parking garage's door. Take more time to find a better spot if you decided to eat there."}
{"text":"I bought a deal on Groupon Now! And it expired so I wasn't sure if I could use it.  $13 for a yard.  Super cheap.  I asked if it was possible for me to still use it.  The older lady who worked there was very helpful and got approval from her manager.  We tried a sample of their drinks.  My favorites were moonshine and happy ending.  Happy ending was like a lemon sweet tea vodka.  Not sure what moonshine was, but it was good.  I got the beer bottle, 40 ozs, and filled it with a happy moon, half and half of happy ending and moonshine.  All I paid for was the tax, 71 cents.  Definitely the best!!!! and the best service :)"}
{"text":"I like this place.  Not fancy but good. Great value.  Sauce bar is good.  Lime cilantro is my favorite.  I ear hear when I am in the mall"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh & drinks were great.  Ordered strawberry daiquiri the customer service was very helpful.  We asked them to take our picture with our drinks & they obliged.  It is located in a strip mall but, great vibe.. Would def be back.."}
{"text":"I'm here at 12:30am and it states that they are closed at 1am. But when I show up at 12:30am, they said that they are closed since midnight. Whether the employees ate lying to me or they need to fix the time, either way it's was a waste of time."}
{"text":"Went here for their specialty frozen beverages...we both got the \"Happy Ending\" which consists of frozen lemonade and sweet tea vodka. It was delicious but it gave me instant heartburn and I was unable to even get through half of it. Kinda of a waste of money, wish I had gone with a different flavor."}
{"text":"I only come here for crown and diet coke to go. I always ask if they can make it extra strong and they do, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Got the steak wrap, black beans and soda. There was a long line to get cheap alcohol refills of drinks, but worked through the line pretty quickly.   Pros: good food and little salsa bar. Cons: service could have been much better, but it's mall food with teenagers."}
{"text":"My wife and I missed our dinner reservations at a nearby restaurant in the Miracle Mile shops by an hour or so and did not want to chance missing a show we were going to later so we stopped at Fresh Grill & Bar for a quick bite. The fact I had a gift certificate from restaurant.com handy made the decision easy.  We went through the food only checkout and there was no line. I ordered a turkey wrap combo with cole slaw and soft drink and my wife ordered the Teriyaki chicken wrap combo with sweet potato fries and a soft drink. The girl that took our order gladly accepted the gift cert. and took 10 dollars off bringing our total to a cool 12 dollars. Plus a 5 dollar tip for bringing our food to the table about 10 minutes later. 17 bucks for a quick filling fresh meal? A great deal in Vegas if you ask me.  My wife loved her wrap. It was fresh. Big chunks of chicken. First time she ever had a wrap with rice in it. Sweet potato fries were hot and fresh as well.  My wrap was loaded with fresh turkey, and guacamole! Good stuff. The slaw was good too, with big shreds of fresh cabbage. What really added to the meal were the homemade potato chips. You don't get that kind of stuff from any old food court joint.  Free refills on the soft drinks was nice. When every other place is looking to squeeze the most money out of their customers for every little thing, Fresh Grill came through with a good deal on a fresh meal."}
{"text":"I never dare to miss this spot every time i'm in Vegas! Bomb food, good customer service. If you get hungry while shopping at the miracle mall I recommend you stop by!  P.s ko th Turkey wrap is really good !"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in to this place super hungry and grumpy. I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap, which was pretty good. I usually don't do wraps but this really hit the spot. They have a salsa bar which my friend fell in love with lime cilantro salsa!! They also have fraps which can be dirty or virgin ;). My friend wasn't a big fan of their homemade potatoes chips and their fries were typical, nothing special. i give this place 3 stars due to excellent customer service, and awesome wraps and sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the \"MOONSHINE\" beverage with 4 shots. It was pretty strong but it was pretty tasty. Had me buzzing a little while walking along the strip. Saved the tall cup as a souvenir (: definitely a MUST try !"}
{"text":"The food looked better than it tasted, and the service sucked. Overall, I was disappointed. Try something else."}
{"text":"While I can't speak on behalf of the food, I can say that those giant daiquiri drinks you see people lugging around are probably the cheapest here. Based on my cursory assessment at least.   They don't offer the variety you'll find at other daiquiri bars (only four flavors), but their prices are a good $2-$4 less. And in such an expensive city, this certainly counts for something. To lessen the girliness of your daiquiri, you can add extra shots at $1.25 each as well. Make it a \"Man Daiquiri\" as my friend calls it.   I opted for a Strawberry + Pina Colada one in the smallest size (11 oz I think) and it was only around $11. It was on the lighter side in terms of alcohol content though, so if your tolerance is high and you want a buzz, I'd suggest adding in extra shots. Other than that, it was a delicious way to keep myself occupied while we wandered around the Miracle Miles Shops at PH.   They offer free samples too! FOUR STARS."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick bite, I stopped here for dinner before a show. You just order at the counter and they will call your name - sorta like a casual fast food place but everything was just right. The chicken wings and fries were really good. I should have sampled some of their other stuff. They have sandwiches, teriyaki bowls, wraps etc. The service was great too. Located inside Miracle Miles shop in Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. I've been eating here every day that I'm embarrassed to because the workers must think I'm crazy. I'm sorry but, if I like something...Imma eat there til I tire of it...and that'll prolly take me a while...If you know me, I'm a creature of habit.   Thankfully, I've tried to eat different things every time I've eaten there and I-LOVE-IT-ALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!  My favorite is their campfire, mambo wrap, thai cone, spa wraps! Their homemade chips are to die for... AND they have a sauce bar --- A SAUCE BAR!!!! Let's be honest and say: Everything taste better with bbq or ranch =)  SAMPS THIS. Trust me!"}
{"text":"Came here two get our frozen drinks because we had a Groupon Deal. Never had any of their food.  We had  two for one yard drinks. :)"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the Restaurant.com coupons I would not have come. There is nothing remotely appealing. The food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Place is pretty cool! It's a good spot to eat at if you're looking for a casual place to dine after a long day of shopping. They have a bar with all the assortments of sauces you can get your hands on, and that fun new Coca Cola soda dispenser that lets you make your own soda. If you check in you get a free side of their homemade potato chips.   I ordered their buffalo chicken wrap which was pretty good. Tasted like what you would expect of a buffalo chicken wrap. They had other stuff too. Hot sandwiches like Philly cheese steaks. Cold sandwiches like a club sandwich. Chicken wraps, and healthy plates like their chicken breast plate with mixed veggies. You can also pick one side with most dishes, and I picked the sweet potato fries which were also good as well.  If you want to kill two birds with one stone, you can also order a nice alcoholic slush beverage or any drink at that over there in a yard stick or one of those big plastic souvenir cup containers.   Nothing really out of the ordinary to differentiate it from other eateries, but this place surely does the job."}
{"text":"Was trying to go to Earl of Sandwich down the hallway, but the was crazy long, so found this hidden gem.  I had a delicious Asian Chicken salad - really amazing!  The line was quick, though had to wait a bit for the food, but not too long.  Given the reasonably cheap prices in an overpriced Las Vegas, this is a great find for a quick lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"It's located inside PH right next to the parking lot escalators. It's on the corner and you might miss it if you're thoroughly sloshed.   I was planning to get manageably belligerent and wanted those yard drinks from Fat Tuesday's but seeing the long, long long line, decided to come here instead. I had purchased the Groupon deal for 2 yard drinks earlier in the day ($21 for 2) and decided that now was as good a time to get drunk as...well all the time in Vegas.  1) The drinks were not strong. It was basically drinking peach slushy. I know they're probably trying to get you to purchase an extra shot, but I didn't want it.  2) Rude. Holy cow. The cashier was impatient and rude as all hell. I don't know why, as there were no lines. Was I disturbing her chat time with her coworker? I don't careeeeeeee.  3) They overcharged me by almost $10. This was on top of the Groupon. When I pointed that out to her, she just shrugged and said they already made the drinks for me. So what?! Ugh. FINE. At $32 for 2 it's still cheaper than buying at full price. I'm in Vegas to have a good time, not to deal with some idiot who can't do math or punch in correct totals on the cash register.    I give you an extra star because the yard cup had a happy face and reminded me not to throw a temper tantrum."}
{"text":"The strawberry daiquiri is off the hook. The BBQ chicken quesadilla is yum. It's good and pretty healthy for a fast-food style restaurant."}
{"text":"Tip: The 1/2 yard frozen alcoholic drinks are the best bargain in the mall at $11... and the pina colada version  was sinfully good!  DIP BAR!!!!!! I am a CONDIMENT freak , so to my joy, I was grateful to find a CONDIMENT/ DIP bar to enhance my nicely seasoned, breaded Chicken Fingers and fresh homemade potato chips.  Dip bar: Cilantro Ranch, Ranch, BBQ, Honey Mustard, Cilantro vinagrette, Soy/Peanut sauce, Salsa(s), Ketchup,  mustard, etc...."}
{"text":"You know those wussie guitar Slurpee drinks you always see touristy douchbags walking around Vegas with? Well it turns out some of them have some kick! I tried a half yard of the moonshine with two extra shots of everclear and I pretty much had to be carried home! Stop here if you dare!"}
{"text":"Ho hum! Spent $21 using the groupon for 2- yard drinks....with alcohol..... instead I got a slushie! After sipping my juice for a while and noticing I wasn't getting a buzz I threw mines away! Word of advice go to FAT TUESDAYS at least you get a buzz! If I wanted a slushie I would go to the 7-11."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas four times since last year, and every time I go I go to Fresh Grill and bar for lunch.  I get a coupon from restaurants.com and with that coupon 4 people eat very well.  The food is good, and the sauces are good. The chicken tenders are good, the  burger is good, and every thing taste really fresh."}
{"text":"Great place to get your drink on... Bought a teaser size drink for $11 and refills for $6.  Easy to order on the bar side.  Others in our party ordered food which looked tasty.  I will return when in the area for sure."}
{"text":"One word: MOONSHINE.  It's all you need to get drunk enough to pass out mid afternoon and do a bunch of crazy shit you'll never remember.  'nuff said."}
{"text":"First off,  we live in Vegas and were looking for someplace great, healthy, and amazing since CREATE closed down. This place was NOT IT! the hassle it was to get here was a double whammy on the SUCK METER! its in a food court which was not what was expected it wad really expensive for the small amount of generic food you get, we left STARVING AND MAD!  I don't understand why Yelpers are raving about this place.... they must be from out if town and WASTED because this place was awful!!!"}
{"text":"How could I forget about this place.. I know I was extremely hammered after the Wet Republic to even remember that I ate here until my friend reminded me the other day!! lol  From what I remember I came here to Tacone in Planet Hollywood....& I ordered the great gobbler sandwhich which was shredded chicken, cheese, avocado, bacon ,& other such toppings I can't recall but it tasted quite delicious @ the time...& they had a sauce bar with a variety of sauces from chipotle bbq, cilantro ranch, honey mustard dijon, & the list goes on of deliciousness...  ya this place was the most affordable thing I ate that whole weekend seeing that my friend bought me a sandwhich gave me an extra $5 to take a cab back cause I spend all my money on booze ..yes definitely will remember this place & try it again"}
{"text":"Used the Groupon deal - 2 yard-longs for $22.  in a way, it is worth it if you're using the Groupon deal, otherwise do not waste your time and money. You definitely need to add at least 3 more shots to taste the liquor.  We didn't purchase any food, nothing seemed appetizing. We didn't finish our drinks, I'm guessing because whatever we ate prior to the drinks didn't agree with out stomachs.  The sever came off as rude - she demanded our IDs and the Groupon deal, and was very impatient about it.  Will not be returning.  Giving two stars for the Groupon deal."}
{"text":"My wife and I were walking around the Miracle Mile shops in Planet Hollywood and we came across the Tacone Flavor Grill. We were hungry at that time, so we decided to give this place a chance. There's many items to choose from the menu. There are wraps, platters, quesadillas, and more. I decided to get the filet mignon platter which consisted of strips of filet mignon, a side salad, and seasoned fries. The filet mignon was a little dry, but I added some type of green salsa which kicked it up a notch. There's a flavor bar that consisted of various sauces ranging from ranch, smoked bbq, and green salsa to name a few.   The price is reasonable compared to other eateries, and the service could have been better. Nonetheless, it was a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in because of a restaurant.com coupon and it was a great deal, good food reasonable price especially on the strip! Just make sure to do a screen shot of your restaurant.com coupon as the reception/ wifi was really slow"}
{"text":"Had yard long in strawberry daq, piña colada, and moonshine. Although they were all good, moonshine was by far the best- I could taste the alcohol. I also snacked on some fries while drinking my slush. The variety of dipping sauces were delicious. Overall I was pleased with my experience. I had the group-on for the 2 drinks for 21. A pretty good deal, I wouldn't pay full price for these things- HOWEVER I let my groupon expire so of course they honored the dollar amount I paid. I would be more happier if they gave me the deal since they still advertise it on groupon."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the drinks there I opted for the extra shots and I felt pretty good half way through the drink.  The staff was very accommodating and the groupon helped alot, people asked when I was walking where I got the drink and I made sure to send them your way. The reason for 4 stars is the coffee flavored drink the kahula shots cost more than the regular shots. But over all I would return it was great."}
{"text":"This was a recommended spot that we tried, happy that we did. The BLT was yummy.  The coke machine, the choices, loved it. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The prices were terrific, I just wish we had one locally."}
{"text":"For a place that has to deal with drunk Vegas tourists all day, the people are remarkably nice and accommodating.  They happily let us taste all of the frozen drinks before we decided, they mixed up two of the drinks for me (pina colada and strawberry daiquiri - yum!) and they scrubbed our souvenir glass when we brought it back for a refill.  Oh, and they didn't seem at all put out by having to call to confirm our restaurant.com voucher.    Regarding the actual food and drink, I'm not a huge fan of frozen drinks, but these were amazing.  They told me that they only use real fruit for flavoring and it shows.  I also had a steak and cheese sandwich which was fine, but unremarkable.  Certainly not bad, though.  Bottom line: super friendly staff, delicious drinks, and decent food."}
{"text":"Walking through the Miracle Mile shops, we were all the way in the back end when a sudden flare of back pain made finding alcohol a necessity.  Fortunately, that's not a tall order in Vegas and Fresh Grill & Bar offers a variety of those frozen slushy drinks that come in all sizes, ranging from 'wow' to 'holy ricrapadiculous'.  Not being total degenerates at this point, we stayed towards the wow end of the scale.  It's organized with one side of the counter for just food orders and the other side for drinks - so the former was empty while the latter had a short line.  It took a bit of time for them to get organized enough to take my order, but they were all running around so I guess it was busier than it seemed?  We went with the pina colada and it was tasty, although I probably should've paid for the extra shot because as another reviewer mentioned, you don't really notice the booze at all.  We didn't try the food as nothing really appealed - there is an odd mix of sandwiches, wraps, and asian noodle dishes.    In short, nothing worth venturing out of your way for, but if you're in the area and want a frozen booze drink, this is a perfectly valid option."}
{"text":"OMG we had a groupon deal for this place for their yard drinks, $22 for 2 ( org. $19 ea.), which was good, however I had the strawberry daiquiri and it tasted like an over sugary sweet slushie, good at first, but too much as time went.  I also ordered a BLT, now that I enjoyed very much. For $6.99 you get the BLT and choose of side, not bad considering your in Planet Hollywood on the strip.   I will come back and try another flavor of slush though, my friend got the piña colada and liked that."}
{"text":"this place is bangin! we used a groupon for 2 drinks for 21 i believe, and they were great. did the moonshine.  went back another day for the girly to eat something, and she said it was the best burger she ate out there, vs the famed in n out and jack in the box. place was very clean, with the fixing bar girl cleaning that, at least 3 times in the 20 minutes we were there. not big at all, but a very good joint for sure. would gladly go back there again next time in vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"This is a decent fast food style restaurant with tex-mex style wraps, sandwiches, grill entrees, soup and salad.  The food is quite similar to other fast food wrap places like World Wraps.  The distinction is that they have a sauce bar featuring more than 10 different kinds of dipping sauce for the seasoned potato chips.  The potato chips were made from real potatoes, baked not fried.  So they were not oily but very hard and dry.  I ordered the Spa wrap, which includes Grilled Zucchini, Yellow Squash, Red Bell Peppers, Carrots, Spinach, Feta + Balsamic Vinaigrette.  It was filled with all of the mentioned ingredients for $7.99.   I thought the wrap was good, although a bit dry.  But you can put it whatever sauce you want from the sauce bar.    A good place to go to for a cheap, quick and healthy bite (esp on the Strip)."}
{"text":"public service announcement: if you come here for the 2 for one 1 groupon deal, please note that unless you have a HUGE stomach you will not be able to finish these (without puking up later) due to their sheer volume.  Plan to sip on it throughout the day? Well the vegas heat will melt these down to a syrupy goo in no time.   I gave this my most valiant effort to finish as much as I could and it earned me a early trip back to my room with a stomach ache. I gave this 4 stars because these drinks actually taste really good... if I return I would get a much smaller portion."}
{"text":"Wow this place was gross. For a healthy restaurant, I expected much more. Their salads seemed like they were from pre-made packs that you get from the grocery store or something. My friends and I came here for lunch intending on a healthy meal, but I was so grossed out by my food I literally only took 2 bites and threw it away.   And I even got the Chinese Chicken Salad which is so basic and common! I should've taken a pic of it but I didn't. My friend got the veggie salad and WOW that looked so shriveled up and dead! It was so disgusting to look at. The veggies were all wilted....   The only good thing about this place is 1) you get $5 off your purchase of $25 if you check in on yelp...but honestly I would not even spend $20 here so idk if that deal is worth it...2) their slushy drinks are on point! So goood! But doesn't make up for the horrible tasting food."}
{"text":"Food was less than mediocre. With a name like \"Fresh\" you'd think the food was fresh. I'm pretty sure my chicken in my Baja chicken bowl was some kind of pre-frozen strips and the ranch sauce tasted like it came out of a salad dressing bottle, and my husband's fries must have been frozen. I took a bite of his steak and cheese sandwich and bleck...we spent $24.95 on 2 meals but I wished I walked a little bit inside the mall to Chipotle for much better quality food. Service was subpar, girl who helped us seemed like she couldn't be bothered with us. Try something else unless you don't care about consuming cheap junk."}
{"text":"Vegas is a scene of fine dining and buffets but if you want some cheap and fast diner style food, this place is not a bad choice. This place is neither are bar nor is it fresh but for under 10 bucks you can get a filling meal. They have basic stuff like burgers, wraps and quesadilla plates which come with sides. Basically they serve good drunk food and in Vegas, that is not a bad idea."}
{"text":"Food is not the best but was okay.  We ordered rice bowl with steak and they didn't mention about the extra cost for steak meat.  They don't give you a lot of fries so the extra 2.99 was not worth it. I feel like I paid more for drinks then fires."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that the homemade potato chips are extremely good!! Don't forget to use your Yelp check in and you get it for free!  I came here and I had a Groupon deal that I had not you for over 2 years! the deal was $21 for 2 tall souvenir drinks!  Because of the deal being all would only got one for $21 and had to buy the other 1 418 connection. Which is not a bad deal, especially for the amount of alcohol that's in there!   They have many different varieties of flavors. And because I'm too picky I decided to try two different flavors!   The staff were very friendly, & I also enjoyed that they let us sample all the different flavors before we bought it lol.  Too bad I was not too hungry or I would have grabbed a bite to eat! Food smells so good when you walk through the door. Check out Groupon as they always have deals on there! I hear that they are the cheapest in the mall! Knowing how vegas can be very expensive having places like these can be a very good deal!  I would definitely recommend coming here! And checking out the potato chips. If you are not a big drinker please note that this is a huge souvenir drink and may be too big but they also have many different sizes and varieties."}
{"text":"2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 96/365  We used a groupon for the big yard drinks and they were really cool about it. Great deal to split the cost with friends when you have the groupon. We added 4 extra shots, which already had 4 shots in it? so this totally got the job done quick! So much fun walking the casino and strip with my big beer bottle filled with a stiff margarita!"}
{"text":"First off, I only had the frozen drinks.... a few times.  They are soooo good!  I purchased the 2  Groupon Yards for $21, a $36 value.  They were very accommodating  with this, and I even paid a couple dollars more for extra shots... you can definitely taste and feel the alcohol in these drinks.  The staff was very friendly as well. There are many of the frozen drink places in Vegas, but these really are great, we ended up taking our yards back a couple of times during our week for refills.  Highly suggest the Moonshine!"}
{"text":"FRESH?? No. Completely misleading. I went there on my last trip to LV, and i was looking for some fresh, healthy food in between the bar runs. I got the Chinese Chicken Salad. Sounds healthy enough, no? Comes out looking great. Until I cut into the \"chicken\". It is not at all \"Fresh\" or even real looking. It was that fake, press board chicken like product you get in Mcdonalds salads. It's CHICKEN people. The cheapest meat on the market!!! I'm not saying it has to be organic, but it should be REAL CHICKEN BREAST!!! Not fattening packaged crap! I threw all the chicken out, ate the salad, and did not return. You should avoid this place. There are too many amazing places to eat at Miracle Mile/PH..."}
{"text":"I was walking around the Miracle Mile shops at the Planet Hollywood Hotel on my way to the parking garage to get my car, and decided to grab a quick bite to eat. I happened to pass by this place so I decided to stop by and check out their menu. The pictures on their menu looked appetizing so I went with the grilled chicken wrap combo meal, which came with a side of seasoned fries and a drink.   My order came and it was surprisingly good. They have a condiment flavor bar that offered various sauces from smoked bbq, ranch dressing, honey mustard, salsa, ketchup, house dressing, etc.. pretty much anything you might need to spice up your wrap or sandwich. I was looking through their menu and noticed that they also offer quesadillas, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, and mixed alcoholic drinks and beer. I was tempted to get a margarita, but I was on my way to a business meeting and decided to just skip the spirits for now and make it up later on that night.  Overall, my experience here was pleasant and the employees are friendly. They really do stand by their motto of serving food that is fresh and flavorful. A good alternative to the other fancy and more expensive food places along the Miracle Mile shops.."}
{"text":"Fresh Grill and Bar Micracle Mile shops: The steak panini was good. Honey mustard chicken wrap was so so. Fries were alright. Sauce bar! If you are wandering around PH and want quick decent food that is affordable this is the place to be. Oh and for some strange reason, their cups have Tacone written on them..."}
{"text":"i got the spa wrap. Lots of roasted veggies all wrapped up. Hubbyygot the mambo wrap lots of meat! Don't forget the wounderful sauces bar!! Cilantro lime sauce mmm guud! Sweet potaoe fries are awesome!! The only bad thing needs improvement in SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling very well on the first night of my Vegas trip so my boyfriend and I decided to eat at the hotel we were staying at.  Thus, we ended up at Fresh Grill & Bar which is located at the Miracle Mile Shops in PH.  My boyfriend ordered the Fish Wrap and I got the Santa Fe Salad (grilled chicken, romaine lettuce, mashed avocado, cheddar cheese, corn, salsa, and garlic tortilla strips).  The fish wrap was delicious but pretty small for the price that you pay (but hey...it's Vegas so everything's more expensive).  The salad on the other hand was huge.  The ingredients were fresh and I liked that they had a dressing bar so you can pick and choose your dressing, which allows you to try different flavor combinations.  The recommended dressing was a Cilantro Ranch one (that was okay) but I liked the Cilantro Lime one better (a little lighter).  Overall, an okay place to eat at but nothing to write home about.  I would have loved to try their Moonshine daiquiri though...sucks being sick in Vegas! =/"}
{"text":"I always come here with our groupon deal. I always take my souvenir home too.  The flavors are good and you can mix the flavors and you can also sample them. I wouldn't say their the best but they sure do beat a lot of other places out there."}
{"text":"It took an EXCESSIVE amount of time for them to make my food. I got the turkey wrap and the amount of time they took to make my wrap led me to believe that they were roasting a thanksgiving turkey and carving it just to make my turkey sandwich. Well the description did say \"Homemade fresh Roasted Turkey shredded by hand\".  I took a bite of my wrap expecting greatness and I was utterly disappointed. My turkey lacked flavor, the whole wrap itself was bland. I WAITED WELL OVER 30 MINUTES FOR THIS?   The homemade potato chips were interesting and not bad but it makes you feel oh-so-horrible after consuming em cause they are so heavy.   Fresh Grill & Bar gave me a massive heartburn on my ride back to LA from Vegas. Never again."}
{"text":"Here`s the deal:  I ordered BBQ chicken quesadilla, but I did not get a chance to eat it.  While waiting for my order, my astute son noticed that the food preparer was handling the food with bare hands.  I watched this girl open hand sling food around with ungloved bare hands.  I am from New York, and there is no way that would go down.  My son works at Starbucks, and apparently they require their employees to wash their hands up to the elbows for 25 seconds, and they still  must wear gloves.  Moreover, Starbucks employees do not cook, and handle mostly packaged food.  Obviously I returned to the counter and informed the cashier that the food preparer was handling food with bare hands, that I do not consume food handled in an unsanitary way,  and that I would need my money returned. She offered that, ¨she )the food preparer) washes her hands.¨  For the récord  it is not acceptable to handle food with bare hands, period.  And of course hands should be washed thoroughly prior to handling food, but how many times do people go to the bathroom without exercising appropriate care, or touch their face, rub their nose, or touch unssanitry surfaces thoughtlessly.... trust me, demand that your food preparers cover up.   I am hoping that this review gets back to the management of this facility."}
{"text":"I came with my Groupon for the slushy drinks. I had strawberry & my boyfriend had pina colda. They were both sugary and didn't give us a buzz like we hoped! We're in Vegas often, we most likely won't go back for the drinks or to try the food."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for two drinks for $21. Staff was great and line was pretty short! We were offered free samples and both got the peach daiquiris with three extra shots each which was only $4 extra dollars! The drinks were very yummy and tasted more fresh than other frozen drinks on the strip! We did not finish our drinks though. It was 108 degrees and we walked two miles with them and they got warm and too sugary. I had plan people walking by comment on my large pink cup and saying how yummy it looked! I would recommend getting the beer bottle shaped cup though, it is a bit smaller but has a lid and handle!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Ordered a variety for a group of 30 people and everyone raved.  Wings and chicken fingers were perfect and the wraps were awesome."}
{"text":"Holy crap, my husband and I went here because I had a Groupon for 2 yard drinks. We both ordered the \"Moonshine\" in classy 42 oz beer bottle shaped yard. We each added one extra shot to our drinks because it was cheap to do the add on.  Uhhh, by the end of our drinks we were both toasty to say the least! Be careful with these guys! We do recommend them for sure, but we both just wish yard drinks weren't so sugary! A++"}
{"text":"Not bad. Big portions. Really good sweet potato fries.   I like how they have a bar filled with sauces and dressings to customize your meal.  Got the cobb grilled chicken salad. Not bad. Filled with chicken and... lettuce. I would have asked for them to skip the bacon because it didn't really do much for the salad... even though cobbs are supposed to have it. If you're ever here, order the cobb, it'll be filling and you'll still feel like you ate something relatively healthy for your meal."}
{"text":"Don't go to Fat Tuesday's for drinks! Come here! Staff here are super friendly and they ALWAYS have groupon deals for their big frozen drinks. We always buy a few before we go to Vegas. Extra shots are only $1 for one or $2 for 3! You can't beat it. We walk by Fat Tuesday's and laugh at the people in line paying high prices for weak drinks. We LOVE this place not only for the good drinks, good prices, but the friendly staff as well. They are Inside Planet Hollywood on the strip. If it's big frozen strong drinks you want, get the groupon. But make sure you buy it 12 hours ahead of time as it's not good until that time. Plan ahead!"}
{"text":"If there was a way that I could give this fast food place next to the mall parking lot no stars, I would. As an employee working inside the Miracle Mile Shops for the last two years, I have eaten here countless times. But my recent trip on my lunch break to grab a quick bite to eat had me very frustrated and utterly upset.   I have been in the food industry before and I completely understand the struggles of working in such a fast paced environment like the Strip, but always as customer service 101 teaches you. No matter what, do what you can, whatever you can to make your customers stay at your restaurant enjoyable. It is just not worth making a customer upset enough to write a review on the customer service they recieved.  I had called in advance to order Chicken fingers and sweet potato fries. But when I got there I noticed that my takeout container had an extra brown bag over it. My server was Ada and she explained that the cooks had made a mistake and made my order with the wrong fries, so they just added my sweet potato fries in the bag. I thought that was strange but I paid for my food. I opened up the packaging and saw a bunch of regular shoestring fries with my chicken fingers (just like Ada said) but when I looked into the brown bag where my sweet potato fries were - there were only a couple of fries in the bottom of the bag. I was upset and I asked the cashier that my order was done wrong and there are only a couple of the fries  that I ordered in this bag.  I explained to her that since it was their mistake can she just comp an order of sweet potato fries for me for the next time I come back to eat, or give me more of what I ordered and paid for.  She turned to Ada explained and Ada came to me and said - \"you only get a small portion.\" I was in no mood to explain that the wrong fries were stacked in my takeout container and they only gave me scraps of what i really ordered on the side.  I told Ada that i just want what I ordered, she then asks, \"do you want me to throw this away?\" I was shocked by how rude she was being when THEY got MY order WRONG! I wish it ended there,  but once I sat down at their location to eat the food, their manager came from around the back and was staring me down.    I am extremely upset and will never eat there again.  Most of my coworkers always warned me about this place,  but now I know that I should've taken their advice.  Food was okay but the CUSTOMER SERVICE was horrible."}
{"text":"Good but not great. I had the burger and fries and it was filling but nothing to rave about.  Think \"mall food\""}
{"text":"Giving a 3 because I'm being generous. Wanted to give a 2.5.   My sissy bout us a Groupon to get Yard-long drinks for us to sip on during our Vegas vacation. I'm a long time Fat Tuesday customer and look forward to my Vegas trips just so I can get some FAt Tuesday. But really, who can pass up 2 for 1 yard longs?!? So we decided to try it.   We get to Fresh Bar & Grill on a cloudy Monday afternoon. The cashier is semi-friendly. She shows us the menu for the drinks we can get.  There were about 8 options for us to fill our yard longs with. I picked the \"Miami Vice\" which was a strawberry piña colada. I got the extra shot for $1 - which is necessary if you want a taste of alcohol.   It was good for the Groupon price; however, I think I'll be sticking to Fat Tuesday my next time out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I have eaten the grilled steak sandwich and the grilled chicken sandwich. The homemade potatoe chips are great as well. Friendly employees, and they serve coke products"}
{"text":"Stopped by the bar to use our groupon we bought for drinks. Not a huge selection of the frozen drinks. But they are pretty much the same as everyone else on the strip selling the yard drinks."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because they have an awesome buffalo chicken wrap, and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg (rare for Vegas and their upcharging ways).  Only way this place could be better is add some bleu cheese to the wrap, and stay open all night for those late night cravings.  If you're staying at Planet Hollywood and need a quick, tasty, and relatively healthy sandwich or wrap, hit this place up."}
{"text":"Here's the skinny: I had a restaurant.com certificate for Fresh Grill & Bar that was burning a hole in my virtual wallet. I finally had an excuse to use it on a random Monday night! The menu is plentiful. There's salads, wraps, sandwiches, nachos, teriyaki bowls, etc. (you get the picture). I had a taco salad wrap with their seasoned fries and the Mr. had the chicken club sandwich combo. The total bill came to $15 and some change. Not bad for a meal for two on the strip!   The taco wrap had some odd looking wild rice in it and the appearance of the wrap was underwhelming, but whatevs it still tasted good! My husband really liked his wrap too. The fries were just meh. I wish they were warmer and not so sad looking.   Service was average and the wait time for our order was under 5 minutes. The cashier kindly brought our order to the table. Seating is awkward and crowded, which is why we opted to sit on the outskirts of the restaurant.    There's an awesome dressing bar with some really unique sauces at Fresh Grill & Bar. I extensively sampled the jalapeno ranch and the cilantro ranch. These sauces definitely contributed to the yum factor of my wrap!  I'll come back to Fresh Grill & Bar, but only if I have a coupon and if I'm in a hurry (which I usually am whenever I'm on the Strip)."}
{"text":"I found this place in a Yelp search, however it didnt say exactly where the restaurant was. Well its inside the miracle shopping mile.   I had a hard time finding this place, because well...im a dumb ass. As it turns out miracle mile mall is yes! a mile long. So i had to walk a half mile around to get there. It was worth it though.   The food was good, not great. But it was also very affordable! The thing i liked best is the little sauce bar they have setup. The cilantro ranch sauce is delicious.   Also you can get booze here! Viva Las Vegas! The food is good and its inexpensive"}
{"text":"Everyone that has written a negative review here is WHACK. This place is a gem. Every time me and my husband go to Vegas we stop here. You can't beat the awesome groupon deal. The buffalo tossed chicken strips combined with their home made sauces, are delicious. The ladies up front are very nice and are clearly service-oriented. Compared to most overpriced joints in Vegas, I would choose here any time. Me and my husband have at least been here 5 times and we have yet to be disappointed. Plus they make their slushies with REAL FRUIT. Fat Tuesday can't say that."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best for an $8 Grilled Veggies wrap. Zucchini, yellow squash, red bell peppers, carrots, spinach and balsamic vinaigrette. I thought the bbq chips that came on the side were much more exciting.  But I liked their cilantro sauce at the salsa bar. Tangy! Get some of that stuff :D"}
{"text":"Um... the yards were more expensive here than Fat Tuesdays... and they didn't have as many flavors to choose from!  And they're around $16 I believe? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fresh-grill-and-bar-las-vegas-3?select=ccumoblULOPLgWiYouHLqQ#ccumoblULOPLgWiYouHLqQ"}
{"text":"O.M.G!! This place has an AMAZING sandwhich. Well the United Steak of America at least was great. It was hot and flavorful. Not something you find often in a sandwhich. I wish I didn't wolf it down as fast since I was running to catch the \"V\" Variety Show. The smoothy I had wasn't as good though. Well more like I didn't enjoy having a drink with a mouth full of hard seeds every time i took a sip. It just tasted grainy feeling. But the sandwhich I had totally made up for it.   They also grilled the steak on FRESH right after we ordered which is why it took about 10 minutes for us to get it and have to inhale the food. AHHHH. My mouth is just watering thinking about that sandwhich."}
{"text":"Being in Vegas you would expect the girl behind the counter would be able to make a drink. They had some special going with a coupon, and it was obvious the girls were getting frustrated with the customers in front of me. It took close to ten minutes just to give my order. Then I had to show the girl which bottle was grey goose. So disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a quick bite to eat after drinking a little bit too much. Shocker! Anyway, we need to soak up some of the alcohol and opt for a cheaper option in Vegas to eat. This place had an assortment of eats but we opt for 2 wraps. I had decided on the Buffalo chicken wrap (had a kick to it) and my husband ordered the honey mustard chicken wrap. Both wraps were decent and they also came with chips on the side. I wasn't a fan of the chips as they were super greasy. I am not a good judge of this only because I normally do not eat chips. But if you have alcohol in your belly, something has to soak it up."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places we grabbed a quick meal in Vegas. The price was right and I loved the healthy side options without there being an extra charge. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Margarita!! Yum. It's not a trip to Vegas without drinking a frozen beverage that is about half the length of your body. Their \"moonshine\" margarita is still weak compared to a real margarita, but the kicker is getting to the bottom of the tube and slurping down all the alcohol that sinks to the bottom. Delicious!  The food actually looks pretty good too. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm.  Cheapest meal I had the entire time I was in Vegas thanks to a restaurant.com gift certificate.    I had the Thai Cone and the hubby had the Steak Sandwich.  Both were good and the homemade potato chips were the bomb, as were many of the free sauces.  I wish there was a Tacone closer to home!"}
{"text":"My ladyfriend gets tipsy on one glass of wine..she drank the whole lemonade drink supposedly infused with alcohol and felt nothing...and she is the one whi staggers twice a year on 2 glasses of wine at Christmas..a Slushy..nothing more..not worth the $24 we paid at Groupon..for 2 slush drinks similar the refills we got the next day at Walgreens on the strip for $1.99@"}
{"text":"The check-in deal is for alcohol, so if you are like me and just cruising around looking for a snack don't get excited.  The grilled veggie wrap hit the spot on Meat Free Monday.  So much that I came back for the fish wrap later on.  I love the sauce bar. It's kept clean and adds just enough flavor to their fresh meals.  Three stars because of the weird vibe from the staff.  It's as if they couldn't be bothered by me and my stupid questions."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the food, it wasn't authentic to my liking. However, if u only consider drinks...re-think this establishment, the 3 times I went it was watered down, hardly no alcohol and too much sweetness (syrup) I would not consider trying them a 4th time, the drinks were very over priced and generic."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite and chose the bbq chicken quesadilla from their menu. It comes with chips and salsa, too. I got a frozen pina-colada to wash it all down.   The quesadilla was pretty good, especially dipped in some ranch dressing from the little sauce bar. That was cool especially for ppl like me who love sauces! I didn't like the salsa. It was more like pico de gallo instead of salsa. The drink tasted good but if there was any alcohol in it, it was very very little.   At the end of the day, it's a cheap meal at a decent value served up by nice people!"}
{"text":"Had a thai wrap here for dinner. Maybe it was the alcoholic slushee I had earlier, but I'm not a fan. Too much plain rice (filler), just kinda blah chicken with some cabbage and ok peanut sauce. In a blah tortilla. Maybe I'll come back for the drinks. And skip the food."}
{"text":"1 word: WHY????!!!  Bought a Groupon for this place since I was visiting Sin City over the weekend.  There were a bunch of people standing around not doing anything, and the girl who took my order looked like she could care less about working and wanted to go home.  She wasn't friendly and neither was anybody else behind the counter.  How do you mess up a Chinese Chicken Salad wrap, How I say? For the $11 I paid I would rather have eaten my sock covered in honey Dijon mustard.  The 1 star is actually for my drink, the Moonshine w/ Everclear, which was tasty and clearly the highlight of my visit.   If you find yourself in the Miracle Mile shops and your stomach is growling, you would rather walk another mile than eat at this place."}
{"text":"For being on the strip this food is the Best deal around. Both the salad and sandwiches are good and super cheap. The SAUCES are where its at! The salad dressing and other sauces are the highlight!"}
{"text":"For our first meal in Vegas, we decided to go Mexican. After walking around the Miracle Mile Mall, this was the first thing that caught our eye. Location wise, it's probably not the best considering you'd have to go all the way around the one mile mall to get to where it is.   Chatty staff, good service and an awesome selection of food (platters, wraps, burgers, sandwiches etc). I ordered the Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap and Chips and Salsa. My friend got the BBQ Chicken Wings. My wrap had chunks of avocado, which wins big bucks in my book. I love avocado especially if it's integrated nicely into a dish. It makes me very happy. It was quite a portion actually. One of my concerns was that it was quite greasy. But I guess I can't expect a lot from fast food. I wasn't aware that there was going to be a side of chips (which I believe were deep fried, hand cut potatoes). If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the side of chips and salsa. No biggie on those, just chips and salsa.   The wings were also just ordinary. It wasn't bad but it wasn't to die for either.   I like the nice island in the middle of the store that held all the dips and sauces. I thought that was pretty cool. There was a nice variety that patrons can enjoy.  Perhaps my favorite part about this store was the line up that leads to the alcoholic drink orders (there was a line for non alcoholic orders and a line for alcoholic orders). They have these really tall plastic containers that held slushie drinks. I got the smallest one, which was a half yard long slushie drink, (double shot of course) named Happy Ending. I loved it so much I came back for seconds. Really great for those days when you walk down the strip and its 35 degrees hot out.   Oh and if you save your drink container and bring it next time to get your drink, it's cheaper. Some people actually brought theirs back. I should have, but seeing as I was drunk for virtually the entire trip, I don't remember where I put my first container so I just got another one.  Would I come back? Probably for the food. Definitely yes for the drink. Me wants me Happy Ending."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the longyards.  Our group purchased the Groupon deal for $13 for a longyad. We got a 40 oz. beer bottle-shaped longyard. Before we purchased the drinks to put in our longyards we got to sample all the drinks they had to offer. My two favorite was the Strawberry & Happy Ending which was like a sweet tea lemonade. But we decided to just have strawberry which was pretty yummy.   I will say that their claim of there being 4 & a half shots in each yard is BS. We bought an extra shot just incase & good thing we did cause that thing didn't have any kick at all.. oi.. I shared with one other person & didn't even feel a slight buzz. LAME! Needless to say we didn't get a refill because it just made us bloated with liquid & no buzz. =[   PLUS! The beer bottle yard can be used as a piggy bank too! [=  Oh! If you \"like\" their fb page you get a FREE order of sweet potato fries, I think hm?"}
{"text":"Very low quality food and a very watered down $11.00 margarita.   Would not recommend.  Will not ever come back."}
{"text":"Hrm. Slightly regretting not walking the extra bit to get to Earl's instead. First meal in Vegas, this restaurant has the prime location because it is right next to the PH parking structure (which is MILES away from the casino portion of the hotel). We were intrigued by all the different sandwich/salad selection they had and the \"free samples\" offering for their alcoholic slushie drinks.   We got the Chicken Club to share, which came with an order of chips. I liked that they had all sorts of dipping sauce/dressing for the chips/salad, but we mostly needed it for the super bland sandwich, which cost $9!!! This place reminds me of Tacone! And there wasn't that many people there, but the wait was pretty long for our sandwich.   Sooooooooo many other places to eat, go to Earl's!"}
{"text":"Rule #3 of Vegas: Buy a huge ass drink the size of your torso to carry with you as you walk The Strip.  I purchased a couple of Groupon deals before coming here, something silly like 20 bucks for 2 drinks. If only I had known how sweet the drinks actually were I would have only got one of the deals as we ended up not using the 2nd. Oh well.  Set up: Casual bar with the usual fried food and vast array of alcoholic drinks. With the ''Yard longs'' you pick your cup, then your flavor and any additional Alcohol shots if you want them. The drinks are already pre made in a slushy machine, I kinda wish I had got an extra shot as I couldn't taste what was in there and it might have toned down the sweetness of it all. Service was fine and the drinks were ok but way too much for both myself and my Husband as neither of us drank more than half of it.   Will I ever return to use that other Groupon on another trip? Probably not."}
{"text":"the ceasar salad that I got for lunch was drenched in so much dressing that it was kind of disgusting.  when I went and asked the front if I could get more lettuce they kind of looked at me like I was crazy.  You would think that an establishment with the word \"Fresh\" in the name would know how to make a decent salad.  Sorry but I'm adding this to the list of places to NOT eat at this mall."}
