{"text":"Lehman's deli used to be a staple for my co-workers and me. That is until they raised their prices beyond what already seemed steep. Their subs -dressed with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion- are tasty but will leave you wanting more. I particularly enjoyed the pastrami and turkey sub. They will make any sub to your liking. 

Their menu is large and they have a variety of items in their fridge. This deli has options for everyone (subs, sandwiches, appetizers, gyros, salads, fruit etc.). All are delectable but a bit overpriced. There is also a wide selection of wine and beer. 

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere possesses a pastoral feel. I have a soft spot for this establishment (we go way back). If you have a few extra bucks in your pocket for lunch, give it a try! You won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"A true hidden treasure with a real traditional, small town feel. I went in 20 minutes before they closed and got a great Reuben and an order of thick onion rings. The Reuben was stacked with an inch of roast beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut. The rings were thick and the breading was light, baked slightly dark and crispy. The banana bread with pudding was also great."}
{"text":"Very good food, I haven't had anything I wouldn't recommend, but if you see the Lobster Mac and Cheese on the daily special, GO. It's amazing and worth the little extra you'd expect to pay for a lunch soup.

My only negative feedback, the owner is NEVER in a good mood, so don't be surprised if it feels like you're bothering him."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday. The staff was excellent, and my turkey club sub was amazing. Really, the perfect sub for me! 

Cole slaw was good as well, and we also had their housemade unsweet tea, which were both also very good. 

We will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"The interior of lehman's deli has no tables inside you have to eat outside in very cold or warm weather this place must not get any business during winter time service is slow I had the pastrami Reubens and it wasn't bad it had the perfect amount of sauce and I enjoy that in a sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer.  It's a great deli for lunch or take home, with friendly service.  They have a large selection and the portions are very generous (especially the sandwiches). The fries, soups  and sandwiches are very, very good. The soups are \"homemade\" and delicious (try the vegetarian chili) and there are lots of choices. This is one my favorite places."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to stop and grab a bite to eat! Great little spot, don't hesitate to give them some business! You won't regret it. 

They have all kinds of different sandwiches and a different selection of soups every day so there's always something new to try, and for whatever you have a taste for. Food comes out fast and they even have prepared cold cuts in the cooler if you're in a real hurry. Bakery and desserts too and all kinds of drinks. 

The sandwiches are always fresh and delicious and the soups are rich and hearty. They have a huge selection of bottled sodas and a little brewery right out back to make their own beer, -- which from what I've been told has always been great by the way. The staff is very helpful and efficient. Always courteous."}
{"text":"This is a great local deli, with an impressive  beer and wine selection for it's size. I've stopped in a few times and everything I've ordered has been great."}
{"text":"Road tripping Mom by herself looking for an authentic deli experience and found it at Lehman's.   Loved that I could get a 1/2 sandwich, the New Yorker brought me back to my Jersey days.  Cucumber salad on the side was great too.  Friendly staff, nothing to complain about!  Its a long way from home in Seattle to this place but if I find myself in the area again I will make sure I get back!  I'd love to try more on the menu because everything looks great."}
{"text":"Very nice people and pretty good lunch food.  But, the operations of the place are just horrible.  They need to hire an efficiency consultant to show them how to process customers faster & better.  At lunch, there is always a mass of people in each other's way because they have such a kludgy order/wait/pay process."}
{"text":"So much better than fast food. Go to lunches, so yummy. I love their soups, sandwiches, salads, you can't go wrong. I love their ruebens, subs and other deli sandwiches. They also have a bunch of items in the cooler ready to eat like devilled eggs, deserts and pickles. Call your order in and it will be ready when you get there. Only problem is there is a crazy line for pick up orders during lunch and there isn't much of a system in place. Not best value in the city (they tend to be a little stingy with the meat) but they are still worth a visit every now and again."}
{"text":"Great soups, sandwiches, and subs. Make it over here often for lunch and have never been disappointed. Can be a little slow when it's busy."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk into Lehman's Deli, you may not immediately expect to be blown away by anything in particular. But just notice the customers waiting in line in front of you, behind you, beside you - there's a reason why people are willing to stand patiently in a small cramped space. One bite of the Pastrami Rueben Sub or the Philly Cheese Steak, and you'll know why. 

This place knows their meats. Any sandwich or sub off of the \"Hot Sandwiches\" or \"Philly cheese\" section of the menu is a delicious and perfect combination of bread, tender meat, and melted cheese. When you walk in, order first at the meats counter right in front of you, then when they complete your order and call it out, pay for your meal at the side counter on the left. In the meantime, feel free to peruse the sides, appetizers, and snacks all around you. I personally recommend one of the blueberry Bai drinks in the fridge. Tart flavor, but not overly sweet, and won't spike your glucose levels - great pairing with a savory sandwich from Lehman's deli!"}
{"text":"Not as good as what all the locals say. Very over priced. Cramped inside and the kitchen looks gross. Wouldn't go back even for a free meal."}
{"text":"First trip to Lehman's and I can say is WOW ! Corned beef - 10 , Pasta salad -10 and service was friendly & quick ! Way to go !!! I love love to visit places that are family owned . I will be back folks !"}
{"text":"it's carry out at it's best.  Friendly service.  Yummy options.  2 picnic tables outside to enjoy your food.  They sell beer and wine, good selection.
If you haven't been,  check it out !"}
{"text":"Amy B basically summed it for me.  This place is great and I try to go here for lunch at least once a week.  Great homemade Soups, Awesome Chicken Salad, Awesome Patty Melt and they make a mean philly cheesesteak, and yes its better than that Penn-Whatever Chain.  

Plus, they make thier own Roast Beef and Corn Beef.  Oh and I forgot about thier homemade cookies, which are also great.  They will also make any sandwich, a half sandwich if requested.  

Good Stuff!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Their sandwiches and everything they serve is freshly made, delicious, reasonably priced and promptly given to you.  They usually have a monthly menu that can be found on-line and it shows what their specials are each day.  I love this place because it's a locally owned non-chain that provides wonderful food--nothing fancy, just plain, good and nutritious and great tasting items.  They also make great hamburgers, and quickly, too.  They always have enough staff to prep orders quickly.  They do a fantastic lunch business from what I've observed and I know why.  The food is really good, it's priced reasonably and it is consistently very tasty.  This place is head and shoulders above any chain I've been to.  It's a take out place so although you cannot eat there, it's worth making a quick stop to pick up lunch or dinner.  They have various specials throughout the week, such as chili, soups, spaghetti, mac and cheese and all sorts of sides.  Their subs are fantastic.  These people know what they're doing in the keeping people's stomach's satisfied and happy.  I love this place--wait, did I say that already?  If so, it's worth repeating."}
{"text":"Lehmans is great when you are pressed for time and don't want to go through the drive through! good homemade food fast! they have several options for soups and sandwiches and salads on a daily basis. one thing i always liked was they have salads and snacks such as cucumber salad and fruit cups already prepared in the cooler for you to grab and go. they have a menu on line and you can order on line as well so it can be ready when you get there! the cool part about this place is its also like a little convenience store with pop chips and cigs when your in a hurry. The charm about it is the Amish jams, butters and syrups you can buy locally without having to go to Amish country! around different holidays they do homemade goodies for the occasion. pumpkin cookies in the fall and coal, reindeer poop and funny stuff for the kids around Xmas for their stockings! only downfall you cant sit and eat, but like i said great for when your in a hurry!"}
{"text":"fantastic food and selection

definitely overpriced though and i love the place but man 14$ hurts for a sandwich and large soup w soda.... give us a break guys please...."}
{"text":"This place first won me over when I was ten and I used to bike up to buy New York Zeltzer Seltzer Cream Soda. The same family is still running it twenty years later and they are just as nice now as they were then. 

They have lots of made to order sandwiches (hot and cold), soups, chips, ice cream, you name it. Great drink selection and an evil little collection of HOMEMADE cookies and individual slices of cakes and cobblers by the register. They cater too (deli trays, shrimp platters, etc.) The food isn't fancy or especially creative, but they make a darn good breakfast sandwich and really anything else made on the griddle.  It's a great place to grab a sandwich on the go. You'll get a smile with your order too!"}
{"text":"I don't know what else you expect for an awesome local place.   All of their food has been cooked/prepared to order and doesn't leave you wanting for more.   The paprikash soup got my wife through pregnancy.   I live on the tuna salad sandwiches.   They support local businesses and sell their wares too.  Love Chrissy's Popcorn too!   Don't forget a parfait or cheese cup to go with your order and wash it down with their homemade iced tea.    Hot or cold you can find something for all tastes"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Word of mouth and local recommendations were the impetus behind selection. 

Packed and very busy, but efficient and delicious. 

Called in a large order for pick-up that was executed flawlessly. 

First visit, but not the last..."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast too!  I love their breakfast sandwiches, but you might not be hungry for the rest of the day!   They have great sandwiches, soups and salads.   The desserts are great too, and they display them on the counter, so it's hard to resist!  

They have online ordering which has always worked without a hitch, or you can call in an order or order in the store! 

They have a small selection of wines and craft beers & housemade sodas and a good selection of juices too."}
{"text":"After R&R Hall of Fame ...
Fast fresh food!
Pastrami Ruben for hubby ... he gave it 5 stars. 
Seafood pita 4 me ... 5 stars.
Easy to get to with Yelp directions."}
{"text":"Grabbed some Reubens for St. Patty's Day...they weren't bad, but I had enjoyed a Slyman's Reuben for lunch, and, well, there is no comparison.  The corned beef was not thinly sliced/shaved, so it was a bit chewy.  Not offensive, but not worth coming back for, either.  The menu is pretty big, so we might check them out again (and have something else)."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome.  I got the turkey club sub and an order of fries and the total was like $11.25, $2.75 for an order of fries?  That would be my only complaint, is that it's kind of pricey.  Won't stop me from going back again though.  I devoured that sandwich and the fries are also made to order - double battered.  Good stuff"}
{"text":"So I've been to Lehman's deli about 4 or 5 times now and yes the food is good but the attitude of the staff is just terrible. It's like a small mom and pop store without any of the charm which makes those places unique. The overall tone is that you are inconveniencing them by being there. 
    The last time I brought 2 other friends with me one of them asked if they could recommend anything. The response... \"No\".  I don't think the food is that good to put up with the crusty exterior especially at the prices they charge. I'm not saying that I will never go back but it won't be as frequent as it could be based on how close it is to work.    
    Just don't go into this place expecting friendly dialogue or ask any questions and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"I used to work in Westlake and now I miss having a quick go-to place like Lehman's when I forget to pack my lunch. The store is teeny tiny and fills up fast during the lunch rush with locals from surrounding businesses, however they offer quite a selection of chips, snacks, beverages, sandwiches and soups. 

Lehman's was great to stop into on a cold winter day for a hot bowl of hearty soup (Italian Wedding and Gumbo were two of my favorites), a toasty grilled cheese sandwich and a Jones soda. They also have a monthly calendar of lunch specials that you could usually find on their website. 

The downside is that they are more expensive than some of the other deli style places around Westlake - but I was paying for convenience so I dealt with it. It was still much cheaper than what you would pay for a soup or sandwich at Panera!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years.  Food is great but the store has become more crowded and less organized when waiting for food.  Other than that, will repeat.  Great selection of fresh sandwiches, chicken, soups and salads."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. They don't have a dining area but there are two picnic tables outside that you can go eat on. All their food is great and made in front of you. You can also call in an order so it's ready by the time you get there. Their breakfast sammich is the bomb!!! Sausage egg and cheese. They actually use real eggs, not that fake stuff. They crack them right in front of you!There are a few coolers in there when you walk in. There's pop, beer, juices, and home made tea! Yes, homemade. That's my favorite tea on the planet. Also have Lehman's sodas! They have lunch size portions of cheese, veggies, pasta salads, fruit cups in the coolers. There is also chip stands as well as sweets for those that have a sweet tooth. Those are also home made (try their cookies). They have a deli so deli sandwiches are great. Turkey on wheat is my go to! Subs are amazing as well. Their jalapeño poppers are cheddar cheese filled, not cream cheese. Oh, they also make chicken papeikash! They have daily specials so check those out. Chicken philly, tuna melt, meatball, philly cheese are amazing! All great choices. They also have burgers. If you have a party to throw and need a deli tray, order from here. Always fresh and great options!"}
{"text":"My favorite deli and I'm so grateful it's just down the street from work! You can't go wrong with one of their daily specials, soups, salads or sides. It's also a hidden gem for craft beer, selling Great Lakes, Dechutes, Arcadia, Griffin Ciders, Elevator, etc...I've even spotted Costa Rica'a Imperial. They also have a good wine selection for those who prefer that. Can't go wrong with Lehman's! Stop on in!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You can't go wrong with anything off of their menu. And the employees are always so nice. It can get crazy for lunch so its always a good idea to call ahead. My dad is obsessed with their breakfast sandwiches! They even let me customize it with egg whites and grilles onions n green peppers. The top favorites for my family is any of their breakfast sandwiches, their burgers, the walleye subs, their reubens, and their roast beef sandwiches are the closest to my hometown of Buffalos Beef on Weck sandwich I've been able 2 find in OH"}
{"text":"Best homemade breakfast sandwich I have had in a while. The entire sandwich was made to order and it tasted grrrreat."}
{"text":"I love this place because they have fresh veggies and fresh soups/sandwiches. I like that they also have a cool little wine collection and homemade syrups/jams. They also serve my favorite van Roy coffee."}
{"text":"Will not return. I visit relatives in the area a few times a year and like to try out places I've never been.  Lehman's has a good reputation on Yelp and the menu looked great.  I went for a late lunch today.  I got egg salad on Italian bread, macaroni salad, and a small pepperoni and cheese cup. My lunch date got a turkey Ruben on rye,  cucumber soup, and coleslaw. Outside of my bread and too much mayo in the macaroni salad, everything tasted good. However, within 20 minutes we were both suffering gastrointestinal issues. I suspect food poisoning. Can't prove it. But I will not go back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch and both times the food was excellent. I don't think it's pricey as others have said for the quality you receive. I'm especially pleased with the fruit cups a lot of places just give you melon and there was a nice variety of fresh fruit. There is a very large selection of items on their menu and in the cooler in store. If you are in the area I would definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place. Granted it's not an eat-in style restaurant, so don't come here if you're looking for atmosphere and somewhere cool to eat. Come here if you're hungry, want good food and intend to eat at home. I'm not sure what their fries are battered in, but whatever it is, it's addicting and down right TASTEFUL. I've had plenty of things from here including their mac & cheese, soups, burgers, etc. but their burgers & fries are by far the best. This is a local gem."}
{"text":"Huge selection of sandwiches and soups! Staff is super friendly and helpful. Love this place in the summer with the picnic tables outside!"}
{"text":"I love love Lehman's! Can't get a better lunch around Westlake for the price. Everything I have ever had here I have liked.  You can get anything you're craving! Love the staff, always friendly and appreciative of your business even when they're slammed."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the strength of the reviews and we were not disappointed. The pre-prepared foods/salads were great. My husband ordered a crispy chicken pita, which was tasty if uninspired with shredded iceberg, tomatoes, and honey mustard. 

It's also right off highway 90, which is very convenient as a road trip stop."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab lunch!!!  I work down the street and have Lehman's deli at least once a week.  Fresh Soups and Sandwiches at a fair price.  The staff is very nice as well.  They not only have lunch but plenty of snacks and beer.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ways great options.  Made fresh and a real deli feel.  Has great drink options and homemade desserts.  Great place for a great sandwich platter to hit the spot."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've had everything here and I love it all! My least fav choice tho, is the bologna po boy."}
