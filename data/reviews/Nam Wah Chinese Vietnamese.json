{"text":"David, the new owner, has transformed this restaurant! 
Give it a try again. Food is great, prices right and David is very charming. 
The old reviews, before May 2014 should be removed by YELP or at least ignored by everyone."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We had the Singapore noodles, pho tai wam, sesame chicken and pork super bowl noodle bowl. The waiter was so nice and helped us pick out some great entrees. Great food and excellent service! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Jason and David are awesome! This place is great and definitely worth a try. Please support these local guys...food and service both top notch!"}
{"text":"My husband & I  stumble to this awesome asian Vietnamese/Chinese cuisine. Food was delicious, staff was really friendly, & price was very reasonable. Def. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Yum! Awesome place that wasn't crowded or overpriced. The food is just like eating at home! I had the Pho and spring rolls!"}
{"text":"This place has, hands down, the best pho king pho in the area.  I can't wait to go back and eat it again! 

I'm also a big fan of their Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"O-M-G!! I am so in love with this place. I live out in Lorain and I will take the 45 minute drive just to have the bang mi. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent (we had both the Chinese and the Vietnamese )!  

The staff is friendly and helpful. The new owners have done an incredible job. The restaurant is updated and fresh.  They have all the original Chinese dishes as well as the new Vietnamese dishes. All are yummy, freshly prepared and nicely presented. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Get your Banh Mi and Pho HERE! Both are great and have authentic taste. The variety for each is also amazing. Guess what, the fish sauce is also super tasty (the best I have had) and homemade. Service was great and the server knew we came for the real Vietnamese food and made sure we were happy with everything. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant is fairly big and it looks like they do weddings and larger events. They also had a bar. I would recommend you go elsewhere for your run of the mill Chinese American food, as this is not what this place is about. If you want some of the best Pho and Banh Mi in CLE, come here."}
{"text":"Finally found a great place in the SW Suburbs for my Pho fix. Very friendly staff that shared a couple of secrets for how they make such a great bowl as soon as they open for lunch.  Have not tried any of the Chinese on the menu, so can't comment on it, but the vietnamese is as good as anywhere."}
{"text":"Simply the best Asian food I have had.  I love the selections and when I want something different, ask David for a recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellent pho. Rich broth. Delicious flavor. Definitely worth the trip from the east side on a cold winter day. Great service from an entrepreneur who earns your business."}
{"text":"We have lived in Berea for many years and never cared for Nam Wah, in fact it was awful. Since it has been under new management, we have been there 2 or 3 times a week for lunch or dinner.  I have had everything on the Vietnamese menu and have loved ever meal. So many different soups to choose from and the Buhn Mi sandwich is amazing. The Super bowl is a must try, with rice noodles, and choice of meat and a spring roll.  It's definitely one of my favorites. I am sure the Chinese menu is great but I can't get past the awesome Vietnamese menu. The service is great and the restaurant is very clean, which was a problem with the prior management. If you are anywhere near Berea, this is a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Great depth of spices and her nice helpful wait staff....can't drive past this one, and the pho.....oh ya!!!"}
{"text":"Pork marinated summer rolls were very good, sauce tremendous.  Hot & sour soup was ok.  Meal was average overall."}
{"text":"Looking for Chinese/Vietnamese, heard about Nam Wah.  Visited tonight with family, was greeted by David as we walked in.  Seated at a table in back, near to the renovated bar with 3 big screen TV's (husband wanted to watch Saturday football games).  We ordered Pho, Szechwan pork, and I ordered Vietnamese platter (can't remember name).  All were very good, I really liked mine it had a marinated pork chop and lots of little tastes of other items all of which were delicious.  Under new management, David and staff (very helpful) are reworking the menu to include new Vietnamese items as well as some of the Chinese classics.  Looking forward to our next visit and seeing what the final menu looks like."}
{"text":"Save yourselves.  Oh lord, this was the most disasterous outting with the family that I believe I ever had.  Food was bland, tasted old, presentation was terrible, restaurant was filthy and the wait staff less than stellar.  Looked forward to some nice oriental cuisine and left with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Every now and then I enjoy going out to eat for Chinese/Vietnamese food, and Nam Wah is becoming a favorite. If it was closer to home I would order my take out from here as well. Food is delicious and service is great, everyone is very friendly and always checking back. The crab Rangoon is the best! Not sure how they do it, but it's 90% less greasy then any other place I have ordered it, must try!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the restrooms. Extremely dirty. Learned long ago that if this area is not kept clean the kitchen is likely to be the same. My bah me was good. But my wife ordered egg rolls. These were the same as the microwave ones from the grocery. Fried rice was below par. The sweet & sour sauce was just sweet and it was thickening from being too old. Vietnam food very good but Chinese food was mediocre. All the customers were younger men. No women. No lunch rush. If desperate for Vietnamese food stop otherwise eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years (lunchtime) and the restaurant recently changed hands.  The new owners seem to be focusing more on the Vietnamese side of their menu and boy does it show!  The Chinese side of the menu is pretty good (always a fan of their General Tso's chicken), but the emphasis on the Vietnamese cuisine is where they really shine now.

On this recent trip I tried bot a Banh Mi sandwich and a specialty dish, the Bo Luc Lac. The Banh Mi sandwich was served on a perfect roll that was moist on the inside and firm on the outside.  The grilled pork mixed perfectly with the fresh veggies making for an excellent start to the meal.

On to the main dish!  The Bo Luc Lac is a plate filled high with tender beef served with more fresh vegetables and fried rice.  This was some of the most tender meat I've ever had, very lean and flavorful...they must have marinated the heck out of it, it was so delicious!  The marinade / sauce was unique...not really teriyaki but something close...it was light and not syrupy.  The fresh veggies and fried rice were a perfect accompaniment to the meal.

I will be back, now that I've discovered this great side of an \"old friend\"."}
{"text":"If you go here for Chinese for you're seriously missing out. The Vietnamese food options here are the best. I still can't believe I don't have to drive to Cleveland for good Vietnamese food! Can't say much about the pho (only tried it once), but highly recommend going for a com tam (broken rice) dish. The com tam thit nuong is excellent"}
{"text":"Got a takeout there the other night after several years away. Heard good things online and things looked promising from the menu and the restaurant -- much improved from what I remembered.

Really disappointed with the food -- we got some various tofu dishes which were almost wholly celery, onions, and pepper. Weak! No flavor. Hot sour soup had no \"kick\" to it. Just mediocre stuff. Prices reasonable at least."}
{"text":"I am puzzled that the place was almost empty last night (Saturday) during the dinner hour, given their excellent reputation. Also, although my dinner mates liked their selections, my chicken lo mein was very bland. Even a liberal application of salt didn't rescue it. But I will be back, to order the Pho, which I've never tried before."}
{"text":"The restaurant is tucked away in a small plaza so many people might miss it. The staff is helpful and friendly. I've eaten here twice and recommend getting something off of the Vietnamese menu instead of the Chinese menu. It's more authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Vietnamese restaurant. Our waitress was delightful and super helpful when it came to making decisions. The beef sticks and the Pho were amazing, and the spicy mustard sauce had an incredible kick. Plus, everything was super affordable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is great! Food is delicious! I ordered steamed pot stickers as an appetizer and they were awesome! For my entree, I ordered the flank steak and brisket pho and it was awesome! I didn't notice bubble tea on the menu so if they don't already have that they should add that to their menu! I definitely will be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.

It had been about 5 or 6 years since we last ate at Nam Wah and what a difference new ownership has made. Today we got take out, and it was fantastic. 

My wife and I had the pho with meatballs, shrimp and pork summer rolls, pork lo mein, and lunch combo with General Tso's. 

The pho was out of this world good. Fresh add ins included, along with sauces. Broth was outstanding, and meatballs were delicious. Ditto for the summer rolls - large, fresh and tasty. Wife's Gen Tso's was cooked perfectly and had both white and dark meat. The pork in the Lo mein was actually really tender, instead of crispy/chewy, and very well done.

Overall, will definitely be eating in or taking out from there again - I can almost smell the fragrant pho already."}
{"text":"tried Nam Wah for dinner on Saturday night and we enjoyed it. 

Neither of us had ever had Vietnamese food and to be honest, we really didn't last night either. Well, except for the pork and shrimp summer rolls (Goi Cuon) i bought as an appetizer and it was very good. 

We also shared some crab rangoon (as we do). Danielle had the chicken chow mein and I had Szechuan beef w/ a cup of wonton soup. the soup was delicious and thinking of it now makes me want some more. the crab rangoon was some of the best i've had. i was surprised at how non-greasy it was compared to anywhere else i've gotten it. 

Danielle enjoyed her CCM and I thought my Szechuan beef was very good but maybe a little sweet.

our service was good. Natalie checked in often to make sure we had all we needed. 

We're eager to return and try something new. I've always wanted a Banh Mi sandwich and a bowl of Pho so one or both of those is on the agenda next time."}
{"text":"A consistent favorite. Without a doubt one of the best Asian restaurants in the Cleveland area. I eat here on a regular basis. 

I recommend any of their Vietnamese soups. With the popularity of pho rising nationwide, you will be hard pressed to find a better bowl. A generous portion of perfect noodles, tasty meat, fresh garnish and fantastic broth. 

I also recommend their Banh Mi Sandwich. They come in a variety of flavors but I strongly recommend the beef and asking for an over easy egg on top. It is one of the best sandwiches you could ever have. 

I have tried a large chunk of their menu and have yet to have a bad thing. Add to that a great staff and service and you got a winning combination."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the new menu at Nam Wah! The Banh Mi sandwiches are mouth watering and so unique. Their signature Pho and other vietnamese soups have all been best I've ever had in northeast Ohio. Flavor is amazing and the portions make it truly an amazing value. David and his crew are super nice and willing to help you choose the right dish. I think I've had them all now! Lol. First time get the pho and a sandwich you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delightful it had been years since we had visited and we were very pleasantly surprised.
David our wait person was great he even explained a dish my wife experimented with and even our little granddaughter was pleased.
Prices are reasonable the restaurant is clean and bright"}
{"text":"Had to try the pho today and it was really good. Good flavors, very balance and nice size bowl to fill you up! 

Will definately come back to try all the other food!"}
{"text":"I have to travel to the Cleveland area often for work and this is the best Pho in Cleveland, period. On a cold snowy day (or a lunch after a late night out) it is the best."}
{"text":"Damn good food here. Went with the Szechwan beef. Phenomenal. You need to go here for some fantastic food. Excellent waitstaff. Like any other good Chinese Restraunt I have ever been to. Lacking a little bit in atmosphere but nails it with the food.  I have had the Kung pau chicken and the Szechwan need. Both fantastic. The Szechwan beef was ordered with medium hit and provided an excellent level of spice balanced with great taste. The meat was amazing and the vegetables are great. This is the second time I did not eat my celery. :-)."}
{"text":"Several to-go orders from here have convinced me write a review. Orange chicken, general Tso's and a vegetarian dish all were flavorful and huge servings for lunch and dinner. One person is usually at the reception and service is fast. Restaurant itself is always empty the times I have been at least and ambience us nothing to be attracted too. But taste of food beats all. Better for large groups as too much space here!"}
{"text":"I'm lovin' Nam Wah.  I hadn't been here in years and I can't recall why.  On a whim, my beau and I decided to try it a few months ago and we were pleasantly surprised.  

The old Nam Wah of years past is no longer.  They've done some updates so it isn't nearly so dark inside.  There is a decent sized bar and they have 3 large fancy flat-screen TVs for those of you who cannot dine without distraction.

This is a large space and if you want to do a big family gathering or party, this would be a great place to do it.  Maybe even an UYE!

The server (I think there are only 1-2 people who typically serve here) is always great and nice.  They're always accommodating if you need to make substitutions, which I appreciate.  

The Pho is pretty good!  I love that I can get good Pho in Berea and don't have to drive to Minh-anh if I don't have to.  My mom says the fried rice is delicious.  The eggrolls are pretty good too.  Typically Jason W yells at me because I don't post pictures, but honestly, the food arrives and it is so good I eat it quickly before I even think about taking a pic.

Good food, nice service.  It is a good place for take out or dine-in.  

Go check out Nam Wah!"}
{"text":"Nam Wah must translate to 'No Way'.  Wasn't flexible on changing sauce / meat around. I Wanted the red sauces but not breaded chicken so I asked to sub unbreaded w/ the Empress or sub red sauce in on a Hunan / Kung pao type of chicken dish.  No dice. 
Ordered cashew chick.  Too many bamboo chutes, celery and cashews (duh). So many bamboos.. that's All I tasted, even the sauce taste like it.  Shoulda got a different combo of veggies that I really like, as the wife did. Their veggie fried rice was outstanding.  Service was ok. Over charged item on our bill so had to get that fixed. Atmosphere was pretty drab / dark in there. 
Didn't quite warrant a 4 star."}
{"text":"Try the pho! Delicious. I had the chicken for take out. The broth was served separately, a container with the thin chicken, cooked noodles, cilantro, thinly sliced white onions and green onions. Then a separate Baggie with bean sprouts, jalapeño, line wedge, Thai basil, hoisin (which I didn't use) and Siracha.
Second time in had the Kung Pao chicken combo. Very yummy! I will definitely be back again since it's not far from the office."}
{"text":"Well, that was gross.

The orange chicken is chopped very small and because of that, it is almost inedible and hard. I chipped a tooth eating it. I'm serious. The sauce was very thin and sour. Yuck.

The house fried rice was standard, hence the two stars. Very overpriced though. You can easily go somewhere cheaper and get the exact same dish. 

Not impressed. Won't go back because I don't want the dental bill."}
{"text":"We wanted pho & didn't want to drive far so we decided to give this place a try. We had an Vietnamese appetizer, sandwich, & pho...it was all very good & fresh. The Vietnamese sandwich wasn't on the menu but the very pleasant waitress suggested it once she knew we were ordering pho. It sounded like they are incorporating more Vietnamese in their menu. The waitress was very interested in our feedback & kept coming back to make sure we liked everything. They have Chinese food too.

Their menus aren't up to date yet, apparently they are under new management & have remodeled. We will be going back often!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food! We had the goi cuon, cha gio, wonton soup, pho bo vien, com tam bi cha nuong, and the bun bo hue. All were authentic Vietnamese dishes that were true to their flavor and excellent in taste! If you order the bun bo hue, you can ask for \"nuoc mam/fish sauce\" to add flavor to your perfection! Everything else was and is perfect!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent lunch Pho tai and pork Banh mi with fried egg.Delicious food. Superior service..friendly..helpful and prompt. I am new with Vietnamese food.and will certainly be trying more. The Pho was large enough for 2 people especially if you are going to order other items. I am very impressed!"}
{"text":"The Vietnamese pork vermicelli bowel is bangin!  Killer bahn mi too.  They compare very well to superior pho, my usual joint.  I'll have to try the pho...if I can forget how delicious the other items are..."}
{"text":"me and my husband love this place. it's family owned and everyone is so nice. don't let the odd location throw you, it's amazing. they have the best pho in the Cleveland area. it even beats out superior pho. I also love the gene
ral tso chicken-ask for it spicy!"}
{"text":"Authentic, genuine pho to wash away my tears after being at the Browns gut wrenching loss on the blocked FG turned into touchdown - with no time. So after a night of drunken debauchery we came here.  I live in NJ - and came out for the MNF game ( don't ask me why) and this pho made up for years of pain and suffering as a Browns fan ( well atleast for a few minutes). Great, attentive service - fresh hot food, and you can tell it's the real deal. In Nj there's a ton of Vietnamese places and pho, and they're good - but they're a chain and this place has some kicking real good pho.  Come here, especially if you're a Browns fan.  It will stop some tears from rolling down your cheeks."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time. Very friendly and helpful staff. Try the Vietnamese dishes, you will not be disappointed!! I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Good stuff, bon mi and pho is very good. Decor and atmosphere not great but very good food. Service is very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews it was only natural we (my husband n I) wanted to check it out and fortunately we weren't disappointed at all. The place and ambience is simple, the food although is a different story - a fantastic one, if I may say. We started out with hot tea and loved every bit of it, needless to say it was consumed to the last drop. My husband ordered a Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef soup and he liked it (and that is saying something as he's usually difficult to please esp. soups cos he's usually very critical about them!). It wasn't as spicy as he would have liked it but it was still one of the best hue soups he's had. I ordered a combination platter of General Tso Chicken with veg. Fried rice and pork shrimp egg roll. I had asked the chicken to be spicy which it wasn't but that's forgivable owing to the overall lovely flavours. The food took a while to come and hence I'm giving just 4 stars. Overall it's a good place to eat Vietnamese fare and yes not that heavy on the pocket too,  it'll surely be on my list of regular visits."}
{"text":"Food tasted really good but I got the runs after eating this place. My aunt and I both had com tam dat biet and we are sure that the rice was not fresh. My uncle and cousins had pho and they were okay. I felt that the portion was smaller than other competitors. Server and staff seemed very chill."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times now and the soup is wonderful and the combination platters great too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Pho and incredible prices for a weekday lunch.  The atmosphere is a bit dated but the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty - not the best Vietnamese food in Cleveland, but good nonetheless. We enjoyed the bun, but it could have used more meat and veggies. The pho is ok but needs more flavor. The salt baked squid was delicious, but would be nice with more salad."}
{"text":"Such an amazing Banh Mi sandwich. Perfectly prepared. Pork was marinated to perfection. We also got the crab rangoon app and it was probably one of the best I have ever had. Server was attentive and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love the food and service! Best pho in Cleveland hands down! Singapore noodles, salt baked squid, bhan mi, and hot and sour soup are my favorites! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"For my husband's birthday, we decided to try Nam Wah because it is close by and I knew they had recently remodeled it. An excellent meal! We had a group of 8 and all of us enjoyed our meals. The special lo mein was really the best I ever remember having. We were very pleased with the service, too. Will definitely be returning. Give them a try."}
{"text":"The Pho was really good. Broth was very flavorful! If I'm ever in the area I will return!"}
{"text":"I have since returned to Nam Wah twice since my initial review. Tried the Pho, incredible; the Ban Mi, extraordinary; and Com Tam Dac Biet (grilled pork chop, shredded pork, and steamed omelet), best pork chop I have ever eaten. 

If you're not familiar with Vietnamese Cuisine, no worries. David will guide you in the direction you should go.  Try this place out."}
{"text":"Tried this place by chance and glad we did. The food was fantastic. From the pot stickers to the bahn mi to pho to honey garlic chicken... Basically everything we tried was delicious."}
{"text":"Walked in and left.  The place was filthy.  We needed a high chair for our little girl and when they brought it around there was no way I'd ever put my girl in that thing.  Menus, tables, everything was just greasy and gross.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time with my family as a kid. It wasn't very good, but Vietnamese options were limited back in the 90's. Now under new ownership, their food has improved a lot (focusing more on authentic food over Chinese takeout), and it's now one of the top dogs in the Land for Viet food in my book. 

I can't find anything I didn't like here. The salt and pepper squid. The bun Thit nuong. The goi cuon. The hu tieu. The pho might be my new favorite in Cleveland. No really, it is on point. Their banh mi was alright I guess.

Place is always clean. Service on point.

What else can I say? Nam Wah is my jam (Wah)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for amazing Pho and banh-mi look no further. Nam-wah has fast friendly service and you can not beat the great taste and authenticity or their food."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I love this place!  Would super love it if they had bubble tea though :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the special pho with all the beef parts (tendon, meatball,etc). The meatball was especially tasty. Pot of hot tea is only $1.50. 

My wife got the spicy beef bun no hue. It was absolutely delicious as well. 

Service was attentive and gracious. 

Wish we didn't have to drive all the way down to Berea for this great food but We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"We have made this a regular dinner spot. The hot and sour soup is by far the best I have ever had . Every dish we have tried has been totally different yet amazing flavors. If in the area this is a must !!"}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if it was available. 

No joke, hands down best pho I've had. 

Steak was great quality, some like the thin slices, these were thicker and juicier. 

Endless amounts of meatball. 

Soup was clean not all MSG like other places.

Too bad I live in NJ"}
{"text":"Just had the Vietnamese food and it was very good. I had the 5th pho on the menu and my husband and son each had
A bowl- super bowl and grilled chicken. We all enjoyed it. Service was good.
Prices were too. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and probably not going back.  Much better choices in downtown Cleveland.  First time here it was  a 3 1/2 stars because the food was good that time.  2nd time around we had similar items and a few new items, however it was not as good going down to 2 1/2 stars.   Now the last time I got a order to go and it took a while and the food wasn't good at all, as if they didn't care about my order at all.  That's enough for me not to go back."}
{"text":"Do not let the strip mall location the food and service at this hidden gem are nothing short of spectacular ! The prices vs quality and quantity of food are ridiculously low . We tried the chicken and pork bhan mi with egg on servers recommendation , the bread was perfectly toasty and chewy vegetables crisp and pickled to perfection and the meat no words ! In short everything it should be but elevated by the egg . The pho was easily the best we had in area I did the chicken and hubby tried some amazing shrimp pork rice and egg noodle concoction . We also sampled summer rolls which came with this yummy sauce and the cabbage chicken salad . This place is a must try !"}
{"text":"Coming from a place where there are a million and one options for Vietnamese or Chinese food I could be considered a bit of a snob.. I do my best not to get my hopes up for such cuisine in Ohio with limited competition, but this place had some good reviews so ya know... Unfortunately, that has no indication on the quality of food.. pho had measly pieces of flank. Order \"$1\" worth of tendon... got what would be considered the leftover scraps of tendon at any other place I consider a \"Vietnamese restaurant\". Beef broccoli was.... disgusting. Meat had a weird sour aftertaste... shall I expect food poisoning??
Any flavor probs came from overwhelming amounts of msg.. so sad, so sad.
Wish I could rate the staff separately... the server was very attentive and sweet... no fault of hers that the food tastes like ssshhhhhhhh"}
{"text":"I've had vietnamese food in numerous places (Dallas, Chicago, Portland, San Diego) and these guys top them all.  Definitely the best in the Cleveland area.

Their PHO is PHO real!  The broth is so good that it doesn't need the extra hoisin or sriracha.  

I get PHO everytime.  My two daughters love their PHO as well.  I've a couple of their chinese dishes which are good as well.

Appetizers are delicious as well.  The wings are nicely battered, fried and fresh if you get it.

Bahn Mi (pork sandwhich) here is really good as well.  

You can't go wrong with their food ... but I definitely recommend their Pho.

The service is great and so it the atmosphere.  It's family friendly and is a nice place for a date ... they even have a bar for sports spectators and chatty folks.

It's a family owned establishment that definitely serves quality foods with quality service.

I'd frequent this place as often as I can."}
{"text":"After taking a hike earlier in the day, a bowl of hot noodlesoup sounded like the perfect meal for dinner. We decided to checkout Nam Wah, since a lot of Yelpers in CLE seemed to give it great reviews. 

Nam Wah is located in a random plaza (no other Asian stores can be found). The decor of the restaurant itself is definitely dated, but at least it's quite spacious for big parties. 

We were seated right away, since it wasn't that busy. The servers were both very kind and attentive throughout the entire meal (if you are Asian, you know very well that attentive AND courteous servers in Asian restaurants is a rarity)! They checked up on us at least 4 times to see how things were or if we needed anything. Yay for kindness and good service! (5 stars for service)

Now the review for the food. I wanted to like the food so much, but was a bit disappointed with our meals. To start off we ordered the grilled pork spring rolls. The pork is marinated in a sweet BBQ sauce, and wrapped in rice paper with noodles, lettuce, mint, and other herbs. We enjoyed the pork rolls, so our meal seemed to have started off well. For noodlesoup we decided to try their Bun Bo Hue and Hu tieu. Now I just came back from trip to Vietnam, so maybe my review is a bit more critical having just had amazing Vietnamese food recently. The Bun Bo Hue was lacking in many aspects, no spicy flavors at all and the soup base tasted funky. Also, where is the taste of lemongrass?! The soup sort of tasted like something out of a jar, like those ready made soup bases. As for the Hu tieu, the dish was ok, the seafood was fairly fresh so no complaints about that. The only thing I would change about the dish was the chicken, which was a tad too dry. The broth was good, so at least we had one bowl of noodles we could enjoy. Overall, I think the food was ok."}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new management and are making lots of changes to the menu to incorporate those who are craving real authentic vietnamese cuisine in the Cleveland area. While visiting family here, lots of our friends and family keep raving about the new vietnamese dishes being offered at Nam Wah. We had to try it out...since my husband was craving noodle soup and I wasn't too hungry...this was the perfect choice. When my food came out it was extra flavorful and I couldn't stop eating! Mind you, I was not hungry. Not only did I eat my Banh Mi and Summer Roll, I also had a few bite of my husbands Hu Tieu. 

If you are tired of your normal Chinese takeout...try this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood pho and spring rolls. Seafood pho was delicious. Spring rolls were okay and a bit oily. Friendly and quick service. If your craving for vietnamese food, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Pho! I haven't eaten in, but have had their takeout and can't say enough about it. Their service is excellent and prices are great. I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I came last week. The food was absolutely out of this world! My fiancee got the curry chicken and I got a seafood platter and shrimp toast. Both were completely amazing. The flavor just kept coming and add their fish sauce and you couldn't possibly be disappointed. The only I'm not giving it five stars is because on a Friday night they had one waitress and she wasn't the best. He personality was amazing, but she needs some lessons on how to properly attend to her tables. That will however not stop us from coming here many more times."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Food was excellent too ! Go here to cure your Chinese food craving !"}
{"text":"Great classic Chinese and delicious Thai food. I recommend the Ban mi sandwiches and the general taos chicken. I also enjoyed the shrimp toast.  Go eat enjoy."}
{"text":"The pork chop was very good. The broken rice is a little bit too hard. Pho is good with good portion.  Overall I like the food here, will come again. I just hope they will turn on more light, a little bit dark in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant for Chinese food, pho and even the chicken curry. Ask for insanity if you like spicy. They typically do one drop for most, I got 4 yesterday in the curry and sweat like crazy. Bowls of pho are big as you'd hope and good, meat is tender and broth great. General Tsos chicken is crispy and probably the best I've had anywhere. We come every couple weeks it seems and have started bringing friends probably once a month. Great family owned/run restaurant.  Vietnamese coffee is sweet, but real good."}
{"text":"The dishes are not exceptional but decent 3 stars quality.   A bit bland for those looking for more flavor.

Waiter is excellent 5 stars

Wait time is long.  That's both waiting for seats and waiting for food.  Expect 45mins in total."}
{"text":"Recently moved back after nearly 20 years in  Chicago and have been hoping to find a place reminiscent of Ba Le for banh mi.  I came across an article that mentioned this place and finally checked it out - so glad I did!  Great banh mi!  I'll definitely be back (soon)!"}
{"text":"Service is great.  I ask for adjustments to the dish when I ordered, and they actually pay attention and honor your request.  The food is fantastic and the prices are good.  My favorite here is the Pho Tai."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing food, wonderful service, and great prices!  Started with the freshest fried wontons I've ever had.  Perfectly fried and tasty filling.  I've had pho all over North America and their broth was by far one of the very best I've ever had.  The meat was plentiful and flavorful. 

It is one of those places that I couldn't understand how we were able to get a table. The place should have been packed with a line waiting to get in. Instead it was just full and we were able to get a table quickly."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I had the chefs special Triple Delight with beef, shrimp, and scallops with a dark gravy, and it was very good! The meat was cooked just right and the vegetables were slightly crunchy just the way I like them. For $1, I upgraded to vegetable fried rice. Portion sizes were good. The spring rolls were delicious!! Well worth it, I will go back."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's probably my favorite Asian restaurant in this area. I usually order the Kung Pao chicken. The meal comes either alone or with a combo, which is a eggroll and rice. Fried rice and white rice (i believe) are the choices when it comes to rice.

The chicken was was very fresh and easy to bite into and was hot. Not dried out or lukewarm.   The dish could of been a little more spicy. 

The staff is nice and friendly. They give out samples of homemade sauces as well as your standard packet sauces and supply you with silverware if you ordered \"to go\".

They are closed in Monday which is unusual for most businesses."}
{"text":"As a first generation American in my Vietnamese family- the food here is ssooo authentic to the cuisine. You cannot be disappointed if you come here!! Awesome prices, killer flavors, and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great job taking this over and doing it better... Got a sub and the Pork chop combo and some spring rolls...."}
{"text":"I love this place. I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. I didn't have time to stay and eat but I picked up to go. The Pho is even great to go."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here when I was craving some pho beef soup.  Since Vietnamese was in the name of the restaurant, I assumed it'd be decent.  
It lacked the unique Pho flavor, and tasted more like a generic Chinese soup broth with Pho ingredients packed in.  
I should go back and maybe order a more traditional Chinese meal to give it a fair review, however the bubble gum pink walls might steer me away from dining in this establishment."}
{"text":"I don't live around this area but I had to run errands so I figured I tried a Pho place with good reviews on yelp. I'm so glad I did. This place located in a little plaza. It was a cold fall day and I was really craving for some vietnamese egg rolls and some really good pho. I have tried a couple of pho places but nothing that I extremely liked. Once arrived around lunch time the server seated us. They have a huge menu and its Chinese menu and as well as vietnamese menu. I ordered the Chinese egg rolls and also vietnamese egg rolls with meat to start with. The vietnamese egg rolls came out fresh and hot and so delicious. For my meal I ordered the flank steak pho but I also added chicken. So far of all the pho places I would say the broth the meat is the best I have had so far. They give you huge chunks of chicken which were delicious and the broth was so yummy. I would defiently come back even though I am pretty far."}
{"text":"I used to come here when I was very young and I remember the place being more fragile looking with low lighting. Now it seems to have evolved into a pretty cool modern sports bar with Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. The bar itself is big and open, and the bartender is always polite and helpful. My food was a Mongolian pancake with a stir fry-type filling that you added by hand and was absolutely delicious. It's definitely the most unique Asian dining experience in the area. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Try the bahn mi with egg!! The bread they use is the perfect mix of crispy and soft, it really was an amazing sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place!!!! The best Pho ive ever tried. Also a nice clean place to be in, and great staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's awesome to finally find good Vietnamese food locally without having to drive all the way to Asia Town. The food is legit. I have had all the Vietnamese noodle soups, and you truly can't go wrong with the Pho, Bun Bo Hue or the Hu Tieu Mi Dac Biet. The Com Tam Dac Biet is also as authentic as it gets. A lot of restaurants have cheapened out and no longer serve the steamed omelette, giving you a sunny side up egg instead (lazy!). I won't order it without a steamed omelette. The Banh Mi pork chop is also delicious (add the fried egg to put it over the top!). I know the cold Banh Mi is more traditional, but I haven't had a chance to try that yet.

I can't leave this place without ordering an entree there and ordering more to-go! I could eat here everyday if money grew on trees!"}
{"text":"Nestled in a strip mall behind a McDonalds they make some excellent food.  Its the closest place to home where I can get some Pho when I have a hankering for some.

Just left here for dinner.  I got the flank steak pho and it comes with all the fixings.  The broth is richly flavored, the rice noodles are plentiful, and there is a lot of steak as well.  For less than $10 for the bowl it's a great value.

The restaurant itself is old and looks like it was decorated 20+ years ago.  There are usually 1 or 2 waiting on the dining room.  They also check you out.  And take to-go orders.  So they are usually running around the place like crazy.  And it makes service very slow.

I look past the old decor and slow service for outstanding food.  That's the only thing that keeps me going back."}
{"text":"I love me some pho! When we have the kids it's a great place to eat. They have a large menu and anyone can find a favorite. The atmosphere is definitely family friendly. I would recommend this place any day."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I consider myself a Pho and Summer Roll snob. 

I visited this place years ago and said I'd never go back, but my craving for Pho took over today, and I went back. I'm so glad I did. I started with the summer roll, some call it the spring roll, I'm referring to the roll NOT deep fried, but in a fresh rice paper wrap. the roll was large, packed tight with fresh ingredients. Crisp and flavorful in every bite. What was more impressive was the peanut sauce that came with it. I've never tasted peanut sauce so deliciously flavorful. It caught me by surprise. Then came my Pho. It was served with your typical garnishments, and a few extra, and plenty of them. I feel I always have to ask for extra \"fixins\" but I did not have to there. It looked amazing. I tried the broth before adding one ounce of anything, my eyes popped out of my head, the Pho was amazing. It is tied for first as the best Pho I've ever had. If you're a pho snob, this place is worth the travel. 

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese restaurant on the West side of town.  The location is nothing special,  as it's located in a strip mall,  but the inside is clean,  spacious and nicely decorated. There is a long bar inside which is full service,  and on the Sunday brunch hour that I went,  the service was great at the bar.  They even had large tvs with the Browns game playing to boot.
They didn't have much in the way of beverage options.... No Asian fruit juices or smoothies but their menu is pretty expansive since they have both Vietnamese and American style Chinese dishes.  We went for the Vietnamese option and tried the grilled pork summer rolls (delicious and a very generous size!) as well as a bowl each of the pho and bun bo hue.  The soups broths are less complex that others I've had,  and I felt like the pho had that msg aftertaste but other than that they were fine.  Not my favorite in the Cleveland area,  but it would certainly satisfy my craving if I was in the Parma area
All in all given my first experience here,  it wouldn't be my first choice for Vietnamese but I'd certainly be interested to try some other stuff on their menu."}
