{"text":"I just tried Completo today after recently hearing about it. It's down a little side alley on the west side of Augusta at 214.   When you walk back there it's a little urban oasis. Tables with flowery table cloths, little vegetables growing in pots and very well-done graffiti!   Their current menu is very simple:  - Steak Sammy ($10) - Veg Sandwhich ($6) - Steak and Fried Eggs on Fries ($10)  The Steak Sammy was delicious- a bit spicy and fresh with mashed up avocado and diced up tomatoes. The Veg Sandwhich and the Steak and Fries both looked amazing too (while I looked onto other tables).  I highly recommend checking this place out!  They're only opened Thursday-Sunday 12-7 PM (Cash Only)  Their facebook is here too: https://www.facebook.com/completo.club"}
{"text":"Tried the veggie tacos for the first time and was better than expected.  I went with the veggie because as a meat eater, this would be a true test (I'm harder to please without the meat).   A few highlights: The toppings are all fresh and so flavourful Shells are not greasy or heavy yet sturdy and crunchy  The salsa is delightfully refreshing  The avocado helping is generous (a must) Good crunch overall (includes toppings) Nice portion (large enough to fill you up but not so big that it's going to stuff you Beautiful patio  Friendly owners ;) always a PLUS  Going to try the steak tacos tonight!  CHICKEN offering would give them a 5 star rating. Oh and the fries are so yummy. Crispy and Perfectly golden."}
{"text":"This is the place I always bring my friends if they're visiting me in my 'hood and we're looking for a bite to eat.  Cheap, unique, incredibly great tasting food - plus the guys who work here are always a hoot!  Totes recommended."}
{"text":"Unreal. Had steak sandwich and fries and it's  delicious. Homemade guacamole, fresh tomatoes, hot sauce ..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is amazing - have had a chorizo sandwich and tacos. My daughter had one of the boxes. All delicious.   My 4 year old mentioned that he was cold on the patio and an employee came running with a jacket to put over his shoulders while we ate. That was what really made me love this place."}
{"text":"This place has really great sandwiches. I've tried the steak, pork and the chorizo and it's really hard to pick a favorite because they are all different. The guacamole and the tomatoes they put in this sandwich are awesome. I think I'll wait till I'm hungover/drunk before I venture to eat the steak/egg/fries combo.  This is also great value for this neighborhood. The sandwich is $9 all in with taxes and everything is made fresh in front of you. A great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I've been on a taco bender lately. This place is great. I'll keep going back until people point and stare at me and ask if I have a taco addiction. I'll deny I have a problem. Inside though? I'll know I do."}
{"text":"Great flavours, casual vibe, and good prices.   The chorizo tacos are great. Salsa is always fresh. The chips are freshly made. I found the carne / steak a bit \"mystery meat\"-ish and probably wouldn't go for it again.  Great little patio area on the street. Takes cash only. Nice owner and staff"}
{"text":"Never would expect this place to have as good of food as it does. The veggie sandwich is the best thing on the menu, for meat eaters and all. Chips and guac were awesome too!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing why isn't everyone in this neighbourhood talking about this place! They have a ton of gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options. I had the hard shell vegan tacos and oh man was it amazing! Cash Only but that is the only draw back to this fantastic well priced place."}
{"text":"This is the perfect quick meal spot. Their boxes fulfill almost anyone's craving: French fries, steak and fried egg. Amazing!   I've tried the steak, chorizo and vegetarian black bean patty. The latter is my favorite and makes for a great and tasty protein option without the meat. It comes with homemade fresh salsa and hot sauce. Boxes I believe are $9 and more than enough for one meal. If I had more willpower I'd probably have leftovers, but it's too good!  If you're heading over make sure to have cash. There's no debit or credit available.   The only downside is that seating exists only in the summer since it's outdoors and towards the end of the summer the patio had several wasps flying around you and your food so you had to be careful.   Still I'll be back for takeout this winter for sure!"}
{"text":"I had visited Completo in their pop-up form in Kensington Market. Had the Steak/Eggs/Fries combo. Amazing.   Heard rumours about a year ago that they were setting up shop in Leslieville. Finally they have launched and I've checked them out twice. Can't really comment too much on the menu because both times I have gone back to the Steak/Eggs/Fires combo. Hopefully will branch out the next time I stop by. Both times the food didn't disappoint. Nice patio out front of the place which is on Coady just off Queen East. Great fast service. Now if they could just open a location on the Danforth.  Hear that you can now grab a drink at Hitch down the road and they deliver to the Bar. Great option."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time had the steak and egg box and second time had the chorizo box. Good value for 9 bucks including tax and both boxes were equally good."}
{"text":"Leslieville - Queen St E and Coady Ave  Completo in Leslieville can be found in the spaces that was once occupied by Le Martin.    I had one of their sandwich last weekend, and it was so good, I had to go back 3 more times... mainly  because my wife took a bite of my sandwich and didn't give it back., then my kids took my second sandwich before I even had a chance to try it.  It was their soft opening and there was only one sandwich and fries available.   They will have a full line of sandwiches the coming weeks.  My (third) sandwich had tasty thin slices of beef, piled on a perfectly paired bun, with avocado, tomato relish and a potent hot sauce.  The fries were irregular sized, some are shoestring and others are wedge like.  This created a mixture of texture which was an unexpected and welcome surprise.  Can't wait for their full menu."}
{"text":"Great spot.  I've eaten here a handful of times now and they don't disappoint.  The steak box is my staple, but they've just added a slew of items to the menu, taking the game to the next level... well played Completo.  I've posted the new complete menu in the photos.  Just finished a set of tacos.  Fantastic.  This is the sort of place that I love to find, fast, great tasting/quality food, very reasonably priced and served by a genuine staff.  Surrounded by a wasteland of restaurants serving up the same, over-priced steak frites dinner, Completo is a nice breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Summary: The Churrasco sandwich was the best sandwich I've ever had. I went for the first time on Sunday and cannot wait to go back again.   I can't even describe what was on the rest of the menu because one read of the description of the Churrasco had me sold and I didn't bother to look at anything else. Naturally-raised steak, tomatoes, avocado, mayo, red pepper sauce and Completo's home-made hot sauce, all served on a warm bun. As mouth-watering as it sounds! The steak was plentiful, the toasted bun was crispy and hot and the combination of the three sauces not only tasted heavenly, but didn't produce a soggy or messy texture at all.   At $9 (tax included!), the sandwich was a steal, and as filling, healthy and nutritionally balanced as it was good value.  The staff were amazing, very friendly and welcoming, and they truly made an effort to get to know me. Their friendliness was EXTRA appreciated when I got home and realised that I had actually sauntered into Completo and casually ordered a sandwich to eat-in just three minutes before they were due to close! I had no idea I had done this until I checked their hours online afterwards. Oops! The guys could not have been nicer and more welcoming if they tried even though they were probably secretly cursing my arrival, wanting to get home.  For those unfamiliar with this joint, there's a limited amount of indoor seating, so take-out is probably the best option for most. The inside however is more than comfortable if you choose to stay; it's clean and has a washroom. The only negative about Completo is that it's cash only, and there are no nearby ATMs that I am aware of. However, the fact that the tax is included in the pricing more than compensates for the cash-only inconvenience.   Highly recommended! (If you can find it - it's a few doors off Queen on Coady Avenue, close to Queen and Jones)"}
{"text":"Omg the pork tacos were amazing , good music and vibe. It is cash only so I went across the street to the convince store to take cash Out. I was served fast and the prices were great , highly recommend if you're in the area !!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!   So good!!  I inhaled their sandwich.  Avocados and fresh salsa on a sandwich is epic!!!"}
{"text":"I almost wished I was hung over.   it would be the only way to enjoy the food more. I had the pork and eggs over fries served in a box. the eggs served sunny side up sit a top the pork and fries like two jiggly yellow eyes looking adoringly at you. they drizzle down perfectly when you cut them. add in their hot sauce and pico de gallo and mix. the pork was chewy, but for $9 not a problem really.  also, homemade watermelon juice for $3 and friendly service make a perfect side kick for this meal."}
{"text":"Ordered their signature steak sandwich for $9 (taxes incl.) and while it was tasty and the ingredients fresh, the steak was quite sinewy and required a fair bit of chewing to get through. This is always a risk with steak and I was prepared for it, but it's also avoidable if you choose your cuts with care. Friendly service, but not super fast. I'll be heading back to try other menu items and will update this review if my opinion changes."}
{"text":"If you are in Leslieville and wondering where to go eat.... You gotta try this place!  I stopped by after checking out other Yelp reviews and it's all true.  Small hip joint where I tried the veggie burger.  Seriously, the best veggie burger I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I am vegan/vegetarian and was THRILLED to see a newish resto in the neighbourhood promoting vegan/vegetarian options!! They promote the idea that oil in fryer only used for fries, vegan mayo available, food options adjustable to meet veggie needs, etc.  Well, shocked and disappointed when I dropped in last week. I'm not sure about the requirements for a resto to claim such things BUT, here's what I watched (this is a VERY small space, so you can watch all that happens in the \"kitchen\" space adjoining the few seats about 2 feet away):  1. Food preparer repeatedly wiped the knife used to slice meat ON HIS PANTS, not on his apron, no cloth used, no washing (eeeewww!!!) before slicing a vegetarian grilled cheese.  2. Only one cooktop used for BOTH meat and grilled cheese. Also, they chuck the salsa onto said grill top to warm it up before adding it to whatever you've ordered, even if vegan/vegetarian (eeeewww!!!)  3. Same knife (see above) used to PREPARE salads, salsas, other vegan/vegetarian offerings. (eeeewww!!!)  SO: which would YOU prefer, if vegetarian/vegan?? Meat-juice knife WIPED on food preparer's pants before preparing YOUR presumably/avowed vegan/vegetarian meal OR meat-fat infused grill used to heat salsa?? Just CANNOT believe that no one else, in the past year, has noticed this! Beyond the vegan/vegetarian thingy, is ANY of this cross-contamination acceptable re: appropriate food prep??  I was a volunteer in a homeless shelter for a number of years recently; we had meat knives AND vegetable knives AND separate colour-coded cutting boards. Heaven help you if you were caught using a meat cutting board for vegetables or bread!! The chef would banish you from the kitchen! Why should a hipster resto have different requirements than those used to provide safe food to the homeless?? Great idea, lacking in basic hygiene, honesty and training."}
{"text":"De-li-cious tacos for $9 straight. Consistently very cheesy with juicy meat and great toppings.  Great fries and chips, too.   I'd suggest ordering ahead of time."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 5 stars for service.  Ordered a grilled cheese with chorizo, I ended up getting some additional toppings that I didn't ask for (refried beans and hot sauce). I spoke to the staff and he apologized and was happy  to make me a new sandwich. To make up for the inconvenience, he brought me a cup of watermelon juice for free. The sandwich itself was good. Also ordered the steak eggs on fries. Eggs on anything is good but I thought it was a bit bland tasting. Everything was made to order so it took a little longer than your typical fast food joint. Overall, it was a decent meal, would come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Tax is included in prices and I like it. I feel like I save money. I can eat a lot by $8 or $9. Foods are good. I tired Poutine and Tacos and both were very good. I will come back regular basis more."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches - grilled cheese filled with avocado and beans to die for. Very affordable prices and great cozy feel. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Completo is a hidden gem of Leslieville! The steak sandwich is out of control. I get it every time I'm in there. The employees are super nice, and they always deliver! Great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"complete meals at completo! what a nice twist/take on classic mexican fusion. came here on a rainy saturday with the wifey and kid bro and waited for 20 mins. hey i dont mind the wait if it make me salvate. the smells of this joint had me brimming with anticipation. the box!!! its all about the box!!! the tacos were good too but the box is what had it going on. i would have preferred my egg a bit more runny but i am sure i can request that next time. check it out! good comfort food and not too expensive as we got 2 sandwhiches, 1 order of tacos and 1 box for like $35"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing. The grilled cheese and steak makes sweet love to your mouth, where as the  boxes give a much needed pounding. Everything is filling a and perfectly cooked. The owner is a friendly guy who loves what he does. And the crowd who dines here is cool and nicely sociable, but not invasively so that you can't enjoy your meal. I recommend this to anyone with a mouth."}
{"text":"The food here is good. It's eat out only and cash only. There are picnic tables outside if you want to eat there. My husband loves the churasco sandwich ( I think that's what it's called) and gets it every time we go. I've never tried it, I usually get fries with toppings (they have a few topping combos on their fries). Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"OMG the food was awesome the first time, but the second time not so much!  My black bean patty was over done to the point of it being crumbly and the eggs were over done and the fries tasted like they were from last night fryer,"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The area is sorely lacking restaurants with vegan meals. However, Completo offers some fantastic vegan options. The vegan tacos are my favorite but the vegan sandwich is also great.  To people moaning about the seating and such, what did you expect when you walked in and saw the arrangement? To be whisked down some back hall to the lounge? As if. It's a great restaurant that makes the most of a small space. Not a place to expect to spend 2 hours chatting with friends over food when you can't sit on the patio, but a great place to get take-out if you work in the area."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 Environment 4.5/5  Great fresh Mexican food in this little corner shop! Searched Yelp when we're at Kew Beach for an afternoon scroll and hungry for some snacks. There's street parking along residential area, but you can tell that lots of locals and visitors stop by for a quick bite. The place is tight but service is quick and efficient. Everything is made fresh on the spot - you can see bowls of tomatoes, onions and limes scattered over different crooks and crannies.  Ordered tacos (comes in 3 - chose chorizo hot) and a house chips. It was the best mexican food I've had in a while, fresher and tastier than any I've been to uptown. The house corn chips are freshly fried. Comes with a cup of guac, cilantro yogurt dip, salsa and hot sauce. The hot sauce (maybe tomatillos?) was spicy but very flavourful - can't get enough of it! The tacos also had crispy freshly fried shells, and the chorizo sausauge is fresh ground beef pressed into little strips. Along with the refried beans, sour cream and all the fixings, every bite was bursting with flavour and super delicious.  Suggestion: have the fixings / dipping sauces in a paper dixie cup that can spread out for easier dunking of the chips.  Will definitely come back when I come by the beaches."}
{"text":"How have I never been to Completo before? Had the churrasco with chorizo sausage and ensalada with avocado sitting on the patio. Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome neighbourhood spot in Leslieville, it's a place where everybody knows your name.  When I walked in, I was warmly greeted and I proceeded to order their Chilean influenced tacos with pork.  It was filled with pork, avocados, tomatoes, and all the other ingredients you would expect to find in an authentic Chilean completo sandwich.  Each of the tacos was stuffed with ingredients.  Bonus points for staff who know a lot of the patrons who come in by name, and creates a sense of community.  Coady street should be proud to have Completo as its neighbour."}
{"text":"Small place, with a small menu.  That doesn't detract from the quality of the food.  The steak sandwich with cheese was perfectly cooked with tender tasty steak and a fresh soft bun that was perfectly toasted.  The hot sauce was flavorful with just enough kick to take the sandwich to the next level.  I recommend this place for anyone looking for a great, quick, lunch.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  One note for anyone visiting.  They don't accept cards yet so bring cash!"}
{"text":"First visit after being recommended by a friend. The name is deceiving because it's definitely not authetic Cuban sandwiches but it is very tasty for what it is. The pork sandwich was great. So go without any preconceived ideas and you'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The best 3 taco deal in Toronto. Hands down. I lived in LA for 15 years and have been in TO for 8 years and not only is their 3 taco deal the best price in the city...they are the best tasting and most food for the price. Cash only. Order ahead for take out, there isn't much seating."}
{"text":"Delicious pork sandwiches, good and cheap. As they cook it on the spot, definitely call ahead to put in your order so you don't end up standing around while you wait for it to be prepared."}
{"text":"We've gone there only twice but both times were amazing! Great service, friendly chatter and amazing food. Their taco shells are probably the best in the city, supper light not heavy and not oily at all. They are then packed with yummy goodness, along with an amazing homemade hot sauce yum!!!!! They dont serve chicken at the moment and the reason for it is so smart, they only have 1 grill and do not want to contaminate the other foods with the raw chicken juice. They had mentioned that they were trying to get a fish of some sorts in so beware its about to get even better. Its a fairly small sized place with only 2 foodbars to sit at and a small patio in the front to catch some rays on and eat, they only take cash so make sure to bring some or there is an ATM accross the street.  hope yu get a chance to try this place out it truly is great stuff!"}
{"text":"Cash only and mostly outside seating, not kept as clean as it could be BUT...  The food is amazing and the prices are great.  Not pretentious, cozy.  You can really tell the people working there put a lot of effort in.  I had the box with sausage.  Big layer of fries on the bottom, with a small amount of sausage and two sunny side up eggs, hot sauce and salsa.  Reminded me of being in Miami....I even got to sit outside on a warm, sunshine filled November 6th day!  The fries are on the greasy side, but delicious.  Sausage was tasty and had a bit of bite to it, but not enough of it!  Eggs were spot on.  A great experience, I will come again and try many more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Une très bonne adresse pour manger sur le pouce. Je vous conseille leur sandwich churasco qui mélange viande (buf, porc ou chorizo) avec de l'avocat et une sauce un peu relevée. C'est un régal ! Très peu de place à l'intérieur mais quelques tables à l'extérieur. Je le recommande vivement !"}
{"text":"This place is a really great lunch option for anyone in Leslieville. My friend Mike had a delicious veggie burger (one of the best I've tried) and I had the \"box\" with Chorizo. The Chorizo was nice and hot, the sauce served with it was fresh and the salad it came with was refreshing. The fries were delicious and the eggs that were on top tasted amazing. All in all a great combination. Highly recommended.  Some things to note: They're cash only as of this writing and the seating inside is very limited (8 people at the most)."}
{"text":"Good shit!   I tried the completo hot dog which tasted great but was overpriced...  Also had a nibble of my friend's steak box and let me tell you! It's better than the dog! The fries, eggs, and tender meat were all cooked just right... the holy trinity... (Good portion too.)  Worthy of my list!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food, Great little patio, reasonably priced.  I enjoyed the Steak Box. Homemade fries with steak topped with two eggs. Side of hot sauce and salsa.  Really great vibe in this place"}
{"text":"Now that all there friends got the their positive reviews out of the way, I think the truth will start to surface. This could very well be one of my worst experiences ever. Clearly I am not the demographic they are looking for and I am truly glad, I wont be back.  I had the steak and eggs box and I can sum it up in one word, gross. Nothing more needs to be said about the food.  The music was loud and annoying, no comfortable place to sit. The staff was polite, but not skilled in the food service or any service industry. The fries were good and freshly cooked, thank gawd something."}
{"text":"This guy is amazing I am from Mexico somehow this guy has managed to come up with the perfect taste of Mexico in those chorizo tacos!!! Will go back to taste the other stuff for sure! Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cash only here, this is a wonderful Mexican-ish place in Leslieville. Their menu offers up sandwiches, a salad, lots of cool french fry options, and tacos. We both had the house special sandwich, me with pork. Loved the sandwich. Fresh toasted crispy bun, great sauce, tender meat. Also had the Goat Fries, which were fries topped with goat cheese, tomatoes, onions, etc. Super yummy! It is not licensed. Has seating outside at picnic tables and other tables. GREAT spot for a summer lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a whim looking for something close by and tried the boxes.  We had both the steak and pork.  They were both decent and an interesting concept with eggs/meat/fries, but nothing that really blew me away.  It comes with a hot sauce and mild salsa on the side, but overall was fairly bland.  Kind of that that \"I already feel guilty eating this, but it wasn't quite worth it\" feel.  Their sandwiches look great though and there is some pretty good value here if you're hungry.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Chorizo sandwich was delectable. Friendly service and a nice community vibe that I could appreciate even though it was my first time there."}
{"text":"Amazing. Had the steak box fries and guacamole chips. Tiny space but will go back next time we are in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain is often quoted as being a devoted fan of \"meat in tube form\" and lauds the Chicago dog as being the pinnacle of hot dog achievement. Well, Mr Bourdain obviously hasn't had the masterpiece that is The Completo from, well... Completo.   I consider myself a connoisseur of the hot dog. I've lived in Detroit where I devoured countless coney dogs from Lafayette Coney Island... I've lived in Chicago where I spent endless days and nights sourcing the finest Chicago dog (Byron's Hot Dogs on Irving Park Rd, by the way)... If a hot dog is on the menu, trust me, it will be in my belly, toute-de-suite!   Nothing compares to The Completo. It's beyond any hot dog you've had. Order it and consider your quest for the \"Holy Grail of Hot Dogs\" over!"}
{"text":"Tasty AF.  Grab a box and go to the park and eat."}
{"text":"This place is SO good!  Fair prices for good food made by people who are proud of what they make.  What more can you ask for?  Some of the best fries in town."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak box.  It was pretty filling.  It has 2 sunny side up eggs, a fair portion of steak, and is loaded up with tons of fries.  Price of $9 includes tax already so it's a pretty cheap meal that will fill you up quick."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  If you are gluten-free like me and need a snackaroonie while walking around after a few drinks and don't have the options everyone else has because f***ing wheat explodes your gut then go here and have a delicious gluten-free grilled cheese for $5. You will not be disappointed, except if you have celiac's disease because I think they grill the bread on the same grill as the other breads. I have a moderate intolerance and don't have a reaction.   Only downside is it's cash-only, but why shouldn't you have $5 in your pocket?   Bonus: you can go to Hitch bar on Queen East and get order the food from Completo to accompany a delicious cider."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had the steak box and veggie burger and shared both with a friend. The flavours were delicious and the veggie budget was one of the best I've had.  Service was exceptional -  genuinely friendly and happy staff   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place was good.  Great place to grab a bite in the summer.  Food is tasty, quick,  and staff are great. Definitly will go again this summer.  They have outdoor seating,  and limited counter space inside."}
{"text":"Was in Leslieville doing some record shopping and was hungry, so I \"yelped\" some nearby restaurants -- and to my amazement, there were many Mexican restaurants around! After reading a few reviews, I decided to head over to Completo.  They have outside seating (which is awesome for the summer), but very limited indoor seating. While Completo is a smaller establishment and offers a very limited menu, I think they are doing a fantastic job! I, very rarely, eat Mexican food unless I am in Mexico, but Completo does a decent job! Their ingredients are fresh and the open kitchen allows customers to watch the chef at work!  Overall, I would definitely stop by this place if I was in the area -- but I would take it to-go and head outdoors to enjoy the food! Out of all the items purchased, I would order the tacos again!"}
{"text":"Many people rave about the place, but I didn't see the allure. I ordered a classic sandwich, steak, with cheese.  When I got it, there was no cheese on it, despite paying extra for it. So, I inquired about the missing cheese, and the cook acknowledged the mistake and asked if I still wanted cheese...the cheese was then added.  Before I left I decided to see if the sandwich was truly complete. To my surprise there was no Avacado/guacamole as in the description. So back I went to cash to inquire.  Again, the mistake was acknowledged and said topping presented itself.  I am not sure at this stage if it was a favor from the cook, or him being an ass, but he loaded the sandwich up with so much \"smashed\" Avacado as they advertise, that I could taste no meat...no bread...I'm left with a crappy $10 Avacado sandwich..."}
{"text":"Just went to completo for the 2nd time in 3 days and I can't say enough good things. Went there last Friday with my husband and we both got churrasco sandwiches with steak and split the \"poutine\". Everything was awesome and it was a lot of food. The \"poutine\" is huge.   I also suggested my vegetarian parents who were visiting this weekend go try it for lunch. They went there without me and both got the vegetarian sandwich which they said was one of the best veggie burger style sandwiches they've ever had.   Today I decided even though I just went there on Friday I wanted to go back for lunch. I got the churrasco with steak again and a small fries. It was just as good as Friday and they also offered to make me spicy mayo for my fries when I mentioned I use mayo for fries."}
{"text":"Super awesome. Fresh and really flavourful.  I've been here three times so far and I'll keep coming back.  Boxes are great with crisp fries to dip in sunny side up eggs, leave enough room for a bite if tender beef in the same bite. Wicked.   Also had the chorizo tacos. Tons of great flavour on a freshly fried corn tortilla.  I loved it, kids loved it, wife loved it."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon completo when walking in the neighbourhood.  My girlfriend is chilean and i have lived in Chile so i recognized the name. We were very excited to have the opportunity to have something to remind us of home and memories!  I had the veggie sandwiches which was a black-bean based burger and was garnished with great, fresh toppings.  I really liked the simple layout of the place and saw that summer time we could sit on there patio!   What really makes a good place great is the staff! They have amazing and friendly staff which made the experience one that we will remember.  The young gentleman had great enthusiasm talking about the place and fresh products.  I look forward to stopping by there again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch or a quick dinner.   It is simple and delicious.   My only complaint is that I wish they took credit or debit."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny Friday afternoon. Little space inside...mostly outside sitting...  I wonder what they do when it rains or snow?  Food was fresh and good. My kid ate a plain churrassco sandwich which was just  bun and meat, whereas my wife had it with everything on it...messy.  I had box with chorizo sausage which was good but maybe more meat less fries would have been nice.   will come back...but either take out or on a sunny day."}
{"text":"South American/Cuban inspired sandwiches to go.  I had eagerly awaited the opening of Completo in Leslieville. The owners told me it was 7 months in the making. The decor is simple, this place is all about the food. The two owners were both working and were very welcoming. I ordered two steak sandwiches and an order of fries. You could tell the fries were fresh cut and were quite good. The star of the show is the steak sandwich though. It was very fresh as everything is made right in front of you to order. The sandwich had a nice balance of spice with a very generous helping of guacamole to counter the heat from the chiles.   I am looking forward to trying out the empanadas next time."}
{"text":"My fiance had been talking about Completo's tacos for days and we finally had a chance to go here together.   The guy at the counter was super friendly and courteous. My fiance ordered the steak tacos and I ordered their fry box with chorizo sausage. Both were $9, tax in.   The tacos are only served on hard shells, which I found worked well with them. A generous portion of fillings and all the flavours of black beans, cheese, guacamole, beef, and everything in between worked well together.   My fry box was served with two sunny side up eggs that got all over the fries and made them super delicious. Cut in house, the fries were very tasty on their own, but made better by the house made pico de gallo and hot sauce included in the box. My only gripe is that there wasn't enough hot sauce for the amount of fries that was given. Near the end of my meal, I was eating plain fries because all the toppings and fixings were already gone.  All in all, a nice little place in the East End for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Cheap, filling and delicious. This place knows what a real tortilla chip and guac should taste like. The variety of salsas are also super delicious. Love the outside atmosphere. Must be tough for them to make it work in the winter though. I got the pork box,   \"A take-out box with a bottom layer of fresh-cut fries, a middle layer with one of the following thinly sliced and griddled meats: Then topped with 2 sunny-side-up eggs. Served with a tomato-cilantro salsa and house hot sauce on the side $9\"  PRETTY FREAKING SWEET."}
{"text":"A bite from our full experience review: \"This decisively unpretentious local Chilean spot captured our attention on multiple occasions when we jogged through the neighborhood.\" ps, their Churrasco sandwich is to die for!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and the smell of fries draws you in. Great staff and the owners are very involved and super friendly. I only wish they would take more than cash but definitely worth a trip to the atm."}
{"text":"I read about Completo a few weeks ago and had to head over to Kensington Market to find it.  It's at 214 Augusta, down a little alley and you can easily walk by without noticing it.  When you walk down the alley you enter a little backyard with some beautiful graffiti and plastic table & chairs.    I had the sirloin steak strip sammy and their fries.  The steak isn't a whole piece of meat, it's strips that are marinated then cooked on their flat top grill. It's served on a nice soft bun and topped with mashed avocado, chopped tomatoes and some spicy sauce.  This was an amazing sandwich.  The avocado worked really well in this, personally I would've liked this more spicy.  The fries were shoestring fries and just as delicious as the sandwich.  Perfectly salted and crispy.  I would definitely recommend this little 'blink-and-you-miss-it' sandwich joint."}
{"text":"WOW. I gotta say, I'm writing this review WHILE I'm on Completo's front door patio.  It's quietly nestled at the corner of Queen St. East and Coady Ave.  I am blown away at how bloody GOOD my steak and eggs box was.  For $9 (taxes in) it really hit the spot! I had a brief chat with Mattias (I think that's how you spell it) literally 5 minutes before writing this review telling him how much I enjoyed my meal.  From the service, amount of food you get (you get two fried eggs, some strip steak I think it was and a stupid amount of fries underneath), 'itis will definitely be something you'll need to battle.  It comes with a nice mild salsa and some hot sauce on the side that definitely has a kick, even if you're able to handle your heat.  Perfect for takeout or just chilling on their patio while you destroy any hanger you might be harbouring in one fell swoop.  This place definitely deserves a visit if you're in Leslieville."}
{"text":"So happy to have this little gem in the neighbourhood. Food cooked fresh in front of you. It's super casual, but small - as many other reviewers have noted - and nothing wrong with that! Perfect for a quick lunch to stay or to go. I've also heard they deliver food to Hitch (a bar a few doors East) if you get peckish after a few beers. Will be trying that service in the near future. It's places like this that make me love Leslieville!"}
{"text":"Everything is awesome.  I come here way too often. Sandwiches, tacos, boxes, chips/salsa, you can't go wrong with anything! Super friendly guys, take-out or small dine-in area only - go now! You'll soon be addicted."}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite, but limited space inside (only two bars), they have tables outside though.   Tried: Steak&eggs with fries and taco box  LOTS of fries underneath two fried eggs and steak, with a small amount of salsa made fresh at the place. Steak was very tender and well seasoned which was the highlight of the food. Other components of the item can't really go that wrong anyway. Tacos were nice and packed with fillings inside.   People say the staff here are really nice and friendly...I found them just normal. They were not rude or cold, but average service.   Overall, generous portions, cheap, OK food (nothing special)."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite tacos in Leslieville. Very consistent quality. Pork is top notch. Hitch fries also incredible.   Prices are tax in. Cash only. Quick service for takeout or eat in."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a yummy sandwich with fries!  Had the beef sandwich.  Very tasty with a crusty bun.  Thin crispy handcut fries were fantastic.  Looking forward to having poutine on my next visit!  Outdoor seating so plan for take out if it's cool outside.  And bring some cash.  No cards accepted."}
{"text":"My favourite place for a vegetarian meal, and I'm not even a vegetarian. The Black Bean burger is absolutely incredible. Can't rave enough about this place. Very cool vibe and amazing service, combined with delicious food."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for hole in the wall places where I can score some delicious food. Fantastic, flavorful food at reasonable prices is hard to find nowadays; but if you're in Leslieville, you need to count your blessings because Completo has got you covered. Their prices are cheap especially when you realize the tax is already included.  OUR ORDER: - Steak tacos - Comes in a box of three, stuffed with refried beans, mashed avocado, tomato-cilantro salsa, cheddar cheese, cilantro-lime crema, and house hot sauce. Crunchy shells with savoury filling DELISH! - Loaded grilled cheese which comes with mayo, diced tomatoes, mashed avocado, house hot sauce and roasted red pepper sauce. I added Chorizo (you can add protein to their grilled cheese, sandwiches or salad for $4 extra). Shout out to Jessica N for thinking of this. MAN! This was one tasty sammich: ooey, gooey cheese and spicy chorizo are a match made in heaven :-9 -In house made tortilla chips served with tasty mashed avocado, tomato-cilantro salsa, cilantro-lime crema and their house hot sauce. My only complaint was some of the chips had middles that were not crunchy.  During the cold months only two skinny bar tables with tiny butt stools to eat your food, suggest NOT coming during peak hours unless you want to wait out in the cold for your order. During the warm months there are a number of small square tables and two picnic tables outside under a tree to enjoy your food. Free neighborhood parking, check signs for time restrictions."}
{"text":"It's a very small place off Queen St E in Leslieville. Nice patio. The Chilean Churrascos are the best. Very tasty thin slice beef, nice toasted bread, good avocado."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and affordable.  They always use fresh ingredients and the flavours and taste are always on point.  The steak box is by far one of the greatest hidden gems in Leslieville for the price. Fresh hand cut fries, fried eggs and steak all wrapped up in a neat little box.  The box also comes with their own homemade salsa and hot sauce for a little extra kick.  I've seen other customers order the tacos and they look amazing as well, will definitely be trying those on my next visit.  The only drawback if any is that because it's a small kitchen, wait times can be a bit long during the lunch rush. But, if you're not in a big rush the food is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've eaten many tacos in my lifetime but didn't realize how good tacos are supposed to truly taste like until I had the pork tacos here!  I felt like a pig since every bite I took let out an involuntary moan from the wonderful flavors I was tasting.  Also had the chips and guacamole - it comes with crema, Pico de Gallo,  guacamole, and their house made pepper sauce (BOTTLE THAT UP PLS) with deep fried tortilla chips and it was the BEST guacamole I have ever tasted!!  We also had the fries with egg and steak and it was DELIGHTFUL!!! AMAZING fries on its own and with the egg and steak.  Wish they had multiple sizes for the food because it was so good it left me wanting more! A request, if I may... please make a huevos rancheros dish with your pork, eggs, fries, deep fried tortillas, guacamole, beans, pepper sauce, crema and pico... writing this post is making me drool so we will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while.  I actually dropped in to see if they had empanadas, but apparently they are no longer on the menu and haven't been for 7 months. I ordered 3 tacos, thinking that they could make them quickly.  I was wrong.  20 minutes later with a screaming baby, they finally came out.  The thing is there was no one in line before me, and I paid cash, so it's not like they were waiting for payment.  It was super slow.  I don't think it should take that long to make tacos.  Did I mention there was no one before me? Upon giving me my order the guy said \"good luck with that\" in reference to my screaming baby ~ who incidentally was screaming because we were waiting for so long.  Classy."}
{"text":"YAY!!! Finally made it to Completo...I love sandwiches! The best part of this is that they are opened late, so if you don't feel like cooking dinner or are working late, you can call to pick something up or get takeout before 9pm.  The space is small but even into the night, is brightly lit and bumpin with upbeat music. Their menu is simple, but still offer variety - three types of sandwiches, a variety of fries, and there are also tacos and grill cheese sandwiches.  I went with the Churrasco sandwich made w. Steak and the veggie sandwich. After a miscommunication (chorizo vs. Churrasco), they were very accommodating and gave me the steak that I had originally wanted to get. I appreciate them doing this because the chirizo was already on its way to being cooked.  I rapidly walked home to share my findings... We were starving and I was so excited. While I'm not usually big on \"bean\" burgers, this one was pretty good... You could taste the chickpeas in the patty and the toppings gave the whole sandwich so many flavour elements. The meat sandwich was sooo different in taste.. In a good way. I've never tasted a sandwich like this before... Unique and tasty! Especially loved that sprouts and avocado!  My one word of advice is that we both would have preferred the hot sauce to be spread evenly..... we both got a huge hit out of nowhere (hot sauce specifically on one side ) leaving our mouths uncomfortably hot.  Otherwise... See u for a box of fries next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick food pick up, especially for dinner when it's running late!   It's a tiny gem, in the small street right next to Queen East.   The food is super satisfying, super comforting and crave-worthy. It's the type of food that you want to eat after working out all day, or just because haha.   All the food comes in a takeout box which is very convenient to eat right outside or take it home with you.  For the summer, it can get pretty packed. Not sure how winter is, but I would to get me some comfort fries and eggs for those cold nights.  I totally recommend this place if you're in the neighbourhood!!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here. I've tried their sandwiches and fry boxes, both of which were good. But what I love the most are the tacos! Amazing tacos! I had the beef. Comes in a box of three for $8 and they are loaded with toppings. They aren't stingy with the guac and sauces either, which I hear they make both of in-house. If you like tacos, try them here. You won't regret it. I only wish they had more tacos to a box, I can probably eat ten of those in one sitting."}
{"text":"The food is so flavourful, albeit a bit messy."}
{"text":"Came here based off the good reviews for a quick take out dinner. Had the box with steak. It tasted great, I loved the place and the atmosphere. The two guys working were very nice and friendly, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"First time at Competo so I went with the classic steak churrassco on the top of the menu. Pleasantly surprise by the tenderness of the meat and the amount of fresh flavour packed into the toasted bun. Not use to having my sandwich buns toasted, but it does add a good amount of texture to each bite. The food choices of the neighbouring tables looked great also, with many patrons opting for the tacos or fries. Definitely will be back to try some of the other menu options.  The shop itself is a small space, with a tight kitchen and a single bar counter of sitting inside. If the weather is cooperating, there is a great patio space outside with some tables and couple picnic tables. Great sandwich shop for lunch on a sunny summer day."}
{"text":"Good place for comfort food.  Got the steaks and eggs over fries with hot sauce for $9 including tax.  Nice little patio on the front and you can bring drinks from outside."}
{"text":"Completo makes a fine addition to the hood with its short menu options and a great patio out front, just off Queen St on Coady Ave. Owner is friendly, engaging, and stayed open past closing for me and my guests on a Sunday. They also offer a take out option with Hitch, a bar down the street. Think breakfast-y food sans the bacon, which is a refreshing change. I've been going there once a week!"}
{"text":"I had the steak box.   The steak was thinly sliced beef that was dry and lacked flavour outside of the hot sauce that came with it. It was cooked to the point where it tasted like leftovers to be honest. The fries were decent and fresh but less salt would have been nice. I liked the salsa although it was little watery from the tomatoes. The eggs were pretty standard. I'm a little disappointed given the reviews. The box looked better than it tasted which is highly disappointing.  The staff seemed decent."}
{"text":"We ordered the steak taco, fries and sausage Sammy! It was delicious and the portion is good!   We came in the in the winter time so we can only sit side . It's a small space (seven chairs in total). It's a quick eat and leave.   Would totally come back again and try other items."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was very grainy, seemed as if the beans and chickpea were not cooked through. I didn't see or taste the roasted red pepper sauce or the sunflower sprouts. I felt like I was eating a pile of mush. The bun seemed very stale. Not sure if I would try this again. My husband has given everything on the menu a chance and wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots on queen st east.  There's nothing bad to say about anything on the menu but my favorite dishes are the completo sandwich either steak or chorizo are really good.  Also, the tacos are really good and authentic and again I enjoy the steak or choriO tacos but chorizo being more on my favorite side.  Check it out !"}
{"text":"Awesome, bold flavors!  We had some fries, tacos, and sandwiches, and they were all amazing.  The tacos were probably my favorite as I loved the shells and contrast, yet the meat was well flavored and the condiments balanced everything off amazingly.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I'm always on the look out for great taco places in Toronto and I have to say this is one of my favourites (there's also free street parking down the street which is always a plus). I have yet to try the sandwiches which I've heard good things about but the tacos are amazing. I've tried the steak and pork tacos and both were great. The shells are crispy and fried to perfection and the ingredients they use are so fresh.   Seating is a bit limited with only a couple stools inside, especially in the winter when you don't want to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"No big words needed, this is simply a really good sandwich place! No big fancy menus but it doesn't need it because what they do have is absolutely delicious, and you're pretty much guaranteed that something on the menu will be your cup of tea.   The classic churrasco is amazing, a huge portion of steak, pork, or spicy chorizo sausage with some delightful toppings. A big fave of mine."}
{"text":"Just devoured a veggie sandwich with hot sauce just epic flavors and textures... Husband had the steak box and absolutely loved it... This place is an absolute gem!!!"}
{"text":"I got a steak sandwich ($9 with tax) served on a toasted bun with mayo, diced tomatoes, mashed avocado and home made hot sauce. I didn't read the menu carefully when I made the order and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was spicy when I bit into it. Luckily for me, it was the perfect spicy level and it was very enjoyable.  The service here was wonderful! They brought the sandwich out for me on the patio and the owner even gave me some free fries and mayo!   It's a must try for those who are going to be around this area."}
{"text":"I love the chorizo tacos! They are the best I've ever had. The house hot sauce they put on them is amazing! I don't really like spice in general but it just goes so well with everything. All the ingredients are always fresh and delicious. Their corn chips are served warm with just the perfect sprinkle of salt. It's true that seating is limited and it might take a bit for the food to be ready. However it is totally worth the wait. The staff is really nice as well. You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The salad ingredients were so fresh I swear I heard angels singing. A great little lunch counter for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great spot for a sandwich on a patio with some spinach empanadas and a San Pellegrino. Friendly owners and great service. The daily juice squeeze is a nice touch and definitely worth a try. Highly recommended, just bring cash and be prepared to relax"}
{"text":"Holy crap their tacos are defreakinglicious!  Fresh chips and guacamole was also amazing.   You get a lot of food for your money.   My friend and I got an order of tacos(3 in one order) ,  guacamole & chips, and the box of fries that had the egg,  salsa and chorizo in it. All for $24 with tax!  We were too full to even finish the fries and chips.   They only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"Had the fries box with steak and eggs. It was good but a bit on the dry side. Then I popped the yolks and mixed it in with the box and everything was better. My wife got the veggie fries box and that was very good also.   I'll have to try the tacos next time."}
{"text":"OMG!! This place has one of the best sandwiches with avocado and pork I've ever tried. Their fries are home made, thin, crispy and delicious. Their salad is super tasty too. It's a tiny place with virtually no room to sit inside, but they have a lovely patio. Plus, their prices already include taxes, which makes your life easier ;)  I highly recommend this place for a quick bite if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Charming little sandwich shop on a side street, just off Queen Street. They serve tacos here as well, but I've only tried the sandwiches, and a hotdog once (which was tasty). I'm not overly hyped about the meat sandwiches, but the vegetarian one, made with a deep fried chickpea patty and loaded with salsa, avocado, and hot sauce, hits the spot. The photo I took - admittedly - is pretty lame and doesn't do the sandwich justice. I was pretty hungry and didn't have the patience or inclination to \"stage\" it and go all instagram food stylist on it. The fries here are also good."}
{"text":"$9 for a righteous sandwich that's fresh in every regard, has an awesome mix of homemade toppings and is just damn delicious. People working there are super friendly and helpful. Ask about the menu because they can mix it up.   Bonus: if you are having a pint / drink at Hitch and you can order in.   A needed addition to Leslieville - or anywhere for that matter."}
{"text":"Completo is one of my favourite places to get a taco in the city. It's always chill vibes. There's not a whole lot of seating here, but music is always playing here and the food always tastes good. I've had the steak tacos and box of steak and eggs with fries. Neither lacks in flavour.  Must-try items: Steak & Eggs w/ Fries Taco Box (comes with 3 hard shell tacos)  The staff here are chill and it's a nice place to eat in Leslieville. There's a lot more I want to try here. It should be noted that it's more for takeout than dining in. Seating is available on the patio in warmer months. Either way, they sell great meals for under $15 and can hang with the best of the comfort food spots in town."}
{"text":"Best tacos around, steak sandwich melts in your mouth. The staff are awesome. This place is cheap in price and unbelievably tasty. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"If you want the most delicious sandwich in Toronto go here.  The steak churrasco sandwich has the freshest tomatoes/avocados naturally raised beef an amazing indescribable sauce all in a fresh crusty bun. Wow!!! I've also had the vegetarian sandwich and tacos. Also incredible. And those fries!! Thin crispy and perfectly salted.   So Good. :)"}
{"text":"Update: last night I had a hankering and decided on completo, first time for dinner.  I ordered the steak sandwich, with an egg on top. This was nothing short of fantastic, if I put this in a burger category (red meat in between two pieces of bread at the same price point) honestly this is the best I've had in the city. Incredibly juicy. Flavorful, satisfaction overload... Just wow!!!"}
{"text":"Came back for a second visit! Completo completes each meal with a bang!   The tiny hidden gem was packed when I visited last weekend. Everything was still made to order. There was a 25 minutes wait for food! It was worth every minute.  The hard-shell tacos filled with Veggie Patty ($8) was delicious! The veggie pattie was accompanied by refried beans, mashed avocado, tomato-cilantro salsa, cheddar cheese, cilantro-lime crema, and house hot sauce! A heavenly combo!   The House Made Corn Chips ($6) served with mashed avocado, tomato-cilantro salsa, cilantro-lime crema was awesome! Freshly fried chip, bright toppings, what more can anyone ask for? The owner was kind enough to refill out mashed avocado, and tomato-cilantro salsa when we ran out cause our dip to chip ratio was off!   Thank you again for another great meal! :) Completo is the perfect place for comfort food!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Drove from Richmond Hill to this place just to eat their tacos. Always fresh ingredients and the taste hits the spot. Got carisso tacos which taste like beef patty in a nice authentic taco shell.  Also had the completo poutine and fresh cut potatoes with Mexican style topping like refried beans. Really good.  Only negative is that it kind of took a while and eating tacos get messy haha. Will come back again."}
{"text":"It was my second time there and took it to go , the first time I was more impressed , and ate on the out door patio . Not sure if that had anything to do with it but it seemed it was thrown together in a hurry and it had way too much sauce , it was dripping, and toppings were  falling out ,  I don't remember it being so messy it's a good thing I ate it at home. It had good flavour and nothing beats a warm toasty crispy bun . Given it's fast food gone slightly gourmet , definitely worthy he value and  the visit ."}
{"text":"Got the steak box which consisted of fries topped with steak and 2 sunny side up eggs.Steak seemed like it had no seasoning at all and I honestly could have done without that but the eggs,fries and hot sauce brought the dish back to life. Food was made fresh and I waited about 10 minutes. Seating is limited inside but they have multiple tables outside. Thankfully it was a nice day so I enjoyed my food outside. Fries are AMAZING lm sure I could eat 3 boxes of just fries by myself."}
{"text":"Love this little spot in Leslieville! I went with their steak box, which came with perfectly medium steak, 2 sunny-side up eggs, and some fresh salsa. I highly recommend it as the food is freshly prepared and served promptly. The prices are reasonable for the great quality of the food!  They also have some other delicious choices on their menu. Seating is a little limited here, but since the boxes are designed to be taken to go, you can easily find a different place to enjoy your food."}
