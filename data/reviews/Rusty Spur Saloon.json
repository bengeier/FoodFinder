{"text":"StaY away from the Crazy Man!! The Ponytailed bartender 'Jimmy'... Rude... Angry and Mean Spirited ..continued demanding (more) tips.. I told him kindly and with a smile...'you don't have to worry..we'll take care if you'.. And he grabbed our beers and told us to get out! Crazy Man.. Has issues..Stay Away!!... (Edited).. And COUNT YOUR CHANGE!.. He'll TAKE what he thinks he has coming to him without your offering it! Realized this after we left!! WOW."}
{"text":"Taking a break from the Old Town Scottsdale club scene and trying the other bars in the area had me going to the Rusty Spur Saloon. And I must say, I loved the place. The bar decor is that awesome cowboy look. It was a small place and yet they still managed to fit a band in there along with some seating. I don't know how but they did lol. The drinks were good and cheap and it's a great alternative to the usual scene."}
{"text":"This is what you imagine typical wild west salons to be like - it was AMAZING!  If anything, go to just check out the decor.  When we got there a band were playing country and western type music and they were getting everyone involved in the dancing and having fun.  It was a brilliant atmosphere and once again the decor was brill - although the venue was a little small.  Downsides were - bartenders a bit rude (maybe just busy) and the excellent dancers that kept hogging the dance space and not letting anyone have a go.  Yes - we know you're good but let the other patrons have a go!  This place is a must must must!"}
{"text":"The spur kicks ass! Jimmy and his band Psychobilly Rodeo is amazing. They  play all the songs the patrons request and put their own awesome, original twist on them; making the classic, boring, sterol  typical songs fun and lively! That chick at the reserved table is a bad ass dancer and gets all the boring people out on the dance floor busting a rug!  The bar tenders are so slammed,  busy attending to idiots and still accommodate all, quickly and courtesley, despite having to deal with dumb ass cheap tipping drunks! The spur has music every day of the week.  Monday night, Tuesday and Wednesday there is an extremely talented musician, Jan, who rocks the guitar!  best place to visit,  if you don't,  it's your loss!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Staff was ok, but the music rocks! Great fun in Old Town Scottsdale, a lil crowded but fun nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place never changes, which is good. The music is good, fun, and danceable, even though you might have to dance on the sidewalk outside! Drinks are well-made and well-priced. I always have fun here whether alone or with a date. I've never tried the food because I didn't know they had it. The bartenders work hard, do a good job and nicely model the logo shirts they sell."}
{"text":"THE place to go in Scottsdale to find people who aren't out to be seen.  This place is 1500 square feet and it s always packed on the weekends. The house band plays Thurs, Fri and Sat and with no cover charge at the door, this is one smokin' deal.  Only warning is stay with bottle beer--the mixed drinks are more mix than drink."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today; it was my first and last time here. Unfriendly bartender and waitress; grudging service, no smiles, no eye contact. Obviously don't like working there. Food was fast food quality. Singer was okay but nowhere near the professional level."}
{"text":"Rusty on customer service....  Really disappointed as the bar looked great, just the sort of place I normally like to visit as I'm a musician and love live music venues. Essentially the guy behind the bar was too busy talking to one of his regulars and it seemed like it was a real effort to serve us. No small talk and literally threw the change down on the bar and carried on talking to his buddy. Made us feel like a piece of crap on the bottom of his shoe. Pity as he had some really cool T shirts but instead of buying I voted with my feet.  Obviously doesn't like visitors."}
{"text":"Seriously great place.      Classic western bar looks, with great live music and a good beer / drink selection.     The place is just straight up fun."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for a business trip and stopped by with a coworker who lived in the area 20 years ago.  Great casual place to drink beers and listen to live country music.  Everything else in Old Town was pretty dead."}
{"text":"Was here this past weekend on a Friday night. The two bartenders were HORRIBLY rude and provided the worst service I've ever had. The bar wasn't busy at all (about 10 people total, we had 5 in our party), we were very polite. Had come here before and it was fine, but the two female bartenders were so rude and snotty that I definitely wouldn't return or recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a blast on Friday evening at the Spur.  Great entertainment and just overall a lot of fun!!"}
{"text":"Best place in Old Town to grab a beer and listen to some country music on a weekday night!  (At least when all the snowbirds aren't in town!)"}
{"text":"We just moved to Scottsdale and this is quickly becoming a favorite for us. :) Great live music and drink selection, and it's a fun and relaxed place to hang out.  We love it."}
{"text":"This is a great little dive bar. And I do mean little. The chairs are made out of saddles. Come when there's a live band in the corner. Not a lot of room but many people will be dancing. Definitely a must stop in old town."}
{"text":"This place was ever so fun.  The band was super entertaining as well as the crowd.  The only thing I could suggest is pouring their drinks in Red cups, seems like the only thing missing!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love the Spur! It never disappoints. I even sent my pastors here and they loved it. Just a ton of character, great music, and Denise is my favorite bartender!"}
{"text":"Watch your drink! We loved going in to have a cold one every time we are in Ole Town, one of our party experienced being hit by a drug. It could have been really bad, had we were not a large group and was able to care for our friend!"}
{"text":"This is a touristy western/country themed bar in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale.  It's probably a fun place to go if you like that kind of music, and are looking for a bar.  I stopped in with some family, and found it noisy and crowded.  They do have live music sometimes, which can be cool (again, if you're into country/western music).  In general, if you're looking to grab a beer in Old Town Scottsdale, you could swing in here for a bit of atmosphere and people-watching."}
{"text":"Best little bar in old town if you're looking for a hole in the wall, authentically local feel for a western bar. The people here always seem to be great people (typically an older crowd), and the staff is awesome. People come here to have a good time with friends, grab a drink, listen to music and be happy. Oh, and the live music here is perfect for any night of the week!"}
{"text":"Great place for live music, cheap beers and easy going atmosphere.  People are friendly and not sporting bro tanks.  Atmosphere is country theme, and beers aren't ridiculously priced like most places in Scottsdale.    If you are looking for a easy going, non-judgemental, non-testosterone fueled place for a good time, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Great entertainment in a cozy bar. Food was fine at a good price. Service was pretty slow though.   Clientele at lunch time were mostly older folks and some random tourists. The singer was great and played requests."}
{"text":"This is a fun small hole-in-wall bar. I gave them 1 star because the blonde female bartender has a nasty attitude. I was sitting at the bar and left my drink to use the restroom. When I returned my drink had been thrown away. When I questioned the bartender, she was over the top rude and nasty. Granted it wasn't a full drink but it was my drink nevertheless."}
{"text":"Best country bar in Scottsdale. Also its a cool place to relax your mind from a busy day at work. Also the band that plays on thursday nite to saturday nite is awesome.chheeeeehaaaa..."}
{"text":"This is one of Scottsdale's gems, this place is absolutely fun, best and most fun music in Scottsdale! I can't say enough on how fun this place is, whenever I have visitors from out of town this is one of the first places I bring up, and everybody I bring their enjoys it and especially the music !"}
{"text":"Yes this place is small but that what's makes it ooze character. The Rusty Spur is a true country bar smack in the middle of Scottsdale. They have live music every afternoon and night seven days a week. It's locally owned, has been around forever. You're always greeted with a a warm welcome from the servers, band and patrons. The atmosphere is great and dollar bills cover the walls and ceiling. Little known fact... every year they have a party where they take down all the dollars, Rusty Spur then matches the amount and it all gets donated to a local Charity. Yee haw!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that an establishment like the Rusty Spur would be placed in the middle of Scottsdale. Some backwater town outside of the Phoenix metro area, perhaps - but Scottsdale? The Arizona city known by outsiders for it's ritzy nature does have it's history though, and that history is steeped in the Wild West. So while at first sight, Rusty Spur may seem out of place, it shouldn't be a major surprise.  I'm a Massachusetts native, but lived in Arizona for two years. Out of the bars I went to, the Rusty Spur was easily the most memorable. I'll fully admit that I have an affinity towards the Wild West era (Cowboys and Native Americans alike!), so rather than deal with a typically modern Scottsdale area bar, the Rusty Spur is a welcome establishment.  The place has good food, great drink, and damn fine music. If you're into anything country, whether it be the music or the history, you're likely to enjoy the Spur.  I no longer drink, but if I'm ever in the Scottsdale area again I'll stop by the Rusty Spur for a bite to eat and to soak up the atmosphere. To me, there are few places like the Rusty Spur in all of the Phoenix metro area - it is a must visit place if you want to grab a drink in a true Cowboy Saloon without driving out to the sticks."}
{"text":"They don't serve the worm anymore! This place was chill its as small as a shoe box but its nice if you need a beer."}
{"text":"The band, the bar, the atmosphere was the most fun we had in old town. Imagine country red neck band playing neil diamond covers. Too much fun!!"}
{"text":"For a saloon it's probably the very best in Scottsdale!  Fun..small..really western feel. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great little country bar that has been here since 1951.  Perfect for out of town guest that want to have fun singing and dancing to live music.  A must do for visitors."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with beers and live music at the spur!"}
{"text":"This is a great place in the heart of old Scottsdale. It has the feel of a Locals joint.  However if you look around this is mostly a tourist crowd hoping to catch a little of the local atmosphere.  Nevertheless this is a fun place to grab a beer and dance (for those of you that dance).   Beer is cold and really cheap and a sand always seems to be playing.  A must stop in if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Authentic old school saloon. I liked it a lot here. Its a very small bar, but Its got stools, and whiskey at a fair price- thats all I need! Its right in Old Town & when I went, there was more of an older-tourist crowd as opposed to the college young'ins. I swear I also saw the worlds oldest cowboy here- had to be 142 years old.  So if your in a Cowboy chasin--whiskey drinkin kind of mood- check this place out."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have never reviewed The Spur! The is hands down the best \"have a great time\" bar is Old Town Scottsdale. It is located in the old bank and the vault that once held money now keeps the beer cold. They have live music every day and never charge a cover. They serve lunch, but plan on eating dinner elsewhere. The best time to be here is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night when the Psychobilly Rodeo Band plays. They are great! If you are easily offended this is not the bar for you. The place is tiny and gets packed quickly. The good thing is that if anyone even thinks about getting out of hand they are quickly removed. This is a great place to day drink, night drink, well anytime drink. Go and see the last real cowboy saloon in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale last week on vacation and just had to stop at the Rusty Spur for lunch. It was well worth it. It is a small place and very busy but a great atmosphere. The service was good and the food was even better. The live music was excellent! I even had to go home with a souvenir hat. I would go again if I was in town."}
{"text":"Fun small historical find.  A true cowboy hangout with live country music.  The tamale was amazing   5.00 the best deal ever!  Also great homemade tamale   Burger was great.  Service was ok  i think our server was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"What can I say...true great dive bar!  Cold PBR and great one man band playing. Bartenders were friendly. We'll stop by whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Giddy up bitches!  If you want cowboy music, a live band and to get really reaally drunk in a cool place in Scottsdale I highly reccomend The Rusty Spur.   Also, the Psychobilly Rodeo Band is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. They play the best country western standards with a few hilariously amazing original songs.   The only downside is that the bar is really small and tourists and hen party chicks come here. Other than that  - awesome in every way.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Though I have no idea about the food at this place, I am cheating! They have awesome bartenders and drinks and the best SONG menu in Oldtown!;). Tip the singer please! He rocks and you shouldn't be a cheap skate...! Not a good look!!;)"}
{"text":"Never been anywhere quite like it.  Full of well-oiled people (in a good way) before noon on a Saturday, an angel singing tunes with her guitar in the corner, some decent microbrewery beer and just the right sort of food to wash down with it."}
{"text":"Always a great time! The band is really good here on weekends but be warned, if your not a crowd person then avoid the busy nights as its a small place. During the day they have a GREAT chili dog. There are other great sounding options but I can't order anything else lol"}
{"text":"It's in Old Town so a bit touristy. Our server was a \"bucket of no fun\" but good for what it is and where it is. Beer prices for \"bottle only\" were pretty average."}
{"text":"This is our go to place whenever we are in Scottsdale.  Small, great music, ever if not a c ountry fan, good bar  food... Fun, fun, fun."}
{"text":"I knew it was love at first sight when I heard the troubadours belting out risque lyrics to old standards, but little did I know it was gonna be a train wreck of naughty after that.   Yes, I was the idiot who actually had the balls to ask Jimmy the bartender if they had wine, anything but Chardonnay (trust me, if I wasn't driving I would have bellied up for some whiskey and a beer) to which he responded \"well then darling, I have the pink one and some penis gigolo\".  He had me at the p word.   This is just a down and dirty saloon of epic proportions. Very friendly place with locals and tourists alike, folksy singers and a laid back vibe. Its super friendly, the staff is fast and the crowd runs the gamut from post dinner suits to cowboys. Kind of like heaven.   Note to singer: get your blues folks and rock and roll folks straight.....Robert Johnson was a blues man and I don't care how much I've had to drink, not buying your story about him being and influential rock and roll pioneer. Word from the home of the Blues."}
{"text":"Our vacation side trip on Saturday, 25 October 2014 to Scottsdale included a stop at the oldest saloon in Arizona. It was here, at the Rusty Spur Saloon, that we also experienced the oldest scam in the bar business.  My girlfriend ordered their special Moscow Mule made with Titos vodka. Sitting at the table directly in front of the bartender, she noticed him pour vodka from a bottle with a green label which he had pulled from the well at the bar. Titos, or favorite vodka, has a distinctive brown label.  When the waitress brought the drink in their signature copper mug, she was asked if the vodka was Titos. Her response was yes. I went to the restroom and on return had a direct view of the rail from which he pulled the bottle. No Tito's bottle with a brown label. Only the rail bottles of alcohol. And there it was. The bottle of vodka with a green label. The waitress saw me looking, and from the look on her face she was aware I had discovered the truth.  It is a shame that a bar with such a long history in Old Town Scottsdale is ruined by the blatant dishonesty of a bartender. How many guests had this bartender and The Rusty Spur Saloon ripped off over their tenure in Scottsdale in the name off the almighty dollar? I will write all of the review websites, the county council of Scottsdale, the tourism board of Scottsdale, and the owner of the saloon"}
{"text":"Had a great time at the Rusty Spur! Came around 430 PM and live cowboy music had just started. The singer was very talented, he kept me engaged even though I don't listen to country music! There was one waitress running the whole place, and she was very sharp and was able to keep track of what everyone had. There are 8 tables that can seat about 5 max and the environment is pretty relaxed. Great for groups of 2-5. Great place to visit in Old Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Lets just say this is a tourist type bar, but a pretty cool place to take out of town guests.  The food has always been good and reasonable prices.  The live music is great.  Took my adult daughter there for lunch today, as she was in town visiting and to walk around Old Scottsdale.  It will now be the last time I go there.  My question:  (to the bartender) Excuse me maam, is there any idea on how long for our food?  We have been waiting twenty-five minutes.  (order was a burger w/o-rings and a ten piece bar-b-que chicken wings).  Answer:  This is a small place and I only have one guy and one grill, yours is the next up.\"  WRONG ANSWER!  How about: \"Let me check on it\" or \"Oh we are a bit backed up right now - let me check.\"  At this time we counted.  Eight people eating food, the rest drinking beverages.  31 people in the place (which was full).  We also timed the food arrival from our question, 7 more minutes. I would have appreciated when we ordered her letting us know it would be this long.  I had never waited, even when crowded more than 15 minutes for food here.  The \"flip\" attitude of the bartender ruined any further visits from me with my visitors, and soured all my fun times I have had here.  Kind of feel bad, but, there is no reason to speak to a paying customer like that."}
{"text":"If ya wanna get cozy with complete strangers this is the place. Lots of fun great music"}
{"text":"We had a group of Cal Poly alums visiting Scottsdale for a 40th birthday and ended up closing down the Rusty Spur Saloon two of our three nights in town. Place is awesome, the live music on weekends is an absolute hoot, had us feeling like we were all back in San Luis Obispo at one of our favorite bars from college... Love this place!"}
{"text":"We came across this bar by accident while touring Scottsdale! As a visitor from Orange County this was an interesting and different place. They had different groups playing live music every few hours and everyone was friendly and tried to help each other take photos with the few interesting barstools they had. Very cozy yet fun place if you are bar hopping. We didn't have any food so I can't rate them correctly but we had a blast. It became even more interesting once we found out by a local that the bar used to be a bank in old days and where they stored their beer now was the actual vault of the old bank."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Food is good, staff is friendly, there is usually live music and it is authentic southwestern."}
{"text":"I read reviews and went. You got to be kidding me right! What a joke. Room smaller than my 2 bedroom apartment. Elbow to elbow people standing around talking. Have to say excuse me 10 times to squeeze through to the bar. Only one bartender on a Saturday night. Looked to see if there was an upstairs or a passage to another room with dancing or more bars, nope. I don't get those people. What's the point?"}
{"text":"Strange bar and the bartender was a sourpuss all night like he didn't want to be there. Decent live guitar player jammed several oldies and country pop songs. Strange crowd. One chick was hitting on me right in front of my wife. I kept trying to rid myself of her and finally realized the people next to us had money on the bar. Think she was a scammer thief because as soon as the $$ was gone she didn't come back!"}
{"text":"As a born and bred Scottsdale kid who first went to the Spur looooong before the current management took over, it sucked to be in this usually fun dance/bar last Saturday when the band was playing and the lead singer's clearly insecure \"girl\" was present and stinking up the joint with her clown car table full of bullies and bozos; these fools actully think they own the table by the front door where they park their pathetic behinds as if it BELONGS to them.  They only thing they \"own\" is a loser's sense of entitlement that reflects poorly on the band and the old hangout and bar.  Ironic that a \"western\" bar with a \"cowboy\" theme allows - and based on the \"huh, what?\" bouncer ignoring their behavior - encourages actions that represent the worst of humanity.  Will we be back?  Hell yes, as we are Scottsdale folks and will not let anyone run us out of anyplace we want to be in our hometown.  But for now, only on a Sunday when the bass player (who is in the band) is playing solo - he's a gem and a gent - or on a weekday when we can be sure the \"tip the fucking band\" leader isn't playing (a shame as he is talented) because when his piggish girlfriend and her gang of miscreants are present the bar is, frankly, a shit-hole of hate."}
{"text":"People have been drinking here since 1951, so I needed to try this place out for myself. Well, since Scottsdale is pretty empty in August, I was the only dude in there for about 15 minutes. It is a small bar with about 8 seats at the bar and some tables and a stage. The big TV is a homage to the present, while the decor is a throwback to the past. It is pretty much a must check out for a beer or two if your in the area and like bars and history. Embrace the cowboy past of Scottsdale before it's all gone."}
{"text":"This is the whole package.? Great ambience, amazing live country music, excellent burgers fries and onion ring any frosty brews! Nirvana in a little Western Saloon! It will be our go to place"}
{"text":"Come here for cocktails! We had all of the tamales and a recommended South of the Boarder Burger, and I must say that the cocktails were the best thing besides ambiance this places has to offer.  The burger could have been frozen, the cheese thin and lacking and the bacon and the buns were room temperature and not toasted and was so small that I would not recommend that burger to anyone.  The pork tamale with green sauce was 20x hotter than the chicken tamale with the same green filling and the beef tamale was dry and well just ok. Overall the tamales were dry and that's why they recommended the pork sauce \"gravy\"  on them because they are dry without it.  My recondition is to just get drinks there. They are good and it is a saloon!"}
{"text":"Fun times for sure. The place is a little small but don't let that discurage you. The house band is really awesome as well as very talented. If you're in the neighborhood you gotta stop even if it's a little crowded."}
{"text":"What a little diamond in the ruff this \"Saloon\" is.  One of my biggest complaints is that the Old Town Circuit doesn't have any unique spots.  Every bar is a cookie cutter copy of the others.   The Rusty Spur makes me think that I am in Austin.  Too bad it is a little far away from the usual stomping grounds.  This bar always has live music, and cheep beers.  It is a great spot to mix up an evening on the town.  The staff is friendly, and I think they encourage stumbling drunks to yell YEHAWW!  If you are from out of town, and want a truly cowboy type experience while out in Scottsdale skip Saddle Ranch, because that is manufactured in Hollywood, and skip the Coach House (unless it is a holiday) because it is too packed.  The Rusty Spur always seems to have the perfect amount of people having a good time.   And when everyone is having a good time, then I am certain to have a good time.  Check your attitude at the door and listen to a solid Arizona country cover band any night of the week."}
{"text":"I am not their ideal clientele.  Meaning I am a non- white female who doesn't drink and therefore found the place intimidating and a bit racist."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. They have live bands playing country music in the front of the saloon. It is very popular and gets crowded, with lots of people dancing and having fun. Service is limited, which makes it a bit hard to get served at the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar, nothing more or less than you would expect!  If you are looking for a stiff drink, some good music, and a casual environment this place is for you."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with Gabi on this one.  It could be me, but I have been here three times now, and each time, I have received terrible service.  I understand how some could love this place; it definitely has a unique atmosphere, but...when I get attitude with my beer, you lose me."}
{"text":"I love this saloon.  Great music, cool staff. Fun people.  Doesn't matter if you just want to have a beer or do some two stepping- super fun place to hang out.  Great ambiance.  My favorite watering hole in old town.  Bikers and business suits are both welcome."}
{"text":"FUN! I am neither a fan of county music, nor do I enjoy tiny bars packed to the gills w people ... HOWever, my friends and I had so much fun here! We were only in town for a night and weren't able to get out and enjoy Scottsdale until around midnight. We had to find a place that would be open late, and something unique to the area. After perusing Yelp reviews (and all of the booty barstool pics) I was sold!   We were instantly surprised at how small the space was, but the decor is charming and we still had plenty of space to move about. Happened to catch the last half hour of a live music set. And again, country music isn't my thing.....but I am a NC girl for life and I couldn't help but jump up and down when they started playing Devil Went Down to Georgia   The drinks weren't expensive, not cheap either. It was worth it for the experience. Can't speak for the food because we didn't order anything. Had quite a diverse group of friends with me that evening and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves thoroughly. Perfect county western dive, would return again!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Dive Bars - The Spur & Coach House can't beat 'em. Everyone is friendly, drinks and music are great."}
{"text":"Let me just say that this place is awesome!!! Totally unexpected and a must see!  From the doors to the decor to the food and the music it's old time country at its finest!  Kind of small and gets a bit crowded but the more the merrier!  The tamales are out of this world amazing!!!  A must try!!! If I could I'd make a trip from Tucson just to eat their tamales!!!"}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale one must stop at the Rusty Spur. Their marketing campaign puts them in every tourist magazine and make it a must see. We were standing out front debating if we wanted to go in at 2 pm or go back at night. Well we didn't have a chance to decide - someone comes out of the bar and says \"Come on In -  I'll introduce you to everyone\".  We follow this man into the bar - he tells the performer that Sarah & Matt are here in which he works our names into the song to say hi to us. This place is TINY. Max - 30 seats including the bar. It was a great mix of people - we were able to sit at the bar and watch people dancing and enjoying the afternoon. It's an interesting place that make you feel as if you are in the \"wild west\" not in Scottsdale. (Reminded me almost of a Disney-world ride - it's a 180 between the sidewalk and your first step in the bar)."}
{"text":"What a fun little, yet very entertaining bar.  The food was very well priced and tasty.  Would definitely recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Seriously FUN! We stopped in for one drink and stayed for two. Then went back later for another! The live music was awesome and everyone was having a good time.   It was fun to look at all of the wall \"decorations\". Some were hilarious.   Fun place to grab a drink and relax. Super small, but great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love, love, love country music! I felt right at home on the Sunday afternoon that I went. This little place has a whole lot of character. The walls are adorned with dollar bills, various license places, and other miscellaneous items. The crowd was a bit older, but very welcoming! Russ was the soloist.  And when he sang The Cowboy Rides away, I knew I would be back. He solicits tips (whether you think he is good or not) by having a regular come to each table with an \"offering\" plate...Lol. I thought I was in church. One worker was serving the whole place."}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of the Rusty Spur. If you have guests coming into town, this is the place to bring them. They will get the true Old Town Scottsdale experience with good ol' country music, dancing, and cocktails. It is great for all ages. I have come here multiple times with my parents, friends, co-workers, you name it (21+, of course). They have live music most (if not all) nights but definitely on Friday and Saturday nights. The drinks are inexpensive and it has a divey feel (my favorite). The only reason for the 4 stars is that it is very small so on weekend nights, you're usually rubbing up against people and it can sometimes take a while to get a drink or go to the restroom but other than that, it is definitely a 'must go' in my book! I know that i'll be back again soon!  P.S. Come here after you've eaten because they don't serve food!"}
{"text":"Rusty Spur is awesome and worthy of five stars. This great cowboy saloon has a full bar and bottled beer, no draft plus a fun menu of the usual suspects. It small but delivers a huge punch of authentic fun and it has dollar bills staples to the walls that people sign their names to making a statement of \"I was here!\"   Very casual, boots welcomed and if you don't have boots you can buy some next door. Old town is great. The free trolley stops directly outside Rusty's door so you can mossy on and around the old town area.    I did manage to have a few buzzard wings and some cowboy chili. The food is fairly good but the ambiance is insanely great. Day or night a live honky tonky guitar player is on stage and not too loud so you can carry a conversation as well.  Bottomsup bottomsup ye'all"}
{"text":"I totally love bars like this.  Its a dive but not in a gross creepy you should be worried way.  Its more like a fun, old, cheap, super cool dive bar.  It has the great old school western feel that I love.  You feel like you have went back in time as soon as you walk in the door.  The bar is on the medium/small size but they still have live music, plenty of tables and bar seating.  The service was good.  The people sitting next to us ordered food and seamed pleased but we were only there to drink.  The beer list was ok for a small dive bar and the house margaritas actually pretty good.  This was probably my favorite stop on my bar hop through old town."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Rusty Spur. Amazing little place, very friendly staff and great country music. Psychobilly Rodeo Band on thu - sat nights are fun. Drinks are reasonably priced too.. Try it out if you happen to be in the Old Town area.."}
{"text":"This place is soooo overrated, crowded and the music is not memorable.  Also, the band BEGS for tips!   Tacky!  One night a bunch of us girls went early enough to wait for the band to start and had a couple of rounds of beers when the bouncer came up to the table we'd been holding and told us that in ten minutes our table was reserved for someone else and we'd have to vacate.  The owner's response when we objected was \"So what.  I own the place\"  I'm a Scottsdale native and this experience just proved that Scottsdale's hometown feel is officially gone.  We walked over to Patty's and had a great time, forgetting about those fake cowboys at the Spur."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but tonight in 2016, I witnessed homophobia. Two men and their lady friends were dancing. The ladies began to dance together. Then the men started to dance together. It wasn't sexual. It wasn't \"gay.\" Just two guys enjoying the moment. The bouncer immediately ran in and broke up the two men and said that isn't allowed here. The women however could keep dancing uninterrupted. I thought we progressed more than this. Sad."}
{"text":"When Lindsey recommended that we go to the rusty spur, I was pretty excited. A real saloon! Maybe I can get a Sasparilla? Not exactly... But I did get hit on ruthlessly by 60 plus year old Canadians, danced a little to a sweet rendition of John Denver and had some whiskey shots with fellow yelpers.  It reminds me a bit of Nashville in that it is a honky tonk that's much smaller and much cleaner than any giant country bar you would find in Texas. The drinks are pretty strong, which I can appreciate, and the bartender was definitely surly. To be fair, we came in like a whirlwind of 25 half drunk maniacs. There is definitely some eye candy there, good tunes and who doesn't love a place with dollar bills stapled all over the walls?  Not a bad spot if you are in Scottsdale. And certainly better than going to a Vegas style club IMHO."}
{"text":"Loved this place! True, it's tiny and gets crowded but the atmosphere is fun, safe, and friendly. Still retains the Old Town feel too! My drink was good and the pricing was typical. We had live music the night we were there and it was great too! I would definitely recommend this bar and plan to visit again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Great western bar in Old Town Scottsdale.  The live music is great, the beer is cold and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Take the - Grab some suds , sit back and enjoy one of the Original Salons left in Scottsdale.. Good prices on grub and always fun - have been stopping here for years at least 2 or 3 times per /- great place to bring out of town friends.  Pretentious Snobs please keep walking there isn't enough room for you here.. LOL   You can take  cab to the Coachhouse from here and few other local taverns- Patti place . Cheers"}
{"text":"Bring your Bros who can't even stand up and order a drink but if you're a female who seems tipsy they won't serve you.  Gender discrimination alive and well here."}
{"text":"Old school country music with great drink prices!  Great spot after a Spring training game! Always a good time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Bloody Mary before Brewers vs Giants spring training game. Cute little place with cowboys and tequila theme. Puny cocktail by Wisconsin standards. No food goodies nor beer chaser come with it. Not worth $6"}
{"text":"SO much fun on a Saturday night. There is such an awesomely diverse crowd here--\"cowboys\", true-western folk, young pretty girls, old loving couples, 20-something preppy boys, etc. It seems as though everybody comes here for a good time.  The Rusty Spur is pretty small--so be prepared to feel crowded. But if you don't mind that, give it a try--fun music, fun dancing, fun night!!"}
{"text":"Randomly wandered into this place while my family was shopping for dream catchers in the downtown scottsdale area. This place is one of Arizonas oldest and most historic bars. If anything else, drop by for a brew. Check out the history. Awesome seats at the bar.....you will have to see for yourself"}
{"text":"Looks western but doesn't feel it!  Cant imagine this as a local bar more a tourist bar.  It's an okay bar with some good live music.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"If I lived in the Phoenix area, I'd try to be a regular at this place. $3 ice-cold PBR, awesome live music (AKA REAL country-western), fun decorations, nice bartenders, and no pretension. It's a old-school western dive where one feels right at home...the kind of place where strangers smile at and laugh with one another. I've heard that you just about can't even get through the door during snowbird season, so I'm happy we were able to have a great time here TWICE last week. If you visit Scottsdale, you HAVE to stop here for a cold one, or four."}
{"text":"A stop you must put on your list even visiting Old Scottsdale!  Small but great atmoshere!"}
{"text":"We are Canadians and the four of us have been coming to Scottsdale for many years and frequently visit the Rusty Spur and enjoy great song entertainment and service but not today at 1 pm  yes pm afternoon!! Not busy here like night time  and received 2 rounds over two hours from an abrupt stern looking waitress but then when we asked the waitress for our cheque,  which was not when the music was playing, another round appeared??  We explained we hadn't ordered it and finally received the final cheque with three drinks and left a tip of 10% but when i handed it to her she said it was an insult and to keep it!!!????!    We already paid for four drinks we didn't order???? Rude, rude, rude waitress!!  Music was great!"}
{"text":"Look no further ...this place is old Scottsdale ...jimmy is the man grab a beer or three and chill"}
{"text":"Live music.  Very small divey bar in the middle of non-divey old town scottsdale.  Drinks are cheap, bartender makes you feel welcome (he's the only employee as far as I can see) and I don't even know if they serve food.  Musician was friendly and played whatever you ask him to play..as long as he knows it!"}
{"text":"I love this bar. It has everything you could ask for in a small country bar. Well worth a trip and cheap"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall.  Visiting from Dallas for a meeting and this place was fun.  Sat in the big ass chick stool and that was funny to get pics from that.  Decent price on drinks.  Not sure but I think it was non-smoking. We never noticed any smoke.   Bathrooms clean."}
{"text":"Live Country Music was good and decent mix crowd of all ages on a Sat night....  Drinks are expensive considering $5.00 for Vodka Cranberry in an 8 oz cup, (if that) filled to the rim with ice.   Less ice in drunks and I'd give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall. Had the grilled cheese sandwich and onion rings here. Grilled cheese with Swiss cheese was really good! One of the best out there. Perfectly toasted and melted cheese. On sourdough bread. Onion rings were ok. Also tried the tamales. Really good and flavorful. Live music and really engaged audience. Fast and friendly service. The seats at the bar was fake bottoms. Very funny. People put money on the walls and they donate it. Fun bar."}
{"text":"Tip the band y'all!   I think this is the place Toby Keith was thinking about when he wrote \"I love this bar\" .   It's an awesome saloon right in Old Town, do not miss it!  It's tiny, there are cowboys, the beer is cheap, the decorations mesmerizing, the band is awesome, and the crowd is the most bizarre and interesting, eclectic mix of individuals you'll ever see.  Especially on the dance floor.   It's a small place, so expect to be jostled around a bit... just go with it, everyone's usually friendly! In the spring there are lots of tourists at the Spur, so if you are a local they'll love you even more.   So stop by the Saloon after Spring Training, or on a Saturday afternoon when you need a pick-me-up, this place will get 'er done!     And don't forget to tip the band!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up from me!!!  Stopped by here on a Thursday afternoon for a refreshing drink and a snack. The Margaritas were delicious and just the right amount of a-a-a-alcohol! (So I know what to blame according to Mr. Foxx) We also ordered two tamales. One chicken one pork. I must say for having tamales at a semi-divey bar these were quite excellent! Tasty, moist and decent size. I was quite impressed!  The place itself looks like a fun place to hang at if you're ever there in the evening when a band is playing or there's music. The decor and the service is very inviting.   Great job Rusty Spur!"}
{"text":"This place could be a great little saloon if you could get rid of all the drunk college kids and wanna-be cowboys, and then find a decent band that isn't constantly begging for tips.  On the up-side, its a great place to hang out if you're a drunk college kid or some wannabe-cowboy who likes listening to some half-assed band beg for tips all night long."}
{"text":"Me and a friend were looking for a local bar that was open late, and we stumbled into the Rusty Spur Saloon one night. I was a little hesitant at first but I'm glad that changed. There was a live act that was playing some good old classic country music and boy was he good! The drinks were just as good as the atmosphere and I definitely can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I just love this place. They always have live music, a good crowd and cheap drinks! I think I give it 4 stars because it would just be weird to give a dive bar the full 5-star rating. If you tip the band, they'll play just about any country song you desire. And I've seen the It's a pretty fun place to start your nights or just pop in during a low-key week night for a beer!"}
{"text":"In the wild wild southwest there lives a saloon. A saloon that has been around for years and years. In fact, this saloon takes credit for being the first saloon in Scottsdale. No matter what's going on outside the doors on the streets of Old Town; whether it be crowded during spring training or 115 degrees and dead, it's always the same inside the Rusty Spur. The moment you step foot through the doors, you're immediately transformed into a time warp when John Waynes ruled the city and two stepping was the only dancing worth doing in this desert.   This is one of my favorite saloons in Old Town. Here, it doesn't matter how much your outfit cost, what kind of purse you have, what your wearing or who you're with. As long as you're ready to have a good time in a crowded setting with plenty of live country music, you're welcome. Here, everyone treats you like a friend and nobody gets upset if their drink spills a little because someone two stepped right into their arm. Here, it doesn't matter if it's 1:00 PM or 1:00 AM because the atmosphere will be the same with most likely the same cover Country band performing. This is truly a gem in Scottsdale. There's a reason it's been around since the beginning and will most likely stick around until the end."}
{"text":"Always love heading to the Spur. Great Drinks, Great Bands and Great Service! and fun people watching! It really is a good time. If you are in the area I suggest stopping by. Keep in mind it is VERY, VERY tiny so when it does get packed you are in there like sardines!"}
{"text":"Well if you did your google search you already know the history of this saloon. This was a must stop for us. Stopped in on a Monday around noon and to our surprise all the tables and bar were  already full. The place is small with about 10 tables and maybe 10 seats at the bar.  We stood waiting less than 5 minutes when we could get a seat at the bar. I ordered a cadillac margarita and the very nice bartender knew how to make a perfect quality drink (justifies the price too lol!) I ordered the tumbleweed salad with chicken and hubby ordered taco salad with chicken. Both great. There was live entertainment and the singer at times  sounded exactly like Willie Nelson. It was fun to look and read all the memorabilia on the walls. Really was a great,  comfortable friendly place to have a drink and/or eat. The Bartender and server were outstanding."}
{"text":"Always a blast- just wish there was more room when it comes to \"getting down\" on the dance floor! GREAT PEOPLE WATCHING!"}
{"text":"An iconic saloon in Old Town Scottsdale that is a must stop to take out of town guests. It's tiny inside, so you will have an opportunity to meet your neighbors as you will be elbow to elbow. There is always live music to enjoy. Steve plays on Monday & Tuesday afternoons and is always entertaining. Tim works behind the bar and is quick with your order."}
{"text":"My GF and I went there and the music was good.  However, we are in AZ and thought Nachos would be a safe bet.  I tried to order them with chicken (a 1.50 up charge and the bartender advised they already come with meat and beans)  I went without the chicken.  We have been around the world, currently living in the pix area, and these by far are the worst nachos we have ever had.  More than half the stale chips had nothing on them.  Beer was fine, music was good, but I would never eat there again.  $12.00 for the nachos?  If I was the owner or cook I would be embarr assed"}
{"text":"I feel like this bar boasts a good mix of tourists who are on the chill side and locals who just want a dang drink while they listen to some classic music. There was a great little band playing Johnny Cash covers and a delightful big booty barstool we got to sit in while we enjoyed our prickly pear margs before wandering around old town.  Bonus points for the friendly bartender who gave us a great \"Happy F**king Birthday!\" sticker for our dad's 80th birthday party. It really made the table decor."}
{"text":"So tiny.....TOO TINY   i was introduced to every-ones butt or frontal parts and they walked past me trying to get the the bar...   there was a dance floor... but only one couple could dance at a time...  I know country bars very well and well if there is good music you'll wanna dance... well... i couldn't...   It was a Thursday night... so maybe i should go on a slower night... like Monday...   the band was pretty OK...   the security guard was the hottest thing around... :)   and the bathroom was super clean :)    your call"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I imagine out-of-towners come to to try and get that Southwest experience. In fact the night I was here I think,as a local, I was in the minority. And by local I refer to the large group of Scots in the bar dressed in Western wear having a HELL of a time in this \"wee, bonnie bar\"  The place is tiny but lively with good live music, cheap drinks and a crowd that likes to have a good time. This is a nice alternative to a lot of the other places in Scottsdale. Definitely a place I need to hit more often for some live country music and definitely a place to bring out of town relatives and friends.  Good times."}
{"text":"This place is a classic Old Town Scottsdale watering hole.  They have a very good selection of beer at good prices considering that you don't have to pay a cover charge for the live music.  The guitar player/singer who was there the other nice was very entertaining to listen to for a while."}
{"text":"Scottsdale's Last Real Cowboy Saloon... I totally thought I'd reviewed Rusty Spur before as I've been more times than I can count.  I'll agree with most of the positive reviews already written about this place - it's laid back, un-pretentious, hole-in-the-wall, and fun!  I'm not a huge country music fan either, but when I come to Rusty Spur, I love it!  You can't help but smile and have a great time at this place!  If I don't start out here at Happy Hour, I end the night here whenever I'm out in Old Town.    I'm left with a souvenir tank top that Jared bought me in his drunken state the other night when we were hanging at the Spur.  It says: ALL JACKED UP Big Time Since 1951 RUSTY SPUR SALOON Scottsdale, AZ  It's cute, but not quite as wonderful as entering into the doors of the Rusty Spur and leaving your troubles behind to enjoy the country music and cowboys that surround you!"}
{"text":"I heard a few of my colleagues had gone to the small western dive bar for after dinner drinks. This place is located in Old Scottsdale AZ. It has a charm to it and quite frankly a place people should go to visit especially if you are from out of town. All types of people visit this place. A 1 man band was playing some country western songs with his guitar and everyone was just singing along. What really blew me away was when the bartender started singing from a wireless mic behind the bar. So the guitar man performs and this bartender,  his name was Jimmy, sees to the tune was perfect pitch and harmony. When a Johnny Cash song started playing a signature jail house song, I thought he sang it better!! This bartender did not miss a beat taking orders from people while singing!!! Amazing! Now some of the country songs had a lot of double meaning so if you are timid, don't go. If you are about having fun and are not ahy, this is a great place to be. He pours his drinks very suitably, and he is a nice guy to boot! The only thing is, if you have a nice woman, be prepared for the locals to chat to her, and wanna buy her drinks. The guys are very aggressive but will not disrespect your girl if she politely declines. They have quite a selection of beers, and they have a walk in ice box! Simply put, you gotta try this place no matter what!"}
{"text":"The Rusty Spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in Arizona and a gen-u-ine registered historic landmark. It's even got a hitchin' post for yer horses out front. The Spur has been patronized by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood -- although never while I've been there. There's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week. Other good things include plenty of parking, no cover, and a fun venue to people-watch."}
{"text":"Very cool Country ball with a live band.  The band is great and they interact with the crowd!!  Very small space, so it gets crowded quick!!"}
{"text":"Speechless! I lived loved loved the onion rings fresh and crispy...the ambiance great and is very kicked back."}
{"text":"Was walking by when I heard the song I love this bar by Toby Keith. Its One of my favorite songs so I walked in. I was surprised to see It was being sung live in a great little dive. Definitely a must if your into dives. Make sure you post a signed dollar on the wall :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes you wish God, oh just this once, would grant you the power to reach right through your computer screen and smack some doofus on the other side.  Well, I've come to make this request to a higher power.  The negative reviews about The Rusty Spur make my head swim like it would after a pull of Mezcal straight from the bottle.   This place is tip-fucking-top.  You don't want to be pressured to tip the band?  Then pay a cover.  Would that make ya feel all better?  No cover to enjoy a genuine Texas (read: \"real\") country band?  Holy smokes, they will even do covers of Robert Earl Keen and Pat Green.  Go to any other shite bar in the city and ask them if they know that.    The place is tiny, which lends to its charm.  This place is STRAIGHT out of Luckenbach and these suburbanites don't even know the characteristics of an 'outlaw country' bar.  Waylon and Willie would be proud of this place.  Plus, they serve Shiner Bock in a bottle.  Unreal.    The dance floor, which is a misnomer, more like a shuffle floor is absolutely legit in accordance with the rules of a Texas dance hall, except for the fact that you bump into tables instead of only other dancers.  Go watch Urban Cowboy and tell me that you need your dance space.  Get over it.  .... and .... AND! ... \"Beans\" in the chili?  WTF?  This ain't Canada.  Hell, this aint even Ohio!  Beans should NEVER disgrace a proper pot of chili.  Jesus.  What the reviewer who mentioned that has just informed me is that they make their chili proper.  But I'd never know because I go in here to hoot n holler n get rowdy with the rest of the crowd ... drink a Shiner and dance a little two-step to Merle ... not stuff my face like a tourist.  Christ.  I'm in no way a regular here, but this place is one of the very few legitimate country bars, not only in Phoenix, but worldwide.  I've been in enough to know.  It should be regarded very highly for its genre."}
{"text":"My first visit to Phoenix and we were staying in Old Scottsdale.  I wanted a place to hear live music near our hotel and I discovered The Rusty Spur.  What a great little bar!!  Our bartender Allie was super sweet and very attentive to every patron.  Will definitely return on our next visit."}
{"text":"I use to love taking guests/clients/co-workers in town to the Rusty....but when Psychobilly band plays,  I have be careful who I take...   Jimmy and his raunchy lyrics...get kind of old after a while.  And he yells ever 5 minutes to TIP the F**king band...that gets old too!   Handle Bar J's is larger not as quiant as R.S.  but classier I guess.   Bring back the other band!"}
{"text":"Yee haw! A small bar so get there early if you want a spot to sit. Otherwise, enjoy the person next to you as you'll be cheek-to-cheek with them. LOL. Great bands and great drinks!!"}
{"text":"Great music, fun crowd, excellent nachos. What a weird thing to say that some of the best nachos I've tasted from the little hole in the wall in Scottsdale, Arizona. But the truth of it is that these most excellent nachos were enough to share. The chips were warm and crispy. The nachos were loaded but not soggy. Great balance.  Adequate drink selection.  I will be back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Rude bartender.  He (Tim) ignored us and was super unfriendly. Guess Scottsdale is a captive audience."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere with a great band.  It should have been a fun night with friends. Unfortunately, the bouncer was completely crazy.  I waited in line to get in and when it was my turn, I was let through the door.  When I turned around, I noticed some of my friends didn't get in so they were still at the door.  I went back to the door to ask them if they wanted me to get them something at the bar and the bouncer flipped out yelling and swearing at me. I was confused because I hadn't done anything to him. He physically turned me around and shoved me hard from behind almost causing me to fall.  For perspective I am a petite woman. 5'1 and I weigh 100 pounds.  I was wearing high heels and a dress.  I was embarrassed and upset to have been treated that way.  My husband saw what happened and when he approached us the bouncer was yelling and swearing telling my husband that \"I'll throw you the F out of here right now!\" I have no idea what set this guy off, but I recommend some coaching before you guys end up with a lawsuit from him taking things too far. I was not hurt but the force with which he pushed me was completely out of line. I have attached a photo so that you know who it was."}
{"text":"Great bar. I took my care give elder he love cow boy style and met ppl all over the world and states . He enjoy talked all ppl had great time. Every nights music are great drinks are reasonable no need HH . Bartender was very beautiful and nice ladies I was really happy stop by for Larry. I end up enjoy my self!"}
{"text":"This was the first bar we saw open at 8pm on a Monday night. Not a fan of country but my gf is so we stopped in for a drink. This place is so tiny I can't imagine it on a Friday night when it's packed . In my opinion this is the type of place single guys go to pick up chicks not the type you bring your girlfriend too, could still be fun but that's just me"}
{"text":"For some reason I had missed out on the rusty trombone...errrr...spur while I lived in old town.  What a shame.  I went last night for the first time and wished that it was in midtown so I could drink there regularly.  Salty bartender who sings from behind the bar and sassy guitarist/singer up on the stage were both great.  The pour was strong and reasonably priced.  I think if I got too drunk I would be pretty tempted to start pulling dollars off the wall and tipping with them.  The place is pretty small though but It kind of lends itself to making new friends and getting a loud and rowdy."}
{"text":"I love this joint. It is a tiny hole-in-the-wall place, and it has kind of a no-frills bar, but the music is awesome and everyone is always so friendly. I try to avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights because it gets so crowded and difficult to get a drink. But otherwise it is a super fun and welcoming joint for locals and visitors alike. When people visit from out of town, I always bring them here."}
{"text":"Not a destination place for its cuisine! Good for a beer, listening to live country music, and checking out eclectic decor. But the hockey puck $10 burger; yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is mostly for drinking beer and listen Live music mostly country music. It was fun meeting different kind of interesting people."}
{"text":"The spur burger is delicious I would recommend it to anybody very fresh and definitely juicy! The fries are delicious is well. We just happened to stumble across this place while walking through Old Town with some relatives from out of state. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday after seeing the Rusty Spur on Check Please on PBS...small cute dive bar...very small but a good place for lunch. The Spur Burger was really good but it really needs a sturdier bun for the size of the burger and toppings...The bottom bun was soggy. Maybe they should place the lettuce and/ or the onion on the bottom bun to keep it  from getting soggy...fries were very good and seasoned perfectly for my taste...the bartender/ waitress could have been a bit friendlier. Enjoyed the entertainment...would definitely return for lunch when we're in the Valley..."}
{"text":"Just a truly fun little saloon with random live music at lunch in the middle of the week. We do not skip a visit when we are in Scottsdale. Honestly? The food is really good as well. The \"best\" tamales? I would actually agree with that. Def"}
{"text":"If I didn't really love the band, I'd give only a 1-star after this evening. It's a great local place with live music and cheap drinks. However, I've been going to RS for years and tonight was treated quite badly. When I noticed that a very intoxicated girl had spilled her drink on the dance floor (and waited about 10 minutes), I finally brought it to the attention of the security guy (who happened to be sitting right in front of the spill). I suggested (at first politely) that he might want to attend to the spill and avoid a possible \"slip and fall\" lawsuit because I enjoyed going there and it would be a shame if it was closed down for something like that. He very sarcastically replied, \"Thank you for telling me how to do my job.\" Yes, I then replied with a bit of profanity which I instantly apologized for and he did not accept. The profanity was not in any way directed at him, but rather the possible consequences of not cleaning up the spill... \"you could wind up with a f*#@king lawsuit.\" Instead, he became instantly defensive and I just left. The guy at the door was very nice and polite. My intention was only to help."}
{"text":"pretty cute SMALL little bar. Great live country band the night I was there :) Don't forget to leave your signed dollar on the wall!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good dive bar? The Rusty Spur is awesome. If you haven't been here, you need to go ASAP. This place always has live music and they take suggestions from the crowd which is fun. It's tiny in there, but I think it adds to the atmosphere. There's all sorts of fun things all over the walls that are cool to look at and the drinks are cheap. I would be really shocked if you didn't have a good time here, even if you aren't that into country music. It's just very western/old school Arizona feeling and a fun change from the rest of the bars in Old Town (it's also sort of away from the rest of the bars). When I graduated from college my dad, my stepmom and I all went to Saba's, bought boots, put them on, and walked over to Rusty Spur to get our drink on. I highly suggest you do the same ;)"}
{"text":"It's a tiny place, so it get's packed, but it's a blast when the live music is playing on weekends. Every time you go you find something else interesting hanging on the walls that you missed the last time. It's a mixed crowd and everyone appears to be there just to have a good time. I recommend checking it out if you haven't been there."}
{"text":"Okay, it's lunchtime, and you are shopping in downtown Scottsdale.  The Rusty Spur Saloon is right at the center of downtown, it's rather cheap, and you can have a \"brew\" to fortify you while your wife shops 'til YOU drop.  Hamburgers, fried onion rings, fries, side salads, tamales, and other southwestern fare will get your tummy satisfied.    The saloon's walls are adorned with auto license plates as well as Rusty Spur garments (caps & T-shirts).  For further entertainment, they have a corner of the small establishment turned into a mini-stage where a \"cowboy\" serenades you from about 1pm 'til whenever.  Fast, decent fare, some local color for the tourists, it's a good spot for lunch in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I will do this in two parts. I have had drinks here several times. It is always the live music that draws me in off the streets. I just hear that guitar twang and suddenly I am whooping along with the rest of them. Being a western themed bar in Olde Town, you are going to get your share of photo snapping tourists. But the service is good and the beer is cold Happy Hour runs a buck above par. But I love live music. And this is the kind of place that you can gaze around and see something different each time. And the barstools shaped as chubby cheerleader asses never get old. I have never hit the place at lunch hour, but I will update when I do. Gotta try those Buzzard Wings they sell up. Food only serves until 4. Remember that. But so many choices nearby if you miss it. They sell great Scottsdale Tees and Hoodies, too. For the holiday giving time. I like to remind mom that I am having fun living here in the desert, Happy Hour fun."}
{"text":"Visited this \"saloon\" in Old Town, Phoenix but I was severely disappointed.  Was looking for a nice place to listen to some country and maybe do a little dancing with the wifey and heard this was the place to go....Nope!  The place is horribly small, no room to even stand in there much less make it to the bar to get a drink.  The music was live but I'm not a big fan of the whole \"give me a tip and I'll play you a song\" deal.  How about you play some good songs and then I'll give you a tip.  I will not be going back and I don't recommend."}
{"text":"A great Scottsdale staple!  Good bar staff and fun music.  Mike the bartender is my favorite.  Also a place to take visitors.  And a favorite spring training stop."}
{"text":"5 stars minus one for being so small and always packed. Plus one star for country music (live and otherwise) round the clock. Minus one star for mediocre food. But who comes here for food? So u get your star back. Back to 5 stars, but...  Whos the old, slow-moving, angry at life broad behind the bar? Not a pore of friendliness in her being. And the cocktail waitress, despite being so packed that he had no where else to stand and order his drink except at the server well, didnt say \"excuse me\" to him...she said, and i quote, \"that doesnt work for me.\" so 2 stars off for the unfiendly staff."}
{"text":"On a Monday night, this sounds like the most boisterous fun place to be in this area. The 2 men guitarist really lift up this small historical saloon with their comments and personality. I like the country decor of animal trophy, dollar bills and cowboy memorabilia. I personally adored the buffalo and elk this night!  Look for your state on the license plates tacked throughout the walls.  Great bartender. Easy parking. Bottled beers, liquors and various bag of chips for sale. Fun and comfortable."}
{"text":"The Rusty Spur Update 2008:  Of course our first stop in Scottsdale after dropping our bags off at the hotel was to the Rusty Spur.  The bar is still fun, but poo-poo on them for the new Arizona no-smoking law.  We had a hilarious female performer on our first day there who kept calling my friends out by making them sing and dance.  That's so friggin cool of her.  (I'll update this when I double-check what her name is.)  Our ever-familiar bartenders were no longer working there.  Sadly, our favorite bartender, Thelma, quit working there five months ago.  She was one of the folks who would take care of our loud, rowdy, alcoholic crew.  At any rate, still a fun place, but -1* for no more Thelma and no more smoking.  This place is still going to remain an annual destination even without those things, but what a shame to have them gone. **************************************************************************** I can't wait to go back to Scottsdale for Spring Training and hit up our hole, the Rusty Spur.  I'm heading out there and I look forward to the bartenders and live band for my fourth year.  The bartenders are awesome and remember my name from year to year.  That's pretty cool, since we're only there for six days every year in March.  Enjoy the chill vibe inside.  This will be updated again upon my return this year."}
{"text":"This was an awesome little bar with some not so awesome service.    Rusty Spur would easily be a 5-star joint if we weren't treated like sh*t by the waitress/bartender.  When a friend mentioned how cute the menu was, she was told by said waitress/bartender that she better not slip it in her purse and that if she wanted it, it'd cost her $3. Dude...seriously? Assuming your customers are thieves is not cool. The musician making fun of New Yorkers and calling us out to tip an extra $20 (after at least $10 was put in the tip jar) because we \"had plenty\" was kind of BS too.    On the bright side? It's a really cool space with kick-ass customers (not counting us). Did we catch it on a bad day? Maybe...If the place attracts cool patrons, it can't be half bad."}
{"text":"By writing this I get that I am admitting to attending this venue at least once.  Truth be told, I love to drop in this  place and hear the old true Western and cowboy music done live by performers who are passionate to keep it real and alive!  IT makes me feel like a real American.  And it puts the flavor of good times without complications in your heart.  It is an old dependable friend waiting to give you a quick drink and a song to sing a long to.  It seems to always wait with open arms to offer you reflection time or a rowdy time with a few of your friends.  And somehow,  the touristy venue attendees all seem ready to get to know you.   Pull up a seat or notice the barstool girlie legs give all their Americana to the experience.  While I would not consider eating anything here....I would boldly drink my ginger ale out of a dirty glass here.."}
{"text":"True old county.  I don't think there is anything else on this earth I like more than this bar. Great music.  Cheap drinks. Awesome crowd"}
{"text":"This is a hot mess at night.  In a fun way, if you're in the right mood and drink. ;)   I love it.  Night is super crowded, as in nowhere to move so be forewarned. The great thing about this place is that they have live music all day every day.  Country music. Yee haww!  It's dark, covered in dollar bills and super casual.  Whether you're here for Spring Training, you're a local, just visiting.. it's super fun.  I don't often eat here, rather come for people watching, music, and beer; but their tamales are great. I particularly love the green chili chicken tamale.  Yum!"}
{"text":"First off just wanted to say you have THE BEST bouncer in town!  What a treat on Wednesday night to hear the singing bartender.  We went back Thursday and Friday as well, fun atmosphere and can't wait to visit next year!!!  And you never know who might show up to sing a song.  Special thanks to the Psychobilly Rodeo Band, the singing umpire and Ryan Bexley!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad time at the 'Ol Rusty Spur! A true cowboy bar in the heart of Old Town. They're always slangin' stiff drinks and cold beers. There's usually live music throughout the week. It can get a bit cramped on a busy night but everyone's friendly and looking to have a good time. Don't pass up the opportunity to experience this place when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is great if you want to listen to live country music and drink. If you want to eat? Not good at all.  My burger was straight out of the freezer and burnt to a dry crisp topped with canned green chilies along with bacon that might have been crispy at one point but was cooked to bacon dust. The onion rings were clearly frozen together when they dropped them in the fryer because they came out as one clump. Awful."}
{"text":"Great little \"Saloon.\"  Live music, good beer, and nice staff!!  A bit on the touristy side, but fun none-the-less!!  Didn't eat, but would go back again!   It gets really crowded, so if that's not appealing to you, you may have to try somewhere else, and there is no shortage of cool places in the neighborhood!  If you can, check it out.  We really liked it."}
{"text":"Cute tourist bar/saloon in the heart of Scottsdale. There are lots of things to look at while you sip your drink and listen to the live music. They do not have draft beer, just bottles. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The location of the Rusty Spur couldn't be more perfect.  It's in the center of Old Town Scottsdale.  The place is small, quaint and very western.  The decor is fabulous.  It looks and feels like a real saloon even down to a couple of the bar stools.  We were waited on immediately.  The food was good and the server attentive in the beginning but as the crowds started rolling in we virtually lost our server.  We finally had to go to the bar to pay it.  As I mentioned the place is small and gets packed.  It's hard to hear at your own table when others are trying as hard as they might to be heard by the groups at their own table.  People end up trying to talk over the top of each other.  Thus, noisy.  Been there, done that and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Decent bar food, good drinks, nice atmosphere - fun watering hole."}
{"text":"So glad I finally came to check this place out! It's very small inside but filled with character. The live music is super good. And the photo op with these bar stools alone  is worth the visit !"}
{"text":"Because its so small, when they have live music (which is usually the case & also happens to be part of the draw to the place) its very loud. But the food is AWESOME. I just order my food for pick up :-)"}
{"text":"Historic bar old town Scottsdale, awesome environment but it is tight so be ready to stand if there is live music going- which there almost always is!"}
{"text":"What a cute little bar....and I mean little - one room.  It's tiny but good for a drink when you're walking around Old Town Scottsdale.  The bartender was friendly and attentive and the decor was cute and typical of a saloon. They have a little area for musicians and a few tables, plus a bar.  It's a great little stop for a quick drink."}
{"text":"A solid, dark, cool, dive bar. In the cowboy part of old Scottsdale. They had a live musician in the middle of the day, which was cool."}
{"text":"Had so much fun and this local dive bar! We stayed close by at the Saguaro resort and we were looking for a place to listen to some live country music. So, we jumped on our trusty Yelp app and found the Rusty Spur. Cheap drinks, a packed house, and some great live country music...and dancing! it made for the perfect night out in old town Scottsdale. If/when we return to the area we will make sure to stop in here again.  We got here around 730 and definitely beat the entire crowd haha but by around 930/10 it was packed  The band takes request and they also make sure to let the crowd know that they take tips haha it's well worth it though!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall is a sweaty gem! The bartender sings on the mic to live back up  while he slings drinks and he's got a decent voice ! Full of trashy stuff to look at all over the room plastered to the walls and bizarre stools to sit on and take pictures- I give this place a huge thumbs up"}
{"text":"RUSTY SPUR  is the best!!  hands down!! TRULY a  classic!!  Hopping from one Scottsdale iconic institution to another is great fun! I purposely used the word \"institution\" because it's great but it fits right in with GREAT DIVE!!"}
{"text":"Love this place in Old Town, especially when the horse comes to visit on Saturday Afternoon."}
{"text":"On 4/1/15 after spring training game came here for music and food. Waitress said we could order food from another establishment since it was past 4:00 pm.  Manager/Owner Cussed us out and flipped  us off!  We only did what the waitress suggested. Stay away from this place!! We are mature ladies who live in Scottsdale. Will never come her again !! Absolutely floored and disgusted by bartender behavior. Other patrons ran to our rescue by this owner/manager behavior."}
{"text":"Love this place any day of the week. Wings are spicy and the music is old school cowboy-Love it!"}
{"text":"Well, as I am originally from Scottsdale but now live in Oklahoma, I really feel at home in this bar when I go back to visit.  I can hang out in 'Old Town' Scottsdale but still listen to some good Red Dirt music while sipping beer and memorizing license plates (its a habit).  Hell, they even played \"Them Boys From Oklahoma Roll Their Joints All Wrong\".  Never thought I'd hear that one outside OK or TX...  The spur has that small bar feel that is getting harder to find these days.  The people that work the door and the bar were awesome!  Great country bar feel but watch for Scottsdale PD when stumbling down the street afterward."}
{"text":"Awesome little cowboy saloon very small great live music grab your boys and take a motorcycle ride down to Old Town invisi trustees forgot to take a picture on one of the funny butt bar stools"}
{"text":"The Toucan Sam routine somehow led us to the Rusty Spur. Wandering around Old Town Scottsdale, we detected a whiff of barbecue smoke that was hard to locate. Nonetheless, we were due for a cold beer, spotted some characters smoking outside of this bar, heard the live music, and trotted on in.  The crowd was a real mixed bag which made for some great people-watching. The dictionary definition of \"Sweaty Betty\" was cutting a rug to the country western sounds of the Psychobilly Rodeo Band. The band was infinitely entertaining and did not spare us commentary on its disdain for Kenny Chesney and other feel-good country-pop monstrosities.  Best of all, our need for edible smoke was satisfied since they sell beef jerky at the bar. We chowed down on some Mesquite Black Canyon Jerky, swaggled our brewskis, tapped our feet, and soaked up the party atmosphere of this fun little cowboy bar."}
{"text":"If you are making a night out in Old Town, whether you're a tourist or local this is the place to go to get that real high-end-cowboy-western-rattlesnake-desert-cactus-boots-ten-gallon-stetson-down-home feel.  Beer, grub & music are all great.  Get there early if you want a seat. Don't plan on chit-chatting because this place is popular, crowded and noisy . . . but oh sooooo fun!"}
{"text":"I am young, filipino and I don't listen to country. I still had a blast here. I work in physical therapy so I am always the youngest when I go out with co-workers. We finally got to visit here and I must say it was a good time. The bartender was awesome and made the drinks super strong. We went when there was a guy on a banjo playing country covers promoting his cd. He was hilarious going back n forth with the audience, he knows how to entertain a crowd. So much random, cool things hanging on the wall, which gives it a nice western saloon ambience. The place was packed so we just pulled up and shared a table with a kind couple of snowbirds who regularly come to this bar. Had some great drinks with great conversation, just how I like it. Not sure if I would go here with people my own age (20's) but it was fun with my 40+ friends."}
{"text":"Best place to get a drink.  But the bartender that night wasn't very pleasant.  Very short and not even a smile or thank you for the tip."}
{"text":"Tourist trap, but I guess you knew that.  I ordered the Cowboy Burger with onion rings for lunch. I'm not sorry to say this, but the burger was dry and no seasoning, the bun was fresh, rings were re-heated and extra brown/burnt (change the fry oil).  Spent the next hour on the crapper.  The hospitality was great with good service. Just go there for the music and drinks and you'll be fine.  YYMV!"}
{"text":"The oldest bar in Scottsdale. Little hole, was surprised they had Schlitz. Men can drink while the women shop."}
{"text":"Old Town Scottsdale revolves around this place.  If you visit, have a drink, late night bar hop and enjoy."}
{"text":"Horrible service, we are on vacation... middle of the day, we heard from everyone how cool it is and we must go, we show up just to get a drink, the place is empty maybe 10 people in there, 15 mins go by no hi so service no water nothing, the server saw us but didn't bother,  she went to chat with the bartender,  then a caucasian couple comes in and gets service right away  I guess she is the first server who doesn't need tips. We walked out, we don't need a side of hate with our drinks."}
{"text":"Not a country music fan, but somehow I still like this place... (they play some classic rock occasionally too).  Live music most nights & reasonable drink prices keep this place consistently busy. Also a killer location in old town for bar hopping. Try Old Town Tavern if you need a break from the action."}
{"text":"The biggest tiniest bar in Scottsdale!!!  Gotta love this bar.  Its off the beaten path but worth the stop!  I've been to this place a couple times and its always been a start to a great night.  I remember making a stop on a Santa Crawl and the crowd seemed a little shocked that 20+ Santas were taking up what little space was left.  They have live music and the drinks are reasonable.  Check out this great bar on your next bar hopping excursion!"}
{"text":"Rusty Spur has been a local watering hole for a long long time. It's a tiny place that locals & Tourist come to for after dinner entertainment. Has live band nightly, going till 12:30 every night. Staff is great !!! A nostalgic place in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Be sure not to miss it."}
{"text":"Okay  so Im a tourist! Stopped in here on Monday  the NCAA BB Championship game  was on  talked to a couple locals  and bartender and   asked  them  where to eat and watch the rest of the game  at halftime ,  they  all gave us some  good suggestions .  The bartender didn't  recommend  his own place   Not sure  if they  even served food ????   but some  reviewers said that they do  again  I'm puzzled a bit   but  the place was warm and friendly  and the people were  nice  so il give them an extra star"}
{"text":"One of the best, least pretentious hole-in-the-wall bars in Scottsdale. Crowd is a good mix of laid back 40-60 somethings with a few 20-30 year-olds mixed in.  Always live redneck music and it's usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Great bar, great staff, great music, great location, everything about the Rusty Spur is second to no other bar. The Rusty Spur also attracts tourist from all over the globe and it's a fun crowd. Highly recommend making the Rusty Spur your watering hole in Scottsdale AZ."}
{"text":"A bar after my own heart.   After an evening out at a Yelp event a few of us decided to wander over to the Rusty Spur (and close it down on a Tuesday). Ahh I walk in and I feel much removed from the posh pretentious hype that is many locations in Old Town Scottsdale. Jimmy the singing bartender can do up a Cash song like no other. And the guitarist/singer on stage that night was great. Apparently they have live music EVERY night....I like that!  I am going to have to check it out when the Phychobilly Rodeo Band plays there on the weekend."}
{"text":"Best bar in Scottsdale!! Old west style!!"}
{"text":"For what this is, this place is awesome! It's a dive bar with a country music band.  Or at least it was when I went.  No cover to get in. It's small and cozy, but the people were friendly and the ages ranged from twenty somethings all the way up to people in their 50s/60s. The band was really good too!  Worth stopping in for a drink or two."}
{"text":"Have never eaten here but what a fun place for late night drinks. Definitely go for a stop while bar hopping. Super small with a band but just a fun place. Has that \"Wild Wild West\" feel. Mixed crowd. Everyone from young 20's to an older crowd. Watch out though - There's this one really tall meat head who just wears over-all's.  He gets belligerently drunk, is rude and like to starts fights. He's considered \"trash\" from where I come from. Wish the bar wouldn't let him back in every weekend. Just stay away from him, other then that the bar is great. You don't see that back home in the tri-state area."}
{"text":"Really good live country music in a tiny setting. Too many tables crammed in front of a one-man stage.  Walls cluttered with old license plates and funny signs (\"You look like I need a drink,\" etc.) Great green and red chile tamales (\"Phoenix's best\" according to the menu. I won't argue.)  Nice mix of locals (cowboy hats and at the bar) and tourists (shorts and Ts, at the tables.) This kind of place reassures you that Scottsdale still hasn't been spoiled."}
{"text":"Alex is amazing. But don't you dare order some Thing stupid like a lemon drop (which I did) or f-Ing moscato. Order a damn beer for the love of it... or whiskey, which I do t have the balls for. Just come on and be easy. It's a small bar with one bartender."}
{"text":"I met some old friends there.  There is live music, which is good, but way too loud if you are trying to have a conversation.  The place is TINY!  The bartender was rude and uninterested.  The food was mediocre and greasy.  Maybe a better late night place rather than lunch."}
{"text":"Live music, laid back and - if you're lucky-  room to dance a bit by the band. Some nights it's jam packed and you can hardly get through the door, other nights it's nice to just sit and enjoy your beer. Sometimes it's a very entertaining show with bartender participation, other times is more mediocre. No matter how the place swings - on the busy side or more mellow - it's a fun time. I've only had basic beer and some well drinks here, but I like the beer selection. I was a little put off walking in there for a bachelorette party when we got dirty looks for being dressed up, but the staff was still nice to us (the patrons gave us the stink eye).  Love the bar stools with the big bums - they make for some good photo ops!"}
{"text":"This is a fun novelty place. The food was meh and the server was unimpressive. She looked like she was not in a good mood. The place however was interesting and there was live music in the middle of the day on a Tuesday so that was enjoyable. Been there, done it now I don't think I would go back for the food or the service."}
{"text":"Had fun two stepping here on a Saturday night to an amazing band. Fun fun fun. Great crowd and great service at the bar."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a beer before a spring training baseball game.  It is right in the middle of Old Scottsdale so it does cater to tourists.  Despite that, it has an authentic feel to it.  Next year when in town I'll probably stop by at night when they have music."}
{"text":"WOW, I'd read that this place was small. They weren't joking! Love the front door. My husband at 6'2 peeked over to see how busy it was and the singer shouted out come on in, the water's fine. LOL. We had one beer each, a local IPA that unfortunately wasn't great, not at fault of the bar. While busy, a group of locals gave up a seat at the bar for me and they were great to speak to. The barstools are hilarious and of course we got photos. We were here around 6pm on a Tuesday and it was packed full. I'd hate to see it at midnight!"}
{"text":"My favorite dive bar in old town. No BS. Straight shooting bartender with live music. Sit down, chill out and have several drinks. Uptight pretentious folks --- keep walking!!!"}
