{"text":"I used to live in southern CA and knew all about great Asian food, particularly Vietnamese Pho Noodles, and was surprised to find this place in Gastonia advertising Pho. Let me start off by saying if you want great Vietnamese food then seek out a place where Vietnamese people are actually in the kitchen preparing your food. Having said that this place serves terrible, overpriced Pho Noodles...and I mean really terrible...Maybe Charlotte has \"real\" Vietnamese food but I have yet to eat anywhere in Gastonia that impressed."}
{"text":"Good japanese menu selection and Vietnamese pho.

I go there for lunch once a week.  They serve up generous portions fast, and I am in and out of there in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I love that this restaurant is right around the corner from my house!! Before I became vegan, being faced with fast food options and not wanting to get out of the car this was my go to place because they have a drive through which is super convenient. I like to call ahead because of my special order a get my vegetable entree made without  butter with and they always oblige. I believe it went under new management about a year ago and the staff there now is super friendly and always able to help me. Make sure you get one of their reward cards because after you purchase 9/10 entrees, the next one's free."}
