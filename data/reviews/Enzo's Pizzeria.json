{"text":"Excellent pizza with a fresh taste and ingredients. Made to order while we waited. Very good side salads as well. Staff was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta dishes are awesome. And the garlic knot bread will have you eating until you burst. The you will order some to take home."}
{"text":"Everyone was very friendly. The location was on great right off I85. Pizza was ok I had pepperoni, but what won me over were the hot wings."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on numerous occasions and had always had wonderful service and wonderful food.  Good service and food on last several trips"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. It looks and tastes like real people made it (versus the chains with the pizza machines).

Wings are also tasty. They have a weekly special where you can get a large pizza and 12 wings for like $15, but I forget which night of the week it is. 

They also have an expanded Italian menu, but we've only had the pizza and wings. 

Bottom line, you should skip the chains and support this tasty local eatery."}
{"text":"Unless you prefer your Chicken Parm Sub to be made with cheap frozen chicken patty that is tasteless I suggest you avoid eating at Enzo's. Atleast the waitress realized the problem and did not charge me for the meal. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I enjoy indulging at Enzo's typically for lunch. I've had several good things on the menu. I've had their calzones and New York style pizza quite tasty I might add. Most recently I tried the Spaghetti with Meatballs which was very good and a huge portion too.  My only reservation is the time it takes to place a Togo order if they are busy."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  I've eaten at really good pizzerias in New York and New Jersey, and Enzo's is as good as any of them.  I've not had a dish from there that I didn't like.  We usually get take-out, and they are quick and friendly getting orders out.

So glad this place opened up in our little town!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh with authentic ingredients. We always order a large cheese pizza with extra cheese. My husband is from NYC so the pizza here reminds him of home. The garlic parmesan chicken wings are great with real garlic cloves. Overall, always a great dinning and takeout experience."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have found to get authentic Italian pizza in NC since I have left south Florida.  This place is a small Italian joint in Gastonia that has awesome food for even better prices.  They recently raised their prices and are still more competitive then some of the other Italian places around.  My mother lives close to here and we get salads and slices of pizza for lunch.  Great salads!  I mean when I pay $8-$10 for a salad I usually expect a nice sized portion with fresh ingredients.  This place does exactly that! And for less!  The slices are hot and fresh and the pizzas are reasonably priced for the whole family. II would put this up with some of my favorite pizza places in my home town where NY style pizza is perfected (since all of the snow birds decided to retired down there and open up an NY italian place) The staff is friendly and this is my go to pizza place.  I have driven from Mount Holly to \"deep\" Gastonia to order a pie from Enzo's.  Its well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I had the create your own pizza with sundried tomatoes and fresh basil. It was fantastic. (I'm also from NY) The side salads also were made with romaine lettuce, not iceberg. I really enjoyed it with the honey mustard dressing. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Very good authentic NY style thin crust pizza and knots. People working there and owner we're super friendly taking care of us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love going to this place.  I love the relaxed atmosphere here and everyone is always so courteous and personable.  

I love getting the Stromboli from here, they are so delicious.  I always have to buy four one for each person in my home."}
{"text":"My wife who is from Brooklyn, NY and we both enjoy the pepperoni or just cheese. My taste on pizza is different, my home town pizza was Northern Indiana but Italian family run. I don't like any of the veggys nor sausage. veggys too bland and taste like they just came out of can on black olive and mushroom, onion and green peppers dont get cooked and many times the pie is completely covered in onion pieces. I have yet to find a great pizza with great veggys in the entire region.

You can walk in and buy a slice of pie just like in the big city, pre-made pies with various toppings are in a glass storage/show case. They can also add topping to choice on the pre-made cheese pie.

Dine in is quaint, there are some booths and tables too, desserts, and an expanded dinner menu.

Bottom line, go there, the food is very good.

PS: The sausage is not to my taste, not the Italian sausage that I'm used to which is bulk and more flavorful than the in casing and sliced bland sausage they use. Could be the difference between Chicago and New York Italian sausage."}
{"text":"I ordered stuffed shells, my bf ordered the supreme pizza, large. Short list:

Pros: Oven cooked foods.



Cons: 
- hospitality leaves the servers when closing time approaches.
-overpriced
-witnessed kitchen staff dropping pans and pots and just sitting them back up on the counter (WHY DIDNT WE RUN?)
-food poisoning

My boyfriend and I came in at 8:20ish, they said they weren't take orders anymore (over the phone). I had called ahead to see if they were open because we were parked outside looking at a closed sign, at 8:20. 40 minutes before they were supposed to close. 

They grudgingly let us in but we should have just left.

I was excited about the menu but when I asked the cashier questions she was short an aggravated with me. All the kitchen staff were loudly complaining that they were closed. Again, should have left.

I've had terrible stomach cramps all day, along with vomiting and diarrhea. After looking at WebMD and seriously contemplating the ER, I get a text from my boyfriend saying he's been considering urgent care for the exact same reason. 



I guess that's what you get for eating somewhere they don't want to serve you."}
{"text":"The BEST spot in Gastonia for New York style pizza. My family orders from here at least once a week. We only had a problem once with our crust. The lady over the phone told us there was a new cook, the next time we ordered the pizza was on the house. The only other bad thing I would say is that if you eat inside be prepared to hear all kinds of idle banter between the counter lady & the cooks. Otherwise, great pizza!"}
{"text":"I had a off menu and i tasted great but I looks like it may be under new (less ethnic) management and I'm not sure if it's going to drop down to level quality that seems to thrive in NC.  But my first meal with them was good and I hope they keep up the work."}
{"text":"This is awsome just moved to gastonia and found this place great friendly people and service a must try"}
{"text":"I recently  got a pepperoni pizza from Enzos and I was totally disappointed because it was not good. The pizza was soggy not even putting it in the oven didn't helped in anyway. The store was clean but in MY opinion soggy pizza was yuck. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"To be in a strip mall outside of a walmart this place is very surprising. I have ate here twice in the same week due to working in the area and what a treat, the pizza is awesome and very reasonably priced and they also have a great priced lunch menu."}
{"text":"Traveling on 85 north and decided to stop based on reviews. This place is close to highway and very delicious NY style pizza in a NY pizzeria style restaurant. Casual, fast eating with good fresh food. Pasta good, too."}
{"text":"Great pizza & stromboli!! Always consistent, good service and good prices. If you want \"real\" pizza then this is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The place was empty minus one take out order waiting. As were looking at the menu and deciding something caught my attention that did not look right in the kitchen.
Any time you put me in a situation where I can see the kitchen my natural instinct is to watch my food being prepared. Its built-in to me and there's nothing I can do to change it. It's self preservation, and this occasion was no different. I look for cleanliness, hair nets, gloves, things that are against code, flagrant violations that could make someone sick etc, because I am the one about to eat it!
From my vantage point I could see 2 guys. The cook, the younger of the 2 had on gloves and a black ball cap with white striping on the seams. He was running the grill. The other man was in a white apron, he had no gloves, no hair restraint, He never washed his hands while I was present. But he did have a drink cup stashed above the doorway that he would pass by, reach up and grab it, take a drink, and go right back to work. That's a small red flag, but red none the less.
Then he comes back out to the counter and pulls out a cell phone, uses it, puts it away, pulls it out, uses is again, puts it away (still bare hands) then raises his right hand and coughs into it. Then, without washing his hands OR putting on gloves, he proceeds to serve food onto a plate for another customer. Cell phones are filthy dirty. We use them everywhere and handling one in a food prep situations is dangerous. Just to paint this picture for you the reason you have to use a glove on him food that is already prepared is because there will be no cooking between that time and the time you eat it to keep the temperature high enough to kill germs so whatever he has touched is on your food and nothing will kill it before you eat it. That is why gloves are required. If you are cooking in back you are allowed to handle meat etc in bare CLEAN hands, but after it's cooked, rules change.
When it comes to hair restraints anyone in the food area EVERYONE in a food prep area, working or not, manager, whoever, has to have one. No exceptions. Walking through it or working in it. Doesn't matter, everyone must cover Head or even Beards. ALL THE TIME.

At this point I already know I am not eating. I may be ok with drink violation but you are not coughing nasty hands while using a filthy cell hone you are NOT feeding me.
You should always let someone in charge know before you go online and hammer their business. They usually appreciate the chance to fix the issues, and I've had some remake food for me in my view after washing up. Being proper and trying to avoid damaging a business I was going to speak to the manager before I left.
When the food was brought and put on the table I have to tell you, it looked wonderful! I really wanted to eat it but I could not. I started to try to talk to the waitress she told me she was in charge of the front, when I insinuated that I had a problem with cleanliness, she became defensive. So I asked again for the manager or owner She said she would get him, but he walked out of the kitchen in behind the counter (without hair net) and she says there he is. She goes to get him, but instead of asking him to talk to us, she took him in the back, and in the time they were gone I'm assuming he was prepped to come deal with a problem customer instead of what I was hoping to do for him.

When he came to the table to speak with me, he already look very perturbed. My instinct was to diffuse the situation so what I tried to do was let him know that I was trying to help him by letting him know why I didn't want my food and what had happened so that he could correct it. In m day that would've been a welcome gesture, especially considering the way people are putting everything on the Internet. Things like this is can have such a bad effect on the business. I would much rather deal with it then and appreciate the customer, or even remake the food to accommodate. Really whatever it took the customer IS ALWAYS RIGHT.
Evidently not at Enzo's.
So just right off the bat I said hi, and the manager and he said yes what is the problem? I asked if he was the manager, he said \"what is the problem, I am\" So I simply told him that I had seen people without hair nets repairing the food in the kitchen and before I could say anything about the gloved hands he immediately became defensive. Denied anyone had done so, said he was all over them managing them properly (without a hair net on I guess) So I tried again and I reached my hand up to point to the gentleman who came back out in view, the one who had coughed in his hand and played with his cell phone and then went back to touching food that was about to be served, and he interrupted me again and told me I should not point.. I told him I was trying to help him by letting him know, and he was simply on offense from then on out. He did not want to hear it, told me there were 5 guys back there and I had no idea what i was saying about anyone"}
{"text":"If you're going to try Enzo's, you've got to try one of their pizzas, stromboli, pasta, or all 3!

I've had their take-out, but this was my first time dining in. The place is clean, the staff is nice, and the food is delicious! I originally ordered a pasta off the main menu, but it costs extra to add chicken ($2.95) or shrimp ($3.95) to the pasta dishes that I wanted (Penne Primavera or Penne Vodka Style, $9.95 each). Apparently no other meat options are available for adding to the pasta dishes....Then, I noticed on the Daily Specials menu that Chicken Piccata sounded intriguing AND already contained chicken for $10.95. Well shoot, that's a dollar saved, and made me feel better about my choice, so of course I changed my order asap! The downside is that they only have spaghetti, penne, and fettuccine noodles to choose from. I wish they had more options for pasta. All pasta dishes come with 3 Garlic Knots, which are incredibly amazing in all their buttery glory.  The Chicken Piccata came with one piece of chicken breast, capers the size of edamame, and roasted red peppers, bathed in lemon butter sauce. It's enough to share between 2 people, or if you're starving, it will definitely fill you up. I enjoyed the dish, but I wish there was another piece of chicken included.

I think my boyfriend had the best meal between the two of us. He had the Italian Style Stromboli, which included sausage, bell pepper, onions, mozzarella cheese, and a side of marinara sauce for $7.55. I LOVED it. It's a huge, super cheesy Stromboli that is rolled with perfectly cooked dough. I just had one bite and felt like I had gone straight to Heaven! Next time, I'm ordering a Stromboli instead of pasta!

The food here is fantastic. I just wish they had more options in terms of pasta."}
{"text":"Best Pizza, wings and service in town! Pasta and Stromboli are fresh and delicious. We go there several times a month."}
{"text":"We had the mushroom pizza and the penne a la vodka.  I gotta say that we were a little disappointed to see canned mushrooms on the pizza and what appeared to be pre-cut frozen chicken in the pasta.  Otherwise, the flavors of both were delicious!  If I go back, I'd order just the cheese pizza.  It had a great flavor!"}
{"text":"First off, terrible customer service! We had just walked in to Enzo's and at the counter a couple and the lady at the register were arguing over pricing a special!! Omgsh it was bad y'all! I seriously thought it was going to escalate to something physical. We were standing there for at least 3 min listening to raised voices going back and forth, waiting for our order to be taken. We almost walked out. Don't businesses know how important customer service is!?! She needs to long gone. At least the owner/ manager should have apologized to them and us for that incident. We ordered a large Hawaiian pizza. It was alright. Not the best. I definitely wouldn't call it NY style. The crust was subpar. We were told it comes with bacon but there was hardly any.  First and last time at Enzo's."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a bite while traveling through Gastonia. Got the lunch special consisting of 2 slices of cheese pizza and sweet tea. The tea was excellent and pizza was NY style - large slices with oregano melted into the cheese. The pizza was very good and the price wasn't bad, either. I'd definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for a small town pizza place. Genuine ingredients and flavorful toppings. Excellent price for what we got. Would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"OMG! Pizza fab! The cannoli is SO good. Finally found a place that knows how to make them!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here one time. The pizza was ok. They have strange hours and never stay open late like most pizza places.  It pricey and doesn't have much of a taste. It is not all that authentic. It is ordinary and boring to me."}
{"text":"I love Enzo's! I have been there about 10 times and every time is as good as the previous. I am never disappointed. I have had pasta dishes and pizza dine-in and take out. I prefer the pizza to go and reheated at home but I am like that with most pizza places. I live about 45 minutes from there and try to get back once a month or so for either lunch or dinner. It is an easy, affordable, no frills pizza joint like we had back home in NY. I usually have the pasta dishes. I think I have tried about 5 or 6 of them and all fantastic. The garlic knots are super yummy as well as the Golden Italian salad dressing!"}
{"text":"Dining by myself, I ordered the 10\" small pizza with my preferred toppings - pepperoni, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes. T was delicious !  Excellent NY style pizza. I would heartily recommend Enzo's! The lady who waited on me, and I believe she is the owner, took excellent care of me. She refilled my Diet Coke about 6 times. I left full and satisfied for ~$11 plus tip. 

I only wish they sold beer, but she said they wanted to maintain a family atmosphere and I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Great pizza in Gastonia!!!!  Found by chance... Near the Walmart on West Franklin... There are real Italians ans Anew Yorkers.  The pizza was done to perfection.  Product is the best imported from Italy.  Lasagna made in house by Enzo... And people, the parlic knots...OMG...the garlic knots.  I want to buy mortdatella and slap it in between and make a sandwich.  I bought a dozen for an emergency carb fix.  Can't wait to eat through their menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Only  giving 4 stars because the dining area is small, crowded, and chaotic. If reviewing the food only, I'd give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the West Gastonia rough.  So of the most authentic New York style pizza around.  Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place. 

The smell alone walking is reminds me of home where Italian Food is a staple. 

The pizza is great. I like a thinner crust but I can't fault the flavor. Their pastas have always been amazing every time we've gotten them. 

Garlic rolls are addictive."}
{"text":"I haven't been in NC in two years, but we used to eat here all the time. I can't say enough about this place, the food deserves 100 stars. Friendly, clean, it's the only thing I miss about North Carolina besides our friends."}
