{"text":"Best Italian food in Cleveland. Family owned for decades. Owner is also head chef and makes sure everything comes out perfect."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten! We have been there multiple times and they never cease to amaze us. The waitresses treat us like family and make us feel welcome.  The food is great I recommend the ravioli."}
{"text":"Traditional Italian for an excellent price. My wife and I have popped in a few times to find a relatively light crowd. Don't know why. The food is very good. Salads are fine. Service is very good and it's quiet. Don't overlook this place for good food."}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely delicious!  However, the appetizer you could have passed on (we ordered the shrimp/special appetizer) and the wine was very dry and pricey for their house wine.  I would go back for the pizza, though, hands down and is deserving of a try!"}
{"text":"The food was all very delicious. The bruchetta, calamari, eggplant parmesan, chicken parmesan was terrific. 

I wonder why all the restaurants in the area are packed, and this place was not. It should be, based on the terrific food."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot in my heart for longstanding businesses. We hadn't yet tried Violante's so it was time. We walked in around 6pm on a Saturday night and there were only 3 people in the place. Meanwhile, the parking lots of Burntwood Taven and Hunan at the Falls (on either side of Violante's) were packed. I got a little nervous. Interior is dated and not very comfortable. Hard, wooden booths and tables.  Service was odd. Our waitress was nice to us but I heard her complaining in the kitchen. O also heard the kitchen staff drop a few f-bombs while prepping food.  The time it took to receive our food was a long time. Too long.  And for what reason?  They weren't crowded.  The food?  Not good, sorry to say. The Fettuccine Alfredo was bland and tasted a little off.  My baked penne was equally bland.  The dinner salad was nice and chilled and a generous portion.  The Italian dressing was just okay.  Nothing great.  Dinner for 3 was $70 before tip.  I get the feeling this place is resting on its laurels and the owner doesn't care like he used to.  No personality, no nothing.  Sorry, but I can prepare a better meal than Violante's. At least serve garlic butter with your toasted Italian bread at the table, or serve some fresh-grated Pecorino Romano at the table instead of filling a shaker bottle with generic Parmesan cheese.  When a restaurant is not crowded on a Saturday night, that pretty much says it all."}
{"text":"Very small place with okay food. The waitress was kind of slow. So was the food. The food was also in small portions for the price. I know this won't happen to anyone else bit a blind man accidentally put his walking stick in my salad and they wouldn't give me another salad"}
{"text":"My husband loves their pizza.  The owner lived down the street from his parents when he was a kid, so it has some nostalgia.  

I think it OK, but not the best Italian I've had.  I've tried a few dishes and they all relatively taste the same. 

I like their Italian dressing and they have HUGE meatballs.  I always order a side of meatballs to go with our pizza so I can cut it up and put it on my slices.

Decor leaves much to be desired, and we always have the same waitress who is good but not the happiest person you've ever seen."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment very good food had takeout tonight huge servings quality food good spices I got the pasta Diablo with chicken plenty a chicken lots of food and I for tomorrow which I like right next to establishment that isn't really enough to shake a stick at the quality of food so yeah good food go check them out peace out"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Even the bread was phenomenal. It's a small place so it has a cozy feel to it. Wine can be corked and taken home. We will definitely be coming back. Even the husband said, \"Nice pick.\"

Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is due to service not being \"top notch.\" Waitress was very nice but didn't acknowledge us right away. Also, when we got wine she didn't pour it for is. She was still good but didn't wow us."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great sauce. My veal parm was superb. Shrimp appetizer was very tasty. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"One of the most incredible Italian Restaurants I have ever been to!! The meatballs are to die for, the chicken pesto pizza is unbelievable, and the rest of the menu is off the chart. What an experience every time!!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. If you like Italian not just pizza but authentic delicious Italian THIS IS THE PLACE.  I always thought if you lived in Cleveland and want Italian got little Italy. Not anymore........
Violates has been opened for 46 years and is a second generation restaurant. All the food is made per order so if you want to eat and run then you will not be happy. This is old school. Order a bottle of wine have a salad and share a huge meal. As for the pizza there are only a few descent pizza places in Cleveland. Thank god this is down the street. The crust is like a pastry and not soggy. NOT SOGGY. Plenty of cheese sausage and pepperoni. Nothing was skimped. So much food for $41 we have dinner for tomorrow night. If you just drive by stop relax and enjoy. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great family restaurant.casual"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in the Chagrin Valley! Authentic and homemade food in a quiet, relaxing environment. I usually order the chicken and eggplant parmesan combo. They also offer generous portions."}
{"text":"I think this place is so good. I prefer take out to actually going in and sitting down. The atmosphere is lacking and it's decor is old school and not recently updated. Regardless, if you can make someone keep coming based on your take-out quality I think you have a winner. I always get the Veal Parmigiana. My family likes their pizza. It's all good authentic Italian food (my favorite kind).  Next I'm going to try their combo parms - just for something different."}
{"text":"Really good old school Italian. Everything is so good. Older restaurant but very clean. Everything is made to order you even hear them pounding your veal. Service is good. I definitely recommend"}
