{"text":"This restaurant needs a professional to review the decor, table set up, employees, and menu.  

The decor is confusing.  On the outside there is a lovely fountain and well kept awning but on the inside it looks like a living room with restaurant tables instead of couches.  The bar is cramped and they insist on keeping all of the tables up even when they have a band which doesn't allow room for dancing.  The employees would rather sit down and chat with their friends than work.  The menu is huge which means premade, frozen, and powdered food.  They should really cut back on the menu and offer quality items.  The problem with this is that their pricing doesn't reflect the quality.  Everything is over priced from the room temp iced tea which melts the ice in a few seconds to the instant mashed.  

Do not bother coming to this place unless you need your wallet and colon cleansed."}
{"text":"Teddy's has really dropped over the years.  It's old and dirty, food is substandard.  I've gone here several times and it's always been poor quality service and food...go back to the old ways, food and service, clean the place, bet new table cloths, carpet....it's sad that after a restaurant makes it name all to many times it drops at that point and that's what happened to Teddy's."}
{"text":"Teddy's is one of those restaurants that tries really hard to appear classy, but when it comes down to it, they're just serving you canned corn.

The menu prices are pretty steep unless you get the special (which I did.)  I ordered the stuffed porkchop and it came with salad, mashed potatoes, and corn for $11.95.  The porkchop itself was pretty tasty, but the stuffing was insanely salty. I couldn't bring myself to even finish it. The potatoes also tasted powdered, but the gravy was yummy.

My boyfriend ordered steak tips marinated in garlic soy sauce. They were served with a salad and mashed potatoes for $17.95.  Now, usually when you marinate something, you DISCARD the marinade after it's all said and done. These tips were actually served IN the marinade. Needless to say, his meal was unbelievably salty as well. 

The service was good and our waitress was very nice. The dessert cart looked amazing, but we did not partake.

All in all, this place just isn't worth the money. The sub-par food is too expensive and, honestly, I cannot stress the saltiness of it all enough. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could.  I don't know if the good reviews are all from people who have never left Irwin, or those who are used to eating reheated frozen meals or just FAKE, but this place is BAD BAD BAD.  My mom wanted to eat here for her birthday when I came in from out of town, so my husband, mother, and grandma and I went here for lunch.   From what I understand, Teddy's used to be a nice place to eat, but since the owner has passed away the quality has GONE DOWNHILL to something that is almost inedible.  The vegetable soup was canned vegetables in canned broth; the salad was 100% iceberg lettuce.  Even my grandmother said the salmon didn't taste right.  I'm pretty sure the pumpkin pie gave granny and I  food poisoning.  On a regular day I wouldn't recommend eating at Applebee's, but it's right up the road, and you at least know what you're getting.  Pasqualino's is also in that area, and that place at least didn't make me sick.  Don't waste your time; money here, please!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and it was great food.  It was pretty busy there, but we had no wait for a table.   Waitress spilled water on my wife once and almost a second time as well as she spilled dressings at the next table..

Plenty of food for the money in my opinion.."}
{"text":"Prices are decent, poor quality food (I ordered the grilled chicken salad). Decor reminds me of 1990."}
{"text":"I gave teddy's 3 stars, because the food is really good, probably one of the best turkey dinners at a restaurant around, but the prices are fairly high.

Also, it looks ok on the outside, but inside it's kind of dumpy.  They need to do a serious remodel of the place.  Plus I where I could see in the kitchen the one day, and it looked clean, but was definitely outdated as well.  

Everyone that works there is friendly, so that's another plus.  Really, I'd give it 4 stars if they'd update the place, and 5 if the food wasn't so expensive."}
{"text":"Guess what I had to eat last night at Teddy's??  YEP....Chicken Devonshire!  I have never seen this on any other menu at any other restaurant.  It is so dang good.  I'm telling you...how could you go wrong??  Chicken with a delicious cheese sauce with 3 strips of yummy bacon!  I had the rice pilaf and the green beens too.  This place is still one of my favorites.  I hope it's always there."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a horrible experience today.  As our salads were served we usually trade stuff with each other.  My wife found a wet paper towel in hers.  We would have left but had no time to reorder somewhere else.  The waitress said sorry and the hostess also said sorry and went to get \"fresh\" one.  I was concerned about my salad so the waitress said that the prep cooks make the salads so she had no idea how it happened.  Our main dishes took a long time to come out.  The \"stir fry\" which the waitress said was a good choice was not.  Converted rice has no taste and the chicken was dry.  No flavor to the meal.  At no time did a manager come over to check in on us.  We do not complain. We just NEVER come back and tell our friends to not also!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area and decided to try out Teddy's.  It was really warm in the dining room, sweat was pouring off of the waitress while she was waiting on us. My husband had a shrimp and chicken Alfredo that tasted like it was from a jar for $18, it was listed on their favorites menu, I don't know how anyone would ever enjoy eating that.  I had fish and when asked which vegetable I would like, I was given the options of peas or brussel sprouts, which I know would've came from a frozen box or can.  I think I would get better quality food from a fast food place."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever as you can tell from the decor inside.  It could really use a remodeling.  The menu is okay and pretty basic.  Nothing exciting.  My main course of was pretty decent but my side of rice pilaf was really bland and pretty pathetic.

A lot of the menu items come in Queen and King sizes when the king is a bit bigger with more sides.  I ordered the queen size for mine and thought that it was enough food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the original owner, Teddy, was a family friend. Unfortunately, since his passing the place has gone downhill and fast. The food is delicious and I've never had something that I didn't like to eat. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. To start, the service is terrible. The wait staff is always rude and/or aloof. On one occasion, my husband and I sat in the bar and overheard a bartender AND two separate waitresses bitching to customers about their jobs! Another time, we walked into the bar area and 5 tables were in use. All but one of the other tables was dirty...every table needed bused - dirty plates and dishes all over them! We sat at the only clean booth on the end. On this same occasion, my husband and I had ordered the special, fried shrimp and steak with two sides. We were asked if we wanted saut√©ed onions and peppers for our steak; we said sure, not knowing that we would be charged $4 each for the toppings! I mean, really. Needless to say the waitress did not EARN a good tip. Also, the atmosphere and decor is outdated and has been the same for years. I will no longer go to Teddy's despite the food being good. What a shame...."}
{"text":"Last week we went to see the Mark Passerro Open Mic/Stage event.  Mark is the guitarist for the Sweaty Betty Blues Band.  

This time we sat at the bar on the end toward the band in order to have excellent sound and visual seats.  This worked out well for us.  

We also decided to eat very lightly since the food venue is exceedly \"heavy.\"  Bar was fast and courteous.  Beer selection is abysmal however.  Poor, limited selection unless your view of life is Miller Light or something of that ilk.  Teddy's is just missing the boat on the bar issue.  Both Chardonnay's were horrid. They need to step this part of the service up a notch.  Bartender was excellent -- she was/is not given very much to work with however.  

The event (and not the food) is what the review is about.  

Excellent -- the 4 stars is about the event that Mark Passaro and friends put together for Teddy's.  Really a very nice, fun, gentile, musician filled, respectful venue.  Managed by seasoned professionals from a variety of groups.  A treat in oh so many ways.  Adequate seating -- come early to get the outside booths, and the best bar seats.  Great parking in front and on the back -- well lighted and safe.  Easy access off of 76 to 30 west.  Just a simple left and right for most people.

Band was NOT overly loud as so many become in these events.  Balanced, and visually available.  Harp folk brought their own little amplifier which was beautifully overdriven.  Fok were up and dancing.  Very nice visuals.  

The Rhythm Machine was the back group, and they were TIGHT.  TIGHT.  A true pleasure to see and watch.

Mark managed the flow of performers with a calm, relaxed, respectful hand.  Open mic nights without this special touch become obsolete in short order.  A variety of people came forth, signed in via the sign up sheet, and were welcomed.  

Lighting -- there were 5 (five) ceiling lights out above the band.  I asked if they could be turned on and was told they were burned out.  Five?  Really.  This means about a year of neglect.  The band and all the performing venues need decent light -- while I am not a fan of overheads, I am a fan of lumens.  Teddy's needs to begin thinking these venues need routine maintenance.

All this said, we will be back tomorrow for another SBBB (Sweaty Betty).  And I'll try to capture a few nice moments visually.

And this just in, I understand there is going to be another Open Mic Night tomorrow, May 11th.
