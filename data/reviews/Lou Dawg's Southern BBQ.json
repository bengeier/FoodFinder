{"text":"Food, like fashion, has a lot to do with trends. Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.  A number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic. Lately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.  On a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.  With our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...  The pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.  Side dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.  The small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.  Overall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well....ummmmm....the service was good.....pause....can anyone here tumbleweeds blowing by?.....  Had the Beef Brisket Sandwich in the hopes of getting my authentic bbq on...but alas this sandwich was not even passable...It tasted like one of those rib sandwiches you get out of the fridge at a Gas station...not even that good actually...If the Brisket was any indication of the other bbq, then they should try taking a few lessons from The Black Camel..."}
{"text":"I love Lou Dawg's. It's a great place to get a very casual meal in the King West neighbourhood. I like the fact that they smoke their meat in house and make their own BBQ sauce. The sandwiches are great although I usually add way more BBQ sauce and some hot sauce. I tried a Lou-tine the other day and while I was intrigued at the thought of poutine with pulled pork or chicken on top, I was disgusted with myself for eating such an unhealthy meal. It was good and they used proper cheese curds but I don't think I would order it again. The wings and ribs are good but the real star of the menu are the sandwiches. That's what keeps me coming back.   They used to have BBQ sauce dispensers on a side table which they have now removed, I was told because they were attracting fruit flies, but you can ask them for all the extra sauce you like. The only thing that I ordered that I didn't care for was a brownie for dessert. It was very ordinary and not very chocolatey. It tasted like it came out of a package however I was told they're made in house.   I would not recommend coming here on a first date, as the food can sometimes get messy, but it's an excellent place to eat with friends. On a final note, I've caught a couple of excellent live music performances there. A guy with a guitar playing covers, not usually my thing, but he was really good."}
{"text":"Be careful their bartender! ! When they think u r drunk they will increase your beer price !! I ordered the same beer couple times, price got higher after. Was the price whatever bartender said????"}
{"text":"If you want anything close to prompt service, I suggest you avoid this restaurant.   My fiance and I were craving BBQ over the weekend and decided to try this spot for the first time. Immediately upon entering it was clear that this is a no-fuss, seat-yourself type of restaurant, which was fine with us. We sat down at a table that hadn't yet been cleared (lots of empty beer glasses, used napkins, etc.) which again, was totally fine ...  We watched as the server attended to tables all around us, even guests that arrived after us. He handed them menus and took their drink orders. He even came to a table right beside us to grab an extra chair for another group of people and looked directly at us. Surely, we thought, he'd be over as soon as he had a free second.  Well, 15 minutes later we left. There was zero attention given to us whatsoever. Not a nod, not a smile, nothing. As we were leaving, I tried to catch the server's eye so he could maybe say something - anything - to keep us there (we really wanted BBQ!) but he just watched us leave and looked away. Epic fail. Will never be back."}
{"text":"The BBQ smell in this place is awesome! You get such a strong waft of it when stepping into the restaurant. Its a really Southern styled place with a wooden interior, love it.  After sight seeing the whole place, my partner and I took a seat and ordered the Lou Poutine which was amazing. Fries topped with the traditional gravy and cheese curds along with smoky pulled pork and a fresh helping of coleslaw! Can you as for anything better? Everything put together was such a pleasant to eat, I couldn't help myself but eat most of it. We also ordered half a rack of their famous BBQ ribs which were just as tasty with a tangy sauce and fall off the bone meat. Mmmmm. The only thing I wasn't so happy with was their dry rubbed chicken wings. It was dusted with intense seasoning but their chicken was over-cooked  and so dry I couldn't even eat it. Dry chicken and dry rub do not make a good combination - almost makes you wanna cough out dust.  Other than that, this place really made me have a stronger love for Southern foods with their juicy pulled meats and BBQs."}
{"text":"Although the inside atmosphere leaves something to be desired, the food was surprisingly delightful. We could have done without the chicken cheese chili but the Black Bean Corn salad and the pulled pork is definitely a taste-buds pleaser. The portions were hearty and with most things on the menu being under $10, Lou Dawg's definitely \"goes on to Choreography\"."}
{"text":"Lou Dawgs seems like a place that can't decide what it wants to be...a bar? a takeout place? a bank? We went to see a friend's band play.  Which in and of itself seemed strange for a takeoutish joint.  However, it totally worked and they were great!  We shared a beef brisket sandwich.  The meat was tender and flavourful, but a bit on the fatty side.  The sauces were yummy.   The weirdest part was the seemingly never ending stream of people coming in to use the ATM...it seemed like it was some sort of special ATM given the number of people using it!"}
{"text":"Lou Dawgs was perfect for what I wanted last night: a hearty stay-in take-out meal. All under $20.   On a monday night, the place was filled to the brim with drunk Jack Astors servers. Apparently, they chose Lou Dawgs for their staff party so imagine my surprise when I walk in looking like a lumberjack in my oversized flannel pyjamas to a myriad of double D's staring me in the face. I gingerly place my order at the rammed bar with a very pleasant bartender/server and step aside preparing myself to wait half a century while he tends to the boobs. Wrong! My order arrives piping hot ready to go in 5 minutes flat AND I get a \"Thank you so much for your patience\" along with it. Must be my lucky day!  On to the food. The pulled chicken was dry and needed some serious oomph. I had to douse it in hot sauce a few times. There was no slow cooked smoker loving going on with this sandwich. The beef brisket was 20% wetter due to the fatty brisket but both sandwiches were sugar sweet and needed spice. I think the trick is to ask for extra sauce on the side. The yukon gold fries were perfectly salted and plenty for a $3 small.  A little tweaking aside, this is a great option in the area since Gandhi closes at 10 and there are hardly any takeout places within those few blocks."}
{"text":"Lou dawg's is nestled in downtown Toronto. Upon entering we were greeted by the sounds of blues music, and seated ourselves near a window. We were seen by a friendly server very quickly, and we ordered our drinks and food.  The food came amazingly quickly. I would venture that it wasnt more than a 5 minute wait. I ordered a combo with pulled pork and cole slaw and fries on the side, and the rest of my party ordered the brisket combo and the Loutine. The combo meal came with a generous portion of pulled pork, a bun sliced in half so you can assemble your own sandwich without the bread getting soggy, just as much cole slaw and a ton of fries. Everything tasted hot and fresh. The fries were super crispy and delicious, the cole slaw was just as delicious (and included sunflower seeds and craisins which added a sweet touch) and the pulled pork was some of the best I've ever had. It was sweet and well textured, not overly shredded or mushy. The sauces at the table included housemad bbq sauce (smoky and regular), hot sauce and ketchup that I could swear was house made (the server insisted it wasnt, but it was definitely better than your standard heinz). My fellow diners also enjoyed their food very much. The server was friendly the whole time, and gave us tourists some suggestions of places to see before we headed out.   All in all it was an excellent meal and very decently priced."}
{"text":"Walking down King Street, my friends and I were debating between grabbing a burger at Big Smoke or Lou Dawgs. When we saw the \"$5 wings after 5pm\" sign, we were sold. Must be a Monday evening special to pull in customers since the place was completely dead.  My two friends both went with the pulled pork sandwich ($6.95) and I decided to go with the 3 Meat Slider Sampler ($9.95) which came with a slider of pulled pork, brisket and chicken. I really like variety! Unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken or brisket. They were a little too dry for my liking. The pulled pork on the other hand was quite nice. Saucy and tender.   Since the wings were only $5 for a pound and a half we ordered this to share. I thought for sure we'd have to order drinks in order to get this special. Surprisingly, there was no catch! We got the dry rub and they were decent although I don't think the seasoning was mixed very well. Some bites were better and more flavourful than others. But for $5, I'd say this is pretty darn good value!  Something that caught my eye on their menu was the deep fried pickles ($5.95). I love pickles in any form... I'm one of those people who keeps a jar of pickles in the fridge at all times for snacking. These deep fried morsels were delicious! But at 6 bucks, I'd say the price was a little steep. I could buy two whole jars of pickles with that money...  It's always a bad idea ordering food when you're starving. I just wanted everything, so I also ordered a Loutine (aka pulled pork poutine). I was surprised by how generous they were with the pulled pork and cheese. But at this point in the meal, I could only stomach a few bites. Even my friend..aka our garbage disposal couldn't put much of a dent in it. Not a reflection of the poutine though, which was decent.  Overall - an A-ok experience. Sure, nothing blew me away, but the food in general was pretty decent. Worth a visit if you're in the area but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Gotta get the pulled pork sandwich. Amazing soft roll made locally, sweet potato fries that are HUGE!! Trevor is a great host. Ask about the pilgrimage down south, where this gem of a place was born."}
{"text":"My bf really wanted pulled pork so came to Lou Dawg's to get our fix. We got there and heard it was wings night also so we got 1lb of wings for $5. With our pull pork sandwich we got a side of potato salad (which the waitress forgot about) and a coke.  Overall the only tasty thing we ate was the pulled pork sandwich. The wings and potato salad weren't that great. Service was OK up until the point where we wanted to get our bill. And to make the experience worse there were fruit flies flying around everywhere interfering with my eating haha.  I wouldn't willingly want to come back.. even thought the pulled pork sandwiches were good, I personally really hate flies annoying me when I eat."}
{"text":"The prices are low, but the food just isn't that good. The pulled pork was very bland and the coleslaw was studded with sunflower seeds and raisins. A genuine \"meh\" from me."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was great. Would give it a four but the poutine was a little bit too salty, made it difficult to get through the whole thing."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner so I frequent Lou Dawgs with irregularity.  I often walk in because I'm craving one thing, and one thing only: Pulled Pork.  The meat is delicious and their soft buns (available in white or whole wheat) are the perfect accompaniment.  That said, today's one of those spring days that feels like fall... a day where bathing suit season is the furthest thing from my mind.  And all I wanted to eat was something warm and substantial.  I wandered into Lou Dawgs thinking a sandwhich could fit the bill, when I realised \"Meaty Baked Beans\" was an option.  And then the staff recommended having that along side a bun.  Perfection.  Now I'll be there for two things, and two things only...."}
{"text":"I love going to restaurants that specialize in making just one thing because generally speaking that means that one thing is amazing!  Lou Dawg's specializes in making pulled pork, not the stringy shredded mess of boiled pork and sauce you find in other wannabe joints. I've spent a lot of time down in the south, so I've had a lot of good pulled pork before. Lou Dawg's makes a valiant attempt and is decent for a joint up in TO.  But you need to know how to order your pulled pork. If you just order the pulled pork and let them sauce it up for you, it'll either be too much sauce (soggy), or too little sauce (too porky). What you want to do is order the pork with a moderate amount of sauce and then go to the squeeze pump and adjust to suit your own taste.   If they just smoked their pork shoulder a little bit longer to get that deep flavorful smoke ring, this could easily be a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Went there the Sunday night before Labour day. Place wasn't packed, but obviously more busy than they anticipated as there was only one server, the chef seemed a little overwhelmed and they had run out of a handful of ingredients. Still the service was superb, the server cheerful and informative (never made us feel rushed) and the chef came out to personally present the poutine he made for us after our original order couldn't be completed. A+ Service, and I'm looking forward to returning on an evening when they are properly staffed."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is open until 4 am. Only drunk people would ever eat here more than once. This is a place for people who dont know southern BBQ.  The place is dirty and run down.  The pulled pork is bland and lacking in the tang one expects from southern food. No hint of cider, mustard, or even heat just the standard pulled pork sauce you can buy in the supermarket. The poutine cheese is incredibly salty as one would expect with industrial grade cheese and the fries cried \"change the oil\". All served in crappy plastic baskets with red and white checkered wax paper. Absolutely zero finesse or style in this place and by the way covering the walls with Jack Daniels posters doesnt make anything Southern.   Very small beer selection.   Loud annoying guitar wanking music (more rock than Southern) so loud you cant here people at the same table.  One of the worst meals I have had in Toronto and definitely not a place to go if you love Southern slow cooked meat. Go somewhere better, unless you are drunk and dont care."}
{"text":"The Entourage were extremely hungry when we picked Lou Dawgs as our venue.  The fact that we were hungry should mean we were going to be less discriminating with the review.  Sadly, that was not the case.  We got there around dinner time on a Sunday, and was shock to find the place deserted.  There were only one other table, and they were finishing up so we were the only table during the whole meal.  The decor was casual, what you would expect a bbq place to look like. Unfortunately, the service was not as warm or inviting as the decor.  The waitress took quite a while before acknowledging us although she didn't appear to be busy with anything in particular.  After standing around, we just sat ourselves at a table and waited for her to come by.  Our brisket sandwich, was overly saucy, to the point where we were not able to taste or feel the texture of the brisket.    The pull pork were not as saucy as the brisket, but it was dry and stringy.  We were surprise to find the portions were quite small in relation to the price. While I would not classify this as expensive, other BBQ places often have larger portions.  The sides were extras, but they served the sandwiches on a big basket, which further emphasis the smaller portion.  We ordered a poutine and found it also didn't satisfy our starch craving.  Their version had very little cheese and the gravy didn't have the thickness to coat the fries.  While the fries were hot, the gravy was not.  These cheese curd   All the sandwiches were barely room temperature when they got to the table.  Unfortunately, we were too hungry to noticed until after the meal.  The only positive on this outing were the buns that the sandwiches were served on.  Since were were not there to eat bread, this was not enough to save the meal.  Not sure if we just picked an off day to visit, or is this the new norm for this place. Based on our experience, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I went there for a takeout around 1:30. There was barely anyone there (which was ideal, because I didn't wanna wait in line for long). Ordered a pulled pork sandwich combo (chose sweet potato fries for the side)+ soda. Cost me $12ish after tax+tips.  At first I thought that's quite expensive, but after I got the food. The price seems very reasonable, because they actually give you big portions. I was very full when I finished my meal.  The pulled pork sandwich itself was OK. They taste pretty standard to me. Nothing really wows me; it taste like those pulled pork sandwich at a rib-fest. However they packed the sandwich really well.  Their sweet potato fries are AMAZING! I've tried sweet potato fries from many different places before, but I can tell you their sweet potato fries is one of the best I've ever tasted. They're cut larger than usual and looked darker rather than the orange-looking SP fries. Actually they looked not very appetizing, but taste really good!  I only saw one server/cashier and she was very nice.  The set up of the place is really nice and cozy too."}
{"text":"Went to Lou's again today and once again found it to be dissatisfying. I've come to the conclusion that this place really does southern-style food a disservice.   I ordered the breakfast burrito this time in an effort to combat a hangover. And it was just an over-sized tube of dry black beans, egg, lettuce, barely-melted Gorgonzola, and corn. According to the menu, it is meant to contain \"BBQ mayo,\" but I could detect none. It really would've helped bind the ingredients together, but instead everything just kept falling apart in my hands. The salsa that came on the side was basically just diced tomatoes and peppers--not spicy and not liquid, so you couldn't dip the burrito into it, either. The fries were fine, nothing to report, and there was again a tiny bowl of melon chunks on the side. Yawn.  Incredibly lackluster and disappointing and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Being a huge lover of the now defunct Dipalmo's, I had visions of exquisite BBQ meat and succulent secret sauce in my head while approaching  Lou Dawg's. I thought, this is what Toronto has been waiting for... I was wrong.  After peeling back the lids, I discovered some pretty nasty looking food. Going against my gut, I decided to at least try everything I ordered - since it wasn't a cheap meal at over $14. The BBQ chicken tasted like chemicals (plastic), the creamy slaw was full of dried cranberries and the baked BBQ beans looked like chili with fat chunks floating in it. The only thing I have to be thankful for is that the portions  were small. Trust me, it's a good thing."}
{"text":"I dropped in for dinner and was pleasantly surprised that the smoked wings are 1/2 price on Mondays and Wednesdays. I love smoked wings. They're made with so much more love than deep fried wings.  We tried both the dry rub and bbq style of smoked wings. Both were a disapointment.The dry rub and bbq sauce were so heavy that you couldn't taste any smokey flavour in the wings.  For sides, we had the garden salad and sweet potato mashed. The large portions are good enough to share for 3-4 people. The garden salad was good and had some tex mex powder on it too. The sweet potato mashed had so many additives that I couldn't taste the sweet potato in it. It's really a dish that's best when it's kept simple."}
{"text":"One of my co-workers suggested this place for lunch, so we went this past Friday. I like the location because it's always so lively around King and Portland. The food was decent, I've never really had a pulled chicken sandwich before so I have nothing to compare it to. The prices are very cheap considering the portions they give you. One of my co-workers had wings and it just didn't look right to me...I mean the wings looked like alien claws! LOL  If you enjoy that hickory smoke flavour on your food then you should definitely check this place out. If you're not too crazy about it, then you should pass as you're not missing much."}
{"text":"For what you pay for, this place is good. I'm no pulled pork connoisseur, but for $7 bucks you can get a stacked sandwich that will leave you reeling at the end. The pork is tender and juicy, though the braised beef sandwich at about $9 is arguably worth the extra toonie. The size \"small\" sweet potato fries on the side are good enough for 2 people to share. Really - it's huge. Even better (now I'm not sure if this is a regular thing), but that day they had \"$5 for a pound of wings after 6pm\". Of course, we waited it out and tried them. I love me some rubbed wings, and that was what we got. Also major thumbs up. Wouldn't mind if it came with some celery or carrot sticks on the side though - a whole lot of meaty brown-coloured foods in one sitting.  We swung by this place on a Wednesday late afternoon and the place was empty, but was slowly filling up by the time we left for a live comedy show set to go on there later. They also have a live music schedule, and the environment seems like a nice place to kick back and enjoy some cheap fries and beers on a weekday night. Service is friendly enough, and the place is clean and \"new-looking\", unlike your more traditional pubs and bars. There were quite a few visitors doing the takeout option, though I'd say if you're in the area, it's worth kicking back and enjoying the casual space."}
{"text":"I came to the King Street location for brunch recently and overall was disappointed. I would give the food 3 stars but bumped it down to 2 due to service and pricing.   I had the pulled pork eggs benny which was okay. Not great, but not bad either. My biggest complaint is that there was only pulled pork and an egg on one half of the English muffin. The other half was served plain with no jam or butter. This is the only place I've ever been where I've gotten a half order of eggs benny as a standard menu item. Didn't seem worth it for the $12 or so it cost.   Our server was very friendly, however service was quite slow given that there were only two parties dining in the restaurant. Our order was also very slow to arrive. This seemed to be more an issue of staff doing other tasks and neglecting the patrons in the dining area.   Overall: It was okay, but I've had better experiences at Denny's and wouldn't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the wings both hot sauce and the dry rub and were huge and delicious .   Try their house beer it's smooth and fantastic! !"}
{"text":"Their special for the week is the Mighty Loutine - Fresh Cut Fries smothered with homemade gravy (made from scratch using chicken bones smoked in-house), fresh cheese curds from Quebec and freshly slow smoked pulled pork. The gravy did have a very smoky flavour and lots of pulled pork on top of the poutine. Yummy.  We also got the dry rub chicken wings. I didn't like the wings as much though, it was very power-y with the dry rub and not much taste to it, only went I put on the sauces.  We had as well the sampler sliders - chicken, pulled pork and brisket. It was alright, nothing really special. The poutine was the best of all."}
{"text":"Im from Niagara Falls and whenever i go out for chicken wings i am a bit hesitant, I'm used to going to niagara falls, ny or buffalo where the wings are just too hard to beat.  the smoked wings at lou dawgs were hands down some of the tastiest wings I've ever had, absolutely loved them.  so big that four or five were in an entire pound, not greasy because I'm pretty sure they weren't deep fried, nice big tasty markings from the grill all over them. they were amazing  even the nachos we had were awesome, simple menu item, but its one of those things that can be made great or just \"meh\"  only problem was that the server doubled as the bartender and he was quite busy, made up for it by being friendly.    i have to go back and try more off of the menu, one of the best in toronto in my opinion.  even when you walk into the restaurant all you can smell is the smoke and spices. what a great place"}
{"text":"Looking for some BBQ on King West, Lou Dawg's is your place.  I planned a team lunch at Lou Dawg's and they were able to accomodate our reservation.  When we arrived, there was a reserved table was ready for the team of 10.  Food wise, it is your standard BBQ menu with meat galore; pork, chicken and beef.  They even had vegetarian and fish options for the non-meat eaters.  I got the option 1 which is one meat + two sides - beef brisket with sweet potato mash and coleslaw.  The beef brisket was soft and saucy; I really liked the sides.  My option 1 came with a mini baguette; it accompanied the meal quite well.  Service was a bit slow considering it was a Monday.  Good thing is they are open late for the clubbing crowd (till 4am).  I will be back to try out the other menu options."}
{"text":"I had the ribs today and they were terrible.  When the ribs came out I just said to myself they look so gross.  But I decided to at least give it a try.  I ate a tiny piece and it was absolutely disgusting - ribs were hard. I also had the wings and they were gross too.  I also had the coleslaw and it was just so bland.  It was all bland and inedible.  Will never go there again.  I can't believe the good reviews I have read about this place.  This place was unbelievably gross."}
{"text":"You'll get your money's worth with their healthy portions. The pulled pork was good, as was the mound of poutine. The wings? Not really a fan of them - the presentation or how they tasted."}
{"text":"I usually go with a select few co-workers for a bi-monthly outing to the Lou Dawgs on King St.    First timers try the Pulled Pork Po Boy'ed.  Ask for sauce on the side and sauce it yourself to your liking.   Reasonably priced and a great comfort meal."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken Salad is amazing!!!!! So good and so delicious, it's pulled chicken in a salad with a very nice dressing..  Staff is great, good place to watch the World Cup or any sports"}
{"text":"Solid food options for a relatively quick bite, or a pitcher of beer and heaps of meat products.  Being a vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised to see a menu dedicated to the non-meat eaters. Salads, without meat were really appreciated. The variety of barbeque sauces were amazing. I really liked the darker, smokier version of sauce. I put it on my salad and doused the stolen french fries with it. Taste the vareity of sauces and see which one you prefer.  The cheddar jalapeno muffins were not nearly as good as I had hoped, but the fries- both sweet potato, and regular, were superb."}
{"text":"The pulled pork poutine is delicious!!!!! Their chicken gravy is so tasty and would be wonderful on a lot of things. The combination of the pulled pork, gravy and melted cheese curds, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Okay so 7 months of life in Canada and I finally yielded and had poutine for the first time here and it made me feel like I had betrayed fish and chips.  Coming here with friends late evening I was surprised to find that they had an open mic karoke. Luckily for everyone there I was drunk but not that drunk.  The first thing on my mind was eating so looking at the chalkboard in the back I saw a large pulled pork poutine for less than $10. Along with that my friend Justin being ever the hawkeye for freebies saw in the men's bog a calendar for free item of the day. Which was chilli cheese fries, obviously I made him ask for it without the cheese.  WHAM less than 4 minutes after having drinks and finding a table the food was out, which makes me question the reason for it being soooo quick.   The poutine was huge, there was no way I was going to finish it so three others dug in along with the chilli fries we got for free. Only bad point was there was cheese in the poutine which I did not expect.  The staff here were really nice and I am not sure why but there did not seem to be as many tables inside, unless they had been moved for the karaoke.   Afterwards we continued on our night, but something in me did not feel right, like I had been abused by a high calorie monster. Can not imagine trying poutine again any time soon."}
{"text":"As a venue goes this smokey joint was a little oddly shaped, crowding everyone into about 1/4 of the available space as this was where the tables were located.  Let's talk a little on the tables, or rather the long wooden bar that was meant to house drinks. I would say that the bar was not really drunk friendly, but it was drunk and sober alike that knocked drink after drink to the floor smashing glasses and causing injuries. I'm still sporting a cut from an errant piece of glass.  the problem lies in the less than flat nature of the board. Clumsy as I am, I couldn't be trusted to rest my drink all night. Lest it be wasted.   Beyond the obviously defective table the waiters and waitresses were fantastic, always ready with a new platter of food and a pleasant smile. In fact they even broke the rules a little, pouring me free drink well after the 9 pm cut off point.   As a non-meat eater I often have a hard time finding munchies at the Yelp events, I was pleasantly surprised with the cold bean salad, pretty standard vege fare, plates and plates of french fries, and a mini fish slider. So though I couldn't taste the restaurants main dish, I was happy with the alternatives.   Bottom line...I would visit this porkery again to see if their stellar service holds true on another night."}
{"text":"I just started working in the neighbourhood and wanted to check this place out.    I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a side salad.  Food was tasty, but not overly exciting.  I liked the atmosphere. It was a light sports night, so not that busy, but I know I would like it more during the playoffs, etc.   I will probably be back because the prices, especially on the drinks, were reasonable and they have a lot of specials going on.  I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because the wait staff took at least 10 minutes to get us menus and acknowledge we were even there.  There were only 2 other tables to wait on in the entire place at the time.  I will say that the food came out fast.   I will have to go back and try the Loutine the next time!"}
{"text":"Great late night bbq. Dusted wings are awesome and a must try. Best I've had in toronto to this day."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Brunch. Great Waitress and food. LOVED, LOVED the pulled pork and pulled chicken.  I ordered the Dawg's breakfast . Excellent and filling. The only thing I would change is the eggs poached with vinegar... never like that... a personal preference.  Service was attentive, quick and very accommodating. Waitress always had a smile and never indicated once, that she was feeling put out. (as so often happens these days in may places; I often find wait staff have such attitude)  The only other thing I would change is the ambiance... has too much of a sense of eating in a barn. I'd like to see clean, cheeky, fun, colourful furniture. And a little more lighting, rather than a feeling I'm eating in a dank, dark cave.  Price was good and they have good specials."}
{"text":"The mighty loutine with pulled pork is effing amazing. It's exactly what you're expecting whine you order a poutine. But don't bother with the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Cool location and friendly staff, but the ride stops there. I ordered chicken wings, which costs $9 and includes 5 small mediocre wings without fries...wtf? That's crap! Tuesday night is their beer special... $14.95 for a pitcher of the house beer... how is that a special?? On top of that, the place was DEAD despite the fact that an important hockey game was currently underway... If Canada didn't win tonight, it would have been 1 star for Lou Dawg's. I hope I (or you) don't end up back here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.    The southern brunch here is pretty intimidating.  For $11.95, you get a giant heaping plate of fries, cheese, pulled pork, and two poached eggs smothered in sauce.  Can anyone eat this entire plate without passing out?  Good luck.  We also had the eggs Benny with pulled pork served alongside home fries and fruit.    The portions are quite large.  You won't leave hungry.  I wasn't a fan of the big chunks of cubed potatoes nor the somewhat dry orange slices.  The cheese curds in the poutine weren't squeaky.    The pulled pork was my favourite and the eggs are cooked well too.  This place is A-OK in my books for brunch but I think dinner might be their specialty.  BTW:  Service was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Man do I love southern barbecue and to have a place in Toronto that serves it up in that style is awesome.  I read up on this place from many online reviews and my friends and I decided to give it a shot.  The place was completely empty for a Friday night, which was weird, but who cares we got a table quick time!  The decor isn't anything too noteworthy here, in fact I felt like I was in high school again sitting in my buddy's basement while his mom made us dinner!  Not a bad thing I suppose!  Service was top notch and our servers came by constantly to refill drinks and get us various sauces and sides.  We all shared sliders, pulled pork poutines, sweet potato fries, pulled pork sandwiches and beef brisket sandwiches.  Wow the meat was tender and the food tasted great.  Be sure to come with an appetite because the portions are nice and huge, just like the south would want it!"}
{"text":"Had an ok dinner here tonight, but I wouldn't be able to rate it more than that for a few reasons.  The poutine seemed to be really yummy for the first three bites, but the gravy like consistency of the cheese seemed a little strange when the menu specified that it was made with cheese curds.  The ribs had too much smoky BBQ sauce on them. While said sauce was very good, it was laid on too thickly. The ribs themselves were not fall off the bone tender or incredibly succulent.  The smoked wings in dry rub were ok, too. It's hard to find another word to describe anything we had because none of it was very good and none of it was very bad. For 1 pound there were 4 whole wings, which would amount to 4 drummies and 4 flats with the tips attached. Dry rub had flavour but no heat. I would have liked to have seen some more zing for southern BBQ.  Service was friendly, but not the most efficient. I'm not sure this was completely her fault. We were a little more forgiving once we realized that our server was both tending bar and serving by herself. I understand that staffing a Tuesday night on King St can be difficult and that service staff need to make money and the less servers, the more money. However, it took us 20 minutes from the time we sat down until the time we got our drinks. The server explained that the bourbon lemonade was literally fresh squeezed so that was why it took so long. The drink was pretty much the only thing about the meal that was outstanding and we're totally forgiving patrons if things are acknowledged.  The atmosphere was a bit much for me on a Tuesday night at 8 pm. The music was great, but blaring and in true King St. D-bag style some guy was pacing right in front of our table yapping on his phone. I wish people like this would just die... not literally the people themselves, but the habit of being a d-bag."}
{"text":"I wanted Ribs and i got Ribs! They were smokey, meaty and a bit chewy but i like that.   I enjoy having different rib experiences.  There are 2 sauces that i think are basic but good. The ribs were huge to our surprise.  I shared a full rack with my husband with a side of large beans, coleslaw and one corn muffin. We had 2 beers each. We almost died from food overdose. But we both agreed we loved it and will be back, if just to pick up a full rack to take back home so we can pass out on the couch immediately. Our hands smelled smokey the next day. I am going back soon to try their smokey wings. Atmosphere was normal, it's a small pub / bar wooden decorations with a big screen at the back. Waitress was super busy that night and didn't have time for chit chat but everything came in reasonable time and correct. She even apologized for the rush after and thanked us.  We were there last Friday. I will be back! I gave it a 4 because it was great, not jaw dropping spectacular but very fair."}
{"text":"Prefaced by the words of every politician ever, \"let me be clear\": This place is really really okay. The service is okay, the ambiance is okay, and the menu items are okay. Nothing is above average, except for one standout: The Coleslaw. It deserves those capital letters. I wish I could both bold and italicize it to denote how special it is.   The Coleslaw is comprised of chopped cabbage, red onion and dried cranberries a.k.a. \"cranbaisins\", languishing seductively in the zingiest of dressings. It really enhances what would be an otherwise entirely mediocre pulled pork sandwich. I usually order the \"Meat and Two Sides\", and you bet your buttons I'm getting The Coleslaw every time. Goddamn."}
{"text":"Go to Lou Dawgs and order the DRY-RUB wings. Eat one. Now try one with some hot sauce. Now have another plain one. Repeat until all wings have been consumed. You will be thoroughly innoculated against fast food restaurants offering \"boneless-wing-style-Buffalo-flavor\" nuggets.  If you are not a fan of hot wings, use the above instructions substituting one (or both) of the barbecue sauces to innoculated yourself from deep-fried frozen wings dunked in goop from a food-service bucket.  In addition to the BEST WINGS in the city, Lou's. Offers old-school po'boy sandwiches, brisket, ribs, pulled pork and other American faves as well as homegrown Poutine. Before you ask; yes there are vegetarian options however I think a vegetarian that wants to patronise a barbecue spot is a little like a dermatologist that goes to a tanning salon.   Service is excellent and the portions are heavier than they look.  (Who would think one tiny bowl of potato salad or beans could be so filling?)"}
{"text":"I saw the rating and some of the reviews and was expecting to be disappointed.   I couldn't have been more wrong. The server/bartender (Ryan) was friendly and we were well attended. Ok, it was not busy but that can sometimes be worse.   The food was actually quite tasty and well prepared. I had the pulled pork Po Boy and it was delicious!  I highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Okay, went here last night to satisfy my craving for meaty smoked deliciousness, and I've gotta say, they've really upped their game. The smoked shaved turkey wrap with smoky bacon, cheese, tomato, greens and house sauce still kicks ASS.  No really.  Serious ass.  Nothing new there though - it was always great.  Finally tried their pulled pork poutine  and was delighted. TONS of meat, and the gravy had an amazing flavour.  Its probably the best pulled pork poutine in the nieghbourhood.  The large is HUGE, so beware. The pulled pork sandwich has also improved since the last time I tried it.  I was impressed!  They now do table service, whereas previously you ordered it at the cash and it was brought out to you.  I dig it.  So if you didn't love this place before, give it another shot - I pretty much promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"More filler for the mediocre BBQ scene. *2.5 stars  I'm no stranger to BBQ, from absolute garbage to primo stuff down south and Lou  Dawgs fits perfectly in the middle. They get points for style, but few points for execution.  To be fair, I'm a dry rub BBQ fan and not a fan of the stuff slathered in BBQ sauce. It's copping out if you ask me, 'cause when BBQ is done right, much like a great steak, it doesn't need much help, if any at all.  The mains and the sides were okay at best. The beans were okay, but the brisket and the pulled pork were completely uninspiring. The brisket was dry and I couldn't find a hint of smoke and the pulled pork had no flavour other than BBQ sauce.  I want LD's to be great, but I'll just have to wait until Buster Rhinos finally makes its downtown."}
{"text":"came here because I heard how the pulled pork was amazing but i didn't think so. the bread got really soggy and wasn't that good to begin with.  The bbq sauce wasn't even that great.  total fail.  The fries however were SOO good.  I'm not a big fan of poutine but their gravy is actually better than others. i've tried the traditional and the meaty bean poutine.  be warned though the large size is LARGE. I would go back again just to have their plain regular fries, hot and fresh.  You really can't enjoy it properly when its poutine style.  ps the place is pretty sketch.  but the times i've been here were always like past 2am after a night out."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointed by the service.  I've been here before, was always impressed by the food, but the place was generally empty.  Clearly, when it is busy, service falls off.  I ordered the simplest thing - poutine.  Simple, poutine.  It took the staff three tries to get it right.  And they kept giving us attitude when they would get it wrong.  Once we were told \"be clearer next time\" in quite the tone.  Really, a very simple order.  Don't give attitude when you get it wrong twice.  Especially to paying customers.    Despite the good food, it's likely I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the fair here.  Overpriced and mediocre food.    I got a pulled pork sandwich.  The pork itself was ok...just kind of underwhelming.  Though other commenters mentioned too much sauce, mine had hardly any.  Actually..the meat was pretty  dry and not very flavourful.  The bread was the most offensive part of the sandwich, though.  Nothing kills a sandwich like low quality buns.  And the price...while the sandwich is only $7, it comes with no sides.  Each side is an additional $3.  While my coleslaw was good, i don't think it was worth the price tag.  Maybe I'm cheap, but I think a sandwich should come with a side  Overall underwhelming."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here at the Yelp party a couple of years ago, so I looked forward to returning.  I dropped by with a friend, excited to have the pulled pork and succulent fries again.  My friend's pulled pork was a bit bland, but but my three sliders (pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket) were also tepid and dry.  The fries were hard, as if they'd been sitting in back for a while.  We did turn up early for dinner, but that's not really an excuse.  Pity!  We live around the block from Stockyards, so we really have no reason to come back here ever again."}
{"text":"Good southern bbq spot right downtown toronto!   This place is interesting. Was once listed on BlogTO as top BBQ joint in Toronto (though 12/13), but seemed to have lost popularity/cred. I walk by all the time, even went in a couple times, but never stayed because it's always weirdly empty! Have heard some say that it only gets packed late night as bata near closing. But finally committed and it was worth it! Went saturday mid day and it had a decent crowd going!   Ribs, wings, sides, sandwiches/wraps they have it all. Even a poutine list! House beer is a plus too!   Ribs- saucy saucy. Some may find too saucy!  Wings- Dry Rub was good, but dry enough to want sauce! Also ordered Hot, which were flavourful with a kick! Not spicy to the point of only tasting the hotness.  Sides/Etc: Fried Pickles: made well, more juicy and less deep fried than most places.  Cole Slaw: SO delicious! Creamy yet light, the right amount of sweet! My favourite cole slaw hands down. Was great for balancing out all the salt and spice on everything else!  They have so many other options for mains as well as sides, would go back for more! (Need...more...slaw...) Especially want to try the jalapeño cheddar corn muffins. Unfortunately they were out. They had also discounted their darker house beer. So the food was surprisingly good,  but I'm still wondering if this place is over its peak...  Try it for yourself and let me know your thoughts!"}
{"text":"I love Lou Dawgs.  After a long night out, my friend and I wanted to indulge in BBQ bliss. After consulting Yelp.ca (shout-outs) and another Yelp member, we settled for something that was relatively close to my home and shoe stores for some shopping after.   A few blocks away from King and Spadina was a small entrance to what is now considered my favourite BBQ joint. Lou Dawgs is tucked away a bit, the sign is large enough to notice but you have to crawl down a few stairs to get in.  The place was nice, what you should expect from a BBQ place. Wooden and Western. Double W's. Although quite empty when we arrived right at opening hours on a Saturday, I was surprised to see anyone inside with us.  The Brunch items sounded so sweet, especially their Breakfast Loutine (poutine with homemade gravy with pulled pork and poached eggs on top). However, a few questions later and several answers past the waitress lured me into my greatest BBQ platter to date. Choice of 2 sides (coleslaw, fries, black bean and corn salad) and 2 meats (pulled pork and beef brisket), it was a dream come true. My buddy had the ribs.  Verdict: The BBQ is done so well here. Smokey and tender with extra super-delicious BBQ and hot sauces on the side. Ribs with a pink smoke ring is such a beautiful thing to see in Toronto. They were also not over sauced. They had nothing to hide.  Pulled pork was my favouite out of all the BBQ animals we had. Brisket the least. The sides were decent. Fries were extra good, but I think it was one of those \"in the moment,\" kind of things.  While waiting 20 minute for the ribs to come out (wait time was warned but we agreed), I tweeted Lou Dawgs. A few minutes later, I got a tweet back which I showed the server in exchange for Caesars for the table.  Pretty sweet."}
{"text":"\"Our Smoked Beef Brisket was loaded with meat - up to the point when it was a bit difficult to eat. Nonetheless, it was a very flavorful meal especially when coupled with their home-made barbecue sauce.\" \"The experience made for a very heavy lunch, maybe that was the reason for not having a lot more people visiting for lunch? Not every company will allow you to take an after-meal nap at your desk - a very southern approach. Nachos might have been a better options for us.\" \"As southern cuisine goes, the only veggies we had came in bottles of sauces on the table - to be expected though.\" These are just a few bites of our review.."}
{"text":"Lou Dawg's is great choice for southern sandwhiches.  People, remember that this is King Street and not the Southern United States we're talking about.  .  The pulled pork is a little dry but one can always add some extra BBQ sauce.  The sweet potato fries are awesome.   This place is very clean and it's open until 4:00 am."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. The pulled pork and pulled chicken came out cold. The pouting was ok. My husband's ribs were way way saucy (even for him who likes saucy). The sweet potato fries and cut fries are fresh soft and taste homemade.  Other than that, I'd go elsewhere next time. The server was super nice but she ran around the dining room by herself the entire Saturday night and forgot some things (super nice and friendly though). But they need more staff in the front of the house and in the back. The food took forever and was cold."}
{"text":"went last night for some dinner and left pretty happy and definitely full.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and being a Sunday apparently the place had already been eaten out of the white buns so it was whole wheat or nothing. Im willing to look past this for the sake of the review. The pulled pork itself was really good quality, clean cuts and not fatty. The catch is that its not as smothered in sauce as I normally like, however they had bbq sauce on the table to top it off as needed which saved the sandwich. Once more sauce was applied, the sandwich was a solid 7/10, and probably in my Top 10 pulled pork sandwiches in the city.  The lack of bun variety took it down to a 6 though, and had they not had extra sauce to be put on it, it would be a 5 our of 10.  for a side dish, I had the sweet potato fries which were pretty perfect - just thick enough, but not too thick that result in soggy fries. The bbq mayo dipping sauce was quite awesome too.  other things at the table included Chicken and Cheese Chilli which I sampled and was impressed with. another had the Sampler Sliders which was a pull chicken, pulled pork, and beef brisket sampler along with some coleslaw and potato salad. stole a bite of the brisket and the coleslaw, both were quite good as well.  overall, tasty food that is good for the price and nothing was a let down at the table of 5 people, so I'm going to give this place a solid 4 on the Yelp scale."}
{"text":"Just got home from my first meaty meal in a looong time and at long last, I was able to use my Groupon here (or was it Fab Find? I can't remember, but I think I spent $15 or $20 to get $40) AND it was Sunday brunch time!  I've been waiting to get my BBQ on at Lou Dawg's since this past summer, but the mood to eat lunch food never really hit me. Not until I found out Lou Dawg's did Brunch!  So with $40 to blow here's what I got:  *2 extra spicy caesars ($5 each) * 3 meats with 2 sides ($15.95) - pulled pork, beef (brisket?), chicken and sweet potato fries and coleslaw) * Lou's Breakfast ($9.95) - poached eggs, home fries, amazing BBQ beans, jalapeno cheddar corn muffin * An extra side of BBQ beans to go with my doggie bagged meat  It was nice an peaceful inside, the majority of tables (it's not that big of  a place) were full but nobody was too loud (and hey, it's Hangover Sunday, non?) AND some guy named Matthew Stafford and his band of him and a Juno award-winning guitarist plays there every Sunday from 12-3PM. The dude rocks it out belting bluesy tunes and breaks out into harmonica solos while playing the drums with his other hand!  It felt like a mix of down South and Canada (there was curling on the telly, go figure!). If they had more tables and big screen TVs this would be my hangout spot for sports games for sure.  As for the food - while I rarely indulge in because of the gastro-intestinal repercussions, the BEANS were amazing - BBQ-y with bits of meat and potato. I had to order an extra side of them to take home with my left over BBQ'd pulled pork, beef and chicken. The potato fries that came with the breakfast were a little skimpy but maybe because they were spread out. The jalapeno cheddar corn muffins were delish - sweet on the outside but savoury on the inside and the sweet potato fries were sweet and thick. The caesars were alright, could've used a bit more ice and spice.   Anyhoo - you know those social commerce sites...I always buy into them, use the voucher at a place I've never been to and vow to NEVER return (or just to spend my money elsewhere next time)... but not Lou Dawgs - no...this place, I will definitely be returning to time and time again.   And while my butt and thighs will disagree, I truly regret not ordering the Loutine (their take on a poutine with pulled pork)."}
{"text":"I was feeling nostalgic so I went back to ol' lous for the pulled pork poutine. There were plenty of tables available and each one was drenched in some type of liquid. That's gross Lou! Gotta get the staff to make cleaning a THING that happens once in a while.   The poutine was completely different from 2 yrs ago... I remember plentiful portions and big thick cut fries.  Last night's anorexic fries weren't satieting and the meal was forgettable. The floor and tables were so so wet.  It was like the aftermath of that scene from Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo where he broke open fish tank.  I think it was the scene before he pureed that expensive fish.   Nostalgia = ruined.  I'll come back but not without a poncho"}
{"text":"I dunno, my co-workers seem to like this place, and I know I want to, but my pulled-pork sandwich was lacking any distinction. I wanted tanginess, but instead felt like I was consuming a fairly bland sloppy joe-style sandwich. My \"Yukon Gold\" fries did not fare any better. They tasted sort of undercooked and mealy. Though they felt like substantial pieces of potato, they tasted more like frozen.  That said, my boss claims that Lou Dawg's potato salad is to die for, and the place seems to be something of a Friday ritual with my colleagues. It's also a fairly nice space and the staff seemed nice as well, so maybe I'll try it again.  I'm just hoping I don't get more of the same."}
{"text":"Recently went there with 2 companions. We have all been 'schooled' in the Deep South, and this was a true disappointment.  The meat is too sweet. I don't know how else to put this but they seem to be using a lot of BBQ sauce. I don't know if they are using the renderings from the BBQ process, as they should.  The premises are generally OK, and the service prompt and pleasant.  Value is alright, and what needs to be done here to is to get a decent real recipe and stick to it.  This is not rocket science as myriads of BBQ shacks pull this off (no pun intended) on a daily basis. It would also be nice to feature a North Carolina BBQ style, nice and vinegary as an additional incentive.  The sweet potato fries are good. I will probably not return."}
{"text":"I first heard about Lou Dawg's from JP Arencibia, from the Blue Jays. Since my first JP Special, I have recommended this place to everyone in the Toronto area. I also fell in love with their dry rubbed wings and jalapeño corn muffins. I've personally brought more than 9 new customers in and If I lived closer I'd be there weekly! (And I'm the friend who brought Pat C!)"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite ribs I've tried in Toronto so far. St . Louis style and very tasty"}
{"text":"I feel bad hating on Lou Dawg's, but I'll likely never go back. The staff is excellent. The were really friendly and always checking in, but the food wasn't good.   I got the Loutine, which is a poutine with a healthy serving of pulled pork on top. It looked great, but once I got into it and my hunger subsided, I was pretty upset with what was left over.   The gravy tasted like KFC gravy, which is fine when I'm getting some soggy fries and gravy from the Colonel, but not when I'm promised something so tasty. The pork didn't have much flavor either.   I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a new BBQ place in Toronto but I was left disappointed. I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was very quiet. It had a classic american BBQ pit feel, which raised my expectations of the food. The staff were friendly and accommodating.   I had the big dawg pork sammie, came with no sides which was disappointing.(I mean I'm at a BBQ joint, i would have expected some coleslaw or fries at least). the pork was a little tough, but wasn't too hard to chew. However, the pork did lack flavor. It really needed the extra sauce on the table to save the sandwich otherwise it would have been bland. The bun starts to break apart after the 3 bite which forced me to eat the rest of the sandwich with a fork and knife. I finished the sandwich but wanted more.  The house made lager was very light. Those who are fans of Coors light or Moosehead would enjoy it but for myself, I prefer strong bold flavors in my beers.  Overall, I was left disappointed, and it looks like my search for a good BBQ restaurant in Toronto continues."}
{"text":"I went to Lou Dawg's for my birthday two years in a row.  This is a great little hidden gem on the west end of King Street.  We were first attracted to the cool blues rock sounds emanating from within.  Upon descending into their wooden tavern, what caught my attention next was the pump action bbq sauce, just out and available for consumption.  I hadn't even ordered any food yet but I had to have a sample... it was the best bbq sauce I'd tried.  I've since been to Memphis where all the restaurants claim to have award-winning ribs and bbq sauce, and well, this is definitely comparable!  The kitchen serves an array of southern bbq until 4am... which includes their famous Lou-tine... a poutine topped with brisket or pulled pork.  Yahoo-yummy!  Their selection of musical artists is discerning and perfect.  I've only heard the greatest local acoustic and blues talent at this venue.  They have regular performers who are among the most talented musicians I've been fortunate enough to see.    The ambiance is beautifully lit and decorated and the staff were genuinely courteous.  The owner even gave me a free shot on my birthday!  A must try is their house draft beer."}
{"text":"I'm rating Lou Dawgs not just as a pure southern style BBQ joint but as what it really is. Another cool, upperscale \"fast food\" joint / bar (open till 4 am!) that makes for a great place to watch the Leafs or other sports.   The food here is fairly decent - the sandwiches are great, the rest is mediocre. I've had the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches here and they're really tender with a nice sauce. With $7-9 / sandwhich it's not a bad price to pay and you can get some slaw on the which for another 99 cents. The sides add a bit more to the price but they come in healthy servings (the sweet potato fries and the dipping sauce are really good!).   On top of this I just tried the ribs (of which I believe they were beef) and they weren't all that great. First off they left the lining on the ribs which is personally a big no-no for me (I know others don't care) and they were still a bit dry. The sauce was pretty mediocre and the ribs weren't terribly meaty and didn't really fall of the bone.  The atmosphere of the place is pretty interesting and they have a projector and multiple TVs set up to show the game if you want to have a beer and watch with the guys.  As long as you stick to the sandwhiches and don't think this place is the holy grail for souther BBQ food, Lou Dawgs is actually a pretty good place to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"You need to be really really drunk to enjoy the food here. We were a group of 12 and went after work. The service was good in the beginning. They took our orders right away and got us drinks. However, it took forever for them to get all our food. It was almost as if we were wondering whether they went shopping for the ingredients first. After waiting what seemed like an eternity we finally get cold food. Even the cold soggy nachos and cold tacos weren't appetizing even though we were starving. I think I have said enough and I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I heard back from the Manager! He saw my review on here, and apologized for not responding to my email. I trust he didn't even get it.  He pointed out that all of what I mentioned has been rectified, and ankowledged all of my complaints were valid ones.   I suppose that's all I wanted - was someone to say, 'hey! i'm listening!', and I got it, from the Manager. Only took a year.   And on that note, he offered me a complimentary evening out, to give Lou Dawg's another go. And on that account, I'll increase the rating to 3 stars, from the lousy 1 I originally gave them.  I won't be going. Too many fails, that I just can't return.  It was a nice offer, though. Just too little, too late, i suppose!"}
{"text":"good live music - small stage tho. try the Lou Dawg's Black.. like a porter.. very nice. Been here before for wings and they're pretty alright too.."}
{"text":"Lou Dawgs should be called unfit for a dawg, terrible food all round, Went there on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm for lunch. Called to see if i need to make a reservation and the waitress told me that was not necessary.  So headed down excited to try the BBQ Ribs and other goodies. I should have realized when i only saw one other table at the peak of lunch time busy.   Wifey ordered the Loutine and I ordered the half rack of ribs and sweet potato fries with BBQ Mayo.  I asked for the ribs to be saucy which i would later come to regret.  Fries were delivered first to the table.  Sweet Potato Fries - Extremely undercooked and soggy and not that many in a basket for the price. $5  Wifey loutine looked ok she mentioned after that it had no real taste and tasted more like Javex which was worrying  Ribs arrived smothered in sauce picked up the first rib and wow tasted like a burnt piece of firewood. Ok I thought i had an end piece so i took a middle one and same thing.   The ribs were way overcooked burnt to a crisp. I removed the sauce and the tops of the ribs were BLACK burnt black.  The taste indescribable in a nightmarish way later on in the evening still couldn't get the taste out of my mouth.  The ribs also had hardly any meat on them for the $13 that was being charged. I don't know if it was the sauce or the ribs itself but the taste was horrific.  I don't normally return food  and i have eaten bad things and just ate it and said ok not coming back here again but i actually wanted to vomit.  Told the waitress that i was sucking back more sauce than ribs, the taste is disgusting and they are burnt completely.  Looked in the kitchen only one chef basically a young guy too preoccupied with his IPHONE.  Waitress took the ribs off my bill apologized and asked if i wanted anything else. Decided to brave and went for the wings BAD CHOICE.   Wings came over covered in dry rub which i though yum will have some kick. Absolutely nothing had zero taste and funny tasted like Javex again. Worrying.  Stay away. I should have trusted my fellow yelpers.   Waitress was really nice and kind shame she is let down by serving terrible food.  Save your money and the hassle go and try Stockyards at Yonge and St.Clair. Way better BBQ except you have to scramble a seat if you decide to eat in."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Only have two servers for entire restaurant and bar so service takes forever. As a result service is poor. Waitor brought water and take food order. Never asked for drinks. And this was all when the place was empty. It's decent at best to get away from crowds. But that's probably the only good thing I have to say about this place. They really need better management"}
{"text":"Huge portions and great prices.  I ordered the triple combo of pulled pork, brisket, and pulled chicken.  The brisket wasn't so great, kind of fatty and on the bland side, but the pulled chicken and pulled pork easily made up for any shortcomings, really terrific.  t came with a couple wedges of nice bread to sort of create bite sized sandwiches as I made my way through the offerings.    Service for our large group was quick and efficient.  Quick in and out and really quite pleasant as a dining experience.  It is in a basement but they have decorated the space beautifully, well done."}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich and the filet o' sole sandwich. The brisket is covered in a tangy bbq sauce, but didn't have any detectable smoke flavor. The fish was battered and crispy and the winner of the two. The service is friendly and they have better customer service than some of the nicer places in Toronto I've been to."}
{"text":"So many mixed reviews here.   I came in with three friends on a cold winters day for poutine week #lapoutineweek. After spending a year in rural Quebec and only eating poutine in greasy spoons, I'm a purist. I almost never stray away fries, gravy (\"sauce\" in Quebec) and squeaky cheese (cheese curds). In this circumstance our server, Matt highly recommended the Mighty Loutine, pulled pork poutine. I went for it.  Two of us had the small pulled pork poutines, one a small chili-cheese poutine (for veggies) and other is lacto, so she went for a pulled pork sandwich and fries. First, fries were awesome. Fries are the base of any poutine. Cheese curds are fundamental to any poutine. Anyone that throws in any random cheese to poutine, is not poutine. A real poutine means squeaky cheese. The gravy was good, but the primary takeaway from this meal was the yummy pulled pork, stringy, and season perfectly. Poutines were $7.90. so you can't really go wrong. For two bucks more you can go for a large poutine which is enormous. Hello, gluttony!  I'm also going to mention the service, because it was remarkable. I can't remember the last time I've had such a great customer service anywhere. Matt was super friendly, attentive, and must have brought over a dozen re-fills before we could even ask. I'm definitely coming back here for afterwork drinks."}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING. The bartender alone was running the entire thing and he did an amazing excellent job. The wings are the only reason I gave the place 4 stars, since the hot sauce was not hot but sweet and the mild dry rub was excessive. The meat quality and cook were outstanding. The pulled pork nachos beat sneaky dee's by a million points. They also have an extensive choice of bourbons and southern beers. The place is clean and pleasant, the prices are reasonable. Overall a nice relaxed place with 5-star service, cheap beer and good food. Must see at King west."}
{"text":"It's OK for what it is. I've had the meat platter to myself twice, and it's not really that filling for the price. Usually at a place like this you get the platter to share, but it's around 20 bucks and not filling for one person. The meat ranges from tasty to bland, all very tender though. It's the only BBQ of the sort around, and in a pretty ritzy area so I guess they can get away with being overpriced. I hear really good things about the Loutine, but really everything on the menu is 5-10 bucks too much for the quality and quantity of food.  The service and atmosphere are awesome, though."}
{"text":"The food was alright, me and friends were pretty satisfied. We ordered 3 meat combos with sweet potato mash/coleslaw, nacho and pull pork poutine. The bread came with the combo was very dry, sweet potato mash was unique, I highly recommend it. None of us liked nachos, dry and bland, sneaky dee's has way better nachos!! The pull pork poutine was our favorite, but still not comparable to poutines in Montreal. It's definitely not a place I'd crave for."}
{"text":"Good...but, not great.   The Service is prompt, friendly but beyond that it's a bit disappointing. I lived in the Mid-West (Kansas City) and travelled extensively in the South. Simply put: this is no where near the sublime artery bursting BBQ I've had in those Locales. It's more like a cookbook/recipe interpretation on what would quantify as Southern BBQ. As with all takes on locale-specific cuisine, there's an interpretation aspect to it. Unfortunately, something has been lost in the translation with Lou Dawg's.   ...As a few other reviewers have stated: I *want* to like this place, but probably won't try it again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  From the moment you walk in this place has you hooked! (That is if you like the smell of BBQ).   This place is very reasonably priced. They do a very good pulled pork and beef brisket. I've had both and I can't decide which I like better. That's what keeps me going back.   When you eat here you have to make sure you try their bean salad. I have never tasted such a good bean salad, and their sweet potato fries with their mayo is delicious!  If you're in the area and are looking for a reasonably priced quick eat this place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there last Saturday.  We'd stopped in the week before for drinks and liked it so wanted to get back to check out the food.  We shared the smoked beef brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich and fries.  They were both moist and tasty. And the bun was really soft.  When I'm in the mood for a pulled sandwich, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a relatively quiet hour for their business (Saturday around 1pm); service was nice as quick. The atmosphere was well put together, with a nice rock-country theme to this basement restaurant.  Off the brunch menu, tried both the pulled-pork & hollandaise sauce meal (forget the name) and the smoked apple waffles. Presentation was damn impressive, but unfortunately the food fell a little short of that. The pulled pork lacked flavor (although, the added condiment of barbecue sauce saved the meal) and the hollandaise sauce was equally bland (no punch of sour).   I enjoyed the smoked apple waffles quite a bit more--the apples definitely had a smoked whiskey after taste, but were a little too mushy for my personal taste.  While a fun-themed place, ultimately the quality of the meal did not match the aesthetics of the restaurant."}
{"text":"What's not to like, huge portions, bbq smokey goodness, beer and pulled pork. Honky tonk roadhouse funky type atmosphere, was disappointed Patrick Swayze didn't come strolling in"}
{"text":"Service and food excellent. Have had pulled pork tacos, fish tacos, sweet potatoe fries, ribs, pulled pork sandwich and all was extremely good. Well priced excellent BBQ. Will be back."}
{"text":"Checked out Lou Dawgs for dinner and drinks on a Friday night.  Service was a little slow due to two different Lou Dawgs softballs teams flooding into the bar, but the food was well worth the wait!  Being my first time eating there I had the Slider Sampler 3-some platter and it was delicious.  Great pulled pork, amazing pulled chicken, fantastic brisket! The coleslaw was good, though the potato salad left a little to be desired having too much vinegar in it for my taste.  Grabbed a couple pitchers of \"Lou Dawgs\" ale, which is also pretty decent for an in house brew.  Decent prices, great food... I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Ya service was good.. But the food was gross , we had pulled pork and beef brisket .. Tasted like it was made last week , sauce was too sweet .. And the gravy on the poutine was also nasty. Someone should call Gordon Ramsey .."}
{"text":"After a fun mid afternoon meeting with a very hungover @mattyspence at the utterly horrific Brant House, Kat F and I needed to chill with some regular people - and that's kind of hard to come by these days on King West.  I was desperately craving chicken wings and after talking with Darryl at the elite event at Lou Dawgs about his in house smokers I had been itching to try their offering.  The best: Lou Dawgs was empty at 4pm on a Thursday, and the girl working the counter was super friendly and cool. The 3 of us were literally the only people there and it was a great time.  The good: - They have a real HD decoder box on their TV.  Seriously.  We watched women's Olympic hockey and it looked amazing.  I'm pretty sure since we were the only people there we could have watched whatever we wanted. - The coleslaw is great.  It had red onions, raisins and maybe even currants in it.  It was great coleslaw. - The fries are very good.  You need to ask for the BBQ mayo to dip them in.  5 star french fries.  The not bad, but not great: - The wings were different - they are whole chicken wings with drumstick and 'other piece' attached.  Very unique and I'm undecided on what I think about this style of chicken breakdown. - I didn't like the BBQ sauce on the chicken wings.  This is a personal preference issue and as you may or may not know, I like my wings a specific way (crispy, saucy and with a traditional New York butter vinegar sauce).  I don't like BBQ sauce wings, but these were still pretty good considering the fundamental flaw of this not being a wing sauce. - No veggies and bleu cheese, but the coleslaw was an almost-acceptable substitute.  Overall, I  really like this place and I will be back, but not very often.  I generally don't like this area of town and if it was located on the east side (note to people with VC $$ - they have franchise opportunities!) I would be by here more often."}
{"text":"With so many options on King West, it's easy to give this one a miss 9 times out of 10. If you're stuck with no options and need a place to eat/drink a beer at though, walk into the basement of this fine dining establishment.   Usually pretty empty, you can almost certainly find a seat. Most of the times I find myself here on their wing nights, but apparently they have a Karaoke night too.   Wings are decent, with a number of different in house sauces to dip with. I usually go for dry rub, but tried their honey garlic as well. Wings come with the wing, and the drumstick attached - something I do like. The spices were overdone though, and often had to scrape some off to avoid  the feeling of choking on grit."}
{"text":"Great bartender.   Really good band.  Very limited draft beer selection.  The ribs are downright awful."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich I have tasted in the city.  I will be back more than once - guaranteed. Open late on weekends. Nothing says \"have a nice sleep\" like going to bed at 4 am with one of these bad-boys in ma' belly!  Nice work Trevor."}
{"text":"I'd walked by this place hundreds of times, but never been inside. Finally, some friends directed us to meet them there to catch a hockey playoff game. Let me first say that the immediate impact of the very friendly staff was noticeable ... Or was it the immediate free round of welcome shots from the owner? Hmmmm. Either way, it was $3 jack n coke night (diff drink special every night), and the simple but superb better than just bar food menu at reasonable prices was more than a pleasant surprise!  Pulled pork was great, chicken n cheese chilli is just right, and sweet potatoe fries with their special sauce (provided free by staff just to try it) also a hit.  Long story short is that I've been back 4 times this past week to this lil underground spot in my hood that I'd passed up so many times before.  Now, I have just moved into a new condo nearby, with no tv or internet yet ... And we're in the thick of nhl playoffs ... But this has officially become my 2011 nhl playoff hockey watchin spot. I logged a 6 hour shift there last night lol. It hasn't been over-crowded. They have 2 flat screens and one large projector with the commentator sound on. Everyone in the small place is friendly.  Well done. Check it out! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Arrived during the brunch hours on a Sunday and was told by the server to sit anywhere we liked.  I had The Mighty Loutine (large) and a side of Meaty BBQ Beans. As soon as everything arrived I instantly realized my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but that's always a delicious problem to have. Both items were well prepared and arrived in a very reasonable amount of time. Our server was great and was always available for anything we needed.  The only thing I would change would be to have a side option of only beans and leave out the meat. Although, I didn't ask our server if this was even possible, which I probably should have. The Meaty BBQ Beans are great, but I don't always want so much meat in one sitting.  I'm a big fan of BBQ places and would easily recommend this place to anyone interested in this kind of fare."}
{"text":"Contender for worst BBQ in Toronto, greasy, soggy sandwiches, substandard sides and the best part: no ribs. SOLD OUT OF RIBS on a Saturday at 5PM. I mean, why even claim to be a BBQ joint if you don't have ribs? It's like going to Swiss Chalet and them saying \"Sorry herpderp, no chickens today lol\" and acting like you're fu*ked for asking. You know who's fu*ked? Lou Dawgs, that's who.   Staff was rude and dismissive when we inquired why a BBQ spot had no BBQ. Wings are not BBQ. Pulled pork is not BBQ. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere where they actually care. I can't technically give a lower rating to this place, so 1 star it is."}
{"text":"There was a live band which was so loud I couldn't hear my buddy next to me. My friend and I got the \"BIG DAWG PLATTER\" which was confusing because the menu said \"Serves 2, $29.99 per person\". We had a few to drink so we thought it was a great idea. Wrong we were! This is a crapload of mediocre food. Some of it was good, some was over seasoned, but definitely NOT worth the price. A couple of the guys who got individual sandwiches were happy with their dishes, though."}
