{"text":"I ate Dirty Food Catering's food at The Victoria Day Brewer's Backyard beer festival at The Brickworks.  Their sign described them as: \"Pop-Up, Private Event Caterers, Junction Restaurant Location.  Gourmet Comfort Food Done Right.\"  They had more reasonable prices, but were not selling out of food as quickly as the other food trucks and food vendors.  DF offered a choice of, and I quote:  1) \"DF Burger - Ground chuck & pork pattie, garlic aioli, Skinny Dippin' stout beer BQ sauce, Cheese, Pickle, & Lettuce $7.00\"  2) \"DF Pierogi - Hand rolled cheesy potato stuffed peirogy, smoked sour cream, caramelized onions, braised cabbage $6\"  3) \"Soda Pop (Various) $1.00\"  The burger was simple, yet delicious, HOWEVER, (and it's a BIG however) it was still mooing.  I have NEVER been served a burger from a professional kitchen that was THAT undercooked.  It was actually cool in the center or what I would call blue rare if it was a steak.  SEE PHOTOS.  I don't mind a bit of pink in the centre, but this was really raw ---- which is especially concerning considering food spends more time out of the fridge being transported to a hot, outdoor, summer event.  In those situations, I'd prefer ground meat to be fully cooked like the health inspector requires.  Though it was positioned as a family event, I would not have fed a burger that undercooked to a child and really questioned eating it myself.  I do appreciate their friendliness and creativity in the names of items and ingredients, like smoked sour cream.  So I gave them an extra star.  I hope they will pay more attention to details because otherwise I fear the word \"dirty\" in their business name, Dirty Food, will tend to infer unsanitary rather than messy comfort food."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place. Leslie and Jon know what they're doing and they're doing it right. Sweet Cakes are the way to go. Sawdust City's Golden Beach Pale Ale available in the can so I cannot complain about anything.  Food is fresh and cooked to perfection. Can't shout their praises loud enough.   Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch with the girls from work!   Wandered to dundas west looking for good local comfort food. That did we find ^_^  Cute little spot but basic but clean decor.    Food! Home fries and grilled cheese with fried green tomatoes with added bacon ***drool! DF MAYO was on point!  Pierogies were delicious but they were out of caramelized onions.   Breakfast salad was in between healthy and non haha fried egg on top looks super good.   My chicken and waffles... man with candied jalape√±os hit the spot right on.   Not the best I've had in terms of cnw but great flavors.   They offer beaus and Caesars with a good list of alcoholic and coffee drinks!   Looking forward to going back :)"}
