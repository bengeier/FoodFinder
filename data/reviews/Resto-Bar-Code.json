{"text":"Ordered 2 steaks today - medium - served almost raw. Was there over lunchtime - only people there. 3 servers - waitress did not check in once with us after plate served. Coffee was very luke warm.  Terrible service and terrible food. Avoid this place at all cost. $50 wasted."}
{"text":"Restaurant directement dans le palais des congrès. Nous avons été reçu de façon très courtoise et le service durant le dîner a été très rapide. Les deux repas que nous avons pris était succulents et frais. Nous recommandons chaudement"}
{"text":"Service is terrible and very slow, I have never seen so many people walk in and take a table than leave 7 to 10 minutes later because no one approached them. We ordered a sandwich at lunch time and I think that they had time to go and kill a pork to get the bacon before I received my sandwich. Tomatoes were green like I had never seen one in my life... So this place will only survive because there are a lot of tourists at the Palais des Congrès but no one will eat there twice for sure."}
