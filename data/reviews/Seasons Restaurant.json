{"text":"Lousy service. Paid $5 for sparkling water offered to us by the wait staff right when we sat down. Small portions. Pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"Food is actually a 4 out of 5, but the manager/co-owner (will use the term manager further) is the reason I will not return again.

Went for lunch as a group in late October on a Monday, and since my first choice (Jonathans) is closed for lunch, we end up at Seasons.  I asked the manager for a listing of wines by the glass, seemingly an easy and reasonable request.  Most people like to know what wine they are choosing and what it costs.  The response was \"we gottta Cabernet, an Italian, a ...\". OK, not the way I like to consider my wines, but my business partner and I go along with it and order  glasses of Cabernet.  He comes back with a bottle of very marginal Cab (Bogle) with the cork stuck back in.  I ask him when the bottle was opened, and he tells me it was yesterday.  If I have lost you on the significance of this last part, just go on to the next review, but if you are with me, you will also be annoyed that the manager is trying to sell me yesterday's fully oxidized and crappy tasting wine.  When I tell the manager that consuming yesterday's opened wine is not something we are prepared to do, he give me a \"ooh then we'll make sure to get you a freshly opened bottle of wine\" with a smartass smirk on his face.  I tell him that his attitude is condescending and inappropriate and he gets more professional and realizes that I am not too happy.  He brought out a bottle of a decent cab and it was fine.

The food itself was good, but the experience with the manager was really disappointing.  I will not return to this restaurant and continue to direct our sizable business related meal spend to Jonathans, which would never try a stunt like the manager here did.  Your actions do have consequences."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere!

Ask for bread it's delicious with butter.

One of our favorite place to eat in Oakville."}
{"text":"Top notch service. Food is delicious. Ambiance is beautiful!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for year. The proprietors George and Tammy greet you warmly and regulars get recognized for their return business. They have a great wine cellar, great food and the staff are great as well. They have grown over the years adding a large party room upstairs and a small one downstairs. This unfortunately has cost them the \"quaint\" feel. I still enjoy going whenever I can ..."}
{"text":"Recently I went with a friend to celebrate. The food is great and hence the 2 star. I was very disappointed with the service. The waitress walked by our table 4 times and did notice that we had finished our meal but made no attempt to clear the table. And this was a weekday. I found the waitress's attitude towards us simply rude. Would not go back or recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"We bid and won at a charity event a 10 course dinner with wine pairings for 10 people. This was very generously donated to the charity by the owners of Seasons Restaurant. We were served in the beautiful private room downstairs. The service, food, wine, and presentation were faultless. The owners skimped on nothing to make the event so memorable. We crawled out of there at 1.00 a.m."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times. Great service and good selection on food. The staff is pretty nice and the owner, George is also very nice. They have private dinning rooms for big groups which is nice to be alone from the rest of the restaurant. Whenever I go I have gone I have an enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"The food was good, but nothing special. Big plates with small portions, but that was to be expected.
The service was pretty bad. When asked for wine, the waiter left to get (what I presumed would be a wine menu) but instead returned with a filled glass of wine. I hadn't even told him what type of wine I wanted. 
There was mold on one of the raspberries in my salad. 
There was no bread on the table, and when I asked for some the waiter returned with a tiny plate of five flimsy pieces of bread. After requesting a refill, the second batch of bread was grilled. The first batch was not. Pretty inconsistent. 
Was kept waiting around very long for the bill (don't know why, because it was very quiet).
It's a pretty good atmosphere with okay food, but the mediocre service ruined it all."}
{"text":"THEE BEST place to go for pasta. 

They've got it dialled. Perfect sauce to food ratio. 

Just the right amount of ingredient combination. A bit on the pricey side though, but this is expected from downtown oakville. Bill was $90 for two without wine and tip. 

Good place for anniversary dinner or to take both your parents for important announcements.

Place was quiet with pleasant piano music playing in the background. Neatly, decorated and very clean. Ive went here twice, service was excellent on both occasions. Go dressed up or you will feel embarrassed."}
{"text":"I had to listen to a really long winded story about mediocre food in small portions (not, high end small portions), severe allergy concerns not even attempted to avoid (how hard is it to not put strawberries on something, and seriously who forgets a strawberry allergy??)  and just terrible begrudging service at this restaurant. The conversation went on for almost ten minutes which is way too long to bother talking about something if it wasn't just an 'kind of bad' time, it must have truly been bad.  I had somewhere else I really needed to be but I had to keep hearing about the bad service from the owner. I know they won't write a review so I am because man, we're still talking about it."}
{"text":"This is a perennial favourite of the Oakville fine dining crowd. Good atmosphere and a creative menu with a robust wine list. The wine cellar has an intimate private dining room that will comfortably fit 8-10 for a special event. Great date spot.  Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Great good, nice service. Ordered a sesame crispy salmon flavoured with caramel and some walnut powder?a quite unique combination. The fish is also very fresh and soft. We enjoyed some desserts together. Everyone recommended cheese cake and another lemon something very much. Not too sweet, melt in your mouth quickly. The boss said these were from his wife. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took 2 hours for food with no explanation from the manager. Food was good tasting but very small portions. Defiantly a let down and will not recommend to food."}
{"text":"Good is great.  My boyfriend and I ordered a warm salad and steak to share and the already spilt it in the the kitchen for us.  The steak is the right doneness and the the meat is tender and juicy.  The warm salad is warm(obviously) and the salad green were still crunchy. Service are friendly and quick. I love the decoration especially the washroom. Lol"}
