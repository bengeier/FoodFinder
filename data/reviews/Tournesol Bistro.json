{"text":"It's hard to believe this place has so few reviews after being around for like two decades. I saw they had a Winterlicious prix fixe for $25 pp and since my partner and I live in the area, we just decided to have Friday night dinner there and booked a table for 8 pm (the same day). Arrived, and the atmosphere was comfortable, not too fancy. Wholly unpretentious, coat hooks on the wall beside our table for us only. Our order was taken, along with water and bread at our table in a flash. We did not order wine. Water was refilled with excellent consistency over the whole meal (it's the little things that I appreciate). We ordered the salad and crab cake for appetizer, beef bourguignon and duck leg for mains, finally date cake and chocolate mousse for dessert. Salad was a bit ho-hum, but the massive crab cake was a great start. It's a big fried fish patty, healthiness be damned! Salty frites (mixture of potato and sweet potato, a bit heavy on the salt) were on the table with all meals, another highlight, showing how this place just gets it. All restaurants should just do this by default. Date cake is highly recommended, my partner said she would go back to have date cake and wine. Beef and duck were nice hearty mains with equal parts meat and veggie, that left us with enough room for dessert. Beef was tastier in my opinion, not sure about the comment that it was dry and flavorless by the another reviewer here. We're not \"slow diners\", our plates were whisked away and we got our bill without asking. I never had a sense we were being rushed through our meal, as the place wasn't even full. Overall, I felt it was great value with near perfect service. The food wasn't jaw dropping, but we were very content."}
{"text":"I've been to Bistro Tournesol several times and its just a joy to dine there. The waiter and one of the owners is just wonderful. The place is small and intimate and a great place to go to with a few friends for a nice dinner.  Love the menu that is seasonal prix-fixe style menu and the food quality is excellent.  I've had a number of their menu items and you just can't go wrong!  Love the little bowl of frites that come with the entree.  Everything is fabulous...give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, it makes me a little sad to leave a three star review for this place. I've walked by for years and always meant to give it a try, and tonight was the night. 

To start, service was great - quiet night (Saturday) with only 8 of 28 seats filled at any point during the night, but we weren't rushed or ignored and they took great care of us. 

Atmosphere was nice. Restaurant had something on the board outside talking about 20 years in business, and I can tell you - it felt like the early 90s in there, but in the best possible way. Sade CD playing (joking, but it felt like that), exposed brick walls, French advertising prints on the walls. 

And, the food. The food was a little sad. Started with stale focaccia (olive oil and vinegar on the table - when was the last time you saw that?).  We had sweet potato croquettes to start, which were fine, but indifferent. I had the escargot next, which were dried out, but wife's garlic soup was wonderful. 

Big disappointment was the mains - wife's boeuf bourguignon was dry and flavourless (the latter I thought was impossible with that dish). My lamb shank was under seasoned and dry, though the grains it was served with were great. 

After that, we didn't have the heart to order dessert, sadly. Hoping this restaurant can find it's mojo again for the next 20 years."}
{"text":"Another special evening at the Bistro. It was a repeat experience for us but we brought a friend from the Big Apple who we knew would enjoy a beautiful meal in Toronto.  

We each had a first course entree ranging from the daily soup (can't remember but tasty),  Spring salad and herb-tomato crepe. Incredible on all levels. Great flavour and feshness to their ingredients. 

Main courses were provimi veal liver (cooked medium rare), salmon (parchment paper) and steak (medium-rare). Beautiful. 

We shared a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (New Zealand)... very flavourful and complementary to our meals.

We ended with sharing the date(-chocolate) square and creme brulee. The square was moist amd dense. The creme brulee was very creamy and slightly sweet. Truly complementary to each other. There was a small selection of cut strawberries on the side (or on top) of each dessert.

Beautiful evening. Thank you."}
{"text":"I really like the food at Tournesol - it's very nice, basic French food done well.

It is fairly expensive, though, so if you're the kind of person that needs to have an OMG experience at a certain price point then you're at risk here because this place is more simple excellent, rather than \"life changing experience\"."}
{"text":"Went to Tournesol for dinner during Summerlicious.

Tournesol is a small restaurant near Bathurst & DuPont street - it probably only seats 30-40 people - so reservations would be recommended.

Both the Summerlicious menu and the regular menu feature French-bistro inspired items (escargot, confit) with a touch of international flare (panko crusted sea bass).

My understanding is that it is always a seasonal prix-fixe style menu - even so the menu is extensive and has room for much variety.

Dinner was great - the cedar plank salmon was well prepared and served with steamed vegetables and a light infused olive oil.  A nice tomato and caper salsa was great on toasted baguette.

The service was very attentive and the atmosphere very comfortable (clean and bright).  This would be a great place for a casual dinner or even a romantic night out (once the sun sets).

I would definitely return to Tournesol."}
{"text":"Do you ever drive by that place in your neighbourhood for many months and say, \"Hey, we've GOT to try that place some time\". This is exactly what happened to me and my wife several weeks ago, and we've now had two incredible suppers at Bistro Tournesol .

Bistro Tournesol offers a Prix Fixe-only menu, which is refreshing because you know you're getting the best the chef has to offer at a great price. $29.00 gets you an appetizer and a main course, which ranges from the simple bistro-style faire to the avant garde French cuisine one would expect in the outer quarters of Paris.

Oysters from Toronto's famed OYSTER BOY; Escargot \"a la Bourgignon\"; and house-made Duck Terrine whet the appetite on the first course, while my two picks for the second course included \"Rare-Roasted Duck Breast\" and \"Panko-crusted White Bass Fillet\", both extremely delicate and not overpowering to the palate, paired well with a New Zealand (Otago) Pinot Noir from their well-priced wine list.

Bistro Tournesol is a quaint little spot that makes you feel warm and welcome and their Martinis are spot-on and delivered to the table promptly as you peruse their economical, lively two-page menu. They are a great option for Tarragon Theatre pre-show diners, but this place is so lovely that you should make a date with someone you love and reserve a table as soon as humanly possible. $150 will get two people a two-course meal, Martinis and a spectacular bottle of wine...
