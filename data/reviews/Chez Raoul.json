{"text":"this is a lovely, charming sandwich bar, patisserie, coffee shop, & mini-grocery with regular/'foodie' staples--and all this, but also cute and delicious, at 1980 Wellington, corner Charon. the proprietors make kick-*ss espresso, allonges and americanos, fresh boulangerie bread with delicious fresh meat/cheese/veggie toppings, and there are a few tables inside as well as an area to relax out front. bring your laptop or tablet and your appetite--for some relaxing snack time, as well as delicious takeaways if you'd like. 100% will return again and again."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee place in point Saint Charles  Not much around here so it's quite convenient. The prices for coffee it's quite reasonable and good flavour. They are limited in supplies but it's still new in the area. It definitely looks like they are improving there stock and quantity daily. I had a croissant and it was quick tasty. I noticed they make sandwiches too (next time) I like that that offer individual fruits on the go for under a dollar.  They seem to be trying to become a convenient store and coffee shop. Two in one where it's most needed..  I hope this works out and worth dropping in for a quick peek!"}
