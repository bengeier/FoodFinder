{"text":"Great little spot for Taiwanese appetizers and dishes. The couple that works in the front are both so sweet and food does not take long. Great prices are everything! Little snacks are all $2, all drinks are $2-4, and everything is really delicious. My favourites are the watermelon juice, kiwi slush, stinky tofu, deep fried cheesy pork chop and the cheese tornado fries. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place today with a friend and my friend recommended the tornado potatoe. As much as I love these, I had to give it a try. There are many flavours you can chose from including regular, spicy, bbq and they also have cheese however it's not on the menu. We had the cheese and spicy one. The price is alrite too compared to if you buy from vaughan mills or CNE. It was 2 for 5.50 plux tax came up to be $6. One bite into the cheese one, it was so yummy! I would definately go back here again. There is also seating here however it's not the most nice scenic place to eat in."}
{"text":"Huge size. Typical bbt joint. But bubble tea is super sweet even I tell them I want minimal syrup.... I can't taste the tea feeling yet I taste pure sugar in my mouth. Flop. 2 star for service"}
{"text":"This rating is strictly for their popcorn chicken (juicy, tender, and tasty) and honey milk green tea. The popcorn chicken was excellent and very reasonably priced at $4.99. The honey milk green tea was a little watered down and the tapioca balls were a little over cooked but for $2.99 for a small who can complain?! Other than these minor things, I would've given this place 5*."}
{"text":"Rating is strictly for their Watermelon juice.

I LOVE fresh watermelon juice anywhere. It's just a summer drink that cools you down asap and is extremely yum yum to my tum tum :) .

The lady didn't speak English and asked if I could speak Chinese instead. She had no idea what I was saying so she gave me a copy of the menu and I pointed at what I wanted which was Fresh Watermelon Juice~

I'm always skeptical about \"fresh\" juices but was happy when an actual watermelon was pulled out and made into my juice :) !!

Definitely recommend this place for their fresh juices but not sure about their food or anything else~"}
{"text":"Really small taiwanese food and drink stall. Have been here twice. The fried twist potato stick is really good. I've tried original, bbq and spicy, they're all good and are now only $2 each. Original price was $3.50 but i don't think they are worth that price. The drinks are ok, they are only $2 for small, $3 for med and $4 for large. Tapioca and jelly are an extra 50c. The staff are pleasant and friendly. Not tried the rice bowls because we have always eaten before we come here. And seating is really limited too. Better to grab something and walk around."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for a while, and I finally did today. I was only able to get one item though but I will be coming back for more next time.

I ordered their Taiwanese sausages for $4.50. I found them surprisingly sweet and tasty. Wait time for food was a bit on the long side, but I guess it was worth it.

Would come back to try other items. They have quite a large selection of snacks and drinks.

{"text":"Hit and miss here. Ordered three things to go last night. Got the pork chop stuffed with cheese ($4), the Taiwanese stinky tofu ($4 - size large), and the salt and pepper deep fried tofu ($2.50). 

The meh:
The pork chop was small for $4, and most of the cheese had come out of the pork chop. What remained made for a salty pork chop. Wouldn't order this one again. The stinky tofu was not stinky. It was more like deep fried tofu drowned in sweet chili Thai sauce with a smattering of cabbage. Portion was fair for $4, and it was okay tasting, but it was not what I was expecting when I ordered. 

The great:
Love the salt and pepper deep fried tofu. It's tiny cubes of tofu deep fried until super crispy, tossed in a good amount of salt and pepper, and served in a paper bag with skewers for you to grab tofu with. I think the method of serving this is cute. The portion was not bad for $2.50. I would definitely order this again. This might just become my go-to snack option at Pacific Mall. I'd call this a cheap and delightful snack."}
{"text":"This very, tiny stall at pmall has a lot to offer! They offer takoyaki, brick toast, bubble tea and a whole variety of other Taiwanese snacks. 

Upon ordering, I got my food super quick too. Everything was delicious, I couldn't be happier. The takoyaki was great (could have used larger octopus pieces but I find most places in Toronto skimp out on the octopus), the bricktoast was fantastic and the bubble tea was alright but if you were really picky about bubbletea, there are tons of alternatives in and around the mall. 

I'm only disappointed I walked past this place so many times without giving it a chance. Will definitely head back!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 rice entrees, stinky tofu, bbq squid skewers and 2 teas today.  rice entrees were good but we like Papa Chang express better.  Squid skewers tasted good.  Teas were nice.   Tapioca just the right chewiness.

Good price for stinky tofu.  We ordered 6 pieces to try but we knew it would not be stinky enough since you can't smell it like if you went to wei's or mei nung.  But still nice to have the option at P-mall.

Service was good and efficient.  Saw others ordering tornado potatoe.  Looks good.  Will try again.  Nice that they have their own seating area apart from the crowded food court area."}
{"text":"I go all the time, their very nice and always welcoming. The food is delicious! Definitely try the potato twist and the sweet potato."}
{"text":"Excellent place and a hidden gem in the food court of the Pacific Mall.  It is a good choice for light Taiwanese snacks.  They have lots of goodies that you would want to eat.  Can be hard to find seating at times.  But be patient and you should find seats opening up.  

I saw other people eating food from this stall and it caught my attention.  Food is excellent.  You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"My third visit to this place. It's located on Heritage town of the second floor of Pacific Mall. Sell mostly taiwanese snacks. I usually order combo 2. Taiwanese chicken nuggets. Comes with rice and some vegetables and a small bubble tea. Reasonably priced and tasty."}
{"text":"Honey Bear is a great alternative to Taste of Asia, especially when you're craving these snacks at a time when the night market isn't running. I've tried their tornado potatoes before and they were good, and today I ordered their sweet potato fries ($3.00 before tax).

I can't complain too much about the portion size (a big handful), but I was hoping for a better bang for my buck. I guess not. Their fries are good, though, and should satisfy your craving well enough.

Staff are nice, but keep in mind that they may not speak English."}
{"text":"Guess who's back,
Back again
I am back! With a friend (ok..well boyfriend).
This has become our favourite munchie spot whenever we feel too poor and lazy to go all the way to Guu. They have tons of delicious snacks ranging from $2-$7? How amazing is that?! 

I highly recommend:
- Popcorn Chicken (so soft and juicy)
- BBQ Tornado potato (hit or miss. Sometimes they make it really good with a lot of seasoning, but sometimes it's undercooked and comes with barely any seasoning)
- Takoyaki (decent)
- Watermelon juice (always fresh and sweet)

So this weekend they added a new addition to their menu! Finally! Fried squid!! Oh boy oh boy! It's hugeee. Reminds me of the one at CNE and I remember it was reeeeeally good. Unfortunately, Honey Bear's did not even come close to the one at CNE. I was so sad! You can see the oil dripping right out onto the plate, the batter was not crisp enough nor did it stick to the squid. It fell right off after the first bite. On top of that, there was some weird spice in the squid. I didn't like it too much. But you know what? I'll still order this the next time I'm craving for some fried squid. Because where else am I going to find this around here?! Please please please start making blooming onions too!"}
{"text":"I kind of feeling sorry for Honey Bear.

Maintaining a Taiwanese BBT and food drinks inside Pacific Mall is never easy with all these competition is not easy. And Honey Bear is at a serious disadvantage with its location inside P Mall.

Located in the far end inside the \"Heritage\" area of P Mall. It is not the most convenient location for people just to get a bubble tea. And before getting there, you might have walked passed over 10+ other bbt places.

There are quite a good selections of drink and even snacks. $5 tax in for both of our drinks which is on special. I did enjoy my Kiwi Slush and my friend's Honey Aloe was decent too. And they even have Durian milkshakes and ice.

It is definitely nice to have a separate seating area from the main area but the place was just filthy! The floor was so sticky and tables so dirty when it was not even busy?! Maybe a bear with its jar of honey just came for some BBT?"}
{"text":"The prices here are really good. There is a small sitting area on the inside of this \"store\" (it's more like a counter and some chairs/tables), but it's situated at the back of a food court, so you have your pick of seats. I think that compared to bigger name bbt places (ex: Chatime), their drinks aren't as good but you are paying like half the price and their menu is pretty extensive (also includes actual food). The popcorn chicken is pretty good from what I remember and is decently priced. 

I mostly speak English, so there is minimal communication with the employees, but they have never been rude or demeaning to me. They do their jobs quickly and that's all I can really ask for.

Honey Bear isn't the best place to eat or have drinks, but they are well priced for what they are and could be faring a lot better if not for their location."}
