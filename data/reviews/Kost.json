{"text":"Cool. I LOVE PAYING $20 for 5 pieces of pasta swimming in lemon water, and extremely slow service."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stopping by this as part of a wine tasting event and was thoroughly impressed. The location is amazing, phenomenal views, good service and good food. I had the trout salad and it was done absolutely perfectly. I rarely order fish when dining out because they never make it as well as I do, but this was an exception. It was delicious, tender and tasty. It is pricey and there wine prices are high, so beware."}
{"text":"Avocado smash is done well at this restaurant up-top the 44th floor.

The restaurant has a cool vibe and in the summer brunch on the patio is stunning!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the outstanding service and lively ambiance. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had and the avocado toast is a must try. My water nor coffee cup ever reached half empty. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me for our Anniversary to Kost and boy let me tell you they made me feel like a Queen! Not only did they take our coats for us and take them to coat check, they brought us two glasses of champagne on them! It was excellent Champagne. They also gave us an intimate and romantic table that had the BEST view of the CN Tower. 

The decor and atmosphere made it seem like we were somewhere down South like Miami. 

We ordered the cheese to start which was the BEST cheese I have EVER tried. They make it in house and serve it with truffle, agave and grapes. We also got the calamari and for the price and portion it was PERFECT. So fresh and so tasty! For our main, we got the Baja fish tacos which was to die for! Served on a a full fish, I felt like it came straight out of the ocean. 

This is a MUST try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Brunched on a Saturday.  Service was slow, inattentive.  30% of the tables around us were food/lifestyle bloggers with cameras out.  A great view and beautifully designed restaurant but they definitely need to get their service in order."}
{"text":"Great decor, food not so great. It's defiantly not a Mexican place as advertised. It's a Californian tapas style. I got the tofu and it was burnt at the bottom, and the fries were the small crispy over dried bits at the end. The staff and service was prompt and the view is amazing. Just go for the drinks once the patio opens up? Just a thought."}
{"text":"I hosted my birthday dinner of about 8 or 9 ladies here and booked the reso very last minute as there was a cancellation/ reservation mix up at the Broadview hotel where I initially planned it. KOST was honestly so much better (I later went to the Broadview which I loved also)(( but you can read their review at another time haha)). This is a great place to get a bunch of items to share because everything is so good!!! Their service is also impeccable and the view is stunning! Located on the rooftop of Torontos boutique hotel Bush's, KOST is a must try! Pictured are a few of my favourite items!! The tuna ceviche and pico di galo  happy eating."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, price is comparable to other brunch places $14-$18. Give this five stars for the atmosphere and the view. View is to die for, you can see all of downtown core and cn tower. Although it was -30 outside that it hurts to walk around, the sun and floor to ceiling windows on a nice sunny Saturday made it feel like summer all over again. The servers were also super nice and allowed us to chat and soak up the sun for another hr after we paid.

Would definitely want to come back at night for the night view and in the summer for patio weather and we can see this view outside."}
{"text":"The old Trump tower is reborn with an amazing location beautiful world class views. The only issue is the staff and value doesn't compliment the establishment. From the moment we walked in...it was about 40% full. No big deal...maybe just the time. Sat down they brought us a menu we asked about the bar items you know your basic $19 salad? (  ^ ^ ) seems the staff made a mistake, got us another menu... no big deal. So after studying the second menu for 15 min we asked about 2 top two items. \" Oh sorry we are out of those items\" Being a limited short menu we decided to opt out of eating and just have a glass of sangria as we noticed a nice pitcher of it behind the bar. As our server was filling our order she took wine glass and filled with ice to the point it was so full at first we thought maybe she is just chilling the glass. You know when someone makes a martini they pack the glass to the point where the ice is almost spilling over. In our case the glass was completely full exactly to the top. Next thing we know our bartender is filling it with Sangria!?!? Hey would you please take 1/2 the ice out of the glass please? \"Sure no problem she remarked but this is how we measure our pour she remarked\" We are talking about Sangria here...wine soda and fruit/juice right? In posting this review we noticed others complaining about portion size. Needless to say we left and opted out of the Sangria. Probably a blessing in disguise as if this place is hurting that much that they cannot afford to pour .93 cents of Sangria into a proper wine glass portion we can just imagine the food. There's simple no need for this today, we're not expecting trucker proportion but simple some basic value. We left annoyed and it was more then evident that this is another one of those over staffed pretend busy restaurants that think their doing you a favour for allowing you to eat there. Much to be learned here. Chapter 22x2=44th floor of Kost. Not impressed and definitely would never go back."}
{"text":"Loved the venue and the view but disliked the service. Came here for my sister's 30th with a table of 9. Our server was nice but did forget some orders. Also, one of the staff (wearing black) almost took one of our tables away cause she wanted to seat other guests even though the place was literally half empty with plenty other seats to accommodate others. The staff kept on reminding us we only had our table until 9 pm. I understand that and they told us in the beginning which was fine. However, to keep reminding us throughout the night was rude. It's as if they wanted to tell us to leave now. Sigh... we wanted to like the place though. Food was mostly good but they need to improve their service. Don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"It's so pretty in here! It has a laid back beach vibe. Staff are nice, food is tasty and different. I had the K?st breakfast and my husband had the Green Chorizo and Egg Bowl. Came here for a birthday brunch and they gave us a complementary salted caramel ice cream dessert. Yum . Will try to come back again on a weekend for brunch."}
{"text":"Did a reservation to go with 2 friends for a Sunday morning brunch.
Since the moment we got into the hotel, the amazing experience at KOST started, the eggs Benedict with smoked trout ($15) were amazing!!
Service could not have been any better...
Coffee was okay."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch at noon and the place was about 70% full. Nicely decorated with a nice view of the skyline from all sides. Food was very average, something I could probably make at home. My plate looked half eaten...."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of my girlfriends celebrating a birthday. The food was great. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share including: smashed avocado, fried calamari, baja fish tacos (group favourite), green chorizo meatballs (my personal favourite), tuna ceviche and charcoal roasted guajillo shrimp. All of these were super tasty and great for sharing in terms of portions. 

To top it all off - you get an amazing view on the city and the rooftop pool. 

I highly recommend this restaurant. Perfect for girls night (or even date night)!

In the picture, you see the tuna ceviche, calamari and Baja fish tacos."}
{"text":"It was ok. 

I mean I guess the view is nice? I had a window seat (we did leave a note on the reservation requesting a window seat, but upon arrival, did not get the seat we requested. It was not at all full, so we requested the window seat after being seated, in which they accommodated). But in front of the window is the pool deck, with many other seats, chairs and people taking photos. So, its nice... but with some... obstructions. I did not go out to the deck after, so maybe if I did, my mind would have changed. 

In terms of the food. It was ok. Not mind blowing. My potatoes did look alittle... dark. 

The service was fine. Coffee was refilled periodically. They did the thing again where they give you the bill without you asking. Maybe this is a norm in Toronto? Not sure. 

It was cool to go once. but thats about it."}
{"text":"Great view and very cool vibe. Had dinner with another couple and everything was awsome. We shared everything and the food and service were outstanding. The outdoor area is awsome and pool is awsome......great job Charles!"}
{"text":"Bring your platinum card, this place is pricey.  

That being said, the view, atmosphere and quality of the food and cocktails is phenomenal.  The pool is slightly awkwardly located, but definitely adds to the stunning views over the city and waterfront.  

All the salads are fantastic and well layered.  The skewers are well cooked and seasoned.    It don't forget to leave room for desert and the delightful tres leches."}
{"text":"Brunch and view are AMAZING but there is a major miscommunication between the hostesses and management. On several occasions I have been told that you can NOT reserve spots on the rooftop on Sunday brunch, but you get turned away at the door due to reservations or sent to the bar, while multiple tables are left empty."}
{"text":"4 stars for breakfast, 3 stars for dinner! Avocado toast was SO amazing! Loved so much that I went back a second day. I'd get there around 7AM and would be the only one there. Great views of the CN Tower!

Dinner was loud and service was slow. Halibut was dry and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"From the 44th floor so close to the CN tower with a gorgeous pool. the view alone is worth coming here. It has tables and lounge pods, the interior was also beautiful with lots of light wood, the vibe was great. 

A reservation was made for 4 people at 9.30pm, when I was getting in they were starting to form a short line for the night. Went inside and was given a plastic card to take the elevator up. There was a bit of confusion at the elevator about our reservation. We made it up 10 minutes later. We stood at the front waiting for a hostess for a while, we were greeted by at least 3 different people but still haven't gotten a table, it seemed to be disorganized and overbooked. We were told we would be getting table but everyone seemed to be just walking around not knowing what to do. 

Another 10 minutes pass by and we are still standing there, at this point we were standing around for almost 20 minutes. A manager came by (or someone with an earpiece) and acknowledged we have been waiting around and was unhappy with the staff, but he had the audacity to say \"We have the most beautiful hostess but she is also the stupidest\" and went on to tell us how he thought she was dumb. I was appalled that he said that to us! CASUAL MISOGYNY just being thrown around especially to paying customers. I can understand that he was upset but it was just hard to stomach. 

We finally got a table, an amazing corner table with a wrap around view. I got the meatballs for $14, the price was very good for a place like this. It came with lots of crispy pita with a savoury tomato sauce. The meatballs were hot and were a good portion size. I was pleasantly surprised. I also got a cocktail for $18, which was fine it was good. 

We also got chicken skewers for the table to share. I bit into my piece and it was completely RAW on the inside! We returned the chicken and were not charged for it and we were given 2 desserts instead. We got the tres leche cake, which was great it was really moist. And the panna cotta which was soooo good, it came with kiwi and pineapple. It was refreshing and sweet I would order this again. 

Our server at our table was extremely nice, much better than the other service we have received from any one else. By the time we were leaving almost midnight they were no longer letting people in. 

I want to like this place so badly but there were just so many faults that night from the raw chicken but especially the man who called their hostess stupid out loud to customers. I would love to come back but have a hard time support a restaurant that feeds into sexism."}
{"text":"Been living in Toronto for 2 years now and I can honestly say this is my favorite lunch spot in town! The atmosphere is priceless and the food is simply great. I love just being there and enjoying the view. The interior is just amazing and on nice sunny days, it honestly feels like a dream. Would go back forever! Totally recommend for a cool lunch outing in town"}
{"text":"Skip the food--it's utterly lacklustre. Come for the drinks, the decor, the view. 

If you do end up here for brunch, ask for some hot sauce and liberally use the salt and pepper. 

Other notes: Coconut pancakes were decent. And totally request for more cream (no extra charge). Service is warm and friendly. Coffee is bottomless."}
{"text":"Came here for a Christmas dinner with my colleagues. It's a very posh place and definitely not cheap. We shared a bunch of appetizers and each had a dish for ourselves. I got the branzino which 2as delicious, but one of my colleagues got the tofu and wasn't that impressed with it. The view and service were great. I wouldn't recommend this for a sit down dinner, but it's a nice place for drinks and apps with friends if you don't mind splurging."}
{"text":"Food was great. I wanted to try this place before it became the next big Toronto rooftop lounge & restaurant. The rooftop terrace with pool is gorgeous and the view of Toronto is great. Ambiance is 10/10 and service is very attentive. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the portions are a bit too small for the price. Be prepared for a pretty high bill if you came hungry. I knew this going in so it was exactly what I expected. For 2 people, you'll definitely need to order 2-3 full-size dishes or 3-5 half-size dishes.  The truffle fries, quinoa salad and prawns were amazing, definitely recommend trying those."}
{"text":"Kost (pronounced coast) is a pretty trendy spot with it's gorgeous views of the city and the CN tower. Definitely a place for a photo op but as a few have said skip the food and get one drink! 

First off, we did come with no reservation and they said it would be a 30 minute wait. Hmm not too bad at all! We happened to bump into some nice guys where we joined their table to wait. Their table was located in a non-umbrella area outside. It was an excruciatingly hot day and we had to ask the servers several times for water! The heat was so unbearable that we asked multiple times to be moved to empty seats that were inside. We were told that they were taken. We had been there for 30 min and the tables still weren't taken. The hostess was very dishonest and not helpful at all! 

Finally my friend went back to the hostess and she refused to accept \"no\" for an answer and so we were moved to table in a cooler area near the pool but still no shade. I had asked the waiter to be moved previously and he said no because it gets too confusing for the tables. Ummm is it that hard to move one group to another table that you are also waiting? Mind you we never had a table we had just crashed a random group's table. 

Kost seems very poorly organized. It isn't that big and the waiters were huffing and puffing about moving tables that were in their seating area. In addition, it took forever to get water. I mean it's a 30 degree day with no umbrella and no water. Do you want lawsuits on your hands? Give a table a jug of water! It's not that big of a deal. Also the bathrooms are on the 43rd floor just below Kost (44th floor)! How does that work?!

Eventually we got sick and tired of roasting in the sun and as soon as a group beside us moved, we took over the table despite what every person in the restaurant told us not to do and guess what? No one even blinked an eye. Ridiculous!

On to the food: I would say Kost it's pretty sad in terms of food. The pancakes looked straight from my kitchen. These aren't the fluffy buttermilk pancakes from Mildred's Temple Kitchen, they're just sad flat pancakes with some fruit on top. For myself, I got the breakfast burrito and it was salty and lacking real flavour and dare I say egg? I mean isn't that supposed to be the main ingredient? The scrambled egg also seemed fake and artificial like the egg you get at McDonald's. 

The mimosa I ordered was delicious but was it worth $15???!!!! I would have to say no! We waited a ridiculously long time for our drinks and even longer for our food. It didn't seem that busy and there were lots of servers and chefs cooking up a storm in the restaurant. Would I go back for food? Hell no! Would I go back for a drink? Maybe. Would I go back for the view and ambiance? Yes. The only reason the place gets a second star."}
{"text":"Attended a friend's birthday here. There were some complications about being seated near the window so we could get a view of the city. 

However, the staff was very accommodating and nice enough to move us to the area we initially requested.
This is the perfect place to take anyone on a date or to catch up with your best pals. It is absolutely beautiful, situated on the 44th floor of the BISHA hotel.

I can already tell this place will become a hit in the summertime for its rooftop views. The patio was not open at this time. The food is reasonably priced. I had the Panela bowl which contains: cheese, corn, quinoa, chickpea, and cherry tomatoes (brunch menu). The drinks, however, are costly. We ordered mimosas for 18 dollars a glass.
The décor is warm and inviting. It is most beautiful on a sunny day - with its exposure to sunlight through the tall windows that surround the entire place.

I will definitely be coming again for a girls day out!"}
{"text":"This is such a poor experience in my life time. One star is even more than what we want to give.
Table was book by the owner Charles thru my boy. Services was extremely poor the girl who served us had very bad attitude. 
But we got stuck in the elevator for an hour and no one came help. And we have to call 911.
When we came back the girl who served us just throw our bday cake on the table and it's cold. 
Will never recommended to anyone again or come back. With the food was meh with the price"}
{"text":"The view from the 44th floor is what makes this place stand out! You can get a panorama view of Toronto.

I also love the vibes here. Super vacation like and relaxed!

I didn't have high expectations of the food because many people said it sucked but to its defence, it was actually not horrible! We came for brunch. Though the food was your typical brunch items and nothing special, they didn't screw anything up! It tasted pretty decent.

Service here sucks. Starting from the reception/reservation to the actual waiter. They knew nothing about the place or anything on the menu. The waiter didn't even know the price of a mimosa! 

Also, he disappeared for basically the entire meal and then took forever for us to pay. Even when we were paying...he left somewhere for 10 minutes and handed the machine to us to take care of. Kind of ridiculous!

Well...even though the service here sucks, I'll still be back because it's a rare gem in the city to have such a nice view!"}
{"text":"Too overpriced for less than average food. Waiting time for food is too long. The view is nice, but that's all."}
{"text":"Kost is such a special place. Makes you feel like you've left Toronto to be on a resort in a sunny place! We recommend going during brunch on a nice day because it's a beautiful and bright view of downtown Toronto. 
The food was good. The staff were very kind. They take your jacket for you right when you arrive and are very friendly."}
{"text":"I am at a loss of words as to what to even say about this place. My husband and I came by here with another couple and were not even allowed past their \" fancy\" velvet ropes. We had read really good things about the view and the food so we called ahead and asked if they had any tables, it was later so they said yes we do. Overly excited we got into a taxi and came here. The bouncer looked at us up and down and got very defensive for no reason. We had told him we called ahead and he immediately turned us down and said that wasn't true and basically told us no we couldn't be allowed in. I literally am loling about it because we watched groups of girls in tight jumpsuits be allowed in before us. Apparently we were too \"underdressed\" the way they presented it to us was oh sorry we have nothing available for you!! Ok to the guy who is a bouncer you take your job way too serious. You open a velvet rope and let girls in skimpy clothes walk by you. Had high expectations for this place but after that experience I would never recommend anyone here. Btw I am a foodie and live in NYC area and have been to very nice establishments, never been treated like this ever."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing this place featured on a Toronto blog on Instagram (the usual) and thought the views and food looked amazing. It was rainy and slightly foggy upon our arrival but the bright atmosphere and palm trees inside the restaurant made it feel like it was a warm, sunny day. 
Knocked off one star because the service, as some other reviews state, was AWFUL. It took forever to order and took a while for the food to come out.
I get hangry, and definitely was hangry while waiting for my food.
Luckily the food was good- i got the Mojo de Ajo Tofu, and never knew tofu could taste that good. It was topped with mushrooms, onions, and chermoula - it was seasoned perfectly. 
My sister got the branzino, and although i'm not the biggest fan of branzino, i found it quite enjoyable. 
We also got shishito peppers and fries as sides and while nothing to write home about, they were still enjoyable. 
K?st itself is located inside Bisha Hotel which is hella swanky and very modern.
In conclusion, food is good, nothing new or exciting, but basic fare with a great view. 
If you need some new Instagram pics, this is probably your best bet in Toronto."}
{"text":"Kost is located inside the Bisha hotel. Parking is available nearby or on the street. 

We went there for lunch this past long weekend. We went there thinking they would have their brunch (as advertised on their social media) but were a bit disappointed to learn that it was only lunch. 

I ordered the tuna steak sandwich with a side of salad. It was a pretty good portion and the dressing on the sandwich was really good! My friend got the octopus and she loved it. The place was gorgeous - nice and open concept! 

Wish the weather had been less cloudy - the view is supposed to be gorgeous. Overall it's a bit pricey for lunch/dinner but brunch seems like a good option (under $20). 

Also a good spot to hang out with a couple of friends at the bar! It seems like a great spot to hang out in the evening/night time!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting the world coming to this restaurant but our server Tamara was exceptional. We were a large group (9) of ladies out for our friend's birthday and not the easiest group to deal with. She was calm, cool, collected, and confident throughout our entire service. She gave great recommendations and guided our experience for those of us who were first-time diners. From a manager in the restaurant industry - I would be so proud to have someone like her on my team. 

Give this girl a raise."}
{"text":"SO cute and very asthetically pleasing. Located on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel. Got seated near the rooftop view. 

Didn't have a reservation but got seated at the bar while we waited. Only waited about an hour (which was okay because of the last minute decision to go)

Food was soooo delicious! I tried the avocado toast and the coconut pancakes. The toast was delicious and the cherry tomatoes weren't too sour and a good touch. The bread itself was cut thick to hold all the toppings put on the toast. Highly recommended. The coconut pancakes were so sweet and delicious, thin easily foldable pancakes topped with small dices of mango, pineapple and kiwi. It was also sprinkled with a coconut shreds. Very dessert tasting and if you have a sweet tooth in the morning/afternoon, I would recommended this.

Would love to come back for brunch again and maybe even dinner! Food was great and the restaurant was very beautiful."}
{"text":"The food and drink were really good and well-priced. For food, we tried the chorizo meatballs, the charred green beans and a short rib skewer. All the food was really good. I could have eaten the green beans all day, they were super addictive. The short rib skewer was super tender and the meat was delicious. We shared a pitcher of a tequila cocktail that was really tasty. The service was excellent.

The view can't be beat...the 44th floor patio is gorgeous and cozy - I love that blankets are available to keep you warm, and there are heaters as well. The variety of seating on the patio is great - beds, chairs and loveseats. Get there just before sunset and you will have the most amazing views.

This spot is perfect for a date, but also great to grab some food and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"From a pure aesthetic, fun-time perspective, Kost is strong - perhaps one of the best in the city, especially during a summer evening. 

Kost's business model is clear: they are optimizing for \"vibes\", or ambience. This draws in a certain clientele - those for whom food quality is a secondary concern. 

With that in mind, do take the average Yelp review in context. While Yelp reviewers are a fairly heterogeneous group, the median reviewer would likely think of food quality as their primary concern. 

The food quality here is ok, and I was disappointed by the menu. I was under the impression that Kost's menu was Baja-influenced - of which I only saw sparse representation.

If I were to judge every restaurant under the same context, Kost would likely be a 2-3 star restaurant. But more than anything, Kost provides a dining experience - not necessarily one that is constrained to the quality of its food. And for that, I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Disappointed with some of this restaurants policies. Inquired about a weekday lunch reservation for ~10 and was told they had a minimum per person of $55 all the way up to $85. For a place that has a regular lunch menu of roughly $14-$22, this really seems like a ridiculous cash grab. What is the actual reason you would have to charge double the price for a larger group? It's almost as if they're trying to penalize you for wanting to bring them more business... Anyway, my group of colleagues is only going to keep growing and sadly it looks like I won't be able to bring them here anytime soon for our monthly socials. Sad, because they do have that nice skyline view."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10

Service: 10/10 

Atmosphere: 10/10

Went here for a birthday brunch on a Saturday and all I can say is that this place is AMAZING. My friends and I made reservations and were promptly seated at a big couch near the windows with a breathtaking view of the CN tower and the lake. The entire restaurant is well lit with huge windows and has a very classy yet casual vibe. 

The service was here was on point-our server was very patient with our order and always came to check up on us. He also was super patient when we asked him to take a few picture for us! 

They don't have an actual coffee menu but they do offer a full espresso service. I tried their iced plain latte and it was honestly one of the best lattes I've had at a brunch place ever. Now down to the food - I ordered the eggs beny with smoked trout and roasted potatoes but my friends also ordered sandwiches and burgers. We all loved our food and would definitely some back during patio season. I highly recommend this place for brunch!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday celebration at Kost with 9 of my friends. I enjoyed the rooftop view however, the service was disappointing. The hostess was not so welcoming when we came in. We were repeatedly reminded that we only had our table until 9:00pm. It took a while to get our food. My girlfriend had to wait 30 mins for her appetizer while everyone else finished theirs. 3 of my friends were late so the lady asked if she can take away their seats. I did not appreciate that. We felt pressured to hurry outta there. I found it rude & unprofessional. Our server was fine. The food was nothing out of the ordinary & was quite expensive. This would be my first & likely last time here. Thanks for making my birthday special...."}
{"text":"Pros: 
-atmosphere and view of the city 
-drinks (they have an onsite wine sommelier, which is interesting) 
-tapas (food was good but overpriced - you're paying for the atmosphere)

Cons:
-while our waiter was friendly enough, whoever was the floor manager- man in grey suit- the night of the 21st was a dick. (We were still looking at the menu and he came over and told us our table was reserved at 930- it was 730 at the time- and so we better hurry up and order soon, which set the tone for a very rushed dinner. Who does that ?!) 

For such a supposedly high end restaurant, food wait times and overall service made the experience a one time ordeal."}
{"text":"Went with a group on nine for a Sunday birthday dinner and will definitely not return. Firstly, one of my girlfriend's appetizer was 30 minutes late. By the time it arrived, the rest of the party had already finished and were ready to order for our mains. The server tried to make a joke and it was not well received. They could've had the decency to give it to us on the house in order to redeem themselves, but sadly they did not.

With regards to the food, there was nothing exceptional, especially considering the price. I had order the peach salad (basically peaches with cream cheese), the green beans (I enjoyed this), and the lobster skewer (it was good, but the serving was tiny for $30). 

The service, sadly, was our party's least liked aspect of the experience. The wait times for our other orders, specifically the dessert, was long. In addition, after our allotted time was done, we were basically kicked out, despite the area being sparse, while also reminding us throughout our dining experience that we must leave after the certain time (they used the petty excuse that a large party was coming). 

Would not recommend, there are other restaurants with better service, better food, and a better view."}
{"text":"We stayed in the hotel. The restaurant is beautiful and the view incredible. The service was standout from start to finish. The menu is interesting and varied. We had the Branzino which was tender and nicely seasoned. The beet salad was a touch too acidic for our taste but he oysters were fresh and beautiful."}
{"text":"The view is amazing but the food is all crap. The wine is over priced and the food is nothing to write about. The Server did not even know how to carry plates or serve"}
{"text":"It was absolutely awful. 

Drink: Kost Sangria
Watered down. No taste. There was one orange slice, 2 thin strawberry slices, and 2 raspberries.  I wouldn't call this a sangria.  I would call this sprite with some fruit slices.

Appetizer: Tune Ceviche
It seems that the waiter forgot to tell me that there was a late delivery for the tuna and they didnt have this item ready when I ordered it.  Everyone else's appetizer came, save mine...and THEN i was told that it will be a few minutes. 30 minutes later the waiter comes back to say I owe everyone at the table a bite of my ceviche because they all shared their apps with me while i was waiting. When I made it clear that his joke was not funny, he told me it will be another few minutes. 5 minutes later, it finally came...when everyone else's plates had already been cleared; I should have been prepared that the portion size would be disappointing.  It was served with 6 nachos (toasted to the point of stale); I didnt need all 6 nachos.

Skewer: Short Ribs skewer, half portion
It was meat on a stick. nothing special.

Experience:
I will not be coming back. There were 2 wait staff that kept telling our group that they needed the table back at 9 p.m.....it was 7 p.m. Not to mention that the restaurant was half empty...even less than that.  It was incredibly expensive for the portions, mediocre presentation, even less so with taste, and downright appalling service.  I strongly DO NOT recommend this restaurant at this point.  I hope that they improve their service and food quality because at its current state, you're better off going to Canoe--same view, better service, better food."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner after my boyfriend's last exam to (mini) celebrate and really enjoyed the food here. 

I made a reservation, so luckily I was able to be seated asap. Of course the view was nice, but I didn't get one of the booths near the window. Besides the view, the decor was pretty minimal, boho chic which went great with the romantic environment.

The service could have been better, but maybe it was really busy??
The servers was really nice throughout our meal but were not quite that attentive. 

We started off with the Kost Sangria ($18) & the stella cider ($12)
Honestly, get the cider, skip the expensive af cocktails. Like my 20 dollar sangria was pretty good, but at like 20 bucks... nope

Food wise, they killed it, i loved everything.
The fried calamari ($15) came first and oh my godddddddd, it was the lightest batter I have ever had. Crispy, light and NOT greasy. highly highly recommend this. 

Charcoal grilled octopus ($19) was also done very well. I can't quite tell what the sauce was, but it was a great pair with the octopus. It was also cooked to a good tenderness level and was  not chewy and gummy like. Probably my least fave dish, but still a good dish.

Roasted Lamb Cutlets ($45) this was bit pricey.. but lamb ain't cheap so, i let it slide. If you can look aside the 50 bucks you're tossing, this dish was very well thought out. The pickled eggplant and yogurt puree really brought this dish over the top. The tangy pickled eggplant and vinegar was balanced by the yogurt puree. These flavours added a kick to the lamb and made this dish really memorable. 

Overall, I would come here again.. maybe for brunch. A little on the loud side though, but a good place to hang with your girlfriends or a date."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nestled on top of Bisha Hotel. I came here for lunch and was extremely disappointed. Tasteless salty calamari for $15.00++ ....everything else on the menu also non authentic and being marketed to your road side tourists. The view is not that grate either as windows overheads are blocking everything...this restaurant is definitely a skip for me."}
{"text":"This place was great. It is pricey but the view is amazing. Our reservation was for 730- it wasn't too busy and we enjoyed a non chaotic atmosphere. Servers were knowledgeable and friendly. Around 930 it picked up and was a bit more crowded and loud (to be expected  given it was a sat night ). Atmosphere was great, good music, great decor.

Service was exemplary - the sommelier made great recommendations. We shared our meals tapas style - Tuna and beer tartar, chickpea salad, beef and swordfish skewer . By far the tuna and beer tartar were my favorite. Tuna tartare has some watermelon in it along with other ingredients which catches the mouth palate in a positive way. They adjusted our salad to take out the corn nuts for my friend (which was very kind of them ..) as she did not enjoy the combination or the crunch with the salad. I personally enjoyed the crunch.

All in all a lovely night in a great restaurant. I enjoyed the restaurant when it wasn't too busy ... so if you want a quiet evening make reso before 830 - not sure what the vibe is like on other days."}
{"text":"One word: MEH. This place is a huge disappointment. All of the other Kabuth restos I've eaten in have excellent service and food that matches the price. We didn't even try the tacos because - $35-45 for TACOS?!?! When Toronto has an amazing authentic taco scene? I don't know what they were thinking. 

Anyway. Onto the food and service. When we arrived for our 7:30 reservation there were maybe 4 other tables of people. I ordered a glass of wine -a very small pour, may I add, for $16. It took far too long for the wine to come and our menus were closed and ready to order. The server dropped the wine at the table and rushed on, not asking or giving us a chance to say we were ready to order. 10 min later We ordered and shared a bunch of appetizers. 

Roast mushrooms $12: meh. They were ok. Quite salty
Beet salad $16: small serving for price. Flavourful strawberries but the flavours lacked any depth so tasted flat when trying all elements of dish in a mouthful. 
Beef tartare $18: worst tartare I've ever had. It came with 5 stale tasting corn chips and the beef was flat all over the plate. No attempt at presentation. And the beef smelled...off...you know that smell when you open a wrapper of beef from the supermarket and it has that blood soaked pad under it? That pad is what the beef smelled like. I couldn't eat more than one serving because of the smell. 
Charcoal roasted shrimp $19: this was by far the best dish but with 2 fairly large and 1 much smaller shrimp to the total of 3 shrimp - zero value. 
Tuna ceviche $18: this was the next best dish and had a lot of brilliant flavour and I loved the sweet little bites of watermelon. However this also came with 5 stale corn chips. 

I would have returned the tartare to the kitchen if we had had any level of service checking in on us but we ate our meal with no one even asking if we were enjoying it. At that point I'd given up and was somewhat testing them. 

For the above meal with one measly under-poured glass of wine, we paid just over $130 including tip for two people. Even the view and decor could not draw me back when I could have much better taco/Mexican a 5-10 minute walk away that would include margaritas for under $100."}
{"text":"Great views and good enough food - this place is going to be a busy spot and you're going to go see a looooot of Instagram pics geotagged here this summer.

Mains are priced fairly for the location and apps are a bit on the pricy side. Drinks here will add quickly. However, there are very few places in downtown where you'll get a similar ambiance.

I had an ahi tuna steak sandwich ($21) with the house salad. Portions were very fair and the house salad was actually tasty if you're looking to be opt for the healthy choice instead of fries.

The decor is very inviting and bright - Light wood, palm plants which is a big contrast to the dark and sleek lobby of the Bisha. 

I'll definitely be back on a sunny weekend for brunch but I reckon it's going to be hard to get a spot without making a reso."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Kost twice during our stay here in Toronto. The night view was nice but the service was terrible.

The second time we visited the waiter forgot the details of our orders. We asked for no olives in the Ahi Salad and  Mayo on the side for the one of the BLT sandwiches. We waited for 40 min for the food to come, and it came with a lot of olives in the salad, no mayo at all, and no bacon in the Kost Burger. The side we ordered was brought to us after we finished the meal...... and most shocking thing was we saw one of the bartender tasted the drink with stirring spoon and stirred the drink with the same spoon....like is this the really best quality for hotel rooftop restaurant ? Probably not."}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian white pasta. It was $19 and not worth it at all. Very bland nothing special. I also had their rose wine and it was bitter and tasted cheap unlike the price. Other than that this place is stunning. So beautiful with a great view of the city. It was very loud at night but I would return for the gorgeous view and it is the reason for my high star rating"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday. The ambience was amazing, the food was good and the service was out of this world! The servers were very polite and took care of us well. 

I ordered the Kost Burger which did not disappoint. The drinks are a little pricey but the view makes up for it."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food taste and small portions. BUT... I will definitely go back just because the atmosphere and view of the place is great."}
{"text":"\"The tacos, another recommendation from the server, provided initial sticker shock. A whopping $45 for duck tacos and $35 for short rib barbacoa tacos. Craving some tender meat, we settled on the barbacoa tacos. A huge platter with all the fixings arrived: chimichurri, shaved red onion, baby gem lettuce and fried shallots. We opened the basket of six soft-shell tacos that were cardboard-like in texture and were the opposite of malleable. What surprised me most of all is that Kost used flour tortillas instead of the more authentic corn variety. As for the barbacoa--Heaton was asleep when they taught this technique in culinary school. The fatty, but flavourful beef was sliced into thick strips instead of tender, fall-off-the-bone shreds.\""}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

I would come here early on a summer night and enjoy the view from the rooftop here. This place is known more so for its view of the city and the fact that you're on the rooftop. The doors open and the rooftop terrace space suddenly becomes bigger with the rooftop pool that ppl can swim in. I came right before it got too busy so we avoided lines downstairs and we got seated. 

It's generally packed in here on the winter days because the restaurant suddenly accommodates less people and a lot of ppl still want to come here for a drink or a bite. 

We came here for desserts. Unfortunately their freezer wasn't working so none of the desserts had ice cream accompanying the dessert and you can't order scoops of ice cream or sorbets. :(

I have to say despite no ice cream, the desserts we ordered tasted great. We had the chocolate molten lava cake and the tres leche cake. In comparison to the lava cake I had at Lee's, it's comparable! I actually liked the crunch I get from the edge of the cake. It would have been amazing if there was ice cream accompanying this cake, but I enjoyed it. The tres leche cake wasn't too sweet even though it had dulce de leche in here and the cake was very moist. Both desserts were delicious. 

At 9:30pm, this place was still very busy. Sometimes you want to spot some local celebrities too. I was fortunate to spot the hotels owner Charles Khabouth just walking around checking how the crowd is at the restaurant. This place was busy alright! Busy to the point there wasn't much room to stand or sit at the bar either! 

Overall, I'll come back here again to give their dinner menu a try!

LAST TIP?!

Make reservations. I can't emphasize enough about how busy this place gets and sometimes booking online is difficult. I suggest booking by calling or come one evening to make your reservation. Come check this restaurant out during the summer time when they open their full terrace and their pool and admire CN tower as your backdrop!! Also order their ice cream or sorbets because it's not your typical flavors you can try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday night for a girlfriend's birthday, with a party of 9. First impressions were great with a wonderful view and overall eye-pleasing decor. Unfortunately, that's how far the positive characteristics go. We will absolutely not be returning.

Food
Their entire menu was mediocre, not to mention quite expensive. My friend's tuna ceviche came almost an hour later than everyone else's orders. Instead of offering compensation for that by possibly making it on the house, all we got were displeasing jokes from our server, who basically teased her for having to share everyone else's food. 
They do not have the traditional portions and selection sizes for main courses, but instead have a variety of skewers, which are ridiculously steep in price for what you actually get. We had all tried the chicken ($14 a skewer), short rib ($20), lobster ($30), and shrimp ($26). All had about 4-5 pieces per skewer, and did not come with any sides. Some may assume that the price reflect the flavour or quality, but I can assure you that those prices do not justify what is being put on your plate. 


Service
The service was the worst part of the experience, and the main reason why we will not be coming back to this restaurant (and possibly the Bisha Hotel, altogether). I have mentioned our indecorous waiter with his failed jokes, but the rest of the staff also shared the unprofessional manners. A few of our guests were running a bit late, and a hostess deemed to ask if it was fine for her to take the table away when the restaurant was almost empty, and tons of other tables were available. She rushed the birthday girl into confirming if the other guests we had were still coming, which was extremely distasteful. Aside from that, numerous servers and hostesses kept reminding us that we only had the table until 9pm (we were there are 6pm). A reminder once or twice is acceptable, but to be in constant notification every few minutes was just horrific. How could we finish our food in a timely manner when everything comes more than 30 minutes late? 

All in all, we will not be coming back. There are many other places with the great view, but have way better service, and a more palatable menu. Save your money and experience, especially if you are thinking of going for a special occasion, celebrating it at this restaurant would not be advisable as it might just ruin your day."}
{"text":"Amazing view with a classy vibe. This is where you want to go to get food and drinks with your girls (and take some instagram pictures if you're into that)! I can't wait to come back in the summer when the patio is open. 

As 2 people we had 3 sharing plates, and were full! We ordered the fried calamari (they add a nori sesame seasoning which is amazing), ahi tuna ceviche (only comes win 4 shells), and the avocado flatbread."}
{"text":"Kost is located on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel. The beautiful views of the CN tower and the city make the restaurant worth it alone! 

My friend and I made reservations to dine here for Sunday brunch. There was coat check available which we happily used. Service was attentive and the waiters never rushed us through our meal.

We both shared an avocado toast and an eggs Benedict with green chorizo. I also ordered a Jasmine Sloane tea. Both food items were delicious. The green chorizo, pico de gallo, and toasted bolillo bun definitely gave the dish a unique twist to the traditional eggs benny. The bread on the avocado toast could have been slightly toasted a bit more but it was not difficult to cut which was great. 

Overall, good meal and gorgeous city views. Excited to come back during the summer when the weather is warmer with the patio open!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Kost. Food was below average, service was great and the views were incredible. Expect a fun crowd and take plenty of pictures on the roof. It's best to grab a reservation."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it was a good time. The food was delicious (the coffee was not). Recommendations off the brunch menu include he rancheros bowl and the pancakes for sure! Definitely pricey but I'd say it's worth it. Service is quite slow but the food is delicious and the view is definitely one that doesn't do justice in photos. I would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday with 4 of my friends on a Sunday for brunch. We didn't have a reservation and had drinks at the bar while waiting for an hour for a table. We got seated right in the corner with the best view of the CN tower! Service was great and we we're never forgotten. Had much selection on their menu, which my vegetarian friend was also grateful for. Everyone was satisfied with their meals and portion. One thing we didn't expect was for a mimosa to cost just as much as the food, both around $16. 

Overall, had 0 complaints, everything was amazing! Great for photos and is very aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Amazing view and even better food! Service was great as well! The calamari was incredible, the roast chicken even more mouth watering! Can't go wrong with a place like this no matter the occasion."}
