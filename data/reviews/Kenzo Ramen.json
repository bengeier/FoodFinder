{"text":"I'm from Vancouver and have tasted all the ramen shops from Kintaro to Sanpachi.  Vancouver provides a wide array of ramen shops within a 1 mile radius within the downtown area.  While on a business trip in Toronto, I went in Kenzo for a late night bite and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the soup was steaming hot and had lots of death.  It was every bit as good as the Vancouver ramen shops.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Ahh where to begin.. I remember when Kenzo first opened (2009) and I've been a regular there since.  Try starting out with Tonkotsu ramen. It's pork bone based and I think it has the perfect taste for both new to ramen and ramen lovers.  If you love spicy food, you can't go wrong with King of Kings ramen. It's pretty filling and you can get up to 3 levels of spiciness. (One time, I asked for level 10)  If you're looking for smaller ramen, I usually get either Shio (salt based) or Shoyu (soy sauce based) ramen. Don't let their lower price and smaller size fool you. More and more I tried these simplified ramens, I found myself ordering Shio and Shoyu more!  If you're going to Dundas location, be aware that it gets crowded quick and you'll probably have to wait."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday with a co-worker. The place was so packed that we waited in line (it was -8 outside) for about 15 min. What to say? My expectations were high after the line-up, and Kenzo did NOT deliver.   We had the Shoyu and Tonkatsu Ramen. The Shoyu was much too salty, I felt like I had consumed 3 days worth of sodium in that one meal. Toppings were sparse. There was barely a handful of noodles in the bowl.   Service was cold, although there were only 2 waitresses for a packed room of hungry people. So not much room for complaints there."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best ramen I've had in Toronto - I like Sansotei (on Dundas) better.  However, they have a lot more options to choose from, so if you want a variety of ramen, come here.  I prefer Tonkotsu or pork bone broth based soup, and I thought Sansotei or Santouka does a better job with the soup base.  The noodles itself were good but the meat was average -- it could have been more flavorful.  One of the must get items here is the fried gyozas.  They were much larger than expected and were very flavorful.  Didn't really enjoy the octobus balls.  Service was mediocre since my gyozas and octopus didn't come out until after my friend and I finished our ramen.  Had we not asked them about it, I think they would have forgotten about them!"}
{"text":"Kenzo is my current go-to spot for ramen in Mississauga!  The location is in the Burnhamthorpe plaza with Chatime and Sugar Marmalade, great for pairing with either if you want something sweet after your ramen! The restaurant itself has one of my favourite decors, all wood everything with cute decor!  I have so far tried the shi-o ramen and it was great :) It was my first time at Kenzo so I wanted to try something light, and it was definitely that but also had enough flavour. My favourite part was the roasted pork which was extremely tasty! The noodles were also very good, I believe that they are made fresh. My friend and I shared the takoyaki and it was slightly disappointing, as a big takoyaki fan I did not think that they were worth the price because to me they were quite squishy/soggy and there was too much sauce.  Overall, I would recommend Kenzo wholeheartedly for the amazing atmosphere/decor and ramen! I am looking forward to coming back and will probably try the tonkotsu ramen."}
{"text":"#detox ...... will not go again  Takoyaki tasted nice..  but something is wrong with the pork in ramen.."}
{"text":"Really bad experiences gained today about the horrible services. It was my friend's birthday. The waiter told us there is no table for 8 ppl after we have waited outside for 15-20 mins. It's ok if there has no big table for big group, but waiter should tell us in the beginning instead of told us to wait. Wtf??? Really upset, never visit again."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try Kinton this weekend, and went to Kenzo down the street (okay, a long way down the street) today to compare.  Here's my finding.    Broth - Kenzo: clean, fresh and lightly. Slightly saly, but I like it that way. Kinton: very fatty, lumps of fat floating around, very strong \"pork bone\" taste. Nice flavour, but very fatty tasting. and doesn't have that clean fresh tast of Kenzo's. Much less salty than Kenzo. Broth Score: Kenzo 4, Kinton 2.5  Noodles: Kenzo's are nicely chewy and fresh tasting. Kinton's are close but taste a bit more \"packaged\". Noodles Score: Kenzo 4, Kinton 3  Egg: Both delicious but I prefer the saltiness of Kenzo's: Egg Score: Kenzo 5, Kinton 4  Chai Siu: Kenzo's is \"okay\" but tastes more like Chinese pork. The Kinton pork shoulder (and Pete's pork belly) were moist, soft and delicious, with thick cuts of meat and very generous portions.  Meat Score - Kenzo 3, Kinton 4.5  Extras: Kinton's nori accompinament is a nice touch. Kenzo's bok choi (or was it gai lan, I don't remember) and smushed ginger add a nice bit of flavour. Draw.  Overall - I favour Kenzo by a fairly wide margin, mostly on account of the broth. I just found myself very full after eating at Kinton, due no doubt to the fact that it felt like I had just eaten a cup of melted lard. Too fatty for me. But I can see it as being a matter of taste."}
{"text":"Nice place, good collection of vegetarian soups."}
{"text":"Little ramen store tucked along Dundas street.  It has limited choices on the menu to start with, and was a little disappointed to found out that some items on the menu were no longer available. Perhaps it's their plan to specialize on popular items on the menu. Don't like it when they have put stickers on top of items they no longer make, instead of having a new menu.  My friend and I both ordered Tonkotsu ramen during lunch time, the food came fairly quickly. The pork bone broth (vegetarian alert!) was rich with flavour and the ramen has a nice texture to it. LOVE the shoyu marinated soft boiled egg, though there was only half an egg in each ramen bowl. There were only a few thin slices of pork belly as well. Inhaled within minutes, still left me feeling.. unfulfilled. I guess you get what you pay for $9.95  It's the place to go to if you want something fast and quick to eat in the cold winter downtown Toronto. It's pretty decent, and I have had a lot worse ramen in the past. Not easy being a ramen chef nowadays ne!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were shopping along Queen Street and had stopped into Kenzo Ramen for lunch. The interior was simple and spotless. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We had both ordered the Tan Tan Ramen, with two orders of Tonkatsu, a large sake, and a ginger ale (yes, we have quite an appetite). The food was delicious and we were definitely satisfied with everything. The prices were very reasonable compared to other establishments and I would certainly visit Kenzo Ramen again when in the area."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for vacation and am always on the look-out for a ramen specific restaurant in any new town I'm in.  I really liked the tonkotsu ramen.  It's the only ramen I tried, but liked it so much that I came back for dinner another night.  The broth was rich and flavorful and the pork was very tasty!!  The noodles was not great, but not bad.  The location is very convenient to where we were staying downtown and easily accessible by the TTC subway.  The service was quick but not the friendliest, but I'm okay with that.  All-in-all, I would recommend."}
{"text":"the food took awhile to arrive cause the service was kinda slow but i didn't mind too much since they were low on staff and also cause i had such a wonderful ramen experience!  the noodles were crunchy and the broth was very quenching. i just really wish they had a larger variety of ramen to choose from cause i think they only had about 10 different kinds of ramen. i ordered the tonkotsu ramen and thought it tasted great and was really addicted to the broth. my older sister ordered the miso ramen and said there was alot of flavour to it  and my younger sister ordered the yakisoba which was okay but a little on the salty side. as our appetizer we ordered gyozas which were amazng! very meaty and crispy which is the way i like it. overall i thought it was good and a great place to have lunch."}
{"text":"The kenzo at this location is pretty bad, music is so loud and tasteless. And Ramon noodles are very normal, nothing special... the good thing is that there is never line up there."}
{"text":"I love Ramen, but this place wasn't anything particularly special. The price is right, the place is clean and the servers were nice. When it comes right down to the food though, I wouldn't recommend it any more readily than other options for a good soup in the area."}
{"text":"Okay place to have ramen if you have sudden craving and it's in the area. Their broth lacks depth of flavours. Customer service is usually fine but the place gets busy very fast during lunch hour. I used to go 10 minutes earlier to avoid the crowd. For some reason they don't see single customer as valuable, which I find quite annoying."}
{"text":"I went in with my fiancee and I was expecting the same level of quality as to let's say...Sansotei Ramen. About the same price or so, the Ramen was OK at best. For such a wide bowl, there's less food. In my mind, I thought (okay, it's not about quantity, it's a about quality). Unfortunately, the overall quality of the soup let me down. The broth is probably the best part but as an overall dish, it was OK.   I'm giving it 3 Stars since there's always room for improvement. For now, I'm gonna have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The ramen here is amazing! I got the tonkutsu ramen and the broth/soup was soooo good. My mom got the spicy 1 ramen. Which was actually spicy considering that I can handle most spicy things. It was really good! The waiters there greet you when you come in and say goodbye to you when you leave. And are super friendly. If you come here in the weekend there are a LOT of people. So I ended up going on work hours. I gave 4 stars because they should add not tables considering how popular it is. But overall amazing restaurant and definitely a must on your to-do list."}
{"text":"Best  cure for our Toronto winter.  First time a friend suggested going for Ramen I balked. Why bother when i can get my ramen fix from instant ramen? Then I tried it on a cold winter night with a friend and became a convert.  Its nothing like the MSG filled Mr noodle that was my staple in undergrad years. Their broth is to die for and the ramen noodles.. le sigh. Totally worth the wait for tables.  Will return again and again for the Sapporo style NetSu- Ramen."}
{"text":"I was there last weekend and I had the Tonkotsu Ramen.  The first thing I did was tasted the broth, had a bite of the pork and then slurped the noodles.  The broth was very flavourful with a rich creamy texture and the pork was seasoned well.  Service was good as I was greeted by a hostess right when I walked in.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Another fake ramen place operated by Korean. I ordered the miso pork bone soup. Very disappointed with the soup because I could only taste the saltiness of from the miso. PuttIng bean sprouts into the ramen is just gross. come on! This is not Viet pho. $10.95 for a ramen like this is definitely a no no. Never gonna go back."}
{"text":"Amazing spicy char sui ramen. This broth is the most flavourful of their ramens, and is highly addictive. I come here all the time, and their food is delicious and consistent. Hint-you can ask for nonspicy or 0.5 spicy for this ramen. Also, the Tsukemen is awesome too"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen in Mississauga.  Service is fast and the selection is great.  It is very small and busy though so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Kenzo for a little over a year. Things have been slowly sliding down hill: lukewarm broth, no spice, declining presentation, crowding more tables into the dining room. And then staff f-bombed another customer when he had a complaint and asked for the manager? Errrrrrrr....No. Goodbye!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's straight forward and to the point Ramen. We arrived right before the lunch rush, so we were able to get a seat right away. The ramen choices are more than some of the other places that I've been to, which is nice. The staff was courteous but I wouldn't describe them as friendly. The environment was clean and well kept. I had their new really spicy ramen which I forgot the name. When I ordered, the waitress warned me that a level 1 spice was the same as a level 3 spicy for their regular ramen. I decided to give the level 1 a try and holy crap! She was not lying!! That ramen was spicy!! I think I prefer the king of kings ramen with level 3 spiciness.halfway through the meal we added park katsu which is supposed to be an appetizer. They were lightening fast in getting it for us, so as to be able to continue eating or lunch with all of our food served at the same time.  My lunch partner had their stir fried noodles...I believe yakisoba, which was also delicious and served on a hot plate which helped to keep its temperature throughout the meal. I think they should have a sign that states that you have to stand up and walk to the counter to pay, otherwise you end up sitting and waiting around for someone to bring over a credit card machine. Other than that, pretty great lunch time spot."}
{"text":"Five star. King of kings, very good. So good, probably the best!  Other ramen places is FAKE ramen.    Can confirm"}
{"text":"The noodles are cooked well - it's the only redeeming factor. The broth is supremely disappointing. Unbalanced, just a weird mix mash of flavour. The bland heap of bean sprouts/mix veg they add seem like filler and do not add anything to the bowl.   If you're craving ramen, take the drive up to the city. This place, unfortunately, does not compare to Kinton, Santouka or even the Kenzo on dundas. You'll leave here feeling wishing you made the trip, because you would have had something more delicious in your belly."}
{"text":"Well this is the only decent Ramen place in the suburbia. Hence the there was a considerable wait (~20 min) before we were seated. Since it is a chain restaurant it is the same menu, however the atmosphere here was hustling bustling with subtle izakayaish vibe. I personally a big fan of such vibe. Tonkatsu was good, but not again this is not an Ippido broth. Must visit, if you are in Sauga."}
{"text":"Very good, love the Takoyaki. a little expensive, but good food."}
{"text":"Good ramen chain a variety of ramen. Tried the seafood ramen and the tonkotsu ramen. The seafood ramen had great seafood flavor and plenty of shellfish. The tonkotsu ramen was fine. They didn't use the thin white noodles that would be traditional for richer broths like tonkotsu. The pork was a slice of plain shoulder. The broth itself was not as rich and didn't have the collagen it should have had. Good ramen especially if you in the mood for it and many locations around Toronto."}
{"text":"Whenever I walk into Kenzo, King of Kings Ramen and Tonkotsu Ramen automatically start a mental war in my head. Which will reign supreme? Choose either one, and you will not be disappointed.  Perfectly marinated meat, richly tea-soaked eggs, flavourful broth and good service (slow seating at times), this particular Kenzo location is a winner.  Tip: sit away from the door during winter, and the tables are quite close together.  KENZOOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of ramen.  Flavourful broth and nicely cooked noodles.   I always find their meat portions over cooked and small.   takoyaki is ok... mind you, I haven't tasted any spectacular takoyaki in Toronto. period."}
{"text":"I'm a huge ramen fan and I was disappointed when I went to Kenzo yesterday.   I had the Kings of King Ramen with a spicy level 2/3. It was really spicy though I'm Chinese and can take a quite a lot of hotness. Moreover, mushrooms and meat in the soup tasted smoky, not in a good way. They tasted like they were over cooked and the fire was way too hot for them.   Overall, I don't think I will ever go back there."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty busy, but luckily a single table was available for my boyfriend and I. It's pretty small in here, but not at all cramped feeling.   We ordered the gyoza and green tea smoothie to share. I had the Ji Su Men and my boyfriend ordered The King of Kings. The gyoza was packed with flavour and each dumpling was very generously filled. I will definitely order this dish every time I come here. It's really that good! The green tea smoothie although delicious was not worth the $4.95. It came in a very small glass whereas the photo that was advertising the drink was in a glass twice the size that was actually delivered to me. I was pretty disappointed and I don't recommend ordering this drink.   I had better luck with my ramen thankfully. The Ji Su Men had a broth that was rich and thick thanks to the egg and the noodles were perfect. The portion was pretty big, in fact sharing a bowl probably would have been more than enough especially after filling up on gyoza. I had a few sips of the King of Kings. It had great flavour and wasn't overly spicy. My boyfriend definitely enjoyed it.   Overall we had a great meal and we'll be returning to eat more gyoza and to try the other ramen dishes."}
{"text":"A great \"authentic\" ramen house in Mississauga. My family and I visit this place at least once a week. Due to the value for dollar, this place can get very busy during peak hours on the weekend. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location three or four times, it wasn't until yesterday that they hit two stars. For m last few visits, this Korean owned ramen place have never been busy. Their ramen was okay, service was not too bad as well. So I always go back and willing to give them 3 stars. But everything became different when they got busy on boxing day.  The ramen were about the same quality, but as usual, don't compare them with Japanese owned places. It was the service we received got the two stars they well deserved.  The most important reason why I thought Kenzo's different was their spicy ramen, but I found out yesterday that they no longer do the most spicy ones because there were dispute about the \"finish all and have it free\" policy or something. So I ordered the less spicy one, but after sending the order to the kitchen, I was told that they don't do it either. Fine, why are the posters still all over the wall, outside of the door then? It doesn't seem to be that hard to peel them off.  Another thing, if you are setting the default percentage for tips as 13% or higher on your credit card machine, busy does not justify the change of service level. You can be fast and busy, but still polite and attentive. Learn from other ramen places, they are always busy but they always treat you very well.   We understand if there were policies about outside food because we took some bubble teas in, we would even throw it away if needed. But what we got was \" Just to confirm this is outside food right? Just take it when you leave.\" WOW.  There was only one guy seemed to care about what the customers asked, but the other girls' bad matter just dragged everybody else down. I feel very bad about the friends I dragged into Kenzo with me yesterday; we could've had better food and service at Sansotei across the street."}
{"text":"This is some of the best ramen in the city, and they serve Takoyaki to boot! I was so happy to discover there was a location in my neighbourhood in addition to the one near my work. This Kenzo is a little small and crowded, but the ramen is just as tasty as at the Bloor location."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5  This is a small place, with tables quite close together. I came here near the end of the night so it was not too bad, but I can't imagine how tight it would be during a lunch or dinner rush. The menu was small, but fine by me. I had the Netsu, and my gf had the Yakisoba. We shared gyozas (was disappointed they had sold out of Takoyaki). The noodles and toppings were very good, however, the broth was so-so (I prefer the broth at Kinton). The surprise of the night was the gyoza though. They were quite large, juicy and tasty. Service was quick.  Overall, I liked the meal and food. I would come back if I'm in the area and felt like ramen; however, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Food is exquisite, and AMAZING service. The miso ramen tasted great and I couldn't have thought of a better tasting dish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Not real Japanese food including donburi and ramen. Service is not that good. But the taste is not so bad. I will still go there for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"As glad as I am to see an actual ramen shop finally opening in Mississauga, this branch of kenzo is definitely lacking.  I've visited about 7-8 times since they have opened, and literally every time, they have failed to have takoyaki! They told me they ran out but I found out a few days ago their machine is actually broken. I would understand if it was just a few days, but it's been well over a month now?   The broth is great, and the portions are also decently consistent. I am quite unhappy with the egg though, it's always over cooked (between 90-100% hard boiled instead of 50-60%). Sometimes their pork is too chewy, maybe it's over cooked? Not exactly sure. Their garlic is always questionable, it's between a light orange to dark brown. I know that minced garlic only does that when mixed with oil which forms a LOT of bacteria if not used immediately. I don't think that quite constitutes food safe, but I guess no one complains since it's just a tiny amount.  The rest if the ramen is pretty good, so no more complaints about that.  Service is on and off. I've had really nice and attentive servers, but also have had my order forgotten, water spiller on me, soup spilled on me, waited twenty minutes for my bill, and attitude for not being ready with my food choice literally after sitting down.    I have seen them pre making the gyoza with bare hands and over a energetic chat, as well as the chefs drinking and eating where the food is prepared. Again, food safe? Still questionable.   I've been to the other kenzo locations and those are by far better in every single aspect. The only good thing about this one is that it's close to home. Hopefully they'll match up to their downtown counter parts decently soon."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying out Kenzo Japanese Noodle House since it have opened.  Let's say I was pretty satisfied  with my experience dinning in.  I was greeted by many waitresses once entered in, I just felt very welcomed at that moment (yay!)  I was seated pretty quickly and were given the menu once seated.  However, the con side is that I had to wait 15 minutes after being seated until they served some water to us (which I find considerably long).    The prices are not too expensive nor cheap.  Some noodle bowls were even less than $10, but I tried out one of their recommendations and it was plenty enough.  But as seen from other prepared dishes, some dishes were smaller portions compared to others.  So it really depends on what you pick to have!   I would one give this restaurant 3 stars just because while sitting down and waiting for the food, it was extremely humid! There was absolutely no air condition and only 1 out of the many fans in this restaurant were turned on.  Since it is an open kitchen, the heat is crazy!  Once I start indulging in my food, it got even more humid and was even sweating, just had to run for the exit after paying for the meal!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Kenzo location I've been to. The soup base for the ramen was flavourful but for sure they added a lot of msg. I kept needing to drink water right after my meal."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend twice now and both times the food was good. I can finish a whole bowl myself and be full so I think normal people would need to order extra noodles to be full (I don't eat that much.. lol) or you could order the takoyaki to fill your stomachs instead!  Only things that hold me back from giving it 4 stars are the service and the environment. service was alright, not really existent and they took a while to get us water. and umm environment wise.. this location is really small and the distance between your table and other people are realllllly close so i could hear everything the couple beside me were saying hahah (but it was ok cuz their conversation was hilarious.. i would write what they said but i'm scared one of them might somehow read this post haha)  Lastly.. i think to save money.. they bought chairs from a library"}
{"text":"Go there fairly regularly. Love their Tonkotsu Ramen, the portion size is ok, the soup base is delicious. the noodles are made just the right texture. Plus their tacoyaki is delicious - albeit pricey."}
{"text":"When it comes to ramen, I may have high expectations.   Ever since I had that amazing tonkotsu kimchi ramen on one sizzling summer day in the middle of downtown Osaka in 2001, I still cannot forget the experience of lining up for ramens in 38 degree heat for 20 mins. The ramen after the wait was so good that the tonkotsu broth, the noodle, and the spicy kimchi toppings were just perfectly balanced. It was totally worth the wait in that heat with a bunch of other customers.  I may still be living in that dream because the tonkotsu at Kenzo fell short of my expectation. Comparing to Ajisen ramen, it was a par in terms of quality and taste. However, it fell short  in terms of amount. Smaller amount but higher pricing point at $8.95. Also, I have tried tonkotsu-miso ramen ($8.95), and tsauke-men($8.95). All of them did not meet my expectation in terms of quality with respect to pricing.  Service was below my standard as well. The server forgot to put my gyoja order. But when it was found out missing, there was no apology or no excuse for whatever happened. He tired to argue that we did not order it. :(  Since I don't generally argue with a server, I've just let it go. Sub-par training and management.   Three stars for food, two stars for service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Our party of 10 Yelpers was just too much to handle for the new kitchen and staff. So Kenzo can forget about turning up in any \"Good for Groups\" searches. Despite that, I had a great time meeting everyone at my inaugural UYE; a cool bunch of reviewers and yippee!-- free SWAG! Thanks, Kat and Justin!  Kenzo is a \"Japanese Noodle House\" run by Koreans so that means that the noodles won't be terribly authentic and the service will be brusque. (Don't take it personally; this is par for the course at Korean establishments.) But at $7 for a big, filling bowl of noodles, I'm not expecting a whole lotta a$$-kissing. They want customers in and out as quickly as possible -- no lingering because they need your bowl back. Seriously, they were running short of bowls!  I had the Orochong Ramen -- a spicy bowl of noodle soup that's, according to the menu, \"popular with Japanese youth and Koreans\" (Really? OK, if you say so.) The broth had a good kick but the bell peppers and undercooked mushrooms were not so popular with this Korean.   Kenzo isn't the place for noodle purists or long, boozy dinners. A quick, cheap bite maybe. Just don't show up with more than 2 people in your party."}
{"text":"I'll start off with very friendly. I asked for a recommendation and was asked some basic questions to see what I might like and then given a recommendation of 2 items. Which is perfect. Narrow it down for me! The ramen was light and delicious. I actually finished it... which is rare. They brought me water and kept it filled without asking which is rarer than you think.  It was only my first visit but I'm impressed enough to come back should I be in the area. Maybe even worth a little trip to the area and make this a Part of it."}
{"text":"Having heard decent reviews of this place (and the fact that they make vegetarian broth), I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Miso Ramen and have to say that the flavor of the broth was more inventive than Kinton Ramen on Baldwin. The noodles were disappointing (I love a good bowl of handmade noodles); these were definitely store bought. The veggies were a bit off (black spotted celery). Overall the dish was nothing exciting.  The service was mixed. At first we were seated and taken care of by an attentive and pleasant server. He made sure to clarify ingredients for my friend who ordered Vegetarian Yakisoba. I believe he took his break half-way through our meal. Once we had finished, the other server ignored us even though she walked by several times. Finally we had to wave her over to ask for the bill.  Not worth a try, unless you want an imitation of ramen. Even then, you're better cooking a package of Ichiban at home."}
{"text":"The food is nice. Best to come earlier in weekend at night. Good customer service. A Little bit over price. I enjoy the food every much."}
{"text":"Kenzo was my first bowl of Ramen years ago when it was one of only a few places in the downtown core. I've never been into Kinton. I think their broth is over the top. Sansotei is pretty good and for a while I was a convert. But I went back to Kenzo in its first location tonight and remembered what I always loved about it. The Tonkotsu broth is classically hearty but has a lot of subtlety as well. The option of blackened garlic added to the broth is nice. King of Kings still reins supreme. Only complaint is that the sprouts tasted a bit strange.   I was there with my two month old and our big stroller. They were very happy to accommodate us and we're very friendly even though it meant we took up a table for four. It was our first meal out since the little one was born and they made it such a nice experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, would be a lot more but for whatever reason when I want to go it's always on a Sunday and they are closed. I always forget they are closed.  They have a few vegetarian options, staff is very nice and will accommodate. I always get the spicy ramen, take out the pork and get a bunch of stuff like eggs in. When I say spicy I mean spicy, it's usually a back and forth with the staff making sure I really want it that hot which is fine by me! Level 5-6 spicy. So good. While I prefer to go out of the way to other ramen places because of better vegetarian options, when I am in the mood for spicy ramen Kenzo accommodates :)"}
{"text":"I came here when it first opened and I wasn't impressed. This time around its completely different. I had the Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and the broth was flavorful and the meat was tender. The portion was decent and some of my colleagues were really full after their bowl. I like how fresh the noodles were as they make the noodles themselves. Be prepared to wait in line. I came here for lunch on a weekday around noon and the wait was about 15 min, not bad."}
{"text":"This ramen isn't good. It is super bland and the pork is dry.  Go to one of Torontos many other better ramen places for a much better meal."}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed in this place.   I got the shio (salt) noodles @ $6.95. They were ok, but nothing special. Although I wasn't expecting a flavor that could compare to anything I've had in Japan, I also wasn't expecting the flavor that was rather close to canned broth here. The King of King noodles someone else at my table ordered were fancier, but it didn't look like it should cost more than $10.   The expensive $8 for 6 tako yaki were not worth the price. The batter had was dry and had no flavor. (I prefer the cheaper ones they sell in the food court at T&T Supermarket Milliken.)  I probably won't come back here, which means I'm still looking for a half decent ramen shop in Toronto. :("}
{"text":"Service was poor, food wasn't that great. There are so many better restaurants along the street, go there instead."}
{"text":"Great, authentic ramen and atmosphere. Very flavourful and satisfying. Also excellent donburi. When they opened.  Unfortunately, over the past few months it feels as though their success has lead to a drop in quality of the food. In addition to this, one of my favourite comfort foods is no longer on the menu - donburi.  Will definitely check in from time to time as even on a bad day they're still one of the better options in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch at about 1 ish, I would have to say this is one of the worst and yet funny experience I have had for a while. The waitress there (btw only two of them) are extreme rude with a BIG attitude to all customers. We waited for about 20 mins and saw one of the customer complained about her order because it is not what she has ordered. Waitress took back the ramen to the kitchen and soon came out again and YELL (seriously yell) at the customer!!! and dumped back the ramen soup back to the customer's table and forced her to admit that is what she ordered?!!   Me and my colleagues finally got the sits and we ordered and confirmed twice with the order to make sure we will not have such a bad experience like the above. The first ramen came out very quickly and we attempted to inform the waitress that the ramen soup is not what we ordered! (The toppings are not the same as the ones we pointed on the menu). The lady waitress gave us a total mad face and choked her shoulders said that she has no control and do not know why the ramen does not look like the menu ramen pictures. It is up to her previous boss who makes up the menu and decide not to follow the toppings on the ramen soups? Not to waste anymore of our lunch time, we accepted the order as the previous customer did. We were basically forced to eat the toppings that are not what we've ordered.   Food wise is not that bad but the portion could be better. But I was so thirsty after I get back to the office and we are not planning to refer ANY of our colleagues to this downtown Kenzo Ramen!   Only go there if you are in a good mood, otherwise you will get yell at for sure. Waste your money somewhere else with at least an acceptable customer service."}
{"text":"Came here just because we felt like to have ramen noodles for the day. Since it was out first-time here, we didn't know there was a wait list you need to put your name on it just to get in the line. And instead I was dumb enough to wait in the queue outside the restaurant waiting to be served.   We had the Takoyaki for the start-up, each ball did look great but we were kinda upset as they only got a tiny portion of octopus inside.   We ordered two ramen noodles dishes: 1. King of Kings & 2. Karashi (not spicy). These two dishes were all delicious, I had the King of Kings and each slice of the roasted pork was just perfect enough to the point that you might feel like to have more of these slices in your bowl. The sliced eggs and fish cakes were also a plus. However, I didn't know what condiments they put in the soup, the more  the soup you have, the more water you'd drink. The soup base would just made you thirsty.   My girl had the Karashi (not spicy), I personally think its soup tastes much better than the one I had. Anyway, they are both good ramen noodles dishes."}
{"text":"This place was not bad. Service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the ramen is decent enough. It's good for a quick bite but don't expect to be blown away by the food here."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen. Would go again. There's a bit of a wait and there's no reservations but the line goes quickly and food worth it. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Quick in and out service. The king of kings Ramen was delicious. Great meal for cold November day."}
{"text":"It is opened by Chinese people so technically it is Chinese way of Ramen...so, having a semi-cooked noodle is not a surprise...I left half of the bowl there...and those 2 stars are for the dumpling, which is fully cooked....if I have to give its ramen a star, I would give a -2! Go there for dumpling or DanDan noodle if you are really out of options, but not Ramen..."}
{"text":"I don't think Toronto has much choice when it comes to Ramen. I am not sure why it is so damn hard to get this right ... but at the very least, Kenzo is on the right track. I find its broth the most authentic of the lot and the preparation is commendable. The ramen itself is fairly meh:   a) Ji Su Men: I like how they sautéed the chicken and roasted the sesame seeds. The broth was well balanced too.   b) King of Kings: Just the right amount of spiciness and the combination of ingredients was perfect.   c) Okonomiyaki: This had seafood in it and was tasty mainly due to the sauce. I would have preferred it a little crispier (aka like Okonomi House).  d) Takoyaki: Blech. Too mushy and floury. I prefer Manpuku (Just the right amount of flour / ingredients) and even Guu (Guu has a crispier crust).  P/S: I will upload the Takoyaki pic another time. I can't find it but I KNOW I have it.  As for service, um ... not very good ... especially for a Japanese place. I don't know about you but all the Japanese restaurants always greet me hello and goodbye. Here, I got zilch. They were not very friendly and took ages with the bill."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch after my first marathon.    I do not have extensive ramen experience (this was probably my third bowl of ramen), but I absolutely enjoyed it.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and the soup was very flavorful, and not too salty.    Service was prompt and the portions huge. It was pretty clear that the tables next to us also fully enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get authentic ramen in Mississauga ! The restaurant is small and crowded but it's alright. The food is prepared relatively quickly and the service is great! No complaints :)"}
{"text":"I'm so excited Kenzo opened their Queen Street location! I love that they do takeout. (If you've read some of my other reviews, I like to take my food to go :P)  I was there today and ordered my usual King of Kings level 2, to go, of course. I was in and out of there in under 10 minutes.   The decor was nice, much nicer than that Bay/Dundas location, obviously, because it's brand new, and the tables were more spread out.   Had my noodles an hour later and after heating it up, it was still as delicious as I'd remembered it!"}
{"text":"Sauga ramen can't compare to downtown, but this place does a decent job, especially the black tonkatsu ramen, damn delish. I ask for black garlic sauce in every ramen, just make sure you don't have an important date or meeting after as you may have some dragon breath. Love all the Ramens on the menu except the jisu ramen."}
{"text":"I always think it's a good sign when a restaurant is crowded and if it's an ethnic restaurant, crowded with people from that nationality.  We waited about ten minutes and sat and ordered as quickly as possible.  I ordered a chicken ramen noodle dish and a hot ramen noodle dish.  The noodle bowls came out fairly quickly.  The bowls were very large and steaming hot.  Both were delicious.  The noodles in both dishes were perfectly cooked, firm but not too firm.  The broth in the chicken ramen was delicious, nourishing and there was definitely miso in it.  It had egg, mushrooms, ground up chicken, and lots of bean sprouts in it.   I would have preferred more noodles to bean sprouts but overall it was very good.  The hot ramen dish was so, so good.  It had the same type of noodles and mix of vegetables but also had some ground beef in it.  The broth was so good, red and spicy. I just slurped it up.  My favorite was the spicy noodle dish and my husband loved the chicken ramen. Overall a great experience but the one not so great thing about Kenzo Ramen is the pretty bad service.  No one was unfriendly but I literally had to ask three times for a glass of water and they finally brought me some at the end of our meal.  I understood that they were busy but still."}
{"text":"This was my very first time having miso soup. So I did a little research, the reviews on this place weren't bad so I gave it a shot. Turns out they weren't lying, it was amazing. It's a tiny little place but they turn over tables pretty quickly so if you see a line up, just chill.  I originally wanted to go downtown and check out the ones on Queen, but I wanted to see what the local Ramen house was like and I was not disappointed.  -Tasting the world, one bite at a time!"}
{"text":"Because there is no half point, I gave five points. It worths 4.5 points. I like their ramen variations. I had Tonkotsu ramen and it was good. The soup base was port bone and it was yummy. One of my group had Yakisoba and it seemed really delicious. It's impressive to have a good Japanese ramen in the heart of Toronto and the price is also reasonable. It is recommended, definitely."}
{"text":"Ramen is not the easiest food to eat for some. You should be comfortable with using chop sticks in order to fully enjoy it. That being said, the food is great. Try the 3 kings."}
{"text":"Ramen is hitting this city like a nuclear explosion (too soon?)  I haven't tried many of the new ramen joints so I can't compare, but for a reasonably priced and (up until now) unique soup in the core I recommend either of Kenzo's locations.  The menu is small and simple. You'll be getting ramen noodles in soup with a variety of extra, some spicy, some savoury. If you order a non-spicy dish they'll happily bring you their chili powder to bring it up to taste.  Again, I'm no expert, but I happen to think their tacoyaki is top notch. Love it.  Great in the winter when you're looking to warm up or if you want to clear your sinuses....or really just anytime because it's delicious."}
{"text":"Below is my rating definition.  * = Don't even bother going ** = Nothing out of the ordinary *** = Pretty good stuff **** = Outstanding ***** = It's basically 4 stars but they do it consistently  After some pretty awesome ramen experience in NYC and Vancouver, I want to find some ramen places in TO as well. Knowing that Asian cuisine is not really Toronto's forte, my standard before going in is quite low already.    THE GOOD: - Love the amount of corn, seaweed and other condiments that they throw in there...quite generous and offer a good contrast.   THE BAD: - Very expensive for the quality and quantity.   THE UGLY: - Noodle is overcooked and has no texture.  - The quality of the soup is a joke. I would put it on the same level as instant noodle with pure salt, MSG and has absolutely no depth.   PS: the ramen at Kenzo is quite Korean influenced, so if you're searching for the Japanese taste, this is probably not the place for you.    Overall, the ramen is a joke and you would be better off spending your money elsewhere instead."}
{"text":"I've been to the Kenzo on Dundas before, it was a Plan B after finding out there was a 3hr wait at Guu, and this was my first visit to the new expansion site in the Annex. Hands down I enjoyed my experience at the Bloor St better than Dundas St. I think it's mainly the décor which is much more modern with bright lighting and clean white tables. I wasn't too fond of the wood work at the Dundas location, it looked old and grungy.  Downside to the Bloor St location is the size of the restaurant, Dundas is still bigger.   The Gyoza and Takoyaki appetizers are great (I actually think the Takoyaki is better than Guu) and the Gyoza is a must. The ramen is tasty as usual and fairly decent for Toronto.   The service is quick and they're banking on fast turnover given the size of the restaurant. Upon my arrival they were reluctant to seat us until our whole party was present. So no BS, just quick, cheap, and good eats."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I had in Toronto. The gyoza was amazing."}
{"text":"I've gone to the other location on Yonge St and was always a fan so when they opened a store in Mississauga, I was very happy. It has pretty big portions and to me, it was consistent with the one on Yonge St. Service can be a bit slow during peak hours but that is understandable.  I've had multiple dishes from this restaurant and was never disappointed. The only thing is I wish they were opened on Sundays and opened a bit later on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to rehash a lot of points from previous yelpers, but the key shortcoming of this place is *SERVICE*.  Honestly, I'm not expecting a meet & greet, roll out the red carpet kind of treatment.  And I'm Asian, so I'm down with the whole - in&out streetside noodle eateries.    What strikes me as odd and disconcerting, is that Kenzo tries to be neither a restaurant with service, nor a fast noodle house.  Let me paint you a picture - I'm at work, hankering for some hot noodles for my lunch break, but I have a meeting after lunch.  I figure I'd get some take-out because it *should* be faster and I can prep for the meeting while eating.  Upon arrival, the place was full.  Not a seat left.  Given this fact, I'd expect the waitresses to be bustling around with piping hot bowls of noodles.  Sorry, but they were at the cash, idling, and most tables were empty of bowls.  So we (coworker and I) go in and make an order.  We asked where we should wait, and they couldn't tell us, just asked us to get out of the way.  So being good people, we waited at the door.  At this point, we waited a good 30 minutes for our food to be ready.  I even noticed the order - they brought out the food in the same order as when they were put in.  You would think a take-out order takes priority, since you can get them out of there faster and free up space for other patrons.    Multiple times, the waitress also came back and asked if we were waiting for a table.  No, we weren't.  We were waiting for take-out.  I'll grant you that they are not a \"take-out\" specialist, nor do they claim to be \"fast\" eats.  But in just observing - even those who were seated were served VERY slowly.    Now I'm not stranger to noodle soups - and I KNOW they aren't making soup by the order: noodle shops make huge vats of soup base early in the morning and keep it heated so that, come lunch time, they have a large vat ready for service.  All they had to do was add noodles, some meats and ingredients, and toss in some soup base and anything extra to make the soup unique, and away it goes.  This is how noodle shops thrive - fast in & out service.  This is not how Kenzo operates.  In fact, waiting for take-out, roughly half the front-room patrons finished and left before we got our order.  Taking the meal back, I now had roughly 15 minutes to vacuum up this meal.  Upon opening the bag, we realized two things.  1) We had ordered different meals, but the two soups not only tasted the same, but looked the same and smelled the same.  No, they were not labeled.  2) There was an unfair distribution of noodles.  One serving had more, one had less.  Both were less than if we had eaten in the restaurant.  3) I ordered their spicy soup ramen (don't even remember the name).  I was unable to finish in time for my meeting (had to eat it later).  However, what I did taste, was simply unbalanced - the spicy was too overpowering, and I was unable to experience any of the meat or flavours that should have been in the soup.  All I could smell and taste was an overpowering spicy.    Overall this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Best Gyozas I have ever had.  Their pork broth is delicious, and their meat cuts superb. One of my top Ramen restaurants.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst kenzo location. Very hard to communicate with the staff.  I work across the street so i eat here based on convenience.   They often forget items in my order and last time I ordered the netsu they forgot the pork.   They said they would give me a store credit for free bowl of noodles under my name but when I called back it was so difficult to communicate again and they could not find any record of my store credit.  Extremely frustrating."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen on Yonge is a great spot. I've been to this location, along with the Sheppard location and the Dundas location and this one is my favourite.   I made reservations for 10 via e-mail and then phone communication. Some restaurants don't do very well keeping on top of their email account but I always got responses within 24 hours when trying to see which of their locations would be best to cater to my group.   The prices are great. $8-14 was the entire price range for ramen I think which is really good.   We had 8 show up, and everyone was satisfied with their ramen. A few of the guys ordered Sapporo, which came with complimentary wasabi peas. The menu has a good variety to choose from. One guy got the Yakisoba (stir fried  noodles with chicken vegetables on an iron plate) and said it was done perfectly. I thought it was neat that it came on this skillet/tray sort of thing. I had the King of Kings Ramen ($12.95?), and as usual was satisfied (and full) by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl.    Will be back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was feeling in the mood for ramen today and came over here to try it out. I reviewed their website and was excited for the takoyaki balls and the tonkotsu miso ramen. When I got here I was so disappointed to find out they ran out of takoyaki and gyoza (their only other appetizer)! They also stopped selling the tonkotsu miso ramen along with a few other ramen. I was quite saddened since this wasn't changed on their website.  I came here on a Saturday and the service was slow but that's because there was only one waitress doing everything. The food came out quite quickly.  I ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen, and I was surprised. The broth was AMAZING! The pork was alright and the noodles are a bit too hard for my taste.   I'd give this place 2 stars but the broth is what saved them. However, I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here with a group. Not cheap, but not expensive either (for their ramen - their sides are another story).  Yakisoba - $11. Very tasty. Topped with bonito flakes. Served sizzling and delicious. Seems to be their only soupless noodle option. 5/5.  Gyoza - $9. 6 pieces. Expensive, but each piece was large. Still not worth it, but it was pretty tasty. It's pretty hard to screw up a dumpling IMO, so it being tasty is nothing special. 2/5.  Takoyaki - $9. 6 pieces. Expensive and not good at all. Every other place I've had takoyaki served 6 pieces for under $5 (before taxes) and was the highlight of the meal. Here, it tasted like deep fried banana batter with small pieces of squid in the middle. Not a fan, especially at that price. 0/5.  I wouldn't go out of the way to visit this place, but if you find yourself there, get the noodles, and nothing else. The company I was with ordered other noodle dishes and everyone liked that. The sides were generally disappointing. If you must get a side, avoid the takoyaki."}
{"text":"Went to Kenzo ramen place on Queen St. W. Had one of their spicy ramen, Netsu ramen. It was excellent! The noodle was very chewy, and not soggy or mushy. I really hate soggy noodles... The soup wasn't greasy and the side menus were very good as well. The price was very reasonable and the service was prompt. I heartily recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here since it opened, I avoided it before as I heard bad things about it from chef friends. Finally decided to try it out with two of my friends and find it quite alright. Got the tonkotsu ramen, and the noodles were good but soup really wasn't that flavorful. The pork belly was delicious though, and made up for the shortcomings of the soup stock.  I tried out my friend's king of king ramen, and find it on the first level of spiciness it was really bland. The amount of bean sprout just got tiresome to chew after a while.  I'll probably come back to try out their shoyu ramen, which looks quite good."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen , can be substituted to vegetarian or chicken based broth if you don't eat pork. Portion was huge . Staff was good and the food came quickly"}
{"text":"Like others said, good ramen, just an ok service. I had the King of the king? ramen and it was very tasty. The waitors and waitresses weren't that friendly but not particularly that rude either. (I've experienced worse at some pho places)  This is what happened to my friend one time. The waitor asked the customers to pay their bills in advance when they weren't even done eating because his shift was over and he had to leave. We found that VERY STRANGE. They definitely need to improve their customer service."}
{"text":"I freaking love Ramen. Authentic Ramen. But since I am no longer flying to Japan every weekend, I'm a beggar and not a chooser now, am I? And what are ramen beggars left with? Kenzo.  This new location used to be the home of Bowl, a pan Asian restaurant (and shall I mention I served there for a while? ha). The new owners did not change much in terms of layout/design. The location gets + points because it is simply much more spacious than the Dundas location, but - points because it feels a little less like a Ramen House and even less authentic (wow didn't know that was possible).  Food is alright; the menu is identical to the Dundas one. I could go on and on about how ramen in Toronto is just not good enough and too expensive (I am SUCH a ramen snob, even bigger than I am a sushi snob)... but seriously when my choices are as slim as Kenzo or Ajisen, I still regularly - albeit half-assedly - satisfy my cravings at Kenzo. Now I just have a location that is even closer to my home!  In terms of side dishes, they are really average. I would recommend to just stick to the noodles, and don't try their \"fancy\" green tea drinks either. My personal favourites are always Miso, and Tonkotsu. But guys, you really gotta go to Japan.  Atmosphere - 2/5 Service - 3/5 Food - 3/5 Price - 3/5"}
{"text":"Flavour: 3/5 Service : 4/5 Value: 3/5  Been here twice.  Ordered the tonkotsu ramen black and the king ramen.  Noodles are fresh, good and aldente. Could have a little more 'bounce' but no complaints.  The pork slices in the ramen were at times overcooked, other times they were tender and delicious.  Soup was good, but not amazing.  Would repeat for convenience."}
{"text":"The first best thing about this little soupenanny is the menu. Not cause it necessarily makes sense (choose from unspecified mystery meat #1, unspecified mystery meat #2... and does this soup have meat or not, cause I can't tell from the picture?!), but cause of its entertainment value. \"What's the difference between 'nice' noodles and 'neat' noodles?\" inquired my friend. Why is that soup 'most popular with Japanese youth'? (Some words replaced in lieu of bad memory). Applause for wonderful adjectives - \"magnificent\" chicken? Yes please!  The menu divides soups into three categories: regular soup (I don't remember what they really called it), hot soup and fancy soup (I have replaced the actual word with 'fancy'). My \"magnificent chicken\" soup was thickened with starch, and although I found the broth a little bland (where's the hot sauce in this joint?), the noodles were tasteh. Is it true they're hand-pulled?? My homegirl got the hot soup and I liked that broth much better.  I've heard good things about the Kenzo in North York, but my one meal here was hovering around pedestrian-satisfactory. I'll give it another go sometime, but wouldn't make a special trip, nosir."}
{"text":"Great ramen!  Crowded and busy but worth the wait if you love soup and home made noodles!"}
{"text":"Soup ramen dishes are awesome, I wish the other items (appetizers etc..) were as good."}
{"text":"Kenzo is a Ramen chain store in Toronto. I think it is good if you crave ramen but do not want to wait. I never had to wait for a seat at Kenzo and the food comes pretty quickly (under 10mins every time). It is a good fast food. As far as authenticity goes, it is not that authentic, it has some chinese food elements in it.  The broth is ok, it is definitely less flavorful than Santouka or Sansotei, but Kenzo is also much cheaper, gives you more food, and you have no wait. It is also close to my home, so during cold winter nights it rakes points for convenience. The servers are always friendly and polite and service is prompt. It is clean. The noodles are the wheat types and are decent, most times it is not overcooked.  Overall a good place for a decent, quick and cheap meal, but do not expect mind blowingly great ramen here."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick bite to eat! I always get the shi-yo ramen here and it is yummy!! The pork can be quite tuff sometimes since it is so lean, but the broth and noodle  are always awesome! I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad.   Unfortunately the service is just not there.   Rushed out of dinner and wouldn't even take dessert order when there are still other to let there.   Not to mention I told the waiter when I started. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"It's alright...nice and clean, small and bright.  Service is good but I can't say that the ramen was the best I've ever had.  Noodles were soft and fresh, soup salty (like all ramen houses) and the gyoza pricey.     Was hoping for chicken karage bit the app menu was pretty simple just fried tofu, gyoza, and takoyaki.   It was good.  Just good."}
{"text":"Few of my friends wanted to try this place, so gave it a shot on a Saturday afternoon.  The staff is very friendly and kind... found eating space for group of 11 very easily. Service was great.. we had a cute asian boy serving our table! lol  Most of us ordered the Pork Bone Ramon and it was simply delicious and full of flavour... good til the last drop!... Price is very reasonable for the quality and portion size you get. Def two thumbs up and do give it a shot."}
{"text":"i saw this place getting some poor reviews here, so much so we almost didn't check it out...but we are glad that we did. the service was really quite friendly and attentive. the soups were rich and well prepared. truly no one else downtown is making complex hearty feel good soups like this. as with any review, sooner or later if you are intrigued enough by a restaurant you should just go and do it."}
{"text":"It was my first ramen experience and I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure why people expect excellent service at places like this (ramen, pho, etc) and complain if they don't get it. The service isn't as great as a fine dining restaurant, but they aren't rude and they bring you the food. The tables a bit cramped but the food gets there quick and is tasty."}
{"text":"For the most part, this place is good. However, I have only tried 3 different types of ramen from this place: the orochong? Karashi, and Kings of King. I love spicy noodles, so I usually get these. I had the shoyu once, but it was kind of plain. The karashi is the best, and i usually get level 2 (level 3 when i crave it). My only problem is that the meat they give is too little (2 small pieces of meat thinly sliced), and a lot of veggies but too little noodles. I guess the delicious broth makes up for it. Noodles are chewy, which I love!"}
{"text":"Finally went and tried this new joint (which had swiftly replaced its predecessor, Red Charcoal), and hm... as much as I wanted to love it, it didn't quite bring the delicious-ness I so craved.  A few notes: - The green tea I ordered came with it's own tea bag, which is good, but the cup was only filled halfway. Was this someone's old cup?  - I ordered what I thought was thicker ramen noodles, but it appears the description meant that the soup was thicker. Also strange. - Judging by the amount of stuff topping my ramen noodles, I'd expect there to be much more flavour. It was good, but again, should be better.   Also, a little on the pricey side if you ask me. $11 for a bowl of noodles? A jaunt over to the much more authentic Manpuku down the street, or a bowl of Chinatown noodles, does the job much better, for cheaper."}
{"text":"I like Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and the king of the kings  ramen, the soup of Tonkotsu is better than the king of kings, but king of kings is like a value pack, you have everything in it and the quantity is big."}
{"text":"I ordered a large sake but they ran out of large sake pitchers, so they gave me a small and a free refill. My refill wasnt as much as my initial pitcher so i complained but the guy showed me that he poured a large into the small and that my refill was the leftovers, so i was actually poured the right amount. He gave me another refill for free anyways.  The ramen was also pretty good."}
{"text":"When I first got there I had to write my name on a clip board outside and waited to be seated I waited about 10 minutes but honestly after having the food i wouldn't have minded having to wait a lot longer. Portion sizes are quite big and prices are more than fair.  The people that work there are pretty adorable they all say bye when you leave, like synced.   Would highly recommend giving this place a try !!!!"}
{"text":"Place was great. We came back a second time and the service and food was also at its best"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite ramen place! First time I tried Kenzo was on their Toronto branch and I was so thrilled when I found out they opened one here in Mississauga. Aside from the ramen, we always order the yakisoba and the gyoza."}
{"text":"Perfect for COLD WINTER NIGHTS. Or if you're like me, ANYTIME you have a soup/ramen serving. Highly recommended the Netsu Ramen, Tan tan men, d YUMMY Karaage chicken, marinated pork with rice bowl, Takoyaki (baked octopus balls, hey wipe that silly  grin off yer face,Lol)- and I'm sure when I come back,all the other ramen soups would be equally YUMMY :)"}
{"text":"Very fun going to this place! Open kitchen, very entertaining to look over the kitchen to see how my food is made! They greet us loudly and say good bye to everyone that leaves! The kitchen staff with a tattoo gave me a smile woohoo! Highly recommend this noodle shop very very delicious!"}
{"text":"My all-time fave is the King of Kings, which is packed with a lot of goodies.  Broth is great, with just enough spice that warms the tummy.   If I were to base my rating just on this dish, I would have given 4 stars.  But having had some of their other ramen, I find some of the others oddly lacking in ingredients (but just as tasty). Considering King of Kings is jam-packed with stuff, I found it funny that some are served so plain.  One thing that is unfortunate is the place is very small.  It gets quite busy in the evenings so be ready to wait for a table.  There's probably one or two servers at any given time, so service may be quite slow."}
{"text":"Four stars for now because it's only the second Japanese ramen shop that I have encountered that makes everything fresh. Can't give it a five star until I know it's the best. I can say that the ramen is delicious. Nothing beats freshly hand tossed noodles. I've gone to places that literally give you instant ramen noodles and try to add things to spice it up. I've had big shi-yu ramen and king of kings ramen and both are delicious. Every element goes well together and has great flavor. The flavor of the meats are also good. The service to me is also great. My standards are if they refill my water when it's empty, I get my food without a long wait I'll have no complaints. Pouring water is my standard because it shows they are paying attention. Parking here can be hard since there are many other business around but not impossible."}
{"text":"5 stars for service 3 for ramen  I came here with 4 friends at 10 pm and the kitchen has closed for the night, but they were able to open it up for 5 bowls of ramen. Yes! Excellent service.  Charm and Aaron were amazing servers and didn't rush us even when we were holding them from leaving work.  It's not the best ramen I've ever eaten but it does it job at 10 bucks a bowl and it's only 50 cents to add an extra egg."}
{"text":"I went back to Kenzo - only because my friend had planned a group outing.  Hey, maybe they smoothed out the lumps from their recent opening. (Nope.)  I was actually nervous about returning as a group, based on the awful service previously, when I attended as part of a Yelp event.  Fortunately, this time, it was for only four people, and we took a booth.  The service was only marginally better than the first time around.  While the service wasn't blatantly rude, it wasn't particularly polite, either.  What befuddled me was the waitress handing us a small flyer with various food items - that we *weren't allowed to order*.  It was just some \"informational\" thing educating us about other types of Japanese food.  Note to Kenzo management: DON'T hand out anything except menus with food we can actually order.    It also took a while to flag down the waitress to ask for another pair of chopticks after one went flying from my co-diner's hands.  I knew not to expect the waitress to check on us.  I do feel for wait staff who don't speak English and I'm patient and point to what I want.  However, if we're both being polite and respectful, with a does of humour, usually staff and customer will get along just fine.  Not the case here.  This is not a Japanese-run place, and you will definitely not receive polite Japanese service.    I will never return."}
{"text":"They messed up my order.  Then you have to explain over and over again what they did wrong.  And to top it up, they offend you and call you a liar.  Apparently they can't do wrong.  The worst service ever!"}
{"text":"I visited this location last weekend with two friends and I was totally satisfied with the service and food I was provided. We had netsu ramen and tonkotsu ramen and the dumplings. It was perfect for the cold seasonal weather! I will come back to this place soon to try another dishes."}
{"text":"Having tried several of their ramens I feel like I only want to go back for the spicy ramen (level 1, 2, 3). The other choices are just so-so and for some of them the amount of the noodles is waaay too little (I'm a girl with a small appetite). The tables are a bit crowded as the kitchen takes up half of the space. It might be not comparable to the ramen in downtown Toronto, but hey it's the only ramen place in Mississauga as far as I know."}
{"text":"Iced matcha latte is a dream but $4 for a cup of half ice is too much. Wasn't greeted with a smile and had the menu thrown on the table. Another server told me I had to order right away or wait 15 mins for their new water to be ready. Then she hovered over me while I looked at the menu for a whole 30 seconds before pressuring me to order the 2 most popular dishes. I can make my own mind up thanks. At 330 on a Monday afternoon, this kind of attitude should not be acceptable in any restaurant. Servers need to work on finesse."}
{"text":"What an interesting little place! Snuck in just before lunch time (they open at 11:00) and was immediately seated. The waitress provided a menu and a glass of water at the same time.  I went for the King Shoyu Ramen and the 3 piece gyoza. The menu claims that the ramen has double the size and double the ingredients so it's a good thing I went for it because I was really hungry. It came with 1 baby bok choy, 4 pieces of pork belly, 3 soft boiled egg halves, nori and green onions. There was ample ramen. Broth was piping hot which was good even though today was nice out. I absolutely cannot stand it when the broth is not hot enough. The gyoza arrived 10 minutes after the ramen which would have bothered some people but not me. They were very large and cooked (microwaved?) to perfection. Sauce was delicious too.  The music was a mishmash of all sorts of styles (were they hoping to appeal to everyone??) -- hip hop, k-pop, 80's power ballads, gangsta rap, repeat. So weird. But enjoyable!  The crowd was weird. Single asian businessmen, university students, families with babies and seniors.  In and out in 30 minutes -- they've got corporate lunch hour down cold. I'll be back -- but there are a ton of other REALLY interesting looking restaurants in the same strip and vicinity!"}
{"text":"The tonkotso ramen is definitely tasty.  But considering the cost, it would be nice to get more noodles"}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars, but service was a bit slow. We had the King of Ramen and the Tonkatsu Miso ramen. The King hit the spot for me, just the perfect amount of spicy, and a full bowl of ramen to fill my hunger."}
{"text":"Much like other posters,  this place is just average.  If you've got an itch for Ramen,  this is the only place to get it scratched outside of Toronto.   If this was served up in Toronto, I can guarantee I wouldn't be back.  Limited menu with bland flavors, it's really nothing special.  The staff is nice though. I guess I'll keep coming when I have a need for ramen and can't get into the city."}
{"text":"After returning from Japan a few weeks ago, I was seriously craving some yakisoba - and Kenzo Ramen showed up in a few searches as having the best in Toronto. For the record - they don't. What they do have is a very nice pan-fried noodle served on a searing hot metal hotplate that is quite overpriced.  This restaurant is quite small and seating is cramped, but you could fit a group of 8 in the front if you used up all their tables. If you're sitting up on the upper landing near the kitchen you'll find it quite stuffy and you'll leave smelling like you walked out of a deep fryer.   They offer tacoyaki (sic) on their menu (which made my sister and I giggle) - but also offer it without octopus using ingredients like shrimp or cheese, etc if you prefer; in which case it can't be takoyaki since there's no tako in it (Ebiyaki anyone?)!   Service was lack-luster, but neither friendly nor rude. They accept credit cards on purchases over $10. There is a washroom on site for customers.   I didn't feel I got my money's worth here, and I probably won't be back. The yakisoba at Okonomi House is better (although still not authentic enough for me) and less expensive, and I can find cheaper ramen elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"My bf has been asking me to go here with him for weeks. So, although based on reviews I was skeptical to try it out, I decided to be a good gf, and caved in. *Sigh*   We came here on a particularly chilly afternoon and were seated right away. At first we were given a table right by the door, but it was so drafty outside that I asked them to move us to a table inside. Once we got in we realized that there was lots of tables available in the restaurant, so I don't understand why they would sit us by the the door.   We were handed our menus by a somewhat pleasant server, and left alone to make our choices. A bonus of getting a seat at the back of the restaurant was that we had prime view of the kitchen and could see the chefs preparing our meals. The negative side of this? The chef really did not seem to appreciate my curious glances towards his workplace. Actually, at one point he stared me down. After that, I stopped glancing.   Another big big bonus of getting a seat in the back? We got to watch the lady who makes the dumplings hard at work. It was very interesting to be able to see her stuff the dough with the filling, and the shape it into the perfect little dumplings. Sweet. And unlike her grumpier coworker, she did not seem to mind my tentative glances.   I chose the King of Kings, the bf had the Orochong Ramen, and we also got an order of gyoza. Maybe it was just me, because based on other reviews people seem to really enjoy the King of Kings, but I did not like it one bit. It wasn't awful, but it really just wasn't good either. It had no real flavour, and was rather boring and were it not for its gigantic size, unimpressive. Blah.   The Orochong on the other hand was better. I enjoyed the flavour and kick in the broth much more, and though it seemed to be lacking on the ingredients, the broth sort of made up for it.   The dumplings were delicious. The right size and texture, and so very fresh. Truly a delight to eat, and the only reason this place isn't getting 2 stars.   Service wasn't awful, and the servers were kind of nice really, rushed and impersonal, but at least we got \"thank-you's\" and \"bye's\"."}
{"text":"For a girl who does NOT have a likeing for ramen... This place was AWESOME! My boyfriend and I stopped by after getting bubble tea at cha time, it was around 5 pm. I did not wait in line and the staff is super friendly. I was hesitant to try but they have truly changed my taste for noodles. I also love their gyoza. It was kind of sweet which gave it a shock of flavour but it was amazing. I definitely recommend trying this place out even if you aren't a fan of ramen."}
{"text":"Although there's plenty of Japanese ramen places around this was the closest. The reviews are kind of mixed but I decide to give it a try. I regret my decision and will never go to another Kenzo again. The soup, was supposed to be pork bone based, tonkotsu, but wasn't even close to it. It was basically water with a little bit of soup broth or something phone in for flavor. The noodles are pretty soggy for what I considered to be good Japanese noodles. The pork pieces were plenty and that it was the best thing about ramen.  After living in Japan for many years perhaps I've got gotten used to good that man with great soup. This place couldn't satisfy either."}
{"text":"Ramen is soo good here, each time I stop by Toronto I almost have to come here.  I usually get the king of kings which is a big portion.  Quick Service"}
{"text":"this place is great, my stars are purely based on food taste and portion.   - orders the Netsu Ramen and portion wise, I couldn't finish it. Super tasty, I just needed a pinch more salt.  - Very flavourful and noodles were excellent and handmade.  - price matched the quantity of food you got  - this place is always HELLA busy, there's a line out the door, wait is anywhere from 15-30 mins."}
{"text":"The ramen is ok but a bit salty and it's very busy and crowed. You barely got any service from the waitress and waiters."}
{"text":"This place is solid!   It's not the best ramen I've had, but I can't complain at all.   It's a fairly small place, borderline cramped. I came with a friend and we had to shove our bags under the table as we were placed up against a wall with just enough room to shimmy between the tables to the inside seat.  The food came quickly, the noodles were cooked properly, and the broth was decent. It wasn't too expensive either. Solid for lunch or a cheap dinner."}
{"text":"I usually order the Tonkotsu ramen which has a very tasty, nice and creamy broth to it.  Tasty, cheap and fast ramen joint.  Can't go wrong with that"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Kenzo Ramen Cuisine: Japanese Location: Dundas Square Address: 138 Dundas St W Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 2 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 2.5  Extra information:  *Korean Owned *Specializes in Japanese Ramen *Open for lunch  Kenzo is a Korean owned Japanese ramen shop- so would it taste authentic? nope of course not. Does it taste good? it's decent but nothing special.  It was my second time here and I don't even really like Japanese ramen to begin with. The only reason I went back to this place for the second time knowing it's nothing fabulous after the first time, was because I was craving noodles and couldn't find anything else that was close to where I was at.  So my expectation wasn't set high and I was just craving some hot Asian soup! When you walk in, it usually takes them a while to get to you since the kitchen/employee area is inconveniently located at the back. Don't expect them to smile at you, people working here are the most emotionless Koreans I've ever seen in my life.  Ordered: Kenzo Tonkatsu Miso Ramen, $8.95. This comes with few pieces of bokchoy(veggies), bean sprout, 3-4pieces of pork, 1/2 boiled eggs and green onion on top. Soup is pork bone based so it's smooth and creamy. The noodle is thin and has instant-freezer noodle texture to it.  I would never expect to find authentic Japanese ramen in Canada...especially because I've tried real ramen in Japan and the noodles were SO damn chewy it was the best ever! But Kenzo is ok once in awhile if you are harsh craving some ramen.   Summary: I find the price sort of expensive for the quality of food you get especially when they don't use fresh ramen. I would go back if I was craving ramen until I can find a better spot (I really hope I can)"}
{"text":"Best ramen that I ever tried, will come back soon. Haha,  Takoyaki is special and delicious, a little bit sour and really like it."}
{"text":"I had king of king ramen so good"}
{"text":"Okay love with place.  Great service.  Great food the staff is all great very well coming.  Other places should learn from this place 10/10 ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen shops. I've tried two other Kenzo's, and the quality and taste at this location is the best.   The food is great at this location and the service is fast. I recommend trying the pork katsu or the takoyaki. They are so good!   If you're a spicy fan, the spicy chasu ramen is legit spicy and tastes really great. The portion size is great.   My only recommendation is that they expand their shop. There's always a line out the door and I think it's opened the door for some competition."}
{"text":"This used to be the only ramen place on Dundas and now it has been usurped by much better ramen joints.   Granted, Kenzo showed up first and has retained it's laid back feel while some of the newer ramen restos are crowded and too cool for school.  The noodles at Kenzo are the eggy kind that I dislike. The soup in the tonkotsu ramen is milky like the way it should be.   The takoyaki balls are pretty good but they (gasp) have gotten smaller!   Sansotei down the street on the opposite side closer to University Ave is far better tasting and better priced. Go there instead..."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal at Kenzo today with my colleague. For lunch, I was pretty shocked at how large the portion was. I got the Netsu Ramen. It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it was still quite tasty. The pork had nice flavour and the broth was definitely the best part. I've been to other ramen places that offer condiments and other things you can add to your dish. That may have been a nice addition just to add some more flavours and options. Overall though, I was happy with my meal and would go back."}
{"text":"Great food for the price you're paying. The service is quick and attentive. I wish there was more seating, but for the location (right beside Chatime!) you can't really complain. If you come during peak times you will definitely be waiting for a while but it's well worth the wait. This place always satisfies my ramen cravings!"}
{"text":"The Netsu ramen I ordered was full of flavour and had generous amounts of ground pork, vegetables, and noodles. The noodles were chewy, and the pork was marinated just right.   One real downside to my noodles was that although they tasted amazing, my throat is reeling from the sodium and I've downed several glasses of water as a result.  The decor is quite nice as well. Since it was early on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was half-empty and relatively quiet. The tables are well-proportioned so that you don't bump elbows with everybody at your table.   Wait staff were friendly, and had the initiative to ask when we were ready to order, whether we'd like a glass refill, and how we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"This is definitely hands down the best restaurant if one is craving for ramen. Their food is made in-house and you would actually see one of their staff sitting at one of the tables making dumplings if your lucky enough. I always order the either the Gyoza (pork dumplings) or the Takoyaki (octopus) to start and then the King of Kings ramen for the main dish with a side dish of extra noodles. I did try the Sho-Yu Ramen but I was not really fond of it. Wait time to be seated can vary from 0-60 minutes depending on the time and day, Friday nights and the weekends are the worst. My only caveat here is the service, it's little to non-existent. It's a very small restaurant with only a few tables, there are about 3- 4 servers and yet I had to wait at least 30-40 minutes for water or I had to flag down a server to get my glass refilled. Don't even expect to have your table cleared before your main dish comes if you order any appetizers, the servers will leave the serving dish from the appetizers until after you've paid your bill which can make for a pretty crowded table. There is no initiative among the servers. You have to flag them down to get service. Also, the price went up a couple dollars since I last came in, I used to pay about $13 for the King of Kings ramen but now it rang up to about $15. Food is still worth the visit but $15 for a bowl of ramen coupled with poor service and a long wait time seemed a little over the top."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen thank you for popping my first ramen experience cherry!  The location was great and just walking distance from Wellesley station.  Service was quick and attentive.  You have to wait a bit before you can eat your ramen, it was steaming hot! The broth was delicious!   I thought the ramen was great but I was told later than Kenzo is middle of the road for Japanese standards.    Despite being a ramen newbie, I will be back to Kenzo for a cheap dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"When I first visited Kenzo Ramen in Downtown Core, I was very disappointed because their ramen, gyoza, and takoyaki were very salty with a taste of MSG. My friend and I literally drank 6 glasses of water - no kidding! As a result, I was hesitated to try the Mississauga one because of my terrible experience earlier, but I still gave it a shot because my boyfriend really wanted to try it out! Surprisingly, after a few visits, I have become a regular customer of Kenzo now. I like it a lot more than the one in Downtown.  I am not a big fan of their ramen, but I really recommend you guys to try out their rice items. Their Gyudon and Tonkatsu set are oishii! However, my favourite is their Salmon Origini. It is definitely a must-try item!   P.s. I only drank 1.5 glasses of water during my visit in Kenzo today!"}
{"text":"If you want Ramen and want quantity then go to Kenzo. Their portions are very big and are not shy of any toppings. Their noodles are refreshing and their broth is very tasty. Not too salty and not too sweet.  Their menu holds just enough selection for everyone, with a good amount of appetizers to choose from.   They have many locations across the GTA making it very convenient to satisfy your craving.  As per my previous reviews for other ramen restaurants, I would not consider this one of my top ramen restaurants. With competition quickly closing in, I find they each have their own specialties. Kenzo specializes in quantity, Kinton specializes in their artisty in making ramen, Hakata specializing in their special variations of ramen, Momofuku specializes in their experience etc. This is my opinion at least. I would just go to Sansotei or Santouka downtown. They have much better ramen, broth and EGG. My rule of thumb is if they jappy then i'm happy meaning they are run by the japanese rather then others such as Chinese or koreans. I like my food as traditional as possible.  Would I recommend this place? Yes, only if you are hungry and want a convenient place for ramen."}
{"text":"I have been to other Kenzo locations and by far this is the worst I have ever had. What a shame!  I ordered a tonkotsu ramen indicating that I want spicy level 2. When the ramen came, the broth was not red at all like how the menu looked. It just looks like any regular ramen. I confirmed with the girl once again if that is the level 2 spiciness and she went, the broth is spicy itself and you can just add your own chili to it. Well, then that is not level 2 spicy ramen, is it? What is the point of offering different levels of spiciness on your menu then?   The pork is chewy and dry The noodles are SO OVERCOOKED, I can't even continue to eat it, it is THAT SOGGY I ended up ordering dumplings as the noodles were that bad The dumplings were oily and not pan-fried-dry enough, could have done better...  Please walk away, there are tons of ramen choices in downtown."}
{"text":"The service is mediocre but I love the soup.  I got the miso ramen. The noodles and meat tasted super fresh.    This is also near the Courtyard at Marriott hotel on Yonge Street.   I came by a little after 8p with my daughter knocked out on her stroller. The restaurant was clean and there was tons of seating.   When it's cold outside and your nearby, this is the spot! I don't think you can go wrong with a little good ol' miso ramen  soup."}
{"text":"Every time I step into this Kenzo, I swear the amount of noodles in the ramen gets less and less.  It's gotten to the point where even though the ramen is slightly cheaper than Sansotei almost right across the street, it's still not worth it because I have to run to McDonald's after to feel full.  I will give Kenzo credit for the food though, it does taste good. Noodles are always well-cooked, and the broth is neither too salty nor too bland. The meat tastes good and there is a variety to choose from on an easy-to-read menu.  There just needs to be more food in the bowl..."}
{"text":"Busy location and for good reason! I've been here a couple of times but never loved ramen in General up until recently. I've never had a bad experience here. The servers, atmosphere, and food are all great.   I've tried gyudon, gyoza, takoyaki, tonkatsu ramen, and a couple other styles of ramen that I cannot remember but they've all still been great"}
{"text":"Came here and it was mid day and there was no line up. I am gluten free and thought I had said non-breaded chicken and didn't. They replaced my order when I spoke to them and they were very nice about it. Overall, 5 stars because they made me feel welcomed and the food was delicious for Ramen in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Best place to get authentic Japanese ramen. We went there on our day off and it was around during lunch hour. They get busy quick and we waited only 10 mins. When you get called to sit, the staff greet you and you are offered a drink of your choice.    My wife ordered the tonkotsu ramen and I got the kings of kings ramen with the gyoza as an appetizer. The gyoza was cooked perfectly with the soy sauce for dipping. My ramen order was simply the best. It was the right choice of soup to eat on a cold day. The noodles were perfect. My wife's ramen soup tasted hearty like the soup you would eat if you needed to fight a cold. Both orders were worth it. My wife was so full from her serving that she had to take the rest home. It was really good food.  I recommend for anyone that would go to try the gyoza. It was worth it and as well as the other soups.   My wife and I will definitely come back but this time with the kids."}
{"text":"If I visit this place, I need to wait for 5 out of 10 times. But, this place worth it! If you are new for Japanese Ramen, this is a good starting place. Love shoyu ramen and donkotsu ramen! Good for weekday lunch for sure :)"}
{"text":"The Tonkuzu ramen is sucks. Noodles are blend, broth is tastless. Never come here again."}
{"text":"I really like ramen but my first reaction was not great.  My girlfriend wanted some takeout appetizer my first time there and it took a really long time.  We saw so many people getting there order before us, even though they got in later and in one case ordered the same thing.  Anyways, we did go back since we both really like ramen.  It was faster the second time, was good and reasonably priced.  I probably would give them a 4 star rating if it wasn't for the first bad experience.  We were waiting for about 30 minutes for a very small takeout order.  They should have offered a coupon for something free at least or something.  They just made some lame excuses, we don't care, don't keep us waiting or do something to make up for it."}
{"text":"went in, girl took my order, went to washroom came back and saw fresh menus on my table. Another server walks over and I tell her someone else took my order. 15 mins later no ramen, inquired and they forgot. Usually wouldn't mind waiting another 10 mins, ramen don't take long to make. But wtf the 15 mins I was there, the place wasn't even busy, servers too busy singing k pop and talking to each other. no kinton, no decent ramen place in sauga...and never good experience at kenzo's."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Always busy, always fast as a noodle shop should be. Great selection of ramen and other one pot dishes. I've had many of them and they're all good.  Only thing I don't appreciate are the tako balls. Tako yes, tako balls no. Acquired taste I guess.  And they won't sell me one of their cool Tshirts. Which pisses me off... But I get over it.  Recommend for lunch or a fast dinner."}
{"text":"This wouldn't be the first ramen place I'd choose to go to if I was craving a bowl of yummy ramen, but I know I will enjoy my meal here (especially the tonkotsu ramen). Quality of noodles is just OK. I was served quickly, which was great because I was in a bit of a rush. I'd rate it more a 3.5 but it's a rounding down kind of day.   Note to future Ten from past Ten: remember to ask fo no bean sprouts. Saves you from picking them out! You always forget. You're welcome."}
{"text":"A simple menu selection, only ramen with some sides of gyoza or octopus balls. They also had a special of wonton ramen and yakisoba.  Food was good with a tasty broth which I finished completely. Had nice iced green tea latte as well, refreshingly cooling and delicious.  They only accept cash, debit cards and Visa only - no Mastercard.  Oh and they greet you with the warm \"irashaimase\" which made me feel like I was back in Japan. Be warned - they are very busy during lunchtime rush hours when there is often a queue."}
{"text":"So far the best egg noodle in mississauga ! The service is rough but they manage to handle it."}
{"text":"Had the tonkotsu ramen, and the broth was delicious. Prices were great as well. Service was a little below average, but it was busier than usual."}
{"text":"Not the best ramen I've had but not bad either. Customer service was quick and efficient. The restaurant is spacious compared to other ramen places I've been to. I ordered the King of Kings Ramen with extra meat.   The broth was okay, not too salty but not very spicy considering it was part of the spicy category. The noodles could be better and they put way too many bean sprouts in the bowl (although, if you like bean sprouts then this is indifferent to you). The meat was good, nothing out of the ordinary.   Kenzo is probably my backup ramen place since it's very close to my home. I prefer to eat ramen in downtown Toronto though."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen place in town. I suggest the Tonkotsu Ramen with level 1 spice, with takoyaki on the side."}
{"text":"One of my most favourite places to grab ramen! Everything is made from scratch, so you know it'll taste delicious! The menu has quite a variety for everybody. Personally, they serve the best Takoyaki I've ever tasted.  All employees are always welcoming and happy, considering how busy the place is from open to close! The workers are very busy bees, but they never make you feel rushed (even though there can be 10+ tables waiting to be seated after you! Lol) Always worth the wait when eating at Kenzo!"}
{"text":"Speed and efficiency! Yes!!! Perfect for the power lunch when working in the area.  Sadly though my \"spicy\" ramen (netsu style) bowl was super disappointing. It had absolutely zero spiciness and kick, and two of my lunch buddies who also got other spicy ramen bowls also said the same thing. Don't bother with Kenzo if you like it hot.   The ramen itself was great though, just right in terms of consistency.   Also I don't know how a spoon with a dried noodle right in the middle of it passed their quality control. O_o The waiter I flagged down was pretty quick in getting me a new one and also cashing us out though, so that was definitely appreciated."}
{"text":"I was there before for they open the store because my greyhound bus arrived early...when they open the door, I immediately ordered the house ramen. To my surprise, it came warm instead of hot, little slices of meat with my noodle soup. And my soup was just too salty so I asked for a cup of tea..but it was a tea bag tea with charge. I was very disappointed in their service. The waitress was busy talking to the guy cook instead of coming to check on my table. I had to walk to her to remind her that I was ready to pay the bill!!  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Kenzo, Kenzo, Kenzo... was so hyped for this place after reading the buzzy article in NOW (should really know better by now, but I digress) a month or so ago.  Good ramen. Proper ramen. Ramen for those who know it is so much more than Mr Noodle freeze-dried crap. This has been missing from the Toronto restaurant world and I entertained a bit of hope that the drought had come to an end.   Not so fast. After two visits to the recently opened Bathurst location my thirst for real ramen remains unfulfilled, and amazingly it's not because of the ramen itself, but the horrible service and atmosphere of the place. Anyone who has dined in Japan knows that good service, presentation and cleanliness are just as important as the dish that's placed in front of you.  Despite the Japonaiserie of the interior decor, and the menu, the Korean ownership of the restaurant is missing the boat. Misspellings abound in the written menu. \"Satporo\" ramen? really? With Korean info coming before English or Japanese on all items. These are forgiveable sins.   Less forgiveable is the service. It's been mentioned before. On my first visit it was neglectful but basically acceptable, at my table near the front windows. My second visit fixed that.   It was horrible. My companion had to ask three times for a simple water to be brought to our table; a loud cellphone kept ringing three inches behind my head, at the cash register, and the waitress refused to turn it off. The same waitress had no idea what I was talking about when I ordered an Asahi repeatedly. The slightly more competent waiter had to come and explain. I mean they have THREE BEERS ON THE MENU for goodness sake.   The coup de grace came when a nearby table hadn't received an order of gyoza 20 minutes after ordering, and asked them to forget it and just forget the bill. The staff argued with him, saying it was on the way, when clearly the order had not been passed to the kitchen yet. This debacle resulted in the head chef/owner man coming out and berating his wait staff noisily inKorean, in the middle of three tables of diners for at least five minutes.  Sure the waiters were at fault, but in the midst of this, the man who wanted to just get out of there without his late gyoza was ignored, forced to wait AND subjected to a tirade. What fun.  That reminds me... food! Yeah, there was some of that. It was not bad either, but after the ridiculously poor service and ambience I can barely remember."}
{"text":"I love ramen and ramen for $7 is awesome in my books. It's fast to get the food, fast to eat, tasty, delicious and cheap. I highly recommend the pork bone soup."}
{"text":"Food is good ...one of the best ramens spot in sauga. However food took forever ....waited more than 20 mins to come..."}
{"text":"This place always seems busy when we drive by. There is a sign in sheet when you arrive and a very small waiting area.  The tables a close together trying to fit in as many tables as they can, since it isn't a large place. The bathroom was clean and tidy. Much of the kitchen is visible from where you sit. Noodles etc are made in-house; We could see them making the Gyoza dumplings at one of the tables.  Service was quick. This one guy really takes the time to review the different menu items for first time customers and gave good honest recommendations.  We tried the Sho-yu Ramen which had a nice broth if you don't want any spiciness at all.  The pork was not as tender as I expected. I ate once at the downtown location, and the pork there was superior in texture and flavour.  Overall it was good though. The Tonkotsu ramen was also quite nice, it was light but had more of a creamier textured broth.  The Gyoza were smaller than expected but tasty and obviously fresh; it's good for sharing. The real star was the ramen for dipping, I can't recall the proper name. The ingredients came on a plate with a medium spicy and flavourful broth on the side. You can dip or pour it over the ingredients. I'll definitely try one of the other spicy ramen next time after enjoying the delicious broth."}
{"text":"My husband picked up takeout from Kenzo Ramen when I was incredibly sick with the flu. Thank god for the spicy broth, meat, veggies and noodles in the Netsu soup. I had not proper meal in over 24 hours and this soup gave me life. I have visited this location many times but this was our first time doing takeout. I was impressed with the quantity we were given. We ordered 2 soups and it was enough to eat for two meals. I was worried that the noodles would lose their texture the next day but they were still perfect. I would absolutely do takeout again from Kenzo. Definitely a lifesaver when feeling under the weather."}
{"text":"Wow...this place took us by surprise. We came here looking for Ramen noodles in Mississauga.   I ordered Ji Su Mein, which was $10.95+tax so not bad for a lunch meal. The food itself was kind of light for me so you walk out not feeling bloated. The main problem is the broth for me as I was looking for a vegetarian option and these guys do have that. I read a lot of review and many reviewers found it too salty but in comparison to some other Cuisine I have tried are in the same line with as salt as these guys.   The service was fast, quick and the food was hot and severed very well in nice bowl. They are also making the food in front of you."}
{"text":"Who knew this gem of a place existed! We ordered the gyozo, tonkotsu and the black tonkotsu ramen.   First the service...it was fast. We got there around 6pm today and were seated right away. The server came over with our menus, got us waters and came back 5 mins later for our orders. Great so far.  Now the food...we got the food (gyoza) in about 5 minutes. The gyoza is bigger than your average gyoza..its savory and garlicky pork flavor with green onions. The dumpling was thin and crunchy on the outside with ample filling. Absolutely loved it!  The tonkotsu were both yummy...although I would lean more towards the black tonkotsu because I like the garlic flavor. The noodles were aldente and the chasu very soft and flavorful. The only miss was the egg isn't cooked to a soft gooey soft boil.   Overall a 4.5!"}
{"text":"Drove 4 hours for ramen, and would do it again for this place. Got the king of kings and it was very delicious, the meat was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The ramen comes with a side of gyoza, but we didn't know had already ordered the gyoza appetizer - the waiter failed to tell us that. Would have been even better if the egg was salted, which it was not here.  But no one goes to an Asian restaurant expecting great service. So long as the food comes in a timely manner and they give you clean looking water and utensils, that's all you need.   I really enjoyed the king of kings ramen - whatever the husband got, he didn't like as much. It was a regular ramen so avoid that."}
{"text":"The only Ramen in town.... literally... well in Mississauga anyways.  If you can't handle the heat just get level 1 or 0.  Level 3 will have you sweating.   Level 5 will have you sipping air and and wondering how you will be able to eat your food"}
{"text":"Food was so so but service was suck. Only three table was taken, waiters were sitting behind and chatting. I raised and waved my hand several times and nobody notice. Finally the bill came out with 17% gratuity....They even didn't ask how much tips you like to pay, they just sum up with 17% gratuity. Who wants to pay 17% for that kind of service? Be careful....so not Japanese"}
{"text":"So I think this will be a rolling review as I'm going to have to go back and experience Kenzo sometime actually sitting in the restaurant but until then I can review based on take out. I've been here a few times as it's right around the corner from my work and here's really nothing like Ramen Soup on rainy days.  I haven't had any issues at all with the take out service - I can walk in and out within 5 minutes with my soup so no complaints there. The one thing with take out is that sometimes there isn't a lot of space to stand while you wait if all the tables are taken.  I found the Shi-o Ramen a bit of a disappointment to be honest. It's basic ramen and the broth is good but just a bit ... underwhelming. The  Ji Su Men ($9.95) though on the other hand I thoroughly enjoy. It's a thicker soup with finely chopped chicken and a hint of sesame. It truly is a soup that just hits the spot on rainy days.  I'll go back to enjoy the actual restaurant experience sometime soon though."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing ramen! The wait is always long however totally worth it. I've had the miso based ramen, loved that it wasn't overly salty but full of flavour. The atmosphere is great, cozy and clean. Make sure you go there hungry, staff is also very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"First try ramen in Mississauga, taste is reall delicious , large bowl than others. I like it."}
{"text":"The ramen itself was Okay. Same as other kenzo franchise. However Toronto Dundas location is horrible. Terrible service, I didn't even finish my ramen completely and the bill came. The server was really impolite like I've done something wrong when I enter or something.  She threw the bill down, then in less then 3m She came by and took our ramen (tray) without asking If we finish or not. After all those, She dropped my bill without apologizing. And after She did not Thank my business Which is fine But whole experience was terrible. will Never return to this location and will not recommend anyone to."}
{"text":"First time to try non-instant ramen. Very clean and the food is very tasty. I went there on a weekday so it wasn't really busy."}
{"text":"We order from here at least once a week through Foodora. This is the best ramen in town in my opinion! I always have the Tonkatsu. It's the perfect amount of richness and always full of fresh ingredients. The boiled, marinated egg is so yummy and the noodles are always the perfect amount of chewy! This is my ultimate comfort food! Super affordable too and I'm always stuffed afterwards. My tummy thanks you Kenzo Ramen!"}
{"text":"Meh, they're mediocre. The Takoyaki is REALLY overpriced. The middle of the shell is mostly hollow with a piece of octopus. It's like really poorly made. The ramen is decent at best."}
{"text":"Ramen is taking a while to catch on around where I live, so I drive for 30 minutes to get it at Kenzo. And I'll tell you this; it's well worth the drive. The broth is flavorful, the noodles are just the right chewiness and the sides are made just right.   The last time I trekked out to Mississauga, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a side of gyoza. The smokiness of the pork topping was wonderful against the savory broth and the sweetness of the pork & onion dumplings was a satisfying contrast.  I envy those who can pop into Kenzo ramen shop whenever the weather gets cold, for me, it's a rare treat for when I can spare a few hours, but I look forward to it whenever the occasion presents itself.  This spectacular Japanese version of Asian comfort food is absolutely a must while you're in the area of this or any Kenzo Ramen Shop."}
{"text":":| Nowhere near top compared to the many other ramen restaurants nearby. The interior is sad, dark, and has an old vibe, they should do a bit of renovation at this point. Menu selection is small, and all the descriptions sound very similar and not that delicious to begin with. Prices are decent for a few at the beginning $8 but their portion sizes are way smaller than the ones reaching up to around $14 which is a bit overpriced for ramen. Service is quick.   I got the king of king shoyu ramen. Broth was hot which I enjoy but it really does taste like soy sauce mixed with water and that's it. Cha siu wasn't too good, it was tough and didn't have the layers of thin fat in between. Soft boiled eggs had a decent cook, would've enjoyed them more if they were runnier. Overall, very little toppings compared to the amount of noodles which were pretty good. I tried a bit of my friend's nagasaki seafood ramen. Her broth was a lot richer and creamier with a hint of seafood flavour. I tried a mussel and it was big in size."}
{"text":"When I go to Kenzo I order either the Shoyu ramen or the Tonkotsu ramen.  Shoyu ramen tastes amazing and is one of the cheapest ramen bowls on the menu. The downside is that the portion is very small that I have to order extra noodles (worth it, though).  Tonkotsu ramen has a really nice creamy taste and I love the veggies that come with it.  Why does it get 5 stars? Because as a self-proclaimed ramen fanatic I've been to MANY restaurants in Toronto that serve ramen. Kenzo in my opinion is one of the best, if not the best. A lot of people would disagree with me but if you think about it (interior design and service aside), Kenzo ramen TASTES the best (in my opinion).  - The marinated egg: I find that a lot of ramen restaurants don't soak the eggs long enough or aren't giving it enough flavour. Although the egg is cooked to perfection, most of the time it just tastes like a plain egg. Kenzo ramen does this the best. Their egg is marinated to perfection and I sometimes order an extra slice to calm my cravings.   - The sliced pork: The only downside is I wish Kenzo would give more pork in all their ramen bowls because it's so good! Again it's something about how well they marinate the meat that gives it really good flavour compared to other ramen restaurants I've been to.  - Tonkotsu ramen: Kenzo's tonkotsu ramen is consistently very good. When I order tonkotsu at other restaurants sometimes it will taste a bit burnt. Maybe they boiled it for too long?  The consistency is what I love.   - Shoyu ramen: At other places shoyu ramen can be too salty because of the soya sauce flavour. At Kenzo, it's always made to perfection."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Japanese ramen consider its something my mom has made since I was young. Nothing like having a hot bowl of noodles and delicious toppings on a cold day.  I've frequented the dundas location and the yonge st. one. Both are very good, but here's my thoughts on this loc. I've ordered in the past the tonkotsu, sho-yu, shi-yo, miso and one last one I can't remember.  PRO - Much more spacious than the dundas location, so getting a seat is less of a hassle - Less busy when I went here (around 7:30) so serve was prompt - Can't say food was much different, but again consistently good for a fair price  CON - Not positive, but I thought the matcha iced latte was made better at the dundas location  The Sho-yu is my fav and good if you don't want something too big. The tonkotsu is also delicious but much more filling. This chain is surprisingly decent considering the people who run it are not Japanese."}
{"text":"Really good ramen! So many options! Only problem is the staff had absolutely no idea what vegan meant. We had to ask 4 different staff members before they finally understood it. Other than the lack of communication, everything was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was happy to not get caught in a lunch time lineup. Unfortunately the tsuke-men and level 3 spicy charsu ramen were not available.   Tried the level 2 charsu ramen and it was really spicy but tasty. It came with more meat than expected but no egg (the egg in my picture was from my friend's dish). I thought the portions were good for lunch and the service was fast. I thought the texture of the noodles was just right (I prefer al dente to softer noodles).   Downsides: not very accomodating to customizing orders and items on the menu not being available   Upsides: allows splitting bills, fast, affordable and good location  I would eat here again but not one of my top choices for Toronto ramen."}
{"text":"Generic ramen. Decent service. Back maybe seven ten years ago they were one of the only options around and was good. Nowadays there are better options in the city."}
{"text":"It'd be a 5, except their portions are too small for me.  We came at 5pm on a Sunday and there was only 1 other couple there.  I like it when places are quiet and I can talk to my wife.  The soup is salty, but delicious.  Ramen is smooth, and tasty.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Would I come back?  Maybe.  The area has so many restos to choose from.  If I needed a small bite, I'd perhaps come here again.  It's just that it'd take $20 to get me full."}
{"text":"I spent 4 years in Japan while I was in the U.S. Air Force and had my fair sampling of all the great ramen houses.  Retired now for almost 6 years in the U.S., I have been on the constant search for an authentic Japanese ramen noodle house. Im traveling on business and my search ends here at Kenzo Japanese Noodle House!! This is as authentic as it gets and I highly encourage everyone to give this a try! You won't be disappointed! The wait maybe a little bit long but take that as a testament on how good this place really is. My only disappointment is my business trip will soon come to an end! Residents of Ontario; you are very lucky!!!"}
{"text":"Ramen is such a comfort for us Canadians on those cold winter days. So I am a big supporter for trying out the rising number of ramen restaurants in Toronto. I had ordered the Tonkotsu bowl. I always do appreciate the deep flavors of ramen soup. This broth was a big disappointment. It lacked thickness, dept, and comfort. It was just \"ok.\" The server was very kind to give me his favorite recommedation. Thumbs up for good customer service. But thumbs down for being just \"okay.\"  I have been to many other ramen restaurants, but this was a let down. Price wise, it is affordable and under $12. Customer service was great that day. Our server greeted us with a smile and ended it with a bigger smile. But then again, his smiles weren't going to safisfy my cravings for good ramen!"}
{"text":"Kenzo is only one of three ramen spots that I've tried and is in third place. The other two are Isshin and Kinton which are nearby and competing for my attention. It wasn't very busy when I went there on my own, and had a subdued and relatively quiet atmosphere compared to the other two spots which were incredibly busy and had an urgency to them. Maybe I was there between rushes though. In fact Kenzo felt more like a nice family diner even though it had all the right ingredients to be a contender in the ramen wars we are all a part of. Maybe the frenzied atmosphere is what helps make the ramen taste so good. For example, reading the tips and tricks section at Isshin they mention that you should finish your bowl of ramen in 8 minutes for maximum enjoyment of the ingredients. Take any longer and it goes downhill from there.  I had the cold sake for a side to the soup, but I didn't notice a beer swilling haze happening while I was there which seems to be a part of the ritual of enjoying a hot bowl of salty sublime broth and crispy pieces of tender chicken or nibbling edamame. All this seems to take away from the flavour. Maybe if I was blindfolded or did a double blind test the results would be different."}
{"text":"The place and atmosphere were great-- turns out that the cuisine just wasn't for me though. Def come here if you like authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible, if you're debating, just go. Get king of kings and some dumplings and you will deff be back to try other soups on the menu. Avoid dinner time as lines are crazy. Service is pretty fast. Usual wait time is 10-15 min for the soup. Dumplings come in like 5. Me and my friend got blown away though one day when we decided to time them and our entire order came in two and a half minutes. No bad choices on the menu."}
{"text":"When this opened, it quickly became my go-to spot for ramen. I always got the Netsu ramen, which is a spicy ramen dish with chicken and a generous amount of vegetables. The portion is pretty big, filling, and has such a nice flavor. Even though I'm not one to drink broth in soups, this is one that I like drinking because it's just that good. I'm pretty sure the ramen I've had here has been the best ramen I've ever had at a restaurant and I would love to come back here again some day. The only problem is that it's quite busy a lot of the time and the restaurant is a bit small, so it's not really the best place for larger parties (even going as a party of 5 can feel crowded)."}
{"text":"Relative to the other ramen places that I've been to, this one didn't particular impress me neither with quality or presentation of the dish. I came here with a group of four and found that space wasn't optimized as they could consider using benches instead of large chairs with hand rests that have an open back. This was inconvenient going in and out and the open back of the chair wasn't helpful holding our purses. The prices were standard and selection was average. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen for $10.95.  Food quality: A few things to note about my ramen was that the meat and egg were both slightly overcooked for my liking. The soup base was mediocre as it was not rich in flavour but kudos to them for not making it too salty.  Overall impression: I wouldn't crave to come back to this place but wouldn't reject the idea of going again."}
{"text":"I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and the soup and the pork were great. The noodles not so much. And I also order Gyoza and they were amazing!! I would need to try other ramen to rate better, because they have plenty of types of different ramen. Definitely, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Ill definitely be back when the weather gets colder. I got the Netsu Ramen. Only complaint was that the meat was rather lacking!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not much of a ramen connoisseur but felt that this restaurant offers good quality ingredients, generous portions, and an inviting ambiance at an affordable price. If anything, the broth was a bit on the salty side, but perhaps that's just how it's supposed to be done. I had the king of kings ramen, which was just spicy enough to my liking and rich enough to satiate my hunger by the end of it."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian broth!!  so glad we found this place that serves different style broths for those who dont eat pork!  The place is extremely cramped but the service is fast and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come back here - the ramen is nothing to write home about. I had the Tonkatsu ramen: noodles were alright, the broth was salty (no favour, just salty), not much in terms of toppings. There are definitely better ramen places in the city."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Kenzo after after not wanting to brave the wait at Sansotei. It was very quaint and warm -  felt a little like home. The service was welcoming and prompt and the food was timely.  We started with the Takoyaki and it was good. I have never had it before and was pleasantly supposed. But because i have never had it before, I can't really tell if it is as good as I think it is - you know, because I have nothing to compare it to.   The actual Raman though was good with really hardy serving sizes. Although, the serving sizes between the dishes did not seem to be consistent, which had my friend a little disgruntled because her bowl seem significantly smaller than ours.   They had such good rich broth. It was on the salty side but i love my food salty so it didn't bother me in the slightest. The pork was a bit on the tough side unlike the pork at Sansotei. The noodles were phenomenal! They were the perfect bounciness to them I was very happy to get such a large portion of noodles (my favourite part of any Raman dish).   I think this is my new spot for Raman to be honest. Sansotei is too busy for my liking and I always feel rushed when I eat there. I like the atmosphere of Kenzo much more. It makes me feel more comforted and Raman is my comfort food - so it just makes sense. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"***I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could!***  As I opened the door, the delicious scent of ramen wafted into my nose. I waited 15mins for a table, watching people slurp down their noodles as I slurped down my saliva in anticipation.   The service and ambiance were great. It was warm, cozy, we'll ventilated, and filled with people. Looking around, there is a sign on the wall that proudly states that they make their noodles, gyoza, ground pork and Takoyaki in house.  True enough, I was seated beside a staff member who was painstakingly hand-folding gyoza. So mesmerizing to watch, really makes you appreciate the time it takes to make vs. eat one.  I was captivated by the King of Ramen bowl. With a name like that, it sounded decadent. I had to have it. It was interesting, different from any other ramen I've ever had. It tasted like a korean fusion ramen, as the spicy, red broth was wok-fried with ground pork/mushrooms/beansprouts/carrots/green onion - very similar to the veggy mix you might see accompanying a teriyaki dish. I think that this is the netsu ramen ($9.95), but for $3 more, the \"King\" comes with chasiu x 3, half an egg, one slice of fishcake, bamboo shoots and seaweed. I wonder if the taste of this dish was influenced by the fact that this franchise is Korean-run. In hindsight, I wish I'd examined the menu more thoroughly (too hungry!), and perhaps ordered a more traditional ramen to properly review this place as the tonkotsu, shio and shoyu broth bases were also available.   I am on the hunt for the perfect Takoyaki, just like in Osaka. Since they make their own, I had to try it. It came with 6 pieces, a nice share plate appy. I'd have to say that the skin was thicker/denser than I liked and the tako a bit small, but big props to it being handmade!"}
{"text":"Oh man! So good!  I always get the King's Ramen and it has a rich, deep smokiness to the broth that is so addictive. I also love all the components; different kinds of seaweed, tea egg, fish cake etc.  Also; Octopus Bals are yummy pillowy marshmallows of savoury-sweet deliciousness.  This place gets some pretty low ratings which I really don't understand as it is certainly the best Ramen I have had in the city.  Also; last time I was there, Marc Thuet and his wife snaked our table the moment we got up to pay. Conviction Kitchen!"}
{"text":"This kenzo location is not as good as the one in Korean town. The portion is always smaller. And one time I found a thread of steel wool (that they might have used to wash dishes with) in my ramen soup. Since that time I almost finished my ramen I didn't say anything to them. But the next time I went there with my friend I found a small fly in my soup and I couldn't help but tell the waitress. They didn't charge me for my bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Have come here on several occasions. The first time was actually not bad but one of the next times I came here I came with a girlfriend and we were just going in to eat and catch up. We were sat next to another couple who were chowing down already on some soup while we looked at our menu's.  The food was okay as per usual but this one day in particular my friend and I were giggling away at sweet gossip and not too sure if the couple sitting next to us was having a bad day or what but they were both silent and it was mad awkward that my friend and I just kept giving each other some raised looks.  Other than that it reminds me of Ajisen just a tad and nothing really jumps out at me in this case. I'm glad there's a location closer to me up in North York. Convenient!"}
{"text":"First time here and wanted to check out the hype. My friend had the Spicy charsu ramen and it's very tasty. She had the Level 0.5 for spice and said she could have easily handled the next level. I had the Nagasaki Chamon. Good portion of seafood but I don't like mussels and they don't accommodate changes.  One of the shrimp in the soup was too soft and inedible. Good flavours but next time I will have the Spicy Charsu. We also had the Takoyaki...I wouldn't recommend. Small piece of octopus in a cheesy ball."}
{"text":"Boo. Donno what was up with the waitress who seated us. 3 people standing around to be seated must have been look like a group of rapists to her eyes. I wish she had no facial expression just like my fellow Korean fobby friends but no, her face was saying she was extremely annoyed by something. Hope it was not us, cause I can't stand people hating me for no reason.  Once my sensitive, jaded soul got seated I already had enough with her attitude. But my love for ramen+empty stomach made me stay. Sigh... Thankfully she didn't get to serve us after.   When we were ready to order, other waiter took us over. He was nice. Politely took our order and even asked us if we wanted cold water!!  After that, just same old lunch at Kenzo. Light, Salty soup (yes, cold water is mandatory)and big, juicy gyoza.  I don't think their ramen is exceptional. OF COURSE i had better. But it's passable in Toronto standards.   Service wise? Umm... Fuck no."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????----?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Few places deserve a second review, but this place does. We've been back at least 5x since my last review and have been increasingly impressed with the food.   After discovering the Spicy Cha Suu ramen, I have to admit I was hooked. This is the best spicy ramen I have had - hands down.   I get the .25 spice level, the waitress smiles and notes \"you've been here before\". And I love it every time. Spicy, creamy, delicious. A generous portion, fresh ingredients, and fast service. This is not a place to linger. There are always lineup, but worth the wait. You come in, eat, and get out - then dream of the next time you can come back."}
{"text":"Five stars for this place since it's been the only ramen place I have ever been to that is serious about their spicy ramen being spicy.   Most ramen joints have a spicy ramen that's a joke that has a subtle spice to it.  Their spicy challenge ramen is insanely spicy.  I only did the least spicy from their special list and my mouth was on fire and I was sweating bullets.  You know it has to be spicy if they're willing to comp your meal if you're dumb and able to finish the whole bowl, broth and all."}
{"text":"We didn't try the ramen, but we had the Gyoza and Takoyaki. The dishes were fine, but not surprisingly delicious. Maybe we expected too much. People who know Toronto well said they won't suggest this restaurant as a good place for Ramen."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars I'm really getting into the Ramen noodle thing. I tried this place a few times and the soup was good each time. This location is rather small and I had to wait about 30 minutes at lunch to get a table. Once seated, the service was good and the food arrived quickly. My fav is the Tonkotsu Ramen but also like King if Kings. Prices are in the $8 - $12 range. The Goyza was also good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and was pleasantly surprised.   The gyoza was simply amazing. The meat to wrapper ratio was absolutely spot on and worth the $9. Loved that they were pan fried and came with 2 saucers of dipping sauce!  I ordered the King of Kings Ramen bowl and that was extremely filling and satisfying. The noodles were cooked perfectly and was neither mushy nor too underdone. The broth could've been spicer (will ask it to be spicer next time) but was well balanced otherwise. Only complaint was their liberal use of salt.   Staff were swift and courteous, refilled our water glasses without being asked.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kenzo is a great ramen place in Toronto that rarely ever has line ups and the service is super quick.  I usually frequent the Bloor location, but the first one I tried was the Yonge Street spot.  The place is pretty clean inside and looks like your standard ramen house decor.  The staff are friendly, but you'll have to call them over at times as they are usually busy with the kitchen or serving.  The ramen here is a little greasy, but the taste is pretty good.  The broth isn't as clean as I'm used to with places like Kinton and Sansotei taking over as my favourites.  Also the various toppings aren't cooked as well or as delicately as those shops I've mentioned.  They add more of a Chinese flare with their vegetables and toppings over the traditional Japanese ramen, but it works well.  If I'm in a pinch and need to get something quick to eat Kenzo is a good place to go.  the ramen portions are also the largest out of any other ramen shops in the GTA and their fried dumplings will fill you up alone.  The price is right and the food is good, so definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Place is well maintained and has AC -  so bless. The portions are perfect and very filling- and that's coming from a person who can eat a lot. Warning the portions are big for the more expensive ramen. The cheaper ramen are still filling though even if you're pretty hungry. Good taste and perfectly chewy noodles."}
{"text":"My roommate and I came here before Nerd night for a quick snack. We both opted for the King of King Ramen. I like Ramen and it was decent with alot of textures, including the egg, the noodles, the pork and the seaweed. Broth was okay with a bit of bite. It was good and filling but I will keep looking for other options!"}
{"text":"After living in Japan a couple years ago, coming home was a bit tough knowing that i'd miss the taste of japanese ramen.    my mission was to find a ramen shop that could come close to the authentic stuff.   So i decided to check out Kenzo this past summer.  i arrived around 730pm in the evening and it was full.  i didn't mind waiting but the one thing that already soured my mood was that we (my gf and i) weren't even greeted.  i watched the waiter and waitress walk pass us not even making the time to recognize that we were there.  other customers started showing up behind us and still, no one greeted.  about 30 mins passed and we finally got a seat.  we order two bowls of ramen and gyoza.  it took about 20 mins for the ramen to be made and reach our table.  first thing i noticed.. the broth was way too salty!  as well, the noodles were over cooked and soggy.  it seemed as if the noodles were pre-boiled in bulk and just sat outside waiting for orders.  anyways, about 15 mins passed and i finished eating.. still wondering.. where is the gyoza order??  i asked the waitress and she didn't even remember us ordering it even tho she keyed it in.  she asked the kitchen and they said it was coming.. i told her to cancel the order because by now, there's no point in eating the gyoza when you're done your ramen.  she agreed to cancel the order and as i got the receipt, i was charged for it.  it took me awhile to get her attention about the mistake and after it was fixed. i paid and proceeded to walk out.  i wanted to be nice and i said Thank you to the staff but all i got in return was a look.  no \"your welcome\" or \"thank you for coming\".  nothing! just a quick look.  in the end, i do NOT recommend this place. the SERVICE is horrible.  the ramen needs a lot of work!   as you can see through a few of the reviews, a lot of ppl have the same negatives.  skip Kenzo and search for another place.  what Kenzo needs to do to imrpove is have a bit more courtesy and customer service and a 2nd visit would have been considered."}
{"text":"Yet  to say I tried this out of the blue one cold winters day after shopping. I loved it the service was well eventho it was busy and the portion sizes for the noodle is well worth it. I'd like to say I'm a huge fan of this place."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen is beginner level ramen.  It's what \"california rolls\" are to sushi.  If you've never had ramen in a restaurant before (as I haven't), it's a good place to start.  I can definitely now imagine the levels of complexity a ramen bowl could reach - just not so much here.  Things I liked: the service.  Such good service!!  Really 5 stars for that.  I liked my matcha smoothie, although it could have been more liquidy.  I did like the ramen, but it did have a \"one-note\" broth and the toppings weren't so insanely delicious.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but next time I want ramen, I wouldn't choose Kenzo, I would choose to go to one of the many popular joints I keep reading about."}
{"text":"This used to be the main ramen joint before the big 3 (Sansotei, Santouka, Kinton) opened up around it. Unfortunately, there's a good reason why those three have overtaken Kenzo, because they simply produce a better product when it comes to the basic ramen (tonkotsu/shio/shoyu).  If you're coming to Kenzo, it's because you want the King of Kings ramen, or it's because you want to save money. The main selling point of Kenzo is that it is cheaper than the big 3, even cheaper than Sansotei. The basic ramen comes in at a mere $6.95, and the King of Kings ramen is $11.95. But you pay for what you get.  The problem with Kenzo is that everything is a little underseasoned. You will get a nice portion of meat, but it's just the meat and nothing else. The broth is acceptable but still a little bland. The King of Kings ramen is their finest dish because the added spiciness does give a bit of kick.  Overall, it's not offensive, but with five other ramen joints in the area (Sansotei/Santouka/Kinton/Ryu's/Raijin) Kenzo is outclassed."}
{"text":"Being in the Peel Region, this is possibly one of the only Ramen dedicated shops in the area. With that being said, I have always been a Pho guy, but being introduced to Ramen at this shop really gave me a big surprise!  Just to note again, I am no Ramen connoisseur, but god damn this place is really good! I like whats I like. It all seriousness though I have been here a couple of times after being introduced and I absolutely love it.  The couple of times I have been here, I have mainly been getting the Netsu Ramen which is $9.95. I really like this Ramen because it has a spicy broth (which isn't too spicy to me but just gives a tickle on my tongue) which comes with your choice of ground pork/chicken and stir fry vegetables. I really love the combination that the stir fry vegetables bring because it brings a level of freshness with every hearty bite you get with this bowl. Also the fact that the ramen noodles themselves are housemade and made really well in my opinion  I have also tried a couple of their other menu items other than Ramen. I would really recommend the Takoyaki which is basically grilled octopus in a ball batter, its hella good.   I would also recommend their Onigiri since they are about $3 and come in Salmon, Tuna and Chicken. Don't get me wrong when I first had it, I honestly thought to myself that I could make this at home on my own, but at the same time I low key really liked it. I actually really liked it when I was told to use some soy sauce with it, and honestly I would recommend doing that as well with the Onigiri. Onigiri + Soy Sauce = Da Bomb  Overall, This place has brought a new love to me regarding Ramen, its the Japanese signature in their soups, and really necessary for the coming cold days"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian ramen in Toronto! Great service and the Sapporo Miso is absolutely delicious! Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Really tasty Tonkatsu broth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the pork wasn't too fatty. Gyoza were very large and the filling was delicious. I don't hear a lot of love overall for Kenzo, but I think they're one of the better ramen places in the city. That's fine with me because I can have a table without waiting for half an hour in a cramped room or freezing my ass off outside.  The decor in this location is very sparse and I think they might benefit from something on the walls, but the service was better than the Bloor St. Location.  Solid Ramen."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a bowl of vegetarian ramen here tonight. When I asked for added tofu they topped it with lovely fresh thin slices. The veggies were crisp, the broth just salty enough, and the noodles soft, thin, and cooked just right. The staff were super nice, too - I suspect they stayed open a bit later on the holiday to feed me. I was pretty famished and found the portion size was just enough to stuff me silly. I'd be back, and bring reinforcements."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen is a great soup place. When I've had too much Pho, Kenzo is a great place to find an alternative to my staple soup eating patterns.  I particularly love their big monster Ramen soup which I, unfortunately, can't remember the name. It's a huge bowl of mixed ingredients which is a great way to please my complexity loving pallet.   Their food is very good, their prices are reasonable, and I've never had an issue with their service which is always prompt and polite.   Although some say that you should never go to a soup place on a date, I would argue that Kenzo is a great option for such an occasion. :)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Ordered the yakisoba and takoyaki. Yakisoba was decent. Takoyaki was also decent--decent size of tako inside, but I'm not sure if the dough was slightly underdone. But 10 bucks for 1 order of takoyaki is a bit expensive (5 bucks at other places, 7 at most?)  Quality: 7/10. Value: 5.5/10. Service: 7.5/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"unfortunately nothing special. was a tad disappointed in the kinda bland bowl of ramen. Was very disappointed when I found a white piece of plastic in the bowl. Im pretty sure I won't be back yet the service was crazy fast. I love that in and out kinda meal sometimes"}
{"text":"Not an expert on this kind of food-- but this was delicious . Excellent Miso soups among other dishes. We were the only Caucasians in the place, which is almost always a good sign for  a Japanese restaurant . Gyozo were excellent."}
{"text":"Forget this one... head straight across the street to Sansotei Ramen! I knew something was wrong as the place was almost empty while its packed at Sansotei! This was around 6pm on a weekday. Menu came and I noticed that everything has gone up by $2 from the photos posted here on yelp. The Tonkatsu ramen is now $13 and not $11. Guess inflation caught up by 20%! Ramen was rather soft and not \"el dente\". The pork slices were rather small and as someone else mentioned, it only came with 1/2 a slice of egg.  Come on... egg aint that expensive. $2 increase and less of the good stuffs.... enuff said...."}
{"text":"MSG filled ramen. Not the place to go for ramen."}
{"text":"I loved itttttt!! went with my boyfriend, I got the king of kings & he got tan tan man. Both had a totally different taste but was amazing. I got spice level 1 and it was a bit too spicy for me but I still loved it.  The servers were so prompt and polite & the atmosphere was great. when we left there was a line at the door. Highly highly reccomend !"}
{"text":"Kenzo is like that person you feel a bit sorry for because they just seem to be forgotten / lost in the crowd. The taste is average but it's a convenient choice if Sansotei across the street has a huge line, or you have a vegetarian friend. I would pick Kenzo any day over Ajisen, but ultimately head down the street to Santouka for a better meal.  Pros: -lots of noodles (probably double the standard at Kinton / Sansotei) -quick service -good vegetarian options. Most soup bases at the authentic places are pork-based  Cons: -lack of depth of flavours / heartiness in the soup base -price is the same as authentic places"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and both times the service is moderately lacking. A lady came to refill the water to the table on our left- less than 10 cm away- and completely ignored the fact that my glass is right at the edge of the table, and that it's totally empty. I asked for water again afterwards, and my request was acknowledged, but quickly forgotten. As a result, I remained thirsty for the rest of the meal. The ramen flavours are pretty good however, and the portions are definitely better than that of Sansotei's. Regardless, this place is never going to get more than a 10% tip from me."}
{"text":"Takoyaki is amazinggg, I always come back craving for it. King of kings is probs the best ramen there. Still itching to try out their I onigiri gyoudon and tofu!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after reading the reviews. Don't expect service from this place. I can say that it is non-existence. The food are good. Maybe real ramen noodle (itself) is not my type of thing. I prefer the one from Su Shi much more. But the taste of all ingredients are well done. I also liked eating the balls from the picture that they have there."}
{"text":"Walked in on a cold January night and decided to have a gourmet meal for one. Upon entering, the staff greeted me and told me to seat myself. They brought over the menu along with a glass of water. I saw that they do this for every customer that walks in. I usually get the Netsu Ramen and usually go to the Dundas or Bloor location but since I was on Queen, I decided to try something else. The Orochong Ramen.... holy shit. Holy. Shit. This dish is a world of its own. Not too sure about the other locations but I could tell they make their own noodles from scratch and the picture on the menu DOES NOT do this dish justice.   It's perfectly warm, oily and spicy. One wrong slurp and yea, you may or may not choke on the oil but that's all part of the fun. They're quite generous with their veggies and I was told to try the chicken version. They clearly did something to the chicken, cuz first bite, damn. I was sold. I just kept silently nodding my head with a stupid grin on my face.  I kept seeing other customers order dumplings and I do love dumplings so I ordered their 3 pieces to take home. When I got home, they were still warm and was surprised as to how big they were. I mean they were huge for the price they were charging. Again, their generosity in portioning has been well noted! I'm reading the other reviews below and I see that their dumplings are made at home. Dang. Don't know if it's the MRS or the MR who makes dumplings but they are so rich and so flavorful. It was slightly spicy but I mean that's what helps cut the grease I suppose.   Overall, my experience as a lonely diner was great. I was also happy that I wasn't the only one sitting alone with headphones in and just lost in their phones. I will definitely be coming back to Kenzo on Queen street time and time again!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing this place for a while now and finally made it in to have lunch.   Great little place to grab a quick bite and boy does it get busy!! I came in around noon and was greeted and seated immediately.   I started with an order of onigiri and it was great! Thoroughly enjoyed as a starter.   I kept it simple for my choice of ramen and ordered the sho-yu ramen. The broth was very tasty and had the perfect amount of fixings on top. The size of the small bowl was quite generous and perfect for me. There was bok choy as a topping which I'm not used to on ramen but it was enjoyable. Noodles were perfect and I will def be back.   The reason for the missing star was the service as I waited quite a while for my bill. It was busy with a small line up and I thought they would be eager to use the table but I waited about 10 minutes before I had to flag someone down for the bill."}
{"text":"AMAZING RAMEN! Me and my friends keep on going back to this place and we don't mind the huge line up, because it is worth the wait - EVEN DURING WINTER TIME! I even brought my mom here once, and she was so impressed.   The price is okay;  Servers are friendly; Good ambience - definitely feels like your in a ramen place; and WORTH-THE-WAIT RAMEN.    Hopefully, the owner would expand the place to accomodate more people"}
{"text":"I love ramen but this place just doesn't cut it.  I got the basic miso ramen and it was very underwhelming.  The broth did not taste right and the noodles were kind of soggy.   There was way too much bean sprouts in the noodles and the amount of meat was not comparable to the picture on the menu.  I probably would not come back, I rather drive downtown for the better ramen places that never disappointed me.  The reason why this place gets a two star from me is because the service was okay and was pretty quick."}
{"text":"KENZO mmm mmm good.   I cannot claim that i have a refined palette for determining what good Ramen is due to the fact i have never been to Japan.  Nor will i make judgements on Korean owned restaurants creating Japanese dishes especially since Japan occupied Korea for 35 years and from what i know the origins of Ramen are Chinese.  Kenzo is a Lil hole in the wall the service is generally fast but not always timed well,  for example your guest may get their soup before you do.  I never care cuz the food is mouth watering.  I always order soup and an app. takoyaki or gyoza both are good.  my top 3 fave soups are  The King of Kings Ramen has all the accompaniments of a Ramen soup... full of spicy smoky flavour   Sho-yu Ramen is delicate and perfect for a hangover.  Tonkatsu- pork bone broth yummers  I love KENZO"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of ramen places in Toronto ranging from spaghetti at Ajisen Ramen in North York to almost Japan decent at Kinton.  This place is a bit more authentic, but oddly the noodles tasted like Chinese Chow Mein.  I ordered the King dish which I thought was a heafty meaty plate and wasn't as spicy as advertised.  It didn't really taste that great, sort of too much vegetable to noodle meat ratio.  Shame."}
{"text":"I ordered Ramen from the menu picture. But when it comes , it looks different. I thought something wrong, so I asked them\" I think I didn't order this( I saw the picture on menu). On the menu, it comes with 3 eggs, 3 pork meats. And no seaweed, katsuo.\"  And the staff told me\" that's what you ordered, sometimes the picture is not the same.\"  His mean is on the picture 3 eggs, 3 pork meats. But you'll get only 1 egg and 2 pork meats.   I know the real always look more ugly than but i don't care about that. Now I know more thing is the real have less everything than on the menu. The menu is just look for fun. What they wanna served to you is their business."}
{"text":"I love soups and sometimes ignorance can truly be bliss.   I know my way around Pho's and Pork Bone soups, however Ramen, I can't say much except that I enjoy them. As such, I do happen to like Kenzo.   Both times I have been there, the new location has been mostly empty --including dinner time here, so I would take most people don't know about this location yet, even though it is listed on their website.     The first time I was there I had a Netsu Ramen which --with limited experience found to be very tasty. The second time I had their Orochong ('cause youth love it ;-) ...which I found good but I actually preferred their Netsu better. Mind you that is a matter of taste, not quality.   On a positive note, the waiter came after our meal and asked what we thought of it. If perhaps it was too salty or if there was anything they could do to improve the dish.... WHAT? Really? For better or worse, I cannot even remember when was the last time I was asked that in a restaurant. It was appreciated, however due to my lack of Ramen experience, I really could not give any meaningful feedback.   As far as quality, I could not how \"authentic\" it was. I could only assume that it is not. But unlike places like Pho88, where their pho is neither authentic or that well made, this simile of Ramen was quite delicious given it's lack of authenticness.   If you have never been to Japan then I very much recommend this place. However if you HAVE been to Japan, chances are that you know better and probably just come her because the selection in Canada is so slim.   Having said that, I will keep an eye for other Ramen places to expand my palette. However next time I go back, I will have check out the King Ramen."}
{"text":"Don't know why I've never written a review for Kenzo yet considering I've come here a handful of times since its grand opening in Mississauga over a year ago..Pros: TONKATSU RAMEN (I like my salt) so beware if you don't. Cons: Service is slow, and the decor is far from great."}
{"text":"Walking down dundas feeling some ramen cause it was snowing in april, and saw a small line in front of sansotei. But I didn't feel like standing in line in the cold so walked over to kenzo.  Ordered the King of Kings ramen which came in at $15. The bowl came with really thin noodles, thick pieces of pork (as opposed to super thin slices of pork belly), a bunch of shredded green onions, carrots, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts, and two half eggs. Honestly, eating the noodles reminds me of the wonton noodle soup I would get at cantonese restaurants in chinatown. I would prefer thicker chewier noodles that most ramen places use.  Portion sizes are definitely larger than other ramen shops. I think I've always been pretty biased against kenzo because their choice of ingredients compared to other popular ramen shops around the city are pretty different. I mean, it's still \"ramen\" I guess by definition, and kenzo markets these bowls as an \"original\" take on japanese ramen.  As far as a bowl of noodle soup, it was enjoyable. Flavor was average, but portions I suppose make up for it. The soup reminded me of the kind of soup I would get at a korean restaurant.  Definitely less waiting here compared to other japanese ramen places."}
{"text":"Good, not great, ramen.  Tonkotsu ramen is one of their specialties.  Orochong or hot Netsu ramen has a  slight hint of spiciness, I guess that's \"hot\" for Japanese cuisine.  Broth has some depth, I wasn't overly thirsty after the meal, so I think they go light on MSG.    Service is hurried, although not rude.  All energy is reserved for getting you in and out as quickly as possible; not interested in chatting with you or encouraging you to linger on.    If I'm in the area again and looking for a quick fulfilling bowl of noodles, I wouldn't hesitate coming here."}
{"text":"Went to Canada Computers and saw this place. Popped in and tried the octopus balls. I was pleasantly surprised, they were delicious! Will go again probably this week to try noodles."}
{"text":"Not bad, comfortable enough seating and the ramen was tasty. It also came out super fast. I'm no ramen afficionado by any stretch, but I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Fast and good service. The ramen and gyoza was really good. Tried the king of kings and nagasaki champion. The spice was right. Definitely reccomend."}
{"text":"First time trying it out as we've been hearing rave reviews from family members and we were not disappointed!  Ordered The King of Kings Ramen all around and we were just busy splurging away.  Portion size is huge - brimming with a filling serving of ramen noodles and loaded with toppings.  It really is a stretch to finish and such a great value.  Would definitely return to try out the variety of ramen bowls."}
{"text":"I ordered king of king ramen it was average. I liked the black tonkatsu better. The bill was $15 plus tax and 15% gratuity (part of the bill).  I don't think it should have been added as part of the bill as I was there by myself, it is understandable for a big group. Also, I don't like to tip over tax and when I calculated to final price, it was indeed 15% on the HST too. This was my second time here and I don't remember they adding the gratuity part of the bill.  I didn't want to create a scene there so did not ask them to correct it."}
{"text":"It's probably racist of me, but I have laxer standards on service with asian restaurants. Cash only? That's pretty standard. Brusque-- and slow!-- service? Comes with the territory, guys. Service here wasn't all that worse than many asian restaurants I've visited-- with the exception of their failure to pack my meal and serve us *all* water (I can usually expect this much from even the worst restaurants. Maybe our waitress couldn't count?)  However, despite this, I may have tougher standards on the food: the soup in my Ji Su Ramen a bit flavourless, the noodles machine-cut and bland, and the toppings a touch too sparse. I've had better ramen in Vancouver and New York. If my standard for asian food is MSG-chocked but flavourful, I think I'd rather take my chances with the MSG than come here."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramien. Way better than the stuff you get in packages at the grocery stores. I would come here again just for the food. The wait staff seemed frazzled and overwhelmed with the number of customers in the restaurant and the ones waiting in line. I saw one waiter asking if they asked for the bill and they actually ran out of the wonton dish my wife ordered. I got the King of Kings and was very yummy.  Go for the food - but be willing to be patient with the wait staff."}
{"text":"This is the go-to (the only) place for Japanese ramen in Mississauga. If you don't come early, expect yourself to write your name down on the list and wait. This Friday I came around 8:40 and didn't get a table till 9:30. Normally the line moves pretty fast but this time it was a bit crazy. Considering they close at 10, people were still coming to try to get a spot to eat - even at exactly 10, we saw a couple finally get seated at a table.   My usuals are the King of Kings, Tonkotsu, Black Tonkotsu, and either gyoza or takoyaki as an appetizer. SO GOOD!   They really should consider opening another, BIGGER, location and stay open later.   Side note: after ramen we like to get Chatime since it's right next door and we find that's what everyone else does too!"}
{"text":"Their spicy charsu broth is plain and not as flavourful compare to the Mississauga branch that I normally go too."}
{"text":"I enjoy the most is their spicy Charsu noodles soup. My only critics is they always give too little soup broth. They always raise up their price for this pacific dish. This is the most expensive dish compare to others noodles soup.."}
{"text":"First thing you have to do here is to put your name on the waiting list. If people weren't doing it, I wouldn't have known. The wait was decent, and the service was lightning fast, I loved it. The only thing is that the ramen I ordered was sooo large. I had no idea it was so big, so my brother ate the rest. The noodles were chewy at first and the soup was sublime. The spices built in time because it started to get super spicy afterwards. You'll need more than one cup of water. I'm not a big soup person so I'd probably just come back for the noodles on the hot plate or the chicken katsu."}
{"text":"It was a bit expensive, but it is a really good soup. Definitely a lot better than anything at pacific mall. There are vegetarian options so yay!. I'm vegan so they were kind enough to remove the noodles and substitute with more bean sprouts and rice on the side."}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes, food is still not here. People next to us came in 5 minutes after us and they are finished with their dinner already eating their last dumpling while we are still patiently waiting. Finally called the waitress over and asked where our food are. Ignored us and went on with her life realizing she forgot to take our order. This is unacceptable. Won't recommend anyone to come here. Food is salty. Just like their employees!"}
{"text":"There was a time where I absolutely loved Kenzo as it was the only ramen choice in downtown..... Now that kinton and sansotei and others will be in town, the bar is a bit higher and....meh, Kenzo's alright. Too skimpy on the pork, but the rest of the toppings are tasty. Would eat there when I'm lazy since I live nearby but would rather trek to Kinton on a nice day."}
{"text":"The idea of ramen in Japan is an inexpensive way to fill up/warm up the average person on the go.   This place however can tend to be full capacity at times with very long lineups. Seating is limited because it's a small location.   Firstly I want to point out that I am fairly pleased with their menu in terms of portion size and variety. They range from basic miso broths, to pork bone broths, to spicy ones. The miso broth I feel lacks in flavour but that's fixed with the Japanese pepper flake seasoning they sometimes provide so make sure to ask for it if they don't provide it.   I do have a major problem with certain things however. The 1st thing is the seating. The chairs look like they were made in an elementary class. It is literally a board of wood with four legs (very uncomfortable). They may be going for a Japanese ambiance, but we're in Canada and I expect more comfortable seating whilst I enjoy a meal.  2nd is the waiting area. They pack two benches into an already tightly packed entrance so you're actually elbowing your way through people just to take your seat.  3rd is the actual space of the dining area; it's small, and for the hype that this restaurant has they'd relocate to a larger location. They would easily accommodate other hungry patrons instead of having them wait for upwards of 30 minutes on certain busy nights. Ramen will always be popular so filling more tables in a bigger restaurant won't hurt the business. That's what separates themselves from being a 5 star experience in my mind.   I live in Mississauga and sometimes need my ramen fix, and they're the only ones around, so for that they currently win, and their food is decently priced and tastes great with good portions so I'll be going back.. However as a restaurant that offers a certain culinary demand from people I'm sure other shops are soon to follow in their footsteps and ramen will be booming in Mississauga, and hopefully Kenzo make sure their problems are addressed if they want to stay afloat."}
{"text":"One of the best ramens I've had. Didn't come here having high expectations given it's Mississauga but I was quite satisfied. Broth was just right (not too salty) and very flavourful. Ratio of toppings to noodles was just right - usually other places over-index on noodles and broth. The pork slices were extremely tender to my surprise. The stir fry vegetables in my \"kings of king ramen\" had a good pan-fry taste. Portion was big. Noodles are made from scratch and we're fresh and soft.   We also ordered octopus balls as an appetizer. It was soft and yummy but mainly dough- very small piece of octopus inside.   Just be prepared to wait in line! We waited for an hour - arrived on a Friday at 7pm and got seated at 8pm. Leave a Facebook post and they'll give you a small gift (phone stand and grip)."}
{"text":"My party of 2 went on a Saturday around 12pm and the wait was not terrible. Once we were seated, the line started forming so we were quite glad to have gotten there earlier! Their queue system is different compared to most restaurants where you have to write your name down on a sheet of paper next to the front entrance. They call your name and your party based on the tables that free up... really based on an honour system!  We ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and the Spicy Noodle Challenge noodles (level 1). I don't tolerate spice well and I found the spicy noodles WAY too spicy. The Tonkatsu was light and not overly oily. The pork was quite tender, however my soft boiled egg was definitely overcooked. I also wish that they gave me a full egg instead of just half!  Overall, averagely priced and averagely tasting."}
{"text":"I've been to two other Kenzo locations and the menu and food is consistent.  Finally a location in Missisaauga!  Busy on a Wednesday night as we got a table for two.   Steady stream of people coming and going.  Ordered Takoyaki, Nagasaki Champon, and tonkatsu ramen.  The Takoyaki was fresh and delicious fluffy balls of octopus goodness.  The ramen is great.  The Nagasaki Champon came with a generous portion of mussels, shrimp, squid, and scallops all seared, cooked perfectly.  Service took awhile to get them to come take your order.  If you're impatient you can flag them down and they will come over.  Food takes awhile but it's freshly made and worth the wait.  The only issue is that the music is too loud and you can't have a conversation without yelling....   Still plan to come back when I'm in the mood for ramen...."}
{"text":"Some of my favorites are Ju sa men, takoyaki or squid balls and gyoza. Employees are very friendly. They greet you when you enter or leave the place. The place is clean. Sometimes there is waiting time  (5 to 15 mins). Highly recommended specially on cold days."}
{"text":"This place is always so busy! The first time I came here, the place has just opened up and it was super packed. A year later, I came again...and it's the same! Super busy.   The thing about ramen places is that they have to be really good. If they aren't, you really don't get your money's worth.   I came here again recently and the experience was okay. The ramen that I ordered tasted okay. The broth was a little salty, noodles weren't thst great and there wasn't enough meat which was really disappointing.   Portions were okay. Price could be lower...just because it wasn't at all great. They should focus more on the quality of food.  In terms of service, as it is very busy, they don't attend to your needs at all (if you want another glass of water, good luck getting a server). You also enough up going to the front counter to pay...if you just sit there and wait for the bill, it's never going to come to you.  I think this is the first ramen place in Mississauga that's qhy everyone comes here. It's so overrated for something that's really basic."}
{"text":"As many have said, the ramen here is good although far from authentic. I lived in Tokyo for many years and within that time I had a lot of ramen of varying quality. Kenzo wasn't bad all things considered and what I ordered there would rate 3 stars in Tokyo and possibly 4 stars in Toronto based on the lack of good ramen. However Kenzo loses points for the total lack of service.   The table I had been seated at had not been wiped down after the previous customer had left. There was no greeting or preamble from the server, he just took my order. While my ramen and gyoza arrived reasonably quickly, at no time did the server check on my order once it had been served.  The noodles were slightly chewy yet still firm, the soup wasn't too salty but could have used some garlic to cut through the fat and the char-siu was tender and juicy. The gyoza were nice and crispy on the bottom but the sauce served with them was strangely sweet. It could have benefited from some hot chili oil. Overall the food was good.  Once finished, I waited patiently for 10 minutes for the server to remove my dishes and offer anything else. At no point did either arrive even though he cleared the dishes from the table next to mine and gave them their bill when I had obviously finished my meal. It wasn't as if he was busy or anything as there was maybe only 2-3 other tables there.  I will be willing to go back there in future as it's the only place in this city where I can get some decent tonkotsu ramen when the next craving hits."}
{"text":"Rating has gone down to 2 stars.  I love the food here but man...someone needs to do something about the service and the outdated menu.   I ordered the Katsu Kare - which is fully indicated on their menu. A couple of minutes later the server came up to me and wanted to clarify if I wanted the Katsudon. I told her no, I wanted the Katsu Kare. She looked at me like I was crazy and hands me the menu again and tells me there is no such thing.   I looked over the menu and noticed it wasn't there. I told her she must've given me a different menu. She tells me it is the only menu they have and I probably wanted the Katsudon.  Again, I told her no, it wasn't what I wanted and went to look for the menu she gave me initially.  Once I found it, I showed her the Katsu Kare is on the menu. She then apologizes and tells me they don't have curry and asks if I want to order something else instead.  UGHHHH do I have a choice?! This was so frustrating. Especially, when you have to wait 20-30 minutes to get a table and you're hungry as f. And when you finally sit down to order they say they don't have what's on their menu.  How does that make any sense?!  Kenzo you need to: 1. change to a bigger location to accommodate people 2. update your menu  3. improve your customer service   I don't think I can come back here. Saves me the hassle."}
{"text":"Salty, strong flavor was my first impression. I am a vegetarian hence there are only 3 options open to me. I ordered the Saporo miso ramen, it was ok, nothing special (for $11 it should be more special, no?) But from the taste, I think the soup base isn't vegetarian, it must have some pork extract or meat powder flavoring in it. Tea is $1.00 (not free which is stupid), and my 'free' water is only half full. This is a somewhat disappointing experience, and because I feel odd about the soup ingredient I most likely won't go back again. Oh ya, I smell like the restaurant after too, and got really hungry 2.5 hrs later. Lol."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Very tasty and flavourful! I ordered the noodles and they were perfectly made. I would would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hit the spot for a chill easy dinner. The noodles and soup are super good. One thing I would say is that there was no enough meat in the noodles - only two pieces made me wanting more! And the prices are also very good for the portion they offer. Very good place for a simple, filling and savory dinner."}
{"text":"To the folks in Mississauga, this is the best ramen you can find in the city for now anyway. I'm so glad a decent ramen place finally opened here. We used to have to go to Toronto for ramen. This Kenzo ramen branch just opened and it is already packed with patrons.   The place is not large so it can get full pretty quickly. The service is fast and efficient so the wait so far isn't that long.   I ordered the Tonkotsu miso ramen. It is saltier than their Tonkotsu ramen probably because of the miso. I liked the dish but I'll probably go with the one without miso next time. Since they just opened, the appetizers are not available yet. My husband was a little disappointed he couldn't order the Takoyaki (baked octopus ball).   This is a decent ramen place and we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've knocked one star purely because of the service being extremely slow. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and we ordered takoyaki as an app. We had a decent wait for our ramen which was fine however we were starving and when we finally did receive it - OMG it was delicious! Salty but delicious. The noodles were perfectly Al dente, the char siu was perfectly melt in your mouth and tender! The Bok Choy was ok - not a fan of that veg but meh it was a crunch. The egg was a little too over done for me - I was hoping for an ooey gooey yolk.   My issue with my trip there was receiving the takoyaki 10 minutes after we finished our entrees. I noticed when leaving they only had one pan that would make 3 orders - I think especially since almost every table ordered it - they should consider having more than one takoyaki pan??   Also noticed that the broths are made on site - the flavourings for each broth are in a packet and I would assume their own plain broth was added to it in the small pots they have going on the stove. If you know anything about tonkotsu and how the broth is made - you would know like I did upon receiving mine - the broth hadn't been homemade.   I'd go back in a heart beat however - because all in all - it's delicious and most people can appreciate good quick to eat food."}
{"text":"All i can say is Wow ! I'm impressed.  I haven't been to this location for a while and they really got their act together. When i first came here when they first opened, they didn't have AC and their soup tasted a bit burnt. It has improved since then, hence the large crowd now.  Man i felt like i got teased today.  I got the spicy one and the wife got the creamy vegetarian. Boy was mine spicy but tasted sooo good. I do wish it had a little more noodles in it though.  Food 5/5 Convenience 5/5 - right beside chatime :) Service 5/5 Price 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I love Kenzo!    I was surprised to read all the bad posts!  People that I bring there love it as well, but apparently, I am not the ramen connoisseur!  (But I thought I was!)  I'm from Vancouver and I thought the Ramen is comparable!  I have tried every ramen in the house, some are blander, but I think the ultimate 2 for adventure seekers are: King of King Ramen (spicy) and the JiSuMen (sesame).  My co workers and I come here frequently and it's our tops!  Addressing the service: hahah reading some it is funny.  I had HORRIBLE service when I went today but normally, (since we are repeat customers) there is this one young fella who is the bomb!!  (He usually wears a baseball cap and he's kinda cute!)   What people have to know, is that in most small asian joints, this is what the service is like!  Straight up and to the point, with a side of, \"oops I forgot\"  For the ramen experience, I think this is as good as it gets.  Apparently, there is a place on Baldwin that is awesome, I have still yet to try.  But come on, for Ramen in Toronto, I say go for it!"}
{"text":"Ordered it through a delivery app. It wasn't very fresh. Like as if the ingredients had been sitting there for a while. The Bok choy was all withered. And the ramen broth was kinda lacking in flavor compared to some of the other places I've tried. Not terrible though so that's why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"My hubby and I trekked here from Scarborough.  We are both hard core ramen lovers having eaten in the ramen holes in NYC, Tokyo, and the Mitsuwas in NJ and Chicago.  This place is just as good as the Mitsuwas!  Since this was our first time here, we went for the basics...I had the shoyu and hubby had the miso.  We split an order of gyoza.  The gyoza was 7.95 which we thought was pricey, but they were bigger than normal and could almost serve as a meal by itself.   They were fresh, plump, crisp and juicy!  The ramen was pretty good too - I would have liked there to be more soup in the bowl, but oh well.   The noodles were cooked to perfection, the base was pretty good and the pork was tender.   Very yummy and satisfying when the temperature outside was sub zero.  The place was crowded and by the time we left, there was a line of people waiting for tables.  When the door opened a huge draft  would let the cold air in....BRRRrr... But the shivers go away once you start slurping the noodles!  Service was quick and the servers greet you once you come in...very Japanese style of serving (polite, quick, and they help you when you need it, but pretty much leave you alone while you dine)."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Ramen place forever and the staff forgot about me and didn't put my order in. Was there for 45min before I figured it out and had to go so haven't had a chance to try the food yet. Can't tell you how disappointed I was"}
{"text":"Broth was overly salty without true taste of broth, noodles were overcooked with weird uneven consistency.   They gave me raw gyoza then instead of fixing as I reported it, the waitress proceeded to waste my time to inform how I Might be wrong (how the parboiled then grilled), how about check the meat when I point at it instead of running your mouth? It took the full meal until the gyoza was returned to the table. When it was brought back,  instead of giving me a new order they just gave the exact plate with a pcs I spat out. Its all soggy bc I suspect they just microwaved it. Wtf, so not coming back  Waste of money and of time."}
{"text":"Quick Service, Ordered Tan-Tan Men, and Miso Ramen. Both were absolutely fantastic. Fresh, made from scratch. Definitely going back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously on a Wednesday night and was very impressed with the food and service. I was surprised that the restaurant was really busy, we waited about 30 minutes for a table.  I got the Spicy Charsu Ramen at level 2 spice ($11.95). It was delicious and not too spicy. I loved the charsu, very flavourful. I would definitely get this again. We also got the Takoyaki ($9.95) which was perfect to share between two people. It was good but not amazing. Satisfies the craving.  The thing that stood out the most to me during this visit was the service. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. She noticed that we had a wobbly table and fixed it with a napkin without us asking. I was really impressed! Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I remember eating Kenzo years ago when they first came to Toronto and it was yum! Just had it as a quick eat and it was not good - nope nope. The pork was dry and completely flavourless, the soup had no distinct flavour as well, and the noodles tasted cheaper than noodles you get at a cheap fast food Asian restaurant in a food court. Not worth."}
{"text":"Decent ramen although cannot compare to Sansotei. Its cheaper and good for lunch, noodles and broth are only average. I did really like their onigiri but they're really small."}
{"text":"Based on my research, this is the best and really only, ramen place in Mississauga so I came here to satisfy my ramen craving.  The food and service were both quite good. They also have handmade gyoza which was good.  I tried the miso ramen and the soup was pretty heavy but tasty.    The service was great, and I went on a weekday afternoon at 2pm so it wasn't packed.  The food came pretty fas"}
{"text":"The black tonkotsu wasn't bad. Definitely not amazing in anyway, but being the only ramen house in sauga can't complain. Should definitely order the gyzoa, they was delicious. Everything we ordered tasted fresh and made from scratch. You can see the whole kitchen from the seating area. Place is kinda small for a sauga location.....Strange. They don't take reso, so when you get there you need to sign in immediately to get called for a table. Thank goodness the wait for ramen doesn't take that long :)"}
{"text":"Kenzo's new location on Dundas has been receiving much press lately as Toronto foodies are catching up on the ramen craze.  What a better to while away the fall (and winter) cold with a nice big bowl of noodle soup.    My first attempt at going to Kenzo was unsuccessful since it was a quick lunchtime run and the long queue outside the door was a discouragement for my hour break.  Second and third times there met with much better luck.   The ramen is delicious with just enough bite.  The broth is suitably salty, and the toppings fresh and cleanly presented.   I also had a side of gyoza which were outstanding.  They were some the fattest, juiciest, meatiest gyoza i have had in a long time.  Slightly crispy on the bottom, not greasy at all with the filling tasty of leeks and pork.  YUM!!!  I didn't have as horrible service as it seems most of reviewers here had.  It was quick and efficient if not overly friendly.  (Nothing beyond expectations for a noodle house, really)"}
{"text":"A perfect spot for a quick lunch! It gets really busy at lunch time so be there a few minutes before noon, especially during winter time if you don't want to wait outside in the cold.  Donkatsu ramen is my fav as it has rich, delicious broth. I always ask for extra minced garlic to make the soup more garlicy!"}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Ramen topped with sliced roast pork, half soft boiled egg, bean sprouts and baby bok choy in pork bone broth was $10.95. The broth was delicate and not too salty. The noodles had a good chew to them. The star, however, was the roasted pork which was packed with flavour. Wish there was more.  One of my guest had the Netsu Ra-men and she had said the broth had no flavour.  One of the staff took it back and brought out a new one which was much better.  My other guest had the Ji Su Men was tasty and as expected.  The Takoyaki (Octopus Balls, $9.95) tasted like... bananas with tonakatsu sauce. It wasn't my cup of tea of tea but not I could see how some may enjoy its soft, gooey  texture and the sweet banana flavour.  Service was quick and food came out fast.  The ingredients were quality.  The seasoning could use just a little work.  The price was reasonable in relation to the quantities served."}
{"text":"2.5  Service completely lacking. ..it looked like a hang put friends than a professional restaurant.    Appetizers came as deserts...6 fried dumplings that were more soggy than crispy. The meat inside was not bad but to come at the end of the meal seemed unorganized as the entire experience.  Ramen was typical... the meat undersized and over cooked.   The bill came promptly....probably skip this and walk a bit further down the road."}
{"text":"Finally a decent ramen place in Mississauga. Note it's not excellent, only decent.  Three of us visited this place last Saturday afternoon. We each ordered separate bowls: - tonkotsu miso ramen - tonkotsu ramen - king of kings ramen (medium spiciness)   Both tonkotsu ramens were alright in terms of noodles. Broth was a bit too salty. King of kings ramen was the tastiest out of the three choices, with lots of toppings and most flavourful. There were three levels of spiciness to choose from. I've picked the \"two peppers\" (medium spicy) and I could definitely feel the heat which was enough to make me sweat. The king of kings bowl was large for ladies but the other two were small. Overall it was a bit more expensive than other ramen places in downtown Toronto.  For service and decor, I would only give 2 stars: 1) In terms of decor, there was nothing to write about. Almost food court like tables and chairs. 2) Line ups were long even at 2pm. There was a \"self-serve\" sign in sheet posted on the wall beside the door. Customers need to write their names and number of people themselves on the sheet when they get there otherwise they would not be placed in sequence. Thank my previous group in line mentioning this to me, or else I would not know.  3) The wait staffs placed customers in random tables. For example, a group of two would be placed in a four-person table rather than asking a a group of four next in line to sit there. I was asked to sit in a two-person table even though we were a party of three! When I chose not to sit at that tiny table, the wait staff replied in a rather impolite tone to me that I needed to wait longer. It's fine with me waiting longer, but I didn't appreciate that attitude. 4) Air conditioning was barely functioning. It's probably due to the fact that it was an open kitchen. May be they should invest in a few more fans.  It's a good start that ramen joints finally come to Mississauga. I certainly hope Kenzo will improve so I can get my ramen fix without driving far."}
{"text":"Really nice and filling for a late night dinner.  Flavors are good and it's a meal on the unique side.  By the way, you really can only get noodles here.  Also, not sure why the beer was so expensive."}
{"text":"I've been to the ones in Toronto and I really feel like this one is the best ! The noodles are fresh and the portions are really fair ! I've been back here more than any other ramen places I've been to. However, I wish they would grant their student discount through interac not only cash."}
{"text":"Great service. Always busy but they package to go orders well and their customer service is great! Sapporo Miso is delicious!"}
{"text":"Lots of flavour, the freshness can tasted, and very quick and pleasant staff. Alot of the places on young around this area are still hit and miss, but this is a sure keeper if they keep the quality up and the prices under $12. Only thing I missed was some free kimtchi to calm the hunger during the wait."}
{"text":"Ramen is always a must in almost every city I visit. This one caught my eye as I was dashing to the Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Cheesecake bakery.   The prices are decent, especially when converted to USD.   I ordered the Netsu Ramen with chicken. When I ordered it, the server offered to have them make the broth spicier, which was awesome, although I do wish they did have extra chili on the side to make it spicier! It had mushrooms, which I thought was odd. They provide a generous portion for ramen, however, there isn't a lot of meat included with the bowl. It was definitely not the best ramen I've eaten though due to the lack of spices and meat.   My friend ordered the Yakisoba. I can't necessarily speak to this, but she did say it was good.   I would definitely recommend this place though, as it is worth trying. They also accept credit cards, which is also a major plus."}
{"text":"Kenzo is a Japanese noodle house located conveniently around the corner of Yonge and Dundas square. The restaurant's main focus is ramen, however appetizers like tofu, gyoza (japanese dumplings), and chicken karaage (deep fried chicken) are available as well.  Food: 2.5/5 Ordered the Shi-o Ramen and Shoyu Ramen - toppings included are nori, green onion, naruto, and two pieces of roasted pork and marinated bamboo shoots (seasonal toppings which they didn't have at the time). The amount of toppings felt lacking and the depth of flavour fell shallow. The texture of the pork felt a bit dry, and the noodles were nothing out of the ordinary.  If you're looking for a richer flavour, I suggest getting the tonkotsu broth ramen instead.  Decor: During busy times, this place can get uncomfortably cramped. The small space does not allow for flexible travel room and any sense of privacy between your dining partner is lost. The design of this restaurant has nothing unique.  Is it worth it? Yes, and no. This place really used to be the place to go - however, the ramen standard has risen and Kenzo just could not keep up. In my opinion, it feels as if Kenzo's standard of ramen has actually lowered. Overall, the prices are significantly lower than hyped up ramen restaurants, so it is definitely worth it if all you're looking for is a quick fix."}
{"text":"If you love Ramen, then you need to enjoy it here NOW. its wicked. been there twice already and its an hr drive from my house. My fav here \"Gyoza \" . Oh just thinking about it makes me hungry. Filled with delicious meat and seasonings. You need to try them, they are that good !!! Servers all friendly and will recommend ramen's for your taste."}
{"text":"So today I visited Kenzo  Ramen Noodle house on Dundas Street West for lunch .I enjoyed the seafood ramen noodle soup it was okay but nothing special it looked much better than it tasted. I had a level 2 spice factor, wasn't very hot at all ....maybe next time I'll try level 3. My waitresses were very friendly and very attentive. I did not like the actual restaurant itself .....it felt too small and too cluttered and I didn't like the open kitchen concept ....I don't like to see my food being prepared as it kind of grosses me out.  I definitely will be going back again I want to try some of the other soups that they have available I definitely want to try the level 3 heat factor soup that they advertise and everyone gushes about.  For my stupid one Sapparo beer my meal came up to about $22 kind of expensive for lunch especially when I'm eating by myself. So no real complaints I'll be back!"}
{"text":"# of Visits: 2 Date of last visit (before review): 12/28/2013  Disclaimer - I'm not a big fan of ramen houses in general.  I find them overpriced and don't get the entire \"fad\".  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen on my last visit. The slices of meat was tender, but I found the broth too salty.  However, I find most ramen too salty anyways, so I guess maybe I just like my food more natural and plain.  Also, overall ambiance is weird, not because of the decor, but because of the service.   I felt like I walked into a restaurant where no one really cares.  They served the food quickly, but I didn't feel welcome.  It was like walking into one of those bad bubble tea places where you have to literally wave your hand to call the server.    Verdict: Not a date place, but good if you need a ramen fix in Mississauga and don't want food court quality from Square one."}
{"text":"Just love their King of Kings so much! I've been to multiple places of Kenzo chain store, and cannot get tired of their King of Kings! The noodle was really good!"}
{"text":"Pretty excellent ramen, certainly the best in the area.  This place just opened, but you wouldn't know it. The service is prompt, the menu is strong and simple, the food is fresh and well balanced with no sign of growing pains. It helps that this is an expansion of their Dundas Street location, but even still I'm quite impressed with their execution.  The Netsu ramen base has a nice rich flavour, not over-fatty despite the ground pork, and their hot sauce has a good heat. I was even more pleased with the Ji Su Men, though. Lots of veggies, fresh egg cooked in to a savoury broth to help thicken it, and noodles cooked properly so that they still have a bit of bite. Very tasty and a fine lunch at $8.95.  It's a ramen joint, don't expect stunning decor or brilliant music selections, but neither is the atmosphere distracting in any way.  Pro-tip: get the gyoza. Get. The. Gyoza. Freshly made to order and it shows. The greens in the filling are bright and fresh, again cutting the fattiness of the pork really well. Delicious, and utterly different from the pre-frozen lumps you get in most sushi joints. A bit expensive for a side dish, running as much as some of the mains, but they're big and an order would easily share 3 ways."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I don't know\"authentic\" ramen really tastes like.  However, I found my \"King Noodle\" ramen pretty darned tasty as my tastebuds don't lie to me.  Would've received another star had it not been for their \"terse attitude\" and customer service."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Ramen in Toronto, and Kenzo is easily the worst. Their Tonkotsu Shoyu broth is too thin and bland, and they add too many bean sprouts to their ramens, which completely kill the flavour. The pork is gristly and the noodles don't have any texture.   Calling this random soup \"ramen\" should be a crime, and so should charging $13 for it. Avoid this and take your money to Kinton (where it's worth the wait for a table)."}
{"text":"I guess like any restaurant you have to order the right things. At a ramen restaurant it is all about the broth, really is.... If you go to Kenzo you should order the Black Tonkotsu. It is probably one of the best in TO. I have tried their Shoyu ramen and the broth taste only of soya sauce - really have not found a good Shoyu ramen in TO - if you know of good one let me know.   It's all about the Tonkotsu at Kenzo - the accompanying pork char su is also very good."}
{"text":"2 reviews in 1  Gillian: I had the King of King ramen,  was very delicious,  not the best best I've had but pretty darn close.  The pork wasn't too too tender but was still delicious, the soup was great!!  Wasn't too salty which was great!!  I also tried the octopus balls,  I didn't like it but I don't like the item itself any other restaurant,  but my bf  liked it alot.  Too custardy for me,  wasn't enough seafood taste.   Quality is great Quantity could be more The staff was pretty friendly   Kevin: it was awesome.  I like good food.  I'm full... Mmm that is all"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed about their noodles. We older regular ramen, it took so long to serve us, when they brought the noodle, I was surprised, the noodle tasted like instant noodle, soup is just like regular red miso paste with boiling water. I just wondering why it take so long? It was my birthday to go there eat such disappoint noodle. If I can vote for no star on the review, I will definitely go with it."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen, Your porportions are more than enough to satisfy.  I sampled your goods for the first time yesterday, and was quite surprised when this massive bowl of ramen, pork, and various veggies landed in front of me.  I wondered if the waiter thought I was REAL hungry?!  Did I look hungry? I certainly don't look like a girl whose Mama hasn't fed.     I digress.  Back to the soup.  It was good stuff, my friends.  I enjoyed a tremendous bowl of Netsu Ramen, spicy level of 2.  (I'll note here, plus one star for not eyeing me with \"white girl spicy\" supsicions upon ordering up a mild amount of heat in my food.  Take note, Roti Cuisine of India on Dupont.)   An abundance of ramen noodles, clumps of ground pork, mushrooms, and other veggies swam about in a mild/moderate spicy broth, in a vat sized basin of delicious.     I'll be back to sample the gyoza and up another star if they deliver equally as well."}
{"text":"I always have to make a stop at kenzo every time i come to dt toronto. Their broth is very tasty and their noodles are cooked just right - the tonkatsu ramen is my go-to item every time i come here. The gyoza dumplings are huge and basically a meal in itself. Only thing i dont like is that their tables are wayyy too close together :("}
{"text":"Find me a fast food style Asian restaurant with good service in Toronto (or anywhere) and maybe I will start to agree with all these angry Yelpers!    This place gets a 2-star rating (maybe 2.5) not because of the service or lack thereof, but because the product just isn't that good.  Ok, perhaps I was a little spoiled having eaten at the might Ippudo in NY (which ruined all non-Ippudo ramen since), still, the broth wasn't very flavorful and the noodles were a bit dry/clumpy.  Again, it is a tiny little joint with limited seating - so not good for a group of 13 Yelpers.  I knew we were too much to handle when they had to resort to the 'non-matching' soup bowls.  That should have been a red flag that they were over capacity!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen.  I got the tsuke-men ramen which you dip in a dried fish broth which was very tasty.  It's a deep red colour but not spicy.  Sister got the veggie creamy ramen which had depth of flavour despite no bone broth.  Magical!"}
{"text":"The waitress was a bit impatient as I tried to explain to her exactly what I wanted in my noodle bowl. I feel like I didn't end up with exactly what I wanted. I also wish they had other flavors of broth instead of pork for those who do not want a vegetarian option. All in all, food was good. There was nothing special about this place - i would rather test out other noodle resturaunts than come back here. The portions were just right and the noodles came out fast. The atmosphere was good for a quick busy city noodle joint."}
{"text":"The ramen is ok i think this place is super busy because there isn't much ramen places in Mississauga. To get your quick ramen fix it is alright but not the best. Fast service avoid this place on weekends because of the line up. Ive pretty much tried everything on the menu but the best is the Tsukemen (noodles with a concentrated broth for dipping on the side)"}
{"text":"So we came here from using a deal online.  We walked in and there were lots of tables available.    The costs were fairly reasonable given the portion size that we had.  We each had a meal (soup dish and a noodle dish on hot plate) and shared the Octopus Balls.  It was more than enough food and we ended up taking some of the noodles home with us.    The soup was really salty and spicy.  The flavours were great however, it could had been ok with less salt/spice.  So for us to share the noodles and the soup was a good mix.  Not sure if I'd be able to have the soup on my own.  Ramen noodles itself were good and cooked perfectly.  Our food came super fast."}
{"text":"Really recommend Nagasaki!!!  Green tea latte is really really good, but way too expensive for what you get!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Unagidon for $14.95 which includes salad and miso soup. The eel was fairly good, but I still think it lacks a bit of taste. Service was really good considering we were really loud and didn't got kicked out. The waitress was nice and patient with us, answering all our questions like a professional."}
{"text":"I get take-out a lot for lunch, and that's always pretty smooth. The servers taking the order are always very nice, and my order's ready in literally 10 minutes. Amazing.  My boyfriend and I came by today, a Sunday, around 1 PM and I got HANGRY.  One of the other reviews nails it ... don't come when you're super hungry. Just don't.   Showed up behind one lone diner and a group of three. We stood around for about twenty minutes (which is much over my normal limit, which I established for the good of everyone) ... during that time, nobody asked us how many we were or let us know how long the wait was. Good luck flagging someone.   At one point, we were actually ready to leave, but were so set on ramen (we came for Sansotei, but it's not open on Sundays ... nor is Konnichiwa, and Kinton was bound to have a line), and a few tables were opening up by then. They had about two servers covering the entire restaurant.   Once we were seated, we got water pretty quickly and didn't linger over the menu, so we ordered almost right away.   The waitress who took our order 1) didn't hear my ramen order and luckily, asked whether I was really having just gyoza and 2) got my boyfriend's ramen order wrong (Sapporo instead of miso). He didn't make a fuss and liked it, but neither of us was impressed.  A different waitress brought us our food insanely quickly, both our bowls plus the gyoza. She kindly rearranged my tray and our table so everything fit, which was too nice.  The gyoza, which excellent (steamed and lightly panfried on the bottom, not deep-fried) and honestly the largest things I have ever seen, was too much. 6 for $9 ... I would have just preferred a smaller portion for two people sharing (4 for $6, even). I really wanted takoyaki, but again, too much for two.  I was charged $1 for hot tea, a cost the waitress didn't mention. It was a good tea bag, but seriously. Tea? Two soups + gyoza + Pepsi + tea = $36, pre-tip. Oof.   Good noodles, good broth. Wonderful egg. The tonkotsu is delicious. If I were damned to eat one thing forever, it would be noodles in hot soup. I blame my Asian heritage.  Oh, Kenzo. Why can't I hate you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is taking me here tonight because we're celebrating something and I thought, \"all I want is Kenzo.\"  Even if you have to wait- it's rarely for very long.  I've had the seafood ramen (I forget the actual name of it and I picked the squid out), which gave me acid reflux but it was soooo good. I had the King of King Ramen which is spicy to say the least- but delicious. My favourite is the Wonton Ramen- it's not in the menu, but there's a poster of it on the wall.  Best broth ever!  At least as good as Kinton, only you don't have to wait 3 hours to get a seat."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews-- but good for me, because I never have to wait in line, suckas!  Look, it's not the best ramen in the city (I'm looking at you, Kinton) -- BUT, I have never left here disappointed.  The Black Garlic Tokontsu is one of my most favourite dishes in all of Toronto and Kenzo makes one hell of a version.  The others are very salty and taste either very much like miso or soya.  They also don't have a huge menu, so you have to make the right choice.  The inside might be dark and the furniture might not be top notch -- but you know what? When I see new ramen restaurants or see lines out the door for all of these 'top notch' ones that everyone raves about and I feel like Kenzo is that really sweet girlfriend that you've got at home and don't have to put that much effort into.  She's the Betty to Kinton/Sansotei's Veronica.  Is she as wild in the sack? No. Will she keep you on your toes?  No.  But she's fast and is the cheapest in town and are beyond lovely to you.  I spoil myself with Kinton from time to time but I tried Sansotei and haven't been back once- I sit in Kenzo and laugh. Sansotei is NOT worth the lineup that it consistently has out the door.  That, or I got the wrong thing there because it's not the least bit memorable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ramen here, the pork meat was seasoned very well. I will definitely be coming here again, chatime is next door so I get a drink and eat it with my ramen. =) Price isn't bad and I really loved the taste of the broth, tasted creamy.  I had the pork ramen with the soft boiled egg."}
{"text":"Two check-ins later, what is my verdict? \"Slightly Inconsistent\".    GET THESE: When we come, we order these:  Hokkaido Ramen, Gyoza, and Takoyaki.   Oh? In English? This is what we ate:  Ramen - japanese egg noodle soup Gyoza - fried dumplings, typically filled with pork  Takoyaki - grilled breaded fish balls   TASTE TEST CHALLENGE: Ramen: 1st round - was almost perfect. Savory pork broth with chewy ramen noodles. 9 / 10 2nd round - noodles a bit soggy    7 / 10  Gyoza:   1st round - Died and gone to heaven!    10 / 10 Super piping hot and crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside! It's a perfect 10! 2nd round - even though it came out piping hot, this time a bit soggier, less crispy   8 / 10  Takoyaki: 1st round - Exceptional! Soft and creamy semi-sweet dough, filled with chunks of fish meat inside! Best part of the meal!  10 / 10 2nd round - although piping hot, the dough was soggy this time, but was still tasty  Come here for a great variety of soups and a few apps - all items under $13! Portions are pretty big! I could have shared - but - why?!?!?! Hehehe  Service is pretty quick for orders and receiving - but getting your bill is sometimes a challenge if you are in a rush!   CURRENT STATUS: Definitely worth a 3rd round!"}
{"text":"Having been raised on NYC ramen, I was hopeful that Kenzo would make the bar.  It is a fair enough ramen place but it needs to improve on its broth and its service if it is going to get more stars.  The broth is watery in my opinion and when we were served, it was rather scatterbrained and inept.  We received our appetizers (gzoza) after the ramen and it was quite a pain to hail down our waitress.  The ramen is okay. I expected better.  Sigh...."}
{"text":"This place has been one of my boyfriend's favorite places to get ramen and gyudon. It quickly became my favorite, as well. The service is always amazing, all of the waitresses and workers are extremely nice and polite. Sometimes at busy times (the place isn't huge, so it's expected) there can be a wait until being seated, but the food is brought out very promptly after placing your order.   My boyfriend usually orders the gyudon with extra egg, or tonkotsu ramen. My favorite here is the black tonkotsu ramen, chicken onigiri, or the gyudon. He always orders his specially with no veggies, etc. and they don't mind! I can never finish an entire bowl of ramen, so I always have them pack my leftovers.   The food is really delicious, and I always ask my boyfriend to take me here. I love it! I recommend trying the black tonkotsu ramen or regular!"}
{"text":"The ramen's good. Portion is a little small. You need to add a dollar for a bigger size.  There are two girls sitting next to me and one got a hair in her soup. The waitress said \"ah okay\" and changed the noodle for her. i just found it a little weird of their attitude towards the customers.  However, I'm just a starving person passing by and looking for some hot soup/noodle. If you don't care about service, this place would be totally fine for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Nice Noodle house steps from Eatons Centre.  The ramen  was cooked perfect and the soup was good-not salty but tasty.  The seating environment is clean/nice but not too large and hence you may need to wait at lunch-we try to go there a bit after the noontime rush and it's fine.  Pricing is a tad high but at least you get quality for that.  Zero issues with noodle but I tried the Yakisoba on a hot plate-tastes good but a bit oily-I guess it's a catch 22 where you can use less oil and it's burnt or more and have it unburnt.  I think I will stick with the noodles next time.  Service is excellent-Prompt and polite.  A side note-server sneezed away from the table off to the side and we noticed he went straight to the washroom to wash hands (unfortunately we don't always see that and glad to see he was concerned of hygiene).  Kudos for that!!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice, two weeks in a roll, and I loved it both time.  I drove passed by this place for two years, very curious but never stopped by bc it only had 3.5 lackluster stars on Yelp.  Well, spank my hiney and ready to cry;this place is the bomb.  Now let's frame my enthusiastic comment in perspective - that we live in \"Ssauga\", not in Tokyo or New York.  This is the best Japanese Ramen joint in all of Ssauga, in my opinion.  Last week, I had the Netsu Ramen, which was spicy, flavorful, and full of vegetables that I enjoyed. I loved how much sprouts they put in. My wife had the Shi-O ramen, and I got to try some, and thought it was very refreshing, subtle, and refined tasting.  I like the simplicity and the small size of Shi-O Ramen.  Last night four of us went to Kenzo, and I tried the Nakasaki Champon ramen. Wow, that blew me away. It was very flavorful.  It was spicy and yet not biting, and there was some underlying deep flavor, probably from the pork bone soup base.  My wife had the same thing, and she said she loved it, and was surprised it was not more expensive given the quality ingredients they put in.    My wife had some Gyoza. She said it was ok, but nothing she will miss.  I did not have any Gyoza as I make it a habit to focus on Ramen when I go to Ramen shop, and not distract my tastebuds. I only order for myself ramen, but bc I was with other people I got to try also Agedesi Tofu. I liked it - like 4 out of 5 stars.   What I really want to try is Takoyaki;next time for sure.  Now I serious doubt I will try Karaage chicken here, as I have spent last 10 years trying to find a legit Karaage Chicken and found only two places, only one of them in Canada (Taki restaurant in Niagra Falls)  All in all, this place is a winner.  I am sorry I drove by for two years without giving them a try. If you are in Ssauga, and you have a ramen craving, I would not hesitate to go here.  I plan to go back next week to try the - King of Kings Ramen.   The name is so large, I am so curious. Well today is one week after my initial review, and I did try the King of Kings Ramen.   I regret my choice.  I would stick with Nakasaki Champon , Netsu ramen or Shi-o ramen.  The King of Kings was way too much noodle, not enough broth, and the broth was not flavorful and satisfying.  I would rename this dish as WannabeKingofKingsRamen.  It was barely better than ramen I make at home, and I am not even sure about that.  BB"}
{"text":"The king ramen had a lot of stuff and delicious but too spicy for my taste.  Couldn't enjoy the noodles due to this. The rest of the menu didn't seem very appetizing and the yaki soba was too sweet.  More fast food tasting."}
{"text":"Netsu Ramen was very enjoyable.  The vegetables were firm and the broth had great undertones, was balanced and had just a bit of kick.    Friendly and fast little place!"}
{"text":"The Best Best Tonkotsu Ramen on this hemisphere!  Every single ingredient is so flavorful and so good that you get that tingly feeling with every spoonful!  I love it here and have eaten here many many times.  Mind you, I've never ordered anything but the Tonkotsu ramen."}
{"text":"Finding decent Ramen in Mississauga is rare and unfortunately Kenzo leaves much to be desired. Unless you order the king bowl, many of their dishes leave you hungry afterwards. And don't bother with the non-ramen dishes, they're not filling at all. I really wanted to like the place but you'll probably have to venture out more for any good ramen."}
{"text":"Alright we back in the review boyzzzzzz  Yelp FAM, we talkin the most underrated ramen shop in sauga. (even tho I'm pretty sure its like the only one lmao)  This place has the most BLESSED ramen ever. Now it says japanese noodle house, but they tricking you doe. Everybody here was Korean bruh made it 10x easier to communiCate ANNYEONGHASEYO BAYBEE  Ahjumma was so nice too. She was like ahhh how do young men without more food not grow up? Gave us more meat and egg bruh. Too good. No charge. It was too nice I was like OK give you more tip BAYBEE  Only negative is the cost. Costs $10 per bowl bruh, BUT WORTH. that is too good. Its quality so if you don't mind, give it a go.    Yeee"}
{"text":"Wow, it was wrong to assume a previous nightmare  with Kenzo Ramen at Yonge and Sheppard! This would be the go-to place for those who prefer light and brisk soup base and the balance is amazing! (I tried shoyu ramen, basic of all the basics) Very less watery taste and appropriate portion considering the base price of $9.00! Some may argue the size of the bowl however the toppings and noodle will justify all. 'Let me know if you can offer better quality at larger portion at the same price, you're already the god of food business and I'll be more than happy to work for you!' If there's a suggestion, I find the soup base could've been more savory although the current offering is already hearty! Not to mention the service is very attentive! I'll be pleased for another visit next time!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. From the time we went, we knew it was going to be excellent, and it was.  When you go there, you have to write your name on the waiting list, and there was a waiting list. The place was packed.  It's a very casual place, very clean, very casual and cool.  A great menu of Ramen noodles, including a few vegetarian options. We had the Tonkotsu Ramen and a Nagasaki Champon seafood Ramen. Both were excellent, tasted amazing. A lot of food.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Mississauga has a shortage of restaurants serving ramen. For this reason only, I visit Kenzo from time to time. Their food is all decent, but nothing really wows you. It's simply an above average place in a place with not too many above average places.   I've had a variety of their ramen dishes, as well as their takoyaki and gyoza. Their takoyaki is my favourite of their dishes, as it is done quite well. However, it's quite expensive at $10 for 6 pieces.   The service is very good here, you're treated promptly and well. There are some Japanese customs that are carried out such as greetings and other little things that I can appreciate as someone who's traveled to Japan.  I feel like the ramen here is a little expensive for what it is. Unless it's amazing (which it quite honestly isn't), I can't justify paying nearly double the price of a bowl of pho for a bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, that's the reality in most cases. Some places make ramen that's good enough to justify this - Kenzo doesn't.  It's still definitely worth going to for your ramen cravings, but don't expect anything near best-in-category levels."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen was mentioned in many food magazines and food websites. Korean owned Japanese ramen, pretty small cozy place in downtown. Yes, I agreed with some reviewers - the noodle is in a small portion with respect to the big bowl. Even when I'm not hungry, I can finish a bowl of noodle. lol  Food Quality: Good noodles quality but not quantity Service: Satisfied service Price: Not too shabby, reasonable prices Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"I was at Canada computers right next door to kenzo so we decided to walk in. They always have a line up out there door. There's a wait list outside the door so you can write down your name get chatime or go for a stroll and come back. This spot isn't anything outstanding but it's the most convenient ramen place close by to my area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating there for the first time with couple of friends, the ramen was pretty good for the price. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I work about a block away and I always look forward to trying out new places that are around me, which are numerous.   I've tried most of the places on this strip and I think Kenzo really stands out.  Excellent soup and great gyoza!!    This place makes some amazing Ramen and I love going there for lunch time and time again.     I usually get the Netsu-Ramen (Pork & Egg noodle) and I'll say that I probably could eat this dish every day.  Great service, and prices, I just wish the place was a little bigger."}
{"text":"When you go for sushi and the little starter miso soup isn't enough... well Kenzo got that sorted out. You can get a whole bowl of miso Ramen all to yourself! The only downfall is the line to get in. I ditched it the first time because the line was haunting. This time I caved in and waited to find out it was so worth the wait! You have to know if people are waiting for this it has to be awesome. And that it is!!! Super awesome indeed! Great service and super fast. We got our food quick and was out in no time. The line actually moves quickly because they are quick to serve and make your Ramen.  I highly recommend anyone to give it a try. Just remember there is a sign in sheet in the front door! Don't just wait in line, you'll go no where lol. Sign in first then they will call your name."}
{"text":"This is your standard ramen franchise. If you're looking for a fast, simple ramen bowl in Mississauga then this is your place to go. It is typically busy in the evening. There is a seating sign up list on the door as you walk in. We waited for about 10 minutes for a seat in the small restaurant. They use stools instead of chairs which makes hanging things like purses or jackets difficult.   Standard ramen menu. Settled on the tonkotsu black which was good. Only came with half an egg instead of the standard full egg that I'm accustomed to in Toronto. Overall, a good bowl of ramen especially for someone new to the cuisine."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going to Kenzo Ramen. The atmosphere and food was great. The only con I have is the lineup. We had to put on name on a waiting list. It was well worth it and I will be returning again."}
{"text":"This place was def a cool spot. I wasn't super hungry when we arrived but i was def looking forward to the ramen. Being from DC, we don't have that many ramen places. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen: it was really really good! The noodles were perfect, the soup well seasoned and perfect for our cold day. We also ordered the Takoyaki as an app, it was meh (Guu Izakaya is much better). Would I return, sure if I'm in the area. Will I have dreams about it, probably not!"}
{"text":"Wait line was long but they were organized and we got our table quicker than expected. Come before 1pm because this place get packed quick.   Ordered the tonkotsu (pork broth soup ramen)Very very tasty.  Service was excellent staff was polite.  Will return again soon."}
{"text":"It was OK. I went there at a friend's recommendation and I expected a lot more. I got the King of Kings ramen and it was somewhat on the bland side and it wasn't even spicy though they said a 2 is moderately spicy. Don't think I would go back"}
{"text":"Kinton Ramen is down the street and definitely worth taking a walk down the street.   Kenzo's ramen kind of fell flat and the broth wasn't as rich as other places I've had ramen at."}
{"text":"Kenzo on Dundas was one of the first ramen restos to bring the trend to Toronto and i love them for it. I always order the tonkotsu which i dream about. Cant recommend them highly enough although i wish they would bring more variety of snacks (eg agedashi tofu) to order alongside ramen."}
{"text":"Sent the hubby to pick up some take out here today:  Shoyu Ramen and Takoyaki.  The bill came to just under $21.  Surprisingly, the takoyaki costed more than the ramen itself.    As soon as he got home, I was so excited to open it as I haven't been feeling well so I really wanted some soup.  Initially, I thought maybe he forgot the takoyaki and ordered 2 ramens because the 2 containers weighed the same.  I opened it and was surprised with the size of the takoyaki balls, they are the size of a tidbit maybe even bigger.  Hmm...odd.  I've never seen them like that.  I opened the broth container, which was huge only to be disappointed that only about a quarter of the container was broth.  What a collosal waste of a massive container.  Ramen:  the portion ratio of broth to noodle is completely off.  So much noodle for such little broth.  Almost reminded me of a lomein.  The broth itself was disappointing.  Because there was raw mushrooms, the broth just started to take on the flavour.  Didn't taste like pork anymore, it is amateurish at best.  The pork itself is tough and chewy with no flavour.  This is odd because I just had Kenzo on Queen 2 wks ago and the Shoyu definitely did not taste like this.  Takoyaki:  I'm sorry but this is not takoyaki.  I've had so much takoyaki in the past month I can taste it in my head just as I peruse the pics on yelp.  This was dense, mushy and heavy probably because it's baked vs. fried.  Because it was made so big and dense and the sauce is quite watery, it was soggy so when picking up with a chopstick it was like a big slop.  The sauce, oh boy all I tasted was mayo.  There was no Bonito flakes on top.  It was definitely not authentic.  Considering it costed more than the ramen, they should be ashamed of themselves.  The Japanese spot at Square One Food court makes 100x better takoyaki than this for half the price.  It's a shame.   I understand I ordered take out and the car ride may have compromised the food itself but not to this extent.  I think I will be avoiding this Kenzo."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I thought the ramen was average. I found it weird that they charged me $1 for hot water."}
{"text":"First thing you do when you arrive is to put your name on the waiting list just inside the first set of doors. Waited about half an hour on a Saturday night. Attracts a distinctly younger crowd. Inside quite small hence the wait for a table. Everything made fresh in-house and one can tell. The roasted pork shoulder was tender and simply delicous, just not enough of it. The fried tofu was actually quite good. Three levels of spicy, 1 to 3, I chose 2 and it was very spicy! My family loved Kenzo, me I would love it if there was less veggies and more meat."}
{"text":"Came back to try again after a long while.  I must say it has improved so much!!  Really delicious now!  I think we went 3 times in one week. Lol  Its usually very busy, and a wait to get a table.  You write your name on a list by the door to get a table, and they will call you when its ready.  I really like their creamy vegetarian ramen.  I'm not a vegetarian but its my favourite so far."}
{"text":"Overrated imo, the ingredients are cheap and sparse, the atmosphere isn't anything special, and portions are small and aren't filling, for $10/meal, I would much rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the Vegetarian option of Ji Su Men and it was so good! I burnt my tongue from the soup, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place the other night and wanted to give it a try. Got a chance to stop by for a snack meal at 4pm. There was a line with about 15 min wait which was a good sign. So we put our name on the little sign up sheet on the wall and waited.   The staff are friendly. The sign saids they make everything in house. The broth, the noddles, etc.  I got the tonkotsu miso ramen and it was good. Not the best I have had but definitely not bad. The atmosphere is pretty nice. They were very busy but the place was very clean. Nice open kitchen so you can see them making the food. It's small with about 12 or so tables. I will definitely come back for more next time."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in Mississauga but this location is great too. I love ramen and i can't remember the one i always get but all of them are delicious! I like how their chopsticks are not the cheap wooden ones. The matcha smoothie is not that good but i think its more on how it was done"}
{"text":"Good ramen!  I couldn't finish the bowl full, and that's how it should be.  Come here to warm up and induce a sodium-carb-coma.  yum!"}
{"text":"Very yummy ramen, very moderate prices! I always ask for the vegetarian broth with tofu since I don't eat pork. I find it very filling and it is quite enjoyable. I always get level 2 spicy and its just the right amount of spice. Usually comes up to 12-13 dollars. Not bad for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Its a great place. But I find all the soup at Kenzo Ramen places to be a bit more salty than I would like it. But that can just be preference."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent.  I really don't know what makes this place stand out to be honest. The restaurant itself is decent, the ramen is decent, the service is decent, and the prices are, again, decent. It's nothing to write home about. I wouldn't choose this place to introduce my friends to ramen or anything like that.  It's a decent place to eat if you're in the Bloor-Spadina area, but if you've got a better place in mind, I'd go for that instead."}
{"text":"The BEST ramen in the west side (ok maybe the ONLY ramen, lol)! This place rocks. I'm a huge RAMEN addict so I've tried it all. Living in mississauga means we have lots of Chinese and pho but this takes the cake for Asian noodles. Highly recommend the TONKUTSU RAMEN. Level 2 spice. Chase it with a taro milk bubble tea from Chai Time next door!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my family today (labor day -- so yes, they are open). The waiting time wasn't so bad for us but am sure it can be a pain on most days when they are REALLY busy. The waiting area isn't large either so sometimes you would have to wait outside if your a big party of people wanting to dine in.  When you come in and would have to wait for a table, they make you write your name and the number of people your with (or they write it for you) in a clipboard next to the door. I think that's very efficient on their part.   But sadly, this place was \"just okay\" for me. It's not something I would constantly go back for but it's not bad to have either when you just want some ramen in your system especially if  your in Mississauga.   I had their Karashi ramen and it was alright, not a fan of the broth but I guess it gets getting used to. The other dishes we ordered are gyoza (my family devoured it), karaage (it was decent, not the best I've seen on a plate), yakisoba (it was decent), Katsudon (decent as well), and a vegetarian ramen that was good according to a family member.  Staff is extremely nice and the place is decent. Very casual indeed.   In conclusion, I would come back here but not anytime soon. It's not that bad but it's not on one my top choices either."}
{"text":"I love their spicy ramen soup. The food was delicious, unfortunately the staff was not very nice, every time we ask for something in the menu they say they didn't have and minutes after they will come out from the kitchen with what they just said they didn't have. Delicious food. I will get it to go instead of eating there."}
{"text":"Torontonians, you guys are so lucky to have a variety of specialty Japanese ramen shops to choose from. Come to Texas and you'll realize why I must try ramen in any city that offers it. It could just be the supply/demand imbalance, but I thought the ramen at Kenzo was quite delicious. The King of Kings bowl left my mouth on fire and I liked it! Not to mention, the portion size was enormous and the amount of meat was plentiful. The takoyaki balls were all mushy and gushy, piping hot on the inside, and filled with large chunks of octopus. If I'm ever in Toronto again, I will be back!"}
{"text":"There are a few Kenzo locations in the GTA, including this small downtown setup along Dundas Street. The tables are wobbly and squished in. Service is fast, but spotty. And you may get ignored if you come in and find the place packed. But boy, do they make some decent noodle dishes.  Definitely go for the King of Kings ramen. It is an insane medley of pork and fish meatiness, hot spiciness, veggies and onions, saltiness and umami. What a filling mouthful it is. A big bowl to match the amount of toppings you get.  Great place for a quick big warm lunch.  {TTC (this location): 505 streetcar @ Bay St.}"}
{"text":"After visiting Kenzo I finally understand the saying \"There's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!\" A celebration of flavour, meat, and perfectly cooked noodles.  My friend and I visited this location, it was not my first time trying Ramen but it was my best time. Kenzo has Ramen down to a science! I got the \"king of kings ramen\" spicy level 3. To my surprise it was actually spicy I considering myself to have a tongue of steel not many places can make food that I consider spicy. That being said if you can't handle a lot of heat I suggest spicy level 1. The soup consisted of house made noodles, bbq pork, fish cake, and veggies. The staff was very friendly and attentive, great atmosphere, there's an open kitchen you can hear the chefs singing while watching flames fly.  I don't dish out 5 stars often but Kenzo meets all the criteria - Good food, good service, good atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!  Everyone was super friendly, and we even chatted with a couple that was seated nearby.  So, there's a ramen contest here-eat an entire bowl at a level 20 in regards to its spiciness, and get it for free.  Our server warned us that it was REALLY spicy, so I got a level 2 (I was sweatin' a bit, to tell you the truth!  And I always get spicy ramen that never tastes that spicy!!) with pork and mushrooms, and my boo got a level 6 (I think that was the 1st tier haha).  He was dying and I had a few spoonfuls and YES, it was THAT spicy.  But it was still tasty, at least!  We also got an order of the gyoza, which was huge size wise!"}
{"text":"Came here a while back with my parents for lunch. Small place but pretty busy.  I find the value was fair as you get big potions. Good change from pho every once in a while.  Service was good, did not charge my mom for the green tea.    Guess the chef forgot the order of Takoyaki. Once mentioned, it was ready in a couple minutes."}
{"text":"Their broth is one of the better ones I've had (except for the high salt content - take it down a notch and it would be perfect).  In comparison to Ajisen Ramen,  which really should me called MSG-sen for their reliance on that flavour enhancer, Kenzo wins hands down for a more authentic broth."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast n very good.  Will definitely come back for another bowl of ramen.  Got the Miso favour with Pork bone soup base ramen."}
{"text":"It was cloudy and cold and I was jonesing for some good, comforting ramen.   A friend had raved about Kenzo so I was excited to give it a shot as I was in the area.  Like a little kid on Christmas Eve, I couldn't help but smile ear to ear as I placed my order of Tonkotsu Pork Ramen and takoyaki balls; giddy that they had two of my favourite foods in one restaurant.   Good food, much like good wine, is a multi-sensory experience.  It's got to look good, smell good, taste good, and make you feel good.   My ramen came first and it looked pretty good... it had 3 pieces of pork belly, half of a boiled egg, slices of fish ball, seaweed strips, and a HECK of a lot of bean sprouts garnished with green onions.   As I took my first whiff of my soup bowl, I smelled - nothing.  Well, not nothing, of course it still smelled like pork broth, but not in the same welcoming, comforting way a good ramen normally smells like.    Reluctantly, I took my first bite of ramen and my fear was confirmed.  It wasn't bad; but the ramen did not hold up to my expectations.  The ramen was cooked well, the egg would've been better if the yolk was still soft, the pork belly was seasoned well but not as soft as i expected, and the broth was lacking that certain flavour Tonkotsu pork one can only get from hours upon hours of long simmering.   It's not bad - it's a definite step up from those you get from AYCE places; but not the best I've ever had either.    The takoyaki ball looked great; but the flavour was also lacking... It tasted like it was frozen at one point... The batter was a little gummy and overly sticky; the octopus, bland.     I like that they have the traditional katsuobushi shavings on top. I won't be ordering this again.   Maybe I picked the wrong ramen? I may give this place another shot next time... but for now, a mere 2 stars from me."}
{"text":"THE KING is a great soup.. Dundas location is SUPERIOR...  The decor/setting.  Yonge location had really bad dancey/pop music playing, way way too loud and completely ODD for the environment, completely annoying.  In the end a one time visit.  Stick to the BLOOR or DUNDAS spots.  simply better..."}
{"text":"THE KING..  I ordered it the first time I went there and to this day, still the only one I order; it's GOOD.  Even went there on my wedding night (hey, I'm cheap!  Plus 2nd marriage!!!). Great service, fast and tastes good, would eat it right now if I wasn't typing this."}
{"text":"There is always a line up during dinner hours. We dont mind waiting when the food is great. We have been here many times as it is the only good ramen place in Mississauga. The experience has been pretty good. The service is quick, they make everything fresh hence the wait is a little longer than most noodle places.   They are yummy! The portion is pretty decent. However, I find their appetizers a little expensive and little portion hence why we only order ramen but nothing else.   Keep up the great work Kenzo!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good.  It's pretty close to the eaton centre, and quite frankly, its the first time in a while my food came out looking just like the picture.  I ordered the King Shoyu Ramen and wasn't disappointed.  We came here for lunch on a Friday around noon, luckily the line wasn't too long, considering there isn't all that much seating.  My friend ordered the spicy something, and she was happy with her meal.  The service was ok considering the time of day.  It was a massive bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Chinese ramen this is the right place. The taste is just alright. I ordered their quite expensive Takoiyaki but it was burned on the outside and uncooked on the inside. They don't have much food choices. Overall i will not coming back."}
{"text":"Food is great but the price is a bit high.  There is no host system in the store and the place is not fully utilized. Hopefully the manager will come up with a better layout for the store."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is the fact it's closed Sunday.   I f$&&in love their soup.    If you like authentic ramen give this place a try.   You'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stood at the front of the door for a good 5 mins and didn't get a single acknowledgement to sit down at table. On top of that, the restaurant wasn't even busy. How does one do business this way?"}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way, I don't know what \"good\" ramen is, but I have to say. I'm a fan of this place.   I have had the King Ramen, and really love Takoyaki.  Long story short, the food came out fast, delicious, and the service is great.  They refill water, ask if we are doing fine, and even say thank you and good bye.  Also... this has basically become the trend for all ramen places but yes... they have toothpicks and mouthwash in the washrooms too.    For anyone who needs to \"graduate\" from instant noodles, or just can't make it to downtown Toronto (apparently where the best ramen places are) check out the local Kenzo Ramen.

{"text":"This is what happens when I don't have access to Yelp in real time and I didn't research ahead of time...after two awesome sushi experiences in Toronto I felt confident randomly walking into a random ramen place.  Big mistake.  Bland, yet salty broth."}
{"text":"this place was recommended to me by a friend awhile back.  i ordered the tonkotsu ramen- soooo good. the broth was absolutely delicious. everything was tasty.  the seating area is pretty small, luckily when i went with some friends, it wasn't too crowded."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of my friends for my birthday this weekend. I was pretty much disappointed.   I had their Ji-Su Ramen, and when it came I just lost my appetite after one bite.  Their takoyaki was not that great either.   Their waitress service is..pretty bad tbh. This one waitress of theirs was pretty rude and charged me extra and continued to argue with me about it.   Overall, quite over rated. Would not probably go back due to bad service"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I finally got to try out the Ramen at Kenzo. I'm just that it wasn't busy when we got there a little after 7pm.  My friend and I both ended up ordering the Karashi Ramen which was decent enough. But because we were both having a good chat, I didn't really get to have a proper taste of the Ramen but it was decent enough, the serving which come in one size was large enough and also filling. My friend also ordered a tofu in soya sauce appetizer and that also tasted good. All-in-all, a satisfactory dining experience."}
{"text":"Oh boy, I really liked this ramen place. Let's start with the environment with wooden chairs but still large enough to be comfortable. The washroom was very clean and modern and probably because of the garlic of the ramen they had listerine there with small paper cups for customers. Service was courteous and sincere and finally, and most important, the food was absolutely delicious! The king of kings ramen was great and the fried chicken with honey mustard house made sauce made my lunch perfect! I do recommend. Only thing to look for is the time to go, it can get busy around noon, so I suggest getting there a bit earlier or later."}
{"text":"Okay. Let me put this out there, I'm no pro at determining the ultimate Ramen dish. I can tell what has a good flavour and definitely if things are under or overcooked.   I just moved here from Vancouver. A place known for it's incredible range of Asian cuisine including that thing called Ramen.  My friend took me here telling me that i must try this. I'm always a little weary but new city, new food - why not!  I was pleasantly surprised! the noodles were tasty with just the right consistency.  The broth was inhale-able (is that a word?)  We also ordered their gyoza. Wow! The filling was divine! Not soggy or overcooked.  It beats Kintaro`s Ramen and gyoza in Vancouver any day!    The bad side of this place is the service.  They forgot the water and it seemed like they completely missed the boat on getting the gyoza to our table but it came after we were half way finished our Ramen.  I would lie to say the reason why would be the lunch rush but there was just us and another table.  i can't imagine the mayhem at rush hour so I'm glad to go during its down time.  ps...good value for your pocket"}
{"text":"Meh...Mediocre at best. Hard to write a review when I have zero adjectives or eureka moments that surface when consuming excess calories that do not bring me happiness. It's an edible meal. Probably one of the better ramen places in Mississauga area, but that's not saying much considering I haven't come across any breath taking ramen locations around square one, or any other ramen locations around the area for that matter.   It's noodles, and it's soup. Meat too tangy and chewy, you leave with the taste of lingering msg in your mouth, broth tastes..neutral? I'm not even sure how to describe it because it just tastes like salty flavored water. Beggars can't be choosers since there's no other ramen place to peg it against. So ask me if I'll go again? Probably if I'm craving Japanese ramen and don't feel like commuting 30 minutes into down town core, but peg it against any downtown ramen location that I'm hoping will sprout out in the middle of suburbia, and I probably won't be a periodical visitor at this location. Fast service. Clean location. Free parking.    Bottom line. Acceptable if you're trying to fill a meal and want to suffice that ramen craving in Mississauga Sqaure One region. If you're looking for mind boggling food experience, save it for elsewhere. Neither recommend nor protest."}
{"text":"I've been twice in three days so I guess the least I can give it is four stars.  :)  The food is great and not too expensive.  The place is small but fast so the wait isn't too bad.  I don't want to give it 5 stars as I need to become better versed in ramen.  However, this place rocks!!  The King of Kings ramen is a great winter soup.  The meat is fresh, not over cooked, and not too salty.  The egg on top is cooked to perfection and is flavorful.  The broth is also tasty and spicy.  I can take much more spice but am happy with this one without having to doctor it much.  I'll be going back I'm sure.  The better I get at ramen knowledge, I will come back and update.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The food is above average, but the service is really bad. I ordered something to pickup 20min later, but I had something urgent to do and then I called the restaurant. A Japanese girl answered the telephone, I spoke to her in English during the entire call, but she always interrupted me and said she could not understand what I said. I wanted another person to answer the call, but she refused to do that. Finally, I went to the restaurant and she felt *very well* about her service. I didn't receive any 'sorry' for my bad experience, although I paid 13% tips. I won't be here again."}
{"text":"yumm best ramen ever. Be ready for a tight space and it to be busy but YUM."}
{"text":"Nothing warms up a winter night like a steaming hot bowl of ramen and Kenzo does the job.  Their soup bowls are big and beautiful!!"}
{"text":"The soup of the ramen is not as flavorful as other ramen places, so for me is not that good. Service is good."}
{"text":"Visited Kenzo for the first time today with a friend. We came for lunch and arrived around 11, the place was fairly empty except for a few occupied tables. We were promptly seated and got straight to looking over the menus.   The menu was rather substantial with something for everyone. I chose the tonkotsu ramen while my friend had the orochong ramen. We also shared some hot sake, which I found for the price of 6 dollars to be not bad as they did not skimp in quantity as some places do. The ramen arrived quickly and we got straight to eating. I was instantly overwhelmed by the large bowl of piping hot noodles which was oh so comforting in the -30 weather. The broth was rich but did not feel heavy, and the portion of toppings was generous except for the egg, similar to most places it was only half an egg.   Overall,I left full yet not disgustingly so. At 10 dollars the price is standard but I definitely feel I got my money's worth. If you feel it's still not enough food however you can upgrade to a larger ramen for a dollar or try one of the side dishes offered such as gyoza or takoyaki (both of which looked good).   If you are in the area I would recommend stopping in for a quick but satisfying meal. However I would stay away from peak hours as seating is limited."}
{"text":"Tons of flavor. It might have been from a lack of food but I really enjoyed the tonkotsu ramen here. It was really flavorful and savory. If my friend and I were not short on time, I probably have came back for another dish. Other than the food, the location is okay.   The service was average with the waiters coming occasionally to refill water. There was a time when the waiter was rushing to fill our glasses then ended up spilling some water to the side. I mean like he filled two glasses in like 2 seconds kind of rush. The location is smaller since it is in the city.   Overall, tasty ramen and I wanna check it out if I'm around the area. It is closer to a 3.3-3.5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Feels like you're in Tokyo.  Really, really, really good food.  The only thing is the line up doesn't stop until about 9"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places I've been to! Totally recommend it. This place can be sometimes packed though but honestly it is worth the wait! The portions are big which is very filling. The food tasted great! Would definitely come back next time if I'm craving for some ramen!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with the fiancee and we ordered the ff: tonkotsu shoyu ramen, yakisoba and 3pcs gyoza.   The tonkotsu broth was very tasty. The egg was overcooked. The yakisoba was tasty and cooked well. The gyoza pieces were big and very tasty.  However we found it a little expensive as the ramen and yakisoba cost $10.99 each. The gyoza cost $5 for 3 pcs. With taxes and tip it set us back $32 for 3 items.  Will be back if I need my ramen fix in Mississauga"}
{"text":"I came here once or twice when it first opened a long time ago and I didn't think it was very good. I came back years later to meet up with a friend I haven't seen for a while because she chose it, expecting the same quality. I was pleasantly surprised at how much it changed.   I could never understand why there was such a huge lineup every night when I drove past this place. Now I know. I got the Black Tonkotsu Ramen and usually I find that Japanese Ramen broths are too salty for my liking, but this time it wasn't. I drank the entire soup.. it was really good. I had 3 thick meaty cuts of charsiu which was another deterrent in the past where I remember getting two super thin and fatty cuts.   Staff was super polite and nice. Although it was very busy, I'd say we were adequately attended too. I felt like we stayed a long time just chatting and they didn't even attempt to drive us out even though it was super busy.   I'd need to go again to make sure it wasn't all a dream."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was a couple years ago, when they first opened. I got some basic bitch ramen and it wasn't memorable.  This time, I actually had a craving for ramen and got the black tonkotsu. Unfortunately, it's nothing compared to Sansotei. There's barely any garlic flavor. In fact their broth is almost flavourless compared to Sansotei. So, it was a little disappointing.  Like my friend said, it's not the best ramen but it fulfills the craving.  The pork was amazing though. I have to give them that. It's thicker than most places and so juicy and tender. I really enjoyed this.  Noodles were basic, nothing really to write home about. They were good. A lot of bean sprouts though. So maybe ask to skip on these if you're not into bean sprouts. I felt it could've done without the ginger. I like ginger but I didn't really appreciate the surprise taste in some of my bites. I don't feel it's necessary in ramen.   Service is hella quick. Duh, it's just soup and the wait was pretty hefty but it went by fast. There were about 12 or so groups ahead of us but they got to our name in about 25 mins.  The sign up sheet is convenient but not for people that don't know this system. How would someone know this without having to asking first?  There aren't great ramen places in the peel region, so this might be the best you can get without having to go downtown or more towards Markham."}
{"text":"Great value, would love a create your own ramen option though. Great staff, Always nice and happy to greet you!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places. The portion sizes are incredible and I always love the way the ramen tastes. However, if you go on a Friday-Sunday night, you may find yourself waiting for quite a bit because the place is small."}
{"text":"This place is an okay but contains many flaws that stop it from becoming a excellent restaurant. Firstly, Kenzo contains a wide variety of Ramens to choose from including Netsu Ramen and Nagasaki Champon. During my visit, I had the Mi-so Ramen and it was good. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the soup was seasoned very well. However, not all parts of this restaurant was as good as the food. The atmosphere of this restaurant can be uncomfortable as this restaurant is very small. Everything feels squished in and disorganized. The table setting could use some improvement. The servers were good but could be improved on. At times, our server was no where to be seen and we were kept waiting. This restaurant contains many flaws with its atmosphere and its servers but the food really makes up for it. I rate this restaurant 3 stars and I would recommend this restaurant to any Ramen lovers."}
{"text":"Quick Breakdown: +  Noodles cooked well +  Nice atmosphere +  Soup Broth is amazing  Full Review:  (Because of the theme and writing style of the Full Review, I included the Quick Breakdown to outline what I liked and did not like. If possible, I prefer you read the full review instead).  A man does not simply eat a bowl of spicy noodle soup. Every bowl of ramen requires the correct waza (technique in Japanese) and the perfection of kata (form in Japanese) to comprehend the correct form of slurping down noodles.  To all my friends here on Yelp, white belts to black belts in Yelping, beginners to experts, I present, \"Kenzo Ramen.\" So sharpen your blades, unsheathe your chopsticks and soup spoon, prepare your gi, step into the dojo, and enter with me into the mystical world of ramen. Only the strongest and bravest survive. With all your mettle, will you be capable of defeating a spicy ramen. Today I, Rao R., was ready to walk the Path of the Ramen.  On a cloudy afternoon, when the sun was bright, and the air was peaceful, I stepped into the threshold of Kenzo Ramen. A waitress led me towards my table near the window staring out into the parking lot. The decor and outfits of the waitresses fused the traditions of Japanese culture with a modern twenty-first century setting.  I perused the menu, contemplating on which ramen should be my next victim. I decided to order the Netsu Ramen, a spicy ramen with chicken and stir-fried vegetables. A waitress keenly takes my order. I eagerly await the arrival of my bowl of spicy ramen.  The bowl of ramen steps out from the kitchen and lays right in front of me. The smell of delicious spicy ramen soup filled my nostrils with thrills of excitement.  I calmed myself into a state of zanshin (state of awareness). Meditation calms the Yelper Warrior before a food battle. The battle music begins to kick in. I readied myself into battle stance. I equipped myself with ceramic chopsticks and spoon, with napkins on the side. Round one. FIGHT!  I immediately begin slurping down the noodles. Geysers of flavors burst into my mouth with joy. The ramen countered with an intense kick of spiciness, inflicting damage to my mouth (sen no sen). I pulled my wits together and endured the spicy broth (the art of ukemi: aikido). To my advantage, the noodles were soft and cooked well, easing my process. The broth was nicely brewed, as the spicy flavors did not overwhelm the other ingredients. The vegetables complimented well with the spicy broth and noodles, adding a nice crunchy texture. As I reach the last remaining bits of the ramen, I stared down at the bowl. I slurped down all the noodles and finished the soup in the bowl. A ikken hissatsu. I remain victorious, standing fiercely on top of the world. Check please!   Walk the Path of the ramen at Kenzo. You are a true Yelper, fearlessly defeating any ramen that stands in your way. All the beloved bowls of ramen will fall at your feet. You are ready [gives chopsticks and bows]. OOSSSS!!!"}
{"text":"I ruined my shirt. And it was worth it.  It's maybe not the best idea to be eating foodstuffs like ramen (or pho for that matter) while dressed up. Or maybe one must eat super delicately? I've apparently never gotten the hang of eating ramen without looking like a toddler discovering his fingers for the first time in his life. Soup spatter stains. Everywhere.  What I had was enjoyable. I believe it was the Netsu Ramen. The flavor of the broth was really good, and it was quite filling. Everything was delicious overall, with the only detraction being that the ground pork was kind of... flavorless? I don't know if that's normal and maybe the broth was supposed to do the heavy lifting in the flavor department, but it was so flavorless that I could have enjoyed eating it without the pork being a part of it. Which... that should horrify people that I would consider eating something without meat in it.   The gyoza was good. Quite good in fact. I want more gyoza. Gyoza. Gyozaaa. Gayozaaa. You ever start saying a word and then feel like you've forgotten how to say the word?  Prices are all floating around $10. There are I believe a couple of cheaper options but the most popular items are all in the $10+ range. I have no point of reference on these prices, so I don't know whether to rate up or down... Let me know for future reference."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why this place doesn't have 4+ ratings. I waited about 5 minutes to be seated and they greeted me very politely which instantly set me in a better mood to eat. Once I made my order it took no more than 10 minutes for me to receive my meal. I ordered the miso ramen and it was DELICIOUS. Probably the best I've had.  If you're looking for some good eats for lunch on a budget and perhaps you like being served by cute asian waitresses this might be the place !"}
{"text":"One of the few viable options on Dundas between Spadina and Yonge St., and a plausible destination at which to recharge after a day of horrible, horrible, but unavoidable shopping in the Eaton Centre or visiting the AGO if you don't want to venture into Chinatown, especially in the dead of winter.  I've been twice, and I don't see why I won't be going back several times.  The King of Kings ramen is rich, spicy, and chock full of crunch and tasty tidbits, including sliced and ground pork and a nice egg.  The servings are *humongous* -- bring an appetite, or prepare to be defeated and exhausted as you dive into a bottomless bowl.  The noodles are passable; I've certainly had better.  My friend, who recently ate his way through Japan, said it compares favourably with what you'll get at most places there, and I would rate it just slightly lower than my favourite of all time, Saiwaii Ramen in SF.  The Osaka octupus balls are *insanely* rich, and even six is far too many for two people, consisting as they do of soft cheese (I only found out later that this is what they are made of ... glad I didn't know before I ordered them ... also since when do Japanese dishes involve dairy?!?) doused in super-sweet teriyaki sauce.  I loved the shaved dry octopus on top.  Oddly, they were a little bit like small melted, spherical seafood okonomi (PS: see my review of Okonomi House for the genuine article).  This is not a cheap fill-up, but it's probably the best value in this neighbourhood (which exploits suburban shoppers who don't want to venture too far from Yonge & Dundas when they come to town), and even worth a visit if you live elsewhere in the city.  The tables are small, and it's pretty busy, so I can't really recommend it for a party of more than 2-3."}
{"text":"Great place if you like soups.   Located on Queen St West, you will find parking at a nearby green P about a block or two away.   The service was prompt and genuinely friendly.   The food is ok. I ordered a rice bowl of chicken and rice. It came with a tiny salad and miso soup. There were ligaments on the chicken which I didn't like and the egg a were a little on the wet side.   The table next to us ordered the soup with muscles and shrimp. It looked so good. So if I ever go to this place again that is what I will order.   Pricing, I would say a bit over priced for the meal I ordered.  But it is in a busy area so it's expected.   Small venue, decor a bit dated. Bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.   Overall I would say 4 for friendliness, prompt, and location.  3 for food, decor, and bathroom.   So my score is actually 3.5."}
{"text":"Don't come here! The broth was so salty and they only have pork, bean sprouts and green onion as toppings. Service was also not great."}
{"text":"So I came back here after 2-3 years and I'm actually surprised by how the menu has actually expanded.  There was a lot more selection.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen - I was actually surprised by how good the ramen was and how I was disappointed (I guess if you have low expectations, then anything is good).  However, I was quite disappointed with the service.  I think they actually forgot about our orders at the time.  My friend and I sat there for quite some time and the people who sat next to us (who came in later and ordered later) got their food before us.  Not only that, when we ordered tea, we still didn't get it until we bugged them for it later."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I, plus the boyfriend came here for a late dinner.  It's a pretty busy spot but there aren't much seating room to start with, and then wait time is ridiculous. Thankfully there's a Chattime next door.  They couldn't seat us down for 8, so we split the group up by four and four. The first four sat down first while the second four waited for an empty table.  By the time we sat down, our server was quick to help us with beverages and menus. We ordered quickly since we were all starving. I got the creamy vegetarian ramen, it didn't look as appetizing as the others but it's pretty good.  The wait staff all were very attentive, made sure we had everything we needed.  When we all had to get up to pay, it was pretty big mess with so many of us and so little room to stand for our turn. Since I sat at a different table from the boyfriend, I was going to pay for my meal, but the boyfriend insisted he paid, which would have made it a little more complicated. We told the staff who was cashing us out, we'd pay separately but the staff went ahead and put our bills together and made our life easier. Going above and beyond when they didn't have to."}
{"text":"Average ramen shop.  Can't compare to Kinton, Santouka or Sansotei in downtown Toronto.  However, this is the only Japanese noodle shop in Mississauga & I'm happy to enjoy a bowl of tonkotsu ramen when I'm home.  Definitely go for the Kenzo's recommended dishes!  If you like spicy, you can order the 3 peppers level.  If you can finish the whole spicy bowl with soup, your meal is on the house!"}
{"text":"I love ramen and this is the best place downtown to get your ramen from. Enjoy your ramen with a green tea matcha drink :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on February 24 at around 2PM. When we arrived, the place wasn't that packed and only 3 tables were filled. After we sat down, a mob of people came in and almost half of the restaurant was filled! After we were seated, we took a quick glance at the menu and decided what to order. Our waitress was very attentive and took our orders promptly. I went with the Nagasaki Champon (Seafood) and my girlfriend went with \"The Kings of the Kings Ramen\" (she's so fancy)! I also ordered the Matcha Green Tea Smoothie.   My green tea smoothie took about 10 minutes to come out and it was kind of too bland for me. It had a milky but not too sweet green tea taste. It was good, but just not my kind of drink. Our food came out probably around 15 minutes after we ordered it, which isn't too bad. My seafood ramen was awesome, mostly because I love seafood and the soup base tasted great. It came with a decent amount of seafood (Shrimp, scallops, and mussels) and noodles. One minor complaint I have is that the shrimp should be unshelled, this makes it easier to eat especially when eating ramen...or maybe I'm just picky! As for my girlfriend (she's a picky eater), she thought that it was just okay. They could have gave less toppings, primarily the bean sprouts because it seemed like there were more of that than noodles. Another thing is that she didn't like the smokey flavor of the pork, but that depends on your taste. One thing that we both agree on is that the noodles had a great texture to it, it was an awesome smooth and soft texture.  As for the service, I thought our waitress did a great job. She accommodated with our requests and was very attentive. She came back often enough to not annoy us, but enough for us to request items if we needed. Our ramens didn't come out quick, but it wasn't so long that we would complain. We also got a coupon for 5$ off 25$ the next time we visit :)  Overall, I had a great time and meal at Kenzo. If I am ever in the Toronto area, I would definitely come back here and try the other ramen. Not only was the is service great, the food was delicious as well. Definitely a place to check out if you're around the Toronto-Downtown area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite noodle houses in Mississauga. The noodles and dumplings are made in-house, and are amazing! They also have huge pieces of Tako Yaki, and you have to try the Onigiri. It's a little bit pricey for one piece of Onigiri, but it's a fairly large piece and super tasty. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the location is a bit small, and tends to get busy sometimes."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. We had just come back from eating ramen everyday in japan so this was totally reminiscent of the vending machine/standing table joints found everywhere in Tokyo.   The first time we were super rushed, like, \"can you make this in 5 minutes? we have to leave in 15?\". And they did! It was first thing Saturday morning and empty ... but the broth came out fresh, it was simple, the noodles were good. No complaints!  The second time, the place was totally packed but same quality. Definitely will be my go to ramen place!"}
{"text":"We've had better. But, in Mississauga, where finding a good specialized ramen joint is like finding a needle in a haystack, I guess this will have to suffice for now. In short, Kenzo's one of Mississauga's very few options at the time of this review.  I've visited this location a couple of times and I've had the Shio Ramen, the Miso Ramen, the Shoyu Ramen, and the Tonkotsu Ramen. I've also had the gyoza and a couple of other starters. Overall, very average. Out of all of these, I think I enjoyed the Tonkotsu one best (although, for what it is, it's a bit overpriced from what I recall). The broth isn't as flavourful as other joints in Toronto, to the point where the broth can sometimes be watery and bland (the Shio Ramen in particular). Also, I'd pass on the gyoza. I ordered it here once and I couldn't keep it down - there was something about the mix that was really garlicky and off-putting.   Overall, very average meals, and definitely not the best. But if you're craving ramen in the west end, I guess this does the job for now."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen Mississauga does not fail to satisfy your ramen needs! Their ramens are always cooked to perfection and the soup base was great. I had their Miso Ramen with their roasted pork. Though the portions are relatively smaller, this ramen is more of a \"lighter\" dinner so to speak. I would say it is more of a comfortable full type of meal if you are looking to eat something that is not too heavy or costly.  Would recommend to try if you have never been before."}
{"text":"First time at Kenzo Ramen. First time ramen eater. I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend and myself visited this place due to cravings for something hot and salty and new. The menu had a lot of choices, but was not one that stood out that was a must try. We eventually got Tonkotsu Sho-yu Ramen and Netsu Ramen. Oh boy, was it delicious, the noodles was perfectly cook, the soup was flavourful and it was so much for one person to finish. Looking around other tables, there was a lot of half bowl full.  We also tried the gyoza, a chefmade appetizer and not just store bought crap that I guess other restaurant sells. But what do I know, I just eat and gives a thumbs up or down.  Overall, this place was an A+. Friendly service and affordable food that will keep me coming back. However, I will only come here when I'm craving something salty. They have my help getting customers in the door, as I will recommended their good food."}
{"text":"I've been here few times already and will definitely keep coming back. I am in love with their Tonkotsu Ramen (Hakata style pork bone soup ramen). The broth is delicious and the sliced pork meat is the best I've had. I've also tried their Takoyaki (baked octopus ball filled with octopus, green onion, cheese and shrimp flavouring) which were also very good. Too bad that they are not available all the time. Their iced matcha drink is also worth trying.  The portion of the ramen is perfect. Price is good. The line-up seems long but it moves pretty quickly. Make sure to write down your name on the waiting list right beside the door once you come in (yes, you have to write it down yourself). Service is friendly and quick.   My favourite Ramen House so far"}
{"text":"Great place for ramen! The food is awesome and the portions are huge. Took me almost an hour to finish (slow eater here). Servers are extremely welcoming and always smiling and let us take our time to order. Worth the wait in the line, but go earlier in the day to avoid the lineup.  We went back again the next week and the consistency was amazing. They even have options for those who don't like ramen, although I doubt how someone would not like this awesome dish.  Would visit again, anytime!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Kenzo location in North York, but was downtown for the X-mas parade and decided to grab a bite at this location.  This location is a little bigger and can accomadate more people. Washroom was clean and the service was very efficient.  I had the my usual King of Ramen noodles and it was good, but not on par in comparison to the North York location.  Price was similar, but the only beef I had was they charge for tea and the tokaiyoki was not available."}
{"text":"I woke up on Christmas Morning, with a deep craving for Ramen.  We parked the car and were walking towards another Ramen place when we stumbled upon Kenzo Ramen.  Since I was super hungry and couldn't wait to walk over to my original destination, we decided to walk in. I was grateful that they were open on Christmas Day.   HOWEVER, our waitress did not have the best attitude.  I was hoping it was a Japanese owned place, but it was not :(  I was excited to see takoyaki on the menu but when I tried it, I was disappointed.  They used the wrong sauce and mayonnaise ( it may have been just some white sauce and not actual mayonnaise).  But I think if you don't really know what takoyaki is supposed to taste like, you may enjoy it.  Ramen itself, was just around average.  I ordered the Sapporo MIso Ramen.  It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't good.  Will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"With a sudden ramen craving that fell upon me, I decided to check out where the closest ramen joint to my work was with my handy dandy Yelp app. Luckily for me, Kenzo was less than 5 minutes away, hurrah!  You may not notice Kenzo if you're not looking for it, it's easy for smaller spots to get lost in the hustle & bustle of Yonge St, I find!  Service here is easily 5 stars. My waitress was super sweet, attentive, and friendly.  Lots of solo eaters and small tables, so if you are popping by on a quick solo lunch, or even just wandering the area solo looking for a bite to eat, Kenzo is ideal.  I went with the Tonkotsu ramen (which came within MINUTES of me ordering! Wow! Talk about speedy!) which was tasty, though I felt the pork could have used a bit more seasoning.   Minus a few points because a.) I think the floor must have been very recently washed because it was quite wet and I almost slipped walking to my table - no signs warning about this - eep! & b.) Got unlucky with a wobbly table (those drive me bonkers!)  All in all a solid 3.5/5. One of the better lunch spots in the area, not to mention some of the best service. I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"we waited for long time without any service. NO ONE would respond us. We walked out and went to subway. Even Subway is better than this place."}
{"text":"First time ramen eater. Verdict: tasty!  I ordered the King of Kings ramen and the gyoza.  The King of Kings broth had a spicy, pork-meets-fish flavour. The noodles were good, but I actually found them to be the dullest part of the soup. The star was hands-down the pork: both the minced pork in the broth and the sliced pork topping had this incredible smokey flavour that was really unique and delicious.  And the gyoza! Wow! Pork explosion! Probably better than the ramen.  I don't understand why this place gets such negative reviews. If you want good service, don't go to a noodle house."}
{"text":"My friend has been asking me to try Ramen for the longest time, and I kept refusing to get out of my comfort zone. But once I did come to Kenzo.. there was no doubt about how delicious ramen was! :)   I always order the veggie broth ramen with veggies and shrimp in it. The portions are great for the price ($10-12) and some of their apps paid really well with the Ramen too. The only downside is the wait and the waiting area. On some nights you're literally waiting outside the restaurant! Guess it's a way of knowing that it's a popular joint! Definitely recommend this for a night out with friends/family!"}
{"text":"The service here is lacking, and would warrant fewer stars if weren't for the fact that the ramen was actually quite tasty.  My date and I both ordered the King of Kings ramen, and as our first \"fancy\" ramen experience (i.e., not eating out of the pot at home), we were pleasantly surprised. Lots of ingredients, huge portions, and some great flavours going on. I would order it again.  Not anticipating the size of the ramen, we ordered the Okonomiyaki to share (deep fried pancake), but I found it a bit mushy, and quite inferior to Guu's offering of the same.  Service-wise: it took a long time for someone to take our order, a long time for her to return so we could ask for water, and pretty much a long time to get anything accomplished. Especially in such a small restaurant, and when the nature of the food suggests fast turnover, this was pretty frustrating.  I've give this place 2.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Love this place!   I've been craving for ramen and searched on Yelp the best ramen in Mississauga. Did not disappoint me! Service was good. Friendly staff. Parking can be a challenge since it's located alongside busy establishments. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen Japanese Noodle Restaurants is located on the Dundas St Downtown Toronto. The restaurant is famous for Japanese style noodles and all the noodles are freshly made in the restaurant. There are many locations in Toronto.  The one I've been with my boyfriend is on Dundas St. It's a small restaurant. There are two floors of this restaurant. Because we arrived the restaurant right at the dinner time, the restaurant was very busy. We have to wait for while to get into the restaurant. After a few minutes waiting, we got a table upstairs. There were so many people in the restaurant. We quickly sat down and began to look at the menu. The menu is very colorful with images, which is very easy for us to order the food. The servers were very nice and friendly.  They bought the drinks and introduced the menu to us.  My boyfriend and I had Japanese Takoyaki for share. The Takoyaki in Kenzo Ramen is super expensive around $10 per dish, which is more expensive than many restaurants in Vancouver. But, all the Takoyaki ball tasted fresh and lots of seafood inside. I believe that it totally worth the price.  I had Miso Ramen and my boyfriend had Netsu Ramen.  Both ramens were all in the large portions of noodles in soup. The soups tasted very different from each other. The ramen noodles tasted very fresh and soft. The soup very tasty and delicious. It was very awesome dinner for us. I love this restaurant so much. Cheap and Delicious. Highly Recommend to people."}
{"text":"Tried their basic miso ramen and tasted pretty good.  The soup base was flavourful, noodle tasted good and toppings was decent.  My dish came with roasted pork which tasted good but I personally prefer pork belly with my ramen.    Their dumpling was very delicious. It tasted very well with the sauce (I think it's vinegar).   My food experience here was good.  It is a good ramen place but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Five Stars! This is the best Ramen I have had in North America. I wasn't expecting what I got. The noodles were amazing. The broth is spicy and not too salty. It's so hard to find good authentic Ramen and this place has it! I love it! I will eat here whenever, I visit TO!"}
{"text":"I can't help but picture Naruto Uzumaki loving this place! What a fantastic find and one of my now essential places to visit in downtown whenever that happens!   The service is excellent. The food well saying that it's delicious would be an understatement. The goyoza (pork filled dumplings) is def on my absolute fav lists! The ramen is filling, delicious, great size for a person. The menu is enough for most palates.   All in all def a place to go!"}
{"text":"Once again easy 5 stars! I saw this right next to the Canada computers an was like yup.. Dinner is served. Busy just as expected. Had to wait 10 min to get in to give my take out order. Took another 10 to get the order. Netsu Ramen and Gyoza. Packed nicely. Got home still hot.   Tried it... Felt I was back somewhere in food heaven... Came back finished and then took a breath.   Wow. The broth perfect, good amount veggies and chicken. The noodles perfectly cooked.  The Gyoza just as fantastic as I'd hoped.  The portions are fantastic for one person, the prices are decent, food is worth it.   I know for sure it will definitely be a place I'd come through again!"}
{"text":"\"irashaimasen!\" (\"welcome!\"), the hostess modestly yells as she walks you to your table, with the rest of the employees echoing it back as a form of greeting.  notable wooden furniture decorates the space, adding some elegance in contrast to the bustling, casual feel of the restaurant.  the menu lists the usual ramen essentials, such as sho-yu and miso ramen, and some other kenzo specialties such as their spicy features and their \"king of kings\" dish.  i decided to give the karashi ramen a shot, which uses \"japanese karashi hot sauce\" in its broth.  a delicious soup with ample spice level.  i think the best part about kenzo's ramen is that their noodles have this very fun, chewy texture.  i'm also fond of their onigiri, which is covered in a light coating of sesame oil, contributing an extra dimension of flavour and texture.  your choice of salmon, tuna, or chicken filling.  they don't have the greatest ramen, but it's still tasty, affordable, and they have all the basic menu options.  plus points for being mississauga's first real ramen restaurant, as far as i know"}
{"text":"Am not a ramen person but my wife is.  She ordered Shi-O Ramen and I stuck with an onigiri.  My wife swears by her ramen and I enjoyed the tasty onigiri.  Good overall but come prepared to wait.  Location is tiny and there seems to be a line up here no matter what time of the day it is."}
{"text":"The ramen itself is decent, in fact I want to commend them more on their delicious takoyki, which I don't know if it's a good thing considering they are a ramen shop.  I've tried both the shoyu ramen and the spicy challenge ramen and both had very standard broth flavors that did not particularly stand out."}
{"text":"I always liked the King of Kings ramen here. But then a crop of ramen places popped up the last two or three years, and then I didn't go to Kenzo as much as before.   Price wise, it's a little pricy, but the portion is pretty large, so I don't mind the price. There are lots of toppings in the King of Kings as well. I wish it was spicy though.  This is sort of my go to place for ramen because it's not very crowded here. I know I can come in, order, get food, and be in and out in a reasonable time frame. The other reason is that their vegetarian option here is pretty good. Most places don't have a true vegetarian ramen option. Kenzo does! The broth is not made with a pork broth. The veggie ramen here is actually one that I order from time to time as well when I don't want to eat meat.   Despite the plethora of ramen joints available now, I'm glad I have Kenzo around the corner from me."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with my sister. They are busy. Servers are nice. But food is quite disappointing. I got the classics ramen, the portion is small to my surprise . Flavour is quite bland . I ate better ramen before. Maybe I  should give it another try but i am kinda reluctant to try other food if the classic dish is disappointing. On the other hand the  takoyaki is good , not too much batter, light and airy. I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Well this place is good, but I don't understand the high ratings. I found their soup to be slightly salty and the portions somewhat small for the price. But like the other reviews mention, the service was EXCELLENT. Super attentive staff."}
{"text":"This Kenzo location is a compacted hole in the wall. They have a variety of in house made ramen. Oh and some rice dishes, but I don't really eat rice...so yah.   They have dip-able ramen and my fave, a vegetarian ramen. I typically opt out of the fish flakes and tofu. But still have it prepared with oyster sauce. However you can ask for soya sauce instead. Cool huh!   It comes on this sizzling hot plate and your own individual tray and a wooden spoon and nifty chopsticks. Not the disposable kind or pho restaurant ones.   The service is great once your seated. If not be prepared to write your name on a clipboard outside the door and wait for your name to be called.   Oh and gyoza is freakin amazing!! Pricey but soooo worth it.   They also offer take out or pick up...never really had much luck with calling in an order. I just ended up driving from Brampton to Mississauga. But really it's worth it!   If you like noodles or soup OR BOTH, then what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I have a soft spot for Kenzo, as they were the ones that started the whole ramen craze in Toronto. However, it's 2015, and there are more ramen places that have popped up, and sadly Kenzo has not adapted to the new ramen kings such as Kinton, Santouka, and Sansotei. However, I recently decided to come back to Kenzo just to see what the difference in food quality is compared to the big 3 mentioned.  Despite the dip in popularity of Kenzo, weekday lunches are still quite busy in here. You likely won't have to wait for a table similar to Kinton/Sansotei/Santouka, but the price is still full as is. There were a few additional selections since my last adventure at Kenzo, and quite frankly I find Kenzo has quite decent ramen variety compared to the rest.  I ordered the sapporo miso ramen, as I wanted to try something different from the basic miso ramen that I always ordered when I first knew about Kenzo. Personally I found the ingredients and broth to be quite good, but the ramen was definitely subpar compared to the big 3, as I found it to be too overcooked and not very \"spring\"-y or chewy.  Service was excellent and I was attended to the entire time, including consistently filling up the water when needed. Overall it's an okay alternative if you're in a rush but Sansotei is experiencing long lineups, but there was definitely a noticeable quality difference that Kenzo is unable to match."}
{"text":"Actually I will not say it gave me very strong impression. Ramen was average, price was a little high than I expected. Environment is also average. I will not say I recommend or not, but if you walk by and never try it before, then you can give a try."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so fresh and tasty. Service is friendly and fast but be ready to wait for a table as this place is very popular."}
{"text":"It's good ramen. I got the tonkotsu miso. Nothing mind blowing but if you're in sauga and crave that delicious ramen flavour, this place will meet your needs.  Service was kinda slow here tho, and don't expect your water to be refilled proactively."}
{"text":"Ordered the tonkatsu ramen. Nothing out of the ordinary and quite expensive for the received portion. Service was not exactly friendly."}
{"text":"After a long exhausting walk my girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to something special. We decided to give kenzo ramen a try.   We ordered Sho-yu Ra-men (7.95) and The King of Kings Ramen (12.95).  The broth for Sho-yu was nice and tasty and the ramen noodle was made very nicely.  Rather disappointed overall though, The king of kings ramen had a tasteless instant noodle tasting broth. It was as if someone mixed water with chill oil.   The waitresses were leaning on ambivalent about serving us seriously.  Let me assure you downtown has a lot of options, Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I love that we have Ramen noodles in Mississauga! It does get very busy on the weekend. So unfortunately, this is great I can only have during the week. I've only dined in, so cannot speak for take out!"}
{"text":"Ive never eaten in the restaurant but I had this on the weekend for the 5th or 6th time. I get the spicy chicken ramen soup (I think)  I love spicy food, the spicier the better. Need more than one portion of noodles though as there is so much broth. But always handy to keep and add in your own for leftovers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really wish there were half stars for this app (3.5) I ordered the 'Sapporo Miso' on uber eats, everything was HOT and tasty but, they hardly gave you any pork. I mean, I had more 'added' corn than pork but the flavour was still so good as well as the portion size. Just needed double the meat, seriously."}
{"text":"They seriously serve the best gyozas in the city! The gyozas deserve a 5 star rating, their ramen a 3.5. I am an uptown girl, so whenever I make a trip to the Eatons centre I always make time to get my gyoza fix; they are just a few minutes walk from Eatons! Their menu items are also modestly priced."}
{"text":"Well fair price for ramen. Very friendly waitress and fast service! Would recommend this to friends!"}
{"text":"I had the Netsu Ramen with pork for lunch today and overall, it was a very satisfying meal. However, 5 minutes in, I found a piece of wire-like material. I informed one of the servers right away and he did not hesitate to take it back, get me a new order, and apologized for the inconvenience. It even came with large pieces of pork (the soup includes ground pork or chicken only) as well as an egg the second time around! The manager also gave me a 15% off discount for my order which was not expected but definitely appreciated (although my mom said they should not have charged me at all). I also had their matcha shake, which was delicious! Affordable, quick and great customer service but you do get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE their Nagasaki ramen...It's amazing!!!!!!! I always get level 3 spice!! ahhhhh best ramen ever!!! Love everything about this place, staff are always so pleasant and helpful. Another thing worth trying is the salmon onigiri.. you wont regret it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today! Place was pretty small and there was a waiting line... But they do have a signup sheet which is quite efficient! the wait time was not too long! I liked that they had the option for the vegetarian broth but I found that as I got my ramen it wasn't as to what I had anticipated. I expected a richer flavour. The taste of bean sprout was a bit too overwhelming but the chicken they added to the soup was good!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 - It would have been a 4 stars rating but I had to deduct some stars off because I am biased, Sansotei is overall a better Ramen joint and made with more love. The kitchen did add ground pork to my bowl when the menu didn't say there was pork (I can tolerate pork bone broth but I don't eat meat so picking out ground pork would have been insanely tedious. I can easily pick out the roasted pork though).  Basic Ramen Sho-Yu 6.95 Shi-O  6.95 Miso 6.95  Hot Ramen The King of Kings 11.95 Netsu 8.95 Orochong  7.95 Karachi 7.95  Kenzo's highly recommended dishes Tonkotsu Miso 9.95 Tonkotsu Sho-Yu 9.95 Tonkotsu 9.95  There were also Cuisine Ramens ( Nagasaki Champon, seafood noodles, etc.) and side dishes such as the popular Gyoza and Takoyaki.  In short, I didn't love but I also didn't hate my bowl of ramen. I can always eat ramen. The only negative review will be that I had to wait for another bowl of The Kings of Kings Ramen (Spicy Netsu ramen with five toppings of roasted pork, sliced egg, fish cake, fresh seaweed, dried seaweed and marinated bamboo shoot) without ground pork (the kitchen messed up) but the staff was very sweet about it. Selections were broad, something for everyone, including vegetarians. I added extra vegetables and that was $2.00. I tried my date's Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and it was flavourful, milky and rich. I do prefer the noodles and noodle options at Sansotei and hands down, their soft boiled eggs blew Kenzo out of the water.   Parking - street Tea - $1.00/cup Vegetarian options - Available with the basic ramens Business Hours - Daily from 11:00 am - 11:00 pm"}
{"text":"We went a second time and it was amazing! I'm so glad the first time was just a fluke.  The wait was about 15-20 minutes to get in, but we weren't too hungry so we didn't mind. We have been here before and the crowd is out the door, so we just leave.  We got the sapporo miso ramen and the creamy vegetarian ramen. The miso is a very light broth and a lot of veggies and tofu (we asked for it to be added) and the creamy one is a heavier bean broth with less veggies. I really liked both and would get them again.  The waitress didn't ask us for spice level so I guess the default is no spice, which isn't our preference, but it wasn't bad. We both commented how a little bit of spice would make the ramen perfect though.  Overall, I really like this place and it might be our new go-to for something light."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen makes the best ramen in my opinion and it doesnt matter which location you go to! It's always delicious and my favorite item on the menu would be the chicken netsu ramen level 2. It extremely flavourful and always make me feel better especially when I feel cold like symptoms the spiciness from the soup clears it right up! All the Kenzo locations are great!"}
{"text":"This place has great Ramen! I went here never having Ramen before I love it! I order it with ground chicken and ordered it level 2 and it was really spicy and seasoned just right! I will be definitely be trying more ramen places in the future!"}
{"text":"Great food and service... We ordered few sups and octopus appetizer and everything was absolutely amazing.. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Being the only authentic ramen joint in Mississauga his place is usually very packed. We went for Saturday lunch at noon and the wait was only about 5 minutes or so. I had ordered the spicy ramen challenge at $13.95 and received a generous portion of ramen and ground pork. I find the regular orders have a small portion. Service was good.   Would definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"Their choices of soup broth are great, not so much the meats. Overall it was quite decent. The Tonkatsu was great, but the Ji-Sue (i think thats what its called) was terrible...tasted like stirfry. I will definitely come back tho bcuz its local and the service was great. But anyone that says this is better than Kinton downtown knows nothing about Ramen whatsoever"}
{"text":"Great ramen noodle spot with quick turn around time.  Usually very busy so be sure to sign in with your name and number of peeps in your party in the front waiting area.  The restaurant is not too big and is kinda crowdy with seats and tables in close proximity, so keep that in mind with larger parties.  The food is great, wide selection and everything is made to order, select from veg, pork or chicken broths and what toppings you want.  A lot of great appetizers also!"}
{"text":"This place is literally up the street from where I live, yet today was my first visit!  I wasn't impressed with Momofuku, so I thought it was hype.  Besides, this place is always busy and I'm not one to line up for food...unless it's free!  ;)  Impressions?  I'm not a huge ramen person, but I've had better in Vancouver.  I also ordered the wrong thing, so that didn't really help my impression.  I initially ordered the Ji Su Ramen ($11), with a soy sauce based soup w/ an egg broken into the broth, pieces of chicken, & sesame oil.  Soup was more like a gravy, so it was a bit too rich for my liking.  I ended up swapping for the Sapporo Miso Ramen (~$11) which had SOO much bean sprouts.  Sprouts/pieces of nappa definitely outweighed the noodles, so that wasn't good.  Both soups were piping hot, so that was good.  A bit on the salty side, especially the bowl of Ji Su.  Service was friendly and fairly efficient.  Not bad, but didn't really live up to the hype.  However, I wouldn't be opposed to going back to try another dish.    And yes, there was a wait for a table, but it moved fairly quickly.  I also came on Saturday evening for dinner and again, there was also a line, so I went elsewhere.  Seems to be always a wait during peak times."}
{"text":"Oh oh, I'm gonna get it from this crowd, I can tell!    I've only ever gone right at opening time, or later in the afternoon.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, and the staff weren't on a dinner break.  Service was prompt, but not too friendly.  Just \"sit down, order, and get out\" kind of service.  But I've come to expect that from many restaurants in this city.  I thought the food was grand.  I love a good bowl of soup!  I really like the packages of flavoured rice they serve (onigiri).  Filling.  Price was good, service was certainly acceptable, bathroom was cleaner than most downtown.    So I liked it.  Wanna fight!?!?!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed myself thoroughly! Waitress was very kind, not much interaction though which was fine. Ramen was tasty but subtle. They were nice enough to give me a side of minced chilli to put into my bowl for some heat. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times now and have to say that I'm quite pleased with the food. I can only speak of my experience a couple days ago, since that's what's still fresh in memory.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and was pleasantly surprised to find how well balanced it was in seasoning. I was mostly afraid of it being over salted. Unfortunately, the egg was a little more well-done than I would have liked.   We also ordered the gyoza and takoyaki as appetizers. The gyoza was seasoned well and had great flavor when paired with the sauce. The takoyaki was okay, but I wish there wasn't so plain, even with the sauce and bonito flakes.  While we did go during peak lunch time, one person in our group did wait significantly longer for his food than the rest of us.   All in all, great ramen without having to drive to travel through traffic for Toronto. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Simply the BEST ramen in town and gyoza was delicious too!  I'm just not a fan of the place. It's quite an uncomfortable awkward narrow place so may not work if you have a big group.   But I would still go back for some awesome ramen."}
{"text":"I love Ramen, I've done a few reviews on several ramen places and so there's a certain expectation I have when I come in to get a bowl of ramen.  Being one who lives in Mississauga, I had to try out the one and only ramen place.  Few years back, I went to the downtown location and had mixed reviews with it.  And sadly, that's the same thing I've experienced recently.  Before I begin, I genuinely want Kenzo to succeed especially when they are the first ones to break into Mississauga.  So I'm hoping that the owners read this and take some the criticisms to improve their business.  So décor wise, it's very unimpressive, almost feels like they just took the old place, put some tables, added a couple of Japanese props and bam, along came the ramen place.  Not much they can do about this, but I have to address, as ramen places in general have invested just as much $ into the décor as they have in the food.  Service is fine.  That's really Kenzo's high point, as it was pretty fast, attentive and they were welcoming when you came in and when you left the place.  It pains me to award a low review for a place that had relatively good service.  So the food.  This is where Kenzo completely missed the mark on a lot of things.  The menu for one, didn't offer more than...10-12 ramen bowls, with 2 appetizers (one of them being crossed off).  Also, the menu I got was in pretty bad condition, ripped and looked like soup was accidently dumped on it.  It kind of bugged me that the menu had so little choice, and didn't offer up options to add corn, an egg or any form of extra garnishes.  It was pretty much \"you get what you see\".  As for the actual dish, which was the Shi-o Ramen, first off, the bowl was PUNY.  It reminded of the small bowls that I would get at Pho.  This puny bowl is $8, which I guess is cheaper but my goodness, there was absolutely very little in my bowl.  Ramen noodles, two slices of pork, some green onions and 3 slices of bamboo shoot.  The ramen noodles were fine, soup was overly salted imo and pork was surprisingly bland.  I finished my bowl in literally 5-10 minutes and found myself going elsewhere to get a snack to fill me up (yes, I could have gotten gyoza but in all honesty, by this point, I had just given up).  Having said all this, I want Kenzo to realize that there is a considerably amount of areas that need improvement before I can even think of revisiting the place.  Take this review in good stride."}
{"text":"The Kenzo chain in general is \"OK\". Don't let that deter you, I don't mean to attach any negative connotations with \"OK\", I really really just mean it's OK. Considering ramen options in Toronto in general, it's pretty good.  I like the atmosphere of this Kenzo a little more than the other ones. It's easier to be seen by waiters than the one on Dundas and it feels less gaudy than the one on Bloor. Every time I've been there it's also been quieter, with parties usually from 1~4 people. This might be why the waitresses are sometimes distracted talking to each other though, and they don't notice if you're looking expectantly their way with your meal done right away.  I usually just opt for their more basic ramens. My main complaint about Kenzo ramen is it's got too much going on. Too many bean sprouts, too much saltiness to the broth, etc. I can't taste that hearty pork bone flavour in the tonkotsu ramen as well as at J-Town because of this. As a solution I always order shoyu or shio ramen and water down the broth with some water.  If you're a ramen newbie, don't worry, the food is still pretty good. If you're picky about your ramen, you may not be too impressed by Kenzo, but it's not too bad, especially when you're really craving some ramen."}
{"text":"The ramen here is not bad. I like the King of Kings.  Had one of the green tea drinks, but it was not that good. Would recommend that you stick to the ramen."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go here by a friend who enjoys it here.   They have several locations so I am going to go on the assumption that quality may vary based on where you are. I'm going to flat out say that I did enjoy my experience here and I really did enjoy it. I had more than enough food at my disposal and I left a full man upon completion of my meal. I think the pricing is on point, any more would be theft and any less....would also be theft come to think of it.  It was a bit grungy but there isn't anything wrong with that if you can get past it and the food is great. What I really liked about it was that there is a heavy emphasis on vegetarian options that are available which is great! It's rare to see in a ramen place which focuses typically on pork, chicken and beef broths.   I do reccomend this place to all. There are better ramen joints in the city for sure, but this is DEFINITELY one of the better places for sure"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! The gyozas were RAW!!!! They reheated it but not enough!! We had a few bites of literally raw pork before realizing it was not cooked through. The server took it back and just gave us a short apology and a can of pop!!! No sincerity at all! Of course we didn't take their stupid pop.   Also ramen itself is below mediocre. Also not boiling hot but at least \"cooked\". Yes that is the only expectation of this place..."}
{"text":"Very simple menu, food quality is fairly good and very authentic. Very small place, so expect long wait at rush hours. We were here just before the rush, so seating was not an issue (just a two minutes wait). They had three servers, but only two of them came to the front, and, so, consider all of our food arrived before we got our water did make us feel they are understaffed for such a small place."}
{"text":"Broth is very nice (though a tad salty in my opinion). Noodles aren't chewy enough for my taste but still good. Meat and vegetables and such are pretty good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Ramen places in Mississauga hands down!!! Everything is on point here to compete with Toronto Ramen spots.   If you don't want to drive downtown hit up this local spot for some good eats. Enjoy"}
{"text":"as many people are saying, regardless of how the ramen is, its the ONLY place in Mississauga, so people are going to keep going when they want their ramen fix. that being said I didn't mind the more bland broth as it made for a lighter meal. the biggest problem I had was we sat under the ceiling air and condensation dropped into my drink AND my ramen... I kept eating it because I paid for it, but was worried the germy dirty metal ceiling might have made me sick later... all good! (nothing moving the table around wouldn't fix)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place. It's his go to gyudon place. He loves their beef rice. I find their beef rice pretty good but sometimes there isn't enough sauce so the rice is sometimes a little bland. We always order two extra eggs on top of the rice but the servers always end up forgetting to add them.   I find the ramen dishes decent. They aren't as good as the ones downtown. They are on the saltier side. So if you don't like food that's too salty, make sure you tell the server to make it less salty.    I always order the salmon oniguri here. Love it. But at times, the rice is a little hard and not as fresh.   Overall a decent place."}
{"text":"Inside was busy but we got seated quickly, although non booth seating was 'cozy' with other customers. Had the Nagasaki Champon. Broth had a nice mild flavour. Nothing too special to say about it. Perfectly adequate and I ate the whole thing. Asked for something to add more heat and at first waiter brought over a bottle of Sriracha. When asked for something spicier than Sriracha, waiter brought over diced red chiles which made the meal significantly better for my palate. There are loads of ramen options downtown so if you are not picky, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Kenzo is a terrible restaurant selling decent ramen.  The service here is horrible: slow, inattentive, and rude.  The ramen I had (King of Kings) was rather tasty, but nothing exceptional.  If that exact ramen had been served in a nicer setting by nicer people then it may have been tastier, but the obvious fault (which is shared by most restaurants in Toronto) is the low freshness level of the ingredients.  If the service had been passable then I would consider stopping by here again to get my occasional ramen fix, but as it is I'll never go back unless I'm stuck in this part of town with a ramen craving."}
{"text":"I can't imagine why this place ever got a less than great review! Maybe I'm too generous, but I like balance with a splash of miso.  We had the shi-o and the shi-yu ramen, side of karrage and pork soboro and we weren't the least bit disappointed.    Good portion size for price, great service, and how refreshing to see young chefs perfecting their craft!   Salt? Well, a bit of history into ramen will give you insight... Daily nutritional value? The Japanese survived and thrived centuries eating this same stuff.  Throw out the calorie counter for a night and have a beautifully and care-fully prepared meal.  I'll be back- have to try all the different soup bases! Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Better than I expected. After reading all the neg yelp reviews I was a bit nervous. Chowhownds gave it the best ramen in Toronto vote so I had to give it a try.  Now I'm no ramen expert, but I did live in japan for a while. My ultimate ramen is ippudo in NYC.  First, yea this is a Korean place, the Japanese in the walls is a bit off at times. If this is going to ruin your visit, go elsewhere.  The service was perfectly adequate and no frills. The waitress was fast and efficient with few words. There were no problems with the bill. I got my beer.  I had a beer, takoyaki (fried octopus balls, or balls o octopus) and the king ramen which is one of their spicy choices.  Takoyaki was a bit on the undercooked side (although I can't honestly remember how undercooked it came in japan) but very good.   The ramen came in about 5 minutes and, surprise, it was really pretty amazing. Perfect fatty slices of pork, ground spicy pork (I think) nori, komoboko and bean sprouts. The noodles were not mushy but the standard al dente yellow fresh ramen noodles you expect from a good ramen shop. The broth was fiery red but not too hot (although for me hot is a broth with 10 chilis floating around the bowl) not really purely Japanese but this is not a Korean champon either.  All in all a very good bowl of ramen. They have tonkotsu ramen as well now, will give it a try next time."}
{"text":"Service is ok. They've finally decided to add some kind of system to keep track of guests & who is next in line - it's writing on a piece of paper on the wall, it's not the best but it keeps some order. I have ordered two different broth ramen bowls already & the roasted pork is delicious. They now also serve gyoza. Just don't expect some of the servers to be friendly."}
{"text":"I agree with many reviews, they have horrible service. Waitress are unfriendly, and food is so so. They need to give customer a complete experience.   Food is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Average ramen. Doubt you can find better places in Mississauga, but pales in comparison to Toronto ramen."}
{"text":"Had the shiyu ramen with a side...brilliant and the broth was perfect...couldn't as for more!"}
{"text":"Oh me oh my !!!   I was a ramen virgin, unless you count instant noodles, which I don't. Kenzie took my ramen virginity.   In all honesty I have not much to compare Kenzo too, and I am no ramen expert, but I must say I absolutely loved it !   The soup was filled with plenty of flavour, if only I could pronounce the name( so I won't try) the Gyoza I had was better then any gyoza I've tasted, so I would definitely recommend getting that on the side to share while you have your ramen soup.   The service was great, they were friendly and kept checking up, refilling our water and they were super friendly.   9/10 in my books only because I feel like they need a bigger space to accommodate their clientele :)"}
{"text":"yah... all of the above.  good ramen.  poor service."}
{"text":"The waitress messed up one of our order. For noodle, one of my friends asked for more soup because it is a little dry. The waitress came back and said that the extra soup for noodle is extra $5 charges which is unbelievable."}
{"text":"I went there with my bf out of curiosity. Heard a lot about the chain and to be fair, I don't expect a whole lot after reading reviews and eating ramen at other places in Toronto (Sansotei, Santouka, Nobuya, Kinton, Toubouken and Rajin Ramen).  I ordered the Tonkatsu Miso Ramen while my bf ordered the king of kings ramen. I found my Tonkatsu Miso ramen to be decent. I should not have drank much of the broth as I was REALLY thirsty for a while and needed water. Rarely have this problem in the places I tried above. Bf did not enjoy the king of kings ramen as he didn't like the broth and its overall execution. He also felt it wasn't like a traditional Japanese ramen bowl despite many toppings. I mean, he was surprised at the ground pork and kimchi there. He found my broth to be fine though.  Perhaps it's me and my bf's preference, but we weren't expecting that much beansprouts and very thin noodles (well, based on the thicker noodles we are used to from other places).  Service is fine given the limited space and growing number of clients (we came at 11ish opening time and left at around 11:55).  Overall 3/5 stars, which I feel is justified. Won't mind trying this chain again in Mississauga or Toronto but it's not a place we would go out of our way for lunch or supper. Bf intends to try a more \"traditional\" Japanese ramen bowl there next time. For me, I probably may give shio a shot along with the takoyaki. Those look huge!"}
{"text":"Good solid ramen on Queen West. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. Would return if I was looking for good noodles and didn't want to travel to find them."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen is the same as the Japanese Noodle House Chain.  I tried the Sapporo Miso Ramen at $10.95.  The description of the dish is very accurate.  The dish consisted of very rich miso soup base with mixed stir fried veggies. There is a choice of pork or chicken slices as well as a vegetarian option.  I chose chicken and was very pleased.  I went at lunch time just at opening.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely return to try the other ramen dishes especially in the winter or any time I need a rich hot soup to warm the insides."}
{"text":"This place is located on the south/west corner of Mavis and Burhamthrope... in a plaza strip.  I drove past it the first time... so though this tip would help others out.  The place is very small and limted seating. I find that the waitress is not very attentive.  There is a prep kitchen that is an open concept... to finalize the toppings ordered... which I thought was neat.  They work very fast behind the counter.  No portions counted/weighed... they just eyeball everything.  With that said... the noodle soup is good.   But I did not find it was worth the hype."}
{"text":"I ordered tonkatsu don and agedashi tofu. Felt like eating rice instead of ramen today   Food : 4/5  It's pretty good and decent, the portion is fairly medium.   Service: 5/5  Everything came fairly quick, and all the staff are responsive.   Price: 3/5  I think the tonkatsu don is a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Ordered: large Shio Ramen with marinated rice.   Price: 4/5 - Cheapest of all the ramen places   Food 3/5 - not much to it   Service 3/5 - not that responsive not enough employees in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great Japanese noodles but we noticed that when they first opened the portions were much larger.  The size of the noodle dishes requires two of us to order 3 dishes due to the small portions.  Soup and noodles are very tasty though!"}
{"text":"It's great. It's ramen is about average! Not disappoint at all, but not surprising as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place thus so far. It's just too bad it was not closer to home.   We came here because I had to check out the ramen scene in Ontario.   Most of the ramen at Kenzo is under $11. Which in my book is awesome and the portions are huge! Which is even better.   They make their own broth, noodles, gyoza, etc. That is what it said on their wall.   I ordered the Ji Su Ramen which is a soy sauce base soup combined with chicken, eggs and sesame oil. Mixed with stir fried vegetables. Let's just say it was DELICIOUS. The soup was so smooth because of the eggs running around in it. The eggs are running throughout the soup so it looks like...egg drop soup.   There are popular places in NYC where the broth is soooooo salty that it's inedible and hurts my lips when the soup touches my lips. It's not like that at all at Kenzo. The saltiness of the soup/broth is the first thing I will observe. I did not find the soup overly salty at all at Kenzo, it was perfect.   I still think about the bowl of ramen that I had at Kenzo, it was that good.   The service was indifferent but it's in line with other ramen places. I was not at Kenzo for service, I was there for their ramen.   The appetizers are a bit more expensive than even NYC. We enjoyed their takoyaki very much, much more than most places in NYC.   Why does Kenzo have to be so far from home?! I miss you Kenzo!"}
{"text":"This location on Burnhamthorpe and Mavis is always super busy, especially during lunch, and with good reason:  the food is consistently good, and the servers are always super cheerful and efficient. I love the Jisumen here, and also the onigiri. I haven't tried the other dishes but was told that they're good too. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is not a very authentic restaurant, although everything is made fresh I was not that impressed with the food , I thought the soups could of had more noodles , the soy sauce was not original it was flavoured with something being Japanese I wasn't keen on it I grew up on kikoman original brewed soy sauce and Sapporo ichiban ramen soup which is an original soy sauce based soup this place does not compare"}
{"text":"Tried Kenzo for the first time yesterday. Went to the 522 Yonge location.   There was no lineup at 5:15 pm (yay!). Had the miso based Ramen. It was good. The broth was delicious and the pork was very good.   I will definitely go back and try the other varities.  I was so happy to see that every other patron in the restaurant was Japanese or Korean. So I am taking that as a sign of authenticity."}
{"text":"From Hamilton or the boonies? Shotty ramen restaurants in town? Go to Mississauga for Kenzo Ramen. Actually taste good. Hell, I am going to quote J T down there because he described it perfectly.   \"The broth is flavorful, the noodles are just the right chewiness and the sides are made just right.\"  Why the two stars then? One for the ramen actually being good and the second for having a spotless inspection from the health inspectors. Educate yourselves with the public health in restaurants, because I am now including it in all of my reviews.   https://healthinspectionspeel.hedgerowsoftware.com/Facility/Details/8dd985ee-b547-4d05-81d7-270433723287  Where are the other three stars??? Well, I don't eat spicy food and had challenged my friend to their hottest \"level 3\" soup. I managed to complete it in record time and also destroying my friend in the process. I also had a trip down to the States two days later which my stomach didn't handle the spice well.  The manager said they would put a photo of us in their hall of fame wall, but we found out two weeks later it wasn't up. All that pain and suffering for nothing. Granted I can just pick one of the hall of famers off the wall since we all look-alike, but that is not the point.  I am a man that goes by trust and integrity. When you say you will do something I expect and hold you by your word. You have severed my trust in any future challenges, but I will eat the regular ramen.  Contact me if you wish to make amends. I will come by for a photo re-take. ^____^  CT"}
{"text":"-1 for long line ups especially on evenings and weekends. It's crazy.  Other than that, ramen is great. Nothing really to compare to since this is the only ramen place we know in Sauga.   Loved their SALMON ONIGIRI ($3.95) Kept ordering either Tonkotsu Ramen ($10.95) and Ka rashi Ramen ($8.95)  Servers are very friendly. We were all greeted by staffs when we come in and also when we left."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. The first was over a year ago. I actually came when I could get a table and loved the food.   I have been craving ramen these days. I decided to return. With Goodwill closed next door, I didn't have to park at the back. However, the place was packed at 3 pm!  I could have signed up for a table after you get through the first set of doors. Instead, I decided to go in and order takeout. I was immediately assisted. The friendly server handed me a menu.   I ordered the shoyu ramen and three-piece gyoza. I then went to the waiting area (there are benches between the two sets of doors) and sat there. The area is pretty small. At one point, fifteen of us were there. The congestion quickly cleared up.   The server said that my order would take 10 - 15 minutes. She was accurate! Yumminess came and I was happy.   The first time I was there, I got the miso ramen. I liked it better than the shoyu. I ordered extra corn, which helped!  The gyoza was excellent. Great size, taste, and crispness.   I'm glad that I tried takeout. Even the ramen presentation was perfect. I will do it again and revert to ordering my beloved miso ramen.   If you are a protein person, I'd recommend ordering more pork. You only get a couple of slices with the shoyu ramen."}
{"text":"The only ramen place i go to in Mississauga. It does get crowded at night and you ll have to write ur name down on the list to get a table. Otherwise, its pretty quite at other times. Never had to wait too long.   Their menu doesnt carry a huge selection. But good enough. And theyve added rice dishes in there too. Their ramen is pretty good. All my friends love it. Havent tried their rich dishes, but after reading the reviews on here, i might do so next time i visit!   Tried their salmon oniguri for the first time. Its a rice ball wrapped with seaweed and stuff with salmon inside. They also provided these finger gloves for you to eat it with. I thought it was really cute.   Overall good experience every time i visit. My go to ramen place in sauga!"}
{"text":"Being in the Yonge-Dundas Square area yesterday, ramen comes to mind.  We were hoping to try Sansotei but as usual there is a line up outside.  We decided not to wait and I knew there were a few more ramen places so we went next over to Kenzo across the street to see if they had a table.  It was packed as well but luckily a table for 3 just opened up.  This was our first time at this Kenzo location.  I still remember when my husband and I looked very hard for ramen places 10 years ago and Kenzo at the Yonge and Steeles location was one of the few traditional ramen shops around at that time.  Now, there are ramen shops everywhere.  We got the Shoyu ramen and the Tonkotsu ramen.  Both were good but nothing too special.  The regular size has a decent portion but you may want upsize for extra $1 for more noodles.  What really stand out was the gyoza (pan fried dumplings).  These were delicious!  I would come back just for the gyoza.  I wasn't even going to order it as $8.95 for 6 pieces was a little pricey but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Been a while since I had Japanese food that wasn't sushi. Also been a while since I've had anything spicy. I fixed both those issues at once with this place. Reasonably price with very friendly and kind hearted staff that create some of the best Ramen this side of the Pacific.   I had the spicy bowl and they have three levels of spice. I chose the lowest one and was still sweating by the time I was done though I did have some level 2 as dipping on the side. Keep in mind I am a lightweight when it comes to spicy food right now.   They have about 20 or so different dishes, mostly in the ramen soup variety. Either spicy or non, also vegi is available for most. They have non bowls as well I didn't have them so don't know how they stack up."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location of Kenzo (been to the one downtown) and we were very happy with our meal.  The servers greeted us and seated us immediately. They brought us glasses of water (surprised that it wasn't tea) and our menus right away.    The restaurant was about 3/4 full at not quite noon on a Saturday (first time we've seen it without a lineup).  We ordered the Sapporo Miso Ramen with pork and the Tonkotsu Ramen. They both arrived incredibly quickly. I think we waited maybe 3 minutes after ordering!!  They were piping hot and so tasty. The Sapporo Miso Ramen had plenty of veggies (cabbage, baby bok choy, bean sprouts) and lots of ground pork. The broth had an almost smoky quality to it and was very rich. The Tonkostu Ramen also had a very rich broth (without the smokiness) and plenty of pork, naruto slices, bok choy and a nice, softly boiled egg-half.  The bowl of Sapporo Miso Ramen was quite a bit larger than the other one, I think because it had quite a few more veggies in it. Both were delicious and the noodles in both were silky and slightly al-dente. But for my money, the Sapporo was the best because that smoky quality just gave it a little something special.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Raman soup base doesn't taste good. It's the soul of the Raman, when it's not good the whole Raman is ruined.  Have to come here because the other Raman place down the street has a long lineup."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff was extremely friendly, the portions are HUGE, and the food is great! The only things I didn't like were that the place is really, really small, and the tables are close together. We were sat next to a woman folding the dumplings, and it wasn't really an issue but it was somewhat weird? Either way, I love this place and I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We have been wanted to try Kenzo for months now, but every time we pass there is always a line up out the door. This past weekend we happened to be driving by just at opening time so we dropped in for a bowl.   We were seated immediately, forgoing what looked like an interesting \"waiting list\" clipboard system. I guess it is something to note for future visits.  The menu had less than 20 things to order, yet I still had a hard time deciding. As this was my first ramen experience, I was completely uninitiated. My general noodle in broth preference is Pho. Ramen is very different than Pho.  I decided on the King of Kings bowl which was literally topped with everything. It was pretty good overall. Not sure if it was $14 pretty good, but tasty nonetheless.  The service was highly efficient where servers were almost running from task to task. Obviously having been trained to move customers through as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Craving ramen for awhile since its hard for me to get good ramen in town. First stop visiting downtown Toronto was Kenzo Ramen. To be fair, from the outside it resembles any other ordinary ramen shop lined along Dundas Ave. While not completely Japanese owned, this place is able to hold its own and have a loyal fan base.   I ordered the Tonkotsu, Broth was tasty and delicious, not to mention healthy. No MSG from what I can tell, noodles were firmly cooked, not too soft or mushy. Portions were just right, satisfying and filling but not overly wasteful in portion wise. Would recommend going back."}
{"text":"Kenzo at this location was very average.  There was nothing exciting, including the side dishes (takoyaki & gyoza).    There's almost always a line-up as they only have 5 or 6 tables that seat 4.  Better ramen for better prices along the Dundas St."}
{"text":"it takes talent to have service this bad.  I walked in one evening thinking I could satisfy my ramen cravings. I came at the wrong time. All the employees at the restaurant were busy having dinner... they glanced at me as if I interrupted their meal. When one guy finally got up to seat us, he kindly asked us to wait 10 minutes so that he and his colleagues can finish their meal first. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  There's really no other way to describe it. The service was average... I went at night time and seated myself. Ordered some spicy ramen noodle and it was spicy, but bland at the same time... I don't even know how that's possible.Some of the chunks of pork in my soup were a bit pink. For $8.99 (tax included), I don't think it was worth it, although it filled me up, but I could get pho for less and leave more satisfied and still have leftover change for a small ice cap."}
{"text":"I dined here with my boyfriend once and it was OK. The worst part about dining downtown Toronto is that either there is complimentary parking or there isn't. The atmosphere was loud but at an average volume. The food was decent but I've tasted better ramen. Not sure if we'll be dining there again though. I recommend this place if you wanna try a different side to ramen dishes. If that even made sense."}
{"text":"Came back, same salty/nauseous feeling. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"}
{"text":"Long story short: Koreans trying to do Japanese specialty food.  Someone said, 'it does the job, but that's about it'. I couldn't agree more.   Ordered: Gyoza, Tonkotsu Ramen, Okonomiyaki  Gyoza: good- no complaints.  Okonomiyaki: (my fiancee ordered it) - she said it was a bit too sweet (I agree), and I thought it was a bit too floury- not flaky at all, perhaps undercooked. I do better when I'm allowed to cook it on my table.  Tonkotsu: the broth was good, but that's where it ended. The noodles were standard egg noodles, not katai (crunchy) at all, not yet mushy, but very buttery. Ingredients were horrible. The standard half egg, with some bean sprouts, a bit of bok choy, one little fishcake and about 3 slivers of red ginger. BORING! Oh, and I think I saw one lone bamboo shoot. No nori, no sesame seed, I don't even remember if there was cabbage.  Price: with one small beer and a chu-hai drink: $45  Bottom line: if you're craving, I guess it's okay to stop in- like I said, I can't find any Tonkotsu (home-made, not frozen) in DC, and I'd rather have this than nothing- but I wasn't very impressed. Whoever said that this was better than Ippudo in New York is off their zabuton! Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation / date night.  First, get there early, they have a sign up sheet outside. There was a line-up... and it was middle of the week!  Once we got in, staff was friendly and kind. They sat us promptly and got us water too. Place felt like a madhouse, but an organized one. They have everything downpat. Atmosphere feels authentic which is awesome.  The gauzo was awesome and i was drooling afterwards. I could sit there and eat that all day. But I also had the raman noodle cause it was recommended. I had a spicy raman (second from the top in the menu) and it was do good.... I think I might go there this week... damn you yelp, you made me hungry again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The wait is always long but they have an effective system where you come in a write your name so you always know where you are in the line.  We got the gowza and I got the netsu Ramen with chicken. This is my favourite bcuz it's a huge portion and had a ton of vegetables. Sooo good"}
{"text":"They were among the first to open ramen places in GTA, thus deserve some stars.  Gyozas are to avoid, fat, huge, heavy, not particularly good. Takoyaki are too spongy and smoochy.  Basic miso ramen are ok... now that concurrent ramen places are spreading all over GTA like mushrooms, they should work on further improving and refining quality."}
{"text":"It's good salty Ramen but as a meal you should order 2 bowls because its basically all noodles and very little meat or veggies.  There is so much salt that I taste it in my mouth for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Loved the short yet simply menu as it made it very easy for me to select a ramen bowl. Staff worked very efficiently which is a HUGE PLUS, if you're trying to get in and out ASAP."}
{"text":"Nice soup, service is not sparkling but fair. Small portion, but can be justified by the price. Expect lineups during lunch time on weekdays."}
{"text":"I love everything ramen especially on a cold day.  Ramen has lots of flavour and is anything but ordinary.  Love their takoyaki definitely recommend anyone who goes there to order it! Their gyoza is delicious too.  Service was amazing, the waitress answered all of our questions  and gave us recommendations that fit our taste buds.  Wish they had more ramen spots in mississauga as this is the only one that I know of and it gets pretty busy.  The waiting time to be seated can be up to 1/2/hour - hour which can really suck if you're really hungry and craving ramen. That's the only downfall :("}
{"text":"I do love this place. In fact, I loved it so much the first time I came here, I suggested that we come back again the next day with a different group of people.  The Netsu and Tonkotsu ramen I tried were so delicious that even though I wasn't hungry, I ate the full thing anyway, AND drank all the soup.  The unfortunate thing about this place is how small it is. If you have a big group, the wait time could be very long, and you may have to wait outside in the cold. Otherwise, it's definitely my go-to place for noodles. Yum!"}
{"text":"The ramen is so good. I tried a couple of other well rated ramen places in Toronto but still enjoy this restaurant the most. Too bad the wait is so long. Best time to go is probably weekday lunch."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated   1. The broth isn't bad but isn't spectacular either and is hurt by the insane amount of sodium that had to be present.  In all fairness, though, this seems to be a standard in the industry.  2. There isn't any indications on their menu what adding extras would cost: ie. meat, an egg, etc..  Whatever, figured it can't be that bad.  Asked for an extra egg.  Apparently they work in halves because I received half an egg and it cost $2.00!    3. The portion of meat to noodle with respect to price is sadly lacking substance.  There was 4 slices of think pork meat.  Halfway through eating you're thinking to yourself, \"where did all my pork go?\"....  Anyhow, if you're in the mood for ramen this place could fill that craving but mostly because choice is limited in the area.    If what you are wanting is soup + noodle + meat, you're better off grabbing some pho.    At $10.95 (this is PRE-Half Egg price) for a bowl of ramen, you often leave this joint with an empty feeling of wishing you didn't crave ramen 30 minutes earlier."}
{"text":"Such an amazing little hole in the wall place. So glad they're franchising out in other places as well. My favourite is the Sapporo Ramen, the miso broth and the stir fried vegetables are to die for."}
{"text":"Ramen for less than $10? This is definitely the option for it. There are a few options under $10 here, like the Miso Ramen (7.95), the Shoyu ramen (7.95), and some of the spicy rames that for 8.95. So if you're craving ramen and not too picky of the taste, not a bad choice.  I picked the Miso ramen, and it was quite meh. The broth is fine, the noodles are fine, the meat was fine. Nothing was \"bad\" but I don't come for ramen to feel \"fine\". The ramen comes with 3 pieces of pork, a piece of seaweed, and a little bunch of bean sprouts. I kept thinking....where's my egg!  My BF ordered the dippable ramen, which was much better. I think it was about $12.95? But the dipping sauce was delicious, and came with the half egg, and a more flavourful pork than mine. I ended up stealing some of his dipping sauce to upgrade my ramen a bit.  All in all....everything is fine. But for better ramen (albeit more expensive), there's some only steps away up and down Yonge St."}
{"text":"Keeping it simple: The way good ramen should be.  Ramen noodle houses have become somewhat of a successful trend in Vancouver, and I've tried my fair share.  Having just moved to Toronto, I was glad to find Kenzo and get my \"fix\"!  I consider myself spoiled in this area, and so, while I can say that I've had better, I found myself thoroughly satisfied with my dinner at Kenzo. I had the Mi-so Ramen, and noted: - the broth was quite rich, but not overly so.  If you tend to like your broth less salty, my dad recommends the Sho-yu - pork was delicious - noodle to soup ratio was excellent (this is VERY important!  I tend to need a lot of soup to my noodles, and there is nothing more frustrating than trying to \"ration\" your soup for the latter half of your dinner)  The service was quick - which I will give them a big thumbs up for.  A moderate thumbs down to how rushed the initial wait staff made us feel.  We had barely sat for 2 minutes when the waitress came over and demanded our order!  She seemed peeved we weren't ready.  She was back 1 minute later.  We stood our ground and apologized, but we needed more time.  Frustrated, she left and we never saw her again.  In her place, a much more patient young man became our waiter.  You could tell that he was probably fighting the urge to hurry us along and out as well, but fight it he did, and my friend and I passed a pleasant evening together.  They were out of the gyoza when we were there (very popular!), and while our replacement takoyaki was yummy (light, and creamy with just a tad too much sauce) - I'm going to come back GMG (get my gyoza)!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I have to say I really like this place.   We had to wait outside for awhile till we could be seated, since the place is so small.  But the amazing service more than made up for the wait.   We were even given complimentary Gyoza!  As for the Ramen I really enjoyed it even though the level 3 spice level wasn't really spicy at all.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood to have Ramen."}
{"text":"this place is A-ok if you need a quick fix for ramen but after eating ramen at dojo in san francisco where people take home their leftover broth and the restaurant runs out of ramen before they even close, its really an unfair advantage to compare the two.   the hot sauce is rediculously hot here so id stay with medium. also these portions are massive. a good amount of seating and friendly service."}
{"text":"Very good ramen! First time at this restaurant in Toronto, ON, Visiting from Phiadelphia PA. Love this place. Love Toronto."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Kenzo ramen - we had to wait a little bit before we got in. There's a sign up sheet to write the names near the entrance. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen while my friend got the seafood ramen. It was pretty good, the soup was a bit too salty. The ramen were good though. My friend seemed to have enjoyed the seafood ramen - it was great for her because Kenzo was able to switch the soup base for the vegetarian broth for her. The service was decent, average. I would come back but try something else next time."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here tonight after walking around aimlessly looking for a place to eat! I live around the area and did not even know this place existed along Yonge Street! I had the sho-yu ramen and it tasted great, it wasn't too salty, it was just right. The customer service wasn't the best but I'll give the guy a break as he was the only server. Prices are pretty reasonable, my ramen was $7.95!"}
{"text":"Can I get some service please?  Pretty please?  I just want some noodles...  ...and maybe an iced tea?   Clearly I was asking too much.  The Yelpers that came late (after we had ordered) got their food before I did.  Either the waitress forgot or something happened in the kitchen.  I can understand this as these things happen sometimes, especially at new places, BUT there was no apology, no discount, no free desert, nothing to say \"I'm sorry you had to watch everyone else eat because we forgot about you\".    If I had gotten an apology or something I would have given this place 4 stars because when I actually did get my food it was probably the best noodle dish I've had in Toronto.  The cash only thing is a little annoying.  Luckily the moon and the stars were in alignment and I just happened to have cash on me."}
{"text":"Came upon this place by accident, as I was visiting 401 Games located next door, and decided to give it a try.  Overall I would say this place is a fairly standard when it comes to ramen; the pork was tender, the egg was not overcooked, the noodles were nice and chewy.  I had their King of Kings ramen and the broth was flavourful but missing that depth and richness you get from a really good broth, but again it was overall decent - the ramen itself also had lots of other stuff in it as well (veggies, seaweed, ground pork). The service was quick and friendly, although I was one of two tables eating at that time.  There are definitely better ramen places in the city, but overall Kenzo is not bad if you want a quick bite in the area."}
{"text":"I was very happy when i discovered this place, as I am a huge fan of Ramen. They have lots of different choices of ramen to chose from. I just wish you were able to pick different broths for the different types of ramen. I also wish they had the option of super sizing the ramen instead of having just one super sized option.   Last time i was here I also ordered takoyaki, which was very freshly made and come out piping hot. Would definitely order them again. The only item I was extremely disappointed about was the unigiri.   Overall, i love this place. The customer service is excellent and the staff is very polite and friendly. Just make sure you come with extra time because it can be a wait to find seating. Anywhere from 5-20min wait time. This placed is always packed full."}
{"text":"I love soup and all kinds of it so on the first cold Saturday the husband and I headed out to Kenzo for some ramen. It's probably not the best time to go because when we got there at 6:30 there was an hour and a half wait for a table. We had no plans besides this and drove a while to get here so we toughed it out. I think Mississauga could use a few more good ramen places though! Be prepared for a wait, others in line were saying it's almost always busy. It's a pretty small place and obviously people love it. That being said the lobby area is tiny so if it's winter you'll probably be outside in the cold.   Once we were finally seated I ordered the Netsu and he ordered the Tonkotsu. I wouldn't say they're as spirited as Kinton but the service was friendly and fast. And real chopsticks yay! The ramen came really hot so don't just dig in or you'll scold your mouth. I was satisfied with it, the veggies were cooked well but not over and same goes for the noodles. Great noodles. I did think there wasn't enough chicken in it I had to dig to find my 4 little pieces. The Tonkotsu was good as well but a little too much garlic, this also could be too much of the garlic on the rim sliding in.   In the end we were satisfied and warmed up. However I still think Kinton reigns as they have more flavour in their broth. It's good for pretty much the only ramen place in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! The servers know exactly how to read their customers' body language. They always check around and look to see if anyone is need of a drink refill etc. They're also very quick and accommodating.  Food-wise, EXCELLENT. I've had both ramen and rice dishes as well as the dumpling and takoyaki appetizers. Everything is made in-house which is a huge plus and rare nowadays. The only reason why I couldn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the portions were a little bit bigger considering a bowl of ramen ranges from $10-15 per bowl.  Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Japan, I tend to be harsher when it comes to Japanese food (and I try not to give 1 or 2 star reviews unless I visited the place a couple times). The service was good/normal, but I honestly don't know how Kenzo stays in business. The noodles are unremarkable (I can probably go to an Asian supermarket and get a better one), and the soup did not have a lot of flavour.   I never thought I would say this ever in my life, but I think I can make a better ramen. It was equivalent to a ramen I would get at an AYCE sushi restaurant, and it hurts to know that ramen is their main food at Kenzo.  I may try it again in a couple years because I don't like leaving 1, 2 star reviews."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that this is the only ramen place in Mississauga that I know of (excluding those in the food court), but nevertheless, the ramen here is fantastic. This place has friendly service and is always busy. I always leave feeling full and satisfied and a bonus is that there is chattime right next door for bubble tea. They also have vegetarian options, which is a plus point. I only had a bad experience once, which was when I tried their newest option on their menu: Tsukemen. The issue I had with this was that the noodles were clumped together and therefore made it impossible to eat. I had to ask for a fork and knife and ended up cutting up my noodles, which made me look like an idiot. Therefore, unless they have changed their recipe for Tsukemen, order anything else on the menu and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Expect line ups outside the door during weekends and dinner times. Ramen consists of bouncy noodles that sit in a rich broth and accompanied by several slices of pork and vegetables. Tried both the shio and shoyu ramen and both were equally delicious and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This Kenzo Ramen seems to be solo eater's heaven!  Not only it has tons of tables for 2 which are perfect for single, there were in fact 5 tables of single while I was eating there.   Wait staffs are a lot friendlier than the other locations I been to, especially the Dundas location.  My Netsu Ramen ($8.95) level 3 spicy also a lot spicier than the one I had in other locations?! The noodles were chewy and cooked al dente.....really warmed me up on this cold winter's night!  Another great Ramen location if I have a Ramen Attack!!"}
{"text":"After being to all 3 locations of Kenzo Ramen in Toronto, This particular Kenzo now officially won \"The Worse Services\" and \"The Most Unfriendly Waitstaff\" award.   Though I cannot fault the food... the Ramens we ordered were excellent... But in order to eat that Ramen we have to endure crappy and unfriendly services?!!   No smile, No greetings... Just point...at the empty table  You ask for something, no acknowledgement.. if you lucky you might get what you request?  No Thanks, No Bye...   For me is BYE... since now your location is NOT the only one in town!!"}
{"text":"Service here is bad. Food here is mediocre.   One hot summer day, I came here during a slow period, only one or two tables were taken. I was seated at a table directly under the air conditioner. I was freezing so I asked to move to a booth or another table. They told me no because I only had a party of two and booths and the other tables were for a party of 4 or more. After telling them I'm freezing, they turned the air conditioner off, just to turn it on 2 minutes later.  Regarding the food, it was okay. Nothing special. You can find better ramen down the street at Sansotei."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen, in the neighbourhood, has been a diet mainstay for a couple of years now.  I have probably eaten here 10 or more times, and it's a go-to on a rainy day.    It can get pretty busy and the tables are in close quarters--basically ambience-free, Kenzo is pretty much just about the noodles.  And they're good!  I usually get the Tonkotsu or King of Kings, both of which fill the ramen void within.   The broth is really good, the slices of pork are tender and moist, and you'll leave stuffed.  The service is often sporadic and rushed, but I'm paying $7 for dinner and the food always comes out fast.  It's a great fix if you're in the neighbourhood; if you're specifically seeking out excellent ramen or want great service, there are definitely better places to do that."}
{"text":"Po's king of the king ramen is really tasty and full of indigents. mine is you u ramen which is okay. Maybe a little bit salty in the end"}
{"text":"Nice ramen place in Missisauga. I love the spicy ramen broth with bamboo and pork. Try the rice too"}
{"text":"Got the King(?) Ramen. Asked for it to be medium hot which they accommodated and was divine. It was delicious and so filling! I was very happy with my order. We also got the takoyaki to share. I dont think I habe ever had a better takoyaki! And I have been to actual japanese restaurants known for this dish. It was crispy on the outside and warm and goey on the inside.   The service? Slow... But only because there was only one person working that day. This place still gets 5 stars because the server was amazing! He did his best with the crazy workload he had and did it with a smile. And honestly that makes a difference in dining experience.   Yes I will come again. Yes I will order the same things."}
{"text":"As ramen places go this was all around solid.  There was a wait for a table but leas than 15 mins.  Menu was pretty standard but pricing seemed high for a bowl of noodles.  7.95-12.95...our table had tokoyaki to start which were great but again pricey at 9.95.  Also tried the tuna fish onigiri which was quite tasty.  Some if the ramen brother was spicy and from the non spicy section so that was a bit if a downer.. Then we were promised a 20% discount and was never given it.  Want to give thus one another shot, but it will all depend in if we can find something better before the ramen itch"}
{"text":"Flavors from the pork belly are great.  Noodles are exactly what you are looking for when you are craving ramen.  Octopus balls had good flavour but seemed a little under done. Pricing overall is average to a little higher than you would find in mist downtown noodle houses but decor is very clean and staff is uber friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!! There may be a wait list during the busy days/nights but it's worth the wait. The servers at burhamthorpe rd was super nice and gave us more ice on water on a very hot day!  HOWEVER!!! I have to lose 1 star for a reason (applicable to all Kenzo stores): their chopsticks are made out of metal and if you know science, if you eat a hot noodle using something metallic, metal will be hot as hell. The amount of times I burnt my mouth and my lips with this thing while having a nice hot ramen is unbelievable. It's not safe at all, I rather use a shitty plastic chopsticks than eat a burning metal one."}
{"text":"The Toronto location's much better, but because it seems to be the only legit ramen house in Mississauga as of yet (hopefully more in the future), I'll give it that extra star for convenience and accessibility.  I always enjoy their takoyaki, Ji Su Men, and their friendly greeting whenever I walk in and out of the door."}
{"text":"According to the Toronto Star, \"Kenzo's tonkotsu ramen is awash in sodium. Its 3,388 milligrams is about 1,000 milligrams more than the maximum recommended daily allotment\".  While I am not a fan of licking-salt, I would make exception for joy molecules-inducing food.   Unfortunately, the food at Kenzo was a disappointment. The Orochong Ramen ($8.95) was not flavorful. The supposedly Hokkaido favorite topped with stir fried green onions, green peppers, red peppers, mushrooms, chicken and cabbage was over powered by salt.   Takoyaki (around $9.00) filled with octopus, green onion, cheese and shrimp flavouring was doughy. It lacks the crispy exterior one comes to expect from Takoyaki.   Chicken Karaage (around $7.00) traditional Japanese fried chicken was one of the worst dishes we had that day. What is supposedly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside was spongy on both counts. How Kenzo managed to create such an abomination is beyond my comprehension.    There is an endless loop of 90s heart-wrenching music playing the background in Kenzo. One speculation was that the chef was crying in the back kitchen. The sodium from his/her tears was incorporated in the soup and perhaps also contributed to the soggy Karaage."}
{"text":"I come here once awhile for Ramen. Great atmosphere and service.  Food are fresh and nicely presented.  However the potion might be small for my stomach and taste is too salty side for me..  otherwise it's a great lunch out place."}
{"text":"I got the Netsu ramen in medium and boy was it spicy! Next time I'm getting mild. It was still decent although I'm not a fan of the noodles. Decent portion size. I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen as well and I preferred that. The broth and meat were delicious in that one. It seemed a bit small especially for the price."}
{"text":"The Agedashi tofu that we ordered for a starter was good, but the soy sauce based ramen was lackluster. Next time we will try a different type of ramen. If you like green tea like we do, definitely try the smoothie! But ask for half the sweetness, it's more than enough."}
{"text":"Not the greatest but certainly good enough for me to get a quick ramen fix.   My only complain is their exorbitant charge for adding more tonkatsu. The waiter wasn't sure of the extra charge and told me it would be between 1 to 2 bucks. I said either way is fine. Well, I only got TWO extra slices of pork and was charged $2.50!!! I felt totally ripped off but hopefully this will not repeat with another customer.   The green tea latte was great. The authenticity of the tea can be tasted from the the matcha powder they used.   Overall decent place except for my misadventure of the tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a quick lunch . I got the miso ramen and my friend got a yakisoba.  We loved our food. I do feel the miso  was a bit on the salty side . The pork was tender and the noodles were soft.  My friends yakisoba  was flavourful but slightly oily . Overall a good experience. If we are in the mood for a quick meal sure why not  . A big plus point was the presence of an outlet to charge our phones.  We foodies need to charge our phones  to take pictures  of our meals and update social media with them."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen place in Mississauga! The atmosphere is super friendly, they have great appetizers on top of their ramen, and their ramen is the best I've had in the area! Not to mention they're super vegetarian friendly (but make sure to mention that you don't eat fish as well!)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a simple and good tasting noodle soup dish, this is the place to go. The kitchen operates well and seems to be able to fulfill orders quite quickly. Prices for the ramen dishes are also fair, if not very affordable. I would recommend going with their recommended menu options as they truly are delicious!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Of course their ramen! But you get to choose - spicy, tonkatsu based, soy based among many different soup bases they have. I personally like tonkatsu based soups because of its creaminess but it can be heavy, so shoyu soup base may be a good option too. Seafood ramen is good with LOTS of seafood!   I ordered the king shoyo ramen which was double the size of the regular shoyo. You get double the ingredients and toppings, and noodle too! It did have the soy sauces tangy flavor which was good!   My friend ordered the netsu ramen which had a kick of spice in the soup. Instead of pork, the chicken option was ordered. Pieces of chopped chicken was added to the bowl instead.   The bowls were pretty big and can be an inexpensive meal if you want something quick. Lots of other options to order and you can also order donburi which are the rice dishes if you're not feeling ramen.   They don't allow you to choose thickness of the noodle though.   LAST TIP?!  It's always sooo busy at this restaurant since it's the only ramen specialty restaurant in Mississauga. So come either right when it opens or when they're closing or else be prepared to wait! It's first come first serve basis, however on weekends, they can call your number to let you know you're next so you can walk around the plaza close by before they call you!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Sauga for the majority of my life and I've probably been to Kenzo like 4x rofl. I've been told that it's not the greatest compared to ramen joints in Toronto and they're not wrong. Kenzo is always so busy.. especially during prime dinner time. I came on a Tuesday evening around 445pm and there was no rush of people yet. By the time we left, there was a line up of people! So if they're busy on a Tuesday night, chances are they're busy every night lol. I think Kenzo is the only ramen place in Sauga.. so maybe that's why it's really busy (?).   The first 3x I went, I didn't like the ramen. Then I'm hearing that it's gotten better recently. Turns out I was craving ramen today and since it's the only one in Sauga.. I'll give it another go. We got seated quickly and made our order. It took forever for our food to come out and I was surprised cause the last time I came it was really busy but I got it fast. I ordered the King of King noodles because I like ramen soup bases that has some spice to it. There's 3 levels of spice and I got the 2nd one. I liked the level of spice the soup had. Was perfect.  The King ramen actually had a lot of veggies in it and I don't like that at all. Felt like there was more veggies than noodles and the bowl looked massive. There were mushrooms, seaweed, green onions, carrots, bamboo shoots, cabbage, and bean sprouts in it.  Bean sprouts, green onions and bamboo shoots were good in it but everything else felt out of place. Way too much crunching in ramen   Ramen noodles were mediocre.  The pork pieces was soft and tender and the sliced egg was pretty good too.  Service was decent.   Sadly, all the times I've come here to eat were a bust.. don't think I'd be coming back."}
{"text":"After all my visits to this restaurant. It's still one of my favorites restaurants in mississauga and one of my favorite places to get gyudon.   Their Gyudon (beef on rice) is extremely delicious. I usually get my order without ginger and 2 additional raw eggs. Would totally recommend it. I love how it's really flavorful and juicy. The rice and beef blend perfectly together.   The service here is excellent. Every time i come here, it feels like home. All the services are extremely friendly and attentive.    There's always a wait here during rush hours like lunch and dinner. So to avoid the wait, come during off hours."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of good choices around the Eaton Centre for lunch or dinner, but this is my standby.  The dishes have a bit of a Korean spin to them, but the broth is well done (sometimes a tad salty), the noodles are good, and I haven't had a bad experience with service as others have."}
{"text":"I have to echo the sentiments of my fellow yelpers in saying that this place was mediocre at best, and the (lack of) service was what tipped it from being a three star experience to a one and a half or two star at most.   Our server was terse and forgetful - if this is, as some have said, \"par for the course\" when eating at a Japanese or Korean restaurant I'd honestly rather just cut the cuisine out of my repertoire entirely. I don't have much room in my dining life for terrible service. Within seconds of sitting down we were urged to order appetizers, yet we hadn't even been provided with menus. When I saw a nearby table snacking on steamed edamame, I decided to order it, only to be told that they don't have edamame on the menu. English was very limited so I didn't have the energy to argue.   I ordered the \"orochong ramen\", and thankfully one of my dinner mates spoke Korean and was able to request a vegetarianized version. I honestly feel like whenever I eat at an Asian restaurant I am at the mercy of the chefs when it comes to respecting my dietary preferences. I can never be sure if what I'm eating is truly vegetarian. It's a real trust thing.   The food was piping hot and the portion was ample. It was a little spicy for my tastes (and I like spicy food) and I was only able to finish about 1/5th of my meal. Despite this, the server didn't once ask if anything was wrong with my food or if I wanted to take it to go. It just sat in front of me, untouched, until after I had left. Apparently one of my dinner mates DID ask to have her food wrapped up and never saw it again. I wouldn't return.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here it is tasty and fresh. Hard to get seats as it is  popular but for a good reason.  You might want to call ahead to see how busy it is."}
{"text":"There is not many seats so even though the line may be short, it may take some time to be seated. Tried to come here for weekday lunch a few times, but there is always a line.  So I finally waited the line out and had some of their nice miso ramen!! Nice shop. Definitely a nice place to get your noodle soup fix."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they just opened the dundas location recently, and the place they had at Yonge/Finch was just too far from me despite hearing very good things.  So I was pretty excited to try it, and it didn't dissapoint.    They do have a limited menu right now but I'm sure that will change in time.  I don't think they had tonkotsu so I settled with some salt-based ramen which was ok, but I definitely want to head back to try some other flavors.    The staff was obviously new, but polite and it was pretty fast.  All in all, just excited about a decent ramen place in the core of the city.  Hopefully this will spawn several new ramen noodle joints and become the new Pho."}
{"text":"To temporarily satisfy a ramen craving, this will have to do. We got the tonkotsu and miso ramen, both of which was OK.  I kept waiting for that punch of flavor to hit me, but so many spoonfuls later, it just never hit the spots. The broth was fatty, just slightly bland.  While I'm a newbie to the Toronto ramen scene, I've been to my fair share of ramen spots in LA and some in New York, and this place barely scratches the surface. Left me wanting more. So the search for good ramen in Toronto continues."}
{"text":"I had the Tonkatsu ramen here during the dinner time and I thought it was alright. It wasn't very filling, but it was generally decent. The noodles were good and the soup flavor was great, but I wish the portions were slightly bigger."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as well as the service, especially on a cold night. Got a ramen Bowl, gyoza and onigiri and all were delicious. My girlfriend got the yakisoba and she said it was quite tasty (it certainly looked good). Would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Food's good. Service is fast. Try the Netsu Ramen. I've tried level 2's got a good kick to it, but doesnt burn your tongue."}
{"text":"Ramania. Noun. Desperately seeking out ramen the moment the temperature drops below 20 degrees celcius. In a sentence: I have ramania.   Had my first Kenzo ramen of the season the other night, and it was fabulous. I love their Tonkotsu pork ramen, add hot sauce. Beyond this dish, I prefer a couple of other ramen joints, but this one they do very, very well."}
{"text":"This place is busy and for good reason. The soup base has tremendous flavour. And so many to choose from! There's a lineup everytime I go but the wait makes the meal all the more desirable. I think a bit of wait is always a good way to build up hype and anticipation. Great way for kenzo to get noticed by passers-by.   Great spot for dates, family dinners and friends. If you like some spice and kick when you indulge in ramen, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I actually came here in the summer with friends but never got to try it because of the long wait times. So today I got a chance to try it out.   We both ordered the tonkatsu ramen for lunch. It came out fairly quicky and tasted pretty decent imo. The slices of pork were my favourite! So tender and soft. The broth was a bit salty and the presentation wasn't that nice to post on instagram.  Overall, it was okay but nothing special. I'm not a ramen person so I think one time is good enough for me."}
{"text":"Kenzo is the only ramen restaurant that I am aware of the existence of a Nagasaki-style champon ramen on its menu. And it didn't disappoint me at all!! The seafood and the tonkatsu soup was a perfect combination! And the bowl is so giant and the volume of the ramen is way more than what I expected. I can't even eat it up."}
{"text":"Love it. They are so friendly. The food is fresh and taste great. You can ask them for vegetarian broth which they will gladly do. The takoyaki are great they taste really good it's very authentic. The onigiri is really good as well."}
{"text":"Pork pan fried Dumplings are perfect!! Black garlic ramen was sooooo good!! Service was good!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright - portions are bigger than Santosei but quality is lower than that of Kinton. In a pinch, it should do to quelch any ramen cravings."}
{"text":"I have tried Kenzo ramen long before Sansotei or Santouka opened in the same area, honestly when I first tried the ramen at kenzo, I liked it. Though I am not sure if i have tried other Japanese owned ramen nearby and I found a comparison between both, and i do think sansotei ramen is better than kenzo, the tonkotsu ramen from kenzo is good, the milky taste which is very tasty, but the noodle itself i would like sansotei or santouka more. I would still come back again for lunch though."}
{"text":"Always come here for RAMEN LEVEL 3 SPICY, the taste is the best if compare to other RAMEN on queen st. The service is incredible great and fast.  Totally Recommend."}
{"text":"Not really worth coming out of your way to this place. Okay if you're looking for a ramen fix. Place is run mostly by Koreans from what I can tell. Seems like a lot of people come here but food is very medicore."}
{"text":"I was not a Kenzo fan because of its below average quality ramen. But yesterday my gf took home a fried noodle take out for me, the chicken and veggies were burnt(visually) and tasted bitter, the person who made the noodle could have remaked one but instead, he let the customer bring this burnt food home. Will never order any takeouts from this store."}
