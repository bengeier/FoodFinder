{"text":"Went there with 2 friends for lunch on Victoria Day and contracted severe food poisoning from eating extremely off salmon sashimi. The sashimi had a terrible colour and was falling apart. Apart from contracting food poisoning we didn't like that you weren't able to write down what you wanted, instead you had to dictate your order on the spot to a waitress. The price was also too high. I will not be returning and will be contacting the health department to have them do an inspection."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here all the time for all you can eat sushi. It's been our go to place since it opened. It's nice to have an AYCE place that actually cares about the presentation of its food!"}
{"text":"This my second favourite AYCE and favourite in the Toronto area. Great fish quality and lots of options for cool appetizers. Great great place."}
{"text":"4.5*  I've been to California several times now. Either for lunch or dinner... takeout or dine in... and each time I've been impressed.  Their all you can eat menu is pretty impressive and it covers way more than just sushi/maki rolls (And they got pretty good sushi too). Not only that, everything is fresh and tasty.   Here is a list of items that stand out: shrimp tempura, scallop cutlet, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, chicken fried rice, and beef ribs (i usually get 3 servings of these bad boys!), and anything off the maki/sushi menu.   Lastly, I've got to mention that the place is very clean, new and modern looking inside and the service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. I order here occasionally when we don't feel like cooking or going out. About six months ago I found a scrap of metal in one of my dishes. I didn't think much, maybe a scrap of tinfoil, but definitely an accident. Some time passed, thought we'd give it another try.. I literally just pulled an almost identical piece of scrap metal out of my food. I'm over this shit.. look at the photo and see for yourself. I'll be calling the health board."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner at this newly opened All You Can Eat Sushi place in Leaside.  They have a full a la carte menu as well with a bigger variety, but we decided to give the AYCE a try.  It's a new place just two doors down from the Hollywood Gelato in what used to be another asian restaurant (Asian Bowl maybe?).  It has room for 36 people since it only has 18 tables for two (yes, we counted) and no sushi bar, but the decor seemed quite nice and basic.  It's new so it's also very clean, even the washrooms, which are down the stairs near the back of the restaurant.  They were very clean although quite small with room for just one person at a time.  The AYCE menu has a lunch option which I believe was $14 and dinner was $20 with an extra $2 on weekends and holidays.  The big difference was that dinner included Sashimi and a few other things like desserts.  Like most AYCE places these days, the menu is a large single sheet that you keep ordering off of.  Unlike some of the other AYCE places we've been to with bigger menus and larger selections, California Roll had a more limited menu, but really made up for it in other ways.  The staff, including the owner, are incredibly attentive and service was faster and more efficient than anything we've experienced in a Toronto in years.  Granted, we went for dinner at 5:30 p.m. on a week night and the restaurant was only half full, but it still impressed us.  Our Green tea was never allowed to go below half a cup before being refreshed and all we had to do was pick up the menu and start talking about something before there was someone there to take our order.  We made sure to eat a lot of the Sashimi, and it was amazing, especially the Red Snapper and Sea Clam.  We also tried lots of the Salmon and Tuna.  We had a few rolls and some Salmon, Tuna, and Red Snapper Sushi, but really concentrated on the Sashimi since it was so delicious, fresh and sweet.  This was definitely the freshest fish I'd ever had at an AYCE place, which made it so different from the many other places we'd been to in the GTA like Kaze or Maison de Japan where we've even had fish delivered to our table that was still partially frozen.  Yuck!  The fish at California Roll was so good that this was the first time I'd ever Sushi and Sashimi without any Soy & Wasabi.  The presentation was also very beautiful and was much more of what you'd expect at the high end Japanese places.  The portions were small in order to prevent waste, but since it's AYCE, who cares!    Apart from the Sashimi and Sushi, we tried a couple of rolls which were typical of any other AYCE place, but also a Seaweed Salad, an Avocado Salad that melted in my mouth, Teriyaki Chicken that was tender and delicious, a Sirloin with mushroom dish, curry dishes that had a delicious buttery flavor, Tempura dishes including a plate of lightly battered Onion Rings which were great, and a Cheese Wonton that was an unexpected treat.  For dessert we had the Fried Ice Cream which only comes in Green Tea flavour and the Tempura battered and fried Banana with Honey.  Both were good, but the amount of Green Tea Ice Cream was tiny and could have used a much bigger scoop so the it wouldn't be so overwhelmed by the Tempura batter surrounding it.  I had a Kirin beer and my wife had warm Sake which both seemed reasonably priced (around $4 or $5 I think), with a total bill of just over $60 before tip.  Our previous favorite in the GTA had been Kaze, but rather than trekking all the way up to Elgin Mills and Bayview anymore we'll be staying south of Eglinton for our new favorite AYCE place."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty decent, but what I really like is the salmon sushi pizza.  It's really one of the better ones out there.  They do a pretty darn good job with the all you can eat selection too. I wouldn't say it's the best sushi restaurant in sushi, but it's reasonable in terms of quality and price, so for a quick weeknight dinner, it's a great choice."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place on valentines day. This cozy, as in you can hear your neighbour's conversation, tight place has great ambience and surprisingly could accommodate our toddler as they have high chairs.   We opted for the all you can eat menu, which although vast, lacked certain things in terms of premium items such as octopus, squid, salmon roe to name a few. It did however have some redeeming items such as beef tenderloin, grilled beef ribs, and sirloin teriyaki for the meat lovers.   We ordered the avocado salad (iceberg lettuce topped with 3 small slices of avocado doused in a weak vinegrette), the mango salad (house greens topped with sparse slices of unripened mango doused with a diluted sour dressing), the seaweed salad (decent), kimchi (decent), and Miso soup (sub par).   The udon seafood noodle soup was ok for an all you can eat. The veggie and shrimp tempura were good however the shrimp was over battered for my taste. We ordered the popcorn chicken which was tasty and the chicken wings which were covered in the same batter as popcorn chicken. The beef tenderloin was very good. The sirloin, grilled salmon belly, and beef ribs were ok.   We also ordered the spider roll which was good, the volcano roll which was a California roll with the imitation crab doused in sauce and shredded overtop (ok but not great), and the black dragon roll (good but not memorable). The sashimi was very good and fresh though limited in selection. We ordered the salmon, white tuna, surf clam. We also ordered the shrimp and eel sushi which were both very good.   Dessert was good. They have a variety of ice cream to choose from (green tea, red bean, vanilla, mango, coconut), deep fried banana (amazing), and deep fried ice cream (we didn't try).   Service was excellent. Although the place was jammed, they did their best to bring us all our food and take repeat orders, as well as fill up our waters. They only forgot one item (beef wrapped enoki mushrooms).  The bill was $60 for two and a child under 3 ($2 for the child). There was not that much for our toddler to eat but we managed to feed him beef, salmon, avocado, noodles, squash, zucchini and chicken. There were however no fruits for him since the mango was a bit hard.   Overall, it was ok for an AYCE. Regular price is $23.50 but they charge an extra $3 for weekends and holidays. There are extra items available for weekends and holidays on the menu, but they were nothing unusual. Rosette salmon rolls, mango salad, spicy tuna and salmon rolls, sweet/sour chicken and BBQ buns. Although they have a large menu, a lot of the items were the same ingredients but in a different format."}
{"text":"Ordered the Party platter. It was ok. Not great."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now and each time I see an improvement on their service and speeds. I really enjoy the quality of the food here. The sushi tastes fresh and the other foods are quite tasty as well. Their rolls are well made but the last time I went they didn't have spider rolls which are my favourite so I was a little disappointed with that.  Minus that one set back ordered lots of sashimi, a variety of rolls, and the kids that were with us (under 3) went to town on the avocado and shrimp tempura. There are some other things to be aware of like they have the leaf which is supposed to represent a vegetarian option beside some obvious meat items... Small things like that I find amusing though. This is now probably my favourite sushi place in town and even though it's out of the way for me, about 12km one way, I'll continue to make that trip to eat here. There are other sushi places closer to me but I still prefer California Roll. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"We've been to California Roll several times and had enjoyed it. The price has increased and my favourite sushi (ginger salmon) is no longer on the menu. It used to be a good AYCE deal, but not at current prices. Service is quick, perhaps too quick. We were in and out in under an hour - for dinner."}
{"text":"First off, I hardly ever write reviews but I am exploding over my customer service experience at California Roll.  My friend and I went here for lunch for the first time. I ordered a lunch special which was a dynamite roll and an avocado roll. I asked the server for two substitutions - if I could add salmon to my avocado roll (which was a $2 additional charge) and if I could have two salads instead of a miso soup and a salad (and she wanted to charge me the difference in price). I eat sushi about 3 times a week all over the city and I've NEVER been charged for a salad substitution. I told the server I'd like the extra salmon but not the two salads. When my lunch came I was given my dynamite roll and a regular avocado roll. When I super kindly explained to the server that I asked for a salmon avocado, out of no where she got extremely mad at me. She insisted that this was what I asked for and tried imitating how our order went down. Mortified in front of my friend, I remained polite and tried to explain that perhaps the confusion was when I said no to the salad but yes to the salmon, MID CONVERSATION she literally rolled her eyes, flipped her hand and WALKED A-W-A-Y!!!! I've NEVER had such rude and inconsiderate service in my ENTIRE life. I could not believe that I was arguing over a small piece of salmon for this much drama. I even tried offering multiple suggestions including just giving me a small piece of sashimi which I would happily put on top of my roll but she wanted to charge me an extra $5!!! She kept going from the kitchen back to our table and every time she returned, I thought it would be over but she every time she literally point blank insisted this was MY fault. It was at this point she tried telling me that she's not allowed to make substitutions and they do not allow adding salmon to the avocado roll. How did she come up with the price of $2 when I ordered then?? Apparently no solution was possible so I told her I wasn't going to eat my meal and she could take it all back. With a few more attempts of plopping the food down in front of me, eye rolls, teeth kissing and combative arguments initiated by the server, she finally added salmon to my roll. This entire ordeal took over ten minutes of back and forth. I will *NEVER* be going back there again. There are many other sushi places in the area, let alone on Bayview and that was by far my worst experience in a restaurant, period. When we got the bill, she also charged us for $1 for green tea... Never knew that was a thing... I'm livid."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi restaurants in the GTA. The sashimi is always very fresh and delicious. Restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"ordered food with strict instructions in bold letters - ALLERGY. food still came with items listed.   were supposed to be credited for next order, and of course there was nothing in the system... would have to call back tomorrow for a manager - why wasn't there a manager present? why would i want the item tomorrow?  poor communication, poor delivery (hot food comes warm, cold food comes warm, wait for longer than 1hr) super poor customer service"}
{"text":"okay, okay, okay. I've been going here since 2012 and it's definitely the most consistent sushi place in the area. Definitely bang for you buck at lunch, a little pricey for dinner but hey - $30 for all you can eat dinner is pretty good.  Our usual order includes: a boatload of sushi - try the SALMON ROSE & FRY ROLL, thank me later. beef short ribs (so delicious) har gaw (shrimp dumplings) salmon belly (!!!)  Service is consistent. We go so often for dinner that we've noticed they have the same playlist playing every day haha really nice staff, friendly service and delicious food."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi place. I promise. Service is fast and the staff is super nice! The presentation of the sashimi platter is always beautiful.  My wife and I come here at least twice a month. Don't forget to leave room for the fried ice cream!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit too much rice with their rolls but great service and the avocado is always fresh! If you enjoy avocado with your sushi, it's a bummer that they don't have green dragon rolls on their AYCE menu. Advisable to make reservations before coming if you have a large group. Have seen it get pretty packed for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb. My wife and I are huge fans of AYCE sushi joints and this place is the best of a great bunch in T-dot. Just wonderful. Crispy, flavorful teriyaki chicken, spicy tuna sushi rolls and tempura zucchini were just a few of the highlights. Why are you still reading this? Get there! Now!"}
{"text":"This is one of the pricier AYCE sushi places I enjoy. But the quality of the fish and the cook of the meat is perfect. It's tiny, had a patio (why??) and the service is okay. Not the best but also not the worst. But the sushi is delicious!!  Certain items can only be ordered on the weekend. One such item is the salmon rose. Now I like my salmon rose, but this place serves up large portions of it. Quite a mouthful (and I'm not the most graceful diner either!).  Some of the special rolls are interesting, but hands down the best one, the one you come back for, is the Fry Roll. Just perfection!  Btw, if you want the deep fried ice cream dessert, it only comes in Mango ice cream flavour. Annnnnd, the ladies toilet seat completely detaches from the bowl so be careful!!  There's certainly places with better price points, and I'm sure the same quality of fish and culinary skill can be found there, but do they have the Fry Roll??! Also, this particular strip of Bayview does have other Japanese options, but from what I recall, California Roll wins without a battle."}
{"text":"Good all you can eat menu. Fast service. Lots of variety including ramen, teriyaki, udon and curries. Nice patio and very friendly."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their delivery as I've never had a dine-in experience at this restaurant.  I've ordered from this place through the now defunct TasteAway.ca and OrderIt.ca and I've never been disappointed.  It's usually just me and my wife and we usually just get sashimi, sushi, or maki rolls but we have also ordered udon and party trays when we have guests over.  We've always found the raw fish to be very fresh in both appearance and taste which I'd say is the most important. They also take the time to focus on the appearance of the fish within their take-out container. Nice touch.  Udon orders come quite large when we order the tempura udon as each of udon noodles, broth and tempura get their own container. This prevents sogginess and preserves the quality of the food.  Delivery is usually around the 45 minutes as they forecast and this is despite living in a high traffic area made worse by the Eglinton Crosstown LRT construction. That said, even our party tray orders arrive in same time as our orders for just two people.  This has quickly become our \"go to\" place for Japanese food orders and keep placing orders with them as long as they're still around."}
{"text":"Overall, very pleasantly surprised. We typically travel to Markham for AYCE sushi but this place was better than our Markham AYCE option.   The good: - Fresh Fish - Great non-fish dishes as well - Nice decor  The bad: - Kinda slow with the rolls, perhaps so fresh they fish for the fish - I don't know what it is about the menu but it's kinda confusing - The parking sitch can be tricky as that strip of Eglinton is quite busy with rests  Definitely go check it out!"}
{"text":"I have decided to revise my review. This is officially my favourite sushi place in all of Toronto. Fresh fish, great variety of sushi and maki rolls. Amazing menu. Friendly staff. You may have to wait a bit longer if they are busy but it's definitely worth the wait. The atmosphere is great. I've tried many sushi places all over the city. This one definitely takes the cake."}
{"text":"Seaweed salad isn't  the best as it is crunchy. Miso soup is fine. Tampura was good. No samshimi in lunch. Good udon soup. Quick service. Good price for lunch."}
{"text":"Looking for some sushi in the Leaside village on Bayview, yes, there are now 3 Japanese eateries on the strip now, we decided to pop to California Roll. It was clean and modern (a bit sterile) inside the small resto with a tiny patio for outdoor dining. The restaurant features an all you can eat menu ($12.99 for lunch, and $18.99 for dinner?). After deciding to pass on stuffing our faces silly we ordered their lunch specials. This is probably one of the cheapest places to eat considering the area, but sadly this was apparent in the food. The salmon bento included just 2 filets of salmon with a lower end teriyaki smothering, a cup of steamed rice, and 2 orange slices. The soup was average, the salad was ok, but the sushi and maki was pretty disappointing. I thought perhaps we would receive a bit better quality for not ordering then AYCE sushi, but I think it was the exact opposite in this case. The salmon maki was a sliver of warm fish surrounded by rice and wrapped poorly, while the other rolls were equally underwhelming in both taste, preparation and quality. Ugh. 2 stars for that dog scrap.  The only reason I give it a 3 is because there AYCE lunch had some really good variety and roll selection and it even had dim sum! The party beside us were feasting on some decent sushi and all sorts of hot dishes from short ribs to steak and garlic. The quality was still probably not the best but for its $12.99 price point, it's worth it to go for the AYCE.   Overall, i probably wouldn't return, but if I ever found myself starving one afternoon in the Leaside village and craving sushi, I'd pop in."}
{"text":"Not the best experience at this place, unfortunately. I've had way better AYCE sushi. Their Spider Roll tasted like tape and the restaurant itself is small. It couldn't work for a big group. Most of their special rolls are only available at dinner, which can be annoying (most AYCE places are more expensive at dinner). Overall, not good."}
{"text":"I really liked California Roll! The selection for the AYCE lunch menu was great. So many choices, including deep fried mashed potato (which I had never tried but loved) and four different kinds of curry. The quality of the rolls was good and the service was decent. Place is really clean and they play some nice throwbacks. It's also in a cute little neighbourhood that you can walk through before/after your meal. AYCE lunch was $14.99 +tax on a Wednesday. It's just up the street from my school so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Where has all the good Asian takeout gone?  The Chicken Yaki Udon was an \"Ewww - don't!\" The totally bland, completely flavorless noodles with flat, tiny ice-shaving sized pieces of chicken didn't even smell appealing. I ordered this because I wanted White chicken meat, not \"White jerky.\" So dry, chewy and paired with those bland noodles, I took two bites and almost threw up in my mouth.   The sweet potato tempura was okay, the AC rolls were okay, but the avocado salad came with absolutely no dressing or vegetables - nothing except some mixed greens and sliced avocado. No carrots, peppers, tomatoes or dressing - anything.   In conclusion, the tempura is okay, but \"You-Don\" want to order noodles here...."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to California Roll since it opened several years ago and it has become one of our favourite spots. The service is always friendly and quick, and the food is fresh and delicious. Last year we booked our wedding rehearsal lunch here for twenty five people and they did an excellent job accommodating such a large group - everyone loved it."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi.   Not bad, but not worth a special trip.   The cost on the website is out dated. The weekday dinner is now $24/person and $26 on Fri and Sat. You need to eat a lot of sushi at those prices.   The selection was more than acceptable with a few extra \"Fri and Sat\" items like pork buns that helped justify the extra cost.   Based on the food the deserve a solid 3 stars. Not great but good.  When I consider the utilitarian atmosphere, inconsistent service, and relative cost, I think 3 stars is a very generous rating."}
{"text":"I love sushi, but I do not love it here. Although they do have a large variety of rolls, I found that most of them where waaaay too salty. The same went for their soy sauce.   I have also tried their Chicken Katsu and Vegetable Udon. The Katsu was pretty tastey, but the Udon was very plain...and had lettuce in it. Regular iceberg lettuce. That seemed a little odd to me.  I do not think I will be coming back. There are a million other sushi places in town to try out."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place with lots of options for dinner buffet. I would rate this place 3.5 stars just because the buffet is pretty expensive, and most portions are very small ($25 for a sushi buffet). On a bright side, the food is really tasty, and their desserts are really good (especially banana tempura with green tea ice cream). I would come back if the buffet would cost about $17, but $25 is just too steep. As I'm not a huge sushi fan, I would go somewhere else, but for someone who loves sushi - you will like it."}
{"text":"Food has no flavor and service is very bad. Place smells like pine sol. Like they are covering up a bad smell. go next door."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best AYCE sushi place in toronto and I have been to many of them. Please pay attention that I said AYCE sushi, you are never gonna have the best sushi in an all u can eat place, of course.   1. Fish here is always fresh 2. Unlike other AYCEs you'll love the chicken, steak and etc. are all great too. 3. Staff are nice and they don't care how many times you order"}
{"text":"California Roll was a mostly disappointing experience for me. The sushi itself was alright, but their apparent cheapness was irritating. (They even charge for tea! More on that later.)  The first thing I noticed was the lack of an order sheet -- strange for an all-you-can-eat. As we dictated our order to the server, the woman seemed impatient. This made me wonder if eliminating the order sheet was more about making us order less than improving service.  Another thing we noticed was their combining so many items onto one plate they would be practically falling off. Is it really worth this to save a bit of washing? And the soy sauce was extra salty. You'd think for consistency they'd cheap out on the sodium content too!  I could have forgiven all of this had they not surprised us with a $1 charge for each tea. It is commonplace for tea to be free, especially with all-you-can-eat. This trickiness left a sour taste, and I think will prevent many customers from coming back. It's just a poor business move.  With tip we paid $32 each for average food, below-average service and, yes, our tea. They certainly won't be making a repeat customer out of me."}
{"text":"What a cute spot!  We came here on a whim for a (very early) lunch - I had a hankering for sushi, and fortunately you're never far from it in Toronto.   The restaurant is medium sized and very nicely designed - I love their simplistic decor, it was very clean and open looking. We were greeted by the friendly sushi chef and quickly seated by their server.   While I desperately wanted AYCE, which is only $12.99 for lunch and seemed quite extensive - but alas, time was against me so I went with the a la carte menu. I ordered salmon roll, tuna roll, and California roll (aka Makimono Set... I think). The California roll was especially delicious (good thing, since that's their name and all!) and everything was very fresh. The salad and miso that came with the meal were kind of \"meh\", but I don't expect a lot from those additions in a restaurant like this.   I wouldn't hesitate to come back to California Roll, if only I was in the neighbourhood more often.   Minus 1 Point: $1 for green tea.   Bonus point: patio!"}
{"text":"We were in the area & got hungry so we came here for their AYCE lunch. I was pleasantly surprised at the larger than expected proportions of each dish. I was stuffed in no time. Wait staff were fast & courteous. My only complaints would be the place is a little small & crowded. Also their veggie fried rice was a bit greasy & tasteless. Given how small the location was they only had one washroom for the ladies & men's each. This place would go up a rating in my eyes of they had a larger space & improved some of their dishes."}
{"text":"Recently I read that this made the top of the list of best Ayce sushi in toronto (from Toronto.com). We checked it out today and agree that it is good. Paid parking on the street. Inside is a little small, with two floors. The poor servers had to bring everything up the narrow stairs since we sat upstairs. Items we liked today: premium plum wine, sushi was fresh but selection is small, tobiko salad, har gow, siu mai, udon noodle soup, asiago tofu.  Their tempera batter for shrimp was fine but were thick and heavy for the vegetable tempera. Their popcorn chicken they used funny dark meats and left overs that we didn't care for, their beef appetizers were cut into tiny pieces could be improved on size, flavour was fine. They had spider roll listed but told us it was not available. We had dynamite roll, was just alright.   Their dinner prices had increased but the printed price on their menu was outdated and they never told us.   Would I visit again? Yes but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice place especially if the weather allows you to sit  outside. Prices is not to high and food selection is good. Service 5+."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had two different experiences. First time food and service were fine, nothing wonderful but definitely nice enough that I wanted to return. The second time the wait staff were snooty.  I live in the area and will be telling everyone to steer clear of this place and choose one of the other options close by:-))"}
{"text":"I'm constantly on a hunt for the best AYCE sushi in Toronto and I chose to try this place based on the Yelp reviews and the reasonable prices.   The service was superb! They are very attentive and bring your order fast. Green tea is extra charge. The rolls are quit average and nothing special.   There is enough variety of sushi and rolls I think, but again the quality is just mediocre.  The atmosphere is small, cozy and family friendly."}
{"text":"Service is horrible and food takes forever. Food was ok but would never go there again"}
{"text":"We were at this AYCE sushi place last week. It is a decently priced place and the decor isn't overwhelming. It is pretty small and it was busy, which may have contributed to the confusion in our order; we told both the main server and another assistant type guy when we wanted a couple of extra things but they didn't come, which ended up being just as well since we were getting stuffed! The sushi is of good quality and it looks like it is a clean operation... parking is the usual for the area, free on side streets and paid on Bayview Ave. until 9:00pm. We had a good experience and will go back."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5* but the service has definitely declined dramatically. The food is still amazing and fresh so I will continue to eat here for weekday dinners. The best dish is the beef tenderloin. My friend and I would order sometimes 6 of these but they started to catch on and bring the tiniest portions so it's best to emphasize YOU WANT THE BEEF TENDERLOIN. Then you don't have to keep bothering the waitress every 10 seconds for a refill. Also the yellowfish is $2 extra charge and not unlimited, not sure if that's standard but I do not recommend for lunch because all the best dishes aren't offered. Hot sake, edamame, avocado salad, terriyaki! Tip: ask about becoming a VIP for 10%, also cash discount"}
