{"text":"We are members and go quite often! Nice to have something in the neighborhood. Yummy cocktails & great theme nights! I do think the wood floors make it a little loud and they could use variety on the menu, but I will keep returning. Servers and staff are all very nice!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night with a large party of 13. The place was pretty empty. The entire thing was a disaster. It took 20 minutes to get a drink order, which was wrong. Then we ordered and the food came out in a decent amount of time however, one person's order was forgotten. We were all done eating by the time his food came. Two people's mashed potatoes were ice cold and one person's chicken was raw. The waiter begrudgingly took an item off the bill but we will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Thought I would give an honest review of Bolero's since the previous review by Jim W is nearly incomprehensible. Bolero's is located at a private club called Seville, hence the club like upscale atmosphere. 
If you wouldn't join a country club, then don't go there just to save a few bucks. Bolero's is a solid 4 star eatery with an inviting walnut dark wood interior, large windows and a centrally located fireplace. 
The service is thoughtful and the staff is well versed in how to treat paying customers and members. I have had 
nearly everything on the menu and have yet to have a bad meal. While the hamburger is very good, it seems pointless to go to a country club and order such a \"pedestrian\" plate. The prices are very reasonable so live it up. The fish and chips are outstanding as is the roast beef sandwich with a jus. The drinks are generous but too much indulging may lead you to write boorish reviews that sounds remarkably similar to Mr. Howell from Gilligan's island. 
Bottom line, the food is great, the staff is attentive, the atmosphere is elegant yet casual and the views are expansive. I give it 4 stars for food quality, 5 for pricing, and 5 for service. Jim W. may want to stick to Micky \"D's\" less than obsequious service and atmosphere for his burgers. But if you enjoy a good Rib Eye or Reuben sandwich and you want to impress your date with out parting with a bunch of cash, you will enjoy Bolero's. Oh and say Hi to Lovie and Thurston Howell."}
{"text":"After reading other so-so reviews, we were a bit skeptical about even trying this place but decided to go there for lunch to test it out.  The food & service were good but they add an 18% service charge (tip) onto each bill for the wait staff to share.  Our server pointed it out to us as he delivered the bill to our table.  We generally tip in that percentage range for good/very good service so it wasn't an issue except that we don't like to be \"told\" what to tip.  If the service and/or the food was sub-par I would have been outraged at the gall of the restaurant to take away the leverage of sending a message by leaving a small tip or no tip at all.

As they say on Shark Tank, \"For that reason, I'm out\".  We didn't think the food was that good to go so far out of our way and be told we have to tip 18%."}
{"text":"Used to go in and eat and have drinks in the bar. Food was good, friendly staff, service iffy, but not much else close to Seville. 

Then it became Members only. I think it's a beautiful setting with great potential but not managed well. It could be bringing them in much like Blue 32 just outside Seville if done right. Can't get a seat there after 4. Place is packed. 

So much more potential for Boleros than a Members Only country club (mostly empty) place."}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers, wings, wraps and a well stocked bar. The Arnold Palmers quench my thirst. Pasta night is amazing and if you are a Club Corp member they offer a 50% discount. Fine dining at drive-through prices. A treasured retreat."}
{"text":"Used to eat and drink here before they decided being a homeowner in Seville was not a good enough qualifier to enter the premises.  

If they ever open back up to public I might be inclined to give them another chance."}
{"text":"**UPDATED REVIEW**
Countless times I have been up to Boleros, I have had some of the best service and food. However, this last time was a disaster that urges me not to return.

There was literally no one in the restaurant except for the group of 3 golfers who ordered drinks out on the patio. We ordered drinks, chicken fingers, and potato skins. Most of my visit, my drink sat empty on the table. The food took about 30 minutes to come out and by that time, I wasn't even hungry anymore. The food wasn't as good as usual, though it was still decent- mediocre at best. When I ordered I had asked for honey mustard and my waitress said she would go check to see it they had any. Long story short, she never came back to our table. 

Another employee came and I, once again, asked if they had dipping sauce and she said she would check. 10 minutes went by and I was not yet informed. Finally, the employee came by and said they had none. Fed up by the lack of service, I went to use the restroom and found my waitress, who had disappeared, in the front of Boleros holding hands and talking with who I assume was her boyfriend. 

This was not the attentive service and positive environment I had experienced previous times before. I reduced my rating but stand at 4 stars in hopes this was a one-time event. It makes me angry, but at the same time sad to think that Boleros may be running down hill from its once awesome service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, great staff.  Every dish at our table was very good.  
But the restaurant remains members-only."}
{"text":"Good value and good atmosphere....one of the best views in Gilbert! Service can be slow sometimes but the food is always good.  Wednesday night has 1/2 off all bottles of wine.  Try the chicken and brie sandwich."}
{"text":"As too often service slow.  Waiting for brunch it took a long time to get coffee and it arrived lukewarm!!!!  Always understaffed!!!"}
{"text":"All though the young lady was very polite

THIS IS A PRIVATE CLUB! You cannot eat or drink here! If you are not a MEMBER

Should not be in YELP if you can't  enjoy it :-/"}
{"text":"Went their for Eater Brunch, the food was good the service was OK. But I will say they were VERY busy. And when your that busy, its hard to keep track of where your at. 

I would say the only disappointment was with the lack of ability to keep themselves upscale on that day. There was food laying on the floor by the bar, and no one cared to pick it up, the bar was very dirty with uneaten food and dishes ever where. In my opinion, know what your good at, having a Sunday Brunch is hard to do. Because of that I would say raise the price slightly and don't bring on so many reservations."}
{"text":"Good country club fare.  Incredible views and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Why hello dear friend!   How is darling Buffy today?  Good, good, so glad to hear she is recovering from that absolutely hideous pavement rash from the tennis court.  Dreadful!

Jim W belong to a country club?  Perish the thought!  Jim W eat lunch at the country club restaurant, Bolero's, on a 2 for 1 coupon?  Certainly!

I found the indoor dining area to be a bit stuffy and I might even venture perhaps a bit pretentious.  Perhaps.  Shall we take our lunch out on the veranda?  Quite so, indeed.  The view of San Tan Mountain is always so splendid this time of year.  Do say!

The service was very good in an obsequious sort of way.  If you enjoy the feeling that you are being fussed over because you might be a big macher (look it up here: http://www.koshernosh.com/dictiona.htm) then you will get off on the service here.

I opted for a cheeseburger and fries.  I was a little disappointed in the fries, thin, slightly coated and unremarkable.  The burger was very good.  The setting was very nice.

OK, Country Club lunch, been there, done that."}
{"text":"I was married at Seville in 2010, and returned on 2/13/15 for my 5th anniversary with my husband. We had visited Seville's site to get the restaurant number and made reservations by phone for 7:30pm. We drove 40 minutes from our home and when we arrived, after waiting 5 minutes for the hostess, we were coldly told that since we weren't members they wouldn't seat us. The website (http://www.clubcorp.com/Clubs/Seville-Golf-Country-Club/Amenities/Dining) makes no mention about being members-only, and you'd think they would mention it while making a reservation, but that wasn't done either. We explained that we had been married there and the hostess blankly stared back at us. What a shame that we can't ever experience dining at our wedding site again. We ended up driving another 40 minutes toward home and had to scramble for another reservation at 8:30pm to celebrate our anniversary. I'd recommend better training for staff to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a while, food is still mediocre, ordered steak & wedge salad and cob salad both not tasty, steak sent back as it was cold, chicken on cob salad dry and flavorless . While servers are always nice, Service is always bad, only customers in whole restaurant and had to get steak sauce on our own as server forgot it.
Manager Tiffany very nice comp meal as it was not that good."}
