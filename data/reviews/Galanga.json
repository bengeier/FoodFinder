{"text":"Ate excellent lunch: Masaman lamb curry, everything fresh, nice lingering hint of cinnamon, courteous helpful service. Everything about the place tasteful, from food to decor. We'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go as far as saying it was the best thai experience as some users have mentioned- it's decent at best, but not spectacular. Quaint spot and friendly staff. Very pricy in comparison to other thai restos."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Montreal.  Great terrace, very good service and best of all it's delicious.  The beef salad and green curry are real standouts, though I've tried half the menu at this point and you can't go wrong.  Both soups are excellent and secretly suspect them of being medicinal.  I ate the soup and beef salad once in the midst of a terrible cold and was better 8 hours later.  THAT deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and were not disappointed.  The service was fast and courteous. I had a curried duck dish (the waiter's recommendation) and it was just terrific, probably some of the best Thai food we've ever had."}
{"text":"Celebrated my sister in law's birthday at this restaurant and I have to say this was the finest Asian meal I've ever enjoyed. Meal was served in timely, non-rushed manner. Food was perfectly cooked and delicious. The courses were served in such a way that we did not feel at all rushed, we talked and laughed through the night. Our party was at least 20 in number and we took up half the restaurant. Good memories, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love spicy food, in most places my request for extra spicy doesn't even tickle my taste buds, but at Galanga, it made me salivate with each taste. The type and degree of extra spiciness mingle perfectly with my red duck curry.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Montreal just doesnt have a good Thai food selection. This is the best of a lot of bad Thai food Ive had while visiting here the past few months. Its nothing to write home about, unless youre writing home to have them ship you some decent Thai. However, If youre in Montreal and have a hankering for Thai this might be your best option. I had the the Pad Thai and while it wasnt the best Ive ever had it was ok."}
{"text":"I tried the Phad Thai and the Spicy Duck. Both were delicious. Really good food but really horrible service. Went there twice and we had to wait more than an hour for our main course. This would probably be my negative point. Very long service. Don't go there if you're starving, you might die of hunger."}
{"text":"Every review was right. This is the best Thai I have ever had. Something as simple as a spring roll was done just right. Hot and crispy, and the filling had the perfect amount of crispness.   The lemongrass coconut soup had a depth of flavour, with a great balance of hot/sour/salty/sweet.   I had the red curry duck, and the flavours were very well balanced and smooth.   Service was prompt and understated.   So glad we went there.  (This was from a visit in 2013, which I just noticed I had in a draft)"}
{"text":"Food as outstanding and really cute decor. Had a really nice evening AND THEN THE WAITER RUINED EVERYTHING.  He had the nerve to tell someone at my table that she didn't tip enough and that he pays taxes on 15%. Some nerve! That is the name of the game...sometimes you make more and sometimes less. For this and only this reason, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Plusieurs visites le midi,stable.local clair,belles couleurs,service sympathique.cuisine sans faute,bien présentée.vins en accord avec la cuisine.prix doux.merci"}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars but gave 4 because I like these neighborhood restos. Food was good. Not amazing, but good. Portions small, prices large. Service was very good. It's small so recommend to call ahead. This place is better as dinner for 2 (vs. as a group of 4). Dishes nicely prepared, and while portions were just right, it's not enough to share with your dinner companion. So it is poor value for the money. I would like to see better portions and more value."}
{"text":"Tried the tom yum kha and the lamb with red curry. They were both very spicy, and fantastic! better than any other Thai food in Montreal. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu. The service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"Very authentic Asian  Wonderful flavours and a nice variety of dishes that are fun to share Be sure to reserve, the place has limited seating and is always busy"}
{"text":"Galanga is more of an Asian-fusion spot rather than actual Thai restaurant.  We walked in expecting to see the regular stuff (e.g., Pad Se Euw, Pineapple Fried Rice), but we did not see anything familiar other than Pad Thai and this was only one of multiple disappointments in the night.    They first took extremely long with the food (about 40 minutes) before they went to check on our orders and discovered there was a mix-up.  The owner - or at least, who we perceived was the owner - was extremely apologetic and returned multiple times to check up on us.  Also, as additional consolation, they gave us 3 appetizers on the house: a shrimp appetizer, salmon tartare and vegetarian spring rolls.    Shrimp Appetizer: B Salmon Tartare: B Shrimp Pad Thai: B+ Tofu Phad pha ram kai: B  The decor is quite simple and mostly easy on the eyes.  I disagree with the current high rating and rate it a 3/5 at best; especially having eaten at many Thai restaurants throughout the East Coast (from FL all the way up through Canada)."}
{"text":"J'avais une envie d cuisine Thai mais yant été déçu de mes dernières expériences, je ne savais pas à quel Buddha me vouer. Qu'à cela ne tienne, j'ai décider de consulter Yelp et après quelques recherches et voyant que le Galanga était chaudement recommandé (en particulier par Janine) j'y ai donc réserver une table.  Premièrement il faut définitivement y aller par une belle journée d'été. La terrasse y est magnifique et nous fais sentir que c'est gaiment un restaurant de quartier. Le service y est super sympathique, la gentille serveuse nous renseignant bien sur le menu. Ayant le goût d'essayer plusieurs plat, nous nous sommes entendu pour prendre quelques entrée et 1 plat principal à partager. Les dumping aux arachides y sont excellent, je n'étais pas certain du mixte basilique et mozzarella pour de rouleaux impériaux mais c'est un très bon mélange. Le plat de cari rouge au canard est tout simplement sublime. La sauce bien relevée et crémeuse est magnifique et le canard fond pratiquement dans la bouche. Seul bémol de la soirée , les calmars frits sont assez quelconque et cahoutchouteux.  J'y retournerais assurément!"}
{"text":"Délicieux. Très goûteux. Le meilleur thaï depuis longtemps. Et de loin. Soupe Tom Yum crémeuse grâce au lait de coco, et hyper goûteuse, bel équilibre des saveurs (citronnelle, coco, cari) rouleaux (triangles) impériaux bons, pas phénoménaux, mais il y a tellement de beaux autres choix d'entrées. Mijoté d'agneau divin, avec très bon riz et genre de petites crêpes chaudes et épaisses mais légères avec ça. Miam! En plus il m'en reste pour un lunch. Et une très belle terrasse!"}
{"text":"Une tres belle surprise!  Ça fait longtemps que je n'ai pas été servie aussi bien.  Le patron est present et tres prevenant. La decoration est tres jolie.  Les dumplings et les pad thais etaient fait dans les règles de l'art.   J'y retournerai bientot."}
{"text":"wow.. so words cannot even describe the amaze-balls of this restaurant. legit Thai cuisine.. well cooked, well portioned, ambience was soothing, and great location. I ordered the shrimp sauteed with eggplant, which was spicy.. #18 on the menu and it was sooo goood!!! i can't even! i highly recommend this place... i wish they had thai iced tea to complete the whole Thai inspiration theme... bon apetit!"}
{"text":"I really did love this quaint Thai restaurant in the middle of Montreal! Was it everything the reviews said, and more? No. But I did love it!   First order of business, this place wasn't authentic Thai by any means, it was more of an Asian fusion, with a few Thai dishes.  I'll start by noting that the service was impeccable, and very helpful. Water glasses were taken care of, servers were polite, yet not intrusive. We went on a weekday, so it was a good place for quiet conversation. The music was nice and relaxing, and the atmosphere felt nice, and calm. I know that might be a weird thing to say, but often dinner is bustling and quick moving. It just felt like time had slowed down, and I could really enjoy my meal.   We ordered these dishes:   1. Tom Yum Kha - Soup - was decent, was a little more watery than I would have liked. If they evaporated more water out of it, it would have given it a creamier taste. Have liked this soup better in other thai places honestly, but it was ok.  2. Keang Mansaman Kea - Lamb stew in masaman curry with coconut milk, potatoes, carrots and peanuts - was good, the lamb wasn't as tender as I would have liked it, but the mansaman curry was tasty!  3. Pad Thai - was good, again, the flavor was a little thin, watered down, not to perfection, but was decent nonetheless.   Since I'm a little bit of a food snob, the dishes weren't to perfection, but good food nonetheless. If this is the best \"thai\" food Montreal has to offer, I'm gonna say, Montreal, WORK ON IT! For the food 3 stars, service and ambiance 5 stars, so overall, I'll give it a solid 4 star rating! Over and out!"}
{"text":"It is HOT! This is the exclamation on our table when we tasted our main course!  Yes, the dishes of Galanga are spicy and flavourful, a treat for Thai food lovers.  On a warm Saturday night we ended at Galanga's wonderful patio far away from the noisy F1 crowds. We ordered appetizers and their soup made with galanga (ginger like root as explained in the menu), all approved as delicious.  The restaurant offers a substitute veggie option for some of the dishes which is a wonderful idea. I chose the green curry with vegetables instead of chicken and it was perfect, a little bit above my tolerance for spiciness, but our waiter asked us if we are OK with spicy food and I said yes. Overall the dishes we had were rated five stars and it appears the mango sorbet is nice way to end up your dinner.  Service was pretty decent for busy Saturday night, our only complaint is lack of napkins on the table, but our host brought them immediately when we asked.   I need to come back as I didn't manage to try the ginger creme caramel. It is going to be soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place with a relaxing atmosphere and music. I had the chicken with spicy peanut butter sauce and it was likely some of the best Thai food I've had between Mtl and TO. A hidden gem. Do it!"}
{"text":"Maybe not the best Thaï food I had in my whole life (because hey, I went to Thailand and shit) BUT the best one I had in Montreal so far.  I always try the same thing when I go to a new Thai restaurant : the green curry chicken. And it was super yummy, and spicy enough. It came with some kind of nan bread (not really a nan but something like that) which was absolutely awesome.  Had some fried raviolis who came with a surprising crispy salad : Nomnomnom !   Only problem : I'd love it to be closer to my place ! Because I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Galanga is my favourite lunch spot in Outremont and has some of the best Thai in the entire city. The terrasse is perfect in the summer, sitting under big huge trees offering just the right amount of shade. The service is fantastic, things have a nice spicy kick to them, they are happy to offer take out, they can substitute tofu into almost every dish and the prices and quantities are perfect. Oh, and the soup that comes with lunch, mmmmm so freaking yummy!"}
