{"text":"Hit this place at Bally's a couple of times for their breakfast buffet. Good price. Not a huge selection, but the scrambled eggs and biscuits & gravy are both very good."}
{"text":"If you're here on business and in a hurry, beware!  The service is very slow.  You can choose the buffet, which is very pricey and doesn't include coffee or juice, and that's a little quicker.  They seem to be perpetually short-staffed in the morning.  I guess that Bally's figures that since this restaurant is the only game in town - or at least in the hotel - for breakfast, they don't need to make an effort to please their guests.

They are slow to seat guests.  One of the waiters is terribly rude, although the waitress on the last visit was delightful and did her best in trying circumstances. 

If you stay at Bally's, you either need to get up a lot earlier than you normally would or plan to skip breakfast.

There's a coffee cart near check-in, but there's no information about it, so if you don't see it, you won't know it's there. I wish I'd known about it earlier in my stay."}
{"text":"Sat outside for over a half hour and wasn't served. Had waitresses come out and totally look right past us. Worst service in a while."}
{"text":"Place doesn't look like much, but I go here all the time because I know I can count on GREAT SERVICE and FOOD! My boyfriend loves the corn beef. I am a Detroit native so I love the omelettes because they remind me of Coney Island."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Neat little spot inside Bally's. Nothing too exciting about it. The food was decent..., had pancakes, eggs, sausage and hash... The service was pretty good. Overall, a pretty good and inexpensive breakfast spot if your looking for something on the fly and quick."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I waited over an hour to get my sandwich only for it to end up the wrong sandwich.  Susan the owner is extremely rude and did nothing to correct the problem. If you work at Howard Hughes buildings, you are much better off to run to Panara Bread to grab a sandwich.  At least then you will know you got the sandwich you ordered and spend half the time."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here two days in a row last month.  I had the cobb salad both times, and it was pretty good.  The price was reasonable (10.99?), and the salad was quite large.  It was cheaper than a buffet, where I can't eat enough to get my money's worth.  I was alone, and got seated right away both times.  Had a very friendly server the first time, and a cold server the second time.  I would go back for that salad."}
{"text":"Located in this hole-in-the-wall restaurant with gaudy yellow and red exterior is some solid food for any time of the day. They serve breakfast all day and cater to the late night crowd. I tried the corned beef and a classic gyro, the gyro at 11pm and the corned beef the next day for lunch. 

The gyro was better than expected. The meat was tender and hot with the right amount of salt. The \"fixings\" added a nice coolness and the bite from the fresh onions was perfect. The onion rings were on the greasy side which may allude to problems with fryer temperature.

The corned beef was also good. The meat was lean and reasonably tender. The cheese added a nice creaminess to the beef, although I would have preferred fresh Swiss as opposed to American Swiss slices. The bread was perfect with a nice buttery taste and a beautiful crunch that added a nice textural component.

Solid restaurant with great servers that are welcoming to everyone. Good choice, especially if you're hungry late at night in Euclid."}
{"text":"This place is bangin, yo! Nothing like rolling up at 12:30 to some sweet disco music and great service. Definitely coming again. SQQUUAAAAD"}
{"text":"Typical Vegas buffet. I ordered the vanilla bean French toast with fresh berries. Very yummy and filling. But again typical $4.99 for a glass of OJ. Wait time at 1130 was about 30 minutes. It also took a long time for the server to come over and take our drinks order."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most on here about the service, Its really, really slow.
Food was decent just like any other cafe in the hotel. Does not surprise me, these cafes are old school. Something like back in the 80s. Time has change and food quality is much better and standards have gone way up. I expected more, dont know why! I guess the stomach in the end had the final saying. Don't come here on a late night, or you will be waiting 20-30 min when the place is has 20-30 open table.

Overall : decent, 3 egg breakfast $9.95, I had better, I mean I make it 
                                                                         better at home! HA"}
{"text":"While making my way back to New York, my travels took me through the Cleveland metropolitan area, as they sometimes do.  By the time I got to Painesville, it was lunch time, and after putzing around the downtown section of Painesville, I decided to go to the Sidewalk Cafe.  Conveniently located near a number of government offices (probably a healthy portion of their business), Sidewalk Cafe offers a number of breakfast and lunch menu options at very reasonable and affordable prices.

The decor of the restaurant was a throwback to the days of yore, plus the service was really fast.  Most of the seating is inside the restaurant, but they did have a couple of tables set up outside as well.  I decided to order a tuna melt on Texas toast.  This was one of the better tuna melt sandwiches that I've had.  I'll have to keep this place in mind for any future trips around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Perfect little breakfast dinner. Good food but waitress keep fight and arguing. It is not what I really wanted to experience 1st thing in the morning."}
{"text":"\"OK\" breakfast food...actually I am surprised a place of this calibur is still in Vegas given the options. I would only go there if the wait was too long everywhere else. Ordered the traditional 2 eggs, bacon, pancakes. I would go to Denny's for the same value.

Hubby ordered the club sandwich which was a lot better than our breakfast items.

skip the orange juice (straight from the carton) and bland coffee if you can."}
{"text":"A very below mediocre cafe that people probably go because they are too hung over or there is absolutely nothing else to eat.  Came here with a huge party right before they closed at 2pm.  The service is really slow here and  you'll have to ask for everything twice, that is if you can flag down a waitress and get their attention, but they were nice, just not very attentive. 

The food is not impressive at all.  My pancakes were were dry and I asked for soft scrambled eggs, which still came out looking like regular scramble.  I also ordered a plate of steamed vegetables, you know, so I can eat my veggies for the day.  Little did I know that the whole plate of veggies are completely doused in butter that glistens so much that I can see my own face.

Unless you really have to, there so much good food in Vegas, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Great food, great decor (occupies a previous 20s pharmacy so it's still got the old cabinetry and appropriate woodwork), great prices, great staff, great shakes, owned by Greeks, how can you go wrong? My only two complaints: it closes a bit early (4:30pm, but then again it opens at 5am and there isn't anything else in Painesville until at least 8) and they don't have a waffle iron, so you can get a stack of pancakes but no Belgian waffle. That always saddens me. But, I go with the reuben or gyro breakfast wrap and all of my troubles go away. Come here. Bring the family."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet is more like continental + some powdered eggs, imitation bacon, and sausage. It did not taste good or sit well. Drinks other than water are extra. Might as well go to Nosh if you are forced to eat breakfast at Bally's."}
{"text":"come hungry! Something for our whole family here. Burgers/ FRIES/ corned beef. Over the top. Been coming here for 20 years. Had been away for a few years and we had an event nearby. Why oh why did I ever leave. SO GOOD. fair prices."}
{"text":"Inedible. Powdered instant scrambled eggs, turkey sausage that looked and tasted like muddy leather, watered-down coffee that tossed tasted like chocolate syrup ($4!), Fried eggs that were so undercooked and covered in oil, I felt like I was eating a jellyfish.  Also the waitress was frazzled and inattentive.   Worst breakfast experience I've had in many years."}
{"text":"For sandwiches and salad-fare this place is affordable, fresh, delicious and one-of-a-kind - a must try for anyone in the 'hood or interested in trying something new.  The Veggie Kookoo is excellent and something new in my fairly large vegetarian repetoire of dishes.  Likewise, the Cutlets (beef, peas...chickpeas, i think, potato, onion) is also very flavorful, impressive, and a new discovery in my world of food, which obviously hasn't included much Iranian food.  I have also sampled the Chicken Pesto, which is tender and flavorful, though less intriguing to the tastebuds as the other two sandwiches and the Olovie (a shredded chicken salad mixed with kalamata olives and a bunch of other goodies), also good.  My boyfriend tells me the hummus here is the best he's ever had, but I've yet to try it.  Oh, wait, the coffee is also excellent, no burnt Starbucks taste here.  One last thing, I enjoy the congruity in design between the interior and exterior.  Have I mentioned, I like the place?

As mentioned in the previous review, the only downer are the unreliable hours of operation.  And I am predicting that once this place catches on, a future downer might be the wait and the limited seating (I have no idea what it's like for lunch).  Get ready to hire more staff, Mike!"}
{"text":"The food is just okay. The SERVICE  is horrible, let me be more specific the owner is awful!  The owner is argumentative but the delivery persons are very kind and prompt. I feel bad for her employees."}
{"text":"This is a really cute and inexpensive place to grab breakfast, lunch, or a really early dinner. It's in the old Thayer's Pharmacy building, and the restaurant still has that old timey vibe that I love. It's not very big and it's usually pretty busy, but I've never had to wait for a table. I love their sandwiches and their veggie omelets."}
{"text":"The food is great. In the past the service has been ok but now there is a wonderful new delivery girl named Tracy that is a pleasure to deal with. She brightens up our day in our office."}
{"text":"The food was okay I guess, not much better than subway (though twice the price), but the service was terrible. It took literally 30 minutes from the time printed on my receipt to the time we walked out with our food. There were two of us and we only ordered sandwiches, this shouldn't be rocket science. 

On a side note, they don't have it posted anywhere, but they charge you a fee to use a credit card. Not a deal breaker, but irritating when they don't tell you before they charge your card and then proceed to get pissy with you when you ask what the additional charge was for."}
{"text":"Service was good, there was three of us, we had 2 gyros a Patty melt and a basket of fry's. Gyros were on the dry side. Fry's were the best !! All in all don't think it was worth $30.00"}
{"text":"Yum, this place is great! I get the pesto chicken on a pita with cheese and roasted red peppers and it's awesome. Not to mention the owner is super nice, I just wish there was one of these closer to my house in Mesa"}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast when we are working in the area and its good. Servers on on top of everything and food comes out quick. The 2.99 sausage or bacon, with hashbrowns or grits, 2 eggs and a slice of toast is a great deal and what i stick with. Id give 4 stars but some of the other stuff on the breakfast menu is a little high in price."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast buffet here, and I don't think we'll be doing that again.

The food was mediocre. The service was actually pretty good. The setup of the dining area and buffet was atrocious. A long line outside to be seated, then a line almost as long to actually get food. The selection was pretty limited, as its basically a motel style continental breakfast. There is no live cooking, the \"omelets\" are just a warmer tray of dried out eggs covered with cheese. The whole buffet area is basically one small counter of warmer trays stuck in the back of the dining area.

With the rather long line to get any food, most people were double fisting with two plates. This, in turn, meant that the supply of clean plates was quickly exhausted, stopping the line from any further movement.

Finally, you don't pay when you enter. When you leave, you pay at a cashier counter, so there is often yet another line to wait.

All in all, really not worth the amount of waiting involved."}
{"text":"Place has been changing alot since I first went there. Staff was very friendly especially the beautiful young lady who made sure my order was correct"}
{"text":"I got the bagel and lox plate. I thought capers, smoke salmon, hard boil egg with a bagel sounded good but eh, it was okay. Not memorable or worth 12 bucks."}
{"text":"This is the place for having my comfort food. After a long and hard day at work, I escape to this place alone to enjoy the amazing service and great food. The burgers are always freshly made and the fries are crisp too. Nothing beats the feeling of being at home when dining at this place. 

I would be coming to this place everyday (if possible)."}
{"text":"I guess this is a good place to go when you're drunk so you don't see how dirty this place is, seriously, I walked in because my friends wanted to try it we walked out and got fast food and this was during the day when it wasn't even that busy!  I can't imagine what it looks like late night!  There is just not a way to describe how disgusting this place is.  I would  rather eat off the floor at chipotle then eat at this place."}
{"text":"The only thing worse then the food is the cleanliness and service.  They weren't even that busy.  Asked to talk to the  manager, very rude lady.  I won't go back and hope I can save someone for trying this place, go down the street to Jimmy's."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. I was expecting a lame salad but it was delish! Service was extremely friendly, and prices are cheap. The Greek salad with chicken is great and my colleague said the burger was juicy and topnotch. If I could add one thing it would be more sandwich options like basic turkey and tuna."}
{"text":"Blah~ Can't really expect much from a Hotel Café in Vegas... does anyone know of any good 24 hour hotel cafés in LV?

My friends and I went there for lunch when I was drunk off my a** from playing Beer Pong at O' Sheas (yes we started drinking around 10am) I ordered a barbeque bacon burger and thought it was SOOOOO good!  I remember taking quite a while to get our food but I guess I didn't really care when the food came.  I devoured that burger in less than a min.

.......................................................................................................................

My friends went back there after a long night partying at XS... We went back to the room at the same time they got to the café.  They came back more than 2 hours later b**ching about how long it took to get service. WTF? 2 hours??? I'm glad I got extra 2.5 hrs of sleep while they were trying to get food!

.......................................................................................................................

Yet we gave them another try... well more like we had no other choices.  It is no wonder that these cafés don't even have to try hard... They get customers that are desperate to eat all the time!  I decided to go for the safety and order the same burger I ordered before.  I guess I was REALLY wasted when I had it the first time because even the nastiest things you could ever eat LIKE THIS BURGER will taste good when you're drunk!"}
{"text":"FRAUD ALERT.  Do not, do not, do not, do not come here.

They lure you in with ubiquitous signs of $11.99 for brunch.  But, this is nothing but a fraud.

First, it is $11.99 for brunch, but hey, that doesn't include beverages.  What buffet brunch charges you extra for non-alcoholic beverages?

When you find out that there is an extra charge, it is too late.  You are already seated at the table.  Why? Because your menu makes it clear that there is an extra charge, right there, in bold, in red.  It's just that the 100 or so signs surrounding the hotel offering the $11.99 brunch conveniently don't mention that fact. 

Did I mention the entire buffet line is about 15 feet long? Yes, that's how many options you have in total, about 15.  

Bally's may have once been a decent casino, but it has had to resort to fraud to get customers in.  Truly sad.

For what they offer, $11.99 is not necessarily a good deal either.  I would have rather gone to the Flamingo and paid double for what they offer."}
{"text":"Ok, food is actually pretty good, especially for a late night 24 hr option. The building is old & kind of dumpy. They have breakfast sandwiches, omelettes, corn beef, cheese steaks, gyros & burgers. Prices are a bit high & service is about what you would expect when you first lay eyes on this place. If you are a degenerate gambler they have keno & lottery machines while you wait for your food. But a very good late night food spot..."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Sunday afternoon, had lunch while walking through Bally's casino.

We ordered a Cobb salad, half sandwich, two bowls of soup and drinks for $27, the service was friendly although was a little slow since the cafe was packed with people.  Overall the food was good and filling.  They do have specials on the menu and if you use your Total Rewards card, you will have a discount on certain menu items.

The cafe has limited hours and at the time I visited was only open for Breakfast and Lunch, closing at 2pm.

Overall, I would visit again, please keep in mind that this cafe does get busy but there are multiple dining options within Bally's to keep you satisfied.  The Sidewalk Cafe is located between the escalator and the Tequila Bar."}
{"text":"The two stars is for the food (which is decently priced, tasty and large portioned) as well as the delivery men and women who do all the running to the businesses of Howard Hughes Center.  They are fantastic.  However, I'm done eating here because of the owner.  She is inexcusably rude and treats you like something stuck to the bottom of her shoe.  She will walk away in the middle of taking your order, and just holds out her hand for your payment without even telling you the order amount.  Today I pointedly looked at the cash register and said aloud the total that I saw, and she glared at me.   The fun part was just a moment later AFTER she ran my card, the total on the receipt and register display was about fifty cents more.  It's not about the money, it's about the fact that I've continued to patronize the place and am essentially PAYING this woman to treat customers like crap.  I'm done with that and I hope others will make the decision to be, as well."}
{"text":"Count another one in for the 'never visit again' crowd due to the nasty attitude of Ursula ringing you up.  Their food is normally good, today not so much - overcooked and thrown together.  With more options in the area now, improvement of consistent quality and attitude should be on the forefront of her priorities but clearly it's not."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in on a Sunday for breakfast and ate at the counter.

We both had eggs, hash browns, and bacon. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was fantastically historic feeling.

The service gets the place two stars, though. First, the wait staff seemed to be one male and a bunch of women who made a very public habit of scolding him and being annoyed with him.

On top of that, our waitress showed very little interest in us. Most of her time was spent just beyond the end of the counter in a doorway where she was eating a plate of food.

Not sure if her dining interfered with delivery, but the food took more than 20 minutes to arrive at the counter.

After the food got there, I asked the waitress for a refill on my coffee, and she said, \"Sure\" but promptly when back to her plate and continued eating. When I asked her about it again a few minutes later she said, \"Ugh, I thought she was going to do it\" and pointed to another waitress with the coffee pot. She shouted across the place and asked the other to refill my coffee. 

Left a small tip. I won't be returning, though I really wish the staff weren't ruining the experience."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan of this place. First of all my lunch items always seem to be over cooked to slightly burnt. The price has absurd prices as well. I ordered a salad and soda and paid about 15 dollars for that. That's insane!! I could see around 10 dollars. They give you a small cup of dressing and charge you extra for an additional dressing. The owner woman isn't very kind either, a delivery person once told me she takes all of their tips and rounds up on your orders. I.e. If your already over priced burger comes to say 10.75 she will just up it to 11. This place is literally a 2 minute walk from my office and I order from a place a few miles away to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The worst service in the entire world I'm sure. They don't refill your drinks or pick up your plate. Five servers were just standing against the wall and they looked mad when I asked for help. Go to another place!!! Save yourself!"}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet isn't half bad. I have no basis for comparison in the land of post-debauchery buffets, but I can say I enjoyed my experience. The selection is pretty good, with heavier items like the chicken fried steak, traditional items like pancakes, eggs, and bacon, and lighter fare like oatmeal (which you order from a server at no extra charge). I raided the fresh fruit trays, which were full of ripe pineapple and melons, and I was actually impressed by the cheese omelets, which were almost as good as the ones I make (ALMOST!). Overall, at ~$12 a person, this is a pretty bang for your buck. Besides, I dare you to find a better value on the strip!"}
{"text":"\"The doggshit cafe at Bally's\" 

this was the worst food i have ever had.  Like because you are in Vegas they can pull that kind of shit....
 it was the worst way to end the best weekend ever, which is most likely why we got a seat in there right away....not one of four people finished their shit meal.....sending biscuits and gravy back because they were stale, and hard as a damn rock."}
{"text":"***This cafe in Bally's seems very similar to other casino cafes; their breakfast was satisfying***

Sidewalk Cafe is located inside Bally's.  We went here for breakfast.  It is not a breakfast buffet but a traditional sit-down breakfast place.  The decor is pretty no frills. 

The seating was comfortable, and the service was efficient.  I had the pancakes with bacon and eggs.  Everything was good.  And prices were reasonable.  If you are looking for a non-buffet breakfast place in  Las Vegas, this is not a bad place to stop.

Surprisingly, the restaurant sign seem to indicate that this place is only open for breakfast and early lunch.  The place closes at 3:00pm-ish.  You get this a lot at breakfast places in Los Angeles, but it was a little odd to find something like this in the always open atmosphere of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on with my fellow yelpers.  This place is amazing!  Delivery is blistering fast, and customer service is on par with other delivery joints.  

Notable items on the menu:
French Fries
Breakfast Burrito Special
Falafel
Turkey Chilli
Atlantic Grilled Salmon
Gyro Salad"}
{"text":"Well, it would have been a good experience, but it wasn't because the staff was very rude. My family and I decided to have a fun day out, but because of a very rude waitress, we didn't. Since I'm the only one in our family who likes tacos, I bought some tacos from a very good place down the street and brought them in with me  while the rest of the family ordered what they wanted. Before the food even came out, I was informed by the waitress that this was not allowed, even though my wife and two kids both ordered meals. When I asked why, she said because it wasn't their food. So if my wife and two kids had been in there alone it would have been fine, but just because I decided to join them for lunch, they had a problem. I suppose if I had just ordered a water, that would have been fine too. Also, we could see the rest of the staff talking about us in the back, and peeking over my shoulder to see what I was typing on my phone (this review actually) so it was a grand old time. We couldn't wait to get out of there, and I guarantee we'll never be back. It's not like the food is that special either. I never write bad reviews, but I really felt people need to be informed about this place."}
{"text":"Minimum order requirement for delivery is $7.00 and they STILL charge you a delivery fee even if you order more than that. 

The cheesesteak I ordered  was $7.95 based on the menu. After taxes, delivery fee, some weird additional .50 charge AND a $1 tip, it was over $11.00. That's an absurd price for JUST a sandwich that had nothing extra added to it. 

Plus, co-workers have found hair in their food more than once after ordering from them. They refuse to order from them anymore. I'm done too."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service delivers wrong orders. Quick delivery but if they can deliver that fast take some time to make sure the order is right first. Multiple people in my office have had issues and management was not at all accommodating."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced for being inside a hotel. The food is decent but service is not so great. Still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Location is okay! Service is fast and portions are great. However, I would have done better going to Penn Station to get a better tasting chicken Philly and fries. Food has no taste nor is it seasoned, but I'll try the other location first before I add them to my never try again list."}
{"text":"I'm attending a business meeting at a nearby hotel and one of the attendees took me to the Sidewalk Cafe for lunch. You'd never know it was there unless someone told you , as it's buried in the Hughes office park. If you walk along the right side of Coroprate Drive from Paradise for a hundred feet or so, turn right into a loading dock area and go up the stairs to find it.

The selection of sandwiches and salads is quite large. I went there twice so far - had a mushroom swiss burger with fries the first time, a blackened salmon Caesar salad the second. Both were very tasty and reasonably priced. If they are busy you may wait a while for your food, as the kitchen is small. If you know what you want, call ahead. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Two televisions were on (showing the same program) while I was there.

The Sidewalk Cafe caters primarily to the surrounding office park, but it is in easy walking distance from hotels on Paradise such as the Fairfield Inn, Emerald Suites, etc There aren't a lot of moderately priced lunch and breakfast opportunities in the neighborhood, so the Sidewalk Cafe is a good bet. Just be aware that they are closed weekends and holidays, though they were open on Columbus Day when I went.."}
{"text":"This USED to be one of my favorite stops while in Vegas. They USED to have great pancakes and they USED to have great mashed potatoes to settle a grumbly tummy after too much Vegas excess. They also USED to be open pretty much all the time.

No longer the case. Now the hours are VERY limited. Come on now. If I'm looking for comfort food at 11pm to get my second wind going it's not gonna be from here.

Lame move, Bally's. 

Lame."}
{"text":"Buffet food looks okie.  Drink extra but way cheaper than menu price $2 fresh squeeze OJ with the buffet.  I booked through orbitz and got $20 food and drink credit.  Not a poor deal on the strip."}
{"text":"I work nearby so this is convenient. They always have fast delivery and the philly steak is my favorite thing to order!! They have good food overall however I don't care for the salads, their ranch did not agree with my stomach and tasted a little funny."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with most of the reviewers, I feel like the prices are decent for the amount of food you get. They even deliver to the Howard Hughes offices for only $1. They do get slow during the lunch rush but they always try to make up for any issues. Super convenient if you work in the offices in the area. Great selection so you don't feel like you're eating the same thing every time you go. Perfect for a quick lunch pit stop."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to hit the buffet at Paris, however, the line was horrendous and we were hungry.  So, we wandered over here.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for out party of 7, despite the very emptiness of the restaurant.  Apparently the servers can't handle much...even though they have someone doing drinks for them. 

The menu was nothing to get excited about.  They did have things on the menu that they no longer serve though (espresso and cappucino).  I ordered the build-you-own-omelet.  Ther service was pretty slow...but I don't think we minded so much.  When the food arrived, I believe that everyone was quite satisfied with their food.  I was.  Nothing special, omelet, hash browns, toast...same withthe other orders.  

It was a little more expensive than it ws worth, but I suppose that is what you get in Vegas.  Overall, it was just meh...I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive staff. Nice outdoor seating - shaded and pleasant even on one of the hottest days of the summer. Unexpectedly good sausage patties. Decent milkshake. Toast is the buttery grilled kind. Yum.   Would go back again."}
{"text":"Used to be a 24 hour cafe.  Now it's limited hours.  Food is okay but it's on the strip and cheap."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 4 times.  Breakfast and lunch.  The menu is extremely varied, but I haven't found anything they do well, yet.  Salads: pretty boring - mostly iceberg lettuce.  The Greek food, gyros and falafel: mediocre.  The falafel were dry, flat patties and the gyros did not come off a rotisserie like I am used to.  I think the meat was bought premade and heated up.   Looked like that precooked bacon and tasted blah. And my breakfast burrito smelled like beef stroganoff.  How does that happen?  It was ok, but lacked flavor, which was surprising given the amount of cheese, salsa, and sausage in there.

They have pasta, grilled fish, chicken fingers, hamburgers, and other various items.  But I'm not willing to go through the whole menu.  If someone convinces me there is a certain dish they do well, I may try this place again but otherwise... nah."}
{"text":"Have been coming for years. First time trying the world burger. So good. Piping hot once I got home. Fresh cut fries. Very good"}
{"text":"Typical cafe with typical breakfast food. I won't sugar coat, this is barely an inch above Denny's but more expensive. 

Our waitress wasn't very good and wasn't very knowledgeable of the menus or prices. When we first walked in there was a sign that read $5 mimosas but the waitress tried to charge me more saying that I was incorrect, finally I walked to the front and asked if I could take the sign with me to show the waitress; the manager happened to be there and asked why, so I explained what happened and she immediately knew which waitress I was talking about and apologized because apparently theres always issues with this particular waitress. Immediately, the bill was fixed and the rest of the time the meal went without anymore issues.

I didn't enjoy my food, it was bland and small portioned. But I did enjoy the mimosa =]

First and last time here. Come on Bally's, you can do better than this."}
{"text":"I found a new place to stuff myself silly.  Seriously, the portions are huge, fresh, and filling.  

I walked in and right away the owner made me feel welcome.  He cares and you can tell.  I love that.  I also love the modern feel of the whole building that houses Sidewalk Cafe.  There are only a couple tables inside in addition to counter seating, so it's a quaint little operation.  There's also a couple small round tables outside, which I would love to see more of in this city- oh, I just got it, SIDEWALK Cafe.  I'm perceptive. 

Anyway, now for the good stuff.  I had the falafel sandwich.  It was full of huge pieces of falafel.  I kept thinking it was going to be over and every time I peeled back some more paper there was more freakin' sandwich.  I didn't want to be wasteful, but I was going to explode if I didn't get a to-go box for later.  If you're a big eater, this is your spot."}
{"text":"They should call it the Trainwreck Cafe. 
Service & most of the staff is colder than the food.
The seating was very limited & more than 1/2 the restaurant was empty & reserved for \"vip's\" , as we were told, so they crammed us into a tiny table in the middle of everyone's walk path, that was kind of awkward for everyone :/     No one ever did enter the vip area.
One of the new napkins had oily stains in it and some food was barely warm. We ordered coffee refills at the end of our  meal, and it took sooooo long for it to arrive we figured they forgot about us, so we left to pay at the counter. The waiter walked up to me ( at the cashier)  and said we should not have ordered refills if we were leaving, then he laughed, we were like  WT#*@ :/
This place used to be ok, but now with so many out of work in Vegas, one would think they could find some tallented or at least competant staff & management .           Keep Walking...PAST... the sidewalk cafe."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service and very affordable. Their weekday breakfast specials are perfect for those of us on a budget."}
{"text":"This is a terrific spot for a nice hearty breakfast or lunch. They don't do dinner, but they are plenty busy from early morning till early afternoon. They also have al fresco dining on the sidewalk, complete with umbrella tables! ( weather permitting) service has always been above average and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Keno and Brunch - go hand in hand?

This place is good if you go here once in a while.  But dont try the 3 days in a consecutive row - you will get tired of it REAL fast.

I think no matter what time you get down there, there will be a line to go in.  But the wait isn't horrible - about 10 mins or so.  

The brunch is okay.  Typical pancakes, waffles, eggs, beacon, etc.  The coffee is pretty good.  

The staff is okay, nothing to write home.  They are just there to do their job.  

However, playing Keno is a pain.  It took us like 20 mins until the Keno waitress came over and took our numbers, so that meant another 15 mins wait for the actual numbers."}
{"text":"At the Hughes Center for some training and this place was the only place in the area to eat. I am from Henderson and we have many choices near our office. It is clear that this place has no idea what real food is, well at least not good food.  I am sure that the location is the only thing that keeps this place open.  I have had better food from a hospital.  REALLY  ITS THAT BAD I am glad I don't have to endure this everyday."}
{"text":"This place is very convenient from my work place as it  in our building. It is quick and efficient, food is good. I am fan of their Blackened chicken salad. Little pricey for a deli, but not too bad."}
{"text":"This place is a dump, I got tricked into the beautiful sign for the breakfast buffet. NONE of the items on the picture were offered. It was the worst powdered eggs, greasy sausage, premade danishes, unripe fruit. I was grossed out. 
I'm not kidding-I've had better continental breakfasts for free at motels.
Not only was the food sickening, the 'chefs' were yelling and cussing to each other behind the syrup/danish area (I could see one, not the other).
I like Bally's and this place is a real disappointment. Even Imperial Palace/Quad has Hash House a go go. At least tear this place out and put a Denny's in."}
{"text":"I was at sidewalk cafe YEARS ago like back in the 90's. I didn't care for it much then server was not very good and just wasn't impressed. One reason why I haven't been there in so long. However I was in the mood for some diner food to go something different than what I have usually been getting  I saw the listing on yelp andit was on my way home so I said what the heck. I ordered on line and when I went in to get the food..... wow was it different than I remembered. No more servers just place your order and if you want to eat there order at counter and have a seat. If you want it to go pick it up and go.  Maybe it's under new ownership or management.  Any way the E-mail said my order would be ready at 6:23 and I got there a couple minutes early but I walked in at 6:23 and it was all ready to go. I got home and everything I ordered was in the bag nothing missing and even got napkins, condiments, and plastic utensils without asking. Every restaurant I have gone to that has corned beef claims to have the \"BEST\" corned beef in Cleveland. And of course they DO NOT.  but sidewalk cafe was really pretty good. I got wings and they also were quite good. I got the apple pie and they actually gave you a peace of pie not an overpriced little sliver. The prices were fair the employee I dealt with was friendly overall good experience. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. They have a menu that you can order off of or the brunch buffet for 12.99. I ordered off the menu and got breakfast. Eggs, hash browns, sausage, and toast. The usual. This place is pretty busy during brunch time but the food is nothing to rave about. Nothing special about what I had but then again it was breakfast so breakfast is usually the same in many places. I've definitely had better but it was at the hotel I stayed at so it was very convenient. Service was nice and prices were a little higher for just your average breakfast."}
{"text":"My sister and I shared the salmon platter for breakfast, and it was incredible. This is not your typical Vegas Buffet, so we ordered off the menu. Pleasantly surprised , as this place was unassuming. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious!"}
{"text":"Pitiful buffet and crappy service. We ate there yesterday and, well, they sure have mastered the are of screwing up a breakfast buffet. Today we went back to try and eat off the menu, and sat for 15 minutes with no service before we left. The front desk did not care. Ballys used to be a nicer hotel, like 20 years ago. These are the reasons they have trouble today, crappy food and bad service."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a number of years.  But I will say that the food is always good and service is great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, from the outside the restaurant  looked very inviting,  great location for downtown Painesville.  Once we entered the restaurant we noticed it was dark and wasn't as clean as you would expect for a restaurant. As for our meals we ordered grilled ham and cheese, a bowl cheddar potatoes soup which was said to be homemade along with a cheese steak sub. The soup was less then desirable, made with fake Cheddar. As for the steak and cheese sub we haven't seen restaurants use steakums which we're grey, in a very long time and we eat out a lot. The prices were high for the quality of food they serve. The positives were the French fries.  We feel this could be a great little restaurant if they would take a little more interest in the quality of the food they are serving."}
{"text":"The food is okay, and I agree with the another reviewer that the food is over priced for what you get.  I work in the Huges Center so I guess we pay for the convenience.  What I don't like is that the delivery persons do not carry any coin change on them so if you're paying cash and don't have correct change, they round it off to the next dollar up, which just isn't right.  I spoke with the owner and she told me to use a credit card if I don't have exact change.  NOT THE POINT!  She says it's hard for the delivery persons to carry change......................guess she's never heard of fannie packs.  Hoping that some of the newer eateries in Hughes Center will start delivering."}
{"text":"My food came warm after being 20 mins late. We work in the same Hughes Center area. Should have been either early or right on time. Called all 3 numbers and not one single phone number was answered. First and last time I'll order from here."}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped in here for a quick lunch after running some errands in downtown Painesville. It's a really cool looking old soda fountain type corner store that's probably been around since 1100 BC or something like that. What if I'm curious was that there were 7 waitresses working if it's time we went in there and there was about 7 people eating in them Restaurant at the time as well. There is an old adage that says if you have time to lean you have time to clean. In this case you have time to goof off and fart around on your phone. There seem to be a couple employees in the back of the house as well I'm don't know much about the finances of restaurants but I do know that you probably can't survive long selling BLT sandwiches and employing 12 people in any given time. The food was okay I had a BLT sandwich and a cup of chili. The chili was really good except for the large chunks of green pepper which I did not really care for. The BLT it was lots of bacon lettuce is crispy tomatoes refresh but what I found was that the Texas toast was very soggy with butter. I don't think they grilled the bread long enough for toasted it long enough for whatever they do to make it not soggy. I mean it was dripping wet with butter. Now I like butter as much as the next guy but I also don't want my bread to fall apart because is saturated with oleo. Overall if you want a quick bite it's kind of a neat place you get in and out fast articular server I believe she was training as she seemed pretty green but she didn't awesome job. It happened to be a restaurant of convenience for us versus a restaurant of destinations"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place while the rest of our group stayed in the hotel room sleeping because of the night before. I was so hungry I just wanted to eat anything. 

Fortunately the buffet had started here around 11am for 11.99 per person. (does not include drinks )

It was a Italian style buffet. Spaghetti , lasagna, meatballs , and Parmesan chicken. They also served a soup and salad.

I hate to say it but the food quality was very poor. My clam chowder was disgusting and the only thing I enjoyed from my plate was the fettuccine . I kind of stuffed myself with bread because I was worried I was not going to get my money's worth. 

I was surprised how cold some of the food was judging that they just opened the buffet right as we got in. We were even the first ones!"}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place and I love it. Everything on the menu is inexpensive and very good. Not sure what everyone else is complaining about to be honest. 
Breakfast omelettes and burritos are my all time favorite.
For lunch I have tried the Salmon salad, Chicken on a bun, Crispy Chicken Taquitos.
You can pick up for quicker service or you can have one of the lovely employees deliver it to you by foot (they do not drive)."}
{"text":"Decent food.. nothing fabulous. Also, DECENT prices.. eh. The staff doesn't make you feel very comfortable or homey."}
{"text":"We order delivery to our nearby office building several times per week. The food is fair to good and the delivery is typically pretty fast. 
Tip 1: call or walk-in before 11am to order breakfast items such as an omelet, however they are strict about not allowing a substitution for fruit instead of hash browns. 
Tip 2: the baja grilled chicken wrap is excellent and a healthy choice if you omit the cheese and request a wheat wrap (warning this wrap contains just the right amount of  jalapenos..but be sure to have something to drink close by)
A few times I've called when the delivery order was wrong (eg received the buffalo grilled wrap instead of the baja - there's a big difference in taste!) and each time I called to tell them about the mistake, there was a  skeptical \"tone\" in her voice (the owner?) and clearly not a sincere apology - the impression she gave was that they were doing us a favor by fixing or replacing it... 
But they do a good enough job for something quick and close-by, and the delivery option is a blessing in this area. They have a nice little area to dine inside at the cafe when time permits, and several outdoor tables with umbrellas to sit at on nice-weather days."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service even better. I work at an office nearby and they deliver fast."}
{"text":"I give it a Meh. The food is predictable and the ambience includes loud kitchen noises and people yelling keno numbers. Good fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"All grits, little omelette. I ordered a cheese omelette and grits. I got about 3x's the amount of grits than omelette. The portion of grits was impressive but the omelette was small. Good coffee and service though."}
{"text":"If you find yourself hungry in the middle of Bally's, Sidewalk Cafe might be up your alley.  Of course, it kind of depends on what alley you're used to.  If your alley includes OLD people, mediocre and overpriced food, as well as helpful but incompetent service, you've hit a proverbial jackpot.

My friend and I were supposed to have late lunch (around 3:30 pm) elsewhere, but that place was closed at the time.  Sidewalk cafe seemed like a reasonable option at the time.

We walked in and obeyed the \"Please Wait To Be Seated\" sign.  We stood there for 3-4 minutes before the hostess made an appearance.  All the while, the two cashiers were staring right at us like that Money You Could Be Saving With GEICO character, pretending not to notice us.  Finally we were seated at the booth next to a nice elderly couple.  There were hundreds of tables available, but Sidewalk Cafe chose to close off two large dining areas, making everyone sit within uncomfortable proximity of one another.

I ordered Cajun Chicken Fettuccine ($14.95) and a side Caesar salad ($3.95).  My friend ordered a plate of nachos ($9.95) for lunch, for which she got a lot of grief from me: \"Nachos, seriously?  How old ARE you?\"  However, she was the one who laughed last.  

The Caesar salad that we ended up splitting was pretty boring.  Everything it lacked in the flavor department, it made up with abundance of yucky Caesar dressing.  The Cajun Chicken Fettuccine was neither \"Cajun\" nor \"chicken.\"  There was a lot of dry chicken strips floating in the sea of tasteless Alfredo sauce and store-bought pasta.  My friend's nachos looked good enough by ballpark standards, not by restaurant standards.  I did not dare try them.  The portions were very generous though, although the prices did not jive with the quality of the food.

Sidewalk Cafe is seriously understaffed.  Our waitress disappeared for 5-10 minutes at a time, which added at least 20 minutes to our dining experience (read: subtracted 20 minutes from my poker game).  Although, can you really call it a dining experience if the waitress forgets to bring you silverware?

With thousands of dining options in Vegas, you might want to skip this place."}
{"text":"Cute place, good location.  Food is mediocre and slightly over priced.  $1.29 for cheese on an already $8 omelet is excessive.  Even then it's a slice of American cheese layer on top.  Gets the job done but nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Horrible...just horrible.  Bad service, under staffed, crappy attitude, long wait, longer wait for drinks, longer wait still for the food.  Did I mention the food was bad as well?  That's like 0 for 7."}
{"text":"I give this place props just for being open at insane hours. My friend and I were wandering around Vegas around 4am and needed to grub, and lo and behold, the Sidewalk Cafe is open! We sat down and fulfilled our craving for a nice, juicy, American burger, and that is exactly what we got. The meal wasn't memorable at all (perhaps due to being slightly buzzed in the wee hours of the morning, but I'll give myself the benefit of the doubt here), but I have no doubt this place will be receiving future business on future Vegas trips when I will definitely be in need of an extremely early breakfast ;). If you're starving in the middle of the night on the strip, swing by Bally's and hit up the Sidewalk!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The person who owns it didn't even know what on her menu had gluten in it. Only eat here if you're starving and desperate... And even then you might regret it."}
{"text":"We stopped here to grab lunch before heading into the Price Is Right stage show. There were about 5 parties in front of us and the overall wait to be seated was about 20 minutes. The hostess would seat one party and then do a disappearing act for a couple minutes, while the cashiers were awkwardly smiling at the parties waiting to be sat. Once we sat down, we realized that about 75% of the restaurant was empty, so then I was really irked about what the wait was about. 

The menu is sub-par, but the prices are not worth what you get. My boyfriend and I each got a bowl of soup and our total bill was $25. The Onion soup that I got didn't even have the cheese melted on the top, so that peeved me off even more than the waiting in line. Not worth the wait (in line or for the food), find somewhere else for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Awesome food and products. Great environment. All around great place to eat"}
{"text":"For what this place is, it's very good. They have an $11 breakfast buffet that's among the cheapest on the Strip, and the selection isn't bad. I've also been here for lunch, and I found the food to be pretty good and very low-priced compared to similar cafes around Vegas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I got there a little after 11, so missed the breakfast special for $2.99.  Ordered 2 eggs, toast, and bacon.  Expected to pay a little more than $2.99. Well got the bill and it was $11.00.  What did I get, the golden goose eggs?  Dont think I will return."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here and thought they did a good job.  The pastries, fruit, eggs and coffee were all solid.  I can't speak for lunch and dinner but the breakfast was just fine!"}
{"text":"Not a huge selection here. You have to ask a server for English muffins or bagels. I don't get that. The food was alright. Decent meal for a decent price on the strip. Don't expect a lot and you won't be too upset. Get the eggs with cheese if you don't like watery scrambled eggs. Scrape off the cheese if you don't like cheese with your eggs. It's that simple."}
{"text":"Always quick delivery and great food! Reliable for when we just can't make it out of the office but still want fresh food options. 
I've only had the soups/salads/sandwiches but they've all been delish. 
Also, they never skimp on the bacon. :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for lunch. Our last meal before leaving(we were in a hurry). She had the healthy start breakfast and I had the Blt. The eggs tasted like powder and the turkey sausage had the consistency of liver. The bacon in my Blt was dry and tasted old. There menu items are very limited. The service is great, but I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Man, this place takes me back to the times when sandwich shops were family owned and weren't part of some kinda chain. The place is small, but the food is excellent, served on bread or focaccia. The ingredients taste quite fresh, not broken out of deep freeze like a lot of sub places, although no subs here, which is nice for a change. For a nice treat, there is Baklava available for desert.

The Greek owner/manager is very friendly, and there is cafe seating out on the street, although like most places out here, I wonder why anyone wants to sit by a huge street or parking lot!! My only complaint is the rather unpredictable closing hours. 

Thanks for adding some local flavor to the area, Sidewalk Cafe."}
{"text":"Lil' update:  The veggie koo koo is amazing, kind of like an Iranian quiche or frittata, less eggy though and more herby.  Delicious and healthy.  

The hummus is also made by hand and is wonderful.

When I walked in there were 5 Tempe cops finishing up their lunch.  You know a place is good if cops eat there in groups.  

Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast the day we flew home and hoped it would fill us up , it certainly did and $13.99 including coffee is value for money ."}
{"text":"That Fish Fry Wrap was on point!

We were half an hour early picking up our vehicle that was getting detailed so, my family and I decided to grab a bite to eat.  Of all the places nearby, this place had the best rating.  Even though there were only five reviews we decided to give a shot.  

Being from Vegas, I was quickly reminded of home when I stepped into this joint, well, just a little.  They have Keno, Television and free WIFI for your entertainment.

They have a fairly decent sized menu from breakfast foods such as pancakes to skillets to burgers, sandwiches, wraps and even gyros.

What we ordered:

Fish Fry Wrap
Reuben Sandwhich
Chicken Nuggets

The fish fry wrap was, dare I say it, fucking delicious!  The fish was fried to perfection.  Crispy batter and soft juicy meat surrounded with simple lettuce and tomato and then wrapped in a flour tortilla with a light crisping served with a side of tartar sauce,  The husband had the Rueben, which was ok, but he was \"cray jelly\" for my crispy and flavorful fish fry wrap, especially when my greedy ass only allowed him one bite. 

The Reuben sandwich was OK.  As another reviewer stated, it would have been preferred to use Swiss cheese as opposed to the American and some sauerkraut...like a lot.  This sandwich was served on grilled rye bread with a side of Thousand Island dressing.

The chicken nuggets were made of real chicken meat, not your fast food chain variety.  They were fried nicely crisp and plenty juicy, served with a side of dipping sauce of your choosing.

Overall, the food experience was good and if we're ever in Euclid again, we'll definitely be by for some more fish fry and nuggets and maybe something else."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple stack of pancakes. OMG, they had no flavor and felt like they were previously frozen. How hard is it to make a good pancake! Even the pancakes at McDonalds taste better than these. The syrup was very runny and also had no flavor. I was so hungry I tried to eat them but became nauseated. The coffee was 3.99 a cup and no one offered to fill it and it was not that good either. The servers were arguing about breaks, really? Fill my coffee and stop arguing! Never again and will tell others not to waste their money."}
{"text":"6/2/13 4AM dehydrated and tired from partying. Walked up to the cafe, no line. Stood there aimlessly as the servers walked about without giving us any direction in how to get service. Sat ourselves (party of 7) in a section that was closed since there weren't any open, clean tables that were ready for us. Sat there for 10 minutes, and realized no one was going to come our way. Hailed down a server walking past us who was happy to take our order. The only downfall was that I suppose he was in a hurry to do whatever he was on his way to the kitchen to do in the first place prior to us hailing him down, so he didn't stay to hear the rest of our order. I'll give him a benefit of a doubt- perhaps he thought we were finished ordering? But after seeing another table who sat after us receive their water before we did, I thought I needed to speak to a manager. I walked up to the bar and the bartender said he would get the manager. After 5 minutes of standing I decided I'd wait for this \"manager\" at my table. Our order of 6 tacos and 2 margaritas arrived and still no manager. Finished the meal and still no manager.

#1. All servers should acknowledge guests.
#2. I don't care if someone's not sitting in a \"section\" or your section. Eventually there has to be communication between the servers and or management as to who's going to take the party. 
#3. You're always going to get customers who aren't sober. It's not an excuse, but it is true. I understand that one of our members was out of it, but don't walk away without completing the order. If anything call management to deal with the individual. If they see fit, they'll ask them to leave and trouble will go away. In our case, I believe the server was just being impatient. 
#4. Managers, where the heck are you? Your server's service is a direct reflection of you. In fact, I almost can't blame them for not knowing to how to greet customers, and serve patiently and serve fast- you didn't even show your face! WTF. 

As for the food? It was alright. I mean what do you expect from $2 tacos?"}
{"text":"I had never been here (or most places in Painesville) but a recent meeting found me in the area. I totally overestimated how long it would take me to get there (morning traffic usually sucks) and wound up an hour early. Thanks to Yelp I found this cafe near by. It's totally an older looking diner - several booths and a breakfast bar with stools. When I came in, I was greeted right away and the breakfast Rush was over (there were 2 dudes sitting at the bar, and people in 3 or 4 booths). 

I read the previous reviews and it seemed the biggest complaint was the service. I'm happy to report that I had great service. My waitress was training a new girl, and they both were nice. My waitress seemed to know pretty much everyone who walked in, greeting them by name. Regulars make me more comfortable with a place. 

I wasn't starving so just went for eggs and toast. My coffee cup and water were never empty, and the coffee was good enough (I never expect the best cup of my life or even great from a restaurant) - it had caffeine and hit the spot so I was happy. My table seemed clean and I appreciated that the waitress checked in on me without hovering or being annoying. 

Was it a fantastic breakfast? Nope but it was good and I ended up taking some toast home. Plus it was very reasonably priced. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was nearby I would certainly go back. Their lunch menu looked promising."}
{"text":"OK corned beef sandwiches.  They have 2 for 1 coupons which makes it worth it.  They have beer!  Only problem is they have lottery so all the gambling, zombie freaks suck up all the clerks time..ugh.."}
{"text":"Counter service restaurant that is open 24/7.  Frita took my order and was very kind woman.  She gave me some good suggestions and they were spot on. Kinda of a unique atmosphere with lottery machines and keno at the counter.  I got the large Rueben with a side of Fries and was not disappointed.  They do accept AmEx even though it is not on the sticker near the register.  Great experience for me as a Cleveland visitor.  Support local business!"}
{"text":"That may be a bit generous but depends what you're looking for; decent value but just seems to stale.  Even Denny's gone a bit upscale.

Ordered the ham and cheese omelette, nothing great, and the hashbrowns disappointing--no crispy edges, and even a bit soggy from either excess butter or oil lol.

Eggs were fine but ham also a bit salty and burnt for the wrong reasons.

But it's convenient if you're staying at Bally's and don't want to move outside this insane heat."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The breakfast was very good - simple and at a great price.  The staff was super friendly!!  The interior was eccentric.  You can definitely play the Lotto while you dine!! Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Come see Pam!!! Great service! Great attitude!!! All around a great time!!! Thank you Pam for being the BEST server we've had in Vegas anytime!!"}
{"text":"I had the ham and American cheese omelet with sourdough toast. Boyfriend had the corned beef hash. When I got my food I realized it was cheddar cheese in my omelet, I know cheddar is better and all but really I prefer American in my omelets. My hash browns were for the most part good, but there was some squishy grey bits which I wasn't 100% sure were potatoes. Toast was perfect I love sourdough! :) the corned beef hash was definitely fresh but I prefer it a little more well done the consistency of this was mush. And to pay we had to go up to the counter, I really hate when restaurants do that. All in all my food and experience rivaled with Denny's, at least at Denny's I can have a yummy breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, bacon cheeseburger and fries. I'm very critical of burgers because I'm a burg hag.

With that said, Sidewalk Cafe has one of the tastiest bacon cheeseburger I've ever had! Deeeeelish.

The service is pretty quick too. This isn't McDonald's; everything here is made to order so you do have to wait. But it's worth it and this is coming from someone who is impatient.

Eat in the diner or go through the drive-thru and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been to a lot of casino cafes, so I wasn't expecting much. We were pleasantly surprised this weekend when we ate at Bally's Sidewalk Cafe. We ordered the corned beef hash. It was freshly made, hot, and delicious. 'more of a combo of leftover meats- pastrami, steak, etc. and they used hash browns instead of diced potatoes. Otherwise, the waffles were excellent, coffee refills quick and often. All in all an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I spent a week temping at an office in the Wells Fargo Tower and I ate here twice. It is a little cafe that is connected to the tower and it obviously caters to all the businesses in the Howard Hughes Center business park. All the people coming here are employees from around the area. Surprisingly enough it is not super busy at Noon (lunchtime) as both times I went is was exactly Noon. However, they do appear to be a thriving take-out business. I guess most people these days just can't get out of their office, even if the place they're ordering from is just a few floors down from them.

Anyway, it's a nice enough joint with seating inside and out. They have a HUGE menu considering how small the place is. There are cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, plates (mostly Greek-origin), wraps, soups, and salads. 

On the two days I went I had a hot sandwich, the Turkey Loco, which was okay, but I just did not realize it was not going to have any veggies on it all. Guess that's my own fault. Second day I had the gyro salad. Basically gyro meat on a bed of lettuce, but it also comes with a dressing and tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, tomatos, and red and green peppers - yum!

I suggest going with the salads here because you get the most bang for your buck. The salads are generous and since you're paying so much (everything here is $6+) you might as well get the most out of it! 

Not too many people are going to just come here because they want a bite to eat, but if you find yourself working in the Howard Hughes Center this place will definitely do."}
{"text":"Seriously, I'd go negative if I could. I have NEVER EVER walked out of a restaurant in my life until I came here.

RUN DOWN DENNYS + SENIOR CITIZEN HOME = SIDEWALK CAFE

I got super trashed at XS the night before so I had to skip out on my reservation at Craftsteak. I didn't want to go there looking like a zombie. Sidewalk Cafe was the closest spot getting off the elevator. GF and I got seated farily quick. One girl taking order for drinks. Steak and shrimp dinner special for $11.99? Alright! Ok not really. 15-20 minutes go by. We are staring at each other like, \"Where the hell is our server\". Then we see 1 lady serving and bussing over 10 tables. 

Conclusion: Forget it! Downed our waters and walked out.

I tried to make a second attempt here because this is the ONLY place in Bally's that actually serves breakfast. But nope, that line was super long and I knew that line wasn't the only thing I'd be waiting in.

Attempt #2, failed."}
{"text":"a little pricey for lunch but you are paying for the convenience of not having to leave your office if you work on Hughes Center Drive.  Food is mediocre.  Delivery is fast and well worth $1.  Delivery people are friendly.  Good place if you work on Hughes Center Drive but I would never go out of my way to go here for lunch."}
{"text":"Whackattack... food here is comparable to denny's... the pricing is just double.

Only go here if you're desperate for food and can't walk any further.... like when you're so drunk after that crazy night at the club and walking 8 blocks back to your hotel with your feet bleeding out of the straps. Yea, that kind of desperation k.

I got fries here. And mm. they were delicious because I was drunk. But if i was a hungry kid from Somalia-- I still wouldn't eat shit here."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The only reason they are still in business is because there are no other quick food options in the Hughes Center. Less than friendly service and very average quality overpriced food ($8 greek salad with a few thin strips of meat, 3 tomato wedges, and a huge bed of iceberg lettuce). Not recommended."}
{"text":"Well, for out trip to sidewalk cafe, my gf and i weren't originally planning to go here. This was such a good choice for lunch though. a four dollar cheeseburger and paying a few extra for fries that tasted like fair fries..so good, cheap and delicious. the service was great... and the food was really good, it was a big enough burger to satisfy you but it wasnt over the top and too much. we love sidewalk."}
{"text":"Terrible for breakfast buffet.  I don't think I had one item that was edible.  Will not be going back here."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 

We met our friends for brunch at the Sidewalk cafe because it was touted as a good buffet for the price ($11.99) I was sorely disappointed when I saw what they offered. It was a pathetic one span offering that had: Scrambled eggs, potatoes, Cheese Omelettes (Which was Scrambled eggs, folded over and topped with cheese), Sausage, Bacon, croissants, fresh fruit and a few assorted pastries and donuts. THAT's IT!  And drinks were a separate purchase. I was -floored-! 

At my hotel, brunch was $14.99, they served -everything-, and I mean that. There was no comparison, really and drinks were included in the price.  

And let's talk about the service. What little there was, you know, to get the drinks we ordered, it was so very slow. 20 minutes after we placed the order to get coffee and Orange Juice (Which was tasty) we finally got it. It wasn't as if the place was busy, because it wasn't, not at all, I counted 5 tables, the service was just that dang slow. GAH!

I would -not- return."}
{"text":"Checked out and don't want to search for food.  Why not this place?  Well also because my aunt had some points to use.  So why not?  I ordered a corned beef sandwich.  It was good.  Except the sourdough bread scraped some tissue from the roof of my mouth.  The bread was hard.  The food is actually bland.  The only thing I really enjoyed were the fries...when they were still hot.  Sandwich?  Not so much."}
{"text":"Fairly typical casino coffee shop.  The service level we received was decent, and the breakfast was quite tasty.  I opted for the Eggs Benedict, and washed it down with some coffee and freshly squeezed OJ.  We were there right at 8am and the wait was only 10 minutes or so.  Food came out in fairly quick fashion as well so overall, not too shabby.  If I happen to be back inside Bally's again I'll most likely grab another bite to eat at the Sidewalk Cafe."}
{"text":"Great apple pie a la mode. Onion soup was okay.

We didn't want to be late for our Jubilee show and didn't have the strength to trudge it back to our hotel, eat and come back. So someone directed us to this joint.

While waiting to be seated, we had our doubts. The energy of this place was so low. The tables were placed far away from each other as if they had to accommodate wheelchairs or walkers. The patrons were elderly.  But we were tired and hungry.

The coffee was good and while everyone in my party ordered apple pie a la mode, I wanted an onion soup as well. The pie was worth the wait. It was SOOO good. 

The next best thing was our server. She had a smile on her face and she was friendly and on the ball which seemed rare during our 7-day stay at vegas. 

I can't say much about the food though but it seems like a feeding place for those who have no time for conversation because their goal is to eat and go back onto the casino floor. 

I would probably have gone back if Bally's just wasn't so errie. If you check out Vegas' most haunted, Bally's is one of the top places."}
{"text":"Hey! Its a hotel/casino cafe. What else you expect for a late breakfast?! It was pretty good. I recommend splitting the American Breakfast with somebody if you can eat a whole lot in the morning like I can. Price wasn't too much either... Even for Vegas. Servers were nice, like with your diner attitude :) 

I don't understand how some reviewers can also give a hotel/casino cafe like the Grand Luxe, The Henry, etc (luxury hotels) such poor reviews. While Ballys may not be the most haute, or chic hotel on the strip these days, the cafe is pretty good- I mean those cafes ARE definitely tastier than Sidewalk Cafe. But I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I honestly was really shocked when reading the previous reviews. It is very obvious this is a family owned business and I felt very welcomed. I ordered the chicken kabob,considering an employee mentioned it was one their most popular items. I definitely would come back to order this again."}
{"text":"Great food! Lots of choices! Fresh food prepared in a timely manner. Reasonable prices and good service! I stop in for lunch all the time. Too many favorites to name. Everything is very good!"}
{"text":"The Sidewalk Cafe was a quick stop for lunch as we were passing through Cleveland. We had the World burger and corn beef and Swiss on rye. Both were delicious! Fries were fresh cut and very tasty. The place was a little divey but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Had a few comp nights at Bally's a couple weeks ago. Saw the sign for a $11.99 express breakfast buffet and decided to give it a try one morning. Decor is ok. It seemed somewhat busy. I was seated right away since there was no one waiting.
The buffet line consists of the main breakfast staples. About a dozen items. Nothing flashy or extravagant. But it's hard to beat $12 buffet on the strip. It is an extra charge if you wanted a beverage aside from water. It did seem to take forever for a server to find me to get a drink. I was done with my 2nd serving before a waitress found my table and I got a water.
Just a no-frills cheap eats if staying or near Ballys. It might be some people's thing and some I'm sure would find it horrible. For the price, it's about what I expected and I am well aware how expensive it is to dine at strip casino spots. Of course, the locals weekday 50% off Rio Carnivale buffet is 10x better. Weekday breakfast comes out to around $15 if I recall correctly. Although I know that offer has just recently ended.
Could do worse but if one is looking for another option in Ballys. There's Nosh open 24hrs & Java Coast near the front desk for breakfast also."}
{"text":"Love that I can order and pay online now. My food was ready to pick up and delicious. Portion size large. Plus the little things make it clear they're paying attention. Seasoning, garnish, extra napkins, extra sauce on the side; so many places just can't seem to get this right. I was greeted right away, very friendly. Take-out for lunch couldn't be easier, and when you only have an hour, that's important. I love sitting down at the counter for breakfast too."}
{"text":"So I know I really shouldn't expect much of a Thanksgiving dinner from a hotel cafe, so I really didn't order the turkey... but even for regular cafe food - I was sadly disappointed.  

Located in Ballys hotel, the Sidewalk Cafe has a wide variety of foods ranging from breakfast to sandwiches and burgers to pasta and steak.  We ventured to the cafe on Thanksgiving evening and were pleased that we weren't waiting in a 2 hour line.  Despite the short wait time, the service felt as though the place was jam packed.  Most of the menu ranges in the $10-$15 range.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich which is like a french dip.  I was very disappointed when I received my food and my french fries were no longer warm and my sandwich was too large to even put into my mouth! The meat was pretty dry and I was hoping that it would be okay since they provided me with aus jus sauce - I was wrong.  The sandwich also seemed to lack flavor. I added salt to my meat, but it didn't seem to help.  Also, I'm a huge ranch lover - and was VERY disappointed that the ranch dressing just tasted... off... I even stropped dipping my cold fries in the ranch because the taste was so... off.

All in all, the others in my party seemed to think that the food was \"decent\" but with so many places to eat in Vegas, I'm not too sure I'd go here again by choice."}
{"text":"Very old cafe. Quaint and nostalgic. Floors look like a dirty garage which is unappealing. Also the containers of brown garlic cloves in an unknown liquid on the table is unappealing. But the hot chocolate was good."}
{"text":"Located inside Bally's.  This place would get 4 stars, but the service was absolutely horrid.  We waited 20 minutes for a table, and there were plenty available.  And I mean PLENTY.  Our waiter took forever to do anything, but at least the food was yummy.  Since this was one of the only places that served breakfast in the afternoon, I was gladly ready to eat there after waking up with a killer hangover.  I ordered a traditional breakfast with eggs, bacon, wheat toast and hash browns.  Orange juice was $3, which made me squeak a bit, but then I remembered that I was in Las Vegas.  

Greasy breakfast food good, shitty customer service baaaad."}
{"text":"Overall rating is 2.5 stars out of 5.

So my wife and I decided to go here for breakfast. The service here is a tad bit on the slow side even with very few people in here.

Ok so I forgot the name of the meal I ordered but do remember what the meal contained: Eggs, 2 sausage links, hash brown, toast, and 2 pancakes. I can tell you that the food looked better than it actually tasted. I mean the food wasn't nasty but I've had better. 

The eggs were bland and didn't have any real taste to them, so I had to put some salt on them (Not a good idea if you have high blood pressure). The toast was actually good, it was nice and buttery. The 2 sausage links and the hash brown were ok I didn't have any issues with them.  Finally the pancakes, although they were pretty sizable and looked very good they really didn't have any real taste just a lot of fluff.

I think the meal here is plentiful and looks good, so it can satisfy you if you are hungry but I don't think it will satiated toggle taste buds. But they that was breakfast and just one item, maybe their other breakfast or lunch items taste better."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for breakfast one morning on our trip to Vegas.  It took a while for a server to greet us, but it was pretty busy so it's understandable.

We ordered our food and it came out at a reasonable time.  At first glance the food looked great.  The dishes there come in large portions and there's no doubt you'll be full.

I ordered the smoked salmon breakfast thing and when I got it it looked pretty good.  That was until I reached the last of my tomato.. found some.. weird.. brown stuff. I decided not to eat the rest of it because I didn't know what in the world that thing was.

Aside from that, everything else seemed to be well.  It's a good place to go and it's very convenient if you decide to stay at Bally's."}
{"text":"I went there recently for breakfast and even though the food was good the staff is horrible. They were gossiping very loudly and were very rude when I had to ask three times for a coffee refill. I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 was impressed by the service. Billy & Sal both treated us as guests in their home. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #9 - #365 


A classic Vegas favorite that's soon to close because Caesar's Palace has filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It's a pity that Caesar's Entertainment has nothing but bad news for their deteriorating resorts and layoffs to come. I'm glad to have had my last breakfast here as it will be the last of the classic affordable Vegas eats on the strip.

My Dad was a Platinum Casino Rewards member so fortunately we didn't have to wait in the long line. Service was speedy and our waitress was very attentive with refilling our drinks. You had an option to eat on the buffet or order on their menu. Food was just average as well as the prices. It didn't break the bank at all. 

From the buffet I had scrambled eggs, bacon and some toast. Nothing over the top just the basic breakfast eats. The rest of my family just ordered from the menu and I wish I had done the same thing because their buffet had really limited selection. 

It was just like eating at your typical Denny's American Diner with some keno on the side. But unfortunately it will all be demolished for a new eatery with increase prices."}
{"text":"Yesterday I checked out of Vegas. Since I was staying at Bally's I came here for breakfast. There are two menus for breakfast: regular menu and buffet. For the best value I decided the buffet. Unlike eating at Le Village Buffet at Paris Las Vegas, I wasn't planning to get a lot of plates. I wanted to get just enough plates to satisfy my hunger throughout the whole day as I was leaving from Vegas to LA to San Jose. There aren't a lot of items on this buffet. The items here resemble a continental breakfast buffet at a hotel in Orange County around Disneyland. It's nice for that kind of hotel, but not for a casino and hotel in Vegas. The first plate I got included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and country fried steak. For the breakfast buffet toast and cereal was included. So for second plate I got sourdough toast and oatmeal. The second plate was the best plate for the whole buffet. Inside the sourdough toast was moist as if it came right out of the oven. The oatmeal with brown sugar was soothing dish for breakfast. The last two plates I didn't take pictures as I forgot or didn't care. The third plate was portion of cinnamon roll, a donut, and country fried steak. The last plate consisted of fruits like watermelon and pineapple. So if the second plate, which consisted of sourdough toast and oatmeal, was the best plate of the whole buffet why didn't I give this buffet a lower rating? As a Total Rewards Card Member I got about a fifty percent discount for the buffet. Instead of paying about $13 including taxes I paid about $7. Is this buffet worth $13? No. If you're a Total Rewards Card Member is this buffet worth $7? Yes."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. This is not a true Vegas breakfast buffet. For 11.99 you get scrambled eggs only, pre-made \"omelet\" which is and egg with cheese and not much else. To throw salt in the wound they add $2 for coffee and or juice. Rip-Off. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast :) The staff are very nice and the breakfast is very good!! Recommended."}
{"text":"I was passing by this place on my way to monorail and got my attention, there was always line. I decided to try on Saturday morning. Line was long as usual. There was a picture which showed all you can eat breakfast buffet for $11.99 at the door. What I did not realize was that this only covers water. Any drink was extra. Coffee was $2 extra. After 20 minutes wait, I got a table. Went to buffet right away (you can also skip buffet and pick something from their menu). Buffet was basic, scrabbled eggs, sausage, ready-cooked cheese omelet, muffin, donuts, some pastries, bacon, sliced watermelon and melon, potatoes. I picked some and came back to my table but there was no silverware, I had to track down my server to get one. I also waited 10 minutes for my server to come and get me a drink. It looked clean, all tasted okay, decor was simple. There are better places for breakfast if you can give couple of dollars more. May repeat if there is no line because of it's low price."}
{"text":"He said, \" Yea we went here for lunch only because we wanted to use our comp. I had a regular turkey club which was good with a side of onions rings. I don't think the prices matched the food is why they are only getting three stars. You can play this crazy game called Keno while you wait for your food. I tried to play but the game didn't make sense and the grandma who collects your ticket didn't feel like explaining to me...anyways if you want a quick lunch this is the place to be. Nothing fancy here...considering your in Vegas...something needs to stand out.\"

She said, \"Eh i would have rather went to mcdonalds or something. This place was kinda plain and boring. The wait was pretty long too for just sandwiches. I got the turkey melt and my boo got the club. His was pretty good and my melt was pretty regular. Nothing too special about this place. So yeah....thats why we only gave 3 stars, it was just okay.\""}
{"text":"Food not so good. Very bland. Just tried breakfast,probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm just finishing up eating as I write this.

Let me start by saying that this place is tiny, and I mean TINY. 3 tables and 6 bar stools tiny. But the food is GOOD.

I had the Gyro (a usual safe bet and item to judge by) and was very happy to see the meat carved right off the spit in the kitchen.  Wrapped in a nice fresh pita, with an nice tangy tatziki that was enough to get some in every bite, but not overpowering. The gyro was topped off with some chopped lettuce (not iceburg) and to my suprize pickle halves. Yummm.The fries were cooked to order, but needed salt and un remarkable.

The menu offers breakfast all day and one of the lunch items is Beef Tongue (that Jeff wants to go try)."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Cleveland I make sure I stop at the Side Walk Cafe for a Corrned Beef sandwich and fries! There are very few places in Cleveland where you can get good Corrned Beef and this is one of them! There is not much to the atmosphere but if you can get by that you will walk out with a pretty good sandwich!"}
{"text":"The server was excellent! She was friendly, explained everything, and even went out of her way to give us extra items! We tipped her well.

On to the food. Most of the items on the menu were a decent $9.99 price. For some odd reason I just wanted chicken wings and onion rings, so that was what I got. The wings were sort of pink ish inside... wtf? They were okay, glad I didn't get a stomach ache afterwards. The hot sauce  that came with it was good, it had a good spicy kick. Onion rings were onion rings. I ate it the next day after EDC and it was the best tasting thing ever atm. My friend had the steak and eggs which she enjoyed. My other friend had the philly cheesesteak which were HUGE and came with plenty of fries. Decent tasting. 

Would I come back here? Definitely not. It's a sub par cafe that only got the job done. We got tired of walking and just wanted something cheap and decent. If you're stuck at Paris/Bally's area and don't want to go far for food, this place will do the job, esp breakfast (got lots of breakfast items on the menu). Don't bother coming here from other parts of the strip."}
{"text":"My friend and I had the breakfast buffet here at Sidewalk Cafe when we were in Las Vegas and were not impressed at all.  The place was packed (which was expected) but it was definitely not worth what we paid.  The pancakes were pretty small and on the dry side, the scrambled eggs were really runny, and the sausages were not good at all.  There was no bacon?  We were really surprised because this was supposed to be a buffet and we got there pretty early.  It didn't come with juice, just coffee.  Denny's is way better, I wouldn't recommend dining here."}
{"text":"We tried the World Burger.  It was great. Very tasty.  The fries...kind if greasy, just ok.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"The restaurant was great!  I ate there for lunch today with a colleague.  I order the veggie kookoo and was very pleased!  My colleague had a chicken pesto sandwich, and she was also happy.  The baklava she ordered was microwaved on the spot, so it was served warm.  There is a nice array of bottled beverages to choose from, including diet iced teas, sparkling juices, and yogurt drinks.  The cook also offered us a variety of healthy chips.  The place is small, and it looks pretty inside, especially the flat screen tv with CNN showing.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was hands down our least favorite meal in Vegas. We stopped for lunch as we were passing through. The menu has a good selection but we weren't impressed with the food. The food we got was clearly from frozen and was nothing special. With all the great dining options around, there's surely better good around!"}
{"text":"Run don't walk away from the express breakfast buffet. Way overpriced for inedible food. I've had better free hotel continental breakfasts. This place is horrid."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on our last day in Vegas.  I was not impressed, but then again you can't expect too much from a cafe inside of a hotel in Vegas.  

I had the All American Breakfast, which came with eggs, meat of your choice, and french toast or pancakes.  I chose to have the french toast and it was ok, but the syrup was very watery.  The eggs were edible and the bacon was actually cooked how I like it (a little crispy).

My friend got a ham and cheese omelette and we laughed when it arrived because it looked like they threw a Kraft cheese single on top of it to melt.  She said there was way too much cheese inside.

Edible food, but not my first choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"The corned beef is great, just wish they didn't put so much butter on the toasted bread. Their open late night, and have a drive thru window, or you can sit inside and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"If you like fresh food with a home-cooked taste, variety from breakfast to sandwiches to burgers to full-blown entrees, fast service plus delivery, you will love this place! I have been a regular customer for over 9 years, and I'm never disappointed. I must add that the customer service is also appreciated. I highly recommend choosing this restaurant for breakfast or lunch if you work in the Howard Hughes Center, as the prices are very reasonable, they deliver, and the food is great! Best Blackened Caesar Salad I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!   They have the WORST food!  Absolutely disgusting!  The quality is worse than the nastiest of dive bar food!!!  The only reason I have ordered from here more than once is because it is close to the office and the office orders for meetings and delivery is cheap.  I've tried a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was so over cooked it was as tough as beef jerky and seemed like it was reheated from the day before.   I ordered a chicken salad sandwich one time and it is supposed to come with pickles, but it had no pickles so the next time I ordered it I added in the comment section, \"Please do not forget the pickles\" and they charged me .75 cents for the pickles that it is supposed to come with.  The chicken in the chicken salad is cubed processed meat and I got horribly sick after eating it.  I refused to eat here ever again!!!!  The OWNER IS THE RUDEST PERSON I have ever come encounter with! The employees have commented how RUDE the owner is. The only reason this place is still in business is because they deliver to the surrounding businesses."}
{"text":"The only reason this got two stars is because the eggs and bacon was good. Other than that, my experience sucked. It was the most awkward experience I've ever had at breakfast. For one, the place stunk! It's old, and smelled of dust. All the 'decorative' shelves were dusty, too. Then, we had to ask for a refill of coffee, after watching the gossipy high school girls heads down texting for 5 minutes. I glanced over later noticed two girls whispering who then started laughing and looked directly at my table...noticed I saw them, and looked away. One of those girls was our waitress. Awkward! And the music was extremely loud. So, while the food was good, thanks to the cook, our service was poor and the place was dirty. I stiffed her on her tip, too...and I never do that! Being an ex server, my husband and I usually leave 25% tip averages.

Try Jimmy's one block up if you want breakfast!"}
