{"text":"I have loved this restaurant, nice change of pace for area. Also have had issues ordering, kids behind sneeze guard learning customer service but pizza is good and love the Char house salad. Wondering if they changed their ranch dressing and crust lately? Seemed different on our 6 visit. They have great options for beer and wine. Favorite pizzas are the meat lovers and Piandina and cheese, though I was just told they won't have provolone cheese anymore."}
{"text":"Love this place! Our family really enjoys the patio! Great bruschetta, salad & pizza!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Nothing better than pizza with crunchy crust and Char definitely does it right! We've been in here 4 times since it opened and have never been disappointed. Such a cool make it your way concept, really quick, great topping options, and the staff is always really friendly and attentive too. The decor and overall vibe of the place is really cool too - laid back, great for families or a date night with my hubby.  Great outdoor  patio, great music, and cool little bar in the back to watch some football!   Will definitely be our go to pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Clean, nicely decorated pizza place. The Margherita is simple and delicious. Ingredients look fresh and the service is friendly. Every time I go it's in the late afternoon so the place is pretty empty and the service is fast.  I would like to try the bruschetta... have only tried the pizza so far."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Good service and family friendly environment. Fun games on the patio like Foose ball, connect 4 and bag toss. After having a very rude experience at a different restaurant I felt the need to share good, honest, family reviews on places we enjoy. Thanks Char, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"First time here, not what I was expecting but good flavorful pizza with fresh ingredients  Not a sit down and place your order type restaurant, more like Papa Murphy's but they bake the pizza.  Great Caesar salad that was large enough for 2.  Pizza's are personal size, but a 12 inch pie was enough for 2 as well.  In a nutshell, good pizza, service and not over priced!"}
{"text":"We always order 1 margarita pizza & 1 meatball pizza! Food is delicious! Staff is courteous! Environment is pleasant! Highly recommend CHAR"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch.  The atmosphere was very pleasant.  The food was really good.  I had a custom pizza and feel that it was reasonably priced.  The service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion.  I was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther Yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews.  The fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on.  My advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I, just keep on coming back for more!!!, take out too...  We love their pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I waited until my second visit to post this review.   There are some inconsistencies they need to work out. I noted some pizzas come out of the oven with a black char around most of the crust and others mostly white. They need to decide which works best and train the staff for the preferred outcome.   On neither of the two visits was the bottom crispy. My experience with wood fired pizza is that the bottom should be at least slightly crispy. It was not doughy but somewhere in between. I attribute this to the fact that their crust is a little thicker than typical wood fired pizza.   On my second visit I asked if it was possible to make a crust slightly thinner. One of the cooks stated that he believed the pizza would then stick to the peel when they tried to slide it into the oven as the sauce would permeate through the crust.   The cheese on the margherita pizza was a little on the skimpy side. On the second visit I requested extra and they happily complied. However they did not charge for it. Nice for me, bad for the profit margin ( :   My son ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni meat itself is wonderful. It has great flavor and the edge of the meat browns just as it should when a quality product is used.  My espresso was made perfectly and my son's cafe latte was made just right.   In regard to service all the staff was helpful and friendly. The manager may wish to spend more time ensuring the product is consistent.   There was a bottleneck at the serving counter when they were busy. There was a little confusion on the staff's part trying to figure out  which food belonged to which order and the way the serving area is designed the traffic flow makes it a difficult to figure out how to maneuver out of the area with hot plates. Perhaps they need to adjust the spacing of the opening.    Also it is difficult to cut a pizza on a plate. They may wish to cut the pizza on a small wooden cutting board and then slide it onto the plates or develop another method.   All in all a decent start as the first week or two is always the most difficult to manage."}
{"text":"This place was good! My wife and I found this place while looking for a place to eat on Friday night. It was packed with people but we still went in. Everything about it was great. They made their pizza from scratch and you choose the type or created your own pie! All the ingredients were in front of you and they were FRESH looking. The pizza was then put in a custom oven and they serve it to you at your table quick! They made a mistake on my wife's pie and forgot to add a topping that she asked for but gave her that pie too as an appetizer. The service was awesome and I believe the one the family member/ owner came by to see how everything was and we said, \"Great!!\" Beers and wine was also available, we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Char and we loved it!!! So excited to have such a unique, family-friendly restaurant in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to visit this place for a while because there are so many pizza places in the area, but when I finally went in I discovered exactly how different this place was- and how much better the quality is! When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was the VPN certification which told me right away that this place was authentic.  The ordering process is fairly easy, you tell the workers what you'd like while a girl takes down your order on a station nearby. She'll then ask if you would like any salad or bruschetta and was very nice to me when I made some complicated changes to my salad order. At the register, I was asked if I would like any desserts and decided on a cannoli after being convinced by the owner's mother. They were delicious! I highly recommend a cannoli or a tiramisu!   When I got my pizza, the prosciutto and fig, it was cooked to perfection! It had the perfect amount of arugula and glaze to give the pizza it's rich flavors. I was checked on multiple times by the staff who were all  very friendly and would make good conversation with me about the restaurant. I highly recommend this place as a casual lunch spot or even a dinner date out! Definitely coming again and again!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. We keep going back. We went on Tues, which was a great idea due to a deal they we're having. They also have amazing ranch. I def suggest eatting here, the only thing I can say bad is it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"What a cool concept!!  Fast & delicious Clean & cool atmosphere  Great ingredients  Tossin' dough before your eyes Wines on tap!  We will be back indeed!"}
{"text":"The pizza's okay, but WAY too over priced for the quality/quantity of it, in my opinion. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love their food, and atmosphere! The staff is always nice, and efficient. The place is always sparkling clean."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes just like it does in Naples Italy! Finished dinner with delicious Nutella cheesecake, homemade cannoli and Lavazza espresso. Great atmosphere, service and beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Bar staff was exceptional (don't remember his name but he's a surfer). Happy hour prices are good. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Great place! We will definitely be back. Love all the options for pizza. Dough was great! High quality ingredients. Also loved the selection of Italian wines and local beers. Service was great."}
{"text":"Good quality pizza and nice friendly fast service! Great place for a tasty lunch! Atmosphere was pleasant. Will definitely have to come back and try some of their draft beers some night."}
{"text":"Beautiful beautiful beautiful place excellent atmosphere The pizza IT'S GREAT THE FOOD IT'S AMAZING clean place me and my family fall in love with this place they did an amazing job on everything"}
{"text":"Great food for adults. This is not a kids place. Not much food for kids. Even though they serve pizza most kids don't want the items they have for the pizza. Atmosphere is nice- price is decent"}
{"text":"disappointing to say the least. our pizza war undercooked, when you pick up a slice, it folded over your hand and the dough, interesting concept, but the prices where too high for sub-par pizza, would not go back."}
{"text":"Crust was ok, they did put lots of toppings but charging per topping is crazy. My husband, son and I think fired pie is much much better!!  Associates were very nice and inside was clean."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Char! We love sitting at the bar because Lindsay takes wonderful care of us! She knows exactly what we like to order! We highly recommend heading to Char! Sit at the bar! You will thank me later!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere! I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have yard games on the patio (cornhole, checkers, etc)."}
{"text":"YUM!  I had the bacon and corn pizza and I will never order anything different when I go there.  So good!  The other pizzas that the people in my group had were also very tasty.  They only complaint we had was it's a smallish place and they had live entertainment which was very loud.  It was hard to hear.  But otherwise, a great place!"}
{"text":"They have really amazing pizza! This is one of my go to pizza joints.  The flavors are exquisite! I  Wish they had more food options.  I would give it 5 stars but lately the young staff keeps burning my crust lately."}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant! Was a big hit with our whole family and we love the patio vibe. The gluten free options were a bonus that tasted so good! Thankful for a classy and clean family restaurant so close to home :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Char since they first opened up and they have always had fantastic pizza. Unfortunately the last few times I've been here the quality has slipped a bit. I normally don't leave reviews but thought this one needed to be made as I was pretty disappointed with dinner on Sunday (more specifically the pizza). We ordered two pizza's to share, a margarita with pepperoni and a margarita with ricotta cheese. They both came out undercooked and completely lacking the \"char\" on the pizza's that we come to love & expect. The dough on the ricotta pizza was literally raw in the center and the crust was incredibly spongy and soft. The dough was a little more cooked on the pepperoni but still undercooked. After finishing a slice of the ricotta I decided to ask for the manager, which is something I never do, and he quickly came out to great us. He was very friendly and willing to hear us out but I don't think he understood the concept of this restaurant as he said the way we received our pizza's was normal and if we wanted them to be fully cooked and less doughy that we have to ask for them to be well done next time. He gladly remade the ricotta pizza and made it \"well done\" the second time but it still wasn't up to par. It was Alamo as if the oven was too cold and the pizza didn't have the high heat to bake it the way we've been accustomed to. Overall experience was good and there's no such thing as bad pizza but they have been lacking a bit with the pizza oven in my opinion lately."}
{"text":"Best pizza, reminds me of New York! Best and freshest ingredients, fast and friendly service, my husband and I eat here as often as we can. Try it, you will make it your favorite just as we have."}
{"text":"Char is an amazing family restaurant with great pizza and atmosphere. Highly recommend taking the fam."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to Char. The first time was when they had just opened and it was crazy. Really could not write review after that first time. We couldn't even sit down because there was no seating so we got it to go. It was good. So we went back on Friday night. Me and husband got off early and we enjoy going to happy hour somewhere. We went around 4pm and it was not very busy, which was nice. We ordered our pizza and then we wanted to order drinks from the bar. They had to transfer our bill to the bar in order for us to order drinks. Ok, whatever. Once we sat down the bartender came over and I ask what they had on happy hour? NO HAPPY HOUR. Not good! My girlfriend who joined us had ordered a martini, it was $11.50. Ouch! Me and my Husband shared a pitcher of beer for around $10.00. It was a small pitcher that I could have drank by myself. I would say about 32 ounces. This place will not survive charging high end prices for drinks. Especially since there are at least 5 other places around that have happy hour. Needless to say their pizzas are ok. Pricey compared to Firepie. Toppings on pizza we burnt. But still eatable. I like it, but not going back to dine in. It's to small and again no happy hour! Did I mention no happy hour."}
{"text":"Great cute little place with a bar for a quick happy hour. EVERY single employee was happy, smiling, and helpful. Great staff of local teenagers which was wonderful to see!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a lot of choices, did feel a little overwhelmed. Some prices are a little high but that's to be expected it's not a fast food place. Clean place, fun atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! 3 of us shared 2 pizzas and a Ceasar salad as our meal. Topped off with a Cannoli and a Tiramisu. I highly recommend the Dreamy Cheesy pizza! Fabulous! The pizzas have 6 slices so we each got two slices of each pizza. Super friendly staff. They were very busy but the line to order went quick. Our salad was brought out to our table immediately and shortly after our pizza arrived. We waited to order deserts until we were finished and so happy we didn't skip it because oh my gosh!!! So yummy! We ordered our drinks from the bar and the bartender was so sweet and checked in on us at our table as soon as she noticed our drinks were empty and promptly kept us filled. The management team kept things organized and there was always someone at our table to clear our plates. Support the small local businesses and give CHAR a visit!"}
{"text":"Love love love!! I have been here several times and it is much better than Fire Pie. The ingredients are always super fresh and the staff amazing. I even love that they have local brews on tap. Very relaxed, casual dining atmosphere. Favorite specialty pizza is definitely the pesto party! Must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Can not justify a frozen crust gluten pizza the size of a plate for $16.90 ridiculous! It scary to eat here.  To top it all off, pizza was burnt. Beyond chard.  I don't mind paying higher prices but quality has to meet price.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Darn good pizza. This joint here will have you stuffing your tummy until it's about to bust and splatter its Italian delight in your home, or the restaurant. But maaaaaan if you ain't had char you ain't had pizza! Pepperoni!"}
{"text":"We had the best time at char pizza our greatest bartender Lindsey introduced us to some new drinks that they have in the pizza is amazing would highly recommend this to anybody"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a place like this on the north west side. Pizzas are amazing, very authentic. Few nice local craft beers on tap as well as a nice selection of wines in tap too. They did an awesome job on the decor, place looks great. If you are in the mood for a great pizza, it's a must visit."}
{"text":"Gluten free crust is as close to \"normal\" crust as I've had: crunchy and delish. Added own toppings and it was perfectly baked. Attentive crew and fast service.  Nice atmosphere and decor. My fav pizza place in the North valley / Peoria area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Servers were friendly. The pizza came quickly and was very goos.  Would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"We originally went there for dessert but there desserts are not freshly made they were dry and tasted gross. We ordered pizza as well and it was terrible pizza the dough is terrible and the toppings didn't make it any better. The atmosphere was really nice and the service was nice but the food and desserts were not good at all."}
{"text":"Wow. Exceeded my expectations!  Was a bit hesitant about the assembly line pies after having terrible pizza at MOD, but was I pleasantly surprised! Nothing like fired pie or other chain pizzas. The crust was perfect (wood fired) and they use San Marzano tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, among other premium ingredients. You can have a pie off the menu or create your own. We had four different ones and all were delicious! Pies start at $7.99 and they are a decent size for personal pizzas.   Char has a bar, in addition to offering a few beers on tap where you pay. There is also cannoli, made fresh daily, and it is amazing. Franco, the owner, came around to check on patrons and he talked to us for a while, which was really cool. Always nice to feel your business is appreciated.   We've been here three times already and they haven't been open a month yet. Pretty sure we've also sent a dozen or so people in so far, since we can't keep a good thing a secret.   Thank you for bringing a unique, quality pizzeria to the area!"}
{"text":"best pizza on the west side!!! love that the sauce is real italian!!!! I would come here everyday if I could! Also try the brushetta! Yum! So happy you guys are across from my work! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza's great staff and management is always nice and friendly.. Clean and nice and relaxing place to eat"}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best. We ordered pizza and a salad to go and they were both disappointing. Pizza was almost dirty on the bottom (not talking about the typical \"char\" from wood fire pizza...this is something else. Salad was yummy but not enough of it to even share. Another Peoria fail."}
{"text":"We have recently moved to the area and are trying out all the restaurants in the area. Well, we have found a local gem. My husband and I shared the dreamy cheesy pizza. What a great combination of cheeses and the balsamic gave it a nice kick. We also shared a bruschetta plate with three different types. The one with the ricotta and apples was my favorite, but they were all delicious. It had a small salad in the middle. The prices were reasonable and the employees were friendly and gracious. We didn't try them on this visit, but they had a wine list, beer list as well as craft cocktails. I see a future happy hour visit. The desserts also looked very good. I think this may be one of our new go to places."}
{"text":"Having never been to a MOD pizza, this was a new concept to me and explained why I wasn't able to call in an order ahead of time to take home (would be helpful, however).   Echoing everyone else's comments, the dough is absolutely perfect. It has enough salt that it doesn't taste like cardboard and has an amazing chew that you know it isn't excessively processed flour like typical chain pizza places.   They had only been open a few days when I went, so there was a lot of confusion by employees of what went on what as well as the noise level in the place being nearly impossible to try and yell my order to the girls putting everything together. It wasn't all that pricey in my opinion. I think the three pizzas came to $38 with tax, but they were ones that were already named, so we weren't adding on items like the person with the $20 pizza. They also didn't get the memo it was a to-go order when I paid, so I had to wait a few minutes for fumbling for some boxes once my name was called, but I met what I assume was one of the owners/managers and she was very nice and you could tell she's making mental notes how to get the place to run smoother once they start to get a rhythm set.   I'll definitely be back. The pizzas are perfectly sized for one person and definitely that crust is worth going back for. Giving them a slightly higher rating because of the lack of options out here, but I'd give it a solid 3.5 anyway if it were elsewhere in the valley."}
{"text":"Vegan and gluten free options? I'm sold! They are a little skimpy on some of the toppings but overall it's good and my whole family likes it."}
{"text":"Char is as good as it gets! Every pizza there is amazing! I am a huge fan of the white pizza but have also tried several others. They even do gluten free for those who need it! Staff are polite and take the time to listen to customers. Anyone who wants an authentic Italian pizza needs to come here!"}
{"text":"Great fired pizza! We tried the sausage and peppers pizza and an antipasto salad. Next time I may order a little less red pepper but overall very tasty and fresh. The ambience is wonderful on the outdoor patio with live music on Friday night as well! We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"great place to go get a real quick custom pizza!! Quality is on point and there crust is amazing soft. I come here on the weekends usually and its a very nice chill spot that i can relax and grab an amazing pizza here! They also have espresso which is bomb after a great meal highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was super excited for this place to open! I've been twice now; the first time I enjoyed a custom pesto,  chicken, and artichoke pizza. The bruschetta, which allows up to three choices, is delicious. We also shared a Tiramisu desert which was fabulous. The second time, I was craving the bruschetta. I tried 3 different options from the first time and loved them all!  We also had a Nutella cupcake which was very good, and great for satisfying my 20 year-old daughter's sweet tooth. We'll definitely be back for a third visit!"}
{"text":"We went in hoping to have a nice sit down dinner with some great pizza, once in the door we were disappointed it was set up like a subway where you order your pizza and walk down the isle telling them things you want on your pizza if it's not one off their menu. Once down at the Bruschetta, we pick 3  thinking we were picking 3 items to be put on the pieces of bread. They are all pre-made and they show on display behind the glass. It was hard to get into that type of ordering when you are set on sitting down and having someone take your order at the table. Also to get a soda or water, it is set up like a fast food place where they hand you a plastic or paper cup and go to another area where there is a soda machine. Once we found a table to sit at our Bruschetta showed up, the bread was about 1.5\" thick and the items loosely placed on the top, it was very hard to eat and the crust was very hard, don't get me wrong, I love this type of bread but for Bruschetta it wasn't working. Once the pizza came it looked great, my husband got the Meat lovers and I got the Prosciutto and fig, his was very good and mine was good as well, my only complaint is that the center was soggy and once you picked up a slice the topping slid right off. I will order pizza from them again, but I will get it to go and bring it home, wasn't fond of the subway thing."}
{"text":"Love char! Good pizza, good service. The west valley doesn't get much \"outside of the box\" type places. Char is one of them. Prices are great as well!"}
{"text":"3 stars for poor value. 4 stars for taste. Wheres the 3.5 option???  Pretty simple really... pizza tastes good. Tastes fresh. Service was quick and friendly.  The pizza is just too expensive for what you get. Fired pie on 75th and the 101 is essentially the same thing but about $3 cheaper."}
{"text":"Finally. And by finally, I mean finally a real quality, East coast style pizza joint with the trappings of local upscale but not pretentious bar atmosphere. The dough is delicious, the ingredients fresh, made to order and real quality crust, doughy chewed crust, like real neopilitan pizza should be, and as close to NY or Boston pizza as I have had here last 15 years living in the land of crappie local pizza dives and chains. Don't miss this place, and support this local business. Bar has excellent wine selection to boot. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"We love this family owned pizza place!  Friendly staff and owner,  very clean and the pizza is true Italian style not the boring American pizza.  And be highly recommend you try the bruschetta, fresh ingredients and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Unimpressed by this overpriced place. The pizza was okay, not something I'd come back for. My two teen age sons have the same opinion. Likely will avoid this and just go to Barrows. The cost benefit I'm just not seeing."}
{"text":"I've been back several times and the service has just been excellent. I'm still not in love with the new crust/pie shapes. I can't pin point it but they just don't seem as unique as they used to be.  I'm always up and down on this place.  On one hand they are charging 12 bucks for a tiny pizza.  On the other the ingredients are decent and it tastes good.    That said the service and the fact we have a non chain place in the area is just great for all of us.   They also have live music on the weekends and an awesome patio with corn hole, fooseball, and connect four. Along with heat lamps and several tables to hang out at. The food is a 3, the service is a 5, ambiance is a 4 and value is a 2.    I would recommend a salad with no glaze (so gross) and any pizza also with no glaze.  Our favorite is a marg add pepp."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to people who love pizza and bruschetta. When you walk in to the restaurant the place is very open. When you go to order you can order certain pizzas or you can order your own creative masterpiece. They also have really good bruschetta which you can get a trio with three different kinds of your choice. They also have delicious salad and they have a great assortment of salad mixtures. When you order it is very fast to get your food. When I went it was about 60% full and I got my food which was two pizzas and a trio bruschetta in about 10-15 minutes. Char was a great place and I recommend it for many people. I would love to come back to the restaurant"}
{"text":"Okay-so my family and I are HUGE fans of Fired Pie and Char is very similar with two huge differences- First, at CHAR, the staff is neither helpful nor friendly(this was our first time and we told them this) and  the pizza is Dramatically overpriced. Two small pizzas and beers and we spent $40.00. If cost and service is no issue then choose CHAR- if you like  getting as many ingredients as you would like without being charged for each one separately- go to Fired Pie."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  It is our Friday night ritual and it is always something we look forward.  The bar staff knows us by name and even knows our order (guess we are a little predictable)!  Great food and super fun atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Such a yummy place! Happy to see this quality on the West side. Called ahead to say we were coming with a large group. The manager Yoni was super helpful. Food was delicious, decor attractive, new and clean, and the staff was friendly and quite competent. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials ($6.50  for pitcher of beer and $6.50 for a pizza) at the bar! As for the pizza, it's better than Papa Johns and Barros but still under par compared to Fabio's on Fire and La Piazza in Glendale. Pizza was dry, missing flavor."}
{"text":"Well we tried this place Friday for dinner and must say disappointed!! We eat out often and love wood fire pizzas,but this one was so so. Pricey for what we got and we don't mind paying for great pizza as! I ordered veggies which had,tomato,onions,bell pepper,mushroom and jalapeno cheese and hardly any sauce I paid $14.99 for a small pizza that was just so so, my husband was the same price as well. When we paid the cashier said $38 with some change we were surprised! I had a beer and he had a soda. I agreed as well the music too loud and the workers behind the assembly line can't hear you. I had to repeated myself what I wanted on my pizza several times cause she can't hear me.  I agreed with the gentleman regarding wood fire pizzas should have some char on the crust and both our pizzas didn't have any,my veggies were barely cooked. I think they need to cook them a little longer. We were not impressed at all and will not return! I think we will stick to our V's Taproom they have great wood fire pizzas."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots. My husband an I enjoy sitting out on the patio bar with a bottle of wine and great pizza. The games outside are a really fun touch and I love that the patio is dog friendly.   Good food, friendly and attentive staff and fun environment."}
{"text":"Just had this for lunch and it was excellent. I ordered the margareta with spicy sausage and chopped garlic. The size is a little bit small but is a good portion for lunch. I ordered on a Tuesday in which all of their classic pizzas are just $6.50, plus extra topping charge."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's FAR better than any of the other \"make your own pizza\" places that have popped up all over town. This is more authentic Italian pizza with quality ingredients and recipes. It's family owned and operated by an Italian family and you can really tell the difference!"}
{"text":"This place made my pizza really burnt and gross, I don't really recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Had the garlic lobster pizza it was delicious. The cross was the bomb I could sit here and eat that all day.  Gotta try It!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly staff and the food is amazing!  Great to have a nice place close to home to go dine in.  Their pizzas are amazing!  We have been here a lot if times and never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Char Pizza, an incredible experience ! Great Pizza, and unbelievable crafted cocktails, no lie !!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great service. Pizza is best in the area by far! Worth checking out for sure. And it's fast. Best pizza choice in north Peoria area by far"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised! My kids each loved their pizzas, BBQ chicken was really good, and the staff was super friendly. I can see it becoming a regular for us:)"}
{"text":"FINALLY something cool in Peoria! Great to have a trendy little place to frequent. Pizza, wine, and beer on tap. Life is good."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Fresh dough and ingredients. We also had the bruschetta as an appetizer delish! Fast friendly service, great atmosphere. The pizza was great, just how I like it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good tasting crust. However, charging extra for each topping is a little ridiculous. Especially since all of their competitors don't. We went three different times but finally decided we were done. If you're a 1 or 2 topping type of person it would be worth it but I'm a supreme kind of guy that likes as many toppings that I can get to stay on the thing. It would cost me a small  fortune here but only $8 or so at say Mod or fired pie or 1000 degrees etc. Maybe that explains the lines and can't find a table at the other places for lunch and it's cricket song at Char. Just saying..."}
{"text":"I seriously would not even give this place 1 star but the inside was nicely done. So 1st off we have never been there. So i asked the young man at the front how does it work we have never been her. He just looked at us and looked at us. So i said ok what sauces do you have? He tells us these sauces. I looked at him and said of course  but what are they? We put are toppings on and go to check out and they say that will be 33.00 dollars. For 2 pizzas? Well toppings are a 1.00 each mam. 11.00 for toppings? If i would of know that i wouldn't of gotten 11 toppings. Im used to fired pie. So we got there at 3:30 and got our pizza at 4:00. So i ask the guy for a box because now we have to go. At this point I am hungry  and irritated. So i open the box and grab a slice of pizza. Zero flavor you cant even taste the Alfredo sauce, and the grease so much. Worst pizza place ever i would rather eat 2 day old pizza from Little Caesar's Pizza. I have only wrote a review on a place one other time in my life. I was so upset by all of this I actually downloaded the dam yelp app to write this review. Fired Pie 4 Life."}
{"text":"This is becoming my new spot to meet up with my friend on Wednesday's. They have a great deal, bottle of wine and bruschetta for 20 dollars. Plus if you make it there for happy hour you can score some extra savings. Happy Hour is only at the bar, as well as their Wednesday Wine and Bruschetta deal. Happy Hour from 3-6pm and again from 8 to close. Kids eat fee on Monday's. And a few other great specials they run. This is one of those build your own personal pizza places. Thin crust cooked for 150 seconds at 800 degrees in a wood-burning stone oven. So its cheap and fast, but also fresh."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for dinner with my 10yr old (he now swears this is his favorite pizza place!). The food is great, the staff are very attentive, as soon as I walked in one, Logan, introduced himself and explained how to order from the line and that was also open seating by the bar. They have games for the kiddos on the patio  have craft beers and wine on tap for the grown ups. Food, atmosphere, staff are amazing!"}
{"text":"It's like Fired Pie only upscale! It's a very laid back environment but the food is definitely taken up a notch. We enjoyed assorted bruschetta, 3 different pizzas and a salad and loved everything. Great beer/wine/cocktail selection too!  It was definitely an unbutton the top button of your jeans kind of night. So worth it though. The service was excellent and the restaurant was spotless.   It's perfect for a date night or a night with family.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was our first time. Was recommended by our Airbnb hostess. It did not disappoint. Very good pizza. One of the best things is they don't scrimp on toppings and you can get some unique gourmet pizzas with the options they have."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of this restaurant. It was the first time I had been, and it's a little intimidating at first because you don't quite know where to start. But the staff is great and walks you through each step of the way. It's very similar to a chipotle for pizza. You choose your toppings or you can choose one of their specialty pizzas and they also have salad and bruschetta and dessert. They have beer and wine as well. And the quality of the pizza was good they took it while you wait it doesn't take very long and there are lots of different combinations I got a goat cheese and prosciutto pizza very tasty."}
{"text":"CHAR has delicious fired pies, bruschetta & cocktails! I mean, what's not to love with that combo?! I love the concept of choosing my own toppings à la Chipotle & the mix/match bruschetta deal. Their service is always great, I love that they always change gloves & are extra careful for gluten & dairy free orders. Their happy hour is pretty awesome, $6 pizzas, $6 cocktails & wine! I love the patio setting, makes it such a nice place to bring the family."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for Char to open so I can try it and I'm glad the wait is over. Had the meat lover pizza and enjoyed every bite. It came with pepperoni, salami, sausage, and capicola. The crust was delicious and authentic. Tried the Pinot on tap - yum. Also had the variety bruschetta plate and that was a nice appetizer. There is a great atmosphere here and everyone is very friendly. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We love going here and the place is very nice and clean.  Really good pizza and cool you get to pick out what stuff you want on your pizza.  Nice indoor/outdoor bar and really good food."}
{"text":"Cute modern Italian style pizzeria in Peoria. Walk in and pick your pizza and toppings and get to the end of the line and decide if you'd like some dessert. Whether you're interested in dining in or taking out this place is great. They have a great bar area that extends to have part of the seating outside. They have so many great choices whether you're there with family or friends."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place all the time, never stopped and regret it. This place is delicious! Fresh ingredients, so many ways to customize your pizza, and the crust is just perfect. The staff was so friendly and I was surprised how fast the pizza came out after we ordered it. Most places are a 20+ minute wait, but it was less than 5 minutes to get our food. My only complaint was the garlic I requested. The chunks were about pebble sized, which is too big for a pizza. I ended up picking it off. Definitely coming back to try the bruschetta and another custom made pizza!"}
{"text":"No Happy Hour...wth!  Drinks way over priced ($11.99 for a small martini) and beer by print is $5+.   Pizza is good, but very little toppings. Pizza is way  over priced for personnel pizza.  Also, the crust is not crip by any means.  The placed is named Char...right?  Its far from that.  Bottom of pizza is soft and toppings are burnt.  Staff is friendly and they do give military discount on food.  I might be back, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was very excited about this new place! I love the way the inside is decorated, its very clean and nice. The menu is a little confusing. Maybe its because i frequent Fired Pie and i thought it was the same deal. The pizza and salad were both very tasty, but i felt the prices were a little high. Especially with a Fired Pie going in down the road i feel like Char needs to stop charging per topping so you can get exactly what you want without breaking the bank. The pizza was good though so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Once you eat at Char, you will never be able to get pizza anywhere else again. I am a huge fan of NY pizza... and my wife and I have had many genuine Neapolitan pizzas in Italy. None as delicious as Char.   It is worth every penny. When I remember to breathe instead of inhaling every piece of deliciousness, I often have leftovers too.  We know the owners personally, as they have been in the business for decades and in the west valley for nearly 10 years (they built and ran the very-successful Lakeside Bar and Grill across the street). The family puts their heart and soul into every piece of cheese and topping served here."}
{"text":"How does this not have 5 stars??? I'm a fan of Fired Pie, Mod, etc. but Char has something a little more special: the ingredients are farm fresh and deli quality and there is a Bar! Great ambiance, comfortable seating and family friendly. I and several others that I watched come in were a bit confused when first entering, but once you place your order the super helpful staff will guide you to deliciousness. Unlike the other fired pizza places, Char's has more of a restaurant feel and not fast food. They offer brushetta and salads that all look amazing."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! I ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! Ridiculous. No one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. I started off with a $7.99 pizza! How in the world did those little toppings add $12.00! Workers are all incompetent. I was shocked when I received my total. I told the cashier that ALL the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. The cashier's response was uhhhhh I just moved here from out of state. He looked like a deer in the headlights. I told him I'm never coming back. No offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me.  To be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. Go to MOD or Pieology instead."}
{"text":"Well done Char! 'Well done' not only describes the way I like my Pizza, but it describes the process your Staff took me through to help craft my perfect Pizza.   So...'Well Done!'  They haven't missed any details in this Pizzeria. From the flavorful sauces and high quality fresh ingredients of the Pizza, to the unique concept of added Bruschetta and Insalata stations where you're a part of making your own meal.  And what Italian meal would be complete without a piece of Tiramisu and fresh 'per cup' brewed Italian Coffee? Well, they did it...and it was all excellent!   Thank You for a great experience."}
{"text":"Decided to try Char out one day when running errands. The decor is modern, and they have a full bar which is rare for a counter place.  However, their pizza leaves a lot to be desired. When we got our pizza the crust was underdone and still \"doughy\", and the center of the pizza was basically \"soup\".  I didn't time it, but I am pretty sure it wasn't cooked long enough, and you generally should have some burned spots on the crust edges. I have never had such a runny pizza in my life.  We actually left two pieced on the tray that we didn't finish. Possibly the worst Neapolitan style pizza I've ever had, and definitely near the bottom of the list either way. :-("}
{"text":"It was an excellent experience all around.  It was our first time there, and we had our new dog with us (dog friendly patio, yay).  The staff was super helpful and friendly, brought us a water bowl, and helped us deal with the challenge of one person staying with him and the other ordering for both people.  If you haven't eaten at this style of pizza joint, it's kind of like ordering at Subway.  You walk down a line of ingredients and ask for what you want and how much of it.  Or you can order one of their pre-designed pizzas and customize it as you go along.  Then they fast-fire it in a wood oven which is amazingly done in about ten minutes.  Everything was top quality, and very tasty.  The people building the pizzas were very friendly and patient with questions.  They have a few beers on tap.  The room is huge and wide open, as is the patio.  They have a few games on the patio."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and will keep coming! Great food with an amazing atmosphere! Definitely try the pesto party pizza and the bruschetta with pesto and salami!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time but we will be back.  Food was great service fast, and Josh our bartender was excellent."}
{"text":"This is a casual interactive Neapolitan Style Pizzeria. The dining room is modern and comfortable. It looks like they have a full bar too. Char offers a menu with suggested salads and pizzas or you have the option to build your own sort of \"Subway Sandwich Style.\" The pizzas are made with 00 flour and are baked in 800 degree wood fired ovens. You seat yourself grab a number and they run your food to the table.  Ordering is somewhat difficult. You order in the middle of the pizza line and a bunch of teenagers try to take your order. I asked for the complimentary Calabrian Chiles to be added to my pizza and the teenagers look at me like Im a leper or something. Then someone from the other end runs a small container of oil with some chili to the teens. After you order the pizza you proceed threw the line to the cashier and you get a number, your drink and seat yourself.  I tried the Bianca pizza. The crust was thin and crisp with raw flour underneath and a very wide crust ends for it's size. One slice from my pizza was all crust and topping free. My pizza was suppose to have some ricotta cheese on it but I couldn't identify any on it because whatever cheese I had on my pizza was baked on so hard it was like a cheese crisp. The cheese wasn't melty and was baked on hard like a crouton.  This place uses better ingredients than other similar concept restaurants I've been too but comparing this Neapolitan style pizza to others Neapolitan pizzas I tried the two stars is accurate."}
{"text":"Ever since the restaurant has opened my wife and I have eaten here and had great experiences. We also go here a lot because of the vegetarian cheese and gluten-free crust. My wife has been dairy free for almost a year and it's hard to find a restaurant that offers these special dietary options.   Not only do the nice people of Char offer great ingredients, but their service is stupendous! For having mostly young employees on their staff, their service is really great. When they bring out the food they ask to make sure it looks good. Personally I like my pizza extra extra crispy. So when they bring it out and it's not crispy to my liking they will accommodate without any hesitation or attitude. The only thing I ask for is a wider variety of beer selection; draft or bottled.   This restaurant is definitely a family night or date night spot. We've been going here ever since it's opened and will be a long time patron.   I recommend getting the Sausage & Peppers specialty pizza with fresh mozzarella, ricotta cheese, and jalapeños!"}
{"text":"I give this a five star on the pizza alone. The pizza is awesome.  The atmosphere reminds me of Pei Wei.  They do have a small bar where you can order your pizza , and tables are at a first come cafeteria type basis. Love the fresh ingredient and the fire baked crust. For some reason the tvs seem to only show hockey games????"}
{"text":"Very friendly, kind, clean and delicious pizza joint. Everything is made to order. For others complaining about the pizza...you literally have it made in front of you, if you don't like something speak up, they will gladly assist! Only flaw is the croutons for the salad, wish they were homemade!"}
{"text":"First time ordering, I was pretty excited since restaurants are sparse out here in Peoria. I looked at their menu online and decided to give them a call to order take out when I was out and about doing some errands. I planned on trying a few salads with the pizza's I ordered, but was rudely told by the girl on the phone that they only took paper coupons ('printed only'). In the days of digital coupons, they should put this disclaimer on their site so one is not confused that they can take advantage of the coupon without printing- or maybe save a tree and go digital. Ordered a few chewy pizzas and one salad that was drenched in dressing even though I asked for it on the side. The pizzas were bland, tough, and the toppings were sparse. The fig pizza was way too sweet and the figs were cut too large.  The servers seemed uninterested and bored. Even my pizza loving kids were underwhelmed, and my daughter said hers gave her a stomachache.  I think my $42.00 would have been better spent next door at Papa Johns, at least their pizza has some flavor."}
{"text":"This pizza place is new so I'm hopeful it will get better as the staff are trained. This is a build your own person pan pizza place with a wood-fired stove. Very similar to Fired Pie.   They charge per topping so be careful not to order too much as the base price is already higher than I've paid at similar pizza shops.   We waited for about ten minutes for our food (which isn't terrible) but since we were sitting on the patio, the staff couldn't find us and gave up until we found our food sitting at the counter inside.   Love the concept of build your own pizza, but with the young untrained staff and high prices, I'm going to stick with Fired Pie for now."}
{"text":"We visited on opening day, and we have been back many times since. The ambience is nice for couples or families. Only the highest quality food products are used. We love all of the bruschetta selections, and the pizza is delicious.  Love their crust. We have taken family to Char's, and they were equally impressed. Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience. My parents have been raving about this place for a while so I decided to try it. My boyfriend absolutely loved his meat lovers pizza, he had bacon, sausage, pepperoni and ham (i think) on there. I sampled a few peices of the sausage and it had a very clean, savory flavor, not like the greasy clumps of junk other places put on pizza. I had a salad since I have a slight gluten sensitivity. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was for selling Udi's Gluten Free pizza dough. I'm not sure if anyone who works there has ever actually tried the product, but I have a few times and the taste is horrible. I was hoping they'd offer something else, maybe eventually they will. The salad I had was good, I enjoyed the lemon oil dressing which was light and refreshing. I think they should allow as many vegetables as you want in the salad for no charge, but the counter girl told me 3 only. Maybe I was hoping for too much, but I was disappointed by that. The decor was nice, modern and clean. Bathrooms were also clean and in good repair which is a great thing since most places seem to overlook the importance of a clean bathroom for theit guests. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every visit gets better as it opened 5 weeks ago. The pizza is crisp, fresh and just the right amount of everything. Service is better and better and they have a large selection craft beers and creative cocktails. I will be back many, many times!"}
{"text":"The highlights of this pizzeria for me are the bruschetta and their cocktails. I love the laid back atmosphere, and that there are varying ways to enjoy your pizzas. Now that the weather is beautiful, it'd be a sin not to enjoy the patio, which has outdoor games if you want to play too. Indoors, there are booths, a family size wood table, smaller marble tables and high bar tables. The bar is really nice and the bartenders are dedicated to making great cocktails and you could tell that they try to get to know their regular customers. I enjoyed both the Tessarosa cocktail, which had Four Roses Bourbon and amaretto among other fun ingredients as well as the peach bellini, which was light and refreshing.   The pizza is really good! I don't like it more than Cibo or even Humble Pie, but it's still really good. Not to mention, the pizza comes out pretty fast! Their fancy oven churns out pizza with pizazz and I haven't had a burnt one yet with even how hot it is!   I always order the prosciutto and fig pizza. It's my go to. I would love it even more with truffle oil but their vinegarette works since it's sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Going to Char was a pleasant experience.  It was recommended to me by Smith B. It's a clean, and fairly large establishment, with plenty of seating and a built in bar.    I really like the seating options here.  You can sit at the bar if you want that 'drink' experience.  There are high tables and booths if you are with your family.  Dining 'al fresco' is also an option...if you are on that special date...   Food service is similar to pieology, or similar 'make your own pizza'  restaurants.  You walk up, choose your type of pie, and add your toppings.  I went a little crazy with my toppings, but my pizza tasted good.  It had mild sausage, meatballs, a lotta ricotta, fresh mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, and garlic.  We also shared bruschetta as an appetizer.  They use crispy toast as the base and add fun and interesting toppings.  The best part is everyone can get the their favorite because they let you 'mix and match'.  I don't remember which ones we ordered, but they were all tasty.  The service here was mostly friendly.  The manager came by to check on us and the cashier was very nice. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome 1st time experience. Sat at the bar with my wife.  Alex, the bartender, waited on us. Very nice man who made us feel welcome and comfortable. We ordered the bruschetta and Pesto Party Pizza.   Amazing!!!! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza,salad,and bruschetta this side of the Valley. We took out 3 pizzas,salad,and three different bruschetta. Loved everything! So,so good.    Went there to eat with family last night. Food was wonderful! I love this place,and how it is perfect for families,or a special date night. Everyone that works there is pleasant,and so very helpful. This has now become my favorite place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this new pizza restaurant close to our home. First, when you walk into the restaurant it is very nice.  I liked very much how you go about ordering your pizza etc. The girl had a difficult time hearing me due to the noise level.  This is certainly not her fault at all.  My husband had his pizza delivered 15 minutes before mine.  The pizza finally arrived for me. It wasn't what I was expecting.  There was hardly any cheese on it. It did not look like fire brick oven pizza.  The salad was nice, except for the salty lemon olive oil dressing dredged in it."}
{"text":"Ordered the gluten free pesto party pizza. It was so delicious I ate the whole pizza save for one slice I gave to a co-worker. They lose a star because I felt nickel and dimed for everything. I ordered my pizza carry out and got charged for one ranch and hot peppers, and I almost got charged for a water cup because I wanted one with a lid but the guy behind the register was nice enough to just give it to me.  So after the gluten free crust (which I expect to pay extra for) and the little condiments, and tip I spent $18 on a personal pizza. A little on the pricey side for lunch."}
{"text":"This pizza was delicious.  Fresh ingredients.  Fast and friendly service!  Great full service bar!"}
{"text":"We heard rave reviews for this place while we were vacationing in the area. Wow!   I have not had a red sauce this good since I was in Italy. I also used to think that Mike's Pastry it Modern Pastry set the bar for cannolis in the United States. Well boy am I wrong. CHAR's cannolis now sit atop my list. I highly recommend checking this place out. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Definetly coming back here. I ordered the bacon and corn pizza sounds like a weird combo, but it was amazing. Will recommend other people come here."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!  The whole family really enjoys this pizza ... your prices though aren't as good as Fired Pie."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salad special. Try the cannolis made in house to order. Definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time there today! priced a little high. The Bianca with black olives and the Pesto were delicious! The Margherita needed something.We loved the oven fire taste!! We will return for more!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place.  Wood fired pizza that is served many different ways.  I went with the classic cheese and pepperoni and it was delicious.  I will definitely be back to try some other options.  I like the fact that the pizza is ready in about 3 minutes.  Makes it easy to get on a quick lunch break!"}
{"text":"Pros:  interior is amazing.  Clean, minimalist bar as well as seating.  Very clean.  Employees polite.  Pizza was good and could feed two adults.  Cons:  This may be my mistake.....I ordered the Marinara pizza. No cheese.  :(  Re-read the line above, pizza sans cheese.  I now realize that the menu says no cheese - nver had a pizza w/o cheese.  Toppings are $1.00 each - Now this may not seem like much.  However, an entire onion will set you back $0.69 at Whole Foods.  At Char, 1/16 of a lb. will set you back a buck.  Same for mushroom.  I am fine with a business making money, but $11 for a personal pizza is a bit too much money for the business.  Would I go back?  Only if it was free or someone else pays.  Oh, and tell the employees not to eat food while working the assembly line.  Yes you had gloves on, but that piece of chicken you just put into your mouth was delivered by your gloved hand.  Honestly..."}
{"text":"Not sure I get the 4 star rating and giving them 3 is generous. We had a margarita pizza and a sausage/red pepper pizza. Crust was ok but not very crispy and would expect more char and chew for a Neapolitan style pizza. Sauce was bland so all in all, very average. We started with bruschetta which was also average and lacked real flavor and the bread was far too hard. Reasonably priced for happy hour but with average food for our taste, we would not return. Cute place with a nice patio and the staff was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"The pizza has a nice chew and flavor. They were not generous with the toppings, one slice of our meat ball pizza didn't have any meat balls. The salami on the pesto pizza was barely visible. The Caesar salad was tasty. The service is very slow and the training of these new employees is not working quite yet. Here is hoping they make a few adjustments as they have potential. Good luck!"}
{"text":"My family and I recently moved to this area and decided that we wanted to check out this place. We didn't really know much about it so I checked out some reviews on Yelp and we headed out. We went on a Saturday around lunch time and it was not busy at all. As soon as you come in the are there to ask you what pizza you would like to have. They have a pretty good selection of pizza types or you can create your own.   The pizza overall was pretty good. I would say that it is pretty similar to other wood fired places that I have been like fired pie or pieology etc. My wife got a sausage pizza, my mom a pepperoni, my kids a cheese and I branched out and got the barbecue chicken pizza. They were all pretty good. The only reason why these guys get 3 stars from me instead of 4 is that they charge you $1 per topping or cheese type of you add it to a \"pre made\" selection. I was shocked when I found that out. That is a pretty steep prize for a little extra cheese. I can go to a place like Fired Pie and get every single topping they have for the same price. Other than that the place was worth going to."}
{"text":"Ambiance is really cool. Full bar but no Patron? Ordering is fsirly simple. Pizza was fantastic. Love the concept."}
{"text":"Great food, the Pizza is by far the best ever. They have Great happy hour specials on drinks & pizzas. If your looking for a run of the mill pizza, this is not for you. This is a superior hand rolled pizza with the true tase of casual Italian dining. I always have the Pesto pizza & my other half prefers the Margarita Pizza. They are all good. We do miss the old manager who went to another location."}
{"text":"It's become our go to for our girls night out. Love the six different varieties of bruschetta - can't decide which is my favorite. The flights of wine are so much fun and the prices are great. The bartenders are cute with lots of personality making it so much fun."}
{"text":"The very first thing the owner/ General manager needs to do is  train the toddlers who work the place customer service or hire some people with skills. The food had potential but the service ruins the experience. They run on auto pilot and are not really paying attention to service."}
{"text":"Great family or date night spot.  Love how fast the food is and quality of the food is better than you would expect from a faster dining experience.  Been several times and always had a great experience.  Love their patio too!"}
{"text":"Tried this since close to home...very nice inside and the pizza was good and service ok."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is absolutely amazing so fresh and so delicious. There are so many options to choose from it's almost overwhelming. The bar has delicious drinks and the beer is super cold. They have the best happy hour in town!!   $6 mini pitchers, $6 glasses of wine $6 craft and classic cocktails $6 classic CHAR pizzas"}
{"text":"The have pizza down pat. Love it if you order the meat pizza stand by for some seriously good sausage and pepperoni  We hit this place once a week"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place. They are very fast at getting you your food and they have tons of choices. Best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Another pizza joint that is overpriced for what you get. Comparable to Fired pie but not as tasteful of a product. Long waits at times and horrible parking in a tiny strip mall."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic and the place looks great! Great as a neighborhood place to be!   Their food is really good and authentic!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat and have a few drinks.   The pizza is to die for.  Crust is amazing.   (Was even good warmed up as a leftover)  Bruschetta was excellent.   They have some amazing looking deserts.  Too bad we were too full to try them.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very similar to fired pie or sauce but bigger with a bar and a nice patio.  Had the bruschetta and cheese pizza. The staff in the front was not focused on me, they were focused on talking to each other. My mom ordered her cheese pizza, I was standing near the bruschetta not being helped, my mom said excuse me two times to try and get their attention towards me and was ignored by the workers. Instead, one worker was getting the other worker's order that they wanted for lunch. At that point I simply said in a loud voice to one of them, can I order my bruschetta. A not friendly guy helped. (I think he was the manager or the one leading the rest of the staff, Asain male.)  Anyway, I only know that because the really nice guy at the register (red head- don't know how name either) was having a hard time because the prior employees separated my mom's order from mine and I wanted to pay together and he wasn't able to combine the checks and asked that other guy for help. At that point, I just told him I would pay together because it wasn't that big deal to me and really, I didn't want the arrogant guy that took my bruschetta order to get annoyed to help me again because I would have needed to say something and I was trying to just have a nice, quick late lunch. (This was about 410p today)  The really nice guy at the register later ended up clearing our table and is actually the only reason I'm giving this place stars because the food wasn't even that great. My aunt was with us and had a salad, antipasto, it barley had any meat on it. The patio is nice. This place is average and some of the staff needs some customer service training."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was delicious! The pizzas are made to order, and they have a nice outdoor area to enjoy on those days and evenings when it's nice out. It's a little noisy from the road traffic but still pleasant. I was there for lunch, but it seemed like a fun place to hang out in the evenings as well, as they had yard games on the patio. They also have great specials like a bottle of wine and board of bruschetta for $20. The pizza that I had was delicious, fresh, and perfectly cooked. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Place is a little pricey for the size of pizza. But quality makes its worth coming back"}
{"text":"The best salads and very good pizza! It is hip and stylish and clean and the food is fresh and prepared well. Also, friendly and accommodating staff!"}
{"text":"I like to write balanced reviews, however CHAR makes it very hard to find a negative. Since I say that I will mention the only two that come to mind.  1: They could offer a larger pie option. 2: Horrible parking lot at their strip center. That said.  My wife and I are making this our only one/go to pizza place.  The San Marsano sauce and fresh ingredients remind us of the Napoli style pizza we grew up on.  Yaay for the owners of Char.  You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks, attentive and friendly service, extremely clean, and the atmosphere is fun and relaxing. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! Great out door space for kids to play and the family to enjoy their evening! They even have life music on weekends!"}
{"text":"First visit to our new neighborhood pizza joint. Menu is confusing and gal asking what I wanted was pretty rude.  I let her know I've never been there before etc. Pizza dough was literally raw in the middle. Cashier gave me back change from $40 cash and just smashed it back in my hand with receipt on top saying \"here's that\"...what the heck? Didn't count change back at all or even say $16.45 is your change back, have a great eve. Very rude young staff."}
{"text":"Screw char, fired pie is where it's at. I wish I could give zero stars. Disgusting food, horrible service and rude employees. Very upset never coming back"}
{"text":"Char Pizza is extremely well run and managed. The decor is upbeat and the service que is very efficient. We had prosciutto and fig pizza with arugula and balsamic dinner was very tasty. However, next time we will ask for extra char since the crust wasn't very crispy. Overall a very good dining experience..one of the few gems in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place on a whim last night. And I'm glad we did! We loved it! We sat at the bar, had a couple drinks, and some delicious pizza! I love the vibe and decor, very nice but laid back. The bartender rocked, too! I had the blood orange margarita and my husband had the lumberjack Hefeweizen. We were both impressed by the drinks and service. My husband got the meat lover pizza and I got the pesto party pizza. Service and food was awesome! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The dreamy cheesy is not something I would ever  typically order but someone else I was with did and oh my, it's divine. Best quality ricotta cheese and it not too cheesy. It's a definite must try. I am happy this place is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner, nice little modern vibe. They've got an open bar as well. My boyfriend and I looked at the family eating near the front and saw the sizes of the pizza...we decided we would each get our own pie. We didn't customize our own but rather ordered off the specialty pizzas. I got the capricciosa and the boy got the pesto party. In addition we got a board of bruschetta. So we ordered our pizza from the first station and then if you want bruschetta you go down to the next station. Then once you've ordered you head to the register where you can order drinks and whatever else. A bit on the pricy side and we only got waters. But it was a nice experience and the food was delicious. Might be nice to come back and enjoy a drink and a board with some friends. Love that it's not too far from home"}
{"text":"Char has the greatest pizza with the freshest ingredients! I love the atmosphere and the outdoor area with games that make the dining experience fun for all. I would absolutely recommend Char to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Manager Lindsey and owner Franco make a top notch team! The pizza and atmosphere is amazing!  Just the right char on the crust! I'm so glad to have a great pizza place I don't have to drive to Phoenix to eat! Make sure you try it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was OK, but expensive for size and ingredients. Noise was horrific and seating limited. And the process of waiting for and being called for your pizza did not work well. Total confusion. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Yes, on the pricier side than most pizza places, but the pizza was well worth it. The crust was amazing from their fire wood oven, and the service was impressive for how new it is. Definitely will be going here again :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great environment!!! Definitely the type of place our area needs more of!"}
{"text":"Went out of our way a little bit to try this newer spot off Lake Pleasant Parkway.  We were a little confused by the layout when we first walked in, and had to follow the instructional signs placed throughout the restaurant to understand the \"flow\". I'm guessing the signs were an afterthought as others were most likely just as confused as we were.  Hang with me here while I explain as the ordering process is a little odd. When you proceed to order, give your order to the first person you see who will start your order, then you recite your order again to the person at the ticket generating iPad, then let the people at the register know what you ordered to confirm against your ticket. Yes, we went through this exact bit of craziness that was the strangest ordering setup I've experienced in a while. I'm sure if we came back, we now have a better idea how this place operates and should be a slightly smoother process, aside from the order repetition to multiple folks.   The bar is setup in an opposite corner from the food. Half the time there wasn't anyone there, and the other half the bartender working was eating a pizza at the bar in plain view of the customers. VERY unprofessional in my opinion and no reason why this should be happening.   Complaints about the confusion in the dining room and bar aside, the food was good. The pizza used quality ingredients, and the salads were freshly tossed. The BBQ chicken pizza was actually really good, while the Margherita was a little bland without much basil. Caesar dressing tasted more like ranch than anything, but still good since I also like ranch.   If we come back, it will be that we are in the area and craving the BBQ chicken pizza since we unfortunately won't be making a special trip out here otherwise anytime soon."}
{"text":"When the patio opens I change it to 5! The Crust is Amazing! Pizza choices for days! Gonna try them all! Had Hot Pepperoni, Broccolini, Jalapeno. Desi was Great! The bruschetta looks amazing but only had room for pizza. The Nutella Calzone looks pretty tasty as well. Will Be back for sure. (Patio is open!)"}
{"text":"This Lake Pleasant area is pretty void of local restaurants beyond a few cookie cutter sports bars. It's primarily just chains that cater to the extremely dull suburban scene, so I consider Char to be a welcoming addition.    Contrary to the traditional sit-down approach I originally assumed they'd have, Char has adopted the ultra-trendy Chipotle-style approach to their pizza, which is a model that people seem to lovingly embrace (ask Fired Pie). In some ways, I understand the benefits from a business standpoint. People like customizing their food and generally dislike restrictions on their favorite ingredients. What I don't like about it, however, is that the atmosphere is usually frantic. Long lines, lots of noise, minimal seating, and high-pressure to keep moving/choosing. Instead of being a restaurant, it becomes more like a cafeteria. I feel absolutely no guilt in writing a big zero in the tip line for this reason alone.  The one thing I give Char credit for is the fact that when they first opened up, they recognized some hiccups in their ordering system and adapted things accordingly, making the operation run much more smoothly.    We always start with the bruschetta. Well, I shouldn't use the word \"start.\" Traditionally, bruschetta serves as a starter that precedes the pizza. But since they're giving you all of your food at once, you're forced to wolf everything down simultaneously to avoid anything getting cold. Although the bruschetta appears to be pre-made anyway, so it's always cold regardless. The apple, mascarpone, and fig spread is probably the best of their samplings, although they recently screwed us by completely forgetting to the mascarpone almost entirely.  As for their pizzas, their margherita is probably their safest choice, with their priscuitto and fig also being a decent option. My girlfriend and I strongly dislike their bacon and corn pie, which tastes more similar to what you'd find at the Papa John's next door in terms of the ingredients. I've seen some chefs do incredible things with both corn and bacon on pizzas, but this definitely isn't one of them. Furthermore, seeing BBQ chicken on a menu that's supposedly \"Napoletana\" just flat-out makes me cringe. Their farmers market, unfortunately, has way too many toppings to the point where it's a total hodge-podge of ingredients. I would not order it again. However, from what I can tell, most people here don't order the specialty pies as they are originally presented, but prefer just building their own - which often does more harm than good.   As a whole, their pizza is okay when it's done properly. What hurts them, however, is their consistency. We've been here several times and there seems to be a lot of inconsistency in getting the crust properly charred. A few of our pizzas seemed like they were underdone, while others were actually quite impressive.   Honestly, if you're the type to confine yourself to this little suburban area for your adventure, you'll probably be very impressed. But if you're spoiled by some of the more critically acclaimed wood-fired pizza joints in Phoenix, you'll probably find these pies to be weak.  In summary, I see it as a good little neighborhood place that will most likely become a favorite of people who live in the area. It's reasonably priced, it's convenient, and it's locally owned.  But don't expect it to compete with some of the heavier hitters down south. And as much as I want to give them a higher review, based on their inconsistencies, I just can't."}
{"text":"Such amazing pizza, bruschetta and local beer choices. The cannolis were AMAZING. Would recommend for anyone to try!! Josh our server was so personable and attentive and the owner even came in and checked in on us!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Appears to be a restaurant run by children. Stood in line FOREVER!  Bacon corn pizza sounded intriguing and has potention. With a name like Char and Naples mentioned, I expected a browned crisp crust and cheese. My pizza was a soggy oily undercooked mess from the cream sauce,cheese and EVOO. Grownups should be on hand until a quality process is in place. Back to Barros."}
{"text":"Bruschetta and salads are the best things on the menu.  Don't love their pizza or that it's an order and take your seat kind of place.  I have been twice and both times the bartenders were NOT happy to be at work.  Haven't taken the hubs or kids yet so will give it another try at some point."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour and the service at the bar was great. The food came out quick. The pizza dough had the perfect chewy texture."}
{"text":"Was excited to finally try this place ! Was disappointed with how quiet the workers were while you tried to order , it's likes she was whispering and the big glass wall didn't help much either . Wasn't helpful that the ladies behind the glass were being rude and looking at me as if I was doing something wrong ...... made me not wanna even stay , let alone pay. I felt has if the ladies def werent talking loud enough . The pizza wasn't so flavorful but hat could have been cuz I already had such a nasty experience with works that it just didn't help and the salad was like she threw a whole can of sliced olives on it . All out for my first experiences with char , not good ."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in town by a milestone on all fronts.  The atmosphere is that of gazing at a unicorn. The music is super good where I have seen and heard people jamming out not only to the LIVE music and the radio. The place is always super clean and spotless and you are going to leave with a smile no matter what mood you enter with. The workers are so entertaining to watch and entrant with. They always have such fun story's to tell about their day while still working hard in the process of telling.  The manager I just met to day has such a sincere aura about her, such a caring and warm smile that sticks with you. She really compelled me to wright this review because after talking with her I just forgot were I was, I felt like I was fine dinning at a 5 star restront with an exclusive guest list. Needless to say they earned far beyond 5 stars, not just for one good experience but for rocking my socks harder and harder each time I visit. People I have met here ONCE have remembered my and my name, what a wonderful place to eat for less than 20$ a person!"}
{"text":"I first thought that a new pizza place was not a good idea for this area since there are already 5 pizza places at that intersection but now that it is here I am very happy about it.  The food is great, my favorite so far is the pepperoni & sausage special with peppers.  They also have some pretty cool bruschetta options as well.  The atmosphere is upscale casual and the concept is just like chipotle for pizza.  You can make your pizza custom and they cook it pretty quickly for you and bring it to your table.  There is a bottleneck sometimes when it gets busy and the cost can be pricey when coming with a large family but the overall experience was awesome and we have been back twice already since my first visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to try this place. However tone was automatically set with unfriendly service. Went to use the coupon from online specials and cashier said it needed to be printed - although nothing stated on coupon."}
{"text":"Our pizza was charred (no pun intended). Aside from the burned crust, the flavors were good. We also had great salads. For what we got, it seems a little overpriced."}
{"text":"This is a cute restaurant a lot like fired pie which I do enjoy more. You can build your pizza and salad they bake it in a very hot oven. The whole process is very quick, and it has a lot of appeal for people that are getting a quick lunch. They do have a Tuesday special where they have six dollar pizzas. It's all day Tuesday so that's nice. So if you catch their specials it's a good deal."}
{"text":"While the food is decent, the service isn't great. I ordered wine with my meal and with several follow on orders, and each time the food came out first. Considering the food had to be cooked and/or prepped, whereas drinks solely need to be poured, that's poor service. I also came at 1pm on a Saturday and only 5 tables were occupied; meaning, completely not busy.  And while I can appreciate good customer service for patrons, the bartender was completely talking to another table for almost our entire visit. It wasn't till that table left that the bartender was suddenly attentive.  Another member of my party ordered coffee and that came even later than the wine. We had to go back to the register to remind them about the coffee. Additionally, she asked for a black coffee and the server stated, \"it sounds like you'd like a latte.\" For those who are not coffee connoisseurs, lattes come with milk. Not very knowledgeable regarding coffee.  One of our last orders was the bruschetta with mascarpone, apple, and fig. While one of the three bruschetta pieces had nice, thin sliced apples, the last two looked like someone gave up because the slices were overwhelming large chunks.  If service is something that's important to you, you might want to skip this place. Ambience is ok and so is the food, so if you don't mind waiting or reminding the servers of your order, then go for it. As for me, unless someone else is buying, I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. We will definitely be going there a lot. The bruschetta and pizza are fabulous. The service was attentive."}
{"text":"VPN. Anyone who knows real pizza from Naples Italy knows what this means. This is authentic pizza. Most of the ingredients are from Italy and must be cooked in an oven that was shipped over from Italy. There is no way to write a review of how good the pizza is. You must experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"Holy price increase. Was reasonable when they opened but now the price went up and each item cost an extra buck. Even the cheese. Ridiculious.    I will drive the exrra disrance for Fired Pie which is better anyway."}
{"text":"This place was meh. The idea is cool..assembly line pizza.  And the choices of toppings were plentiful. And even the pizza tasted ok..i like the wood-fired oven niche. BUT..it was WAY undercooked. My pizza arrived supper soggy..except for the very outer 2 inches, all the way around. Also, my friend attempted to get a drink from the bar, like someone had done a min. before him. And the girl back there had her back to the room, with her nose in her phone...for a good 5 minutes. My friend stood there for 5 mins...and she just was going to town on her phone. Not coming back.  Not impressed AT ALL."}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent pizza ,fresh chunks of mozzarella cheese, meatballs . Salads are very good ! A +++++  we will be back soon."}
{"text":"My hubby and I enjoyed having lunch at Char during our trip to AZ. Upon entering the restaurant it kind of reminded me of the set up at Chipotle. The staff offered a friendly hello and welcome when we came in. That was nice. You pick your pizza type from the menu and you get to see the fresh toppings being placed on your pie. The staff really do make the pizza exactly the way you want. The ordering process was pretty quick and the pizzas came out within 10 minutes.  The pizza is really good... great tasting sauce, good crust, and I liked how fresh the ingredients were. Be sure to note that extra toppings are a dollar each so it can get a bit pricey. There's also a full bar inside and TVs. Char seems like a nice place to have pizza and drinks with friends or share a meal with the family. I will visit this restaurant again when I return to AZ."}
{"text":"Did a takeout. The orders that were correct were tasty. But 2 of 7 orders were wrong despite accurate \"read-back\". Meat Lover was more ample and tastier than orig appeared--quite good. But pricey as they charge per topping plus 71% accuracy (5/7) and you get deduction of 2 points which equals score of 2.5."}
{"text":"Great pizza, salads, and bruschetta. A little more on the fast food side from a service perspective, but the food doesn't reflect that. Kind of odd set up where you stand in a queue to buy your food then you have to go to a bar to get a drink. Can't complain with the level of the food they're serving though."}
{"text":"Expect this place to be busy.  After you eat a Char pie, you'll understand why.  Can't get enough of this stuff.  I feel kinda bad about that because there are some really solid pizza shops around town.  I just can't stop eating this stuff.  Everything looks like the owner is really picky- like OCD picky, and that's a very good thing in the food business.  Most places look for the cheapest crap they can buy and toss together to feed you- um yeah, no.  I love that they do my pies exactly how I want them as I watch.  Nice little bar inside to \"hydrate\" while you wait a few minutes for your food to hit your table.  Man, I mean this stuff is tasty on levels you really don't realize!  It's just...just go.  Go now."}
{"text":"First timer here....agree with several of the other comments about not really knowing the drill. Yes there were about 10-12 teenagers staring at me like I should know exactly what do? (I was the only one in line )  I got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza to go and I ordered it well done, that seem to solve any of the undercooked issues others were having. When they brought it to my table they opened the box for me to see and  I sent it back to be cooked more. It ended up pretty perfect and tasted fresh. I also ordered a ceasar salad, which sucked. Lettuce didn't seem to fresh and way, way, way to much dressing, croutons seemed like the cheapest kind you buy at the store. Couldn't even eat the salad and won't order that again. But will be back for the pizza and this time I will know the drill. Oh and the checkout cashier with all the hickeys on her neck was a special touch!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Farmer's Market pizza - no meat; Friday. We shared the limoncello mascarpone cake - amazing - and I had a cappuccino. Delish!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim because we had a gift card for here and a gift card for Chili's, but Chili's had a 30+ minute wait! We aren't pizza eaters with my boyfriend being dairy free, but we decided to try it. Came in and I was extremely confused about ordering and paying, so I deducted a star. A girl greeted us and took our order and we proceeded to another girl at a register in the middle of the make line, she confirmed our order, got us a salad then sent us to another girl at a register to pay. This part threw me off so much! We waited less than 10 minutes for two pizzas and a salad and took them to go! Man, was I delighted when I got to try my pizza. It was cooked perfectly! The BBQ sauce was not too spicy and perfectly sweet. I was definitely impressed! The house salad was a tad bitter and I was hoping for sweet. Bummer! But, overall I will be back! Great pizza! :)"}
{"text":"Exceptional! I'll make a special trip out of my way just for the amazing food! The staff is awesome, it's fast and easy to order and the prep line is clean, Love you guys keep doing what your doing!"}
{"text":"My first visit.  In a nutshell:  1) The bruschetta was very good.  $9 2) The pizza was good, however it was small.  $11 3) Wine on tap was cold the way I like white wine.  $7 4) I counted 12 young people working \"the line\".  The customer service is lacking.  Me: Where do I order?  Them:  Here, and then they never looked up or made eye contact.  Hello?  Hire a manager and place that person right up front.  Not everyone knows \"the drill\". 5) At the cashier.  Me: Where do I order wine?  Them: Here.  Me: OK, do you bring it to my table or what? 6) After 5:00 p.m. turn the lights down.  Bright lights everywhere, even at the bar.  I felt like I was dining at Taco Bell.  Not enjoyable at all. 7) Pizza delivered to table.  Me: Where are the napkins and silverware?  If you have ever been to Fired Pie in Phoenix you'll know the difference.  I hope this place makes it as we so need more choices out in the West Valley.  I might be back for take-out.  Dining in experience not so good.  Good luck Char."}
{"text":"Great place. Love seeing a hip, cool restaurant with live entertainment, outdoor seating with games in the west valley. I hope to see more like this soon. Great place to hangout and get a drink and grab some pizza"}
{"text":"Super modern and delicious pizzeria. Had dinner with my mom here and we loved it enough to come back again.   You walk in and order the pizza and see the assembly of it all and the pizza oven all before getting to the register to pay.   There is a bar in the corner and a big patio outdoor area with tons of seating and backyard type games.   Pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"Normally quick and friendly service but for some reason today was horrible.  Only one slow turtle girl decorating the pizzas while 4 other employees pretended to be busy, and it was not busy.  I think they were boycotting her due to her lack of drive - not sure.  We walked out.  Upset wanted a good pizza."}
{"text":"Cute joint with a fooseball table and cornholl outside for the kids which is nice. They upcharge for just about everything though  ($1 to add onions to a salad, the same price to add chicken?? not sure how that makes sense..) so it's not cheap. We will probably only return for happy hour prices. The gluten free pizza is nice for celiacs. Wouldn't rec. the house salad unless you love chunks of fig in it. The bruchetta was good but the bread was pretty tough."}
{"text":"I love this place...the food is great, the atmosphere is awesome.  Its super laid back, and fun!"}
{"text":"I ate here about 2 wks ago with my daughter. She's eaten here a few times & loved it. I had a White pizza with spinach. By the time I got back to our table with the drinks, the pizza came. So fast. It was delicious! The crust was crispy & light. It was enough to share but we each got our own. I took home half but by the time I got home, I wanted to finish it because it was so good!! I would definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is way to expensive for what they serve! I will never eat there again!  The pizza was only just ok, and nothing to brag about! Ordered a salad also and it came out hot not cold!!! Looks like there trying to be federal pizza and postinos all in one! Fail!!"}
{"text":"I like Chars.  I've been there a half dozen times as it's closeby and consistently good.  It does get crowded and the bar is very small.  For a build your own pizza place they are superior to the chains such as Pieology and Fired Pie.  The  only negative is Chars charges per topping which can easily get pretty pricey for for a personal pizza.   Especially considering that the topping portion size isn't very much.  If they'd adjust that they'd get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good pizza and they have a bar. Staff is ALL high school students, not that there is anything wrong with HS students but when all they do is chat and slack off... We have been there more than once and the owner just walks around oblivious to what is going on with her staff. The place could be so much better if it was managed well - hopefully Char picks it up because I love pizza!"}
{"text":"This higher quality pizza place is great for an area full of chain restaurants.  It is similar to MOD or 1000 Degrees. The pizzas are delicious, but a bit small for the price. I always take mine to go since the dining room is small and canget noisy and hectic.  But overall, this is the best custom individual pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Well I attempted to write a note to the owner / manager via the \"contact us\" on their website in an effort to tell them of my issues privately but since there's no contact method other than phone, I will let everyone hear about my experience.   Normally very good but last night was a major fail. Order#55480 We arrived just after 8pm. There was no one in line and no one waiting for pizza to come out of the oven. There were a couple tables occupied by patrons who appeared to be done eating.  The girl taking the orders and making the pizzas was very nice. We placed our orders, 2 pizzas, one meat lovers and one bacon and corn. The pizzas were made quickly and we moved down to the register to pay and wait for our take-out pizzas. The girl at the register was also very nice and personable.   So now we sit and wait...then wait some more. As we wait I notice that the oven seems \"dark\". Then we realize the pizzas have been in the over for quite some time. We see two boxes sitting on the counter so, since we are the only ones who have ordered since we arrived, we assume these pizzas are ours. We walk up and the man with the beard tells us that one is ready but the other pizza needs \"a few more minutes\". OK, no problem. We sit back down and wait. I look over and NOW the oven is all lit up with fire like it normally is. Red flag!  Finally a kid brings the pizzas over to us. I ask him, with a smile on my face, \"I thought these pizzas are supposed to cook in 150 seconds? We've been waiting for over 10 minutes\". He laughs and says, and I quote, \"If you want to yell at somebody, you can yell at that guy right over there\" as he half-points over his shoulder at the large teenager with his gut hanging out of the bottom of his t-shirt. My reply: \"You think I'm yelling at you?\" He says nothing, I pick up our pizzas and walk out. The time is now 8:30pm  Now, before I continue, this is NOT about the wait! It's about the difference between a pizza that is cooked (Char'ed) in 150 seconds vs. a pizza that is \"baked\" for 10-15 minutes. YOU KNOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!   So, I paid over $20 for two small pizzas that were burnt on the bottom and barely cooked on top. Then I get attitude from your immature teenaged employee.   It's obvious you were prepping to close and had either turned the oven off or down. This suspicion was reinforced by the fact that dunlop t-shirt man-boy was sweeping up the floor right next to where our pizzas were sitting before they were placed in the oven.   Overall, I think we will keep our distance from Char for a while. It's very irritating to pay top dollar for a mediocre product served by apathetic teenagers.   Get it together Char. We love your pizzas (usually)"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! They have great service, great pizza, and I love the atmosphere. Their beer selection is good and I love the build your own pizza menu :)"}
{"text":"Love coming here and making my own personalized pizza! The ingredients are on point, I love their tomato sauce, and the specialty pizzas are amazing! Especially their pesto and fig & prosciutto  their bruschetta is my favorite, the topping selection great and a trio of those are a meal themselves. I've had their specialty cocktails like the lake pleasant and it was different and good!"}
{"text":"The very best pizza in town. Thin crust, chicken pesto, garlic, evoo. So delicious. Service great. Ashley at the bar area was friendly, knowledgeable and quick. Great friendly and casual atmosphere with above average pizza and bruschetta. Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this for dinner tonight and it was just ok, there were good and bad things.  First off I know it is new, just opened Sunday, and it's Tuesday however, the staff did not seem to know what they were doing. There were so many employees on the line and only a few were actually doing things.  My husband ordered the bacon corn pizza.  As the employee was making it she was continuously looking at the menu behind her to see what was on the pizza and even still she for got the bacon, my husband reminded her kindly. As for me, I got a make it yourself, simple, marinara, shredded Mozzarella, mushroom, pep, and pineapple. I had to repeat myself 5 times, she was talking to her coworker.  Then we moved down the line to the salads. It was our first time so we wanted to split a salad, so we got their house salad, it's a spring mix with a Balsamic dressing, the employee began making it with hearts of Romain, so my husband again kindly said I think it's with a spring mix.  The employee said oh ok, and remade it. Then moved to the Bruchetta, I was very excited for this, until I realized that they were pre-made and sitting on the counter for who knows how long for us to choose, not made fresh:( finally we got to the cashier, he asked our name, and he had another name down but we reviewed the order and the original employee that started our ticket must have mixed up the names no big deal until the cashier began to argue with my husband that we did not get bruchetta, even though we had.  My husband explained the types of bruchetta we got and the cashier continued to argue with him.  Finally after paying for our full meal it was a bit pricey but we found a table and began with the salad, that was supposed to have a Balsamic dressing, well it didn't it was lemon, the kind they use in another salad, so that was disappointing. The the Bruchetta we got three different kinds and only liked one the apple, marscapone and fig spread... AMAZING!  The other two, a salami pesto and marscapone, fig was ok nothing special. Finally got to our pizzas and they were great cooked perfectly, fresh ingredients.  Overall experience wasn't awesome but we'll try it again in a few months, once they have it together more."}
{"text":"You've GOT to try the Bacon & Corn pizza...it's so yummy. We've tried five or so different pizzas and all have been excellent. The crust is amazing. Service was great in the restaurant and take-out was awesome, too. We won't go anywhere else for pizza on our side of town anymore...this is it!!!"}
{"text":"This really is the best pizza place in Peoria, Glendale and Northwest Phoenix. I don't know what the hell they are up to as far as how they make it so good. Honestly I never get tired of this place. My family eats here at least once a week. This is the only place no one groans when the decision is made to go here which says a lot about how good it is. We really enjoy hanging out on the patio when the weather is accommodating. Friday nights they have a musician with an acoustic guitar and he is very good. My kids love the giant connect four game as well as the foosball table. We have been going here since it opened as this side of town is starved for good restaurants. We will continue to head here as long as they let us in."}
{"text":"Yummm. I loaded my pizza up for $12, less than a meal at other places. So good too. Interior is nice, patio is nice, people are nice. Just a great place.   Can't believe I waited so long to try it. I think it's much better than Humble Pie."}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely amazing here, so many fresh ingredients and options to choose from I can literally get a new style of pizza every day.  The decor is beautiful,  you can hang out for hours and feel comfortable doing so.  The staff is super friendly and very helpful.   They also have a beautiful inside/outside bar with a delicious drink menu, local brews on draft and yes even wine on tap, which I love. Great prices for the high quality food that your getting.   I will definitely be back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"My family loves having Char in our neighborhood... great food, friendly staff, and fun atmosphere!  We often order for take-out as well!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day and it was a very weird and unwelcoming experience. Coming in the guy in front rolling pizza dough didn't say anything to us and another girl came to help - or so we thought. Everyone was very pushy and not very helpful and we were the only ones in line. It seemed like no one wanted to be there or help or anything. While paying many of the other employees were up at the front and an older male employee was just poking the side of a younger girl employee and it was just very uncomfortable and unprofessional to watch. We got our pizzas and bruschetta and it was pretty good. I think it would've been better if the atmosphere had not been so strange. While eating, employees were behind the counter drinking drinks over the food, sitting on the counter, crouching down and texting. It was just disappointing at the service and despite the pizza being pretty good, I don't think i could make myself go back there and experience that feeling again."}
{"text":"Over priced for the quality and customer service was not the best. Go to Giardino's for a much better experience!"}
{"text":"Service is swift at this eatery. The prices are reasonable and the food decent. I liked the assorted bruschettas more than anything else. You barely have the time to sit at your table and the food you ordered is ready.  The concept here is unique...you stand in line as if you were at Chipotle or Subway and choose your ingredients. While the pizza and its ingredients were tasty, the crust was not as thin as I expected hence I wonder if it's true Napolitan pizza as I've had before and that truly had very thin crust.  The pizza is big enough that you can easily share one with someone else for lunch or dinner. I did not see any desserts on the menu and would have liked to try them if they had some.  I did notice that they had an espresso machine but did not try an espresso or cappuccino. Overall, nice concept and I wish Char Pizza much success. I though the employees were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! What an excellent place for top notch pizza and salads. All healthy and freshly made right in front of my eyes. Also this the CLEANEST place I have ever eaten at. In my opinion any review other that 5 stars is ridiculous. I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars with potential for more!  Hmmm....what to eat?  Pizza?  Sure, sounds good.    I was browsing Yelp and came across this pizza spot.  I take the 303 to work every day, and I noticed that this spot is right off the 303, about 2 miles down Happy Valley.  I decided to jump in my car and take a drive.  It's only about 20 minutes from my house, so the trip down here was pretty quick.    I had looked at their menu online before I arrived.  It sounded like a cross between a \"build your own pizza\" (Fired Pie, MOD, Pieology etc) place as far as the pricing and ordering, and a nicer Neapolitan style (Pomo, La Piazza Al Forno etc) place as far as the type of pizza they make.  Your basic Margherita pie starts out at $7.99 and then goes up from there depending on what toppings you add.  I had my mind made up that I was going with a pizza with meatballs, onion and garlic.  Each topping is $1.00 (garlic is free), so my pizza, and a Coke came out to $13.00.  Not too bad.  A little more $$ than the \"make your own pizza places\", but less $$ than the \"good\" Neapolitan style places around town.   About the ordering process......... Right when you walk in, there is a guy with the dough, forming pizzas.  He asks you what you want, and then you kind of move down the line.  The only problem with that is this........The menu board is behind the long counter.  They have specialty pies and bruscheta/salad options etc.  You don't see the menu though until you are half way down the line.  If you didn't know what you wanted, it would be a little hectic trying to walk down, browse the menu, then come back to tell the guy what you want.  It got a little more odd because after you tell the guy what you want, you then get asked by a lady at a register? what you ordered.  I guess she types that in so that when you get down to the cashier, the order is there in front of them?  I didn't get the purpose of her having to key in my order, then have to go somewhere else to pay for my order.  Maybe when they are super busy, it comes in handy?  There were only like 10 people in the place when I was there, and nobody else in line.  Anyways....when you get done with that, you pay the cashier, they hand you a number to stick on your table and then bring the pizza out to you when its ready.  On to the pizza...............  My Meatball, Onion and Garlic Pizza-  When this pizza came out, it looked pretty good.  It had plenty of meatballs and a nice amount of onions.  The cheese was a fresh mozzarella and it was a bit sparse, but that's how most Neapolitan style pizzas are, so it was alright by me.  I took a bite in and the flavors were very good!  The dough and crust were pretty soft and had only a little bit of char on it.  I prefer more char and other places around town have it down to perfection.  The crust was a bit more doughy/chewy than I prefer on a Neapolitan style pizza.  Still, not bad.  Overall, it was a decent/pretty good pizza.  I ate all 6 slices and left feeling full.   I'm pretty sure I will be back again to try out a plain Margherita.  You could get that and a Coke for right around $10.00.   Not bad, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza place ! The pizza is so good!!! Me and my girlfriend love coming here at least one a week! Highly recommended!(:"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I revisited the place today because I thought I'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.  Their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  While the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  Great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but NOT burnt.  Theirs is soggy.  I first went in during the evening.  This time I went in at lunch time.  There was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. I told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  She indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.    IMHO, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  It's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  This is where they are falling down.  Hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.  ===================================================================== It is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  It is very nice inside.  The seating is comfortable and well decorated.   However, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  When I first walked in I sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  I dismissed that and I ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  Pretty standard.  Their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  It was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  I took it back and asked for a re-do.  The second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   The toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.    I think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  They have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  They have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop."}
{"text":"Okay, so the pizza here is good enough to give 5, (hell I'd give 6!!) stars even though they don't have the fastest service & LITERALLY up charge, even when your substituting out a meat for NOTHING. Last time we said \"no sausage\" & they charged $1. It's only $1, and it's SO EF-N good so who cares right??!?!! Oh, & good it is... dayyyemmm it's so \"east coast rare\" & delicious. It's totally worth it. Waited 35 minutes today for a carry out order (was told 15-20minutes). Was charged extra to sub out a meat & all we said was, \"instead of sausage, could you just put on the cheese\"... It's totally okay though because the pizza is THAT DAMN GOOD!! SO, if they run late, or overcharge, just deal... because it's IMPOSSIBLE to find such an east coast, NYC, (I'm talking about Lambardies on Spring St.) style pizza in AZ."}
{"text":"We ordered two flat bread pizzas from this place.: the barbecue chicken and the prosciutto and dig. The oven fired concept did not disappoint on these two pizzas. The barbecue sauce was not overboard and has the right balance with the chicken and onions. The prosciutto/fig was a unique experience. The saltiness of the ham with the sweetness of the figs were a welcome change for a pie. Previous reviews suggested a long wait. My pies to go were no more than a 10 minute wait. I ordered two dude salads as well. The flavor was good but the portions were a little lacking. They could have added more Greens. This place is a great alternative to the plethora of pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Char Pizzeria.  Great atmosphere and decor.   It's a build your own pizza place.  We had all four types of Bruschetta's to start and they were all good.  The pizza is a thin crust brick oven pizza.  We had the prosciutto and fig as well as the sausage and peppers pizza which were both delicious.  Staff was pleasant - especially Alex from South Philly!  This is a place I'd go back to.  Worth our 40 minute drive."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to try Char! It was last Friday night at 6:20, and all the tables were taken. I was surprised that there was no seating arrangement/priority. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple drinks while we waited for friends to arrive. I observed newly arriving customers eyeing the different tables, just like we were, to see who might leave next. So, when it's busy, and if you're not a little aggressive and watchful, you won't get a table for a while. I could see the ordering process, whereby you walk along the ingredients section and order your custom or specialty one-sized pizza, bruschetta, etc. We watched from the bar for about 20 minutes and were then able to get a table.   We really enjoyed the taste of our pizzas. One complaint is in the way it's served: on a plate, which allows moisture to collect under the pizza, making the center 1/4 of the pizza crust soggy. This may be due to the close timing of the delivery of our bruschetta, and then our pizza. The pizza sat for a few minutes while we finished our bruschetta.  The staff was terrific!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food, the family, and the over all atmosphere.  When I think of Arizona, I don't think of Pizza, but now that I've moved back up to the PNW, I can think of nothing but pizza at Chars and finding something like that up here now.  It is sooo tasty!!!  Completely melts in your mouth.  It's the type of pizza you'd think of in Napa Valley - wood fired, light and did I say delicious?!  :)  The staff really took our boy under their wings and took him on pizza tours when they weren't busy.  It is run by a really sweet Italian Family we'll never forget.  Speaking of don't forget - don't forget to have one of their homemade cannolis.  I'm not a huge cannoli girl, but man, you'll probably die and go to heaven...  incredible.  Family atmosphere and lots of games to keep your kiddos occupied.  They have a funky setup - similar to a Red Devil where you can order pizza first and go sit down, but if you go sit in the bar area, it's full service..  Hope you enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. No complaints but some of their staff came off rude when ordering what we wanted on our pizza.. As if it was insulting to them and we were ruining the pizza. Kind of made it uncomfortable but what can you do. I loved the design of the place and the small bar but will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been fighting with my family to come try this place for months, but it's hard to tell my family we are having pizza and it not be from Barros.    So I finally talked them into it.  We went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy.  It's not really clear on the whole order and get food process.  But it's not that big of a deal , you order in line, than they bring it out to you. But You have to get the silverware and plates and bring them to your table.   The pizza is a little on the expensive side, but it was good.  The next morning my kids work up and asked if we could go back again for dinner. So we will be back."}
{"text":"CHAR just came through on exactly what the are trying to do - quick, quality, tasty pizza. A little more expensive than a pizza from a national chain, but faster, and cheaper than your typical gourmet restaurant.   I think the unexpected highlight for me was the dough, which I have probably only said about 1 other pizza place.  I prefer a thinner crust, but not cracker crisp - a pop and then chewy - thin, but firm enough to hold up the slice.  Nailed it, with fresh-baked dough, and a great dough/topping ratio.  We got a white pizza and a meat pizza - different flavor profiles, both delicious, with great toppings and balance of ingredients. Probably closest in size to a typical medium, but a little smaller - we had 2 slices leftover each, a younger me would have finished off the whole thing easily. CHAR will be visited again!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, I was very disappointed in the service I received at this business. I walked in, and the employee did not acknowledge me as he was working on some pizza dough. I came dressed in my work uniform, as I was coming here for my lunch break, that is only 30 minutes (needless to say, I didn't make it back on time). It took incredibly long for someone to even acknowledge me and tell me they would be with me in a moment. Finally, after probably 10 minutes they took my order and I payed. Then it took another 15 minutes to wait for my pizza, that happened to be sitting on the counter getting cold! I even asked for it to go. Finally they put it in a box and I went on my way. Terrible service!! Food was good though."}
{"text":"Best wood fired pizza in Arizona hands down. My family loves going to Char because it's reasonably priced, it's convenient, clean, locally owned and everything on the menu is yummy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here when we are in the mood for wood fired pizza. This place is typically busy but worth the wait. We have yet to have a pizza that we do not like but the bacon and corn might be our favorite. It sounds different for pizza toppings but you can't ever go wrong with bacon. The bruschetta is also very good."}
{"text":"We love Char. Pizza is good, caprese salad is excellent and service is great. The only complaint I would have is they need to brush their stone a little more especially during busy times. I would wait an extra minute for a clean underneath of my pizza."}
