{"text":"Used Ritual to do a pickup. The bag was waiting for me ready and on time. I ordered the cuban sandwich and fries. The cuban was quite good."}
{"text":"I was running an errand to a place next door and it happened to be lunch time. Coincidence? Maybe...  Craft Kitchen is set up like a cafeteria, with a good selection of breakfast items, sandwiches, wraps, and salads. They also have daily hot lunch specials.  On this day, I chose the Thai Chicken Curry special, served with rice. Although I wouldn't call it an authentic Thai curry dish, it did have a nice flavour. I got the last of wjhat was in the pan so I suspect it was a little more than normal. Bonus!  Their other food looked nice and fresh. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"It's located right across the street from my office. I have grabbed my breakfast and lunch many times from here not because it's delicious but because it's so convenient. They have nice breakfast and lunch menu. They have daily specials for lunch.  For breakfast I have tried their breakfast sandwiches, bagels with cream cheese, fruit cups and oatmeal. Out of everything I liked fruit cups the most ;) They always have fresh cut fruits. If you are tooooooo lazy to cut your own fruits like me you can grab it from them. Though I think that they should give more fruit for the price they charge. Their breakfast sandwiches are okay, not that great. Bagels are also just fine, I would advise them to use better bagels.  For lunch I have tried their Baked Crusted Salmon, Fish & Chips, Chicken Avocado sandwich with salad, chicken soup. My favourite is Salmon. I also like their chicken avocado sandwich but not a fan though."}
{"text":"I've gotten my lunch from Craft Kitchen for the past 2 days because it's been so delicious. The grilled veggie sandwich is amazing and the soups are well-flavoured. The other week I also tried the Maple Pecan Strawberry salad and I was so surprised at how well the Boursin complemented the other ingredients. The food is fresh and I really feel like I'm getting a nutritious meal."}
{"text":"This place is sort of like how fusaros used to be with several hot plate items that change daily - they have salad and sandwiches which tend to be on the gourmet side.    Today's menu had a beef meet pie, breaded chicken breast and fresh vegetables and a few other items - all of which were tasty and worthy of the $7 or $8 cost.   Alcohol is also served with fine beer and wine options :) two doors down from spadina and Adelaide."}
{"text":"Good little spot. Weird decor but the food and smoothies are good. Probably best to get drip coffee and not an Americano. The avocado egg white breakfast croissant was great!"}
