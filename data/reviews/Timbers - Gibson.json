{"text":"We come here as a family most sundays for breakfast. Super amazing. I love the pancakes. I wish I could have them every day. Love it here! Great service."}
{"text":"Came in with my wife, needed a breath of fresh air. We love the bartenders keven and nikki....they really know how to bring a smile to the crowd."}
{"text":"I guess I had to give it something to rate it. Before I even walked thru the door the bartender deemed I was to drunk to serve. Not sure whether they were just being lazy or being presuming that I was drunk based upon it being 11:30. Sucks for this place because I would regularly drink and play here after work but because they assumed I was drunk based upon who knows what and wouldn't serve me I will never be back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar...really good wings and awesome staff. It's Timbers...what more can I say? Try the one near you!"}
{"text":"We got coupons in the mail and decided to try this Neighborhood bar out.  Lucky for us we did.  The place was clean and the location was in a safe area.  We had the chicken strips and the artichoke dip, both were out of this world.  The staff was very friendly and attentive without being pestering.  Pitchers of beer were very cold.  
If this place had a Trivia Machine, like many bars do,  it would have our business every weekend.  Regardless we have been back a few more times and will again eventually."}
{"text":"I stopped into this place on a Monday night with a co-worker during one of my business trips.  I found it to be a mixed bag, for me.

Keep in mind that I am not a sports bar person, so this review can be a little skewed.

The +'s:

The food portions were generous, and the items were generally tasty. Pricing is reasonable, and service was good.

The -'s:

The place is not well lit (maybe a just my impression as lighting has a very real effect on TV viewing) and since it is a gaming/over 21 establishment, it was a little too smoky for my liking (something I should have known in advance-so my bad). They do not accept American Express, so it did not work well for me or my business partner in that regard.

Overall, tasty food, attentive, friendly service.  Just not \"my cup of tea\" as they say."}
{"text":"Come here with the boys, machines rock... service is awesome keven the bartender is awesome.... our fav spot"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here. I will say that the breakfast was awesome. Tasted great and was super cheap. However, the service was completely unacceptable. The bar had maybe 3 other people in it, yet the bartender completely ignored us. After we had all been done with our meals and drinks for at least 30 minutes, We finally were able to get her attention, and when she finally came over she made a rude remark about the fact that we had flagged her down. We had planned on ordering another round but decided to collect our tab because her attitude bothered us so much. Why do you work at a bar if you have no interest in serving your guests? I will never return to this location because I was so disappointed by this experience."}
{"text":"My wife and i used to come here almost every Sunday. I will never go back because of the service of a waitress. Doesn't know how to serve or treat customers. Waited 40 minutes for a cold burger.  filled my sprite with water because she was so busy trying to argue with my wife about old food that was in a fork that she served us and rudely says I don't clean the dishes hunny. She had something smart to say after asking for simple condiments. I have never wrote on yelp before but this service was ridiculous."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant side of the business. Brought the family here because we had heard good things about the place. When you walk in you're immediately hit with cigarette smoke. It was like standing near a huge ash tray it just was nasty. Because the bar is separated from the restaurant they're are no waitress in the restaurant side. We had to wait more than 5 minutes for someone to show up. We almost left but finally a waitress showed up and  seated us. I ordered the steak dinner and I'll just say I wish I would've ordered something else. The steak tasted like it was cooked on the street out back. Really tough and just tasted rank. I asked for medium and got super well done. My wife ordered the same thing and asked for medium also and hers was more done than mine! I can't comment on the rest of the food because we don't plan on going back. I have heard the bar portion is a lot better but I don't know personally. Just for the smell alone is enough for me not to go back."}
{"text":"Dont laugh but my friends from school and I used to love coming here to study!  I know we've gotten some weird looks from patrons as we stroll right in, whipping out our laptops and books and ordering beer!  We find the female servers here very nice, giving us order suggestions that are student-budget friendly! Chicken wings, nachos with artichoke (spinach?) dips go well with a pitcher of beer and make for a very productive study session.  Who knew? Lol.  Now that we're done with school, we might plan a get together here soon.  But to students from ______  who are thinking of checking this place out (you know who you are!), don't hesitate! Try Timbers!"}
{"text":"This location is very close to home, so we popped in to grab a bite, recollecting that they had some decent sliders. 

We placed our order with the bartender at the bar. We got both the Angus and BBQ chicken sliders, accompanied by some sweet potato fries and onion rings. The burgers were great, I loved that the buns were soft. The chicken sliders had a tangy BBQ sauce on it, very yummy. 

While we ate, my boyfriends played some Keno. I wish they had one of those Mega Touch game centers at the bar, I probably would've stayed much longer. Since we're not much drinkers...

The bartender was nice and timely. Not much business during our visit. I'd say our lunch there was pretty standard."}
{"text":"Was looking for something local to do on a Saturday night. .. After driving by 3 bars already we tried here expecting a little excitement! !!! We walked in around 10 pm and the place was so dead. Maybe 5 people at bar.... they only have 1 pool table to good luck waiting for the people on it to get off. 

We stayed for one drink and got out of there. 

Took a look at the menu. Will be honest we didn't eat anything but from what I could see everything was WAY over priced!  Almost $6 for 2...yes 2 sliders!  

At least we have the place a shot. Looks like a old mountain cabin lodge... hence the name timbers. . I'm good though. .. no need to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while I wait for my car to get windows tinted.  Baby bear breakfast big enough for 2. Staff super friendly & Megan (bartender) was great. Will come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We didn't eat here but just came for drinks and to watch the olympics. For both this place was fine. It wasn't over crowded, there were TV's all over, and the drinks were decent. There were even couches if we wanted to get more comfortable than sitting at the bar. To hang out this place is fine but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here. It's definitely a local spot."}
{"text":"Friendly nice people that work here .. Food is good service is quick see a lot of locals hanging out here and local workers... Eat enjoy have fun.."}
{"text":"So far no bad news!! They have a really cool seating area! You may not want to ever leave! 
I've had the chicken fried steak and eggs for breakfast, no complaints, good portion. The French toast was yummy. 
The husband likes that they have Coors on draft. Cold too!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and i love the bacon cheese burgers , BBB,    Big Beautiful Burgers a gift for your taste buds .Go to timbers and taste for yourself."}
{"text":"Timber's was the final stop last night to conclude some birthday debauchery for one of my best friends.  Phil, the bartender, was fantastic in letting us play endless rounds of pool, and drink Jameson shots to our hearts' desire.

Timber's wasn't very busy, however, the pool table/restaurant side of the bar looked like a hurricane had hit it.  Beer bottles, pint glasses, papers all over the place.  I'm not sure if Phil was shorthanded but this place was a mess before we got there.  Regardless, we all had a good time and accomplished our mission of b-day fun for my buddy."}
{"text":"I can see why this place has only 13 patrons on a Sat night. Our bartender, Nicole, tried to be nice but she had some douche bag regulars who were into her, that kept her from giving good customer service. We'll never go back again. My advice to Nicole is to be friendly to your regulars but not at the expense of other customers."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a local late night spot for dinner on a weekend and we found it!  We walked in and were seated instantly.  Seats were comfy and lots of flat screens to stare at during our dinner/drink service.  Waitress was very attentive and quickly took our orders.  I ordered some sliders with onion rings that I split with my best friend.  Food was very good for the price.  Also, checked in on yelp and used deal. Based on the food, our experience, and reasonable cost I would visit again as well as recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I was glad to see another $10 off Timbers coupon in the mail today, but then I looked closer and it is now $10 off a $30 tab and not $25 like it once was. What do I have to do to get the bill over $30? drink more beer or order something extra that we don't want to eat? No good, please change my Timbers back to where it was. We havn't had a Baby Bear breakfast in a long time, the place isn't the same."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live walking distance so when we decide not to get hungry until well after midnight - it's almost always a no-go for eating out anywhere until we remember the amazing place that is Timbers.

Decent prices for surprisingly decent food. My absolute favourite is their Killer Grilled Cheese, and for you New Years resolutioners I would try to avoid this one, if you can..

But if you like blended cheeses on toasted bread with bacon and tomato, you'll be in calorie heaven like I am whenever we order out this midnight delicacy. My boyfriend likes their burgers, and they always have it done even if we come by to pick it up a little early than 15 minutes. 

Friendly staff, nice atmosphere without too much noise even in peak hours probably because of the location. And yeah they get super busy at breakfast, but when they shuffled our egg plate orders around for all the other tables' steaks and stuff, breakfast was on the house that day to comp. can't go wrong with this place for me! A bar that's almost a restaurant. Almost :D"}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood bar.  They have these large over stuffed chairs around tables in the bar area.  They make you want to curl up and hang out a while.  The mixed drinks are no joke and could only have one before I moved to my beer stand by.  My friend agreed and she moved to a calmer recommended drink after the first.  The spinach dip was surprisingly good.  Our waitress was nice, came around often enough that we were not looking for her, but not too often to bug us.  I would return."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect.. I'm by myself, just came in from out of town, been driving all night, setting up a booth In vegas and Dropping off a trailer near by, needed food and a drink.. Perfect atmosphere to sit in a dimly lit bar, have a cheesesteak, and have John serve up some drinks w/ a smile.. Just what I needed."}
{"text":"....Artichoke dip and wings are delicious!!! If you check in you get $10.00 off your tab of $30.00 or more.....awesome!!!
  The only down side is they allow smoking. They have nonsmoking section however, your still inhaling second hand smoke :(  The next time I will order take out."}
{"text":"this is the 1st time I'd been to this Timbers and we had a coupon for $10 off of $25 (that INCLUDED DRINKS!!) This is a smart move by this place b/c without it we would never have gone. We spent way over $25 b/c the drinks were almost $5 anyway! This is definitely not a cheap place to drink. but the vibe was chilled and thy were showing my babes game so we stayed. 

I ordered the Beef sandwhich w/ au jus. Never had one before but this was pretty good. with french fries - it was a lot of food - see foto. I could only eat half before getting stuffed. 
My bf ordered the philly - wow. now that looked delicious. I think he won but he says it was a draw since his cole slaw wasnt good. Very bland. No taste - not mayo, and not vinegar. just bland. Kinda hospital foody. 
TIP: do not get the cole slaw. Get fries or ask for a side salad if possible?  For $9 I'd think they should let you. lettuce is cheaper than fries last time I ckd. 
Ck ur newpaper before you toss all those fliers that kill trees: occasionally they will throw Sweet Tomatoes & Timbers coupons out there. Again, had they not allowed drinks in the mix we'd not have gone. 
they also had oen coupon that was bogof for up to $8.00 This would be a good one to use if ur not drinking that night."}
{"text":"This is a great place for grabbing some breakfast while watching football. There's enough screens that they can usually put what ever game you want on. Servers are always very nice.

$6 gets you 2 eggs, hash browns, toast and the best ever bacon. Their bloody mary is spicy and tasty too. Good drink and food specials during football games."}
{"text":"I'd never been to one of these but needed a drink after work one Saturday and BWW was entirely too crowded because of UFC.  

Service at the bar was pretty good.  The drinks were reasonably priced.  But HOLY SMOKE.  I realize now why I NEED to go to a place like BWW's bar when I just want some drinks, because there's no smoking there.  But, naturally, since this place is 21 and over - unlike BWW - and has gaming you can smoke to your heart's delight.  And people do.  They nearly smoked me out of the place.  (I'm not judging, I just can't handle all that smoke sometimes.  And some places do a better job of \"filtering\" it than others).  

I always get seemingly pretty good coupons for this place in the mail, the bar food looks pretty good, and I think they serve breakfast all day so it would be perfect for me here.  It is a good option for cheap drinks and gaming locally but the smoke will likely keep me away."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!

This Timbers is located fairly close to my house - at Gibson and American Pacific, and they were recently listed in the RJ has a \"Chargers\" bar for this football season.  Since Beach House, our previous Chargers bar closed, I was looking forward to checking out a new place.

We were kind of forced in to going here for the 1st game of the season - just before game time, a HUGE storm hit, which knocked out our power and satellite. It did come back on, but I didn't want to risk this happening during the game, so we headed out to Timbers.

There are 2 different areas of this place - a restaurant side, with tables and booths - for all ages (and non smoking).  Then the glass enclosed bar side, where it's 21 and up only, and smoking is allowed.  This, of course, is where we sat.

They have plenty of TVs and a decent sound system.  The bartender was super friendly and provided great service.  We ordered drinks (they had beer and drink specials) and also food (also discounted).  I had the turkey burger sliders, which came with regular fries, and my Mom had the sweet potato fries.  Both were really good.  I was surprised at how good the turkey burger sliders were - and that they had a ton of toppings, including a slice of avocado.  Pretty good deal for $6.95.

Everyone was friendly, they had great prices and there were quite a few Chargers fans.  Since it's much closer than Michael's Pub, I will certainly be returning when my heartbreaking Bolts aren't televised!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! First time I came in I felt right at home lol where the best drinks in the world are made! Hella thick shots! For a good price FREEEEEEE LOL"}
{"text":"My classmates and I always come here after our exams (about once a month). 

The bartenders are nice, and always serve us quickly. We ran into one of them at Quinn's on St. Patrick's day and he recognized us, which either means that we go here way too much or he has a fantastic memory. .. Maybe both. 

The spinach & artichoke dip is remarkably delicious. 
Sometimes we get coupons in the mail, which is nice. 

I had to dock two stars for the SMELL. I know this is Vegas(ish) and people are still allowed to smoke inside, but they really need to get some fans or windows or new vents or something. I am definitely not a fan of the stifling stench of old cigarettes and the fact that my hair smells like cigarettes when I leave. Everything else is dandy, though!"}
