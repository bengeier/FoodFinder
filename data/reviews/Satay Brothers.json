{"text":"Went there unexpectedly after grabbing a drink in the area seeking munchies and boy, did Satay Brothers deliver. Great decor and vibe, friendly and laid-back yet attentive service and most importantly, awesome food. We arrived at around 7:30 and thankfully didn't have to wait, though a long cue formed not long after we were seated at a communal, long table (If you seek intimacy in a dinner setting, try for a round table near the back).
Not long after we ordered the tofu buns, seafood laksa and mee goreng with shrimp, our dishes were served up with homey presentation. This fare is Asian comfort food at its finest. The soup was creamy, spicy and full of body with delicate pieces of seafood that were bursting with flavor. The buns were fluffy and perfect, with cucumber slices that wonderfully offset the sauce and grilled tofu (which was cooked superbly). The mee goreng was spicy, flavorful and just plain tasty with a great blend of textures and was my favourite, because I adore noodle dishes of all kinds. Overall, the portions aren't huge, but they're better for sharing and they're authentic-- definitely worth the price for the ambience and fun I had."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Brian L's review here. I was expecting more flavour and found the food mediocre. 

Best for drinks and light food, but not an authentic Singaporean street food kinda dinner."}
{"text":"Overall its an \"okay\" restaurant. Very small interior, nice decor, and interesting \"hipster\" scene. Good food, kinda pricy for the amount you get. This restaurant wouldn't be a competitor in terms of good potion. They're popular because of the environment they provide. The quality of the food is fresh and delicious. I'd recommend trying it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Succulent! On a aimé tout ce qu'on a mangé, 4 plats à partager en tout: 
- Beignets
- Boeuf braisé & riz
- Brochette de poulet
- Salade de papaye verte

Dessert de sandwich à la crème glacéee.

Le service était impeccable, très chaleureux et sympathique.

Tout ça pour 48$, une aubaine. On y retourne à la première occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because I was craving some authentic Asian food and Satay Brothers had high ratings on Yelp. As an Asian, I was very unimpressed with this place. The decor was cool, captured the Asian street food feel with the dingy wooden furniture, red lanterns, the feel and atmosphere was promising. Service was good (nothing bad, nothing good). Food was okay and the portions were small (in Asia street food is cheap and good and filling). Honestly, the cheap flowery plastic plates were probably the most 'authentic' part to this restaurant. Pretty disappointed in this place. 

Braised Pork Bun (2/5):
This was what I was really looking forward to eating...and was sadly disappointed in the lack of flavours. It looks so good in pictures and has so much potential. In an authentic pork bun, the meat isn't drenched in Hoisin sauce and you can actually taste the braised meat. All I tasted in my buns was hoisin sauce and it ended up being gross and too salty so I couldn't enjoy the flavours or the actual meat and veggies. This is not authentic.

Laksa (3/5):
First of all this was like 10 bucks and there were barely any noodles. This isn't an entree. Noodles are the cheapest part so I don't understand why they didn't give me more noodles. This is also probably the cheapest dish to make so charging $10 for barely three spoonfuls of noodles is ridiculous. That being said, flavours were alright. It was nice and spicy, however, I would've liked more cocunut-y flavour in my soup. If you're looking to just get a taste of Malay cuisine (not make it a meal), this would be a good option for you.

3 Satays (3.5/5):
It was okay. Hard to fuck up on grilled meat. 

Beef Rendang (3.5/5)
This was okay too. I wish it had more flavours and the beef was more tender. The portions were good for this dish"}
{"text":"I love me some brothers. How not to? They are outgoing funny and real. I rely on these boys and occasional girl to feed me at least twice a week.
My preferred menu is the following:
2x coco pure drank in quick succession
6 sticks, anything but shrimp 
Gado gado, extra sauce
Kueh salat
Only down side is the wait but I am cool with that."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Laksa, but the buns are pretty good, so do their dessert. Portion is not very big but good for a light meal. Come early otherwise there is line-up."}
{"text":"This is what my dreams are made of. I have been back several times and can't wait to go again. The pork buns, short ribs, and skewers are a must! The ambiance and service are also fantastic. I have no complaints other than I wish I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"I personally thinks this is one of the best spot to eat in Mtl. The service is amazing, food is awesome and the ambiance is simply the best! I could go there every week. Our waiter Alex was so charming, the entire evening was a perfect! He recommandes the fried rice and his suggestion was on the spot. I live right next door and I'll definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Visited on Boxing Day. The server was helpful. Our favorite was char su bo ( pork bun ). We started with two. It was addictive enough that we ordered two more.  We also had two noodle dishes. The egg and flat rice noodles were savory. 
Overall, it was definitely a happy place to have lunch."}
{"text":"The Satay brothers are bringing to Montreal the tastes and flavours of what they were brought up on - their south-east Asian background. Major points for having their mom in the kitchen for the summer making sure that what they're putting out has the official mom \"stamp of approval\". Sharing with the Atwater Market and at the same time, transporting me back to a place where if I closed my eyes, I could swear I was 15,000kms away is an accomplishment in itself... up until my bubble was popped by hearing some guy yell out \"AWAYE ostie\", because I was standing there like an idiot, eyes closed in front of his car as he was trying to park."}
{"text":"The pork belly buns make me feel deep carnal emotions, the ribs are sticky and delicious, and the only thing better than the gado gado salad is saying the name. Must try - even better in the summer when they are open in Atwater Market!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this place lass than 5 stars!!  Audrey, Magic, and Phil made me feel so welcomed and comfortable. They do customer service right.  I enjoyed the food, great beer, and cocktails, music and warm friendly atmosphere. Thank you ever so much for making my visit to Montreal special. You guys are the best! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préférés dans Saint-Henri. Tout est excellent mais, j'ai un faible pour la salade de papaye verte et les nouilles aux crevettes et palourdes, à essayer absolument! Service impeccable et ambiance géniale."}
{"text":"Awesome find.  This was definitely the busiest prepared food stand at Atwater Market.  Every item on the menu sounded so good that we had a hard time choosing.  We ordered the laksa (spicy noodle soup) and papaya salad.  Both were awesome."}
{"text":"Food: the downside to this place is sadly the food~ the noodles were bathed in oil, the satay skewers were burned and the papaya salad had a bitter aftertaste this time

Service: very attentive although when it gets busy it can be harder to get the waiter's attention

Price: honestly the drinks were overpriced, more than half of the pitcher was filled with ice, if I'm paying for a drink, i expect to get REAL drinks, not tons of ice~

Ambiance: lay back lounge-bar decor, very busy at night. Cute bar to watch the staff at work while u enjoy ur meal, otherwise there are always regular tables~"}
{"text":"Good food, especially the papaya salad and the meat skewers  Also, awesome customer service...!"}
{"text":"Satay Brothers is the best food I have had in Montreal. Full Stop. Run by two Asian-Polish brothers Matt and Alex who grew up in the hood and know what food needs to be and what is missing from Montreal eats.

They source their meat from the local butcher and use the freshest ingredients. They operate a tight ship of flavor that will have you addicted upon first taste. I remember coming in for the first day this 2012 season and bought the chicken satay (which comes with marinated cucumbers and a to-die-for nut sauce), and Alex gave me a sampling of their Laksa soup. I sat down and was in no way prepared for the intsta-foodboner (WHICH HAS YET TO SUBSIDE ON MULTIPLE VISITS). Since I live in the hood I come fairly often, and not just because Alex has a charm no one can escape. 

Their satays change depending on the day (chicken, pork, shrimp). If you're really hungry go for the papaya salad that is a perfect addition of crunch and acid for the satay. I've never had the steamed pork bun but my friend did and he loved it. If only I wasn't gluten free I would eat their whole menu... in one go.

 Plus, they have a staff of some of the cutest guys in the hood. I don't mind. The thought of them opening a resto makes my whole body full of mini explosions in anticipation. 

Go here! Wait in the crazy line! Just do it. Honestly, it's worth it. So worth it. Plus, what else are you gonna eat? Carbs and carbs?"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and every time its absolutely amazing. Doesn't matter if its in the resto, the market, or the pop up."}
{"text":"Great service. Food is ok. Pricey if you look at the quantity. Taste is also on the average end. Nothing to write home about. Cocktails are expensive ($12) for a place slightly upscale from a \"dive\". Caipirinha was not even close in taste. Lot of young folks. 3 stars purely for the friendly service."}
{"text":"My visits to Satay Brothers, either in Atwater Market or on rue Notre Dame, are never disappointing. The food is consistently excellent across their always changing menu and the brothers go out of their way to make their customers feel special. My faves are the soft silky buns (melt in your mouth slow braised pork belly lightly dressed with hoisin and some sliced cucumbers), the papaya salad with or without tender pork; spicy beef salad (cabbage, heirloom tomatoes, fried garlic, mint, carrots). They will adjust the heat to your liking, 3x was quite the kick!"}
{"text":"I adore it here! The menu isn't very extensive, but every item is a winner and the service is attentive and fast (there are many brothers looking out for you here.) I would die happy eating the melt-in-your-mouth beef rendang."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been there many times and my enthusiasm is still the same. The food is good and tasty.  The laksa soup... I just can't get enough of it, the price value is also pretty good. You can share all your plates.
 If you're a group of 3 and more I would highly suggest that you reserved. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food on a cold winter night, cash only please!

Another indonesian joint to add to the list!!! I count 3 so far, Nonya, and Gado-Gado and now Satay Bros, let me know if you guys find another, better yet someone find me a Malaysian resto in Mtl!!!

There's maybe 10 or 11 items on the menu, we ordered six of them, would have ordered 7  but the waiter said it was too much and talked us out of the extra dish. It was a good call cuz that extra dish would have been too much.

The place is small bus cosy and it's open kitchen. The staff is friendly and laid back. The appetizers are 2-6$ and mains run about 7-10$. The dishes are not too large but are a good deal considering the price. I'd recommend two appetizers and 2-3 mains for two ppl who share food. We ordered 3 apps and 3 mains but we eat a lot :) yeah I'm fat and I like it lol.

On to the food, we had: satay, pork buns, and papaya salad for appetizers, and laksa, mee goreng and beef rendang for mains.

Satay is basically grilled skewered meat, this one was chicken. It was served with peanut dipping sauce and a side of cucumbers. This version however is marinated with lemongrass, which in all my satay eating experience is a first. Lemongrass is commonly used in vietnamese cuisine especially for grilled meat, so it is a flavor that I like and am familiar with. I do recommend this satay for it's lemongrass flavor.

The pork buns are soft in texture, and the pork is tender. it is garnished with cucumber, coriander and hoi sin sauce. The sauce is a bit too sweet, but all together it is very good, at 3$ a pop, it's on the pricey side.

The papaya salad was very good, it has a strong tangy taste but salted and sweetened just right to balance it out, this goes very well with the pork buns. Add some papaya to your pork buns to balance out the bun's sweetness, oh yeah that's right mix it up.

Laksa, which a seafood noodle soup with coconut and curry. It was well salted, just enough that would balance out the blandness of the vermicelli, but not so salty that you were thirsty at the end of a bowl. It is mildy spicy and the spiciness accumulates as you eat. They also provide a bit of hot paste on your spoon at serving for those who wish to add more hotness. I opted to not add it because I don't like it too spicy.

Mee goreng, Mtl we have a new best mee goreng!!! well by default anyways lol. I've always thought the mee goreng at Nonya was the best, but last time I was there ~2010 it was no longer on their menu :( so since the other one is no longer available, this is the new best! It is served with a wedge of lime and I strongly recommend you add the lime and mix before eating. The flavors are very strong in a mee goreng, and it can get overpowering quickly so the lime tempers it a bit, makes it milder. This one is a bit spicy too which is a nice touch.

Beef rendang, this is perhaps the best rendang I've ever had in a restaurant. The sauce is not too greasy, it's balanced in terms of salt and sweet, and mildy spicy on the back end. As you eat the dish the spiciness increases and at the end you're like shit that was hot, wham there you go that's rendang! even though I know this, I always lather the sauce on my rice cuz it's so good, but only put it on half your rice, save the other half to temper the spiciness at the end :)

Best meal I've had in a long while :) Now go!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the amazing rating. The hip people?  The bar-like ambiance?  The drinks?  Because the food was simply okay considering the price and the size of the portions (rather small).  I guess the friendliness of the staff helps.  Good spot for young people to chill, for whom eating is simply secondary to drinking and chatting.  For those who actually love eating, one visit may be enough."}
{"text":"Having lived in Asia, I must admit I was skeptical at first. The place is decked out in stereotypical and cliché traditional Chinese decor from the 1960s. It didn't help that one of the Caucasian waiter was dressed in Chinese clothes (albeit, I'm not totally sure if that was intentional). But the food was really good and authentic--we tried almost everything on the menu and I'd say you can't go wrong especially given that everything is reasonably priced (for Canada). For desserts, I liked the green crepe roll the most--the other cakes weren't as tasty. If you eat a lot, it might not be a good idea to get the tapas (the pork belly bao was just so-so). Also, there is always a lineup so you might not want to be starving before you leave your house, or you'll end up super hangry. Lastly, the service was also amazing (one of the waiter's gave us free wine for forgetting one of our orders) and the general vibe was hip, fun, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Speaking as a Malaysian, their Laksa is pretty damn good! 

Solid customer service too. Chatted with the staff, great people all around. I would definitely hit up their sister restaurant for a second round since their menu is larger."}
{"text":"Oh satay brothers!!! This might be one of my favorite place to go! The ambiance and the food are the best. I go there every week and i enjoy it everytime!! I know pretty well the crew and they are the most down to earth people i know. They know what they want and how to achieve it perfectly. Every bites you take is a trip to malaysia. They know that i like my food spicy so they always bring me a side of fresh chili. I will never get tired of this food."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place based on the rave reviews. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my experience here. As others have said, portions are small and thus overpriced. Three little chicken skewers (essentially 1-2 bites per skewer) for $8?? One mini-bun (about 3/4 the size of my palm) for $5.75?? Food was decent, but is essentially just grilled food we can make at home. Didn't try the salad or soup, which are undoubtedly more difficult to make and I will update this review if we ever go back and try them. 

Service was also a disappointment; we were smiley and polite, but the cashier was very standoffish and dismissive -- like he was one of the cool kids in high school. Although to be fair, the cashier (one of the brothers) was a lot nicer to regulars/friends, as well as an elderly tourist after us -- I guess we have to be regulars or about 30 years older in order to be treated with a little more kindness. 

I'm not complicated -- I need either awesome service, or good deals to like a place. This place unfortunately did not have either. 

I don't get the hype. At all."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I heard so much about this place, we just HAD to try it.
Upon arrival there was a lineup, apparently there always is and I understand why. It's a small place, but luckily we were only behind a few people.  We stood and had a drink while waiting, the staff was friendly. As we watched the plates go by we were salivating.  The aromas smelled heavenly.  Once we got to sit down and order, a couple of the things we had were- the papaya salad (amazing), a soup that I do not remember the name of (WOW! spicy, well balanced, and an array of flavours I wasn't 100% familiar with but wanted to get to know very well ;) )We have to go back ASAP! Been thinking about it since."}
{"text":"Not sure what people rave about about this place, hopefully not the low quality ingredients, eg chicken carcasses in a poulet dish, three pieces of shrimp in a shrimp soup.. I'll let you be the judge."}
{"text":"An overall enjoyable experience, if not innovative or especially unique.

We got 3 items, the 2 Buns for $10, Papaya salad with pork for $9.50, and the rice noodle dish for $14.50. The buns were average, with pork belly, cucumber, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. For $5 a bun I wish there was a little more pizzazz for the price, but they were still definitely tasty. The papaya salad was very enjoyable, with a nice level of spice. acidity from the lime, and texture from the addition of peanuts and cilantro. The pork on top was seasoned quite well, too.  (Only personal gripe is that I felt red bell peppers an odd addition but it wasn't bad or anything). The rice noodle dish came with clams, shrimp, and chinese sausage. The clams were really nice, and I really like the addition of the chinese sausage. Overall everything was prepared well and the portion sizes were bigger as well.

The trendy atmosphere was not really for me, but I can appreciate the care they put into making the decor colorful and vibrant. Honestly, if the buns were either cheaper or more interesting I would probably give it a five, as the service was extremely fast and helpful as well."}
{"text":"We live near the market and have been familiar with their amazing food for a few years now. But the real reason I'm writing a review is because of their customer service. Even though they have a line up out the door on a Friday night they will still greet you with a smile and offer you a seat at the bar when you just want a few of the steamed pork buns for take out. No matter how popular they've become they still treat their customers well and continue to make great food."}
{"text":"Stood and waited to be seated. A bartender stared at me, made eye contact a few times and looked away. 
After a long time, a waiter pointed me to a table. 
Sat and waited for a menu, a glass of water, anything. No one came. I left. 

Crowded, noisy, literally no service. Not just bad service, no service."}
{"text":"Arrived 7pm on a Sunday, and were promptly greeted and offered seats at a shared table. We asked to sit at the bar instead, no problem. We got menus, water, and... that was it. Service completely neglected us (but not so the two people who arrived after and sat next to us, and apparently knew some of the staff), and due to the awkward location we couldn't flag anyone down. So we left :( I hate to be that guy leaving this type of review, but it is what it is..."}
{"text":"Yum-yum. Not only are the brothers entertaining and fun to meet but their food is absolutely delicious. Thank goodness they have a winter home...i will be there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I had dinner on Saturday.  The service was prompt and attentive.  The atmosphere was hip.  But the food could do better. Their satay and fried noodles were too salty and the laksa needed more flavor. I have been wanting to try this restaurant for so long and it was a huge let down."}
{"text":"food was really good and the service was some of the best i've ever had. it was our first night in montreal and we couldn't have had a more welcoming experience. we ordered based on recommendations from our waiter (lobster chow mein, which was delicious) and they gave us dessert and an apertif on the house. what a great introduction to this city!"}
{"text":"The best spot in st-henri if you want amazing Singaporean food (the best comfort food), or just an amazing homemade cocktail. The staff is great and really friendly. They take care of you even during the busy diner hours and it's always a quick service from the kitchen . It's a small spot and it gets really crowded, with the decor it makes a vibrant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Satay Brothers and I can now indulge eating their delicious food even during winter. Since they opened on St-Jacques, I have been twice and it is as good as ever. A great spot for lunch but also for dinner, as beginning this week they will be opened evenings from Thursday to Sunday nights. Great news for all the foodies in town.

My favourites : satays, green papaya salad, and steam buns."}
{"text":"When you first enter Satay Brothers, the interior is perfectly kitchy and cheesy with knick nacks and a bright red interior. There is a full bar and a variety of Asian inspired dishes such as stinky noodles and soup noodles.

I really liked the level of spicyness of the food and the service was friendly but not overbearing. They even had some games that you could play like marble checkers etc that brought me back to my childhood. 

The food itself was okay but not amazing. I really liked have a cold beer with the spicy noodles however I felt like the flavours weren't strong enough. Maybe with a bolder take on the Asian dishes Satay Brothers could become the forefront of asian dining in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant on a Wednesday evening not expecting too much of a crowd but came to find it packed before, during, and after our dinner. There was a slight wait but they keep things moving quickly! The pork belly steamed buns were to die for, an absolute foodgasm. The short ribs are a must, absolutely amazing as well. The sauce had a kick to it but with molasses like sweetness. Great wine as well, don't be afraid to order by the glass, the menu only shows prices by the bottle. Definitely a must stop in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very classic south east Asia flavor. Ordered Laksa and pork buns. The buns are sooooo soft and fresh. Makes me miss home. Laksa mlends the flavor of coconut milk, coriander, and pea sprout well. Love them."}
{"text":"Shhh... this was my little secret for years. Stop telling other people about it. The lines are getting too long. We don't want anyone enjoying this and telling others. So, just keep it our secret at the market and tell others to look for their Indonesian food elsewhere! We don't want everyone partaking of their interesting soups, salads and satay. So remember... Shhhhhh..."}
{"text":"Great food, but tight location and there was almost a line out the door. Rather than sit in line, we ordered to take out. The food was great, though and really had great Indonesian flavours."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really fun!!! And the food tastes really good as well! They have a really good lemonade drink. The only issue I have is that portion sizes are rather small given the price.... And yet I still keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Straightforward, no-frills good eats. Tasty buns and green papaya salad. Easy, low-key vibe. Cute boys, too :)"}
{"text":"Incontournable a Montreal. Very personal and friendly service. Excellent Asian food. Try the tofu steam buns and papaya salad. Vegetarian friendly. Cash only. Casual ambiance. Will be back again and again! That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"$8 + tip for about 75 grams of cooked brown chicken meat. Yeah, it's definitely a luxury for those craving an south East Asian inspired flavours and don't feel like hunting a good authentic place. But Satay does the job!"}
{"text":"I am from Singapore. So it is hard to judge here. Glad to find this place but I have to be honest in my judgement. But overall, great price, great quality. I think they should ought to improve ingredients to make the dishes more authentic. Nyonya in Manhattan wins."}
{"text":"C'était ma toute première fois hier soir avec des amis habitués du Satay Brothers. J'avais donc des attentes. En entrant, j'ai été impressionné par le décor et l'ambiance du restaurant. Mes amis et moi avions commandé des plats à partager et je dois avouer que j'ai adoré tout ce qui était dans nos assiettes (Pad Thai crevettes, boeuf, légumes sautés, salade de papaye, etc). Ce qui m'a également impressionné est la rapidité et la qualité du service reçu. Le prix était raisonnable pour tout ce que nous avons eu. Bref, c'est un 5 étoiles sans hésiter et j'ai déjà hâte de répéter l'expérience."}
{"text":"Wow, my friend and I are vegan and the waiters were so knowledgeable, they tweaked the menu to adapt to our diet. Well done! Delicious! And such a cool decor!"}
{"text":"Excellent comme restaurant! N'hésitez pas à oser des plats qui sortent de l'ordinaire. Je demande rarement des plats au tofu, mais les beignets au tofu et légumes sont hors de ce monde. J'y retourne dès que possible"}
{"text":"After experiencing serious cravings for laksa, my boyfriend and I decided to head to Yelp to find the best restaurant for it. Walking in on a Sunday night, we could immediately see what the hype around this restaurant was about. It doesn't look like much from the outside - in fact, we had a bit of trouble looking for the sign since there was so much construction around - but the inside was trendy and thematic, really reminding me of Asia. 

The restaurant was packed full, but the line was short - we only waited 5-10 minutes before a waiter came and offered us either two seats at the bar or at a bigger table. We choose to share a table with other people; initially, I thought it might be a bit strange to eat with strangers, but we had a nice chat with the guys sitting across from us. The seating was similar to the round table style you see at dimsum, but that caused a bit of confusion with our orders. When two bowls of laksa came, our table-mate, who had a severe gluten allergy, almost didn't realise that his bowl wasn't the gluten-free one. 

As for food, I highly recommend the porn buns; they were some of the best I've ever had. I tried a bit of the laksa, and I enjoyed it, but I didn't Love love it. 

An overall fun experience! I may come back just for the pork buns - haven't stopped thinking about them since."}
{"text":"Satay Brothers is a wonderful, friendly and incredibly delicious. From their very popular stand during the Summer, at the Atwater Market. To their recently renovated location on St.Henri. 
Their food is packed with flavor, as well as simple yet beautifully presented.  With their kind and wonderful sense of humor and kindness, never a dull moment seeing the very hard working guys behind Satay Brothers. 
Their steamed buns, with tender flavorful pork belly, is outstanding. You like some kick? Definitely order their Laksa soup, it packs a great deal of heat, with loads of flavor. A must try!
Their prices are very reasonable, it will make you want to order numerous things from their menu. A great spot, a must try!"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance. Came here on a sunday evening and place got packed pretty quickly. The pork buns are really good. Would had fed myself just on that. The papaya salad was ok but a bit too watery. I had the beef stew which was good. Would come back for the pork buns and need to try their tamarind cocktail."}
{"text":"WOW !! before coming bere i heard a lot of good things about this place... but was here ... I was amazed ! loved the food, the staff and the place ! I tried a couple of thinga on the menu and everything is freshly made, all ingredients are fresh ! PLS make it your journey to go to this place !"}

{"text":"The Satay Bros are serving up some of the best south-east Asian fare here in Montreal, one of the few things I missed once I left the Pacific Rim. Their stall is in the busy Atwater market during the warm seasons and line-ups are generally long.

I ordered a couple of pork satays, their grilled pork sandwich and the gado-gado salad.

First, their satays were grilled to perfection. Very juicy and as requested, extra spicy. Homemade peanut sauce was a nice touch. The pork sandwich was good, but far to small to justify the $6.95 I paid for it. The gado-gado salad was awesome to cool yourself on a hot, humid summer day."}
{"text":"I give this place so much of my money and I have absolutely no problem with that. The food is awesome, super authentic and delicious. They're consistent, the flavour is always tangy and sweet and incredibly fresh. They have their staple menu and then daily specials that are always impressive. The staff is also notable. Everyone is really nice and hospitable and the owner goes out of his way to make it a personal experience. I had no experience eating Singaporean food before Satay Brothers and it's quickly become a staple in my diet."}
{"text":"Satay Brothers may well be the best Singaporean/Malaysian restaurant east of Vancouver. Ok I can't know this for a 100% fact, but I'm pretty sure. 

After frequenting their summer location at Atwater market I was thrilled to learn that Satay Brothers finally setup a more permanent location nearby. The restaurant is very cozy, seating about 20 people at a mix of small tables and long communal style tables. 

We had  proc and tofu buns, Laksa, Mee Goreng and Gado Gado salad. Everything was terrific, but the winner for me was the Gado Gado salad, perhaps that was because of the peanut sauce which I love. But, other contributing factors were the freshness of all the ingredients and the mix of terrific flavours and textures. 

The bill for the above came-out to $33. Based on the value, the extreme tastiness of the food and how difficult it is to find good Singaporean/Malaysian cuisine this is a five star review. 

On top of everything else, the guys who run the place are great!"}
{"text":"pork buns
chicken satay
coconut chicken soup

on a chilly fall day,
the coconut chicken soup
is warm, sweet, exotic and so satisfying
all at the same time.
paired with some buns and satay
washed down with cold drafts
makes a great weekend lunch."}
{"text":"Great pork buns! Menu was quite pricey and portions were small... I guess cause it's \"tapas\" style? Cool atmosphere like any other restaurants in st Henri!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good but not great. Loved sitting at the bar; the laksa broth was excellent but the noodles were overcooked and too soft. Great pork buns but pretty pricy for just 2. I'd come again and try something different."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic food and staff in a laid back atmosphere. Try the papaya salad and shrimp sandwich when they have it on the menu."}
{"text":"Je suis completement fan des Satay Brothers. Le lieu est hipster au bout, j'aime le contraste entre la déco asiatique classique et un son hip hop. Je suis charmée. La nourriture est excellente. J'ai choisi une soupe de poulet et crevette coco délicieux accompagné d'une boisson gazeuse au gingembre. Accrochez-vous le gingembre est un peu fort mais c'est super bon.
Mon petit malus, si l'on considert que c'est un malus, ce resto est super populaire, donc il y a un monde fou et manifestement c'est aussi assez bruyant."}
{"text":"Wow! Bun (pain vapeur) au porc braisé avec concombre, ça goûte le paradis! Le porc est tendre et caramélisé, il fond. Avec la fraîcheur du concombre c'est merveilleux.

Service cool et courtois. 

J'ai essayé le Tofu qui était également bon, mais j'y retournerai pour essayer le reste du menu. 

C'est à l'entrée du marché atwater et le kiosque le plus populaire. 

Ils ont de la soupe, salade, brochettes, bières, alcool fort, limonade, liqueurs, eau de coco.

À essayer et réessayer."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed.

It doesn't take much to impress me. Just feed me some good delicious food and I'm a happy gal. Unfortunately Satay Brothers didn't do that for me.

We went during lunch hour - about 8 of us. It was pretty bustling like a lot of the famed restaurants in this part of town around this time. The decor is beautiful! And it feels a lot like a little secret spot since the entryway doesn't really tell you that this is a restaurant.

We all ordered at the same time. I had the gado gado salad for a light lunch. My plate came first, and then everyone else's in about 10,15, or 20 minute intervals. My meal was eaten long before the other half of the table got their meals. 

The dish itself was very bland. I've had something similar at my local grocery store that had more flavour. We all agreed the long wait wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"The only  good things on the menu were the appetizers which we waited forever for. Too bad we finished our accompanying beers before that. Found a rusty screw in one of our dishes which looked like a hot mess. And we were still drinking our beer after we paid our bill, when one of their inexperienced staff thought they were being helpful when they told us that we should leave soon because they have \"like 20 people\" waiting for our table. Fuck That."}
{"text":"All the food (pork buns, barbecue ribs, noodles, dessert) was great and the open concept kitchen is interesting to see when seated at the bar. Many dishes are on the spicy end but very flavourful nonetheless, and I definitely recommend the pork buns! Prices were reasonable given it's Asian food in Montreal and the quality is good, though some may feel it is little quantity."}
{"text":"I go to this place once a week...and it is because it is awesome.
 Atwater market provides an absolutely great atmosphere,the brothers Matt and Alex are super nice..and the food is amazing. 

I try to have something different each time..they have a set menu and a weekly menu (everything is good!)

Cash only and be ready to wait a few minutes because there is almost always a line up (but worth the wait ;) )"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Loved all of it -- beef rendeng, papaya salad, chicken satay, spring rolls, laksa soup with chicken -- and will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went to the Atwater market for this alone and was utterly disappointed with every dish. Had the skewers, pork bun, spicy salad. All of which came up short based in reputation. 

You'd be better served looking for something else."}
{"text":"My friends recommended this place to me and my roommates. So we decided to drop by over the weekend. The place is pretty packed - be warned you will likely need to sit with other groups. The decor is pretty phenomenal. I love the environment - gives off a hipster vibe as well. 

My friends and I were seated on a high table and provided with the menu.  If you are like us, completely new to the place, you will realize you have no clue on what to order for food. The options are provided with no details. Thankfully, the waiters are extremely helpful - he described all the dishes in so much detail (and enthusiasm) that we could clap by the end. 

After the description we ordered: 3 satay, papaya salad with grilled pork, laksa lemac and the lamb soup with flat noodles. Starting with the 3 satay - nothing special. I did like the sauce - but pricey for what you receive. Papaya salad - my friends absolute favourite. This was a really refreshing dish - sour, spicy and sweet. Laksa lemac - I liked this one out of what we ordered. It has a good kick in flavor - but I don't know if you would say it's a meal..the size feels more like a snack. Lamb soup - big disappointment. Broth was decent, lamb meat was not strong in flavor (probably because it's stewed), but what drove it downhill was probably the noodles. While the noodles are edible - it was like a ball. Usually the starch forms a significant part of your base for dishes. So the fact that it wasn't made well was disappointing - especially with its price. I saw a lot of people have other foods - so I think if I were to come back, I would try other dishes. 

Customer service was good - like I mentioned above, the waiter was extremely helpful. So I definitely think the service was somewhat more impressive than half the food we tried."}
{"text":"Just go!!!!! Great vibe. The owners and staff are the best in the city. The food is so clean and fresh. Always happy leaving this place."}
{"text":"Très ravi"}
{"text":"Ayoye ! Un excellent restaurant a Montréal !!! Satay brother est l'endroit parfait pour sortire de sa zone de confort et manger un repas parfait !

L'experience est vraiment cool , le comptoire installé dans le marché Atwater permet de manger au grand soleil a un endroit exremement vivant ! 

Vraiment un coup de coeur pour cette petite place ! Felicitation au chef !"}
{"text":"Everything you order here is awesome. The service is fast and friendly. There is often a short wait for a table but the lineup moves fast (expect to share a table). We've returned again and again and the quality of the food and service have always been outstanding. Some of their best dishes include the green papaya salad, steam buns, satay, fried chicken legs and the beef rendang. Order as many things as you can! The decor is beautiful too---cool, casual, nice lighting, with a gorgeous carving on the back wall. The only thing that could make this place better is if they expanded the dessert menu a bit (although I guess that would mean having to save room for dessert---might be too much of a sacrifice!)."}
{"text":"Really nice place with good selection of east Asian cuisine. We got the laksa with the pork and tofu buns and chicken satay skewers. The laksa was very tasty and the perfect amount of spicy. I liked the little quail egg inside it too. The buns were super tasty so definitely get them if you're coming here, well worth it."}
{"text":"Another place that got too much hype. Not saying the food is bad, but it didn't live up to the high expectations. I tried the chicken satay and pork buns, which were both pretty good and the service was nice too. 

Overall, I just hoped that the satay was a bit more spicy (idk what the authentic version tastes like, so don't come after me), but I loved the peanut sauce. The pork in the buns was extremely juicy too and tasted good. However, the portions were a bit small imo. Hence, the 3 instead of 4 for the 3.5* place."}
{"text":"Delicious, spicy food for much less than you'd expect to pay. It's no surprise there are often people lined up out the door. One of my favorite places to eat in Montreal, whether its at the restaurant or in the Atwater market."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the one on Notre Dame, mostly because I'm not bombarded by culturally appropriating artwork and decor. I can just focus on the food, while chillin outdoors on a bench in Marche Atwater. The Pork Bun is pretty much all I get and really all I need. Definitely a winner. All that other fluff, meh."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. 

Likes:
- pork belly Bao
- satay w/ peanut sauce

Not bad:
Rice noodles with shrimp, Chinese sausage, and clams

I've had better:
- Spicy greens 

The decor looks like the man cave of some frat boy with an orientalist fetish. Bird cages, tea lanterns, Buddha statues, red walls, Chinese characters, etc. Where I'm from the youngins call it \"doing too much\" but apparently quite a few people find it charming. It also has less of a dining and more of a bar atmosphere when it gets really busy, for whatever that's worth.  

Service was pretty spotty. Once we got our food, our server forgot we existed. We literally sat there for 15 minutes with our tables completely bussed, waiting for the check). By the time we paid, we couldn't wait to get out of there. 

Bottom line: get the Bao and the satay, and get them to go."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with very high expectations!

The atmosphere is unique, and relaxed. The service is excellent, and choice of menu quite decent. The price is also good! 

In terms of vegetarian food we ordered, I think we were underwhelmed. We had the veg of the week with garlic-- which was bland and nothing special. Had the tofu fritters which were extremely salty despite the yogurt sauce. Ordered the vegetarian gado gado which was essentially cold tofu, with a cold half egg and a bland peanut sauce covering soy beans, and then had the tofu buns- which were the best thing we ordered, but still nothing mind blowing. We also shared a pitcher of the alcoholic lemonade- again underwhelming, and essentially just ice.

Possibly the meat containing dishes are better considering the reviews on yelp. But I think as a vegetarian, I would not be going back."}
{"text":"This was a fun place. Ambiance was on point. The staff were nice and very attentive. Food was incredible and I personally liked the small snack sizes - good for ordering variety. Buns were encroyable."}
{"text":"The environment was awesome but the food was mediocre. I like how they infuse the traditional Chinese environment with bar setting and how cool the waiters and waitresses are. 

However the food is too overpriced. The portion is a little bit too small. They are like snacks more than a regular meal. I guess that is not my original expectation. 

We ordered a papaya salad, two pork buns, one laksa and one fried noodles. Among all of those, the fried noodles and the pork buns are not too bad but the portion is a bit small. The papaya salad is a bit watery which is unexpected. Also the taste of laksa is way mild than what I had in the past and I know with such quality, it shouldnt cost $8-9, at most it should cost $6.

To conclude, Satay Bro would be a great place to drink and to have fun, but not really recommending for regular meal."}
{"text":"J'y vais pour la soupe laksa. Bon service, abordable"}
{"text":"This place is a hit in St-Henri Montreal offering various dishes from the South Asian subcontinent. I've always tried their pork buns (steamed) that are very succulent at the Atwater Market. But this time, I wanted to try the restaurant that has the menu offering multitude of options which fits pretty much every appetite whether vegetarian or not. The restaurant decor is awesome that makes it good for dining but it is a bit loud which, in turn, makes it trendy & lively. We ordered a few things that came out pretty quick - Chicken Kapitan, Tofu buns & Satay. 
Pros: ambiance, great vibes, lively, helpful servers
Cons: Stale food (Chicken Kapitän was tasty until the dish was hot but I experienced that it was stale afterwards. The curry wasn't fresh making it difficult to eat and it turned me down), a bit Overpriced for the food offered..."}
{"text":"Pricey for small portions, but food is pretty good.

The satay skewers are small for the cost.  The dark meat chicken was nicely marinated and very juicy.  Pork belly buns were good, but also a bit pricey for the size.

It was my first time having laksa and I will be hunting this dish down again somewhere.  This was my favorite dish at Satay Brothers.

I liked all the food I had from Satay Brothers, but portion sizes compared to cost are my only complaint."}
{"text":"The place is lovely and has an exotic look. Wine is delicious. All of this makes for a romantic/posh atmosphere or a cool place to hang out with your friends ; could be a perfect place for 5 a 7. They have fingers foods and appetizers for those days when you're only in for a drink with friends. 
We had vegetarian noodles, they were fine - but not wow. The steam bum with tofu was on the drier size, if you like saucy stuff maybe pass up on this one. I'll have to come back to try their other vegetarian options. Atmosphere was killing it and gave a charm to this place - this will bring me back!"}
{"text":"Mon resto préféré de Montreal. La bouffe est ultra délicieuse, elle plaira à tous. L'ambiance est très le fun, c'est jeunne, c'est familial en début de soirée et de party après 8h. Belle carte des veins, beaux cocktails. La deco est super, on se sent voyager. L'addition est abordable (c'était un peu moins cher j'ai l'impression avant..). Je ne crois pas qu'il y ai de réservation. L'idéal est d'arriver vers 18h car à 19h c'est full. Ne pas manquer la salade de papaye verte et les ribs!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delectable. A great spot to bring friends, could honestly just go here as a \"bar\" if you wanted. 

Super cool bartenders!"}
{"text":"I tried the green papaya salad with grilled pork. It's very refreshing, spicy, and tasting authentic. Yes, not the \"oriental sauce\" from westernized Asian restaurant. You'll know the difference when you try it. The desert was exactly like the Thai style deserts I tried in a top tier Thai restaurant in Shanghai. Definitely will come back with friends to explore more dishes.

This place is very busy at night. With the red lanterns and Asian decorations it feels almost like a movie scene. The waiter took me straight my to the back bar, where you can watch how the chef preparing food in the open kitchen. As I was amazed with the food, it turns out the two ladies sitting by me are owner's friends and one is the wife of the chef! We had a great talk. You never know what kind of adventure you may get here;)"}
{"text":"Super tasty. Relatively unique place for Montreal. The food is just delicious but a little bit expensive."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to their winter location. The place is very cosy and love the red lantern at the front door. Ordered a bunch of stuff-chicken skewers, gado gado salad, the laksma lemak soup, some beef patty sandwich with radishes. The issue is that while the food was tasty, my expectations were higher. The spice and zing that i remember from their outdoor Atwater location was lacking, and the beef sandwich, while the meat cooked just right, was dry and the advertised spicy mayo was barely to be found within. The salad was nothing special, just green beans, potatoes and not very tasty tofu with their peanut sauce. The best was the soup, and the peanut dipping sauce. I would go back to the Atwater location if i were shopping at the market, but i don't see myself going out of my way to go to the winter location as a destination itself. Prices are very reasonable though! I would give it 3.5 stars if i could"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the Satay Brothers' winter location shortly before they re-open at the market. (Mind you, it was a wintery night, which is relevant because the place is small - seats around 20 - and there is very little room to queue inside. Be warned.)

The decor is warm, and suggestively Asian, but honest and simple - kinda like the Satay Brothers themselves ;-). The menu is also simple but varied, with the satay du jour providing extra variety. I was surprised and happy that they serve alcohol as well as their amazing array of exotic juices, which kept the kids and non-alcohol-drinkers very happy.

The food was delicious, as usual. Most memorable were: the tiny pieces of hot chilis in the green papaya salad, which add extra zing to the refreshing taste and crunchy texture; the spiciness of the seafood mee goreng, and the tender firmness of its noodles; the otak otak (fish cake in a banana leaf), served with cucumber, egg and sauce on the side (I wish I knew what it was - made with tamarind maybe?), which was such a tangy \"sweet and sour\" combination. We also had beef rendang, tofu steamed buns, chicken satay skewers. It was all super tasty.

The service was so friendly and warm, it made the whole experience even better. Finally, the music was eclectic and a real pleasure to listen to, without overwhelming the atmosphere.

We left feeling completely satay-sfied!"}
{"text":"Location: In the Southwest on Notre-Dame, west of Atwater. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and you're looking at about a 10-minute walk from there. Street parking is available [metered and un-metered].

The place: Dimly lit but super cozy. It's got a bar vibe going on and is pretty casual. There are communal tables so you can get to know your neighbours. I really liked the space.

The goods: I went with the Laksa Lemac, which is a soup with noodles, fish cakes, shrimp, boiled egg and SPICE. I liked the spice - it cleared up my sinuses. If you're not a fan of the heat, then let them know. I'm sure they can tone it down for you. I also tried a steamed bun with marinated tofu. As far as the soup goes, I really liked it. The bun was OK but it didn't blow me away because it was a little bland. Also, I couldn't really taste the marinade. Maybe my expectations were too high because while I did enjoy the food, I didn't leave there feeling wowed. I plan to go back to try the green papaya salad that I've heard so much about. 

Service: Honestly, everyone was pretty blasé and indifferent. The only guy that was friendly toward us was the bus boy. Our wait staff was rather inattentive and couldn't seem to be bothered. 

Price point: Average and depends on what you order."}
{"text":"The food is good, flavourful and unique. Pork bun was my choice BUT it's such a small portions for the price:( The piece of a pork was literally 2x2 cm and did look quite lonely in the bun priced $6.. I couldn't believe they charge so much for two bites o.O And with a simple drink my food came to $10.. Satay Brothers pricing their salads and soups with/without meat - meatless versions are already being quite pricey (considering it's a market with no proper tables/no washrooms/people walking). Although the food was good I won't be coming back as Montreal has lots to offer in the same price range."}
{"text":"Gotta give it to them their food is crazy flavourful. 

I first tried satay brothers at the other location and wasn't a fan.

I decided once in for all that the steam buns needed to be purchased so I got in a little roped line where there was 5 ppl ahead of me. I got 2 buns 2 sandwich and a papaya green salad. Sandwich of the day was a meat sandwich tasted almost like hamburger and a well seasoned kefta. The other sandwich was okay but lacking meat. 

I 100 percent will be back"}
{"text":"Nice food ! Great ambience !  I would definitely come back to this place .
The pork is really good .
The portions are small .. but the food is great . Always a busy place."}
{"text":"Thursday night it's the place to be.

Walked by and was looking for a yummy spot I haven't tried. Seen the amount of people inside and realized this was the spot.

The owner was very sweet gave us the best seat beside the window and gave us our menus and water quickly.

The menus isn't huge but make it easier to pick.

Had 6 plates all together to share and the best one was the chicken skewers with the peanut sauce. ( not to sweet and chicken super juicy)

The place started having a line up inside and out and I noticed the owner brought some beers over to the group standing in line and chatted with them for a bit I thought that was super sweet.

Great service , great staff, great restaurant"}
{"text":"So much hype! Maybe the restaurant is better than the Atwater Market stand? I thought there was better vegetarian options. So many people rave about it. The veggie option was okay, not great. People around me seemed to like it."}
{"text":"Nous avons aimé beaucoup de choses lors de notre expérience au Satay! :
- superbe décor asiatique très coloré et chaleureux
- on nous assoit sur des grandes tables de partage, alors on peut se faire des amis à la même table, concept très sympa!
- bouffe vraiment bonne, nous avons pris les rouleaux frits à partager en entrée puis la salade de papaye avec porc, les 2 étaient super bons! A noter que la salade de papaye est un peu \"acide\" à la longue, accompagnée d'autre chose ça atténue un peu l'acidité
- super service
- prix raisonnables selon moi pour l'expérience et la qualité, et même la quantité
- les desserts aussi avaient l'air bons...
Bref, à essayer!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at 6pm.  It was perfect timing; seats available for 2 (no wait), a lineup starts to form only after we got seated, and you don't need to pay for street parking starting at 6.

We are regulars at the Atwater market location.  We had a craving for Singaporean food (the Laksa in particular) and so we decided to visit their dine-in restaurant.

Location was easy to find.  The interior decor was nice - it had a nice comforting feel to it as if you know you are going to have a great homemade meal.  There are birdcages suspended from the ceiling, photos of Singapore, and a collection of vintage cooking appliances on the walls/shelves.  The seating, from what I can see from the entrance (we were seated at the front), were long tables with many chairs.... You may end up sharing a table with other clients.... (Why not strike up a conversation!).

The menu is a 1-page sheet.  We ordered 2 soups and 2 desserts.  It was oh so good!  We devoured everything!  

We ordered the Laksa Lamak, and a beef and shrimp soup that was suggested to us (I don't remember seeing it on the menu, but the bill said \"Meerbus\").  The recepie was right on.  Just as creamy and spicy and tangy as it should be.  The food was served quickly and our waitress, Monica, was friendly and knowledgeable by offering suggestions.  Every sip and bite of the soup was a flavour party in my mouth - every scoop had the right amount of broth, noodles (and meat).  The bowl of soup was the perfect serving size for 1 person each.  If you were really hungry, add some pork buns or the satays to your meal - also highly recommended!

We never had their desserts before so it was our first time trying the coconut wrapped in the green crepe, and the tapioca butter cake.  Perfect choices to end our meal...light, and not too sweet.

This place is highly recommended for couples on dates, trying out a new place with friends, or just grabbing a bite to eat alone.  You will be happy to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The Satay Brothers attentively took our take out order making us comfortable with a drink and the lively Beer, Hop n Bolt. We happily set off to share our repast with friends a few blocks away. Discover they forgot the veggie fritters we called. They apologized,  delivered the fritters and went beyond the call of service. The Satay Brothers sweetened things sending us dumplings and deserts!  How thoughtful and generous!"}
{"text":"What a find this was and in many ways! I am a big fan of Indonesian and Singapore style food. Finding these types of eat in North America in nearly impossible and done correctly totally impossible. 
   Micro small, it's pretty much a hand full of communal table. Simple menu 3-4 choices but what they produce took my tastebuds back to Maxwell Road hawkers center in Singapore! 
   The Laksa was wonderful, rich and spicy and resored me after my 1.9 mile walk from the Marriott. The Mee Goreng was equally amazing. Then to guild the Lilly they gave me a satay for just stopping in. My server wish I recalled his name then gave me 4 other fun places to try while on my foodie weekend craw. They were all fantastic! Thanks for the tips and moreover an amazing lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Get their soup and their steamed buns. Try their Atwater Market location in the summer. It's right next to a good paella place and a good lobster roll place too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!!!! Took great care of our table and all the dishes we shared were awesome especially the braised beef which was quite spicy :)"}
{"text":"Satay Brothers is so good. Laksa soup may just be the best coconut curry soup in the city. It comes in a big bowl with noodles, seafood, bean spouts and a hard boiled egg. To me it's the perfect amount of spicy. I always get the papaya salad and the steamed tofu buns as well.  

The food always tastes so clean and fresh. I love going to their stand at the Atwater Market during the summer months and eating at a picnic table. The restaurant on Notre Dame has a more extensive menu, which includes a wonderful seafood noodle dish, and the decor is super cool. It's low lit with many Chinese lanterns hanging from the wall. It's normally always packed so I would suggest going early."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service. Only thing is, it's super loud in there. You can barely hear yourself think, let alone talk to the people you're with. Other than that, it's a great place if you like really tasty, interesting Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"The place looked awesome and I think the staff was really cool and friendly!
We ordered buns (both tofu and pork), the coconut chili schrimp soup andd another meal consisting of fish cake wrapped in a banana leaf, with rice and other garnish!
I felt like the pork buns were a little too sweet for my taste, but I'd definitly try packing a little papaya salad in it next time! the soup was also good and I liked the kick that the chilies gave to that meal!
Im pretty sure I'm gonna go back to check out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of my friend's dad is Singaporean and he said Satay Brothers is his favorite place because it reminded him of back home...so that says a lot about the food. I've called the restaurant to make reservations for 3 and was told that they only take reservations for groups of 10+. No problem, we just showed up at 8pm on Friday, and let me tell you, this place is packed. After eating here, I can understand why.

Good: The tempeh sandwich was one of my favorite dishes. I don't know what's in that coleslaw, but it was delicious. This spot has a lot of hearty and well marinated grilled dishes. The interior is what Chinatown would look like if it was overrun by hipsters, which is not a bad thing. It has a trendy vibe and a really lively crowd. The prices are very reasonable, in the $5-$15 per dish price range. 

Bad: Okay, food first. I've had the papaya salad on two occasions, and both times it was too soggy. I had to drain my salad because the sauce made it unbearably salty. After that, it was actually pretty good. Another downside is how packed this place gets! We've waited about 25 mins to get a seat at a community table. 

Bottom line: I'll definitely be back, I'll tough it out for the wait. The food and service were pretty good, so that alone would motivate me to come back to Saint Henri (despite its awful roadside construction)."}
{"text":"If you like eating non-authentic Singaporean food with bad - BROish service in a restaurant pretending to be a night club, then this is the place for you. I went on a Friday night and I was pretty much surrounded by pre gamers. Definitely more of a bar vibe than restaurant. We ordered the beef Ren Dang $15.99 and garlic vegetables $6.75b and this green dessert $3.99. Everything was so salty and the atmosphere was just not a place where u can be comfortable eating. I think this place would be fun as a pre-club stop but that's about it."}
{"text":"Came to visit Mtl from Toronto and found this place through Yelp. Ordered a bunch of food, which were all good but the top dishes to die for were the pork ribs, pork belly and shrimp baos, and the lamb skewers. Sooo good! This will be a must go spot everytime I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Laksa is amazing, take the one with chicken! Pork belly bun and tofu buns are average, but meeting the expectations. Satay chicken brochettes i'd recommend, their peanut sauce is very good . The staff is also super friendly and cool! The only inconvenience is cash only, but there are atm machines all around. Definitely one of the best places around the market! If you haven't tried it yet you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the pork buns... You gotta try them! They're soft fluffy steamed buns with a melt in your mouth pork belly garnished with mini cucumber slices, coriander and hoisin sauce. I'm telling you, these trump hotdogs any day! I don't see them slowing down in popularity at all, I love their eclectic Asian inspired decor; it makes me think of a street dining experience in a narrow alleyway somewhere in Asia.  The SBs all have their themed t-shirts, one of the guys said his tee was printed from a painting that an artist did for SBs and they turned it into a graphic tee. So there's definitely a unique theme and vibe, they are the brothers after all.  Your best bet here is to show up early! Otherwise there will be wait time.  I think the hype does make up for a part of the experience as I found the papaya salad wayyyyy too tangy, and I've had it before but it shouldn't be enamel eroding. Their portions are good in the sense that you can order a couple entrées and eat it together because it's not very filling as a single dish. There's a couple round tables for large groups but most of the seating is bar style for eating side by side. Overall, I like the experience, the food, and the service."}
{"text":"Once we navigated there across town and parked way out and meandered down the construction zone, we were seated intimately in the window alcove tucked away from the din and clamor of the restaurant and it's full dining room, as everyone else had the same great idea and taste.

We ordered plate after plate and shared it all, eating until we were stuffed and happy with the entire world.

It's been over a month and I wish I could go back and soak it all in again, the warm ambience, the cozy wooden table, the fragrant spicy delicious aroma, and the simple tasty presentation for just gorgeous food.

Our waiter also was so helpful with ideas for where else to try the rest of our stay, and everyone was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is special and warm. 

We ordered the laksa, steam bun, tempeh satay, papaya salad and vegetarian fritters. The laksa was tasty but a bit cold. Their buns and papaya salad are a must to try! The tempeh satay and the vegetarian fritters were less tasty.

Their deserts, kueh salat & kueh bengka are not to miss. They are tasty and not too sweet like other deserts. 

Small portions so you won't be full with just one plate. It's more a place for sharing!"}
{"text":"Première fois chez Satay Brothers et je reviendrai ! Le serveur, proactif,  nous a suggéré des plats en portions réduites afin de goûter à plusieurs choses étant donné que le choix était difficile à faire. C'était excellent"}
{"text":"Cool hipster inspired Asian spot in the Saint Henri neighbour. I enjoyed an evening there recently with a nice warm vibe. Music was at a perfect volume, lights nicely dimmed. My girlfriend an I enjoyed a few shareable dishes and a pitcher of Dark & Stormy! 


Came back with a 5 star! How dare I only give them 4! The place, vibe, food and staff are DOPE-ASS-FUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Lorsque tu passe dans la rue notre dame et que tu vois cet endroit, tu demande comment ça s'appelle pas de nom sur la devanture du magasin mais alors je vous conseil fortement de vous y arrêter ! 
Tres large choix de boisson pour ce qui est de la carte elle n'est pas immense mais alors par contre tout ce que j'ai pris était vraiment bon et pas cher ! 
Line up a l'entrée Mais c'est assez rapide ! 
Je recommande fortement"}
{"text":"La salle est accueillante et le personnel sympa. Bon endroit pour manger et prendre un verre pour l'atmosphère et bouffe sans prétention."}
{"text":"I am in love with Satay Brothers. They are the popular kids on the block. They are spicy yet cool! I love their satay, curry noodle soup with chicken, braised pork belly, and great beers. I'm not yet finished with my food but I already want seconds; damn the line is too long now! Don't miss Satay Brothers."}
{"text":"Amazing hole in the wall place. The servers make their own food recommendations so don't bother thinking too much about what to order. The food is succulent and very flavorful. It's an evolving menu and there is plenty of room in the restaurant now (these guys used to be much smaller)."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and check out Satay Brothers and I am glad I did. The restaurant did not have any signage and is located across the street from one of my other Montreal favorites Sumac. It is reachable about a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station (Lionel Groulx). Was a happening place. 

It was a warm May Thursday around 7pm and the restaurant was packed. After a short wait, I was seated at the back counter, right in front of all the action (coutner where pork buns were made and kitchen cooking) - which is a great view. The waiter (super nice) said the most popular dishes are Satay are: pork buns, the satay, laksa (coconut milk soup w/ shrimp), rendang (braised beef) and the meegoreng noodles. After much debate I went with the laksa and meegoreng noodles. Note there is a mini laksa you can get for c$5.99 which is not on the menu. I'm usually not a fan of coconut but the laksa was delicious - the chilli shrimp was perfect and soup had a lot of flavor. The meegoreng noodles with shrimp and cuttlefish was perfect as well with the cuttlefish pieces being soft and tender and noodles cooked with some sauce. 

Will definitely come back to Satay Brothers."}
{"text":"Pour prendre une pause et bien manger au Marché Atwater, c'est la place où aller! De style asiatique, c'est souvent le restaurant où il y a le plus de monde au Marché Atwater. Devinez pourquoi ;). J'ai une préférence pour les buns et pulled pork, mais le choix est impressionant de mets asiatiques. Il y a aussi un bon choix de liqueurs asiatiques. Très bon service et une amie me dit souvent que les employés sont beaux."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place to try it sometime after all the good reviews I saw but I found it to be average - average food, average customer service and I also found the portions kinda small"}
{"text":"Satay brothers is a nice restaurant with warm Laksa soup. The waiter is welcoming and the location is convenient just next to Atwater market. However, I feel like the food is overall overpriced. A chicken satay cost 2.75$ each. I didn't feel fulfilled with the soup and two satays."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a bite at if you are close to Atwater. We stopped here for an early dinner and ended up using Yelp to choose items that were recommended by other Yelpers. 

We ordered Satay Chicken Skewers & Tofu Buns. Food was average. Taste was slightly bland and could use more authentic spices. Service was quick. 

With so many options for food places in every area, wouldn't necessarily recommend this spot."}
{"text":"It was okay, kind of a mixed bag. The pork buns and the meat skewers were pretty good. But the redang beef and the stir fry noodles were disappointing. The ambiance was nice though. Pretty cool decor, music was kind of loud though. We went on a Thursday night. It was near capacity but there was no wait."}
{"text":"Definitely the worst meal we had in our 3 days in Montreal. The laksa was very bland and had way too many bean sprouts (and too few noodles). The satay was also pretty boring, and had some spices that made it taste more like kebab than Satay. The rice was also super dry. The pork dish we had was the only redeemable part of the meal, but it was similar to something you could get at Panda Express. 

That being said, we probably ordered the wrong things. The table next to us ordered the mee goreng (fried noodles) and the pork buns, and they both looked pretty good."}
{"text":"L' ambiance est des plus conviviales. Le service est amical. Les petits plats à partager sont géniaux. Et tout ça à petit prix. À adopter!"}
{"text":"Menu is simple and always delicious. The staff and service are second to none. One of my favorite places to eat In Montreal."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place for dinner during our Montreal trip. My wife and I were really disappointed in the price, taste and portion ratio. We did do our research and noticed how small the portions were. The ribs entrée for $13 should really be an appetizer and lacked flavor
.
We ordered a lot food and had to wait for 2 of 5 items to come out. We were totally fatties. We shared a large table with 2 other couples. The first couple who sat down after we were seated finished and paid and we were waiting for our entrees. The second couple paid and finished their meal after we asked for our check.
 
I'm glad I tried but I would search for a more authentic place for south Asian instead of this hipster place. 

The decor and atmosphere was cool but that never gets me full.

Luckily, they accept American cc. or i would have to wash dishes and Boo Boo wax mustaches."}
{"text":"Saturday 1:30 pm, busy but not packed, waited 20 minutes and left. Thanks satay brothers, you owe me 2$ for parking."}
{"text":"This restaurant got it right! Amazing, authentic, south east Asian (mainly Singaporean) food. We had pork steam  buns, crab fritters, beef curry, chicken skewers, and salad. The owner was super friendly and made excellent recommendations. I wish the boys lots of luck! I'll be back with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Satay brothers, please move to London! I could do with eating this more often!!

We arrived at Atwater market in the late afternoon, so it should have been long after the main lunch rush...but there was still a long queue of people waiting for their satay goodness! I'm glad we joined the line as this was a truly delicious snack!

I thought I wasn't very hungry so I tried a chicken satay stick and a pork bun. They were both really good, although maybe a little small...once I tried them I felt like I could have eaten double that amount. Oops. My husband went for the satay sandwich, which was better value and turned out to be huge and gorgeous. 

My advice for future satay-munchers: Order slightly more than you think you can eat as the line is so long you won't want to go back and order all over again. Even if you're not hungry, their food is so good it will make you want to eat a little more."}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails. Perfect for sharing with groups. Steamed buns are a must try!"}
{"text":"Overall, great ambiance, not so good food. Perhaps it was because of my poor choice of plate and also the fact that I can't eat spicy. I saw the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. Took the noodles with pork and a side dish of pork bao. While the food was not mediocre, it was overpriced for what it is. My friends took the Laksa, which they told me it was kinda bland. 

While the food was not great, I could see the appeal of the restaurant with its hip and nice ambiance. It is a place where you go to chill and get food at the same time, but not a stop in itself for food according to me. Likely won't come back since it is too expensive for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Southeast Asian place that wasn't Vietnamese, so I was definitely excited to try it out! I had heard about Satay Brothers numerous times before coming, so I wanted to see whether or not it was worth the hype. The ambience was cozy and a lot bigger than what I expected when I initially walked by, and they had room to fit quite a few people. I ordered the pork buns, satay, and laksa after reading up on what to get beforehand, and all the food came out relatively quickly! The pork buns were the perfect combination of savory, rich, and fatty pork with the crispness of cucumber, bite of cilantro, and the softness of the bun. I can't remember the last time I had a bun like that; it's been so long since I've eaten homemade ones. The chicken satay skewer, although it was quite small, was juicy and went along really well with the peanut sauce that they served. The laksa came out in a bowl that was smaller than what I expected, but I thought the broth was absolutely divine and one of the few places in Montréal where something labeled as \"spicy\" is actually spicy! Unfortunately, I found the noodles to be cut quite small and there was not much seafood in the actual dish, which disappointed me. I probably counted 3 small shrimp, 2 thin slices of fish cake, and three small pieces of dried bean curd that was still crunchy in the bowl. I'm not sure if it was worth paying $9.99 for since I've had more for the same price at other places (hint hint: Nouilles de Lan Zhou), but it still tasted good! 

Overall, while I do think the food served at Satay Brothers is awesome, the portion sizes are quite small for what you pay. Perhaps it would be better to come in a group, but even then, it might burst your money bubble because getting full here certainly doesn't come cheap."}
{"text":"Best south east asian experience in montreal. Hands down impecable service, unbelievable wine list (ask for vin orange), taste is as good as it gets, i've been to singapore tasting all possible laksas and the best laksa i've ever tried is here in satay brothers."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing/reading many good things about it.  Luckily I went a bit earlier - around 11:30am - it became slammed around 12pm-ish!   Like all of a sudden a huge rush of people came in!

It's a little hidden on Notre-Dame, it's basically a red door _ I was confused for a bit until I saw someone else walk in.  Talk about sight overload - but in a good way!  Everywhere you look is a bit kitsch - but in the best way possible!  bird cages hanging from the ceiling, cool art work, the bar with cool little figurines.  Everywhere you look is something interesting to be looked at!

Since I was eating later on as well I only wanted a small bite - so I ordered their papaya salad and their steam bun with marinated tofu.   The salad was tangy and tart and fresh and spicy - a great combination of flavours!  The steam bum was delicious (there is a pork version as well but I don't eat pork so opted for the tofu version).  It was marinated well - not too salty as I find with most marinades.  It hit the spot and definitely tided me over until my next food spot.  I was impressed as well that the food came out quick and the servers came over to make sure it was to my liking.  I believe everything on the menu has a spicy kick - perfect for me! 

This is definitely a winner for me - I'll be back here for sure.  I believe there is another location - a small stall in one of the markets - Atwater market I believe).  But I don't think it can compete with the restaurant in terms of overall experience (décor, etc)."}
{"text":"Great place in st Henri but portion need to be bigger the pork buns are addicting and rest of the food was really good"}
{"text":"had chicken skewers on peanut sauce and cucumber on montreal high lights festival. on the second visit i had wonton soup. I usually hate Asian fusion but this one is really good."}
{"text":"Third time here. 
We were sorted very quickly even though the place was full. We got to sit at the bar beside the kitchen and look at the staff preparing their salads, soups and buns. 
We ordered the fried roll (shrimp, crab, calamari and pork), shrimp fried buns, meegoreng (shrimp and calamari sauté with noodles) and meat satays with peanut sauce. We also had a pitcher of Pimms cup. 
Everything was delicious. Especially the buns and fried roll. You should count about 2 plates per person. 
The pitcher was good even though I don't recall orange juice in Pimms cup. 

I definitely encourage all of you to try this place."}
{"text":"Coming from Singapore, I'd like to think that I'm quite familiar with Southeast Asian cuisine. I tried Satay Brothers looking for some authentic cuisine from back home and it did not disappoint. The menu features dishes like laksa, mee goreng, pork buns, beef rendeng, papaya salad, and you guessed it, satay.

The pork buns here are simply delicious. While they may be a turn off, due to their high price, I think they are well worth trying. The meat is tender and full of flavor, which goes perfectly with the soft bun. This is one of the better pork buns that I've had! Similarly, the satay is delicious, yet expensive. They also come in small portions. It's served with a peanut sauce, which is amazing and tastes similar to what you could get in Singapore. 

Finally, the laksa is a MUST try. It tastes truly authentic and is very delicious. It's a rich coconut based soup, with shrimp, bean sprouts, noodles and chili paste. Again, small portions. I would recommend ordering a lot to share with the group.

There are also some Asian beers available, a small selection of deserts and appetizers. The service is also really good. All the waiters are really friendly and knowledgeable about the various dishes!

Overall, Satay Brothers is delicious, but the portions are small and each dish is quite expensive. I recommend it to anyone looking for a taste of authentic Southeast Asian food. Try to order a variety of things and share!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a recent weekend in Montreal. The street was empty - closed due to construction, no one about - but inside Satay Brothers was packed with a lively crowd! The host found us a quiet(ish) table and we had a fantastic quick meal. One of the specials was a beef tomato salad which was excellent - so flavourful! Also had green papaya salad and satay (of course), and a gorgeous white wine I wish I could remember the name of. Wish I had time for a longer visit, will def be back!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my second visit to Satay Brothers. The service and atmosphere are great, especially the music. I enjoyed the food during my first visit with a large group and was excited to come back. Unfortunately my second visit was disappointing as the flavours of the food we ordered were very bland.

We ordered the otak-otak, char kuay teow, as well as the satay. While the otak-otak itself was alright, the coconut rice that accompanied it lacked the flavour and fragrance of coconut. Sadly the char kuay teow also lacked some seasoning and spiciness. Additionally, it would have been nice to have some chilli paste and lime on the side. Lastly, the satay edges weren't as crispy or caramelized as I'd hoped for. I did enjoy the peanut sauce that came with the satay. 

I so badly want to love this place as it can be difficult to find easily accessible Singaporean/Malaysian food in Canada. I doubt I'll be coming back any time soon unless the flavours and spices are ramped up."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, I finally got the chance to see for myself what the hype was all about. Initially, I actually walked right passed this restaurant because there was no sign but you could tell you were at the right place because of the crowd inside. When I first walked in , I was immediately drawn to the decor. I loved the bright red walls and the endless collection of Asian decorations at every corner of the restaurant. It reminded me of my grandparents' home with the thrift finds and traditional artwork so be prepared for a strong embrace of nostalgia. I arrived around 7 on a Sunday night and the place was packed (it was a long weekend so probably equivalent to a Saturday). It does get quite loud so not a place for catching up and deep heart to heart conversations. It has that young and trendy vibe as most of the customers seemed to be in their 20s and 30s and most of their waiters were young guys-just an observation. Be prepared to share tables with strangers since they have a few big round tables and of course lots of customers. Now back to the food... I highly recommend the cerviche which is a raw fish salad on their special menu. It has the perfect blend of flavours and acidity. The fried rice and laksa were also pretty good. Don't be intimidated by the chili paste in the laska, it really isn't that spicy. Definitely order the pork buns and chicken skewers for appetizers. The dishes may look quite simple but the real skill lies in their ability to create unique flavours from different combinations of spices. If you're looking for a fun place to eat and something different for your palette then definitely check out Satay Brothers!"}
{"text":"The place is very busy even on a weekday, the food was great and tasty.  We met up with Alex the owner of the restaurant.  He is the reason why the restaurant so successful. Very outgoing guy, smart, very driven, ambitious, and they even had another restaurant open at the market.  Come on by and see what the hype all about...."}
{"text":"GO HERE AND GET THE PORK BUNS. The awful looking line isn't as bad as it looks. The staff is friendly, considering they're the busiest people in the entire world. The prices are impressively low. The satay skewers blew my tits apart. An easy-ish walk from the metro. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for pork
buns and i've tried them all even from the best restaurants in NYC and Satay's buns are the best.  Laksa is delicious as well and their papaya salad.  The rest of the menu is average."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not much on the menu. Uncomfortable seats if your sitting on the stools. Very loud could hardly hear from across the table. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great prices and friendly service.

It does get very busy and it's the only restaurant with dedicated queue at Atwater market.

The ice tea is also excellent, homemade as it should be.

Really worth it"}
{"text":"I'd heard about Satay Brothers from a couple of friends. Happened to be at Atwater Market for a meeting and had some time to kill, plus was STARVING so stepped in line to see what the buzz was all about. (Note: this was probably the most popular stall in the entire place!) The gado gado salad was very, VERY fresh and delicious. Meat satay stick (pork) was tough and chewy. Staff was pretty much all male and quite rambunctious...not my style, but it's an outdoor market so to be expected I suppose. Communal bench table seating."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! My husband and I went to Satay brothers today on Father's Day for a quick snack with our little baby. It was my first time at this particular market as well as our first try at this satay Brothers.

I first ordered only one satay skewer and one pork bun with a burbon lemonade. The guy who took our order was especially cool and friendly and with all the folks lining up to get a taste - it was definitely an indication that this was going to be good! Well, it was more than good it was EPIC FLAVORS!!!! So much so that we went back and re-ordered more buns and skewers and a satay sandwich: all was amazing. One is NoT enough; trust me!!!

When I say this was delicious it's truly an understatement. This spot is being book marked and we WILL BE back!!!! One of the best parts is the service, hands down a great group of people running this joint! Thanks for the extra Father's Day lemonade thrown in for my husband, we really appreciate it :-D"}
{"text":"I brought my Malaysian/Singaporean parents to check out Satay Brothers, their first observation, no Malaysian/Singaporean cooking satays? Nope, just a bunch of Caucasian boys. We ordered; the buns, the Laksa, green papaya salad, chicken satays. The verdict from my parents: 2 thumbs up! They even went back for seconds, the guy was nice enough to let me parents try the Pandan sticky rice complimentary. I looove Pandan, so it was a winner for me! My parents has lived in Quebec for 30 years and now they can get a little taste of home. C'est beau les boys!"}
{"text":"was traveling to montreal with some buddies for a weekend get together. Founds this place next to our air bnb by luck. walked in, ordered down the entire special menu and man the food was bomb (esp that lobster noodle and laksa). our guy Mark from Satay had impeccable service attitude (hooked us up with extra fried buns and soup because we had a lot of guys sharing) without needing us to ask. It's not like one of those \"oh how's everything\" every 2 seconds type service but more like I think you guys need this and so I got it for you. they thought about every little detail to make our experience awesome. even chatted up a bunch with one of the bros about Oscar Peterson for a while. absolutely a great meal experience."}
{"text":"Amazing laksa soup
Fabulous papaya salad 
Delicious GF desserts
Very flavourful and unique
Great ambience & music at resto which has an awesome vibe and authentic decor"}
{"text":"Food is so good here.  pork bun, rib, fried rice,.satay chicken, coconut noodle, and papaya salad!! soo yummy!! service is so good too!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is average at best. Not sure what the hype is all about to be honest....I mean food tasted okay, service was average, and the restaurant itself is super corny with random Asian decorations to make it more \"Asian\" haha....

Pork buns - Eh. I've definitely had better pork buns. Buns were not that good and pork needs to be more meaty and fatty and less salty.
 
Laksa - Flavor is there but the texture was too watery...real laksa needs to be more thick in terms of texture and flavor needs to be more deep which can only be created with the right amount of ingredients AND A LOT OF TIME BOILING.

Pork fried rice - honestly I couldn't find anything else worth trying on the menu so I just opted for the fried rice. Tasted okay but it was too greasy...I can probably make better fried rice than they do here.

Overall, I think we got caught up in the hype and had our expectations way too high. I mean if you are nearby I guess you can give it a try but if you are a little far out, don't go out of your way to eat here. Not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The service is exemplary. Made me feel like I've been going there for years and it was my first time. From the cashier to the bartenders, everyone was extremely nice. Sangria was delicious and strong! We had a couple satay that were perfectly seasoned (meat). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My 3 Star rating is strictly for their food. Their customer service is 5 Stars. This little place was recommended to us by a friend. She said that it was a \"MUST GO\" when in Montreal. We arrived on a dimly lit street and the restaurant had no business sign, so just look for a place that kinda emits red lights. We go there around 5:45pm on a Sunday and the place was already packed. We tried calling in advance for reservations, however, they said that they didn't do reservations on weekends. Yet, when we walked in, there was a 20 person table with a \"reserved\" sign on it. Oh well, moving on. We were offered the only table left in the restaurant in a very dim lighted area or be seated at communal tables. As a foodie, I enjoy my personal space and my lighted areas for savoury food pictures. Nonetheless, we chose the single table with dim lighting. Their menu was very simple, not a lot to choose from. So we ordered the following: 

- Chicken Skewers (3) $7.00
- Laksa $10.50
- Honey ribs $13.00
- Meegoreng $13.00

First off, the waiters were very helpful. They explained the dishes, told us whether we over ordered or whether it was too much food. They told us which of their dishes are the most popular and which ones are spicy or not. 

The Chicken Skewers came first and they were heavenly. You can tell that the peanut sauce was made in house and not from a bottle. The skewers were juicy and tender. 

The Laksa was delicious. However, it's supposed to come with noodles. The amount of noodles in that bowl was very disappointing. I'm pretty sure i could have counted the strands of noodles and not run out of breath. They substituted a majority of the noodles for bean sprouts which was unappetizing. The soup itself was delicious. 

Honey Ribs were disappointing. 6 or 7 pieces of small ribs for 13 dollars was NOT worth it. The ribs were also cooked very weird. They tasted like they were made with a mixture of soy sauce and honey/sugar. But, this was a dish I would not recommend. 

Meegoreng is a stir fry dish made with fat noodles, onions, peppers, bean sprouts and protein. Again, i was able to count the strands of fat noodles in this dish as well. There was probably three whole onions chopped up to substitute the noodles in this dish. Flavour? it wasn't that great. There was an overpowering spicy taste that took away from the rest of the dish. 

As we were eating the place got packed and due to a lack of restaurant lobby space, there were people waiting right beside us as we ate. 

Overall, Customer service was phenomenal. Food Quality was OK. Prices? over priced. 

You can definitely find some place with better quality + prices for Singaporean/Malaysian food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Malaysian food! That Laska was one of the best bowls of soup we have ever had! Not to be missed. It was PACKED full of flavor with just the right amount of kick. They can and will eliminate items for dietary reasons. That and a local IPA on tap was a perfect treat for hubs and I to share on a rainy, romantic autumn day. 

They also offer buns and satay (obviously) of all kinds, even tempeh for a veg friendly option and of course papaya salads. It all looked delicious. 

The guys were so friendly and we joked around with them. Cool dudes. 

We enjoyed sitting casually on the picnic tables right there after shopping the market.  

I think we lucked out as we came just before closing on a Saturday. There was no line at all!

Cash only."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I've gone to their pop-up restaurant in the Atwater market many times and I've always been impressed with the food and service. Their new location on Notre-Dame is even better. The food is the same great quality and they have even more items and drinks on the menu! My favorite is the satay and papaya salad but the buns and laksa lemak are definitely worth a try. 

The decor and ambiance of the new space is really fresh and I can imagine it would be a great place to grab a drink later in the evening."}
{"text":"This location is outdoors and closes during the winter, but now you can find them even when it's cold out, indoors at their newly renovated 20 seat resto in St Henri!! http://www.yelp.ca/biz/satay-brothers-winter-location-montreal"}
{"text":"Where to get your Satay Brothers fix during the Winter! With Creemore beer on tap, and open till 10pm starting Feb7th (ish ;) 

All the delicious reviews over on the Biz listing for the Satay Brothers stand in the market apply, just add indoors and cozy: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/satay-brothers-montreal"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a bite at the Atwater market! The people behind the counter are always fun to talk to and service is always with a smile. There is usually a line up but worth the wait. 
Had the tofu buns with niki papaya salad witch was incredible. The chilies pack punch so if u can't take the heat move them aside."}
{"text":"The menu is short. But all seven orders we had were delicious. The line is long. But really worth the wait. The boys are all tattooed. But they are really nice and cool and real and cook good food. Going back again is a sure thing."}
{"text":"Très très bon. Tous nos choix de plats étaient délicieux. L'ambiance chaleureuse, les couleurs sont vives. Les photos nous on fait rigoler. Le resto est bondé, c'est rassurant de le voir à la première visite. Attente pas très longue, même pas 10. Hâte  d'y retourner."}
{"text":"Came here after reading some really good comments. 
Even thought the lineup was really long, the table turnover rate was quite high and we(4) got a table really fast. 
We basically ordered everything one of everything, pork bun, Papaya salad, short ribs, beef curry, laksa and chicken skewer. 
Everything was heavily seasoned, don't expect to have some natural flavour in there. 
Very small portion sizes though. 
The service was good until we asked for the bill. The guy wasn't happy that we wanted to split the bill (there were 4of us). When he punched in the amount for the first person, he entered $1 more than what's on the bill. When we pointed that out, he had a really bad attitude, asked \"what do you want, it's just $1\" and didn't even apologize. That was extremely disrespectful and such a bad ending to our meal."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Satay Brothers. I love the laksa, I love the buns, I love the satay and I love the decor. If you want it real spicy, just ask for more hot sauce. Seriously though, best laksa in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"Okay so after a long wait, I finally tried this place and it's so refreshing for the rumours to be right - the food here is fantastic. We tried the Beef Rendang, Laksa Lemak (with chicken), and the Papaya salad... Everything was tasty and of great quality.. the braised beef in the Rendang melted in our mouths, the server said it's braised for something like 16 hours (I don't remember the exact number, but in this ballpark range). I don't normally order salads when I go out, but the papaya salad was tasty, spicy and refreshing, and the laksa was very good - not as spicy as I was expecting but we asked for more chill paste, and they happily brought us a generous amount. Also the restaurant decor was really fun, and definitely worth noting - the bathroom was impeccably clean! (I always check out the washrooms at restaurants because the cleanliness of the washroom suggests the cleanliness of the kitchen). I'll definitely be bringing friends back to this place."}
{"text":"Fun and easy! Nice menu, good price, chill service. Loved the bao and salade de papaye."}
{"text":"We order laksa and satay chicken there and they taste so delicious! Staff are nice and friendly! Now i know why it called Satay Brothers! All of the staff and chef are handsome and young"}
{"text":"Quelle belle découverte dans St-Henri (ou les environs)! L'endroit est assez caché et discret, alors regardez les adresses comme il faut ! Une fois à l'intérieur, l'ambiance à elle seule vous fera aimer la place !! Asseyez-vous au bar si vous voulez voir comment ils font les plats ! Comme c'est sous forme tapas, je vous conseille 4-5 plats pour deux ! Ne passez pas à côtés des Bao au porc (oh my god c'est tellement bon, on pourrait dire que c'est la bouffe des dieux) ! Pis en plus, le prix est super abordable !!"}
{"text":"Can you believe I've never stepped foot into Atwater Market? Well, nestled away in one of the stalls is a super popular Indonesian/Malaysian/Singaporean spot, Satay Brothers. They've become so popular that they have an actual restaurant in St. Henri (about a 5 minute walk away) that's open for dinner when the market shuts down.

Hours coincide with the market although they're closed Monday and Tuesday. First time I came, they were closed but that just meant I could take pictures in peace. Drink menu - interesting that you can order pitchers. Perfect for summer drinking. Even though they have a paper menu, the board menu reflects actual prices.

The stall is very laid back and the guys working there are very cool. We sat at the two counter seats on the side and got to chat with some of the workers, which was pretty entertaining. Even when they were shutting things down to move to the restaurant, they didn't rush us. Heck, they gave us some chicken satay skewers on the house.

- Calamansi lemonade ($3.50)
- Green papaya salad ($8.00)
- Laksa lemak ($11.50)
- Chicken satay skewers

I can't really think of any other places in town that specialize in south-east Asian cuisine so you'll have to make due with Satay Brothers to get your fix. Not a bad way to end my trip!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I am giving this place 1*.. I really really was excited and looking forward to dining here!
 
It was a complete an utter disappointment especially since the expectations were high and it all came crashing down starting by the seating itself!

They seat you with strangers so we were like 7 people (I, my boyfriend and my mother - a couple presumably on a date - a pair of friends catching up chatting away non-stop).  I really don't like eavesdropping other's conversations or intrude on someone's date. All three of us had our heads down throughout.. 
Servers are not too attentive and based on the ambiance, it honestly felt like I was crashing someone's party and shoved to a side.. 
Then I had hoped that the food might compensate for this awkward discovery.. But it was the worst!!!!!
 Laksa was okay but became cold soon. Everything was served at the same time irrespective of it being an appetizer/main.. 
the chicken curry was full of bones and barely any meat.. We were essentially having the gravy with rice.
 The noodles with sausages and seafood smelt really really bad.. Reminded me (very unfortunately and I hate to have made this immediate comparison) of cow dungs... Very repulsive..
 I had called earlier to check if they had some vegetarian options since my mom's one. They lady on the phone assured me with full confidence that they do have many.. So I was really excited but all my mom could eat was fried tofu. The broths of vegetable dishes contained fish sauce so our options were like 2 for her.. And one of those contained an egg with a runny yolk... 


I hope no body has this kind of experience, ever!! Really disappointed :'("}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to eat at the Satay Brothers last night and it somehow surpassed the extremely high expectations I had! I was part of a large group of 9 friends but the wait for a table was worth it. Very friendly and welcoming staff - felt like I've been going there for years. Ate a satay, pork bun and laksa lemak. Drank a caesar and Beerlao. Left satisfied and excited I found a new fav restaurant."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to coming here after reading numerous reviews. Singaporean/Indonesian/Malay is a great meal when I can find a restaurant that serves it in it's fragrant, flavourful and spicy manner. Here at Satay Brothers the vibe is low key. It's basically a summer food court whereby you eat at communal picnic tables. I'm cool with that as it's summer and your eating under a tent and there's are scents of food in the air. Very laid back. 

For lunch I had ordered the laksa, 3 satay sticks and a papaya salad. I was really looking forward to a great meal but was seriously underwhelmed. The laksa although looked great was lacking in some flavour. The chicken satay although you could taste was marinated in coconut milk the peanut sauce was bland. The papaya salad was probably the best out of everything but again Paris Pho does a better version. As others have mentioned portions here are a tad on the smaller size. The 3 satay sticks are seriously a joke as they are some of the smallest satay skewers I've ever seen. For me overall the food was a 2.75 stars. They could use a bit of galangal, ginger, lemongrass and Thai birdseye chilies to give it more flavour. I respect however that this is their gameplan and I'm a mere observer. 

If you have the opportunity and want to check out what I consider top notch Malaysian/Indonesian food to check out is Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill. Or one of the many Banana Leaf restaurants in Vancouver. In Montreal however there is not a huge amount of Indo/Malay restaurants so they can get away with smaller portions and charging a bit more. My next place I need to check out is Gado Gado. Overall it's okay I was just expecting so so much more!"}
{"text":"Unreal laksa. I grew up in Australia, and have had my share of awesome Malaysian cuisine. This was completely on par with what I love, and the customer service was brilliant. Quick, friendly, and very very impressive. It's such a simple thing, but asking your customer's name in a familiarizing way and then repeating it back to them is a huge deal and makes you want to come back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes me feel lucky to live in Montreal. I can't count the number of times I've been there and I usually don't like going back to restaurants since there are so many ones to try. 

The food is authentic and spicy so watch out if you can't handle heat. My favorite dishes to order are the tofu bun, the soup laksa (don't skip this one!) and the mee koreng. You know a place is good when you instantly start craving it again as soon as you walk out.      
 
The ambiance and decor are very nice - it's perfect if you're in a group because it tends to get loud. If you haven't been yet, you are really missing out!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, awesome oriental atmosphere, the food is tasty. The praises are very reasonable. A dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine is under $100"}
{"text":"Yummy. Delicious. Tasty. A bit pricey considering its comfort food but will definitively go back again and again"}
{"text":"Incredible food, very authentic and flavorful, and the service was great! And the dessert was absolutely incredible, highly recommend the three combo. Just absolutely great in atmosphere, service, and food. 100% would recommend."}
{"text":"Walked in here and immediately knew this place would be awesome. A gentleman named Phil gave us some great suggestions and nailed every single one ! Love this place , definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"'Un bon souper entre amis qui va finir tard !' 
Lorsqu'on va chez Satay Brothers, on y est reçu comme des amis, sans prétention. On mange chez son voisin, le genre jeune et un peu fou ! 

L'ambiance est ce qu'il y a de mieux. C'est toujours le coeur à la fête. Pour un souper de fête/retrouvaille/une soirée entre amis c'est l'endroit parfait. 

Le service est sympathique, quoique peu attentif. 
Mais lorsqu'on demande on obtient, et le tout est très rapide. 

Le menu était très varié et les portions sont généreuses. Certains plats manquaient d'épices ou étaient beaucoup trop salés, mais généralement ça allait. Ce n'est pas de la grande table, c'est plutôt dela bouffe qualité lunch. C'est correct et sans prétention, mais rien d'exceptionnel. 

On y retourne surtout pour le plaisir d'une belle soirée garantie."}
{"text":"Amazing food; great bar and service. Fun crowd and atmosphere. Everything we ate was fantastic."}
{"text":"We had the privilege of being their first customers of the 2017 season. We got beer and chicken sticks and it was exceptional! Also amazing staff!! Wish we could come back."}
{"text":"It's a very cold Canadian spring day and I'm grabbing a lunch at the Satay Brothers, but no, wait, it is actually summer, I'm back at their Atwater market stand, eating the same wonderful food, feeling relaxed and happy. This is how the new, permanent I hope, Satay Brothers location made me feel today, it brought me in the warm months. The new restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating options, including two bars. Atmosphere is laid back. Drinks menu has grown to unexpected heights, cocktails, wines etc. The guys working there seem to be the same cheerful folks from the market and they are doing nice job to satisfy the customers. 

The food is of the same quality as what you would find at the Atwater market stand, I like consistency. Chicken satay and spicy papaya salad are my favourite dishes, but suddenly I realized how perfect is to have the Laksa Lemak soup today, hot and spicy, warming up. The pork buns are still the same, puffy and delicious. Some of the dishes are available only during the evening, but this made my choice easier, just stick to what you love! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"La bouffe est toujours magnifique. La meilleure salade de papaye en ville. Les buns sont ultra cochons. Le staff toujours souriant. Les prix parfaits. Ils ont même une excellente IPA. Dans mon top 3 resto a YUL."}
{"text":"Je suis aller la bas après un vernissage, avec des artistes et mon boss, nous étions une petite table de cinq, vu que nous sommes arrivé avant 19h30. Les serveurs sont super efficaces et souriants, ils ont su nous conseiller selon nos préférence à chacun. J'ai pris le sandwich au tofu avec les légumes du jours et c'était délicieux, les portions était parfait, le tofu super bien assaisonné, j'ai également pu gouté aux beignet végétarien, délicieux également. Arrivé 20h la place était pack donc je conseille vraiment d'arriver avant."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal for the first time. I got craving for THAI papaya salad for some reasons, and went to Satay Brothers to try out based on reviews from Yelp! Honestly, it was not that good. The papaya salad was too sour and the kebab was burnt. I also got laksa, which tasted just fine and the green pandan/sticky rice was not as expected, quite chalky (if it even makes sense^_^). It was nice experience though because the store is located in the Marche Atwater. It was quite pricey and the line was quite long. Worth trying for the experience though"}
{"text":"Beef sandwich was really really tasty, go here for food for sure if you're at the Marche Atwater. Nice servers as well."}
{"text":"First time here. It was buzzing w people 20-30 year olds. Probably one of the liveliest eats on this street. 

-vegetable bowl w addition of pork belly- good spicy sauce with veggies, potato and tofu to ease the spice
-1 chicken wing- tasty and tender
-pandan custard on top of sticky rice- I love both of those things so even so when combined. The sticky rice did seem a little hard."}
{"text":"So this restaurant was packed when we got there on a Saturday night. The area was kinda sketch to walk fr the Lionel-Groulx station, so I would recommend walking in a big group or even driving/ubering to the restaurant. 

From the outside, it doesn't look like much but once you take a look inside...you see what the hype is about. The food smells amazing. There's quite a line so maybe call ahead or come early. The line was long that afternoon (late afternoon) so my friend and I decided to just get some pork buns (togo) to hold our stomach. Amazing guys! 

I was conversating with some locals in line and apparently this place is bomb. I was scared that it was a tourist trap but it is def not. 

I def can't wait to come back to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Had to stop by this place based on reviews. It did not disappoint. I'm glad i did. 

We ordered char kwetiao, laksa, buns and mee goreng. 

All foods were excellent. Being familiar with singaporean food, the taste is close to being authentic. 

Alex our server was amazing. He and his brother took the time to make us a special order of nasi goreng.  

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Laksa Lemak soup is my newest Montreal culinary craving. The asian lanterns and baseball caps are a nice ambient touch."}
{"text":"Came to Satay brorhers Atwater market before   closing for winter season , beautiful day to eat outside. We had satays of course... papaya salad and pork bun. The satays were very good!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Satay Brothers in the market, and it was amazing. The pork buns were definitely the highlight of the experience.  We also tried the papaya salad and curry soup, both were awesome.  The servers were also really nice and made good recommendations."}
{"text":"I love the brothers. Some of the most delicious food in Montreal from the satay sandwich to the pork buns to the laksa. Plus check out the specials such as Mee Rebus."}
{"text":"I can see the hype. Exotic food, hipster feel. 
However, the flavours I find are not quite as well developed/complex than in truly authentic cambodian/thai/viet place. 

Singaporean food is a mix of all these cuisines, and this place is successful in the way it communicates these cuisines to the mainstream. 

However, if you have tried authentic southeast asian restaurants, you will notice that it lacked to deliver on the flavour side.

This place is a luxury thai express."}
{"text":"These guys have been perfecting their craft at the Atwater markets (during the Summer) for the last few years. What you get here is more of the good stuff. The food is great, and the prices are cheap!

The laksa is solid, the satay sandwiches are great (how could they not be?), and the pork buns - while not looking like what I'm used to - are great!

I love that they have Creemore Springs by the pint - it goes so well with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"The Brothers are rocking this place.   I was a regular at Atwater, and Singapore is my second home.   I had high expectations for this place and it exceeded them.   All the authentic items from the market stall are still there, but now the menu has expanded out to 20+ items.   I was amazed.  Everything I had was solid.   The Satay took me back to Boon Tang Street at La Pau Sat Hawker Centre.   This is the real deal..

The service was excellent, the new restaurant looked great, and had a great youthful feel.    

Really a great experience."}
{"text":"Tried out this place with my cousin. Very warm ambience, great staff very friendly.
We ordered the green papaya salad, it came fairly quickly. Some great spice but very bright and acidic.Then we took an order of tofu buns and pork buns..DELICIOUS.

We each took a Laska soup. Great dish, right amount of heat and subtle coconut/lime flavour. The shrimp were also cooked perfectly.

Overall our experience was great. Would definitely go back and explore the menu."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Nice vibe and atmosphere
- Quick service
- Tasty and unique food for the area
- Great sharables

Cons:
- Wish the portions were a little bigger
- Super small lobby to wait in

Ordered:
$6.99 Chicken Satay - The peanut sauce is killer
$6.99 Papaya salad - Nicely tart and spicy
$11.99 Meegorang - Pretty good. Wish the portion was larger
$4.50 Keuh Salat - Super yummy

Conclusion:
This is my second time at this place. Satay Brothers is a great place to eat, drink and have a good time with friends. The atmosphere there is fun and lively and the food is always good. It's usually busy during dinner time which is a good sign that it's a spot around the area. Food tasted great and prices are reasonable. We didn't wait very long for food to arrive and service was quick. No real negatives about this place. I really enjoyed myself the two times I came and would gladly come back next time I'm in town! Would highly recommend this resto"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend and got seated at the bar back by the kitchen. It was fun to eat and hangout with the staff for the night. The pork buns were amazing. They were made right in front of us, the bun, sauce, pork and toppings were a perfect combo. Then we had our entrees- I had the veggie bowl with pork (really good and filling) and my friend had the beef brisket. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for $20. The place was filled with people for the entire night, and service was excellent from beginning to the end. Thanks Phil, Web, Magic and everyone for a great night and great food! Will be back for sure when I visit Montreal again. Too bad there isn't a location in the Toronto area!"}
{"text":"You know a place is good when, they barely have any signage in front of the building and it still draws a long line on weekday. I was just visiting Montreal for the week, but read the reviews online and had to check it out.

If you ask me, the soup is the star of the show, with pork buns a close second. I don't think the soup would be technically be considered pho, but the comparison is inevitable. They have couple different varieties of my meats and flavors, so you should be able to find something that works for you. I've only tried shrimp/chili variety and I was not disappointed. The soup even included a nice cheese (munster?) to give the dish a touch more \"fusion\". The pork buns are also great - nicely marinated and not too fatty. Finally, the sandwich and papaya salad are also worth a try.  Furthermore, the other patrons  I talked to were actually Montreal natives, and confirmed it was one of their favorite asian fusion spot in the city. If your in MTL and like southeast asian food, this place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been here and at their restaurant many times and was satisfied everytime. The food is always delicious. The service is always good, I really enjoy their energy. Definitely a good spot for some spicy and comfort food!"}
{"text":"The line-up is worth it. Trust me! Perfect spot for a quick and light lunch after biking on the Canal or before running some errands at the market. The steamed pork buns are amazing. We also tried the satay sandwich which was sweet and savory and a fresh salad. The servings are small so perfect for snacking, or take a few if you're super hungry!"}
{"text":"Last night, we ventured out from downtown to St. Henri to check out the Satay Brothers' permanent location. 

Food: We split a papaya salad, 2 steamed buns with pork belly, marinated meat sticks and each got the shrimp laksa 
Overall everything hit the spot in terms of authentic Singaporean flavours. The steamed pork buns were the real highlight - Super fresh and that mix of super soft buns, salty pork and crisp coriander is just unbeatable. The meat sticks were tender and flavourful; The peanut sauce on the side is to die for. The laksa was really comforting and definitely a bit spicier than expected. The only slight disappointment was the papaya salad. The dressing was a bit heavy on the lime juice and the nuts were not as crunchy as they could have been. 
We didn't order their special that night (Fish cakes with rice) but it sounded delicious. Next time I'm planning on trying the beef rendang and the short ribs. 

Service: Very cool, trendy and friendly servers. They are quick and efficient, working well with the go-go-go vibes of the restaurant as a whole. 

Decor: Everything from the order chits, the china-patterned plates and bamboo steamers are very modern-traditional. The family style tables are not too crammed. I'd love to sit closer to the kitchen in the back next time! I'd make a serious effort to arrive before 6pm if you don't want to wait too long in line!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed but didn't have to wait since we arrived before 7 pm. They don't take reservations so be there early if you're a group! The food is tasty, fresh and service is quick! We were 5 people and ordered one of each dishes. Definitely loved the lamb korma, buns the most but everything was great! The staff is super friendly and amazing atmosphere :) would recommend strongly!"}
{"text":"Always a fun time! Sometimes you're seated at a table with other parties. But I like that! It's always packed to the seams and for good reason. Food is so well priced, consistently great food! Loved every dish I ever tried. The papaya salad, Shirataki mushroom noodles and the spicy laksa are my personal faves! Always expect great service and good eats."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place, the line was ok when we got there, only waited for 10-15min. The food was good but nothing amazing. I would go back but avoid the weekend line"}
{"text":"Despite the lines and the crowds, every facet of the Satay Bros experience is phenomenal. The host was on point, and took out drink order while we waited. 

When we were seated, it was the perfect table, a window seat away from the distractions. Within minutes we had a menu that didn't try to overcomplicate things: one page with pictures and descriptions. 

We ordered the papaya salad with pork, the satays (obviously) and some insanely delicious spicy beef dish. Every bite was perfection. 

Honestly, there was not a single thing wrong about the experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had one of the most fun meals of my life, if not THE most fun meal of my life there. My mom is Indo-Chinese, and she would approve of the food, but it was the service, the vibe of the restaurant, and the great people they have working there that made it such an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Endroit sympa et décoration chouette, par contre un peu bruyant à mon goût. Les plats sont correctes sans prétention."}
{"text":"Last week my boyfriend and I were on the lookout for something new and exciting, and saw that Satay Brothers had 5 stars and decided to go for it!  At first we were a little worried considering the area around it is quite dark, so we thought we might have been duped and the place closed.  Luckily we were wrong! 

It's a tiny little place with elbow-to-elbow seating, but it is definitely worth it.  The food is absolutely amazing.  At first we were a little unsure what to go with since we really hadn't had anything on the menu before, but the employees were so welcoming and happy to explain it all to us.  The service is really what made the experience that much better.  We split the Mee Goreng (I'm sorry about the spelling!) and the dish of the day which had all kinds of stuff in it... all you need to know is that it was all delicious.  We would have tried one of everything (and almost did!) if we had more room in our stomachs!

I can't wait to head back to Montreal again just to come back here :)"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good stuff. Probably best hot food in the Atwater market. The dudes there were edgy, which was offsettling and intriguing. I don't want to encourage it, but whatever. Keep it up fellas."}
{"text":"Being sick isn't fun, no appetite, frustrated.. You get it. 
Not sure what to eat and decided to go with strong flavoured satay food and oh boy... I made a great choice :) 

The place is always packed with people, great vibe, the atmosphere is fun and youth. 

The food, you must try their satayyyyyyyyy skewers! Freshly made papaya salad, authentic laksa noodle soup. I also ordered a fried rice noodles, it has strong flavour, it helps when you're sick :P. 

It's great to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and I guess everyone does too because there's always a lineup to get in! The people who work there are super friendly and the food is delicious!! I usually get the laksa soup, the gado gado and the pork buns. Last time I went I tried the deep fried crab bun and damn it was fabulous!The wait can be pretty long since they do not take reservations  but you can drink while you wait ;) Also they never kick us out even though it's almost or past closing which I greatly appreciate!"}
{"text":"Super resto, à la hauteur de sa réputation, les buns au porc(c'est de la bombe),la soupe laksa excellente. La place était bondé un dimanche à 1700 ça veut tout dire. 9.5/10meilleur place de st henri"}
{"text":"Somehow I liked this place. It is not a fancy dinner place, I had their tofu steamed buns which had a mix of flavour and it was really delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a fan! We ordered the satay, steamed buns, lamb sandwich of the day, papaya salad and the laksa - then we ordered another lamb sandwich because it was THAT good. The desserts were okay - not too sweet but we were really too full to appreciate them. The service was great - I really like it when you ask your waiter for a recommendation and without hesitation and with a lot of confidence can give you a quick answer. The staff is really on the ball!

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the laksa was just OK (not the best, not the worst) and the ambiance was a bit crazy. Forget having a long dinner in this place. We were seated with a bunch of people we didn't know (which is fine) but we couldn't converse because it was quiet a loud bunch opposite us. We ordered our food all at once and it was all on the table within 5 minutes. I would have liked the food to come out with a bit more space between plates. We ate really fast because that was just the pace of the place. FAST!"}
{"text":"Simply the best in town!  Heck, probably best in eastern Canada!

We came for dinner last night and were blown away by the atmosphere, food and service!

So we inquired if they knew what Hainanese Chicken was and they said of course, but it had to be a special request as it is not on their menu.

We said sign us up!

We are now back for lunch and with very high expectations.   All expectations were met and surpassed.   We are happy campers right now!  Look at this picture!

Magic is the man, he not only set us up with a fantastic meal, he brought us this amazing crepe dessert called 'Kueh Da Da'.   

Made our entire trip, this meal is not soon forgotten!"}
{"text":"Been there on multiple occasions and never disappointed. The prices may be a bit high but the quality of the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to have a quick but delicious dinner. Dishes are simple but very tasty. I recommend the pork buns, the papaya salad. Friendly staff, good place for dinner with friends or just with your partner if you dont mind sitting at same table than other people. Ratio quality and price is very good as well. Dont hesitate to give it a try"}
{"text":"Les Satay brothers sont situés à l'entrée du Marché Atwater. Nombreux plats à savourer ici, j'ai adoré mes brochettes/concombres + eau de coco, délicieux ! Par contre, il faut au moins prendre 2 plats car un seul ne suffit pas. Soyez prêt à attendre en ligne car c'est devenu une place populaire."}
{"text":"Jeudi soir 20h, restaurant rempli à craquer, premier arrivé, premier servi, pas de réservations. Le serveur était sympa et nous a trouver une place au comptoir de la cuisine après 15 minutes d'attente. Coup de coeur pour les buns au porc, délicieux & fondants dans la bouche, la salade de papaye & les nouilles aux fruits de mer étaient bonnes, les 3 brochettes de viande grillées étaient corrects, le tout avec une bière Tsing Tao pour bien descendre. Bon service. Prix abordables. Par contre, très bruyant comme ambiance. Bonne expérience culinaire à Montréal pour la bouffe singapourienne/malaisienne, presque comme à Singapour ou Kuala Lumpur pour les non initiés.

4/5 visité en août 2015."}
{"text":"MUST TRY: VAPOUR BUN & SATAY! Always very popular at lunch time and even much later (around 3PM there's still a 20 minutes lineup), come prepared with cash! Their braised pork steamed buns are served in an Asian style steaming bamboo container and chicken satay placed on traditional motif plates, which enhances visually the whole eating experience!"}
{"text":"A nice Asian/fusion resto-bar. The buns are so fresh and so good! The soup is a little bit salty and spicy. But it's a nice way to warm up in old winter. The service is good. But it's too noisy inside. Sometime it's hard to talk to friends."}
{"text":"Setting the bar pretty high for good food in general. The Laksa Lemak is crazy good! Great staff, very helpful. 

Try a sandwich! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Our celebration night was a disaster, we arrived at 7:30 and weren't served by 9:30
Service was terrible no one apologized mgmt didn't care if we were upset
Not coming back"}
{"text":"Why is is that stall vendors and street food vendors make the best food ever ? By that I mean, it is uncomplicated, inexpensive, delicious and delightful and owners and servers are always cheerful, helpful and just downright awesome.

I confess...I am not a Montrealais, which does not mean that by nature I do not enjoy food. In fact of the matter is I like to graze...kind like a vache Quebecoise! 

Satay Brothers is another little place, dear in my heart now that I've discovered it ...and shamefully so because I do not live the cosmopolitan and incroyable city of Montreal year around...but just visit and return year after year as it is becoming my favourite destination in North America.

Let me cut to the chase...stand in line...just be patient and you will be rewarded with some of the finest southeast asian specialties like satay skewers...there is also a satay of the day...like Pork or chicken, whichever..there is also a fabulous entree soup called Laksa Lemak, spiced to your liking...my friend Michelle got ten spoons of sambal in hers but she is crazily adventurous and likes her mouth to be set on fire.

There are also delightful little steamed buns, with various fillings...the day I visited was pork. In addition there are a handful of deserts but just as a heads up, they sell out quickly...and last but not least there is the popular fresh papaya salad.

So when in the Atwater market area, try something new and support local merchants and these delightful people (owners are brothers Alex and Mat).
The line is less long in early afternoon like 2 pm however, they are more likely to have run out of some of their dishes by then. They are very swift with some dishes while others take a little longer and patience it shall be rewarded :) FYI, they are closed on 
Tuesday and Wednesday for well deserved days off. A bientot chers Amis, your friend, Antoine."}
{"text":"I went for a soup with my friend today. The quality of the ingredients is excellent and the soup was coconut and curry based. They made it extra spicy upon request! The service was excellent ! I recommend for good food and joyful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"À découvrir ou redecouvrir pour ceux qui ont déjà été au Satay Brothers du marché Atwater! Super Ambiance avec musique hip hop 90's! Idéal pour prendre une bière et essayer plusieurs plats entre amis! La salade de papaye est un must!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian anything restaurant in Montreal. The food is a 10 on 10 and they have super special private wine imports that are exciting and not even that expensive.

The interior is super cool (I heard a brilliant but unknown obscure artist painted the wall trim by hand) and they play 70s reggae and other music that all awesome people with excellent taste will appreciate.

If you don't eat here at least once you are not that smarts. 

Bye badi!"}
{"text":"Today, the sandwich du jour was Quebec themed! With blé d'inde du Quebec, burger and marinated pimente banane! Awesome! Moistened and delicious! 

They have a sort of other things that I already think on coming back and try. 

Concurrence is big here, since you'll find it in the Marché Atwater. But 100% worth the value trying this food. 

Beer and cocktails are also available if you'd like!"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious! I've never been disappointed ordering a meal or a snack from this joint. The food is always super fresh and extremely tasty. I've south Asian cuisine, and this is probably my favorite place to get it. The soup is very good, the sandwiches are great and they satays are great. The service is one thing that I would call almost restaurant like, you order find a table, and before you know it your food it right there in front of you to dig it to."}
{"text":"Si l'endroit vaut le détour en raison de son ambiance et de son mélange d'antiquités singapouriennes, de pop art et de lanternes... L'assiette n'a rien d'extraordinaire."}
{"text":"Trendy place, but food is average. 

Everything is too much salty for me. I guess that's the point so customers order more drinks !

The pork bun is definitely a must try though."}
{"text":"Was looking for Laksa all over town and finally found it by accident on a bike ride to Atwater market.
And it only got better, the laksa was really good, though not enough soup and a bit too creamy. 
The pork buns were the best i've ever had very comparable the Momofuku's nyc.
The satay was great. The peanut sauce was a little too sweet. 
Problem with Montreal street food Is that it's as pricy as normal restaurants because there's isn't enough for competitive price."}
{"text":"love the papaya salad, the ribs were good but a bit too sweet, great buns, the lobster dish is also very spicy and tasty, there famous soup is good but a bit too much coconut milk in it, overall love the place since i'm a big fan of SPICY"}
{"text":"Several people in the neighborhood recommended this as the place to eat and it's clearly a favorite, as the place was packed with a line waiting to get in.  The beer/drink list is the stand out part of this establishment.  Dishes are on the small side and tasted alright and there were even a few veg options for us non-meat eaters, but they were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place just became my new favourite southeast Asian fusion joint. Chill, unpretentious and most important of all: amazing food. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait a bit. We were seated right away and got an amazing spot at the bar in front of the kitchen. We were almost in the kitchen. Coveted spot for me, but some might find it too hot and perhaps distracting. I enjoy watching the cooks do their thing. Plus, you get to see just how clean they are when cooking and prepping the food. 
Must try: the buns and the soup. Does not disappoint. They also have my favourite Thai beer: Singha. Try it."}
{"text":"My cousin Vito told me about place, and Vito never disappoints. The place is boomin' like a Walmart on Black Friday, but the wait is not long. Everything on the menu is amazing and pretty affordable. The environment is cozy and friendly."}
{"text":"We went there for the laksa after seeing all the positive review.. It was just okay , kind of small portion. I agree with some other review that this place is good for hanging out with friends and snack. The music was too loud for me too."}
{"text":"Whether they are in the Atwater Market or at their brick-and-mortar restaurant, I always look forward to eating here. My go-to dishes are: steamed pork bao, green papaya salad, won ton burger, laksa soup, lamb soup. Love their dark and stormy cocktail. Only miss in the years I've been going is the lobster chow mein, due to the lack of toppings versus the amount of noodles. Food is always fresh. Staff are always friendly. If you don't like crowds, then go at lunchtime on a weekend at their restaurant on Notre Dame, when they aren't in the Atwater Market yet."}
{"text":"I want to love this place more: authentic food that stands out, energetic staff; Laksa Laksa Laksa on a cold winter day. And I'm not the only one who thinks so apparently. But they close down several times a year at seemingly random times, and it's almost always packed with long-ish wait times (No reservations?). Signs of a successful restaurant, sure, but its hard to love a restaurant that's almost always a chore to get to. 

Also if you've had the luck to travel and enjoy this cuisine in any of its homelands, the menu's prices will leave a bad taste."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, while visiting Atwater Market with some friends, I tried a food stand called Satay Brothers. Don't exactly remember why I chose that particular food stand for food instead of the other ones present but I was quite happy with my choice that day. Fast forward to today and the Satay Brothers have opened up their prep kitchen on St-Jacques a few blocks over from the market to customers looking for their amazing asian fare during the winter time as well.

The restaurant has a small sitting area of probably about 20 or so people. I arrived solo on a surprisingly busy mid afternoon Saturday. It was busy enough that I was set up at the bar counter since no tables were opening up anytime soon for a solo customer.

To start with, I ordered the green papaya salad with grilled pork. This was a wonderfully fresh and light salad - a combination of what tasted like lemon, lime, mint and basil with the added crunch of peanuts to play with textures. Great start to the meal.

Next up, there was the classic steamed pork buns. A nice piece of fatty pork with some coriander, cucumber and a hoisin-like sauce. I loved these the first time I had them at the market and I still loved them now. 

With the buns, I also added one chicken satay. Perfectly grilled and tender, when you added the amazing peanut sauce, the dish had a great kick to it. Believe me, I hate cucumber but you certainly needed them afterwards to help cleanse the palette.

Finally, for dessert, I decide to try the Kueh Salat. A combination of coconut, stick rice and pandan, this was a perfectly light and sweet dessert that played very well after the rest of the meal.

For all fans of the Satay Brothers from the Market, this is a must-visit to enjoy your usual summer favorites. For the rest of you, this is an extremely worthwhile visit - great food at a very reasonable cost. The Winnicki brothers and their mother have created a wonderfully homie restaurant experience. Alex, who was tending to the floor, was quite active - always interacting with his customers, starting up conversation while keeping service very snappy. The love shown to him and his family from all the patrons is a testament to the attention they put on everyone who comes through that door. I must also praise Alex from being quite understanding towards a situation with me that involved leaving money at a ATM prior to my arrival (unbeknownst to me when I came to pay) which is a problem at a cash only place. Quite the embarrassment for me but Alex was very trusting and was not concerned that I wouldn't come back later on to pay (which I did 20 minutes later). For the way he handle my situation, I thank him very much and, irregardless of the amazing food, he has certainly ensured that I return on a much more frequent basis in the future.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place for a long time and was stoked when my office decided to go out for lunch there. Unfortunately I left very disappointed. We ordered the meat satay, tempeh satay, papaya salad and laksa soup. I enjoyed the meat satay, but not anything else. The soup tasted like spicy soap, and everything else was pretty bland. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fun and busy ambience, the food is as always amazing- best pork buns in town!!  I definitely recommend the resto for sit-in and their awesome spot at Marché Atwater in the summer!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go eat at. We were a group of 7 and had the tasting menu for 30$/person. I thought that it could of been better given all the hype. Out of all the 7 dishes that we had, I really enjoyed the chicken skewers. The wine that our waiter suggested us was, on the other hand, so good that it was halfway through even before the first course! Service was superb! There was a bit of confusion when the bill came so you best check it before paying ;)"}
{"text":"This was our favorite meal in Montreal. My boyfriend was here on a business trip and wanted to come back. Our visit was on a Sunday and it was hopping but luckily we didn't have to wait. 

We loved everything we ordered. It was all seasoned really well. We love a bit of spice and these dishes delivered. The decor and crowd only made the meal better. Lots of energy, attentive servers and a kitchen that was on it and fun to watch from the back bar!

We recommend the mee goreng, the satay skewers, the papaya salad, the beef rendang and the buns! (To be fair, the first time my boyfriend came he said he was underwhelmed by the satay sandwich and the chicken curry so I'd avoid those.)"}
{"text":"Le meilleur : L'ambiance feutrée, many tables availbles mais j'ai trouvé le repas bon mais assez standard comme saveur et il  est cher pour la portion servie ... menu simple et limité... i think is over rated in my opinion. Pensez à demander du riz d'accompagnement or something si vous etes gourmand. Attention allergiques : Satay egale à sauce aux arachides .."}
{"text":"Gosh I'm smitten over this place.

I had visited their Atwater market location a few times before but truth be told, I found it a little pricey for market snacks (at least for the amount of food you get) but with a full sit-down experience I was not disappointed.

I showed up tonight with my family and the server placed us in a cozy self-contained spot in the corner. She painstakingly detailed all the delicious things available on the menu and after we had spent several minutes salivating over the options she offered to make us a menu for the evening- a quick exchange of hungry and smiling glances asserted that, yes, bring us all the delicious things.

Needless to say, I'm not even sure what was brought out to our table but EVERYTHING was phenomenal. That server deserves a gold star. Without getting into detail over the foodgasm that was tonight- you really should go.

The place is also in total hipster-fab decor but not too scene, not yet, at least.
Another bonus is that it's open till ten on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great Thai southeastern food. A bit pricy, but solid."}
{"text":"Having been to the stand a number of times before we decided to check out the restaurant space. 

Later in the evening on a Sunday night in April when St. Henri is typically rather quiet, the restaurant was a great change of pace. The restaurant was busy but not packed and the communal tables don't feel atypically spacious (no elbow rubbing with strangers :) ). The food is the same as at the stand, high quality but a bit on the expensive side (3 steamed sandwiches, 6 satay, shrimp balls, and a pair of small deserts ran $50...  to food is in very small servings could be served from a truck so its a touch pricey).

For desert the Kueh Salat, is a joy and a must have. A gelatinous custard on a bed of sticky coconut rice, it is a wonderful desert and should be had with every meal. 

Food was fast, servers were great, and the vibe was wonderful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE laksa and actively sought out Satay Brothers to get my fix in. 

First we started with the special app of the day--deep fried shrimp donuts. They were absolutely delicious. Then onto my chicken laksa--it was very flavourful, perfect level of spicy, and the egg noodles were very good. 

The atmosphere is super fun and the  service was great. They have a projected big screen on the wall for games, making it a great venue to enjoy the game at. 

Satay Bros did not disappoint!"}
