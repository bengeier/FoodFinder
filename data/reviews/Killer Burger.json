{"text":"This place was Awesome!!! Loved our Burgers, Atmosphere and Customer Service.....thanks Killer Burger and have a Killer Day!!"}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter pickle burger and it was suprisingly quite delicious. The toppings were well balanced and didn't overwhelm. I really like the bun too - very important! The service was top notch: super attentive & friendly. The staff each acted like they were the owner.  Oh yeah, and did I mention free refills on bottomless french fries??!!  I'm not a fan of the new $10-12 price point for burgers in the valley, but the taste and bottomless fries made this worth it.   I would go to Killer Burger again and try one of the other hamburgers - they all sound so good."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place is called Killer Burger - because the burgers are absolutely killer. Their motto is Healing the Hangry. This is their first location outside of the Pacific northwest where they are killing the burger competition. You just have to say Portland, OR and you know that they are going to push the limits in creativity. Every burger is a 1/3 pound 100% beef and includes bacon. The burger that everyone raves about is their peanut butter burger. Bacon, peanut butter, pickle and their delicious smokey house sauce. These guys were making this burger before other restaurants started incorporating it into their menu. You would think the peanut butter would be thick and sticky. But it is actually very smooth and sweet and blends well with the bacon and pickles. It's a great burger! If you like meat, go for the meathead - a double burger with bacon, cheddar and grilled onions. But my personal favorite is the Jose Mendoza. This is Killer Burger's first burger. They pile it with bacon, roasted hatch chilies, Monterey jack, grilled onions and house sauce. Do I need to say more? They have quite a few other crazy burger creations that I am looking forward to trying. Each burger comes with bottomless fries and they also have a nice variety of beers on tap. This isn't the place to start your vegetarian diet. But if you are in the mood for a mouthwatering burger, check them out."}
{"text":"I am from Portland where Killer Burger originated. My wife and I were always regulars there for over 5 years now. Finding out they opened in Phoenix was so amazing I literally cried when I tasted my burger because it was just like home. Oh nostalgia. The peanut butter pickle bacon burger while it sounds weird, will definitely change your life. Great fries, great employees, great beer. YOU NEED TO TRY THESE BURGERS."}
{"text":"I went to Killer Burger in Scottsdale, and all I can say is...WOW! Fantastic burgers!  The fries were excellent, and they gave me lots of fries.  I had the junior classic burger, and I was stuffed.  Plenty of food for the money. If you order the regular size burger, make sure you bring an appetite! Worth every penny, will definitely be going back again. Fantastic hamburgers, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"A buddy from Portland raved about this place and was very excited when a location opened up in Scottsdale, so I decided to try it.  I had the classic burger with everything on it, my friend had the peanut butter burger without grilled onions. I absolutely crushed my burger, it was really good - add the fact that I was super hungry this definitely hit the spot. My friend really liked the PB & Pickle as well, I personally wasn't brave enough to try peanut butter on a burger, but after his positive response to it I will definitely try it on a future visit. The fries here are absolutely awesome as well.   One gripe is the music, it was like 80's hair metal and that is far from my personal favorite. I don't really need to hear Motley Crue as I'm eating a burger lol, but it's not enough to deter future visits from me but let's mix it up ;).  Also, every single employee came and asked us how our meal was... separately. When I tell you that 10 people came to our table and asked how our meal was I am not exaggerating. It was super weird, I hope that was a one time thing because it was a little off-putting.  But if you're in Scottsdale and want to try a really good burger, come here."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood burger place. Casual and super friendly. Great burgers and fries. I ordered a junior and it was still huge. So good."}
{"text":"A true red blooded bonanza.  This place definitely caters to a certain demographic-  gently balding American male between the ages of 30 and 55.  Between the hearty burgers, classic rock, and Space Jam playing on loop you feel carried away to a world full of nostalgia where health concerns are something to consider at a far removed date.  Very solid burgers.  They aren't as guilt inducing as similar offerings in the  class, think Rehab.  A decent import from Portland."}
{"text":"This is our first time at the first and only location in AZ. We loved it when we went to the one in downtown Oregon. We got the Meathead, The Bender and the Jos√© Mendoza."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in as was recommended on my neighborhood NextDoor App..wonderful burgers, we are dairy sensitive ..no worries no cheese! Employees really nice..Great Music playing... can't  wait to dine on their patio in the fall!! Yeah another great place we can walk or bike to in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Killer Burger is the new kid on the block. It has quickly become one of my all time favorites. The service is quick and efficient. You place order at the register, you get a number on a stand and find a seat to wait. Meal is brought to your table. Honestly one of the BEST burgers I have ever had. They offer 9 burger varieties all come with fries and bacon. The options are; the Purist, Classic,Funguy, Jose Mendoza, Barnyard, the Bender, Teemah, and last but not least, Peanut Butter Pickle.  Price range from $9.45-$12.55. Well worth the price, no fillers, and burger equals the size of the delicious crispy bun, nothing skimpy here. I ordered the Funguy with cheese & onions, crispy bacon and large juicy mushrooms. Burgers size is either Original or Junior and succulent, crispy outside and juicy inside, so good it runs down your hand so keep the napkins handy. Fries are good size order and look hand cut not thin sticks, crispy outside and hot soft center. Beverage include soft drinks, wine and beer. Rustic interior, self serve drinks. It's hard to keep a new business going now that the snow birds have left. Do yourself a favor and stop by for one of the best burgers in town. I've had enough of chain store burger joints with mediocre food and more bun than meat. Killer Burger will be money well spent."}
{"text":"I was in the other day to try their burger with peanut better and pickles.  It was really good!  It comes with some very tasty french fries as well.  The burger was quite large and I'll probably go with the Junior size the next time instead of Original.  They also have a nice selection of craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. The Jose Mendoza was fantastic. Burgers have more of a homemade, mom and pop type feel rather than the popular gourmet, over the top places. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good burger.  I had the Teemah. Lots of really good cheesy flavor.  Over powers the burger so can't say what it would taste like plain. Fries just ok.  I would come back. Aoli burger similar.  Wife says she wouldn't. Good music. They have cold beer."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers joints that I have found in a long time. Fresh beef patty's, great tap beer, wine too. We look forward to Friday evenings as this is cheat night. You should really stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Had this in Portland. Was a major factor in me wanting to return to Portland. Now thats in Scottsdale I am very happy. Best burger by far"}
{"text":"Very friendly burger is huge!  Super juicy and great flavor.  Fries are crisp golden and overall this place is spot on!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and we're excited to try this new spot last night with our 3 young kids.  They did not disappoint.  The restaurant is super clean with a great layout and friendly staff.  The burgers were delicious and come with fries.  They also have games at the table to play with the kids.  Overall just a great family spot to take the kids, and it's just down the street.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"While I didn't actually love what I ordered (The Fun Guy) I did really like the quality of the meat and the terrifically crisp french fries. It turns out that the Fun Guy (great pun as it has mushrooms) and the Teemah both have fondue cheese on them. Some probably love this, but I am not a fan. As noted, the beef was great (and I am notoriously picky about beef). The staff was awesome - very friendly! Ambiance is fun (games, cards, etc.) on tables encourage you to stay, play and have at least one more beer. I will go back...and maybe get brave enough to one day even try that burger with peanut butter."}
{"text":"It is open.  Went there tonight and decided to start with the \"Classic Burger\".  It was a good burger, and they offer bottomless fries, although after a large burger I couldn't even finish my original serving of fries.  I like the way they do the fries, crunchy solid fries, but not the huge steak fries.  Really good fries.  If I could hope for anything better it was that both the fries and the burger was heavy on the salt.  I like salt, so it isn't a situation where I like thinks unsalted, but the salt was pretty heavy.  Still a good meal.  Also, friendly staff and nice environment.  I'll be back to try some of the other customized burger offerings."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be part of Friends and Family soft opening. We have eaten at 2 locations in Portland and this was even better!!!! The peanut butter burger, The Bender burger and fries were honestly-outstanding. Great selection of beer. Thank you Zach, Tony and staff for a taste of Portland, now in Scottsdale!!!!!  It is such a treat for a such a quality burger - toppings and perfectly salted fries. Can you tell I'm a fan!!!  Please give them a try!"}
{"text":"Wow I know it's just a burger place but boy it was tasty. I got the barnyard burger which was a little pricey for a burger but I made 2 meals out of it so it was a bargin. They also have my new favorite fries. A bit of a drive if you don't live in Scottsdale but imo it was worth it."}
{"text":"Brought the whole family here tonight, which includes our three kiddos under three. Very accommodating to families. We liked the board games they had sitting out as they entertained our daughter. Food was delicious!!! I got the Peanut Butter burger and my husband got the spicy burger. The fries were seasoned perfectly. The layout was great and I liked their condiment section on the wall. We will be going there again in the near future!!!!"}
{"text":"Haiku Review!  Best burger in town  Try the PB & pickle  Great music, nice staff   In all seriousness, my girlfriend and I really enjoyed our meal here. We got the PB & Pickle and the Teemah burgers and both were amazing. My girlfriend appreciated that you could opt for a smaller size burger. We also liked how the bacon on the burger was crispy and not chewy. We will definitely be returning here!!"}
{"text":"Came here for an evening dinner. The happy hour doesn't apply to the food just drinks. I had the peanut butter burger. The sauce was great just didn't have any fresh veggies and wasn't a fan of how much mayo they put on the burger. Fries were crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"My wife just went and picked up food there. Best burger and fries I've had in a longgggg time. Fries are a medium cut and nice and crispy. Burger has great seasonings and is very very flavorful. I should clarify that I had plain burger with nothing on it. I like to taste the meat without tons of toppings. She said it's very kid friendly in the restaurant with a rock n roll theme. She said great customer service and very friendly"}
{"text":"Just had my first Killer Burger (the Jose Mendoza)and it will not be my last!  Juicy, full of flavor and the bun is the best.  Finally, a great Burger joint!  Great service too."}
{"text":"Great burgers, large beer selection and a very friendly wait staff....a must for burger lovers!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!! Madi the manager took care of us, including making our food and serving us everything we needed- she is THE BEST! Love that we were able to customize our own burgers, and the cajun seasoning for the fries was the best part."}
{"text":"A Friday lunch break seemed like the perfect time to finally check out this spot.   Upon walking in, you approach the counter to order. They have menus in front of the register for you to review. There is a beer list to the right on a board, and it looks like they have two kinds of wine in cans as well. They also have soda of course. Their burgers all come with bacon and fries, and you can pick between a regular size and a junior size. We got junior sizes and were pretty full.   The girl at the counter was friendly and let us know they bus the tables so not to worry about our trays after we are done. I appreciated the heads up because sometimes I've gone to a place and had that awkward moment of.. do I clear this myself... do I not.... what is that table over there doing?? So phew. Avoided that.   Once you order you get a number to place on the table. They bring your food out to you. There were three of us and we all opted for different things:  Peanut Butter Burger: this came with peanut butter sauce, pickle, bacon, mayo, onion and house sauce. This was my choice and it was SO surprisingly good. The peanut butter taste was there but I didn't think it was too overpowering. It gave the burger a slight \"sweetness\" to it. I may not order it every time but I would order it again and am glad I tried it.   Purist: this is supposed to come with mayo and ketchup, but my partner ordered it plain just with cheese. They give you the bacon on the side either way. A decent burger.   Classic: the usual... bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, house sauce, onion and pickle. My friend got this one and was happy with it. Lives up to the name for sure.   Fries: thicker cut and nothing crazy but I enjoyed them. Not too much skin on them either. They had seasoning I put on mine that I really liked. They worked.   For the three of us to eat, with one soft drink and two waters, it was about $27 dollars. Not too bad. I thought for the amount of food and the quality the price is a nice value.   They have several tables, some hi top, some regular and a couple of picnic tables. Ketchup and napkins are on the tables. The wall near the entrance has additional condiments, such as mustard, seasoning, hot sauce, etc. you can grab if you need it. I did put that back myself though.   Overall I enjoyed this spot. Casual but delicious burgers that hit the spot. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The peanut butter burger is great! We were one of the lucky customers to take advantage of it for $3. My wife had the fun burger and that was good also! All orders come with hand cut fries with skin. The people there were also kind and the dining room was roomy. Just don't rub your hands on the wood boards because you could get a splinter."}
{"text":"I've had this place on my radar since I found out it was coming. Imagine my let down to see all of the burgers are beef, with an option for a vegan patty only, no turkey or chicken burgers offered. This completely misses the mark for people who don't eat red meat, but aren't vegan. I wanted to make a review to give all those like me out there a heads up that this place does not have anything on the menu for us. So, unless you are graving a vegan burger, you won't find anything other fries on to eat. Interesting way to exclude a nit so small group of people."}
{"text":"Interesting new burger spot. They have 10 other locations in the Northwest area of the country. All their burgers are a third of a pound come with bacon and bottomless fries. Burgers are all cooked medium to medium well but are still juicy. They had a special for their first week of opening which is there peanut butter bacon burger with bottomless fries for $3. Pretty tasty burger overall and definitely will be going back to try some other ones."}
{"text":"Short & to the point... the restaurant itself I liked. You were greeted by nice staff. It was clean & the aroma was wonderful! Beer selection was fine (I don't drink) but they do offer samples. Which I thought was cool. There are games on some of the tables which we played while we waited on our food.  Fries were good. Now when I eat a burger, I also like to taste the meat. But.... there was so much sauce, onions, cheese, etc. that covered & seeped over it. It was too messy, once you set it down to take a drink or eat your fries.. you won't be able to pick it up in one piece again.  We will not go back. Sorry ?"}
{"text":"I love the prices I love the fact that you can have a Junior burger and not necessarily a huge burger I love the fact that you get fries with every burger the place has a fun vibe!!"}
