{"text":"Food was amazing. Most people would drove right by this place, but they had some amazing food. A chimi that made your mouth water and some great street tacos. Not much for looks, but the food is worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Horrible cooking first of all ! The meat is super dry and hard to the point where your teeth hurt . It's not the first time this happens they shouldn't be lazy . The cooks should cook new meat not reheat it throughout the entire day , same goes with the cold hard tortillas. I'm a person how hates throwing food away but it was to the point where I had no other choice...not even my dog should eat it . Hope they improve and take this advice!"}
{"text":"My friend  Joe has been asking  us to try for the last month.  We tried the new location on northern  and 13th street.  It was nice and clean . There was one customer  at 6.30. . The cashier  was not helpful.  I ordered  2 quesadillas  and chips . The quesadillas were delicious .. chips were a little  firm . Asked for silverware for 6 and got servings  utensils.  We ordered several tacos but it took about 15 to 20 minutes  for the food to come out . I had the ham and eggs breakfast  burrito . The ham was overcooked.  I also had the green chili platter.  It was tender . I did like the rice. They don't have water. Place seems disorganized.  I will  try again"}
{"text":"I came by here on a Friday at about 830pm and they were pretty busy. The Carne asada street tacos were very good and so were the refried beans, but the rice that came with the meal was dried out, hence the 4 stars. I would definitely come back just for the tacos, though."}
{"text":"Me and my family go their every Friday night and tonight I asked for my tacos with everything and this is what I got 3 pieces of celantro and 4 pieces of onion on 8 tacos"}
{"text":"This place is tucked into a tiny strip mall on 19th, west side of road. South of Peoria. It's pretty easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. It's across the street from Manhattan Giant Pizza if that helps.  Finally stopped in here for Taco Tuesday. 75 cent street tacos. Carne asada and al pastor are featured. I'm not sure if the deal applies to other variations like cabeza or tongue. Bottled Beers are 2 bucks during happy hour. That even applies to things like Negra Modelo. The tacos aren't the BEST street tacos I've had, but they are a good deal at that price! The salsa bar has the usual accoutrements too. Radishes and cukes are also on there. They only had one salsa on display at the bar, fairly tame- but they had some much hotter stuff behind the counter which they gladly provided.  Most of the families dining there were Hispanic, and not all were there for the taco deal. The menu offers plenty of other fare, so you can diversify from the tacos if you like. They do have a fish taco, which I'll try at a later date. Always nice to know where you can get a decent fish taco when the urge strikes, ya know?  They seem to offer a full bar. You order cocktails along with your food. I'm not sure where they make said cocktails, as I didn't see a traditional bar anywhere."}
