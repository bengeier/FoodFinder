{"text":"I'm a big fan of these simple menus especially when it comes to food trucks. These guys do Greek sandwiches and not much else. The sandwiches are good, portions are very fair for the price, and service is pretty quick.  I usually go for one of the $1 additions you can make to any sandwich. I'm a fan of the Sloppy Twin (hummus and olives) but you can do the Hot Twin (Sriracha and Htipiti), the Smelly Twin (skordalia).You can sub out the tzatziki for lemon juice (Slim Twin) at no charge."}
{"text":"I went to the Food Truck Friday at Sycamore Brewing where they were attending. By the time I got to order they were out of lamb. Which was a very big disappointment. That was the only thing my wife wanted so she did not get anything.  I got a Greek burger pita.  I was told 15-20 mins.  It took 45 mins to get my food. Even after they stopped taking orders the food didn't come out any faster.    The rating would have been lower until I ate my food.  The burger was very good.  It tasted like some of the ones I have had in Greece.  Hopefully that next time they will lamb."}
{"text":"If you order anything make sure you stand right next to the truck otherwise you will be served cold food then if you dare to ask for warm food they will state that they have been calling your name for longer than you placed the order. #NOCUSTOMERSERVICE #COLDFRIES #YUCK"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite food truck, everything used to be so hot and fresh. The past 3 times I've visited it's been cold and not nearly as delicious as they used to be"}
{"text":"Amazing gyros! We stalk these guys all over the city and make weekend plans to be where they are. Plus they are all around great guys and provide great customer service."}
{"text":"I had the greek salad with lamb and spinach pie for lunch today and it was amazing. If you are really hungry but still want some greens this is definitely the way to go! I have had a lot of greek food in restaurants around New York and Europe and these guys are right up to standard - even from a food truck kitchen. Highly recommended if you see them out and about!"}
{"text":"These guys come by our office every other Wednesday and although the food is what initially hooked me, it is their hospitality and personalities that has kept me coming back for months.  I can't speak for everything on the menu as I'm a traditionalist and never stray far from a good lamb gyro. Customer service goes a long way and these twins have made me a customer for live."}
{"text":"My go to Greek spot!! Need my weekly fix Hands down best gyro in town and get the Greek fries"}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything on their menu, especially the gyro! It's the only authentic and most fresh gyro you find in Charlotte! I can always find where they will be on Instagram!"}
