{"text":"GO!  I have only been here once and absolutely loved it! Everything was fresh, homemade and just down right YUMMY! The, made right when you order it ,Tangerine Lemonade is sooooo good I don't even have any words. My chicken noodle soup was perfect and when I go back I will be getting the meatloaf sandwich as I heard it was \"great\" but they had just ran out:(  It's a cute little place and the ladies there are so friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the turkey and avocado sandwich (which is huge!) and the tomato soup. Both were fantastic. The owner immediately greeted us and let us know she could make anything special for our kids so we opted for a yummy grilled cheese. Great people and great fresh food!"}
{"text":"I had the quiche today (broccoli) and it was excellent. Next time I want to try the green chile quiche, but the sandwiches also sounded amazing. I wish they were open on weekends because I don't work in the area. Today they had a fresh squeezed tangerine lemonade which was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  The service was friendly. They made me feel comfortable the moment I walked in because I wasn't sure where to order. This is the perfect local place to support."}
{"text":"I so enjoy going to Cafe Cornucopia.  The owners make all of the food, and it is so delicious.  I have literally tried everything on the menu, and have yet to find anything that I do not like.  My favorite is the soup of the day with a small Greek salad.  So refreshing and tasty!  The meatloaf sandwich is awesome, when I'm in the mood for something more substantial.  Try the potato salad as a side.  It reminded me of home in the Midwest.  The baked goods are terrific, too.  The lemon bars taste just like my mom used to make, and she was a fantastic baker.  They are on the southeast corner of Rural and Ray, on the west end of the shopping center, facing west.  Go and find them."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and soups.  I've had the meatloaf sandwich and the egg salad sandwich, as well as their chicken tortilla soup.  The bread is unbelievable.    It's a hard place to find, but well worth the hunt.  The staff is incredibly friendly, and overall just a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Amazing sweet potato soup with pecans on top. Fall has arrived! Love this place! The food is so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is flavorful - perfect!  The people were friendly and very personable.  I ate: Meatloaf sandwich on marbles rye: amazing! Potato salad: good Fresh-squeezed tangerine lemonade: wow!  I would not hesitate to order this exact meal again. The potato salad was very good, but the flavor of the meatloaf sandwich was so good that it skewed the rating of the meatloaf from awesome down to good."}
{"text":"Always great food and the people are so nice!  I LOVE their quiche, and their soups are to die for!  I particularly appreciate that they make everything from scratch, which is a rarity with chain restaurants on every corner and in every strip mall.  PLEASE try this place.  You won't be sorry you did!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Super friendly and out going. Great recommendation on the chicken salad sandwich. Best I've had in a long time. The lentil soup was delicious and hearty. My lady had the meatloaf sandwich which was definitely homemade and was a mammoth sized slab of meatloaf. She had the butternut squash soup which was tasty as well. An awesome experience overall and delicious food. Will surely be back. Cool artwork to check out on the walls."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant!  Homemade food, sandwiches, and desserts."}
{"text":"Delicious!   We used Yelp to help us find an impromptu place for lunch while out antiquing.  We were not disappointed!   This place is a casual atmosphere with an owner that has a witty, fun personality that cares about what she serves.  Limited menu of salads, sandwiches,  2 soups of the day, and quiche.  I got the Quiche Lorraine hands down best ever!  It came with a soup or salad, I chose the house salad.  Only one dressing available - lemon/oil homemade.   I was skeptical but loved it - wished I had added the feta cheese. Maybe the best part of the meal was my fresh squeezed tangerine lemonade!   4 of us ate here and all of us were very pleased with our meals.  Another plus was we spotted something on a cookie sheet - breaded eggplant - that wasn't on the menu.  After inquiring the owner laughed, gave us some (free) and said they were extras from an event they had catered over the weekend.   Wow, we're they ever good!"}
{"text":"I had been to the original restaurant in Bisbee and just loved it. I was happy that the owners decided to move north and open in Tempe. Everyday/week they change their menu. Its homemade, delicious, and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so I can only comment on those items...  Everything really is homemade and tastes like you momma just made you lunch :) The sandwich breads are always sooo fresh.  I've had the veggie and green chile sandwiches - both were good.  The soups are great - and they aways have a veggie broth based option.  The teas/lemonades are fantastic as well.   Lunch is a bit pricey...I typically spend about $10-12 - but I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"Took my 6 year old to urgent care next door to this place. I saw the owners bring the secretary a lunch so I asked her about it. I'm so glad I went there! My boyfriend and I got a to go order(meatloaf sandwich, turkey, cheese, and avocado sandwich, and butternut squash soup). The owner brought the order to me and talked to my son(with his broken wrist). She played with him and then gave him a DELICIOUS chocolate chip cookie! I was driving home I reached in and pulled out the buttered bread that came with the soup. It was the best bread I have ever tasted! I live 25 minutes from there, but have to make more trips to the urgent care for my sons injury! I can't wait to go back there! I really want to try everything there! I wonder if they can sell me a whole loaf of their bread??!!!"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from here I have seen many different restaurants come and go in this location so wasn't sure when I saw a sign for Cafe Cornucopia.  I probably wouldn't have checked them out had my g/f not told me how fabulous they were and wanted to meet there.  Boy, am I glad she suggested it.  Everything truly is homemade and you can taste the quality.  I was debating what to have and when I asked about the corn chowder soup, she said they didn't use cream or butter so, I wasn't sure if it would be brothy (which I didn't want).  She immediately offered to get me a sample and it was delicious!  I had the cheddar and chili quiche with a side of the corn chowder soup.  It was FABULOUS!  The soup was the perfect texture - creamy - very hot and flavorful.  The soup comes with a side of bread which was so insanely good.The quiche was the perfect texture with a nice cheesy flavor and just a hint of kick from the chilis.  My g/.f had the turkey avocado sandwich with the tomato basil soup and she said both were fabulous (and they looked it)  The service was friendly without being overbearing and you get a great vibe and can tell this is not a chain and they all really care about your experience.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks, friendly service! I loved their flavored lemonade and sandwiches. I took my family, who came from out of town and we sat and talked for a little bit after finishing our meal. The worker offered us some brownies on the house, which again were delicious! Loved everything about this place and will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"What a gem. And to think I've been by here a thousand times and didn't take the time to investigate. Well, today was the day, and boy, was it sure good! Very \"down homey\" food that left me feeling completely satisfied when I was finished. The meatloaf sandwich was way better than I expected, as was the chili and the tangerine lemonade.   Looking forward to trying the wonderful-looking sweets."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here and everyone at my table enjoyed what they ordered too! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"FANS & FANATICS of this restaurant  -  I went there today and it's gone!  A note on the door said that it has been sold"}
{"text":"A wonderful place for lunch. Jeanie and Pattie are so friendly which adds tithe plus of outstanding food. Soups, quiches, salads and desserts are all outstanding. A must on our list all the time.  Gene and Laurie"}
{"text":"Wow.  Nice place.  Thai chicken soup was very good.  Same can be said for the green chile quiche.  Cannot say w/ 100% certainty it was good for the ole arteries but it certainly was for the taste buds.  Service was friendly.  Dining space was clean.  Hope they stick around b/c I'll be back.     As an aside I overheard customers come in behind me.  Patron was talking about particular health issue/s one of her party had & I was impressed that, even down to the lemonade, the business accommodated whatever her particular situation warranted.  Impressive."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade sandwiches and soups...will remind you of grandmas!  A half sandwich and cup of soup is more than enough to fill you up.  Their homemade bread has just the right amount of sweetness and tastes more like a dessert than \"bread!\".  The owners and staff are very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at Cafe Cornucopia twice in the past 2 weeks and both times have been exceptional! The place is very inviting and nicely decorated with cool artwork on the walls.The staff is super friendly and the prices are very reasonable.  The first time, I tried the quiche of the day and garden salad. Both were delicious! The vegetables are so fresh and the homemade dressing on the salad was so tasty. The second time, I had the vegetarian sandwich and tomato soup and my husband had the meatloaf sandwich. Everything was outstanding again!  The true star though, in my opinion, is their homemade bread that comes with the soup or salad. OMG, I can't get enough. I even had to buy a few extra slices to take home with me!   I will definitely be dining here on a regular basis and I hope that employees at the neighboring companies take note and start frequenting this little gem of a cafe!"}
{"text":"I was in AZ on business last week and stumbled across this cafe by sheer chance.  I went 2 days in a row because the food was delish!  I had their meatloaf and Lentil Soup with sweet Italian sausage on the first day.  I went back and had the Carrot Ginger soup and treated myself to a lemon bar.  SUPERB!  The service was impeccable and the owners are very energetic and friendly.  I'm not a local but the next time I'm back in AZ, I'll be stopping by!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by Cafe Cornucopia for months since it is right in my neighborhood. Since I couldn't see in the windows I had no idea what I was missing. The cafe is delightfully homey inside. You can sit at the counter, or at a table in one of two rooms. The Thai peanut chicken soup with sweet potatoes was amazing. It comes with a slice of the cafe's homemade bread, which is delicious. My husband had the asparagus quiche and the tomato basil soup, both of which were excellent.  The owners are friendly and very accommodating. Eating at the Cornucopia Cafe is like being invited into someone's home to eat delicious home cooked food. It's not like Grandma's though because the decor is definitely stylish and a step above what Granda's house looks like. I am just disappointed that I didn't stop by months ago since I have been missing out on a true neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"WOW...real homemade food!  These gals from Bisbee really know what they're doing in the kitchen.  My wife LOVED the spinach quiche and I LOVED the meatloaf sandwich...and we both LOVED the fabulous lemon square for dessert.  Fresh bread complimented both of our dishes.  We definitely recommend giving this place a try, just remember they're only open M - F."}
{"text":"Super Duper  \"Souper\" with a sandwich, quiche  or salad.   Don't look for it on Ray, or you will miss it!  It faces Rural. The sad news is that they are not opened on the weekends.  We asked if we could buy a loaf of their bread and learned that you have to order it a day ahead. One of the owners followed us out after we had our lunch and introduced herself, and said that the day was almost over and she had two loafs left if we wanted it. You bet! She told us that it is made without preservatives, and so three days was it's shelf life. Yeah..like it will last that long with us! Love it!  I loved the counter service, takes ya back to the days when you were a kid and had lunch at your local soda jerk drug store. It gives you a feeling of neighborhood friendliness. It will be our new place to go, for great food, and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  They make everything from scratch.  The meatloaf sandwich is my favorite and you have to try the potato salad, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch at Cafe Cornucopia many times over the past few months since finding it, and have never been disappointed....ever.  I feel like I've been around the East valley, have eaten practically everywhere, and yet this is the only place that succeeds with every single dish. I feel a big part of that has to do with the two ladies behind the counter and their commitment to their culinary craft. No pretention, no false marketing, just awesome, high-quality, hand-crafted food."}
{"text":"Coming here is like going to my friend's grandma's ranch house. I've never had anything here that's bad.... the quiche is ridiculous! I don't eat meat and they always have vegetarian options, which is a huge plus. We usually come here once a week for lunch and always look forward to it. Everything here is homemade. Just do yourself a favor and get the quiche, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Followed the other reviews on Yelp and so glad we did!!! The food was fresh and full of flavor...yum! Meatloaf sandwich was better than moms, soup was delicious too! Finished up with homemade cookies. The owner was welcoming and very kind. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I try meatloaf everywhere it's on the menu and it was great, so was  the split pea soup.  The staff was very helpful, even gave us golfers a tip on a new course to play.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Food is always fresh and delicious.  We come here at least 3 times a week for lunch and are never disappointed.  The soups are to die for and they have the best lemon bar I have ever had!  Best part is the owners...they are so sweet and make a point to know all their customers!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I love this place! Real good food made with care and love. The soups and quiches are always fantastic, and the bread served as a side is dense and sweet and delicious.   The sandwiches are the weakest point in the menu, but that's like saying the lock is the weak point in safe. In other words, they're really good too.   Daily specials offset the small regular menu, so there's always something new to try. And be sure to try the tangerine lemonade. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Everything I ate; chicken tortilla soup, spinach and mushroom quiche, green chili quiche, a lemon square and coffee, was quality. Even the side of bread they gave with the soup was great. Everything tasted fresh and well thought through. I feel like this place doesn't serve anything they are not proud of. I loved watching the kitchen staff preparing orders in front of me. I presume the owners of the joint were the ones checking every plate to ensure what was going out met their exacting standards.   I look forward to trying their other offerings. And, yes, real men eat quiche now."}
{"text":"I live in California but fly here frequently to see my family. The food is wonderfully fresh and delicious. I wrote a review last year because I was to impressed with the quality of the soups, salad, quiches, sandwiches, homemade bread and desserts. It still rates 5 stars. Patti and Jeannie and the crew are friendly, attentive and love to cook!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem with friendly service and delicious food. They serve a simple menu of hearty, warm, homey food. I tried their green chile quiche and carrot ginger soup and was impressed with flavors."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for lunch.  Went here with a group of ladies on a F.A.R.T. (Fabric accumulation road trip).  I had a turkey sandwich with out of this world homemade potato salad.  The ladies running this cafe truly have the personality and cooking skills that can only come from loving what you do.  At the end of our meal we were treated with bite size dessert samples, complimentary and delicious!  Well worth checking out this gem of a restaurant! All menu items looked great!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want to be where everybody knows your name  Super homemade food w awesome staff. Great local flavor"}
{"text":"This place is by South east corner of Rural & Ray Roadplace & its a hidden gem! Veg 1/2 Sandwich & Soup combo was heavenly. No fancy ambiance but definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Fresh homemade food and friendly service!  The green chile quiche was tasty and had a  punch  of heat to it!   The side of Greek salad was also fresh and tasty!  I plan to return!"}
{"text":"I don't know which was worse.....the prices or the customer service. This place is expensive for the quality of what comes out. The staff was rude and very short. I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich and vegetable soup were amazing! The place was bright and lively and the service extraordinary. Got to meet Patty and Jeanie, the owners, too and they have a great story. Nice spot for the local lunch club to meet. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is definitely home style which is a plus. Food is good but not outstanding. I got the greek salad and since it had no meat in it i added chicken so it cost me over $12 and I was still hungry after (more of a side salad really). In another visit i had the Meatloaf sandwich which was good and the homemade bread they give you on the side with some of the meals is tasty as well.  The major issue is its pricey for want you get, otherwise would be a higher rating."}
{"text":"Food is bland, over priced & short haired older lady is rude to customers. Loudly discussing politics is tacky, not greeting customers, also tacky. Bad business doesn't attract anyone. I'll take my hard earned money elsewhere & tell my friends and family to do the same!"}
{"text":"Pretty cute spot - the highlight really is the friendly staff and clean interior.  The food itself is fair and fairly priced.  I'm typically not a sandwich lunch kind of person but my wife is.  We tried the meatloaf sandwich, potato salad, quiche, and a salad.  Also a lemon bar dessert for my wife.  All were tasty and fairly straightforward.  I say if you are in the area give this place a try."}
{"text":"Our favorite lunch place when I meet hubby, who works nearby.  Staff is always friendly, and food is always hot, fresh and delicious to the last bite!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Kind service but not overly friendly--no flair or grinning here. I enjoyed my quiche and soup, though I was skeptical when I saw it was warmed in a microwave. But it was cheesy and tasty."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat !   The food is amazing and the staff is a delight.  A must try !"}
{"text":"Very good home cooked food; prepared with care by a very friendly \"mom & pop\" type team. The location is tricky to find off of Rural South of Ray on the East side of the road."}
{"text":"Eh. It was ok.   My husband and I decided to visit after reading the pretty good yelp reviews. The ladies behind the counter were super friendly, great customer service, which is so rare now-a-days. My husband and I both got 1/2 sandwiches, soup and salad and 2 desserts and it ended up being $40 ($48 after tip) - kinda pricey for a sandwich place. I would have much rather gone to Paradise Bakery.  Despite the reviews, I didn't enjoy the meatloaf sandwich, it was way too bulky for a sandwich and was loaded with mayo - yuck. Tangerine lemonade was boring, not enough flavor (Pita Jungle is way better), but the strawberry lemonade was tasty. My husband's ribeye sandwich was ok, the sauce was pretty good. The lemon bar was pretty yummy however the fruit in the peach cobbler was hard; I like my peach cobbler filling soft.   Again, great customer service, but wont be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh food and great service! Had the meatloaf sandwich with greek salad, you could smell the freshness of the  salad and sandwich and it was incredible. The ladies working are hilarious and very friendly, I felt like I was sitting at home in my own kitchen.   Also, had the brownie that was incredible, I recommend this place, we're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great homemade soup and meatloaf sandwich.  Scrumptious lemon bar and handcrafted strawberry lemonade.  Friendly service too.  My first visit but it won't be my last."}
{"text":"Hard to beat the homemade goodness coming out of this place.  I've had every sandwich and several of the soups and quiches.  Nothing I've eaten here has been short of excellent.  I absolutely love the piece of bread that comes with the soup, just wish it was bigger.   Favorites:  Chile Jack and meatloaf sandwiches"}
{"text":"Somehow, I wrote an earlier review and it is GONE-  Anyway-  Easy Review-  GREAT PLACE- GREAT FOOD- FRESH Personal NOT a Chain Restaurant- RECOMENDED!  Need to Know-  Can / Will be Busy over Lunch  Dining Room is a bit noisy-    Enjoy!!!  Matt"}
{"text":"Quality food indeed. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich cup of soup special  The sandwich was a warm one with applewood smoked ham, melted jack cheese, mild hatch green chile, cucumber, tomato, Dijon mustard, and mayo on on a marbled rye bread.   The soup was roasted garlic. It wasn't overly thick, and had a great taste. They also give you a slice of awesome fresh back bread.   I also ordered the tangerine lemonade and a glass of water. The lemonade was amazing and the water was definitely filtered.   The food and the service were great.   The only downside of this place is that they are not set up to get you through the line quickly. They hand write orders and if there are a few people in front of you it takes a few minutes to order. They don't rush anyone and offer samples. Which is great I only offer this up for full disclosure in case time is an issue.   The place us not cheap either. I spent $15 on lunch because the lemonade was $3.25.  I didn't mind because it is definitely quality food and tasted wonderful. It was more than I planned on spending though.   They knew a lot of the names of the customers so it obviously the care and get quite a few repeat customers."}
{"text":"The ladies who run this place are fantastic. Great with names and faces, even better with quiche and desserts! Lunch specials could have slightly better pricing, but homemade food like mom used to make isn't cheap these days."}
{"text":"I went here right after I moved to Phoenix and was very impressed at the food and even more impressed with the service. Seriously, some of the best service I have ever received. The entire staff was friendly and happy. You could tell that they all loved their jobs, and wanted their customers to come back. We were there towards the end of the day so they even gave us a few cookies to go. We will be back and I would highly recommend Cafe Cornucopia."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Everyone is so nice! It's like being served by family! The quiche is heavenly. I love the marble rye for their sandwiches. Especially the tuna! I have to keep coming I. To try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Cheers!  It IS where the owners know your name!  And we go both 'cause they do (and also, the entertainment is free!) and the food, you can't beat!  Homemade, from scratch.......mmmm good.  Haven't had a thing I don't like, and I have recently accompanied it with the fresh squeezed tangerine or strawberry lemonade.  This luncheonette is amazing!  Patti and Jeannie you guys are THE best!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A local soup, sandwich, salad, and quiche place that does it right! I had the meatloaf sandwich on marbled rye bread with a dill pickle ($9). The bread was homemade, soft and delicious all by itself. The meatloaf was a thick slab of moist (not at all crumbly) flavorful meat with a super ripe tomato and crunchy lettuce and mayo. The full sandwich is extremely filling. My friend had quiche and homemade soup. She loved the flavors. There were some awesome looking lemon bars, scones, pies and other baked goods that we were too full to sample. There are tables and chairs in two rooms and the place is super clean with some interesting local artwork on the walls. The staff was helpful and cheerful and looked like they enjoyed interacting with each other and the customers.  Parking is close to the door. I highly recommend giving this place a try! :-)"}
{"text":"It was $16 for a slice of quiche and lemon bar. And when I walked in and stood at the counter, no one said hello to me even though they all saw me walk in. I stood for another minute before the lady behind the counter quite rudely said \"well do you need more time to figure out what you want?\"  Great greeting. I was clearly ready to order when I walked in. She made me feel like I was in convenience because they were \"understaffed\" for the day. With a little nicer customer service they could have had me come back another time. Although, come to think of it, not sure the food was worth the $16. That's a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Wonderful homemade quiche!   We also had side salads served with a oil and vinegar (homemade)salad dressing. The lemon squares are delicious too!   Nice, friendly and courteous staff.  Casual dining.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything they make is amazing!! From their green chili quiche to their blueberry scones. They even catered our Thanksgiving dinner.  The service is like no other. I recommend this place and we eat there often."}
{"text":"If you haven't been - Go!! Everything is great!! From their homeade simple salad dressing to the lemon squares!! Both I can't live without!! Jeanie & Patty make this place THE place to lunch at! Their memory for names is outstanding too!! The only bad part is they aren't open longer & more - but they need a (happy) life too!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I dropped in for lunch on a Tuesday based on its Yelp reviews. Cafe Cornucopia is a cute cafe serving lots of homemade options from quiches to light lemon vinaigrette salads to sandwiches and soups. I opted for the spinach and mushroom quiche, side salad, and freaky fruity smoothie. All were delicious and clearly homemade. The staff were all pleasant and knew every patron by first name. We were served a complimentary tasting of the lemon bar, which is insane. It looks deflated and sad, but there was the perfect amount of tartness and sweet to satisfy you at the end of a meal."}
{"text":"OMG is all I can say. I tried out this place when I was supposed to meet a work colleague there at her suggestion. She got her days mixed up on her calendar, so she didn't make it, but I stayed because it just smelled and looked so appealing, and boy was I glad! It has to be one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I had the quiche (green chile variety), which also came with soup or salad. I had the tomato basil soup (definitely not like the canned Campbell's variety). It also had a triangle of bread, buttered, and two slices of tomato. Then for dessert I splurged and got the peach-raspberry cobbler. Oh my. The best cobbler I've ever had of any flavor. Everything is so simple yet \"gourmet\" and the emphasis is on fresh ingredients and great taste. There are also lots of vegetarian options if you lean that way (which I do). The waitstaff is very friendly and approachable, and the owner came out and talked to some of the patrons, whom she (and other employees) knew by name. My only gripe was that day the light wasn't working properly in their restroom so I went to the bathroom in almost total darkness. LOL :) Also, if you order soda, it comes from a can, so it's not like you can just top off your glass at the soda fountain. But overall, this is the best-kept lunchtime secret in Chandler. Shhhhhh! Don't tell anyone, because it's not overly huge and I want to save a table for myself."}
{"text":"Tangerine Lemonade is as fresh as fresh can be. Delicious.  Green Chile quiche. First thing I want on a quiche is perfect crust. Well let me tell you, perfect. The quiche body, cheese, eggs and green chiles. A little heat from the chiles. Being from East LA, the heat was just right. This is the way quiche is ment to be. Enjoy."}
{"text":"If you find yourself ANYWHERE in the Phoenix area, make your way to Chandler for fantastic green chile cheddar quiche, chicken salad, homemade bread, and berry cobbler. Everything is made daily and truly delicious - such a treat! We saved the brownie for the airplane ride home and it was all we could do not to turn around and go back to Chandler ... From Tulsa!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a great new place for lunch?  Cafe Cornucopia is one of the local mom-and-pop restaurants that I love to frequent at least once every couple weeks.  If it's your first time, try one of the daily quiche specials with a bowl of soup and fresh-squeezed lemonade.  They are all homemade and amazing!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to town this is my #1 stop for the best quiche,salads and meatloaf sanwiches oh excuse me I have to take another bite delish!!"}
{"text":"The green chile quiche is absolutely AMAZING! I can't say enough good things about the food or the people at Cafe Cornucopia. It's obvious that the food is made with the freshest ingredients and the staff makes you feel welcome from the second you walk in the door. Today was our first visit and we will be regular customers from now on, without a doubt."}
{"text":"We found Cafe Cornucopia on yelp and had am amazing lunch. I ordered the Greek salad. The romaine lettuce was so fresh and crisp and the salad had a delicious lemon dressing. They gave both my husband and I a sample of the sous.. DE-lish. Will go back to Phoenix from Tucson just to have lunch here again"}
{"text":"tastey homestyle food made from scratch. the green chile quiche was excellent. plan on going back for the meatloaf sandwich."}
{"text":"I really dont give five stars lightly but this is a fair assessment of a lovely little gem here in Chandler. It is quaint , clean extremely friendly and most importantly delicious . The food prep area is wide open and you can see the home made food in the making . They have fresh lemonades that are yummy as well as very generous sandwiches . A half is more than enough . The salads are fresh and they have homemade quiche combos . The soups are very flavorful . I have not sampled their sweets . They look amazing and I'm sure a splurge is in my future . There is ample seating for a relaxing lunch or quick efficient take out ."}
{"text":"Talk about fresh! This place feels like your at a farmers market. The price is so reasonable for his good this food is. Gourmet sandwiches have found a home."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin! This place is just fantastic all around! It's only about 0.8 miles from my apartment, and I had no clue what I was missing the whole time! To start off with, Jeanie (I think that's her name) was super awesome! I didn't ask, but I think she is the manager. She's super welcoming with a sense of humor, lol. She told us that everything was homemade there. And yes, it did taste like she was telling the truth!  The tangerine lemonade is to die for, seriously. I had the meatloaf sandwich and my gf had a different sandwich and soup. They also seem to be known for their Quiche! It has got to be the best thing they have to offer, beside their customer service! I will find myself here at least a few more times before I move!   If you're in the area, and you're looking to try a new place that you won't be disappointed with...please take the time to give this little place a shot. Its small so chances are...you wont have to worry about a crowd. It has an awesome quiet atmosphere with some art hanging up (I would love to have my photos hung up in there)! This place honestly blows most out the water.   Try the Quiche (green chile) and Tangerine Lemonade on you're first visit!"}
{"text":"I don't think I can give enough compliments about this place.  We just moved from out of state to Chandler a few weeks ago and have been there 3 times.  We knew we found a special place a few moments after we arrived.  We were warmly greeted by the owner and all the staff behind the counter.  After a quick tour of the menu, and some suggestions from a couple of the regulars, we found ourselves ordering soups, salads, and sandwiches...and some of the best lemonade I have ever enjoyed.    The tomato basil soup and the meatloaf sandwich have been my favorites so far.  Did I mention their lemonade is ridiculous?  I am told they are known for their quiches, but I have yet to try one - definitely will sample one for my next visit b/c they do look/smell awesome.  Their vegetarian sandwich also was spot on...I had that with the chicken tortilla soup.  My kids really enjoyed the egg salad sandwiches and my wife has had a couple of their salads.    During our last visit, we were treated to several of their sweet pastries (lemon bar & mixed berry scone) after my son set our table, brought our food and drinks to the table, and bussed the table after we were done."}
{"text":"I love to find a locally own restaurant. Nothing beats it! The owners of this delightful cafe are friendly and kind, as well as great cooks! The food is amazing. I have loved everything I've had there, from the quiche to the soup to the delicious lemonades, and for a treat, the scones.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable. Amazing service and owners that really care. I had the soup and sandwich special. The chicken cordon bleu sandwich was great and the strawberry lemonade was super fresh. This is a great local business to support.  Definitely worth a stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you have 20 minutes to spare at lunch during the week and you haven't been here, you're messing up.  You really should get the quiche but if that's too heavy for lunch then their soup and salad are both excellent too. We had the tomato basil soup and Greek salad AND learned that tomato is a fruit.   The people who work here are super friendly and made us feel completely at home. Jeanie convinced us to try a lemon bar before we left and now I won't ever leave without one."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, friendly staff. A bit pricey but the quality is worth it. Wish they were open on weekends!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Took me way too long to find this place. Some of the freshest tastiest made from scratch with Love food in Chandler!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. A little pricey maybe, but everything was homemade and delicious. Will definitely be back to try some of the homemade pies and desserts.   We tried the meatloaf sandwich, a meat chili, a green chili quiche, zucchini pasta soup, and fresh squeezed tangerine/lemonade and it was all excellent!"}
{"text":"I ordered `the` half sandwich/salad combo. I got the chicken salad and greek salad. Very generous portions of both. Salad fixings and sandwich tasted very fresh. Excellent service too. They mad a nice little plate of fruit and bread for my picky toddler and brought it out immediately, which was so nice. Must try their strawberry lemonade! So good and not too sweet and tasted all natural."}
{"text":"I am very stingy with my 5 star reviews and this place 100% deserves it.  The food is amazeballs!  Personal favorites are the green chile quiche (which I am hesitant to recommend to anyone else because it's always in danger of running out!), meatball sandwich and their desserts.  I usually get the sandwich or quiche with the side garden salad and the dressing they put on there is magical.  Just the right combo of oil/acid/seasonings that isn't too heavy and goes perfectly with the greens and tomatoes.  Oh and it comes with a slice of their glorious homemade bread.  The owners of the place are super nice and if you are a regular they may give you tastes of their new desserts on the house.  How can you go wrong there?!  The lemon bars are superb but my favorite so far is the apple crisp.  I am a serious crisp fan and this one is just right, apples aren't mushy and the crisp topping is just the right texture and doesn't overwhelm the apples.  Yum!  I brought my pickiest friend a sandwich from here (I'm sure you have one, it's the friend that takes 5 min to order because she's changing everything about what comes with her dish) and she was raving about it.  Kudos Cornucopia!  If it was slightly cheaper I'd probably eat there 3x a week!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary...I can't get enough of Cafe Cornucopia. They are located in a bit of a independent restaurant food desert so anything would be good but they are beyond good...they are GREAT (sorry General Mills, I couldn't resist!).   I am a huge lunch and chat to random strangers fan...maybe you do the same? It makes lunch so much fun and Cafe Cornucopia has just the right bar, food and company to make that happen. You can head straight to the bar and immediately feel like you have friends, which is rather awesome, especially with all the alone dining I do!   You will meet a lot of Intel folks (why do you keep asking for a discount...you WORK at Intel, not  members of the Royal Family and you make me wait when you ask these dumb questions) medical folks and I love your scrubs by the way and of course, every other business soul in a 5 mile radius.   Exceptional lunch choices would be the chicken salad, followed by the chicken salad, followed by the brownie. An A plus choice and thoroughly vetted multiple times by me!  The other exceptional choices would be the soups made fresh every day...I can eat soup in summer and love it. The ham sandwich, you can go hot or cold, I recommend the hot version.   And my ongoing love affair with the fresh squeezed lemonades should not be ignored, they too deserve a lot of recognition.   So, if you need a fabulous lunch and you are dining solo or with friends, I recommend Cafe Cornucopia, you will find me at the bar!"}
{"text":"I miss this place so much ! When I went here today the sign on the door said that this place had been sold"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....why didn't I stop here 2 years ago?? This place is fun, yummy, and just awesome. My family and I went here on a Friday afternoon. It's small and quaint...just perfect. I wish I remembered everyone's names because they remembered all of ours! They took time to go over all the menu items and even how they started the family business. Everything's homemade every morning. We had green chile quiche, chilli, broccoli cheddar soup, meatloaf sandwich, ham and cheese sandwich, and lemon bar. We don't have one complaint. Only wish that we came here years ago! They were taking orders for Thanksgiving pies which was awesome!!! They do custom pie orders too!! We will be back for sure. Oh yeah one complaint they aren't open on the weekend boo! LOL love this place and love Jeanine (hope I spelled it right)"}
{"text":"I tried half Vegetarian sandwich and cup of chicken noodle soup. Sandwich was extremely fresh and soup was good too. Mandarin lemonade was amazing too! A good find close to work."}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell you how much I love this place! The food is fabulous. Everything is made from scratch, and is so fresh. I dream about their salad dressing and their home made bread. Beyond the wonderful food are the owners Jeanie and Patty. Amazing women who know you by name and treat you like family. I highly recommend this place and everything on the menu. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"went there for lunch a few weeks ago when I was in the area.  Used other yelp reviews to pick the spot.  It was as advertised, excellent in all ways.  I got a warm, friendly greeting at the door and ended up with a quiche (broccoli) and some soup.  Both were ample portions and very well done.  I would highly recommend this spot for lunch.  Try the desserts -- they look delicious."}
{"text":"Not a 5 star experience for me - the greek salad and meatloaf sandwich i ordered were average (zero culinary expertise with either of these) and it was  pricey!!  The bread that came with the salad was good, as was the cookie , but I can not see myself coming back here.  Not a neighborhood 'gem' for me."}
{"text":"Based on the description from friends who love this place I was sure I wouldn't.  Menu on the chalkboard, order at the counter,  seat yourself.  Very basic service and seating.  I guess I'm a snob.  Luckily I'm open minded (most of the time) .  Ordered a meatloaf sandwich and soup and started noticing how well the owners were engaging the customers, making suggestions, being very welcoming without being fake or overbearing.  While waiting for the food and while eating it became apparent that there is a lot of return business here.  Camaraderie between everyone in front of and behind the counter.  The food was excellent, comforting, great portions for the price.  They had many vegetarian choices, about a half dozen different quiche, 3 or 4 soup choices,   quite a few sandwich selections.  Everything that was carried by the table looked great, the smoothies looked awesome.    Everything made from scratch, the kitchen is visible for everyone to see."}
{"text":"Love this place and really wish I could make it over more often! Everything I've had from there is so yummy, and the owner and staff are so friendly. I love the meatloaf sandwich, quiches, desserts, and flavored lemonades. The bread you get on the side with soup or quiche is so good, and the dressing on their salads is nice and light. Once, I brought a large group for lunch, and we were treated so well, and they brought out complimentary lemon squares and brownies for us all to sample. So good! Wish they'd extend their hours or open on weekends so I could come in more."}
{"text":"I never have written a review on Yelp, but the quality and the deliciousness of the food compelled me to write a review for this neighborhood cafe. The salads, sandwiches, baked goods, bread, and lemonade are of superior quality! All made in  house. Not to mention the friendly staff and owners who are always there helping prepare the quality cuisine! Go, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time I went here I was not sure what I wanted so they let me sample the soup and I was surprised by how both soups tasted they were very good the tomato basil was great their service is perfect and the food matches their service  they were nice enough to send me home with some extra soup with no extra charge I will be coming back"}
{"text":"We had a group of 17 for a week day lunch.  The staff and owners treated us as if we were out of town visiting relatives.  They arranged the seating so we could converse without being in that stiff long banquet configuration.  We had sandwiches, soup, salads, quiche and even the lemon squares.  We had it all.  Even the coffee was good.   All the food servings were generous and tasty but most notably every item was fresh and imaginative.  It is refreshing to see staff and owners dedicated to quality food and pleasant service.   Even the bread was homemade.  An all around satisfying experience"}
{"text":"Great service! The three women working and running the place are super friendly. The food is all made from scratch, a definite plus! I ordered a half turkey and cheese with avocado on whole grain wheat and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. The bread that came with the soup was buttered and slightly sweet. Delicious! She ordered the meatloaf sandwich. I had a bite. I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but this was good! We both had fresh lemonades, one strawberry one tangerine. Both great! We split a lemon bar, yum! We will be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad chest cold and was looking for some great homemade chicken soup! After looking thru Yelp I discovered Cafe Cornucopia. I don't know how I haven't been to this place yet? I called ahead and asked about the chicken soup, which they had, and when I walked in I was greeted playfully. One of my favorite things about this place is the feeling you get just walking in and meeting the wonderful ladies cooking and obviously running the place. It looks like they put two locations together the small cafe where they cook and make all sorts of deliciousness and an adjacent room where you can sit and be waited on by their cheerful staff. The chicken soup was perfect. Right amount of flavor (still came thru with my cold), filled with lots of white meat chicken, small shell pasta, carrots and seasoned really well. It hit the spot and i feel better already! I noticed some fresh baked lemon bars and thought I'd try one. I was not disappointed there either. Just the right amount of tart and sweet, the crust was perfect. I'll try to save some for my wife when she gets home from work. I'm looking forward to returning and trying some different dishes!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for the longest time and finally tried it with a friend from work on our lunch hour.  The staff was so friendly and welcoming - I tried the quiche Lorraine and loved it!  It was huge and I ate every bite.  The outside is nondescript which probably does not help attract customers but if you are in the neighborhood and looking for something besides fast-food I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Mozzarella and spinach quiche too cheesy. Mexican meatball soup was amazing. Meatloaf sandwich was good. Tangerine lemonade was really good. Freshly squeezed. Nice environment. Artwork on walls for sale."}
{"text":"Very good food, very nice service, fun place but a bit overpriced for what you get. The honey bread that came with the quiche was phenomenal as was the sweet potato, red pepper soup. The quiche was ok (my wife's is much better) and the meat loaf sandwich was good, but neither was spectacular. The ladies working that day were very friendly. Worth a try if you're considering it."}
{"text":"This place is SO good and tastes so fresh! Where has this been all my life I love it so much"}
{"text":"Mouth watering food, friendly and energetic customer service and overall fantastic experience. The food is delicious! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe with a homey atmosphere. Lunch was prepared in a clean open kitchen and tasted delicious! Thank you for such great hospitality."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews. The decor/environment didn't seem super promising, BUT THE FOOD IS AMAZING!  I had the spinach and mozzarella quiche with the zucchini soup and a peach lemonade.  The quiche was perfectly flaky and cheesy without being greasy/oily. The zucchini soup, to my surprise, was NOT cream based. It was like a greener chicken noodle soup with little star noodles cooked perfectly al dente. Love. Last but not least, the peach lemonade was super fresh tasting. I think they blended in actual peaches (not syrup), and it was genuinely lemony - tangy rather than sugary. It's so rare nowadays to get a drink that's not filled artificial flavors and overloaded with sugar, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Conclusion - unassuming place in a strip mall, but awesome food and service. Highly recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim. Cage Cornucopia did not disappoint. Me wife had the half sandwich, egg salad with split pea soup, and I had the manly meatloaf sandwich on marbled rye. We both decided on a strawberry flavored lemonade. Very, very good. Will definitely put this on our short list of inconspicuous places that are destined to be the place to be. Our first time there, but I'm sure a lot of others already know of it. Great people, awesome food - second to none."}
{"text":"Our party of four visited on a Saturday morning. Not a lot of breakfast choices as this appears to be more of a lunch place. There was a quiche option that two friends enjoyed. I was not feeling too hungry and asked for some of their home-baked bread with a bit of butter and jam. Simple request and the bread smelled heavenly. I asked how that sounded (since it wasn't on the menu) and the cashier replied, \"not too good.\" I wasn't sure what that meant. Still not sure. But the bread was absolutely delicious regardless. They had a nice selection of hot teas and one of my friends enjoyed her meatloaf sandwich immensely. If you're in the area, you may want to try them for lunch. The menu is a bit limited but tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped by today for a late lunch. First time here. The ladies behind the counter are very nice. You can tell they take pride in there business. It was very easy to find and well decorated and comfortable. I was not very hungry so just got the special, half sandwich and a small potato salad, the sandwich was very good and the potato salad was potato salad, I've had better and worse. The shocker for me was the price, $14+$1 tip for a half sandwich and an ice tea is a bit much for lunch.  Will i go back! maybe"}
