{"text":"Phaedra and Kerith are TOP NOTCH.  They welcomed my Mom and I into their shop, took extra time to work with us, were extremely efficient with their communication and in answering all of my bridey questions!  Their seamstress is a perfectionist and did an amazing job of making my dress fit like a glove.  The overall experience was magical, seamless, and stress free.  I drove an hour and a half from where I lived to make sure my wedding dress experience was with Classic Bride and Formals.  The shop and the ladies are perfection."}
{"text":"Great experience working with the team at Classic Bride! Found the perfect dress for my budget. They helped with the entire look from start to finish! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Classic Bride & Formals. This was the fourth place I visited in search of a wedding dress, and the experience here was by far the best of all. Amanda greeted me warmly when I arrived (and didn't even mind that I was 10 minutes early). She showed me around the beautiful collection of gowns they have, and gave me all the time I needed to explore on my own and select gowns to try on. She was patient as I went through close to 15 dresses, providing good feedback but also listening carefully to my own thoughts about each one. While I ended up really loving 3 gowns, there was one I had a strong gut feeling about, and I'm so happy to say I chose it for my wedding.   Throughout the entire process, there was never an ounce of pressure to buy, and the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of dresses and the designers featured. I ended up liking several dresses from the sale rack too, which had been marked down quite a bit. So you can likely find something for any budget.  Amanda was also extremely helpful in explaining the process of buying and then altering the gown. While it will be a few months before my dress is ready, I am already excited to go back to see Amanda and store owner Phaedra and work with their seamstress on my fittings.  I highly recommend the store to any bride!"}
{"text":"My daughter (from out of state) and I made several appointments at  bridal salons in the area.  Classic Bride was our final stop.  We were there less than 30 minutes and with the help of a very knowledgeable staff she found the dress of her dreams. Some alterations were needed but that also was handled with the utmost professionalism.  What a pleasure."}
{"text":"Less than zero star is what it deserves.  I live in the area and have passed by Classic Bride and Formal many times. I've seen the gowns they display outside their front porch and I've been curious about the store. That's right, I said front porch. This store is in a converted old and small house, with emphasis to small.  This year, we actually had a reason to go in the store because my daughter was looking for prom dresses. We did not want to go to department stores where they sell mass-produced gowns. When we walked in, the middle-aged woman at the front desk eyed us from head to toe and RUDELY asked if we had an appointment. I said no and I added that I didn't know I had to have appointment to walk in and browse for prom dresses (I totally understand if someone wants to try wedding gowns, yes, an appointment will be needed to ensure there's an assigned consultant. But for prom dresses?). She RUDELY said that they are already expecting people with appointments so there won't be any available dressing rooms. Without breaking a smile nor warmth, she coldly pointed to her right where the formal dresses are.   The room was very small and claustrophobic. With the dresses against the walls and a couple of racks in middle, there was hardly any room to walk around. My daughter and went around one time and I have to say with all honesty that the dresses were NOT anything to be desired, especially with prices of several hundred dollars. My daughter thought the dresses were very old fashioned. The room smelled like a grandmas attic. We left within five minutes because of the smell and the lack of air in the room.  Be warned, if you have claustrophobia, or don't have an appointment, do not waste your time here. You'll save yourself the experience of being eyed down by RUDE person. There are more professional boutiques close by with better selections and with lots of airy space."}
{"text":"This place and the associates/owner are great.  It's a cute house with a boutique feel.  The service is non pushy, helpful, encouraging and patient.  I live in Durham and my experience here has been so much better than anywhere else, that I'll be purchasing my bridal gown here despite the  long drive.  They have already gone above and beyond and I haven't even purchased my dress yet."}
{"text":"There aren't enough good words to describe this bridal store. I am the MOH for my sisters wedding in May. We had a unique situation going into the store today, as we are short on time and were mislead by a previous store. Kristi took control of the situation and helped us above and beyond what we could have expected. The fitting rooms are huge and private. They do not make the bride feel rushed, and overall we had a great experience. Thank you Kristi!"}
{"text":"Charlotte brides - do yourself a favor and add Classic Bride & Formals to the top of your list of dress shopping stops! Since I live South of town, CB&F wasn't on my radar at first. A friend of mine suggested that we make a stop there, and I couldn't be happier that I did for several reasons:  1) Selection: Not only does CB&F have an excellent selection in terms of variety of dresses / styles, they also have the best variety of price points and make no judgements about you based on your budget.  2) Atmosphere: Hands down the most laid back and pleasant of all the stops I made. I also loved their shop set-up the most. It's an adorable converted house right on the main street in Cornelius. Also, unlike other stores, you never felt like you were competing for attention from the staff. It's a very individualized experience. 3) People: Amanda & Phaedra are incredibly warm, welcoming and flexible. They go above and beyond to make the dress buying and fitting processes fun and memorable. 4) Seamstress / Alterations: Sharon is a GEM. She's incredibly honest and transformed my gown by creatively incorporating pieces of my mother's veil. Without her vision and talent, I would never have ended up with a truly unique dress of my dreams!  Classic Bride & Formals was such a special part of my wedding experience. They treat their brides like family, and I can't recommend them highly enough :)"}
{"text":"This was THE BEST service and experience I've had in shopping for my wedding gown. The Ladies were down to earth, very helpful and so kind. I love the shop's atmosphere and the upbeat, positive, warm hospitality vibes that fill the space. They were SO very helpful in my search for a dress. They have a great clearance selection of all sizes and styles. If you're shopping for a wedding dress this is the place to go and these people are the best people to work with. I highly recommend them!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible service! I had help from multiple staff and they were all so knowledgeable, kind and very helpful. They respected my budget and were not pushy. I had a great experience at this local shop and walked away with dress!"}
{"text":"Bringing it down to a 1 because I gave the store a fairly positive review with my only complaint being that the store DID NOT make the 25 dollar fee clear. The owner's hostile response leads me knock it down to a 1. I shopped at almost a dozen stores before I bought my gown and not ONE charged me except for Classic. I shopped in Charlotte, Charleston, and Atlanta at super tiny boutiques and larger stores. No other store, including the small boutiques, charge to try on wedding gowns. There are so many other bridal salons and \"boutiques\" in the area that one doesn't need to waste their time (and money) at this place."}
{"text":"We stopped by here about a month ago without an appointment. The young lady up front, was very pleasant and welcoming to us. This boutique is in a cute house on Main Street in Cornelius, NC. They carry Allure, Maggie Sottero and Essence of Australia, to name a few. I looked around and tried on a couple of gowns. While I was trying on gowns, the young lady asked for my name, address, wedding date, and phone number. As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm not too fond of giving out my information, but she was so nice and helpful, I thought why not since most other places had asked for this information, as well. She also never mentioned this fee for trying on dresses that Jennifer mentioned in an earlier review. I liked two of the dresses I tried so she took down the information for me on card. A couple days later I received a thank-you card in the mail. Most businesses don't do this anymore. I use to do this as a hairstylist.. This really impresses me and is a great way to earn my business. Sending a thank-you card showed me that the boutique is willing to go the extra mile for the customer, which means a lot when you are entrusting someone with your wedding dress.   I stopped back by last week to look at bridesmaids dresses and I believe I spoke to the owner, who was also very friendly. I didn't see anything that stuck out at me but she let me know they could order any dress they had in a different color. I also told her I was still looking for a wedding dress. She showed me around some more and told me I could come back in and try on more dresses when I had more time. I'd really like to find my dress at this boutique. Unfortunately, I haven't found anything that had the wow factor of a dress I tried on in Charlotte. I'll likely stop back by this fall as they will probably get more dresses in as the season changes."}
{"text":"The team at Classic Bride & Formals went above and beyond my expectations for finding my wedding dress! From their quick responses to helping me find the perfect dress, I always felt listened to, appreciated, and respected. After trying on a few dresses, my maid of honor and I found one that neither of us were crazy about because of the colors but decided to try it on anyway. Kristy immediately told me that the dress came in different colors! Although Venus Bridal did not have any pictures of the dress in the ivory/ivory option, Classic Bridal helped piece together a \"vision\" to help ease my mind with choosing a dress that I hadn't really seen. When the dress came in, we were all IN LOVE!! So pleased and happy with all of the help at Classic Bridal!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried on gowns twice with two different consultants, and had a wonderful experience each time. The ladies were patient and helpful in suggesting beautiful gowns that I missed when going through the racks. The location is easy to find, and parking is easy. I highly recommend that you visit Classic Bride when you are searching for your dream dress!"}
{"text":"Unique shop where you're allowed to look through the racks and pick your favorites. The sales lady who helped us referred to the dresses as women (\"Oh that's Delores, she's new here\") but she was incredibly nice and followed up with me days after my appointment."}
{"text":"I had such a great time at Classic Bride! Amanda was our consutant and she was amazing, very warm and knowledgeable! They have cute little decorated private rooms for you and your entourage and a great selection of dresses for any type of wedding. Would definitely recommend you visit them if you're looking for a wedding dress :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommended! I found my beautiful wedding dress the first day and the staff there was phenomenal which made the experience of wedding dress shopping even better. You get individual attention, they listen to your concerns, and also make you feel so special as a future bride! If I had to do it all over again I would. The person I worked with the majority of the time was Kristy and she has a heart of gold. She made this experience incredible for me. Even after the purchase of the dress she was so accommodating. Allowing fittings even after hours bc of my complicated work schedule and steaming the dress the day before to make sure everything was perfect! I will never forget Kristy and Classic Bridal, all so influential in the whole process!  I recommend over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"This is a charming place! I got my wedding dress here and they went out of their way to make sure I had the best experience. The name holds true as they carry truly beautiful, classic pieces. The space is a little small so if you have many bridesmaids make sure you call ahead for proper space accommodations."}
{"text":"Living in Cornelius, you drive by Classic Bride and Formals all the time.  It looked very quaint.  I am in my mid 40's, newly engaged and was hoping to purchase my wedding gown from a local company.  I tried a few other boutiques in the area and was surprised how either extremely expensive the dresses were (10k+) or how unpleasant the folks helping me try to find a dress were.  That is when I decided to try Classic Bride.  I wandered into the store on a random Thursday afternoon, no appointment made or advertisement that I was coming in.  From the moment you walk into the store it is charming.  An old home converted into a bridal shop.  Rheva greeted me when I walked in and we discussed the wedding details.  She was amazing from the start.  I had a limited amount of time that day to try on dresses.  Rheva helped me get right into it.  We discussed my style and I shared the pinned dressed I preferred.  While I was picking dresses I liked, Rheva was also picking out styles that she thought would flatter my figure and style.  The dressing rooms (2) are two old rooms of the house.  They are setup perfect to try on gowns.  We found two dressed I loved in less than an hour.  I had tried on at least 30 before without a gown really feeling like the 'one'.  There was also no pushiness or arrogance to the team at Classic Brides.  I made an appointment to come back a few days later and try on a few more gowns.  I found the \"one\" at Classic Brides.  The team of folks, the personal experience, the quality make of the dresses and the down to earth prices made this bridal shop the right one for me.  If you want big box and non personal experience, go elsewhere for sure.  If you want a great, personal, experience Classic Bride is the place for wedding gown shopping."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I experienced bridal shopping. I was greeted promptly given a beverage and escorted to pick out my dresses. They have two rooms one where you can buy off the rack and another for orders. It was a nice selection though not quite as huge as others. I was never charged a $25 fee and she clearly explained to me that they only charge when you do a package where you can receive champagne, chocolate etc.  if you're bringing a group to shop with you.   My one tiny complaint was that the girl who was my guide was extremely quiet and timid - she didn't clamp the dresses properly (tightly) to give me an idea of what the dress would be like in my size- and most of the ones I tried on were far too big. I would also have preferred someone who spoke up a little more just because my apt. was directly after work and I had to shop by myself so I needed some suggestions etc.   I will say on a whole the ladies there were so nice and there were others there that were super helpful and so I might go back to order my dress through them. I felt their prices were fair, and I had no issues finding dresses in the 1000-1500 range"}
{"text":"I must admit, I wasn't looking forward to wedding dress shopping. I had no idea what I wanted and the whole experience felt very overwhelming. Luckily for me...I happened to meet Kristy and she invited me to Classic Bride. Thank goodness I listened! She made the whole experience effortless! She is so pleasant and fun! She told me that she had ESP for picking out bridal gowns and I believe her! After trying on a few gorgeous gowns...she brought me the perfect dress! Like magic! Every time I stopped in during my wedding planning, she offered to help in any way she could. She took the time to make my daughter feel equally as important as she fit her super adorable flower girl dress. She even suggested the perfect caterer! I would strongly recommend Classic Bride for their beautiful selection, fair pricing, and most importantly... for the delightful experience of working with Kristy!"}
{"text":"Wow I was so spoiled by Tara at Classic Bride and formals . I will be wearing a lovely dress as I walk down the isle . I had so much fun with family trying on about 15 different dresses. It turned out to really make me feel like a spoiled princess. I'd highly recommend this lovely quaint and elegant establishment to everyone. I felt beautiful even with my 10 extra pounds of winter weight on . There were no high pressure sales and Tara took the time to send me a person note card. Check out my photos. It was an afternoon to die for. Congratulations to all the brides out there. Tara will take wonderful care of you. I met the owner too. She was very kind , helpful, and beautiful."}
