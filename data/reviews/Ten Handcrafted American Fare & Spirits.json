{"text":"What a wonderful find! - although it was a challenge to find in the midst of a movie theater and office complex. Fortunately, a friendly security officer in a golf cart directed us. We ended up arriving after happy hour ended but when we explained our difficulties the delightful waitress gave us a round of drinks and appetizers at happy hour prices. As a kid, I did not like Mom's fried green tomatoes so I have no idea why I love them as an adult - and Ten does them right, along with yummy shrimp and andouille sausage with grits. We barely had room for an entree but were glad we split the fried chicken (absolutely not greasy) with mash & gravy. Just like Sunday dinner when I was growing up. How long has it been since we allowed ourselves to stray from the straight and narrow path of health? Boy, this is the place to do it!  We just loved it - along with all those terms of endearment from our endearing waitress.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I am just speechless! ! I went for lunch...my boyfriend and I for a 2:30pm reservation.  We were immediately seated by our waiter Jody (spell check). She was just pure awesome-sauce... just delightful and her glasses were super ca-yute!!! The chef introduced himself to us, thanked us for coming and gave us instructions on how to make reservations for upstairs.  We had shrimp & grits and fried green tomatoes-delish!  Will be my new spot"}
{"text":"The food is the best I've had in Arizona. It's all phenomenal. The drinks are...generous. Really cool atmosphere. Will be back here frequently."}
{"text":"Walked in pretty late, and I haven't even looked at the drink menu yet, but I felt like Rumchada and coffee. Turns out they didn't carry the bottled stuff, so they made it for me from scratch! It was outstanding! (they should really consider putting it this concoction of their's on the menu). I took a little sip, then poured it into my coffee. Wow! We ordered the Hush Puppies and the large fries. Both were excellent, but I'll probably be dreaming of those Hush Puppies until my next chance to visit!  Jeff and his team made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in, to the moment HE walked us out."}
{"text":"Great food. Cute place. Fun atmosphere.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"The service was some of the best I've experienced in a while, very attentive and quick.  Had high expectations for the food but definitely did not walk away wow'd.  Stopped in with some friends just before happy hour ended and ordered all the apps at half price.  They were ok but can't say any of them would bring me back.  Beef tacos were pretty good except for the tortillas which tasted like grocery store ones that have been sitting on a shelf for a while. Pot roast was pretty awesome and hand cut steak was really good.  Would not order the cuban sandwhich again, really lacked any of the delicious flavors I was expecting.  The spinach and green apple salad, meh."}
{"text":"All right.  Just checked out Yelp for this place and two of the more recent reviews gave it 3 stars.  Are you serious?  This place is as good as it gets.  And I say that as a regular who's been here at least 10 times, mostly for client meetings but also for just a chill time with good friends.  Consistently awesome.  There's a few reasons I keep coming here, which I will go into detail.  1) The staff is consistently exceptional.  Pretty much everyone there is friendly and chatty, not in a weird superficial way, but because they actually like people.  In a real, significant way.  I mean, when you go into most restaurants, you never quite know... sometimes the hostess or waitresses have a bad day or are just boring or something, but not here.  All of the people here really take pride in their craft.  2) Speaking of that, this starts at the top.  Jeff, the owner and chef, routinely comes out to make sure all of the food etc is up to everyone's standards.  I mean, who does that?    3) The food is also consistently good and at times excellent.  I haven't had one bad meal here, and more often than not have been amazed at the quality of the food.  Everything's thought out, including the specials (the Po' Boy was unbelievable, I hope that becomes a menu item).  4) Lastly it's an unassuming place.  The decor is nice but not over the top, and even the menu basically just lists the ingredients in a totally boring font (http://tenfareandspirits.com/TenLunch1_15.pdf).  Not a pretentious place at all, which is even more impressive considering it's located right in the middle of Biltmore.  Anyway I don't write too many Yelp reviews but these guys have consistently delivered an excellent experience every single time I've walked in.  I can't think of another restaurant that I feel the same about or even similar about (maybe Hillstone, which is also a great bar but a very different vibe), but the wait staff at Ten is literally the best staff I have ever seen at a restaurant.  But yeah!  Awesome place, very happy it's here in Phoenix.  We are so lucky that this restaurant is around, most cities don't have a place like Ten."}
{"text":"On our first excursion we checked out Happy Hour, and worked our way through too many appetizers and never got to the main event. That will have to wait. The hush puppies were a worthwhile indulgence, brown and crispy outside and steamy and fluffy inside. The shrimp and grits lived up to expectations...we ordered it twice, if that's a clue. The chop salad featured iceberg lettuce, a tip of the hat to the midwestern influence! The fish tacos are designed to satisfy a hearty eater, with flour tortillas heaped with generous hills of lightly dusted flash-fried fish. Order the beef tacos if you want taste of the slow-cooked pot roast meat, and you won't be disappointed. Next time we'll move over to the right side of the menu and get serious. Whether there will be room for dessert remains to be seen. That might have to be its own event."}
{"text":"My son and I came in on a weeknight and the restaurant was about half-full (it was packed by the time we left). We had a couple of problems at the beginning which involved a lost drink order, and an appetizer that had be re-started from scratch which resulted in us just sitting there for quite a stretch. To our amazement, one of the co-owners took the bull by the horns, solved the problems and made things right. You don't see that very much in restaurants anymore. That behind us, the dinner was fantastic. Superb craft cocktails, the hush puppies everyone raves about, and probably the best Cuban sandwich and Pulled Pork sandwich you'll ever have. And do yourself a favor and substitute the homemade chicken soup for the french fries. You won't be sorry! Will absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was exceptional. Cocktails were great- must try the pisco sour. Favorite dish was the pork shoulder, it is actually perfect and melts in your mouth we barely had to cut it- it was that tender. Great service and vibe. Love!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience from entering the door to paying our bill. The food was wonderful with great choices and the cocktails were exceptional. Overall highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than this!  Visiting from Nashville and went with a large group from all over the country. There is something for everyone here. The pot roast with mashed potatoes and carrots is not to be missed. The grouper was fabulous. Service was top-notch, and the evening was topped off by a visit from Jeff, the chef/owner. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Five star service, drinks and food! Done perfectly with care by the Chef - who by the way will make sure your meal is perfect. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The place is adorable and cool. The staff was sweet and attentive. The cocktails delicious and the food was tasty and seasoned to perfection. I can't wait to eat my leftovers!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to spend a time with your loves! Bring friends or family and you wont be disappointed! This is is worse to spend time in there"}
{"text":"My first time at Ten and it didn't disappoint.   Staff was great. Owner Jeff was front and center greeting and attending to every detail. The bar was outstanding and the food even better.   A little tough to find with some construction going on but park in AMC movie lot and you'll find the place."}
{"text":"I came here while in town on business. I sat at the bar by myself. Great atmosphere. Amazing food. Even more amazing staff. The bartender (Jodi) was such a delight. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Second review I have ever written.  Chef Ten is amazing.  Interactive with his customers.  We were debating between Pork Shoulder & Steak and eventually went with steak...(which was awesome) but he brought us out a sample of the Pork to try.  Unreal experience will absolutely repeat next time in town."}
{"text":"We're from out of town and went to dinner after reading yelp reviews No knife needed for the tasty pot roast with fresh veggies T bone special was excellent  Great atmosphere and service!!!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you about the food or drinks here - we didn't stay long enough to get to that part. It wasn't busy when we got there, that wasn't the reason. I work in customer service and the first minute always sets the mood for the experience. In this case, when we were told to sit anywhere, we wanted to go upstairs. The waiter serving complained to us that we shouldn't sit upstairs - she didn't want to walk all the way up there just to give us water, she said. She didn't seem very happy to have us sit anywhere in general. My dad is an easygoing guy, and this really upset him. Even my brother told me when we decided to sit by a window, \"Is she still going on about it?\"  We sat for maybe a minute before the vibe just really killed the great experience we were hoping for. The first minute really sets the mood in customer service, and this case, it drove us away."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my wife and 3 friends, and it was amazing. The food was absolutely delicious, the drinks  and the service were fast and great. The owner and head chef Jeff came out and visited with us. I definitely recommend TEN."}
{"text":"Great food (get the pot roast).  Great drinks and awesome service. Also a beautiful and cozy restaurant. Shrimp and cake was a bit too spicy"}
{"text":"After searching on Yelp for nearby restaurants we came across this gem tucked away in the Biltmore Esplanade. What a wonderful experience. The owner Jeff was the epitome of what a owner/chef should be. Extremely kind and went above and beyond explaining the menu. The food was phenomenal! Highly suggest the hush puppies and BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Last but certainly not least, the ambiance is on point. Quaint, intimate, with a hint of old world charm...perfect setup for Tinder dates :)"}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely spot on and I loved the ambiance. The $5 house white wine was yummy which was a nice plus. The chef even came over and was super nice- asking us how we liked everything! Our whole group really enjoyed everything we got, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the cuban sandwich- it was a little dry. I'll order something else next time.   Note: The fries are delicious!! We were obsessed with the aioli they serve and the chef was nice enough to bring us some extra."}
{"text":"This restaurant had 5 stars and it was close to the theater so we thought we'd try it. It did not disappoint!  The shrimp/sausage/corn cake appetizer was amazing. I had the pot roast entree and my daughter has the fish. Both we prepared is a classic way and were absolutely delicious!  The service was top notch too. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a great find.  We were going to a party in the area and wanted to grab dinner first.  Saw the great reviews so we gave it a try.  We live 30 min north so didn't know where to go. Great menu, great atmosphere and really nice people. Everything we had was fantastic.  Hush puppies, soup, fish tacos and a burger. And it's an \"Oh my God\" burger. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I went to ten and I have to say the reviews were correct ... First I want to thank the chef John for a great meal and the waitress for being a great worker.... The place is beautiful and inviting and for couples for sure me and my husband had a great time and enjoy are time... I want to say also thanks to the chef he toke time out his busy schedule to fix are table because it was shaking and he himself find that unacceptable .... I would tell everyone one to go.. I had the chop salad, roasted pork shoulder, and fired green tomatoes all of this was the best I ever tasted , the drinks was all yummy .....  I would say everyone should go because I'm going back again.... Happy New Year"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  Excellent food and ambience!!! Came here 40 mins before a movie at the esplanade and the hostess told us that seating was full and there was a 20 min wait.  We knew we wouldn't make it to the movie in time with that kind of wait, so we left.  Seconds later the owner came running out to let us know he had a table for two available and we were seated immediately!  We had a delicious dinner and drinks with enough time to relax before the movie started!!!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Definitely try the pork shoulder and fried green tomatoes!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was outstanding! Our server, Jake, had great recommendations on beer, food and was fun to talk to! He made our time there into more of an experience than just a meal and drinks. I wish I lived closer because it would easily be my go to spot! Definitely try the hush puppies! I'll be back to try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped here for lunch one day and we were greeted by the chef/owner, who you could tell loved what he did. The food was amazing (hush puppies, fish tacos and cordon bleu sandwich) and drinks were delicious as well.  The atmosphere is very cool and makes you want to hang out and relax.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"The absolute best home cooked food in a sea of chain food! The nicest staff and owner!"}
{"text":"Ten is a charming small restaurant.  We were there with friends and all of us enjoyed our food, which was excellent.   I have special dietary needs, which they graciously met.  I had salmon with spinach, onions and green beans.  My husband had chop salad with salmon and our friends had a spinach salad with salmon and a burger with fries.   Portions were generous.  The staff is friendly.   It was a great experience and we plan to go there again, especially since the food was so good!  Update:  We had dinner at Ten again on 11-5, this time with our son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter.   I had made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we arrived, in the location I had requested.  The staff were welcoming and friendly and remembered my name.  I was amazed that when I started to remind the waitress of my food restrictions, she said that the chef remembered me and already knew what I needed.  The food was delicious and presented beautifully, again with generous portions, and the service was very good.   My husband and I ended up ordering what we had previously.  Our son had a wedge salad, our daughter-in-law had soup and fish tacos and our granddaughter had a hamburger with fries.  We were all very happy with our choices.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"INSANELY GOOD. I have been to a lot of food places in Phoenix and this tops the list. My friend for dinner and she had the excellent pot roast and I had the mouth watering fried chicken. The customer service was phenomenal and the food hand crafted and run by an amazing chef who visited with his guests the whole time. You must visit!!!!!  Also go check out his other restaurant dieci which is just across the way! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Albeit hard to find, the food more than made up for it IMO.  I ordered the pressed Cuban and it did not disappoint.   My wife ordered the roasted pork shoulder, the pork was crazy tender.  My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich, it was delicious.  My son had the cordon bleu sandwich and it was delicious as well.  The portions are large and the service was nice and efficient.  Drove an hour to come here and it was worth it."}
{"text":"I visited store.  they have Great service and personnel. ..I love it there!!"}
{"text":"After going to the sister restaurant, Dieci, the previous night, we were, again, greeted warmly by both the wait staff and chefs. We ordered the shrimp and grit cake and fried green tomatoes to start. They were delicious and quite authentic, as we are from the South! For our main dishes, we had the fried chicken and the pork shoulder. Both were healthy portions and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended! On our next trip to Phoenix, we will surely return to Ten!"}
{"text":"Get the special! No matter the day or the plate, it's always unique and delicious. I've never had a bad experience here (despite countless visits). Service is top notch no matter how busy it gets and food is always amazing. Great spot for lunch, happy hour, and dinner. The chef clearly puts a lot of time and effort into making delicious plates, as the atmosphere is cozy and trendy."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and great food here!I love the Shrimp & Gritcake,I think they are unique and so did my friends!! I'll be back sometime."}
{"text":"Cute little place -- felt like I was in a pub in England or something. Great date night spot. The service was great. The hush puppies were amazing. My only regret was not ordering more. The menu is hearty but the servings won't leave you overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Chef Brian Feirstein is truly a chef. He sources from local farmers markets, has fresh and innovative cocktail drinks made by real bartenders and allows for a casual yet intimate experience. Definitely make a point to stop in here...you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"What a find!  Great environment. The food and service were amazing. Three of the four of us had Chillean sea bass;the other had pot roast. We all raved about everything we had--including fried green tomatoes as appetizers. The desserts--brownie ganache and PBJ with ice cream were very good. The owner, Jeff, came out himself to serve us. Even though we didn't have reservations, they very hospitably accommodated us. Wonderful experience. Wish we lived in Phoenix so we could be regulars."}
{"text":"First, I would give 5 stars if there were more vegetarian options (common problem I've learned to accept) but the hush puppies are so crispy and delicious that I make it my meal every time.   It's a wonderful spot tucked away in the Esplanade, across from Merc Bar. My husband visits weekly for the Cuban sandwich and soup and is never disappointed.   However- The Best part of Ten is sitting at the bar while Jodie is working. She truly is in her element and her unique personality and humor always make for a great visit.  Any Gin drinkers out there? You MUST try Monkey 47, which I've only seen offered at a few restaurants throughout the valley. As far as gin goes, nothing beats a monkey47 and tonic."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, decent drinks, fun service. I've always found the space a bit odd for a restaurant but it is quirky."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Wait staff was incredible. Food was amazing. The chef came out several times to check on us! Wonderful gem of a restaurant. Brought our 2 yr old boy and was very welcomed by all. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for a drink, apps or full dinner. We had it all! The hush puppies were to die for and the mojito rocked! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere in restaurant is great, simple yet inviting. We sat at the bar, bartender was very nice and attentive. Fish taco appetizer was great! Ordered chicken cordon blue  sandwich for entree. Very good, juicy chicken, toasted bread, awesome french fries!  Met the chef/owner, nice guy a wanted to make sure we enjoyed our meal.   Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"The food was cold when served. And the taste is just mundane. The environment was nice though"}
{"text":"Ten does not disappoint! Everything from the appetizers to the dessert were delicious. You could taste the high quality ingredients that were used.  If you are thinking about going to Ten, no need to think about it... go there now! We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Fabulous little place to try!  The drinks were amazing and the hush puppies were great to start with. The pot roast was absolutely tremendous. Can't wait to go back and try more!!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after our first destination did not work out. The food was great, but like always, my girlfriends dish was way better than mine. She ordered the pot roast and I had the pork shoulder. I really felt like taking her plate while she wasn't looking. Also had a couple of drinks.  Anyway, I would put this on your list of restaurants to explore if you are looking for new places to check out."}
{"text":"Great find in Phoenix... Good selection of beer... Try the Dogfish 61.  The waitress took the time to guide us to a great Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, Rosita's.  Try the stuffed hush puppy appetizer sprinkled with blue cheese and bacon crumble... Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and wanted to try a new restaurant, so I was excited to find a new restaurant in the esplanade     The menu is brief, but their food is outstanding.   The entrees are straight forward American dishes with a southern flare.  I got the pulled pork and the gf ordered the pot roast, both were delicious.   The waitress seemed like it was her first waiting job.  She didn't pour the wine how they are supposed to-letting the guy taste and approve then pouring the females glass.  She also seemed a little nervous/uncomfortable.  But, whatever, not a big deal.   The chef/owner did personally come out and greet all the customers.  It was a really nice personal touch, and it's always nice to see someone taking pride in their business.    Overall a great experience, I would like to see an expanded menu in the future, but certainly nothing wrong with offering what you make best"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!!! Made last minute reservations and expectations were exceeded!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  Iceberg Salad   fish and chicken a la king.  Best meal in a long time Very reasonable. Highly recommended   You will love it"}
{"text":"I took my clients to lunch here. The server was excellent, atmosphere was upscale feel and the food was perfectly prepared. Fresh, comfort food with a southern twist. Creative presentation with the cake pans, I recommend the BBQ pork. The chef was present throughout our meal and ensured we were satisfied not rushed but ensured a quick lunch meal so we could get back to work. It's a hidden secret for sure. The five stars are 100% accurate."}
{"text":"First, the staff was very welcoming, kind, and on-top of their game. The cocktails and beer selection was great. The food was delicious! We recommend the hush puppies for appetizer. Second, the atmosphere was comfortable, clean, and hipster chic! The music wasn't loud and pleasant. I can't say enough regarding the excellent quality of this place. Highly recommend if in Phoenix. Visiting from WY, we will revisit if we ever find ourselves back in this city."}
{"text":"5-Stars is an understatement! Great spirits and energy...and top-notch service! I am vegetarian and they (often) will get crafty based on my dietary needs and never seize to amaze! The staff are like friends you just haven't yet met! Flipping LOVE this place! To boot, I brought my bestie from Chicago and she ate 3 orders of their hush puppies all by herself b/c she was in heaven!"}
{"text":"We dined at Ten this evening to a very warm restaurant. The food was not as good as previous visits, water glass was not refilled, and service was marginal. I'm assuming it was an off night, and hope this trend does not continue. Honestly, folks......turn down the thermostat!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat before movie. We tried both the specials of the night, sea bass and steak with blue cheese sauce. Both were very good."}
{"text":"Very few places garner 5 stars. When I see people giving 5 stars I sometimes wonder. Well...don't wonder. This is an incredible gem in Phoenix. People were not kidding about how friendly everyone is. They really make feel at home here.   The food!! OMG. It is awesome. I had the pork shoulder and my wife had the bbq salmon. Both were simply amazing. I had collared greens that made me want to have them every day. Jeff was also very gracious too. You simply have to come here."}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews, we decided to give Ten a try and were not disappointed. We were warmly welcomed by Jeff, the owner and chef, who showed us to our table. The menu was interesting and the prices perfect. We loved the hush puppies and BET salad we shared. My pork shoulder and my wife's pot roast were amazing. Beautifully presented and great tasting. We ended the meal w pineapple upside down butter cake. Wow...we loved it.  Jodi (sp?) our server was delightful and gave us great menu tips. We will definitely be back. The ambiance/decor and overall atmosphere were just right."}
{"text":"We were early for happy hour so decided to try everything on the happy hour menu.  The drinks are wonderful. All are very tasty with distinct flavors.  All were outstanding.   The hush puppies, shrimp and tacos were spectacular.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Good drinks. The steak and fries... They could change a little more for that flavor explosion. Great place to kick back and chat with a bartender. The menu is small but that only means they can focus intimately on the food they are cooking. It shows with every delightful bite. Also I know these fries... Damn, cooked to perfection. And I admire a good fry."}
{"text":"Edited review, gave one more star after owner contacted me and asked how he could make things right. Refunded dinner. Great customer service right there!  We went here (Dec 2016) because of all the great reviews, but there was nothing memorable or stand out about it in our opinion. Fish tacos, good... pot roast, tender, but standard flavors, nothing \"wow\". Nothing stood out to say, \"I have to come back here!\" Service was tipping the scale to satisfactory. Waitress was nice, slightly over the top with sharp personality and sense of humor. Took a while to get service and the place was very empty (although she did say she was working a party upstairs, must have been a very quiet party because I couldn't even see or hear them). Food came out warmish not hot. Not impressed. Had a strange, fake-sweet smell to the place which was not appealing when you're excited to eat savory fare. A few businessmen/women in there on a Tuesday at 6pm. a little hard to find, felt like we were walking into an office building not an eatery. Would give 2.5 stars if halves were an option. Had high hopes, I'm sure there are some really great items on the menu that we didn't experience. I'm also sure that the chef has a real heart for food.... we just didn't experience it that night."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem!  Great cocktails, bartender knows his biz, ambiance is spot on.  Ask about all the hidden drinks, food etc."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great small restaurant! Wonderful service, food, cocktails, and atmosphere. The chef was very personable and offered suggestions. All the food was delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Simple food done well. You might look at the menu and think that these are common American food, and how much better could the appetizer of shrimp and grits with sausage be than anywhere else -- the answer is, quite a bit. You might wonder how hushpuppies could get five stars, especially from someone like me who thinks that hushpuppies are from a bygone era when people began the road to obesity -- eat these and you will beg for more. You might think the chicken sounds like something mom made, until you eat it and realize that you have not lifted your head to speak to anyone in the crowd because you are hoping that no one will ask for a sample. You might think - ok, another steak place on the Camelback corridor - and then realize that this is amazing. Or you might think that the chicken soup could not be that great, until you taste it and realize that the next time you catch a cold you will be asking for a gallon or two of this. Then there is the peanut butter and jelly dessert - which people will cut you for if you try to sneak a bite.  The root beer (alcohol) float is not too sweet and perfect. The cocktails- oh just try them - hand crafted and delicious. Do not be fooled by the menu - go here, enjoy it."}
{"text":"Good staff and great atmosphere in a cool space. The food is good and I love a good beer menu. They even got their hands on Pumpkin Porter. I think we will make it a point to get to the movies early now and have a bite and a drink at Ten first."}
{"text":"Wow! Just had an amazing meal here and can't wait to go back.  The service was phenomenal (shout out to Jake!) and the food was out of this world. The pot roast and pulled pork sandwich were amazing and if we could have licked our plates, we would have. The dessert special was a mint brownie with ice cream which was also delicious and did not disappoint. Ten is a little hard to find (first time here) and it's tucked away (park in the Visitor Parking garage and follow the purple signs to the restaurants. Ten will validate your parking ticket). Well worth finding it! Can't wait to go back and try something else!! Props to the chefs and staff....you knocked it out of the park!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I strongly recommend this restaurant for both couples and large groups.  Jeff is a gracious chef and host..."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this gem during a two-day trip to Phoenix. Although it's in a peculiar spot (parking garage then short walk to a shopping area), it was our best meal in Phoenix.  - The atmosphere was fantastic...not too big, not too small.  The music (folksy) was just down my alley. - Happy Hour - we got there right as happy hour was ending, but our waiter slid our order in.  We got the hushpuppies (right on!!), shrimp and grit cake, and fried green tomatoes...I would rate them in that order.   - We finished the meal out with the PB&J ala mode - AWESOME!    Overall, it was a great atmosphere, with a superb wait staff, efficient service and a laid back environment.  We will be back if we're in Phoenix anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service got special attention from Jeff the chef/owner. Evan our server, was most acomodating & pleasent"}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets. Rarely does a yelp rating exceed expectation. Jeff's passion behind his restaurant and his food came out in every bite. The only disappointing part was i could not clean my plate with a piece of home made bread to catch every last drop of incredible flavors. Great job Jeff. Cheers to your success!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices. Great atmosphere.  Cozy place, good for conversations; adequately loud music :-). Which is a treat these days. My wife and I had the fried green tomatoes, braised beef tacos, shrimp and grits, and salad.  Wow! Holy amazingness.  For the happy hour price and quality of food, its a 6."}
{"text":"Dinner was great. Met the Chef: it is exciting to see someone passionate about what he does. Good food! Don't miss it."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch at this restaurant yesterday. The food was fantastic, the beer was great, and the service was exceptional. Jack M treated us like family...we will definitely be back and will tell our friends!!"}
{"text":"I find this place to be good but not great. I will admit that there craft beer selection is amazing. Whoever engineered the bottled beers they brought in, certainly knows their tuff. I've eaten here several times, ad I find the food to be lackluster in my mind but I wouldn't complain too much."}
{"text":"Great food. Cuban sandwich is the bomb. SUPER friendly staff. Good beer selection, both tap and bottle/can. Craft cocktails looked amazing (though I didn't have any)."}
{"text":"Lively, comfortable, hip atmosphere. Cozy and busy and wonderful.  Definitely a place to start or end an evening.  Fish tacos are great, fried green tomatoes were delicious.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner!  What a delightful surprise!  Located in the Esplanade shopping center, it is not visible from Camelback.  Turn onto 23rd at Camelback and park in AMC theater parking garage.  They will validate your parking ticket.  My husband had burger and I had pulled pork sandwich for lunch.  Outstanding.  For dinner I had the Chicken Ala King (not your mothers' chicken ala king!) and my husband had pot roast with mashed potatoes.  Comfort food with very  upscale presentation.  Delicious drinks.  Great bartender!  It is a really long drive for us but we will certainly go again!!  Can't say enough good about this place! Very reasonable priced!"}
{"text":"Diners, be aware that this restaurant will require a search for a space in a busy parking garage for the Theaters...something we didn't know, as we are new to the area.  Secondly, not a lot of signage to point the direction once you've emerged from the garage.  So, two stars seems low, but my choices are: 1 Star) Eek. Me thinks not!  2) Meh, I've experienced better,  3) A-ok.  4) Yay! I'm a fan., and  5) Woohoo! As good as it gets!.  Meh, I've experienced better.    The restaurant is decorated nicely, and the staff is super friendly.   We split several things, in an effort to try more menu items, and I must say the restaurant was very accommodating to that end...Bravo TEN.    I had the house Chardonnay which was surprisingly drinkable, at a very reasonable $5 per glass, however when I asked for a second glass, wine was poured into the remaining portion of what I had, making it a refill of not a whole glass, and not as enjoyably cold. Bob had the American Mule, which was not noteworthy.    The two of us split an order of Hush Puppies, which were probably the best thing we had, very delicious, we wished there were a couple more of those in the order.  We split a bowl of lentil soup (which was kindly split into two separate cups...kudos), it was good, but a little on the salty side, which, when asked how we liked it, we answered honestly, and received no real concerning response.  On, to the split of the wedge salad (this split arrived on two separate plates with ample portion...nicely done TEN).  They give the option of having the salad chopped, which we selected, and it was divine, all ingredients on point, with perfect proportion....yum.  Finally, we shared the amazing looking fried chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans, which sadly, was so highly seasoned we could not distinguish taste of one thing from another.  I was thinking I think the mashed potatoes are good, but I really can't taste them after a bite of the beans and the chicken.  So, while it wasn't a terrible dining experience, it wasn't my favorite, and I don't think I'd make an effort to go back, but wouldn't avoid this place if I were in the plaza for an unrelated issue."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  This was our first time here and we are definitely coming back! The food was exceptional and prepared perfectly! We had the pleasure of meeting the chef who enlightened our experience. Our server, Bretton, was fabulous!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best Pot Roast ever!!! The wifey and I are definitely coming back...I'm going to try the Roasted Pork Shoulder next visit.  The place is awesome, and the service is outstanding.  The owner/Chef Jeff is very welcoming and Bretton provided stellar service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service is wonderful and the food is great. It is vey hidden so not too packed. The pot roast is very good and I would definitely eat it again."}
{"text":"Food, quite good. Service, attentive and friendly. Where Ten fails mightily is in ambience/decor. It is a white-walled space that resembles an office, decorated with random photos of shadowy architecture and mirrored stars that could easily be from Target. If the theme is Southern, go Southern! It should be colorful, a bit cluttered, and highly atmospheric. I recommend that the management look at a few dozen \"Southern interiors\" including the interiors of popular Southern restaurants for inspiration. The food and the service are the toughest things to get right, getting the interior decor correct would be relatively easy!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich! I probably go once every 1-2 weeks. It's amazing. Great service and Jodee is always fantastic to work with! Great place to go for lunch if you're ever in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Ten and with a Yelp assist. Using the Yelp app we made reservations at the last minute. Upon arrival we were promptly seated. We mentioned to our server we were going to a concert and had a tight schedule. Not a problem.  We enjoyed a couple of apps, an adult beverage and even had time for a dessert. We highly recommend the PB&J ala mode.  Food, service and ambience was first rate!  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about four times now, including last night, and it's been so consistently great I realized I should write a review to let people know about it.  Since this place is tucked away in the Esplanade away from street traffic, in the space once occupied by Fuego (and Nixon's before that), it's easy to miss and hard to stumble onto unless you're heading to or from a movie.  TEN deserves to be so much more than a lunch spot for the offices in the Esplanade!  The food and service are top notch - I've had tilapia, the pot roast, and the pork shoulder, as well as the terrific fried green tomatoes.  My favorite was probably the old-fashioned chicken noodle soup, which I'm convinced cured me of a winter cold last month.    Staff is great and the chef/owner will often come out and chat with diners - super nice guy and you can tell he loves his food and has a story to tell about it.  I hope Phoenix will rally around TEN; this is exactly the kind of locally-owned chef-driven restaurant we need to see more of."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Jodi, our bar tender was amazing and attentive. I'd return just to have a drink with Jodi"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and found this gem. Staff is over the top nice and knowledgeable, made recommendations and didn't miss on anything.  Began at the bar and had the hush puppies (very tasty) and while waiting for friends talked with the owner and his wife (who happened to sit next to us). Very nice selection of bourbon to enjoy. Dinner was exceptional and was made to order and delivered everything as advertised. The chicken ala king & queen was very good and had a ton of flavor, the salmon was some of the best my wife ever had (her words). Friends got the pot roast and steak and stated it was excellent as well. This will be one of our special nights out restaurant and would recommend to anyone wanting a great meal and great atmosphere. Thanks again to Jeff and superior staff Kat & Liz!"}
{"text":"Thanks for another 5 star dining experience.  We enjoyed the fish tacos and a delightful hamburger (the toppings were fresh and unique).  Jeff and the crew are always engaging and pleasant.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Ten! Excellent food, cocktails, service, and pricing. We were very happy with our dinner and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in Central Phoenix, can't wait to go back! The restaurant is unpretentious, very friendly and welcoming which stems from the Chef/Owner Jeff Hostenske. We immediately met him upon our entrance. Not having a reservation on a busy Valentine's Day night, he made room for us and sat us instantly. The place has a very cheery, friendly vibe and I totally felt comfortable and relaxed. The staff were genuine and attentive. The food was excellent - the best thing has to be is the Pot Roast. This is not your typical pot roast, you can cut it with a fork it is so tender and well seasoned. Pair it with a glass of red wine and you are in heaven! The best thing about it is it's not heavy so you don't leave overly full. Chef Hostenske continued to seat and serve guests throughout the night making sure everything was to our liking. We also found the prices to be extremely reasonable as well. Definitely put this place on your next dining out spot to try!"}
{"text":"I've dined out a lot in the Central Phoenix area and I've never had a better dining experience than my first trip to Ten.  The service was attentive, personal, and still sort of casual.  The perfect balance in my opinion.  Even if the food had been mediocre I would probably recommend this place for the service alone, but the food was phenomenal.   We had a special appetizer of the day, breaded mozzarella sticks with homemade marinara.  The marinara was so good I was eating it with a spoon when the mozzarella sticks were gone!  On to my entree, the pot roast.  If it was acceptable to lick my plate in public I would have.  I've never had more tender pot roast with so much flavor.  The mashed potatoes and carrots were also outstanding.  I had the cucumber gimlet with was delicious and also tried the Upper Manhattan which may be the best Manhattan I've ever had.  For dessert we had the PB & J Ala Mode.  The menu description didn't really give a clue as to what it was, but it's basically like a peanut butter blondie with a layer of jelly topped with vanilla bean ice cream and crunchy peanuts or something.  It was very delicious.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Not an extensive menu but everything was great.   The hush puppies aren't like anything I've ever had. I normally don't care for them. Their's were awesome, bacon and chives with an almost liquid core.   Owner is very charismatic and you can tell this place is his passion. He also has a great selection of music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Ten is at the top of my list of Favorite Phoenix Restaurants.   I always get whatever the Chef has prepared for the Special of the day, with outstanding food  Every  Time."}
{"text":"Cute, very quaint. Great food and excellent service. They had a special of the night that I ordered which was amazing! Pork cheeks with wilted spinach and risotto, Yes please!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and very good service. They are very engaged with the customer. The hush puppies are very good as is the pot roast and pot shoulder."}
{"text":"Everything I got from the pan roasted fish to the green tomatoes and the dirty martinis are the bomb.com. If you come to Phoenix you HAVE to drive over here to eat quality, hand crafted food. As a foodie, I'm in love"}
{"text":"I was a little worried when we saw the menu- I am a vegetarian and there weren't really any veggie options on the menu except salads.  But! As soon as I mentioned something to my server, she went into the kitchen, had a chat with the chef, and they provided me a spectacular veggie plate.  Roasted asparagus,  stuffed pepper,  grilled corn,  and fried green tomatoes.  It was amazing! So if you are a veg, give this place a chance. They said you can even call ahead and let them know you are coming."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise!!! This place has a bomb happy hour!!!  The braised beef tacos have a fried egg...yesss!!!  Hush pupoies, fried green tomatoes...all excellent! The craft drinks/cocktails are only $5 during happy hour...Clapped basil drink was yummyyy...I had four!  Evan was the best server too...he was prompt, professional and always smiling!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it Loved it Loved it  One of the most memorable dining experiences ever. Went for wedding anniversary and someone in our party indicated it was our anniversary.   10 minutes later my wife gets a card with a hand written note on a happy anniversary card.   Food  10 out of 10  Free parking voucher.   Highly recommend as top 25 dining experiences of my life. We eat 2/3's of our meals in restaurants so this is against thousands of other venues. The best."}
{"text":"Friendly, comfortable atmosphere that serves very favorful food. The chicken was juicy and Jeff's pan fried fish was delicious. Also had the fish tacos that I liked a lot. The food is well priced and their house wine is good. Our server Kat was pleasant and took good care of us. Definitely know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Reeeediculous how good this place is!!!!  Jeff is awesome !!!!   The only food better, is what my mother cooks....barely!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & drinks.  There were 3 of us & we ordered from the entree's the fish (it was sea bass tonight), fried chicken & pork - we shared so I tried everything - wowzers...tasty!  All great dishes but if I were to rank them in order of greatness it would be chicken, fish (VERY close second - probably one of the best flavored & tender fish I had but I am a sucker for fried foods) & then the pork (super tender and good but My table was not 100% sold on the flavor of the BBQ sauce - so obviously that is just personal preference).  We had a few drinks - my favorite was the mojito.  Waiter was extremely nice & very attentive!  Overall - excellent dining experience & would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and staff were excellent! Great place to stop in for happy hour! The owner/chef stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our food. I will be back, friends in tow!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Took the recommendation from our server and got the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. It was delicious and the atmosphere is great. Just a cute modern meets industrial feel. I will definitely be back if passing through Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Adorable restaurant with great menu and fantastic cocktails. The staff was super friendly and the food and drinks were on point. Was in town for a business trip and this was the perfect spot for a quiet no fuss dinner. I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and it was so full of flavor and not overly messy. Presentation was nice. The grits are so incredible- a must try !"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Excellent food, great beers and the staff is wonderful! Can't say enough great things about our experience here. We will definitely go back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"They have the best Cuban in town hands down!!! I believe that I've tried them all  -- as well as having a wonderfully friendly service & bar staff"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this place a try. The food was absolutely amazing and at a reasonable price. They validated the parking which was also nice. My wife had the shrimp and grit cake  and I had the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. Both were amazing. We each had a cocktail and a beer which were both very good. We enjoyed the place and highly recommend it. We will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I really, really love this place. The food was superb and every single member of the staff was just so friendly and engaging.  Our bartender Bretton was attentive and very good looking (that never hurts). He made a perfect martini and a excellent wine recommendation.  We tried the hushpuppies they were delicious..so much so, we split (we were on our way to a catered party) the Pork Shoulder entree and it was wonderful. The owner was very personable and passionate about food and it shows.  I am not sure how this gem escaped me for 9 months. Don't be like me...go NOW."}
{"text":"Love this place, the people ( especially Jody the hilarious bartender) and all of Jeff's people. Food wise, his pot roast is amazing, steaks are delish, hush puppies, say no more. Cool vibe and happy atmosphere round it out. For lunch, great hamburger or the huge chopped salad, and again, those hush puppies. It's nice to see a locally owned place stand out amongst the vast array of chain restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  Its in a very ritzy part of town but still cool.  the decor is awesome and very trendy.  The food was great.  i wish we would have been able to go there for dinner so i could have tried some of their cocktails.  I had the bbq pork sandwich.  It was very good.  My colleagues had the rueben.  That looked amazing."}
{"text":"Loved the casual bar atmosphere and the drinks were spot on! The fried green tomato was good but the fried chicken was 5 star worthy. We will come back and the service was great."}
{"text":"According to my wife,  who claims Tennessee as home,  the southern fare is delightful.   Hush puppies, NOTHING like Long John silvers', were superb and the buttermilk dressing brought her back to the south (had to order a second batch because they were so good).  The fried green tomatoes treated as though they came off Beale street in Memphis. Real chef...not premade crap out of a bag.   Service was great too.  A new favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find this this place nearly deserted on a Monday night, The construction in the shopping center makes it hard to find, but I'm glad I came in anyway. I took the bartender's suggestions and tried their daily special, A delicious pork tenderloin done to perfection with twice baked potato mash and grilled green beans. Definitely not to be missed was the PB&J à la mode for dessert. The portions were huge but I couldn't stop eating it. I suffered but it was a sweet suffering."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and sociable. Great happy hour special pricing, $5 drinks, half off appetizers. That said, the margarita was just okay (mostly ice) and the fish tacos were very sweet. The location is a bit odd, at least they validate parking."}
{"text":"For starters, the waitress was VERY friendly... had a glass of the house Cabernet and ordered the pot roast. Very good food. Came with steamed carrots and mashed potatoes. I'd totally come back to try those fried chicken... apparently, it's a popular item. Everything is made from from scratch and it shows."}
{"text":"What a cool spot that reminds me of San Francisco every time I go in. Not solely because of the decor and hipster vibe, but because the food is outstanding.   We have been twice, once for dinner and today for happy hour. The dinner was fantastic and I could have tried everything on the menu. The hush puppies, beef tacos, fish tacos were all delicious, and the pork shoulder was phenomenal. I don't think you can wrong with anything here.   Happy hour is a great deal with beers at $3 and their specialty cocktails only $5.  Try the American Mule for a mixed up version of the Moscow.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  I was in town on business and saw the positive reviews- they are all on the spot.  The good is great- a good comfort food menu, the beer selection well put together and outstanding, and the restaurant has a comfortable, cool vibe.  Had a chance to meet the chef/owner and he is a great guy with a great vision.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am was looking through my photos and found the photos I took and thought I give this place a shout out. It was over a year ago so the details are few, but I remember that place being one of the highlights of my week long stay in the Valley for work. Food was great, service was great, drinks just as good. Next time I am in the area I am sure to check this place out and give a more detailed review."}
{"text":"Came for a friends birthday. Had a 20 top. First off they have the best customer service from the moment you enter the door till the moment you leave. Jake and Evan handled our table and were on point the entire time. Quick, efficient , knowledgable and just a true pleasure to have serving us. Second they have Faygo which is a treasured must for a Midwesterner like myself. We orders all of the appetisers which were excellent in portion size and delicious. Personal fav were the shrimp and gritcake. The perfect amount of spice with the gritcakes too. The craft beer menu has a lovely variety of full bodied to light beers. Will be back for sure. Since I have gluten free friends, they will be able to enjoy dining here too."}
{"text":"Went after picking my husband up from the airport and wanting to try something different and picked Ten.  Walked in at 6pm and not terribly busy but quickly changed. Was welcomed by waitstaff and bartender when we walked in. I loved the ambiance because it reminded me of a bistro in Paris. Took the recommendations of the bartender and I had the fish of the day which was tilapia. The fish  was seasoned well and had a nice breading, the corn and green beans were like \"wow\"! So yummy! Hubby had the Cordon Bleu sandwich which made him very happy. I have to mention dessert and we had the PB&J Ala Mode. All I can say is that two days later that I'm still thinking about it. Just try it!!!!! Will be back !"}
{"text":"This place was great. Danny saw this place and picked it out. All the dishes looked great from previous yelpers and the pictures of the inside looked warm and inviting. The restaurant is located in a center next to a movie theater. We parked in the garage. We were greeted right away by the bartender and were seated right away. Again all the dishes were looking so yummy. I wanted to go with the pot roast because it came with mash and carrots. The server told us the special was steak with potatoes, asparagus, and great sauce. I wanted to try the two malbecs and the server made it personable and let me taste both. Danny got a local brew called hop shot which was also super good!  Danny says he would rate this place a five. He states, \"it's legit.\" I would recommend this place as a great place for service, food, and vibe!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loving this place! The ambiance is cool and contemporary. Great lighting and the windows open up into the courtyard. This place is definitely a hidden gem.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing. Moist, so flavorful and filling. I had a green salad on the side with their sweet dressing, also amazing! Unfortunately I had no room for dessert so I'll have to save that for next time.   The staff was so lively and friendly while also being incredibly helpful and attentive. The energy in the restaurant is great!  Parking was also convenient as they do validate."}
{"text":"I am not one to try new things at places. I usually find one meal at a restaurant and always get just that. Hardly ever do I venture out of that norm. However, Ten, has become the exception. Not only is this my neighborhood spot to go to but it is also the best place to get good food and fantastic drinks. The staff is amazing and is always nice. Jeff, the owner, is awesome and a great chef. I have had multiple dishes at Ten and have not been disappointed. The burgers are juicy and cooked to perfection, the sandwiches are impeccable and flavorful. My newest try is the fried chicken and I must say it is to die for. I'll have to try the pot roast next. As for the cocktails, I have never had a better Manhattan than here.  If you like warm, inviting, and casual atmosphere with great wait and bar staff then Ten is the place for you. It is a must see in the Esplanade."}
{"text":"Service is great, and the food is ridiculously good for a surprisingly reasonable price considering the quality.  I've been here a couple of times now and have yet to be disappointed. =]"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited Ten for the very first time this past weekend on a whim. We needed somewhere halfway between both our locations and Ten fit the bill quite nicely. I arrived first and was immediately greeted by a very friendly host (who turned out to be the owner, Jeff).  I was asked if I had a reservation for the night, which I did not. This was \"no problem\", however, and Jeff was happy to seat me anyway. (NOTE: turns out, this IS the sort of place you'd want to make a reservation at.)  Jeff seated my friend and I at a table of four settings - one of those table settings made up of two smaller two-person tables pushed together side-by-side. I make a point of telling you this because it wasn't 10 minutes in before Jeff was back at our table apologizing profusely for having to make a \"very odd request\".  A party of 6 had just arrived and Jeff wanted to know if we would be willing to relinquish one of our two-person tables (two unused settings) for this group. He made a point of saying that he had never been in the position of making such a request in all his 18 years of doing business!  Of course this was no problem whatsoever for us, and we were happy to give up the unused table space, but Jeff offered to buy us each a round of cocktails regardless (I think he may have forgotten to inform our server of this because we still paid for our drinks, but it really is the thought that counts and we both greatly appreciated his willingness to accommodate).  Our server, Carolyn, was very cheerful and attentive and it was very obvious that the entire staff had our utmost comfort in mind. We placed our orders for a salmon dish (my friend) and a pulled pork sandwich (me). Both dishes were BEYOND delicious. Honestly.  The salmon dish featured these roasted tomatoes which were like nothing either of us has ever experienced before. My friend is actually notorious for NOT liking tomatoes, but you should have seen her eyes when she took that first cautious bite. She let me have a bite and later regretted sharing because she was so sad it was gone! Her salmon was equally outstanding.  My pulled pork sandwich was very yummy and the fries were some of the best I've ever had. My friend and I were both very much in awe of how amazing the food was. (This is saying a lot, because we're both unofficial foodies and have enjoyed a LOT of the local offerings. At the end of the day, it takes quite a lot to stand out, ESPECIALLY with American fare.)  All things considered, Ten is an EASY standout. It has everything you look for, from a diverse yet unintimidating menu to fantastic, genuinely heartfelt service to truly delicious and uniquely presented food. They say \"Handcrafted American Fare\", and it fits. The whole experience was very personal and professional and enjoyable.  If you've never been to Ten, you need to go. Make thing of it. Tell them Tim sent you.  ;)  Jeff and Carolyn, thank you so much for making our night a special one. Thank you for all that goes into creating such a wonderful, welcoming atmosphere. It's no question: I WILL be back. (This time I'll make a reservation and maybe dress up a little.) I'll see you both again soon!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Ten this past weekend.  My Husband and I popped in for a early dinner on Saturday night and the place was packed at 6PM.  I love the decor/vibe in the restaurant, but it is small, so as people filtered in it felt a bit crowded (especially sitting at the front of the restaurant).  Our server was super sweet and prompt.  She offered her suggestions, and we ended up with a couple appetizers and shared a sandwich.  For starters we had the shrimp and gritcake and the hush puppies.  Both were very good and actually complimented one another.  The gritcake tasted more like a corn cake to me, but either way it was delish and the whole dish had a great kick.  The Hush puppies were great as well.  The addition of blue cheese and bacon was a nice touch... though I almost wish it was inside instead of on top.  For our entree we shared the cuban sandwich.  It was really good, don't get me wrong, but maybe too much ham.  The bread was falling apart a bit as well, which made it hard to eat.  The flavors were great though.  With Ten right by the movie theater, I'm sure we will be back soon to try more of their offerings.  This seems like a great happy hour spot, so that is reason enough to be back."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on YELP @ it was all or better than expected. The hush puppies with blue cheese & bacon were amazing.   So light & the sauce was the perfect amount of spice.  We shared the pulled pork sandwiches & they were delicious.   BUT best of all was out server Jodee, she was fun, helpful & prompt.  Would go again when we get back to the Phoenix area.  Good wine selections.  Affordable menu."}
{"text":"We had a party of six to celebrate a birthday. We wound up having a variety of cocktails, all of the appetizers, and several of the entrees, followed by 2 signature deserts. Cutting to the chase, we agree wholeheartedly with previous 5-star reviewers. We live in Ahwatukee 20 miles to the South, worth the drive, and we will be back. Excellent atmosphere, superb service, & very tasty food & drink! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Place is a 10! Don't look any further for a awesome dinner. Hearty Southern food, but also light entrees.. There are plenty of Sam Fox and chains, support a local restauranteur. Owner is a nice guy!"}
{"text":"I've seen nothing but rave reviews for Ten Handcrafted and really wanted to go for dinner! After seeing their happy hour prices & selections though, we really couldn't pass up that deal. We went for the happy hour and figured if we were still hungry afterwards, we could get something else.  When we arrived, we were actually pretty hungry so one of each item on the happy hour menu - Shrimp & Gritcake, Hush Puppies, Fried Green Tomatoes, Braised Beef Tacos, & Fish Tacos!  We also got a couple of drinks to start with while waiting for our appetizers. Everything but the tacos came out together so we got to trying the food out.  My favorite were the Hush Puppies, they were slightly dense but still fluffy & tasty with the dipping sauce! The Shrimp had a smokey taste which I didn't particularly care for but I did enjoy the gritcake. Tacos were brought out to us a little bit later; my husband really enjoyed the Braised Beef ones especially with the fried egg. The fish tacos were much lighter with the flaky fish & mango salsa on top!  The appetizers were large enough that we ended up not needing any additional food. I'd recommend trying out all the items on the happy hour menu except maybe the Fried Green Tomatoes as they were a bit bland compared to the other items. The restaurant is pretty small so if you're going on a weekend night I'd try to get a reservation! Overall, we were happy with the food & service, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great atmosphere and owners!  Food was amazing.  It's in a very quirky location, so you have to be looking for it - you won't likely stumble upon it as you're strolling along the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I split two appetizers, one salad, one entree and dessert. Each dish was really good! Hush puppies spot on, fish tacos were off the hook, spinach and goat cheese salad was well balanced, New York strip steak special was exceptional and the chocolate cake topped it off. Jeff, the owner, was welcoming and gracious. Server, Kat, was outstanding. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Chef/Owner Jeff Hostenske. Not only is he a great chef, he is also genuinely a nice person. I felt so welcome by him while at his restaurant. The great food was the icing on the cake. Speaking of cake, we couldn't pass on the PB&J Ala Mode dessert. Mum, mum, good! Just all around a great secret gem that could be missed in Esplanade plaza."}
{"text":"My wife and I have now been here twice, and are very glad we came back.  Both times we've gone, the servers have been very kind. Service was definitely better overall the second time, but only because the staff seemed overwhelmed the first time.  The ambiance is very nice and intimate.  Great for a date.  The food and drinks overall are very good.  The first time we went, I really enjoyed the Pot Roast, but they were out of steak, so my wife got the Pork Shoulder and wasn't  too impressed.  The second we went, we both got steak, and it was EXCELLENT.    In my opinion what makes this a 5-star restaurant is the Owner Jeff.   In all my time trying different restaurants in the Phoenix area, I've never come across someone more passionate about his business.  You should definitely give it a try.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food and yummy drinks! Really reasonably priced as well! Just in a weird location and kind of hard to find."}
{"text":"Went to TEN for Restaurant week this evening and left completely satisfied. It's amazing how much better food taste when service and plates are perfectly executed! Jeff the owner (and Cheft) came out and checked on us multiple of times. I can tell not only is jeff proud and take good pride in himself, but he gives all the credit to his amazingly wonderful staff. I can't enough positive things about our visit tonight... And to have met such a humble person as Jeff, gives us all the reasons to come back!   We ordered one of each item from the restaurant week menu, and each was perfectly designed to fill your tummy with warmth. So happy we chose this as our first stop of Restaurant week.   Thank you for giving us the Midwestern hospitality! All the best to Jeff and his staff.   Please come here and share the same experience we did."}
{"text":"Very good food. Parking is a pain, but they do validate the parking if you bring your ticket."}
{"text":"We are here for Spring Training from N California. So happy to have found this place on Yelp. So many good reviews we had to try it for ourselves. Friendly, attentive staff, nice ambience and awesome food. Hush puppies were flavored and prepared perfectly. My wife had the pot roast and I had the Denver steak and fries. Both were excellent. We are definite going to be return patrons next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Our table split three appetizers, and they were all delicious. I had the chicken noodle soup for dinner and I highly recommend it. The service was great and I loved the atmosphere. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I really love the happy hour here. Great deals to be had on drinks & food. The drinks were delicious, the food tasty, & the service was consistently great throughout. Keep up the good work. I'll be back."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a two hour meeting tomorrow and staying at the Embassy Suites Phoenix Biltmore across the street, looked at local eateries and said what the hell, gonna try Ten! Glad I did! Walked in and got a seat at the bar! Amanda the bartender was as pretty as she was sweet, explained the specials and made an awesome LIT for me. Ordered the Steak and Fries, well cooked, though needed a little A1, still very good and plentiful. Small and comfortable setting, even if I am from NC, the clientele made me feel at home.  My new must stop when in town! Thanks Y'all!   Ok swear to the good Lord, i do not work here! My flight was delayed to ATL, so would miss my connection to Raleigh. Decided to spend another night in Phoenix. Went back to try the Fried chicken, being a Southern boy, it was awesome with the spicy green beans, mashed P and really good white gravy! Now, when I walked in the door? Ms. Amanda didn't just recognize me, she introduced me to everyone at the bar! As the saying' goes' \"I ain't from here but was made to feel like I should be\" Thank you all!  If you are anywhere near? Ask for the Mezcal!  Cheers Chef!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Besides delicious choices of fish tacos, perfectly seasoned shrimp & gritcake, pulled pork sandwich, cheeseburger with perfect fries, the detailed customer service from Jeff, left me with a great taste  He personally makes sure the customer is totally satisfied.   It's a win-win   Great food & royal treatment."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! The service was excellent, and the food is amazing. Comfort food done right!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here one night by chance and only had time for drinks at the bar. The menu caught our eye while we sat and had amazing old fashioned cocktails. We were finally able to return tonight for an actual meal. Hush puppies were crisp and the perfect comfort food... My husband had the pot roast and literally scraped his plate clean. I had the braised beef tacos that were topped with a perfectly cooked egg.... Dessert... Brownie with some sort of magical caramel sauce. The service was impeccable, friendly and attentive staff, and the bill was surprisingly reasonable for the quality and quantity. Our new favorite place for sure."}
{"text":"Food was honestly disappointing. My expectations were set higher because of the reviews. Had fish tacos and they were very bland. The bbq pulled pork sandwich was meh, nothing special. I got my son the Mac and cheese and it was mushy noodles with velveeta base cheese sauce. The hush puppies were just okay as well. Worst Arnold Palmer I've tasted. The waitress Hannah was super sweet though."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner location with surprising food and friendly service!  A great date night location and I will be back for their \"Decompress\" (Happy Hour) after work. Our food: Hush Puppies, Pork Shoulder, Tuna - all made with love and tasting amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, we went out for the soft open and had the most amazing food! The dessert though was by far my favorite, just thinking about it now gets me salivating! Pb&J brownie! Sounds strange but trust me you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went to 10 a few weeks ago and were BLOWN away. Not only was the service awesome (our server KAT was awesome), but the chef even came out to ask about our meal and the service. If you want the best pot roast and cooked carrots in the valley - this is the place! The hush puppies were AWESOME as well. It was a tad pricey, but well worth the money! I DEFINITELY will visit again!"}
{"text":"Small little place that you may have to look for, but well worth the effort. Had great food and tasty cocktails, in a nice little spot that felt very comfortable and welcoming. I've been eating my way around the menu, but two standouts so far are the Shrimp & Gritcakes appetizer (even if you don't like grits!) and pretty much anything they have for dessert. Tasty, wonderful stuff, and worth (trying) to save some room for."}
{"text":"Pot roast and mash potatoes was top notch! Reasonable prices, good vibe/lounge/chill music, friendly staff.  Very trendy spot, I will be back"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was chill. Service was great. Food was amazing. Great place to go for high end comfort good without the high end prices and hoity toity personnel."}
{"text":"Great food, we had the pulled pork which was excellent. Nice beer assortment and nice service. We had a hard time finding the restaurant but it was well worth the search."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with family, hoping to see what all these 5 star reviews were about. We left perplexed because our experience was nothing resembling 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, the cocktails were great but at one point we looked at each other and asked, \"are we being punked?\" When ordering, one of us requested cheddar instead of American on their burger and was told that they don't have cheddar. (What?) There were two vegetarians with us, so they asked what the veggie option was and the server talked up how \"inventive\" the chef gets with the vegetarian dishes (ooh, can't wait!). Wanting to know what they would be eating before they ordered this mysterious and inventive dish, they and the rest of the table was underwhelmed when the server (who had to go into the kitchen to find out what they would make) came back with \"roasted vegetables and rice.\" (Seriously?) The vegetarians at the table eat/make that for themselves just about most nights. When the entrees arrived, one burger that was supposed to be medium was actually rare, the Baby Greens salad was brought out (that coincidentally also had American cheese on it...who puts American on a salad?) instead of the Spinach & Green Apple salad that was ordered, and two salads were missing cheese all together. Our server (who wasn't the same server we started out with, which was a little weird in and of itself) was apologetic and confessed that there was a new guy in the kitchen. We were left wondering what restaurant all these Yelp reviewers went to. Ten only had one chance and blew it."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience from the excellent bar, delicious food and friendly staff. Made reservations through Yelp and was surprised to see a reserved sign on our table. Owner stopped by several times to ask us if we were enjoying out meal. Hush puppy appetizer was great and got things started. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After visiting this spot, I now under what all the hype is about. Actually, this is not hype, this is truth! Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by a very upbeat and pleasant waitress. She was very attentive and helpful throughout our whole dining experience. We politely sat us down and gave us a brief overview and history of this quaint, intimate, and classy restaurant. She told us that they will be celebrating their 1 year anniversary tomorrow and was thrilled that they \"survived\" the first year in business.   The menu was small which means that they put more care into the dishes. I started out with the shrimp and grit cake and followed it up with the cuban sandwich. I can say that the shrimp and grit cake was wonderfully done. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauce contained just the right amount of heat. The grit cake was a pleasant surprise and added the perfect texture to the dish. The dish was very tasty and very well executed concept of a play on the traditional shrimp and grits.   As far as my cuban goes, it will be hard to find another one as good in the valley. This is authentic as it gets. Just as the chef/owner admitted when he personally stopped by the table, \"I spent some time working in Miami, so I learned a thing or two down there!\" haha. The break was right, it was pressed and toasted, and the ham, roasted pork, cheese, pickle, and mustard made this cuban staple a must have in the valley.  Overall, I can not give this place any less than 5 stars. The food was excellent and the service was impeccable. Please make sure to visit this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Often times, when you walk into a restaurant at this price range, you are partially paying for the privilege of \"feeling like a boss\". Many places like this justify the mediocreness of their food with the fancy furniture and light fixtures, and the fancy feeling you get when you hold a thick bottom glassware.  This place is the best restaurant I have been, in terms of food and service and cleanness, and in terms of drinks and in terms of price.   I started with a drink named \"Crashed Basil\". It was very nicely done. The drink has a well balanced floral flavor, with the crashed basil and added the prefect amount of freshness. It was like a fresh floral summer breeze that gently relaxes you with the liquor, which you can't taste, but you know that they didn't cheap you out on it.  Then I had hush puppies. What is special about this item is the sauce they have along with it. Of course, having the hush puppies fried the right amount of crispness is expected of such a place. But the sauce is a bacon&blue cheese rouille sauce, instead of you generic honey mustard.  I had a pork shoulder for entree. The meat was juicy, perfectly sauced with a hint of lemon if I recall. What it makes it amazing is when you eat it with the side - a perfectly sautéed vegetable dish with slight hint of spiciness and the right amount of crunchiness.   This place is inside of a building which is a bit hard to locate. However, if you do go, you would truly understand the term \"hidden gem\"."}
{"text":"This place was great. The food was great, the service was exceptional and the environment is so relaxing and cool. I would highly recommend you come here for a great experience."}
{"text":"Two friends and I stopped into Ten for some drinks and apps before a movie and were unpleasantly surprised by our experience. The restaurant is pretty small, but seemed like a cool place to hang out. Only about half the tables downstairs were occupied. The hostess asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and told us we would have to go upstairs (not a problem). When we got upsrairs, the hostess had to turn the lights on. There was no one seated up there. So we sat down and she said very matter-of-factly \"Moving forward you should make a reservation, we get very busy during Spring Training\". That was odd since it's only January, and there were more empty tables than occupied tables.   So we sat down and each of us ordered a drink and an app, which came out rather slowly. They didn't have any beer on tap, but a decent selection of bottles and cans. I had the Shrimp & Gritcakes and it was horrible! The gritcake tasted like a burnt pancake sitting in fish sauce, which made it very soggy and unappetizing. It was topped with a few pieces of shrimp and andouille sausage, which were edible, but not worth the $12 I spent. The Hush Puppies were tasty, and so were the Braised Beef Tacos (but the fried egg was burnt). The waitress didn't asked if we wanted to have another drink, so we decided to pay our tab and head out.   I would have liked to enjoy my experience at Ten, but I was greatly disappointed. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very kind staff, excellent food, and low pricing; what more could you want. Excellent place to end the business day!"}
{"text":"I am surprised this place gets so many 5 stars. Here is a list of my review ... - Food is decent, great happy hour menu  - No draft beer available, only cans or bottles - When I asked the chef/owner? regarding the usage of the 2nd floor section for a private party, he was not very helpful. He just pretty much said \"it depends\" (wow) I expected he would tell me more details on pricing or menu options but no. - By the time when one of our friends showed up (after her long hours of work), I guess we were just chatting, not eating or ordering \"enough\" food or drinks, different servers kept coming & asking us how we're doing as if they want us to leave if we are not ordering anything. So we felt uncomfortable and decided to leave. The server started to clear our table when we were still there and even made a comment like \"you girls are tiny and barely ate but you did good!\" Jokingly but we all went outside and looked at each other ... Yes we (4 of us) were there for a long time on your busy Friday night with our bill just $70, but we didnt deserve this as customers. I gave 3 stars for decent food and our first hostess/server was kind. We are not going back there for sure..."}
{"text":"Fantastic establishment. A very relaxed atmosphere with sophistication. The bartender Bretton is very knowledgable on crafted drinks and food. He has great suggestions and is very creative with the food and drinks just ask. My favorite was the American mule. Prices are perfect and the service is superb. I will definitely be back when I visit Phoenix in the future. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I had some of the best fish in my life last night. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. It was crispy on the outside and still glistened on the inside. It was seasoned perfectly. Brett gave us some great service too. They earned the fifth star."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp, looking for something near the AZ Heart Hospital.  If you're not local, be sure to wander around back to the public parking, as there's nowhere nearby to park on the street and no parking lot.  The parking is behind the AMC \"Dine-In\" Theaters.  The restaurant is hidden in an area with shops and other restaurants.  The decor is very unique & cool with Edison bare bulb fixtures made from plumbing pipes.  The iced tea and water stands are tool chests.  The service was excellent, frequent refills and visits to check on us.  The food was delicious, we both had the pulled pork sandwich with fries.  The server noticed I put table black pepper on my ketchup and offered the pepper grinder to offer fresh ground pepper on my sandwich, fries and ketchup.  The buns were artisan style, not the usual sesame seed boring buns, very fresh and fluffy.  The pulled pork was overflowing, tender, juicy and tasty.  The fries were plentiful.  I can't say enough about enjoying my experience and will return on future visits.  Be sure to have them give you a validated parking ticket when you leave, if you park in the parking garage."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!  Came here with my folks and the food is insanely delicious! My table had the hush puppies, chicken noodle soup, pot roast, salmon, steak, and pb&j ice cream dessert. Holy crap! They were all soooo tasty.  The servers were awesome and the ambience superb! You could not go wrong with this place! We went on a Friday night and the place was booked solid.  Definitely a must try for all!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 5. Quite rowdy on a Tuesday night. The staff was friendly. The drinks were fine. Food was good too. Got the fried green tomatoes, fried well but flavor was so so. The hush puppies were excellent. I got the prime rib which was not bad, served with mashed potatoes and carrots which were excellent. Overall a great meal. Price point was not bad but could be better. 4.5/5, would come again"}
{"text":"I'm a true Yelp believer, so when I see a restaurant with almost 200 reviews and a 5-star average, I'm bound to get curious. My husband and I went to Ten straight from the Phoenix airport, to meet a couple of friends for dinner. It was good, but I do find the unanimous 5-star love kind of baffling.  We were able to book a table online like an hour in advance, which was definitely a plus. There was also complimentary valet parking for the Camelback Esplanade. But about that Camelback Esplanade--it was this nice complex with fancy restaurants and shops, but it felt very mall-like, sterile and soulless, a plaza attached to a wealthy, unimaginative suburb. Ten was tucked deep in the Esplanade. The ambiance was comfortable and casually upscale, but it did feel vaguely like a chain restaurant. I was also disappointed in the selection of spirits, given the emphasis in the restaurant's name. None of the cocktails sounded interesting, and there were no beers on tap. The wine was reasonable, at least. We ended up splitting a $34 bottle of pinot noir. It was decent.  Atmosphere aside, we did have a lovely dinner. My husband and I caught up with two school friends who'd moved to Phoenix, one of whom we hadn't seen in years. Service was good, and the meal was pleasant and relaxing. The food was also quite solid. We shared some hush puppies, and these were excellent, fresh from the fryer with a crispy crust to the outsides and fluffy but substantial innards. They came with a crumble of bacon and blue cheese, with a rouille dipping sauce on the side. Lots of good flavor all around. I got the pot roast for my entree, and this was good, if not amazing. The roast was tender and moist, if not in every bite, and it tasted hearty and comforting. It came with mashed potatoes and carrots--the potatoes were great, especially with the drippings of the roast, but the carrots were pretty bland and easy to ignore. My husband's roasted pork shoulder was the better entree, a gorgeous plate of slow roasted pork cooked just right, with a sweet BBQ glaze and a mashed potatoes and collard greens on the side. Definitely the thing to get here--my husband was very happy, and I was a little bit jealous.  I had a nice time at Ten. I enjoyed the food and wine and company, and would be inclined to come back if I lived in Phoenix. I guess I will say it's not necessarily worth going out of your way for, despite the rave reviews. The atmosphere struck me as strange, but maybe that's just the Angeleno in me. I think I count as a hipster in Phoenix, and Ten strikes me as the kind of restaurant that pops up in a hipster-free zone. Good food without a ton of character, and not enough of an emphasis on booze."}
{"text":"Amanda took care of me and I had an incredible time! Excellent drinks with wonderful ambiance, food, and service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome service!! It's a cozy place and beautiful inside. We had the burger, cordon bleu sandwich, margaritas and chocolate cake...so good!! Oh the hush puppies we crisp with a hint of sweetness, delicious. Can't wait to go a second time. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Jake hooked us up. We had my 96 yr old mother in law with us. He set us up with a convenient table that worked well for the full party. Evan was our waiter and he was great. Some of us had the steak and shrimp special and it was crazy good. Others ordered from the menu and didnt go wrong with the really delicious fried chicken and also the pot roast. Everyone had a great experience. Be sure to give it a try."}
{"text":"We popped in for drinks and a snack while waiting for friends to finish their movie.  The drink menu is creative and interesting.  The hush puppies are delish - but note that much of the \"good stuff\" falls to the bottom of the \"cone.\"  Make sure to eat that!"}
{"text":"This place was the whole package: great food, great service, and great surroundings. It isn't to showy or stuffy, but comfortable and we left nothing on our plates. We had the Shrimp Gritcake, Chicken al a King, and the Pan Roasted Fresh Fish. All were fantastic, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were awesome as was Joedee the bartender.  We had a great time talking baseball, basketball and enjoying our food and drinks. Great place, wonderful atmosphere. Came here straight from the airport and were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice, small craft menu. The staff was great. We started off with the Bacon and Blue Cheese Hushpuppies and the Shrimp and Grit cake. Both were tasty appetizers. For the main course I had the Pot Roast. The food was awesome with generous portions."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The staff including the owner Jeff(I believe) makes you feel at home -- like you've known them forever! They are very attentive but not to a point where they are bothering you.   This was the first time I tried not your fathers root beer and I've been addicted since. I've only tried their drinks and appetizers -- I tried the hush puppies and the shrimp and gritcakes and both were very tasty.  One time we came they had a special -- fries with cheese and bacon on top and we couldn't stop eating that!  The food is tasty, I wouldn't say the best but love the vibe!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a couple beers after work and was pleasantly surprised. Perfectly cozy little place offering great service and a pretty killer selection of craft beers. The bartender was extremely personable and it couldn't have been more apparent that he actually LOVED his job. I will definitely be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Carmella and Jacob were great, honest and funny. The food is extremely tasty. A must visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the good old burger! Medium well! I must say burger was grilled to perfection. My only complain is about the fries that came with it. Fries were soggy and didn't go well with the burger at all. Ambience was good and they have a descent beer selection as well. They don't offer beer on drafts though."}
{"text":"Awesome place to visit. Great friendly service and awesome food.  If you want a recommendation, take it from an out-of-towner. Fried chicken."}
{"text":"Seriously couldn't have expected how good this experience was.  Arrived late and were greeted by Jake and Bretton with a warm welcome.  Didn't hesitate to let us order (and split) dinner even though they were closing in 20 minutes.  We went with their recommendations for both dinner and cocktails and were NOT disappointed!  Incredible!  The food, cocktails and service were all 5 star worthy!  This is now one of our regular spots for lunch, HH and dinner!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for Valentine's Day. You would expect for service to be weak because of the holiday but that was not the case. The owner greeted us at the door and our waiter Jake was very attentive (especially for my gluten free needs). The atmosphere was great and the prices were reasonable.  My party of 4 was happy with our night and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"A+ for effort and manager's service...  We ordered the braised beef tacos. Yum.   Wedge salad was okay, pork sandwich was yummy. Then we ordered the mahi mahi special of the night. It was pretty bad. Very over seasoned, fish and all (potatoes, kale). And I love salty food! Tried to stomach it, but had to send it back.    It's clear the manager/owner(?) cares very much about his customers having a good experience. He did not charge us for the fish, and he had made me another dish to make up for it (also not charged for this)   So, the service was good. The interior is nice; its cozy. Odd location unless you are going to the movie, but if you are familiar with esplanade, it's easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"Ten Handcrafted American Fare & Spirits is a hidden gem, tucked in a corner of the Camelback Esplanade (across the street from the Biltmore Fashion Square).  Parking is quite easy as there is a large parking lot right behind the restaurant that accepts validations from the restaurant.   We have been there four times (three dinners and once for lunch) and the service has always been outstanding and the food very good to outstanding.  The owner is a Southerner so you can expect to find things like shrimp and grits, fried green tomatoes and fried chicken on the menu.  Some of our favorites have included the Denver steak and fries, the buttermilk fried chicken and the roasted pork shoulder.  The Pot Roast was good, albeit not stellar.  For dessert, the PB&J Ala Mode was exceptional but the Chocolate Brownie Ala Mode was to die for.  The drinks (so my wife reports) are fantastic, especially the American Mule (who needs to go to Moscow to find a mule?).  As an appetizer, the chopped salad was fantastic.  Best of all, the prices are quite reasonable, with only the steaks eclipsing $20.  Finally, the service has ALWAYS been stellar, regardless of the person handling our table.  The restaurant is small, although it has several tables upstairs that can handle larger crowds or private functions.  The Chef/Owner Jeff HosTENske hails from Charleston, SC and I just hope he never does a Rhett Butler and return to his hometown--we need him here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this cozy bar/pub tucked away in the beautiful Biltmore/Esplanade area. The food is always amazing, and the chef and staff are very attentive to our experience there.  My husband is a vegeterian and the chef personally has made him some amazing dishes, not even on the menu!   Great place to grab drinks and apps with friends!!!!  The happy hour drinks and menu options are also two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"With all the great reviews, I was skeptical that it could live up to the hype, but Ten was great! The food was fantastic--I had the wedge salad and hush puppies--and our service was even better! We were here for a birthday and the brought free desserts. The location is tucked back in a little alleyway, so difficult to find if you don't know the area. Please open a location in Chicago soon!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The shrimp and grits cakes are the best! The hush puppies are so delicious, they are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and then topped off with blue cheese. These are a must every time we go to Ten. My favorite sandwich is the pulled pork with coleslaw.This sandwiche is huge and I get it with the fries which are also the best. My husband loves the chicken cordon blue sandwich which is always yummy as well. Ten never disappoints.The service, food, and drinks are consistently a wonderful experience. I recommend this restaurant whole heartedly , it's our favorite!!"}
{"text":"Try the fried Green Tomatoes! Wow! Best tacos! Great presentation. Tired of the usual come here bring a guest and impress them. :)"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem in the Biltmore area of Phoenix. Not only was the service superb but the food and cocktails were fabulous!! The ambiance is perfection with a mid-century modern feel. I will absolutely return and am looking forward to trying other menu items. I had the pan-seared fish (which was sea bass that day) and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Always a nice stop when seeing a movie at The AMC Esplanade... and again after! ;) Happy Hour from 2-6pm for six dollar cocktails and house wines, four buck drinks, domestic AND craft beers, select apps between 3.50-6.00. Joedee at the bar is awesome and would love it if you told her I sent you ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  First time here after a movie at AMC.  Made reservations and a good thing because they were crowded.  I had the Cuban sandwich which was terrific.  The rest of our group had the pot roast and salmon.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This review is soooo long overdue for me. By far one of my FAVORITE places in the Phoenix area. My fiancé and I used to live over by the Esplanade and one day we were looking for a new place to try. We stumbled upon this gem - happened to be the day it opened - and we could never get enough!  Jeff (owner) and Bretton (head bartender/manager/hope he's still there!) treat you like family and the food is just as comforting. Their cocktails are to die for and almost dangerous because of how good they taste. Try this place once and you will find yourself going back again and again because of the amazing food, craft cocktails, ambiance and hospitality! Ready for Jeff to open another concept!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time about a week ago and I can't wait to go back. We saw there sign for 10% off with a movie ticket stub and decided to try it. First off the service was amazing, the server was overly friendly, fun to talk to and had helpful suggestions. The food was equally amazing, I had the chicken cordon blue sandwich, at the table was also the roasted pork shoulder and a burger. Everyone loved there meal and there was much more on the menu that we need to go back for. Prices are totally reasonable. Decor is great, designed well, intimate, clean and fun. The owner/chef even came out and talked to us for a little bit, friendly, knowledgable and really clear that he's putting out quality food. I would suggest this to anyone, it's a little hidden but well worth it."}
{"text":"Holy foodie heaven! I came here with a good friend for Happy Hour because i've had it bookmarked for FAR too long! Needless to say, I was MORE than impressed. The service was absolutely phenomenal. They were so nice and excited to have us in. They are also SO proud of their food, as they should be!   For drinks, we both had Cucumber Gimlets and they were SO great, that we had to go for a second one. ;) The fresh muddled cucumber made the drink.   For food, we had the Shrimp & Gritcake... YOU GUYS, this is a MUST when you come! I can't even describe the flavors because they were so unique but this dish is heaven. Next, we ordered the fish tacos and braised beef tacos. Both were heavenly.   The Happy Hour prices are GREAT; under $8 for food and drinks and everything was phenomenal. I'll most definitely be back for dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here for drinks after seeing a movie. The bar tender was visibly annoyed when we walked in. I asked the server if it was ok. If we were there and she assured us it was ok, but after delivering our drinks we were given our checks and told they were closing. We drank as quickly as possible but I guess not quickly enough as our drinks were cleared before even asking if we were finished. It was around 9pm when we got there but I guess the staff wanted to get home early. I was hoping after a round of closures in this complex Ten would hang on, but after tonight's service I'm afraid they have one foot out the door."}
{"text":"We got off a plane in Phoenix and, as is our practice, looked for the best rated local dinner restaurant closest to the airport and headed that way. We were not disappointed - they really deserve this rating! I had the pork shoulder and it was so tender I was stunned - I could have probably ate another one!    It's so easy to drop into a big chain restaurant like Seasons 52 or Hillhouse - but we live to support these awesome little local restaurants, especially when they are this good.  The Owner Chef was an enthusiastic host - really personable - and talented!  It's a little had to find - they are right next to the AMC theaters in the complex - free valet!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service. Place looks much nicer than what shows on pics. Kat was our server and she was wonderful."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. We had a big table everything was amazing both service and food. Totally recommend pot roast and fresh fish was grouper!!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant to add to my list! Found this place through yelp when I was looking for somewhere I haven't been to have a Galentine's Day dinner with some friends. Warm and welcome greeting at the door let us know our table was just about ready. Our server was on point! She kept or glasses full and our food was delivered perfectly! We all ended up having appetizers, which were all amazing! But I know I'll be going back soon to try as many of the entrees as I can! One of my favorite parts is that it's a relatively small space. Which means you don't have to shout over everyone else just to ask someone to pass the salt and pepper. Really great spot. I'll be going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"When a business garners an average of 5 stars after more than 100 reviews on Yelp, you get there as soon as you can.  When said restaurant is featured as part of the wildly popular Arizona Restaurant Week, you get there as fast as your car, bike, feet, whatever will carry you.  On a Friday after work I made a point to get to Ten with big hopes that this relatively new Biltmore area find would live up to the hype.  The restaurant is located in what I believe used to be the old Fuego Tacos spot just downstairs from the AMC Movie Theatres.  They do validate your parking if you use the garage so no worries there.  Maybe I just remember Fuego Tacos differently, but I forgot just how tiny the space was.  The restaurant can actually seat a fair amount of people thanks to being two stories, but both the top and bottom levels alone are quite small.  When I arrived here with my brother around Friday at 5 the bar area was packed with happy hour goers but the rest of the restaurant was relatively empty so we just grabbed a table.  Neither the regular menu nor the Restaurant Week menu was too extensive here, but most of their greatest hits appeared on the Restaurant Week so I went that route.  For a starter I went with their Bacon and Bleu Cheese Hush Puppies.  There were four hush puppies in all and they came with what tasted almost like a garlic chipotle dipping sauce.  Loved the hush puppies themselves and the dipping sauce was terrific, but the bleu cheese and bacon were a chore just to get ahold of.  Kinda wish they'd incorporated these toppings into the hush puppies themselves rather than make me fetch the toppings out of the basket they came in.  For the main dish, I went with the pot roast as that also seemed to be a popular choice.  It came with carrots and mashed potatoes.  Healthy portion, but a pretty simple dish.  I will say I was expecting the pot roast to be a little more tender than it turned out to be.  I've had pot roast at numerous other restaurants (including a nearby sports bar) that cuts with a fork, but I needed the knife on this one.  For the most part, the meat was still tender and tasty and the juices meshed great with the potatoes and carrots.  Not the best pot roast I've had, but good.  For dessert, it was a classic chocolate cake with ice cream.  The ice cream was excellent and much denser than most I've had but the cake was honestly pretty average.  The chocolate filling within the cake was solid but the cake itself was a tad dry for my taste.  It tasted like it'd been in the fridge rather than freshly made.  Total price for the three dishes, plus a glass of wine (which was free with the Restaurant Week promotion by the way), plus tax and tip came to about $45.  Was a good meal?  Yes.  Was it a great meal?  Can't say that with as much confidence.  I'd certainly come back to try again as some of their other dishes looked pretty interesting, but their most popular dishes didn't really do it for me.  As a happy hour spot or even a lunch spot, this seems like it'd be a cool place to get together with friends or coworkers for some apps and drinks.  But as a sit down dinner place, Ten will have to up their game next time.  Its not often a 5 star Yelp rated establishment fails to live up to its rating, but I guess there's a first time for everything."}
{"text":"Great service, but my salad left much to be desired. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food, so I think I must have ordered the wrong thing. Great convenient spot across from the office I work from in Phoenix, so I'm sure I'll be back to give it another go."}
{"text":"Fantastic new place at Camelback Esplanade with a very cool vibe and amazing food. Excellent American food with a twist. Instead of focusing on the appearance it's all about the flavor, and it looks great too! Everything from fried green tomatoes to pot roast and chicken a la king with wonderful flavors. Tastes like Mom would have made if she was an inspired cordon Bleu chef. Can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I got the pork shoulder as my entree and split hush puppies and shrimp and grits with my party and all 3 were great.  The appetizers weren't spectacular but the pork shoulder brought me home.  (I am originally from South Carolina)"}
{"text":"Gosh, this place is amazing. I'm a foodie and I've eaten in many restaurants around the valley. Ten is most definitely in my top 3. It's affordable and the food NEVER disappoints. I can eat their shrimp and grit cake and pot roast everyday. Plus service is amazing, and drinks are good."}
{"text":"This place is great! Carmelo was funny and helped us with great recommendations that were honest and descriptive.  As a southerner who moved to the West Coast, this place gets it right.  Great cocktails, great vibe, and incredible service!  Don't miss this place if you're in AZ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. The location is super nice and the restaurant itself is cool. We had the hush puppies and fried green tomatoes as appetizers and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Food, service, ambiance...it's all there. A friend and I decided to try someplace new and the reviews on Yelp were spot on. We got in just before Happy Hour ended and had an American Mule...really well done. They don't skimp on the pour. We started with apps of shrimp & gritcake and the hush puppies. The shrimp was perfect and topped with a thin slice of andouille sausage to give it a little kick. The grits were amazing with a perfect thin crunch. The hush puppies were terrific, but it's the blue cheese & bacon crumbles that you roll them in after dipping their killer sauce that make the mark. We ended up sharing a chopped salad and fish tacos for dinner. I can eat...and the portions were more than enough to share. Shout out to Carmella our server! She's got that \"I'm from Boston\" attitude that made the whole experience fantastic!  She was terrific at guiding our decisions and has a great sense of humor.  Will definitely be back to try more of this menu. Unique, creative, fresh...and delicious. The Chef's passion and creativity really shine through."}
{"text":"Small and clean menu. The $22 Steak & Fries and the Hush Puppies could be tastier (in my opinion) but their desert PB&J Ala Mode is phenomenal.  Great service, decor and ambience. Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - I was shocked my friends and I had never heard of it. I actually found them on yelp. It was REALLY good! I had the burger which was awesome and my husband had steak which he said was a little salty, but still good. The atmosphere was great - we went with another couple and sat there for 2.5 hours. We had a great time! The service was also superb. We will be back, Ten!"}
{"text":"Dear Phoenix, Please NEVER go to TEN, because if you do you'll take my seat and I'll has a sad.   Love,  Me.  This restaurant is absolutely amazing. Someone told me it's a \"Hidden Gem\". No, it's a hidden gem mine.  The food is fresh, thoughtfully prepared and outstandingly delicious. Every bite of every dish is a testament to the careful planning and preparation of the food by the Chef/Owner of TEN, Jeff Hostenske.  I don't think it's selling the man short to say that he's right up on the genius level of culinary art because he takes absolutely simple dishes and executes them with such perfection and precision that they are just one step beyond excellent.   We all ordered something different, although we started off with the Hush Puppies which had the fatal flaw of not being enough... :) they were perfect crisp, delicious and a bit sweet like every hush puppy should be.  Topped with bleu cheese crumbles and bacon and slightly spicy dipping sauce, be sure to order plenty.    For entrees one person got the Pot Roast... cooked to perfection with an amazing flavor and paired with perfect sweet carrot medallions. To die for.    One person got the Chicken a la King and Queen...no no no, please stop thinking of the stuff in a white sauce with peas, it was breast crisped and served with veggies and potato OMG so good!   I got the pork shoulder, so tender that each piece literally melted in my mouth, the collard greens were a level of perfection not attained by any i've ever had before, in fact the closest approximation was Southern Art in Atlanta and they were a distant second.    TEN is literally the perfect restaurant with a good, solid menu of dishes that are both amazing in their execution and so good you'll want seconds. The prices are very, very reasonable dinner for three with two beers and two wines with appetizers $100.  The service was so good as well that it made the wonderful experience stellar.  I can't wait to go back.   Oh, and the Chef is opening a Italian Restaurant next door, which I'm sure will be an amazing experience too, I can't wait to try it.    Rock on, Jeff...I'll be back every time I'm in town, promise.  TEN is an ELEVEN!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal with my wife. We sat at the bar and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food was fantastic and perfectly cooked. We will be back as it was just right for us"}
{"text":"Menu is small, but food is delicious! Their drink menu has a wide variety and good happy hour options! Service is good sand they offer to validate parking in the garage. Would highly recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! After a long day of traveling for work, I wanted a place to: (1) watch the playoff games, (2) have a cocktail or two, and (3) eat something good even though I wasn't hungry. Ten Handcrafted was the perfect spot. The food, drinks and service is ALWAYS consistent. I had the grapefruit basil drink (so yummy) and the pan-seared market fish (sea bass) which was AMAZING. Chef Jeff remembered me from a previous visit and came out to greet me making me feel welcomed and VIP-like (if that's a thing). The bartender, Amanda, was spot on with her meal recommendation and was easy to talk too...felt like I met a new friend. And Tom, the regular who I have seen there before, made me feel like I was in a modern day classy version of \"Cheers\" w/o the drama, cheesy and sometimes obnoxiousness.   When I need to unwind from the stress of my day and just be, drama-free, I'm coming to Ten Handcrafted!"}
{"text":"Hit the Happy Hour (4-6pm). We had every appetizer on the menu and all were great!   TIPS:  - If we had to choose, we'd skip the tomatoes but double down on the fish tacos and the shrimp grits cake.  - The Cucumber Gimlit and the Citrus Rush were both fresh and light cocktails. Go for the go the Midway if you'd like something with more bite.   Evan was a great server and all the staff were top notch!"}
{"text":"You almost want to ruin their perfect rating but there was absolutely nothing to complain about!  It's located right off the parking garage at the Esplanade.  They left the design and layout roughly the same as before.  Nothing too fancy, maybe a little on the masculine side but very comfortable and nice.    Service was awesome, everyone seems so friendly!  It was kind of like Winco - is everyone part owner?  I've never actually been but....  The happy hour is ridiculous!  I say they bought the raters off by having such great prices for their happy hour.  We seriously got one of everything and it came to about 20 bucks.  Cocktails are $5, all beers are $3 and their selection is pretty good.  They also have wines which is the going rate of $5 but I bet they don't try to give you crap wine but can't really say for sure.  Anyway, the prices are so low, I can't believe it wasn't packed to the gills.  The food selections themselves were all very delicious.  I tried the shrimp and gritcake, fried green tomatoes, beef tacos, fish tacos, and hush puppies.  They're all varying degrees of awesome.  We also got the steak and fries which was perfectly cooked to order.  Simply seasoned and super tender.  The fries were actually good!  Lately it seemed like everywhere we went, we got the limp skin on greasy fries reminiscent of the local grease spot.  So much so that I thought maybe it's a trendy thing right now (though not for me).  Not here - awesome, nicely cut and nicely fried with a bit of salt.  Perfect!  This is hands down my favorite happy hour spot.  I hope I don't eat them outta business!  ;)"}
{"text":"We stopped here while we were all dressed up, going to an event downtown. I thought it was a \"fancy\" restaurant, and it turned out to be a very casual location. But, what a delightful experience. The mojito's we had were amazingly delicious, and then I ordered an appetizer, the taco's. They were the juiciest pot roast I've had in years (reminds me of my Mom's) in a soft taco shell with a thick slab of bacon. Who would have thought of combining those two? They were outstanding! My wife and I want to go back and enjoy a full dinner at Ten when we have a chance in the near future. The only reason I knocked it down to four is that the interior of the restaurant was very brightly lit, and the table setup and atmosphere is much more like a bar or casual place than fine dining."}
{"text":"Delicious food and outstanding service. It has this old world European feel with a gourmet flair."}
{"text":"Fun delectable down home cooking with a true chef's flair! This ain't your Mamma's fried chicken or pot roast, it's way better! Sorry Mamma! The beers are stellar complemented by the atmosphere. Deserts are to die for, oh yeah, and the appetizers are rock stars!"}
{"text":"Came here randomly from being out of town and was blown away!! The drinks are amazing, service spectacular and food to die for! If this makes it easier I never write reviews and I am writing one now! Ask for Carmella she is a rock star!  Also Jake and Amanada are he best!!"}
{"text":"Great service... A bit toasty in the eating area. Greens and fried green tomatoes do not appear to be made in house.  Shrimp & polenta were underwhelming. Pork & pot roast decent.  Happy hour drinks were weak. This great location could become a fun neighborhood restaurant with a few tweaks."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were both good. I recommend reservations because it is a relatively small restaurant and can fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Very personable waitress and very helpful! Hush puppies are a must. Don't know why this hasn't caught on out west. They are topped w bleu cheese and bacon. Fried green tomatoes were so-so, breading did not stick. Ordered the ahi tuna, superb. Took a bite of pulled pork sandwich and greens. Sandwich topped w slaw and pepper jack, made for a good spin on s classic sandwich. Manhattan was delish to drink! A little on the pricey side for drinks, but will be back"}
{"text":"Joined a party of six at Ten last night.  Food was awesome and the service the best.  We had the Hush Puppies and Shrimp and grits appetizers.  Both were over the top, solid portions cooked to perfection and delicious.  For entrees we had the special (steak and shrimp) and the Pot Roast.  So good I woke up this morning thinking about when I can return.    Ambiance is perfect for a date or dinner with a group of friends.  No brainer, we will return."}
{"text":"This place deserves all the praise! I was nervous to have a restaurant I've never eaten at be the start of our dinner club but it was the best decision. All the girls loved it!! You know those meals where no one speaks the entire time they are eating? Yeah, that was us. Jeff, the owner and chef, really made the experience.  Service: impeccable  Ambience: stellar Food: shrimp and grits ($9) was on point! I had to give up a shrimp to get a bite of the short ribs and it was worth it, melt in your mouth. Kilt lifter $4 I couldn't resist. The only thing it was missing was more shareable appetizers. I felt most of the appetizers were entrées.   Prices: decent and we weren't there for happy hour, I bet those prices are great!   Must TRY!!"}
{"text":"As an update, I was contacted by management regarding my average review. I returned the call and have not heard back since (been a week now)... I think what irks me more now is this type of customer service. Always better to under-promise and over-deliver, don't you think?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with some co-workers, didn't even know this place was here. Smallish & off the beaten path but well worth it. I had the Pressed Cuban sandwich and it was Delicious. I will definitely be back(I want to try dinner). Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food.  Barbecue sandwich is one of the best I've had.  Also try the hush puppies.  Prices are great."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour this weekend and had a great experience!  Great atmosphere, great bartenders, great happy hour prices and appetizers too!  We enjoyed the shrimp and gritcake as well as the hush puppies...$8 total for both - what a deal.  We enjoyed 2 different $5 cocktails as well and were pleased with everything we tried.  The chef came out a couple of times and was really engaging and welcoming too."}
{"text":"We came here for my wife's birthday,  not only was the food amazing (best steak I have ever eaten).... but so was the service. They really mad our night special.  Thank you to all the Ten  Staff!!"}
{"text":"Had the buttermilk fried chicken and it was so good.  Reasonably priced for such good food.  From Chicago so I know good food."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. Small place, small menu, big portions!! Definitely chef driven. The hush puppies, pork shoulder entree,  and PB&J desert are not to be missed."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience, and service sums up Ten. I have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile and ended up going twice in a week for dinner. There is a quiet romantic upstairs and a more casual, lively downstairs dining areas, but you can't go wrong with either.  There is a decent cocktail, wine, and beer menu. Based solely on the name I ordered the Illusive Traveler Grapefruit Shandy, instead of my usual Cucumber Gimlet. The shandy is a light, refreshing, fruity sweet drink that I enjoyed but not for those who want/like beer.   The bacon, blue cheese, and dipping sauce were the perfect complement to the slightly sweet, crisp Hush Puppies. And for mains, the Pot Roast, Chicken Ala King and Queen, and Roasted Pork Shoulder were all flavorful, juicy proteins. I really enjoyed the chicken with its crispy skin, delicious gravy sauce on top of soft bread. I had it both times I went. The portion size is satisfying and I was too full for dessert.   Ten does validate parking for the ACE parking garage, which is a couple of minutes walk from the restaurant. Also the restaurant is a little hard to find because it's tucked away in a corner and surrounded by tall office buildings, but it is still worth searching for. I will definitely be back for dinner again.   What I recommend: - Hush Puppies - Chicken Ala King and Queen"}
{"text":"After reading reviews we had to check out this restaurant.  We are so glad that we did!  Friendly service from the moment we stepped in the door.  My husband who is very particular about his rum raved about the daiquiri.  Not a fruity daiquiri!  We started with the hush puppies with blue cheese and bacon sprinkles!  We devoured every crumb!  The chef recommended the pork shoulder. Excellent!  The collard greens were very tasty!  I had the blackened fish (rock) which was prepared perfectly!  We will be coming back!   The restaurant does sit back off the road.  Worth finding!"}
{"text":"So where to start. 1st....drinks were perfect. Handcrafted like your grandma used make peach cobbler. The love and attention to detail made me think of spring and long walks on the beach. Our server/ purveyor of witty dialogue and snappy retorts, Carmella, was the type of person you want to keep all to yourself but who's feathers are to bright to cage and you feel a social responsibility to set her free to the world. Our bartenders Bretton and Nicole set the world of mixology on fire with dazzling displays of simple meets secretive sophistication. Behind the scenes we had Jake. The little man with a mustache that deserves a bowl of soup and kiss from mom. All in all the experience was 1/2 three ring circus and Dining Chez Quis (save Ferris reference). We will certainly be back...for our bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Wow! A group of 7 went here for my birthday and were super impressed. We ordered a variety of drinks, apps, and entrees and all were highly enjoyed. We had a vegetarian friend and it was so pretty I almost wanted to trade her. They wrote me a birthday card and were very attentive. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I went a couple months ago for drinks with a friend and have been wanting to go back ever since.  Review is way overdue.    I tried a couple of different cocktails, but my favorite was the cucumber gimlet.  The chicken noodle was so delicious and felt like I was eating my mom's homemade soup.    Next time, I will have to try an entree and maybe an appetizer.  I remember the rest of the menu looking tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! I love this place! They take pride in EVERYTHING they do and want each customer to leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Accepted my reservation for 11 people, what an awkward number.  Great upstairs table.    Hushpuppies - apparently named because a HUSH fell over the table and we commenced to gobbling bite sized happiness that didn't need the tasty dip but since it was there.....  Haikus were being written about the various entrees we were so inspired! Every entree was praised and plates were licked clean. My personal delightful plate of Shrimp & Gritcake included a few slices of (andouille?) sausage that rounded out the flavor profile beautifully.  I added a side of wilted spinach and that was brilliant on my part - helped sop up the rest of the fabulous roux!  Jake our server was just delightful, we voted him in as 12th man for our table.  Will Be Back."}
{"text":"this place is a bit hard to find its tucked away in a business/office type complex there is complimentry valet parking when i walked in i took a seat at the bar because its what i do the first few minutes i sat at the bar there was no server/service that appeared the first few minutes a few of the kitchen staff stuck there heads out of the kitchen looked around with sour looks as i made direct eye contact with them there was no pleasentries exchanged but a few minutes later the best bar tender/wait person appeared she was bubbley ,charming and effeciant i had the cuban sandwich which was very good and a gin cucumber fluffy cocktail as well as the hush puppies ..... yummies ,i took half of the sandwich and the left over fries home"}
{"text":"Wow, this tiny neighborhood joint in the middle of the Camelback Esplanade getting rave reviews and for good reason.  Great prices, interesting and fantastic tasting food, friendly attentive service... What more could you ask? Always good, not a bad dish on the menu (have tried 6-7 dishes). Fresh fish changes almost daily and is a super bargain at current rate of $17! Yeah, 17 bux. The pork shoulder tonite was to die for! Finish the meal with a robust French press Coffee.  Say hello to Jeff the owner and chef.  It's getting crowded though you might need a reservation."}
{"text":"A group of 7 (four adults and three kids--an 11- and two 13-year-olds) went here for dinner last night.    We were met by the chef/owner, Tim, who talked to us and seated us, telling us about the specials.  In the course of talking, we learned that the chef butchers his own meat on site to create hamburgers, the pot roast, and steaks.  In fact, he gave us a great lesson on how \"Denver\" cuts came to  be.  In short, he knows his stuff and he's super charming.  The foodL we had orders of the hushpuppies (wow!), salads (both were amazing), steaks (cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth tender), hamburgers (all the boys' plates were clean).  We wanted to try the fish and pot roast and decided to do that on another visit.   We had the pbj, a la mode, a few scoops of ice cream, the pineapple, upside down butter cake, and the chocolate cake, a la mode.  We fought over them all and over which we liked the best.  There was no consensus winner, which in this case means they were all great.  The drink: the pinot grigio was tasty, the gin gimlets (with cucumbers) were tasty, albeit a little sweet (which they informed us they would be), and the old fashions were quite good.  Service was attentive, straightforward and strong.    Value: We had three steaks, two big salads, with shrimp,  two burgers, several orders of appetizers, multiple glasses of wine and four alcohol drinks, and lots of desert for  ~$200.  Given the area, the quality of the food, drinks, and desert, this was a pleasant surprise.  Happy hour has very good prices.   The chef/owner has something going here that is worth checking out.  We're going back."}
{"text":"As a family from SC in need of a taste of home while visiting AZ, we loved all the food and hospitality of TEN. The shrimp and gritcake showed off the chef's Lowcountry Charleston, SC roots, and our lunch of the BBQ pork and Cuban sandwiches were great. Our super friendly server even added some simple syrup so my daughter could get a jolt of sweet tea. Nice atmosphere even as it is tucked away next to the AMC theater amongst other office buildings. Y'all check out TEN when you can."}
{"text":"Back for round 2... same great experience and same great food. When for a Bday celebration and enjoyed a fantastic meal... again.  Will let the pics do some of the explaining, but let's just say the Hush puppies we fantastic... crunchy on outside but super moist and flavorful on inside.. dipping sauce made the difference. Must try!  The other appetizers pictured, shrimp and grits is my Faaav, and the fried green tomatoes were good, not great (needed to be a little more ripe).  The entrees, not pictured were excellent again, but this time I had to take a pic of the PB&J pizookie desert ...something you absolutely must try. Two piping hot peanut butter cookies, slathered with a berry jam in-between...served with vanilla bean ice cream and some candies peanuts. Enjoy!   Last, service and personality matter! They delivered."}
{"text":"Best Old Fashioned in the city.    Mules and such were fabulous as well.    Hush Puppies and Fried Green Tomatoes to start...   O-M-F-G the hush puppies are so ridiculously good.  On to Salmon and Pot Roast.  F--- me runnin'.  These guys can cook.    Seriously, this place (a bit tough to find buried in the Esplanade) is definitely one of our top 2-3 favorites in the whole city and we eat out a lot.   Got the fat ass to prove it."}
{"text":"I am a wifey to this Yelp holder and they have treated me, being a gluten-free gal, superbly. The owner/chef and the people who work here are sweet and phenomenal. The food is to die for. The heart behind this place when you know it, is special. A dream accomplished for a well deserved person who strives to cook well and care well for others. Special place and a favorite we can't deny in Phoenix!!! Also, the drinks are fabulous and creative... Pineapple Marg special is amazing."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work and wanted something unique and tasty for dinner and ended up at Ten. Yelp to the rescue again, this place totally did not suck!   First I started with a delicious manhattan at the small bar and watched a bit of the game (World Series, to be exact). The bartender was super friendly and it felt like a neighborhood bar experience.   But the food was much, much better than anything you'd get in a bar. I selected the roasted pork shoulder with sweet BBQ glaze and collards over mashed potatoes. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork and it was perhaps some of the tastiest pork I've had outside of a carnitas taco in a very long time. The meals are all midwestern in style but quality is definitely emphasized over quantity. I'd definitely eat here regularly if I lived in the area.   Very reasonably priced, as well. Big 5 stars for this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick dinner during a long night of work and ended up having the best fried chicken dish ever. Perfect and cozy ambience combined with amazing food. I will bring the wife next time!"}
{"text":"First time trying out Ten. The pot roast was amazing. Our dinner companions had a steak special which was also fabulous. The bartender waited on us and mixed up great drinks. We tried the American Mule, Moscow Mule and Mexican Mule. All were perfectly mixed. We had a blast, great intimate atmosphere!"}
{"text":"On a scale of 1 to 10, Ten Handcrafted American Fare & Spirits is definitely a TEN!  A solid 5 Yelp stars for me.  On a recent visit to AZ, I made reservations at this restaurant located in Camelback Esplanade and am so glad we chose to have dinner here.   Happy Hour or as it is known here, \"Decompress\" time starts early here, 2 p.m. to be exact, and it seems like a few women in the bar had been partaking since that time.  It goes on to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, so we were able to take advantage of the HH deals during our dinner meal which was awesome.  My refreshing Cucumber Gimlet was only 5 bucks. My tablemates also enjoyed the house Chardonnay and the delicious tequila and raspberry La Pinta cocktail. Our appetizers of Fried Green Tomatoes and Hush Puppies were also HH prices during our dinner.  Enjoyed both of these apps very much with the Hush Puppies being the favorite of the table.  These were fried doughs of goodness with bacon and blue cheese crumbles and Rouille dipping sauce.  So friggin good!  The menu has some wonderful offerings.  Owner/Chef, Jeff Hostenske grew up in the Midwest and went to culinary school in the South and his menu is  a reflection of so many of these regional influences.  I decided to go with the fresh fish of the day which was the Pan-Roasted Sea Bass.  This was fantastic!  The sea bass, itself, was delicious, but on top of a bed of roasted tomato, corn and green beans, OMG.  This accompanied the fish so well.  I left nothing on that plate!  We also enjoyed the Hand Cut Steak and Fries and Chicken Ala King and Queen at our table.  After reading how many Yelpers enjoyed the PB&J Ala Mode dessert, I knew I wanted to order it as I also love PB&J.  This lived up to the hype, no questions asked.  A soft, warm peanut buttery cookie with strawberry jam layered in it with ice cream on top.  This was seriously orgasmic.  So delicious!  Honestly, everything we ate here was fantastic and obviously a labor of love from the chef/owner.   Hannah, our server, was warm, helpful and enthusiastic.  All the staff here was terrific.  Kudos to the hard-working bartender, also, for the fantastic libations.  Awesome food and drinks, great atmosphere, terrific staff, all of these things make me want to return here again during a future visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our drinks, La Pinta and American Mule, and sandwiches, Pressed Cuban and Pulled Pork."}
{"text":"We were looking for something close to the office as it was really hot today and really humid and came across Ten.  It is hidden behind the AMC theatre in a business complex.  If you do not know about it, you will never see it.  Too bad on the location as this is a nice quaint establishment that serves simple but very good food, with awesome service!  A big shout out to Carmella who was our waitress.  She had our table in stitches and also made us feel at home.  It was a great change than your typical stuffy establishment.  We were served immediately and put in our orders.  The salads were done exactly as we asked so we were off to a great start.    Our entrees came in short order and it was a treat and a delight to eat!  The pan roasted fish was cooked to perfection and the taste was spot on.  The Chefs steak and fries were cooked to perfection.  I get very leery on steak at restaurants as no one knows how to season or cook the meat properly.  Ten has this done in spades!!  It was sliced and cooked perfectly.  I had them add some sauteed onions and that made the taste even better.  The Burger was HUGE and really good.  We had to finish the night with the brownie and ice cream.  A Huge portion of Ice Cream on a very nice brownie that is more than enough to share ended the meal just right.  We all really enjoyed our experience at Ten and would recommend everyone come and check it out.  It is worth finding this nice hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars  Food: 2 stars Cocktails: 3 stars  I feel bad leaving a 3 star considering how attentive the staff were. Not only did the manager come to check on us but so did the chef. I didn't have the heart to tell him how bad the food was. I'm sorry to say it was terrible.  We ordered a bunch of appys. Two types of the tacos, and the blue cheese bacon corn fritters.  The tacos were ruined by their choice in tortilla. They used these thick wheat sugary highly processed crap tortillas. It ruined the whole dish. The meat was good, but not wrapped in that. The corn fritters were burnt. Not just a little over cooked wither, I am talking black balls covered in blue cheese and bacon. Had I not missed lunch and not just gotten off a flight starving I would have sent them back. Again I feel bad for not saying anything but I was a little worried about hurting the chefs feelings; he did personally come out to say hi after all. With that we quickly finished our drinks, skipped dessert, and left for another bar.  Cocktails were okay, but lacked any real craft. They were simple stuff I could make at home myself, and they didn't make their own syrups with fresh herbs like I would have expected from a place with handcrafted in the name. The Gimlet I had was very average. I make mine with St. George Spirits Terroir Gin and homemade rosemary basil infused simple syrup. So my expectations may have been a tad high."}
{"text":"First time.  Here on business and found the place on Yelp.  270+ reviews with a 5 star rating.  I had to check it out.  It is well worth the trip.  The food is outstanding!!! OUTSTANDING!! Good craft beer selection.  Great relaxing ambience and the people here are good people.  A place you can tell the people who work there love what they do.  If you are in the area it is well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say other than the food and the service were amazing. I'm so happy to be in the neighborhood so I can come here all the time. One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Came here on a lark, and glad we did.   Casual dining yet gourmet fare to a T. The chef and owner obviously take pride in their establishment, and it shows, from the friendly, very attentive staff to the exceptionally tasty yet simple cuisine.   The place is fairly quiet (except for the bartender!), and seems to attract a younger, hip crowd. We can see why: very impressive date destination that won't break the budget! Speaking of which, a small but excellent wine selection as well.   \"Ten\" stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and lovely quaint atmosphere.  Love love love!  If you haven't been you must check it out.  Everything is made with fresh ingredients, great tasting, great value.  Carolann is a fantastic and well experienced server.  Make sure you ask for to be sat in her section, you wont be disappointed.  Cant wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"Quick version: Hometown friendliness, with a trendy tavern feel.  4 friends ventured in to try the burger and we will undoubtably be back to try the rest of the menu soon!  The owner stopped to genuinely ask if our meal was ok-(which was great) and staff was super on par! Can't wait for our next meal here!!"}
{"text":"Carmela and Amanda were great! We came in after close and they were still hospitable and let us stay for a birthday shot. We will definitely be coming back because we've heard so many amazing things about the food, and if the service is already this good, really I don't see how this place could go wrong. Thanks, Carmela and Amanda!  ...and a few days later... https://instagram.com/p/BfzqBRqhZ47/"}
{"text":"Waited for over an hour to get our food. Pot Roast, mashed potatoes, and boiled carrots.  Bad kitchen and service management.   How long does it take to plate up pot roast and mashed potatoes?  The \"manager\" was outside the restaurant chatting up a girl rather than taking care of his guests.   The food was okay but definitely not a Ten. The service was horrible."}
{"text":"Fantastic low key spot. Simple menu that fulfills the palate with flavor. Bartender was very charismatic.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. I highly highly recommend the burger as I honestly believe it is one of the best burgers I've ever had. Also the Cubano is great and filled with flavor. The thing that really makes this place amazing is the customer service. Evan was our waiter and he was so friendly and easy going and always greeted us with a smile. Jake is the manger and he is so nice and makes sure you leave full and happy. I can say this is one of the best places I've ever eaten at valley with an amazing staff! Highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food was great as well as the atmosphere. We had the best waitress (Carmella). She was friendly and she knew the menu and recommended an excellent meal. The food was great, but Carmella and the staff will make us come back."}
{"text":"Staff was great. Food was pretty good. Ordered the pot roast and it was a little dry. I will be back as I saw other tables with even better looking entrees"}
{"text":"This place was so nice! The atmosphere was small and intimate. I made a reservation for my coworkers and I, ordered from the happy hour menu. The food was.. outstanding. Talk about a high end happy hour for a great price! We ordered one of everything and it was all fantastic- fresh food, cooked to perfection, and as Gordon Ramsey would say, 'plated beautifully'. The hushpuppies were great, the shrimp was perfect, and I even ate the grits. The chef was out and about in the restaurant as any chef should be. The drinks were a good size for the price. The waitress seemed a little busy and overwhelmed as it filled up pretty quick, but I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm confused about the ratings here. I did not have a great experience.   First, the service was odd. Our server was coming on WAY too strong & making us feel unwelcome/uncomfortable. We asked if there were blue cheese stuffed olives and she said \"you're asking too many questions\" as she walked away. I am pretty sure she was trying to make a joke but our question never got answered (until the martini came and there were not blue cheese stuffed olives). She wasn't rude just... abrasive and combative. Maybe someone else's cup of tea but not ours.   The drinks were meh. I got the one with basil... which I really enjoyed because it didn't taste like alcohol at all - good for me but I think this would be a problem for others. My partner got the grey goose martini and later told me it was the worst he'd ever had and he thought they watered down their grey goose - maybe to get more out of the bottle? In addition, he LOVES olives and said the olives tasted old/off. Regardless, for $13 that drink was extremely disappointing.   The food was mixed reviews from us. My partner loved his burger and said the pickles tasted homemade and were delicious. I got the BBQ pulled pork and was very underwhelmed with that and my fries. I definitely wished they put more of that slaw on the top as it was the best part. It wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away like yelp led me to believe I would be.  All in all, I didn't hate my experience here but there's nothing pulling me back. They did look like they have a pretty good happy hour so maybe avoid dinner and have your first time here be for HH so you don't spend $60 to be left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"TEN, located at the foot of the escalators at The Esplanade has become one of these places that you know won't let you down.  We came for lunch the first time and surprised to to see an old friend Jodee behind the bar.  You all know her from Houston's and Hillstone where she was a mainstay and the excellent service she always provided.  She never lets us down.    Jeff, the convivial owner is an active front end manager and makes you feel like you are stepping into his home.  He explains his approach to satisfy his guests, knowledgeable bartenders that know their way around making excellent cocktails and true food from scratch.  Whether you order the pot roast, chicken noodle soup, chicken cordon bleu, hamburgers with fresh cut fries or any of the many items on the menu. you know you are getting fresh, well prepared real food.  Nothing is frozen here and you can taste it.   This cozy little place fits like a glove and the guests are as friendly as the staff, each asking you if you tried.......whatever they just had.  This is truly a remarkable dining experience that surprises you with its small size but overwhelms you with great food and friendly service.  Stop by and you will be pleased as I have on the several visits made there.  And don't forget to ask for the parking validation before you leave."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!   The chef waited on us personally and recommended the perfect dishes for everyone.   I will recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Delicious, who would have guessed  Ten Handcrafted American Fare & Spirits is nesseled away on the inside corner of the AMC Dining Theatre Complex. This place has a fun and casual atmosphere with first-class upscale food that is reasonably priced.    The moment we walked in the door is when the genuinely friendly welcome began. We were seated immediately and drinks arrived shortly after.  We started with appetizers of braised beef tacos, hush puppies (bacon and blue cheese), and  fried green tomatoes. The hush puppies were perfect, light and crisp with flavorful sauce, I could have finished the entire order myself.  Everything was prepared perfectly, and was absolutely delicious.    Our entrees consisted of pot roast which was flavorful, tender, over potatoes with carrot medallions; chicken ala king and the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. I, personally devoured the chicken ala king; which consisted of a crispy chicken breast sitting on top of a flavor drenched bread with wilted spinach and a tasty sauce. All our entrees were incredibly delicious.    As our night was coming to an end, we considered having more hush puppies for dessert but ended with the PB&J Blonde Brownie Ala Mode, perfect ending to a great dining experience.  The service is excellent, and the food is delicious. If you're in the area, stop by,  this is the place you have been looking for."}
{"text":"Hush puppies, chicken fried chicken and seared tuna tacos- delicious!!! Wonderful service and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience.  2 of our guest had the sea bass special and loved it. Hubby had the buttermilk chicken, another guest had the cordon blue sammie, I had the ribeye special.  All the meals were fantastic.  Drinks were spot on, Brandon provided excellent service. The ambiance is industrial/modern.  We sat upstairs.  Just really great place."}
{"text":"Truly a 5 star experience!!! Ten served up an amazing meal. We've never been before but live nextdoor and thought we'd try it out. The HUSH PUPPIES are to die for! And don't even get me started on the Pot Roast that melts in your mouth. You won't be disappointed. My partner and I chowed down leaving nothing but empty places. Probably not proper etiquette to use my finger to wipe the plate clean... but that's what I did. We ended the meal with the PB and J dessert that satisfied our need for something sweet. Can't say enough about this restaurant. Refills upon refills ready to go. Chef walking around to make sure everyone is enjoying their meal. And make sure to ask for ELIZABETH! She's truly a gem to this fine eatery. I give TEN a ten out of ten. I think it's clear that we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I'm going to go the other way of the crowd on Ten. The fresh fish on the menu was halibut and I'm not quite sure about the fresh part. The rest of the plate was good with French beans, corn and roasted tomatoes. It was $17. Actually the menu does look good and everything is reasonably priced. Service at the bar was good. It's a quaint place, everyone I saw was on the main level, there is a small loft. I didn't get to experience the handcrafted cocktail part, my drink was Tito's on the rocks."}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times over the past year and am happy to report that Ten is as good as ever, possibly even better if that's even possible.  Their cocktails are top notch and their fare is consistently damn near perfect .  .  . alright . . . perfect every time I eat there whether it's lunch, Happy Hour or dinner.  If you go for lunch or an early dinner, chances are you'll have a delightfully friendly lady named Jodee wait on you.  If you're lucky, she may even be tending bar and mix your cocktail for you as well.  Great Manhattans and the Cucumber Gimlet is as refreshing as dipping you toes in a cool running creek.  During my most recent visit with my wife, his son and girlfriend, we arrived well after lunch but before dinner which places you in a wonderful position vis a vis menu options - three to be exact.  Happy hour runs from 2 pm to 6pm and they have a specially priced menu for drinks and food.  The lunch menu is still available and if you take your time sipping those great cocktails and sampling some Happy Hour appetizers, you can also order from the extended dinner menu.  Whatever you order or which menu you order it from, you won't be disappointed.  I always order the Fried Green Tomatoes and Shrimp Grit cakes. Their fish tacos are equally terrific.  This time around, I tried the Cordon Bleu sandwich from the lunch menu which was not only delightfully tasty but very generous.  Great fries too. I was only able to eat half - too many Fried green tomatoes? My son ordered a sea bass special from the dinner menu and loved it.  This place rocks in my book and is hands down my favorite restaurant in the greater Phoenix area. Chef/Owner Jeff Hostenske has hit on an excellent mix of relaxed ambiance, service and high quality comfort food and drink with a southern flair.  Apparently a lot of others agree, including those with the power of publicity, i.e. Phoenix Magazine http://www.phoenixmag.com/food-reviews/ten.html  Try it and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed.  Oh, and you can't be their prices for dining at this level."}
{"text":"I almost gave this place 5 stars, but a few (very tiny) things held me back a bit.  First, it's in the Esplanade.  I have always found it annoying to park there and to find anything.  And yes, they do validate your parking- up to $6.  (*In case it helps any old-school Phoenix dwellers, this place used to be Nixon's.  Which I LOVED.)  Second, the food was really, REALLY good, but there just weren't a lot of options.  While I truly believe that it's better to do only a few dishes extremely well than to do 30 dishes half-cocked, I just wish there were more than 5 entrée items.  That being said, we had the pot roast and the salmon over yellow rice -- which was on special -- and both were pretty darn good.  Also, my friend and I told the server we were going to split both dishes, and the chef brought them to us himself, equally split and beautifully presented on 2 plates.  Now, again, the food was \"pretty darn good\"-- I had hoped that this was one of those places where I rave about the food to my friends and have a craving for something that I can specifically eat at Ten... but that wasn't the case.  Well, maybe the pot roast.  :)  Anyway, I do want to mention that since I had said it was my friend's birthday, they did comp us the 2 glasses of wine we ordered.  All in all, I really wish that I could give 4.5 stars, but you can't... and I try to reserve 5-star reviews for those places that I want to revisit about 2 minutes after I walk out.  *Ten also takes reservations, which I love.  Oh - one more random thing ---- I am a music snob and the music choice was AWESOME.  It definitely contributed to the atmosphere of the place, which was very \"industrial/Thomas Edison\" and great!"}
{"text":"Everything here was awesome! The food, service, appetizer... Everything. It was 3 of us and we shared the shrimp with sausage grit cake app (it was called something like that) and it was too good. I ordered the pork with greens and it was so tender and flavorful; the other food I tasted was great too. We sat us stairs which gave a great view. I'd definitely return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I was very excited about going here based on the great reviews. First I'd like to say that it was somewhat hard to find in the esplanade. There didn't seem to be much signage outside of the front door at all. Our food was just okay. I was disappointed to be honest. Nothing was bad, but nothing was good either. I had tacos that came with one fried egg. What do you do with one egg for two tacos? Just a little unusual. Another dish that was ordered at my table was the blue cheese hush puppies, which was the most disappointing of all. They were just regular hush puppies with blue cheese sprinkled on top, which just all fell off anyway. I can say the decor is cool and I'm sure it's a fine spot for a happy hour and a snack, but I don't know if I'd return for another forgettable dinner."}
{"text":"This place is worth seeking out!! The shrimp grit cakes and hush puppies . . . Oh, yeah! The owner/chef was kind and informative. He even shared suggestions for other happy hours for us to check out. Even though this is a tricky place to find, find it!"}
{"text":"4 solid stars. Hard to locate as if sits within a deserted movie theater complex. They validate parking, however. Came here while on business travel. Good food although choices on the menu are somewhat limited. Family owned, very personable staff. Service was fast. Overall a good experience. Would recommend the friend chicken with mash and bacon gravy. The hush puppies were also good."}
{"text":"I loved every part of this meal. My husband and I split the hush puppies, wedge salad, short rib, and brownie. Every part was so good I could have eaten a whole meal of just that. By the way there was plenty of food for 2 people and very reasonably priced considering how stuffed and satisfied we were. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes here. Also the service was amazing- we went for our wedding anniversary and we were greeted with a card signed by all of the staff and our dessert was free :)"}
{"text":"So I got the Skyline (Cincinnati) chili. It's a different version than any I've had, lighter on the chili and with thinner noodles and no beans. It was a little spicy for me, but if you love hot food, you'll love it. Overall, though, it had that right Skyline flavor and scratched the itch perfectly. The staff was really nice and friendly. The atmosphere is great and I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am seriously surprised anyone can give less than five stars when describing their experience at Ten. I can't help but wonder what could've possibly been so different from all of my experiences there, or what personal psychological  issues they have that they need to nitpick every little detail. I have been multiple times with family and friends who all describe this as one of their absolute favorite restaurants in town. From my very first visit, the service, food, and drinks have been flawless. The owner consistently has a presence in the restaurant, doing everything from greeting guests, delivering food, to busing tables. The energy, decor, staff, and most importantly food and beverage are phenomenal. This pot roast is life-changing. The old-fashioned and other cocktails are so well crafted...you can't go wrong with any choice. Take it from a foodie who loves to dine in Chicago, San Francisco, New York City, and here locally at all our great restaurants, this place is so worth it! Go! :)"}
{"text":"While waiting for a movie to start a buddy went on yelp to find a place for something quick to eat. We came across this amazing spot. What an awesome experience. The owner/chef Jeff was so polite and was great at explaining his way of thinking of putting his menu and restaurant together. His whole entire staff is polite and upbeat. Perfect setting in the restaurant. The ambiance and decor are perfect for his setup. The food is amazing and very authentic. I highly recommend the hush puppies and the Cuban sandwich. Perfect spot for a good lunch or a laid back and relaxed dinner. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went to Ten tonight during happy hour and the place was pretty much empty. My wife and I arrived around 4:30 so I don't know if it is normally like that or not but we were literally the only table for mostly the whole meal. Happy our prices were pretty legit. I got the American mule and it had a strong bourbon flavor and it was only 6 bucks! Not a bad deal at all. We got a few happy hour items such as the shrimp and grit cake along with the hush puppies and he braised beef tacos. Hush puppies were delicious and the sauce that they were served with was on point. Shrimp and grit cake was good but not great. Not enough flavor and I wish the grit cake wasn't so soggy from the sauce. We split an order of the fried chicken and this dish was fantastic! Really crispy chicken and it was still very moist on the inside. Huge portion too! At $17 bucks I thought it was overpriced but the portion completely justifies the price. Lastly, we finished up with the pb&j a la mode. I thought this was a pretty good dessert but my wife was not a fan of it. It is definitely a requirement to love peanut butter if you order this. Some bites were a little overwhelming with the peanut butter but other bites with the jelly and vanilla ice cream were delicious. Overall, I would totally come back here and try some other menu items. Very friendly service as well. Smaller restaurant too so you might want to keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Wish I could've stayed longer!   This hipster hole in the wall was fantastic. The atmosphere is lowkey and quiet. It feels like you can take a date here for a casual yet intimate evening. They were able to fit our party of 7 in without a reservation, but I wouldn't recommend that. My guess is that we just got lucky.  Menu is small but surprising. Great happy hour deals! Half priced appetizers from 2-6pm. Such a good deal.   Enjoyed the fish tacos and was surprised by the flavor. Everyone does a white fish with mango. Somehow, Ten did it differently. Maybe it was the pepper or the arugula that changed it up, but it was just great."}
{"text":"We are just getting to know Phoenix and are so happy to have discovered TEN. The atmosphere is perfect - cozy and casual, but feels a little special/indulgent. We were a group of 7 aged 19 to 51 years old and we all found something fantastic. Two pot roasts, 2 fish specials, a burger, a pulled pork, and a salad with chicken. All went home happy and content and we all want to go back soon - maybe even before we head back to the frozen tundra (Minnesota). Oh, and the cocktails were SO good. Loved this place. Can't wait to become a regular when visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful and memorable dining experience. We arrived with no reservations (unfortunately dining with our kids). Our server Hannah quickly charmed both boys who proclaimed the burger the best they had ever eaten. After confiscating some of the fries I can attest that they were delicious. Jeff (chef and owner) helped with our wine selections and making us feel at home. My pork shoulder entrée  was spectacular. My wife had the wedge salad which was generous enough for both of us with perfect amount of dressing and bacon.  She also has the shrimp and grit cake small plate which was incredible though spicy which we both very much enjoyed. I heartily recommend the dining experience here."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to try this restaurant. It's in the best location, great vibe,  and I will be back soon.  Next time I'm trying the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing chef, very personal, and this food is straight from the heart! During our visit the chef came to our table and shared his story and passion for the dishes he'd created. His pot roast was born from a family recipe that his 91 grandmother had been making, now passed down to him. The pork shoulder dish is by far one of the best bridges between rich savory pork and tang from the vinegar greens. Highly recommend for drinks, food, and a personal experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to. The food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the salmon and it was perfectly cooked as well as beautifully presented. My husband ordered the fried chicken and he couldn't stop raving about it. Add to that the service was above and beyond - the chef also came out to check on all the tables which I thought was such a personal touch. We yelped this place and decided to give it a try and were so glad we did. Totally will go back when in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"This place was very good!  Their service is top notch and the food is awesome.  Can't say much more for this place except believe the reviews"}
{"text":"Great service and very cool environment.  The dinning area seems like it used to be an old quaint bar turned into a modern small restaurant. Wish I could remember our server's name, he was awesome!  I came here for my birthday and ended up getting a dessert on the house; it was the PB&J dessert, very good.  I had a burger too which was pretty good, but a little under cooked.  I like my burgers well done.  I know some people refuse to cook well done because it \"ruins the taste\"...not sure if this was the case.  Either way, I'd come back, great place, probably wouldn't order the burger again, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Wow. Stopped in here 9/18 since it was National Burger day as a friend of mine told me about their burgers. The owner and chef Jeff welcomed us and brought us waters, menus, the beer, wine and cocktail lists. He also detailed out the style of the food of carefully blending midwest with southern comfort food. He then recommended the shrimp and grit cake appetizer as it perfectly represented his style. We immediately said yes and also ordered a beer (honey ale) and a cocktail (the Midway). Drinks arrived quickly followed by the shrimp and grit cake. I could have been happy eating those all night. Wow. Probably the best thing I've eaten this year. This is a must have! If you are there, even if just having a drink while waiting for a movie upstairs at the AMC, have this appetizer. The shrimp, amazingly seasoned and prepared perfectly, resting atop slices of andouille sausage and the buttermilk grit cake with a sauce I would have felt no shame in licking the plate clean not to miss any. Fortunately the grit cake was there to help do that. A perfect blend of flavors, spice, and baby tomatoes. A must have.  We ordered our entrees, the burger with bacon and the pork shoulder with collards. Upon arrival at the table, both were beautifully presented. The bun alone was a delight, with a silky smooth bronze tone and fluffy. The perfect size to encapsulate the burger and everything along with it. And it absorbed all those delicious juices I left dripping after every bite. The burger is at the top of my list. A fresh grind and hand formed.  The pork shoulder and collards over a bed of perfect mashed potatoes. The collards true to southern form, a touch of vinegar, paired with either the potatoes or the pork, mmm, can't wait to go back and have it again.  I always say the biggest compliment I could give to a menu item or restaurant is that I would come back and have it again tomorrow. This place I could eat at every day."}
{"text":"I went to TEN for the first time about a year ago. Without intent, it was during their evening Happy Hour - to which the server, Jake, was extremely explanatory, telling me and my party about all their very reasonable specials. He made me feel like I was a regular who spent big money, not a first time guest looking at the Happy Hour menu. Based on that first impression, and the fact the kitchen hit a grand slam with everything I ordered (Hush Puppies, Fried Green Tomatoes, Pulled Pork sandwich which still has my mouth water), I have been back many times. The prices are right, the atmosphere is light, comfortable, spacious, and energetic. The service is always friendly, welcoming and never robotic, and the team in the kitchen have crazy skills! TEN is a great little joint that hits the mark with everything they do, and they let you take most of your wallet home with you - which to me, is pretty great. Check it out - you'll be happy you did, the first time and the 100th time!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   No complaints on the food or service, i just wished there was a little bit more space as its a small spot.  The hush puppies were awesome, the pressed cuban was very good, and the burger was humongous."}
{"text":"Although I didn't love the restaurant, I was really impressed by the owner responding to my review on yelp. He genuinely cared about my concerns and only wants to improve his restaurant so that we come back."}
{"text":"Fabulous Cocktails and Delicious Food!! The Atmosphere, decor and staff are amazing! Plus love that their happy hour starts at 2pm! This place is a definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Disclosure - Latch ft. Sam Smith)  You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down You, you make me hungry even when you're not around If there are Pot Roasts, I will try to knock them down I'm going to Ten, bites, not I know what I have found  I feel we're close enough I wanna try out your lunch I think we're close enough Could I order at the bar, drinks!  Now you've got me in you place I order just a few (Bo Bites!) Got me singing with embrace I'm attending TEN with you (Bo Bites!)   Came here with a foodie mate on a Tuesday night to checkout what all the rave was about this place was getting.  Place definitely reminded of a 20's/30's era type place.  Could almost imagine Al Capone walking in here having a steak!  Jumping into the food we started with some Fried Green Tomatoes and Shrimp & Gritcakes.  I liked the breading and the texture of the tomatoes in the red pepper aioli giving it a slight kick.  The shrimp and grit cakes was okay since I thought it was mushy overall, but sauce made this dish pop!  Moving to the entrees we ordered the Pot Roast and the Pork Shoulders.  The pot roast was cooked to perfection, crusty outside coating with a soft and tender meat within.  Overall, a good'o classic American meal!  The Pork Shoulders which my mate ordered was what I thought I should have ordered.  I'm not a BBQ fan, but I really enjoyed the sweetness of the glaze on the pork shoulders.  The meat was very tender and laid on a bed of mashed potatoes.    In the end, the service was top notch thanks to our server and bartender Briton!  The food was good and overall cooked the way it should be, but nothing too unique.  In the end, great place to hang for small bites and drinks! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  This location has housed many many restaurants and I sure hope this one is very successful.  The menu is very simple with many types of items to choose from that should suit everyone's tastes.  Prices are very reasonable as well and although we did not partake in the happy hour it looks fabulous as well. There were three of us and we started with the fried green tomatoes which were lightly breaded and yummy!  Two had the fish special which was Ahi and it was huge and for only $18.  The other dish was the fish tacos which was on the appetizer side of the menu.  Two tacos loaded with blackened Ahi.  It was more than enough to fill you up. I made my reservation through the Yelp seat me service, received a confirmation instantly of the reservation and then about 15 minutes prior to the reservation I received a very simple text asking me to either confirm or cancel the reservation.   Our server was Jake.  He approached us right away with waters and took our drink orders then explained the specials.  He was within reach whenever we needed him but gave us our privacy. This is a location that is really good for either a before or after movie or just if you are dining out for the night.  I would highly recommend trying Ten out and we will be back for sure in the near future.   Good Job Ten!"}
{"text":"Wonderful drinks, food, ambiance, and service. The whole staff worked together flawlessly to make us feel comfortable and well taken care of. We had fish tacos, the burger, fries, the Cuban sandwich, and fish of the day. All of it was perfection! You cannot go wrong here. Accommodated all of our changes to a couple of the items with no problem. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance, especially upstairs. Away from busy downstairs crowds, just hold on to hand rails when walking down.  We started with shrimp and grits cake. Slightly spicy, nicely flavored. I liked the texture of the grits, when eat with shrimp, different textures of food mixed together to create a harmony. Just be careful, red sauce from the dish could make a mess on the table.. Or was it just me, messy eater? A server came to clean my side of table when he came to take the empty plate.  We ordered another appetizer after finished eating the shrimp. Beef tacos was.... I think what happened was shrimp was so flavorful, beef tacos tasted so plain, also thought beef was a bit dry. A bit runny fried egg added nice flavor, although it made a mess on my hand.   After I made mess on the table, and then my hand, I stayed clean. I used my fork properly to eat main dish. After two appetizer, we decided split the main dish, they separated the plate when served, oh I know that's why I ate food without making mess, lol. Fish was grilled perfectly, nice texture outside but juicy and soft inside. Saltiness of fish and sweetness of corn went well together. Also enjoyed fresh arugula and green beans. It just just so pleasant eating this fish dish, I would order again.  For desert, we ordered tiramisu. We were just talking how tiramisu, using the same ingredients, they all make different and taste different. My best tiramisu was at Frankfurt.. followed by the one in Rome... One time I ate tiramisu every day for two weeks.. Always love the texture of mascarpone cheese and cocoa flavor. Unfortunately, their tiramisu had a tad too much cinnamon too it, overwhelmed and couldn't taste the cocoa as much as I wanted. Also tasted more sponge cake then mascarpone, cake part wasn't as moist as I was hoping.  Service was excellent. Friendly and attentive. Overall, I enjoyed the night. Nice casual ambiance, I would come back again  If you park in the garage next to the theater, ask for validation ticket. It's good for 2 hours."}
{"text":"Go here and love it. As we did.   Made a quick reservation on Yelp. Walked in and were greeted by the chef/owner Jeff. Not sure he planned it but it was a welcome among welcomes. He smiled, cracked a joke and set the mood for a great meal. We sat at the bar, as we do!  It was awesome. We requested a change to the tv. We were greeted with smiles and jeers...both welcome and both made us feel like we were home.   The bartender recommended a couple of great beers as well as food ideas. The Fried green tomatoes are a must. Hush puppies too. The winner for us both was the pork shoulder. This dish was drop your fork and talk about it good...so so good. Falls apart and is amazing. Do it.   The vibe is cool and the staff are cooler. I don't live in Phoenix. If I did this place would see a ton of me."}
{"text":"I met a business contact here for lunch recently. The place is really small so I strongly recommend making a reservation - which they will do for a group of 2. I had the pulled pork and it was excellent.  Even though the place is small and busy, we never felt rushed. I really enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Came here on a date and it was fantastic a week later I brought my mom and aunt back and we all loved it!    The service is always on spot and they are super friendly. I adore the bartender and all the service staff.   The food is on spot and absolutely wonderful! Both times it was perfect and consistent.   The drinks are perfect. Balanced. Fresh. Simple. Unique.   I highly recommend you trying this restaurant. Make sure u don't need reservations. Weekends I'd recommend them. Small unique place and wonderful atmosphere.    Good for dinner. Snacks or just drinks."}
{"text":"It was our first time in. My husband is a vegetarian and left a note on our reservation that he was. The atmosphere was awesome, and the staff was friendly. I ordered the steak, which was cooked beautifully, and my husband mentioned that he was the vegetarian on the reservation. The chef prepared an off-menu meal that was delicious for my husband. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it for dinner a couple of Fridays ago with one of my Yelp friends.  The downstairs area is kind of busy with dining tables, the bar and servers coming and going from the kitchen.  The upstairs area is quieter with just a handful of tables. We were upstairs but I can see coming back sometime by myself and sitting at the bar.  Service was really good and the menu was interesting.  The first course of shrimp and grits may have been my favorite.  The spices and seasoning were excellent and this was a fine example of Southern comfort food.  The next course was the braised beef tacos served with a fried egg.  The presentation was beautiful and it was fun to eat it covered in runny egg yolk.  I thought it could have had a little more spice as all the flavors kind of blended together.  We split the nice flaky white fish entree and it was very good paired with the corn and crunchy green beans.  I really appreciated that they split the entree for us in the kitchen without being asked and plated both servings beautifully.   For dessert we had the tiramisu.  It was probably the largest single serving of tiramisu that I've ever encountered.  While it was very good I think I'd rather have a little more mascarpone and a little less cake/lady fingers.  They also have a nice wine list and eclectic and diverse craft beer selection.  This is a fun place with good food and friendly, knowledgeable service.  I'm glad Ten is part of the Phoenix dining scene."}
{"text":"I work at the Esplanade and have been to TEN at least 10-15 times since they opened...A lot of restaurants come and go here at Camelback Esplanade and TEN is here to stay.  Chef/Owner Jeff Hostenske is a solid guy with such a passion for food and hospitality.  Chef spent a fair amount of time working in the low country of South Carolina and that southern influence shows up in both the food and the service...every dish I've had is superb.  He usually has a cool 'special' that is always worth trying (daily).  Fresh, seasonal ingredients - farm to table.  Friendly staff.  Fun place to hang out. Awesome Happy Hour - 1/2 priced apps, $3 beers and $5 cocktails.  If you're thinking about eating at the AMC theatre, OMGoodness, do yourself a favor and pass on the grossly-overpriced theatre fare and eat here...its right at the base of the escalator."}
{"text":"Awesome ... Everything is soo yummy!! We started out with the house red wines (Merlot & cab) and fried green tomatoes YUM YUM YUM!! Then had the wedge salad the buttermilk dressing is so delicious...again YUM!! Our entrée was the cuben sandwich...holly crap awesome !! Crispy and delicious and the fresh pickle made the whole sandwich!!  If you are the area you have to try this place out!!!  And the service is top notch!!"}
{"text":"Strong food, beautiful presentation, delightful atmosphere. Hard to find initially if not from the area, but worth a visit. Chef even stopped by the table after our meal - not a common experience at a restaurant in this price range. Felt comfortable and welcoming. Burger was fantastic and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really quaint and full of interesting decor. We chose to sit upstairs and were promptly greeted by our server who said he would be right back with menus.  Well, right back apparently meant that he was going to completely forget about us for ten minutes.  Finally another server saw us awkwardly sitting there and brought us menus.  From the time it took us to sit down and get our first beverages it was 20 minutes.  Not a great start.   We started off with two specialty cocktails,  both of which were just okay. The bartender gave a lousy pour. We changed to wine and that was much better.   For food,  we ordered the hush puppies as an appetizer and the steak and fries and pork belly for our entrees. The only part of the food that I absolutely loved was the meat (on both entrees), which was cooked to absolute perfection.  Everything else on the plates seemed like afterthoughts.  I think they could step up their game a bit.  We might be back again in the future to try other options,  but it won't be in any type of hurry."}
{"text":"Really good food and a nice atmosphere -- right next to the movies and the happy hour starts at 2!!! Perfect and early"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight... wow! One of the best burgers I've had... ever. Got it breakfast style. Bretton was awesome, Carmella was amazing, Nicole rocked. And Jake? Fuck yeah.   Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here just for drinks with my friends that were in town visiting. We order cocktails and french fries. The drinks were really good. They had set cocktails but also had a pretty good list of beer and wines. I for the life of me cannot remember the name of my drink. I think it was Clapped Basil? The main flavors in the drink were: elderflower, grapefruit, and basil. The basil leaves in the drink gave it a really fresh component. The flavors flowed really well from start to finish. My one friend got the mojito and she preferred my drink over hers even though she thought hers was good. The french fries were really good. The outside was golden and crispy, while the inside was fluffy. Our waiter was really nice and helpful. Anything he didn't know the answer to like \"can I buy this beer at the store?\" (which is not a thing he should have known), he took time to look it up to give us an answer!"}
{"text":"As much as we wanted to love this place .... It is in now way a 4.9. Service was good. Very friendly and nice. It's cute in there too .... But the food is awful... With the exception of the chicken soup. We had the shrimp and grits due to the review.... Over Salted and rubbery.... The friend green tomatoes tasted old and salty and the burger literally tasted like something on it went bad.... I would not recommend unless you are only having a drink before a movie."}
{"text":"Cute place but not an eating place for vegetarians!  Very disappointed in the choices and the salad fixins were sad.  Lettuce looked as if it had been picked out of a plastic bag. Not even rinsed to be crisp.    Left hungry."}
{"text":"So my fiancé and I had walked by this place numerous times on our way to the AMC Esplanade. We were always curious about it and when a deal popped up on Living Social for it we couldn't pass it up.   As soon as we walked in the staff was super friendly. It's an intimate setting with a nice bar and really cool lighting. We ordered a couple of cocktails (old fashioneds) and my goodness they were delicious. They make their drinks strong and extremely flavorful. We ordered an appetizer. We got the hush puppies and they were scrumptious. The dipping sauce they came with was so good that you could dunk a flip flop in there and it would be one delicious flip flop. The chef came out and chatted it up with us and recommended the shrimp & grits appetizer. I really wanted to get that instead of the hush puppies but for whatever reason the Mrs. just doesn't like shrimp at all. Something about the texture. The chef insisted that I try it and made one just for me on the house! It was unbelievable. It had andouille sausage in it with sun dried tomatoes and the grits are actually grit pancakes. They were amazing. He came out to ask me what I thought and I stood up and hugged him. Not even kidding.   So the Mrs. Ordered the king & queen chicken dish and I ordered the pot roast. Good Lord they were both absolutely amazing. I was going to take a picture of mine but I inhaled my food before I could whip my phone out. Luckily the Mrs. was able to take a picture of her dish and as beautiful as it looked it tasted even better.  For dessert we ordered the PB&J a la mode. It gave me a foodgasm. Sofa king good. We demolished it in record time.  The service was phenomenal. The window air units were on and we were getting a little chilly and our waiter promptly turned it off for us.   This just became my favorite restaurant in the valley and a must for anybody who wants to reward their taste buds.mor anybody who has taste buds in general."}
{"text":"Meeting up with my gfs!  We came in time for happy hour!  Drinks and food on the HH menu.  A little cozy place and the staff was very nice!!   I got the braised beef tacos (baby greens, fried egg, and bacon)...  VERY VERY VERY GOOD.  Of course that is only the appetizer!  LOL.  I also ordered the Cordon Bleu Sandwich...  It was delicious and HUGE.  I only make a dent in it.    I'll most definitely be back for soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had the pork shoulder roast with mashed potatoes and creamy corn and it was delicious! For dessert I had the PB&Jelly a la mode and it was heavenly!"}
{"text":"Great apps by the bar.  Shrimp and Gritcake was worth the trip.  Friendly staff!!  Deserves your business."}
{"text":"Top notch. We stopped in here after a Saturday night movie with no reservation. The owner/chef greeted and seated us. Server was delightful and let us pace our meal. Ladies enjoyed their cocktails and the men enjoyed our beers (good craft beer selection, but no beers on draft). Great comfort food/upscale bar food at reasonable prices. We ordered a mix of appetizers (fish tacos, hush puppies and fries were all terrific) and sandwiches. My friend raved about his Cubano, and my pulled pork sandwich was outstanding; tons of meat, tasty sauce & crispy slaw on a great brioche bun. Substitute the homemade chicken noodle soup for the fries, it's phenomenal. Owner/chef stopped by to check on us and chatted us up -- PRO TIP: That's how you grow your business, kids. I'll be delighted to go back and recommend this place to everyone. Next time, we'll explore the entrees; the pot roast looked amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! We come here all the time, and we love to bring friends as well. Everything is great, from the ambiance to the always stellar and warm service. The drinks are great, and so are the appetizers, so make sure you start with both. I always get the fish, which never disappoints, and my boyfriend has the steak or some of their sandwiches which he loves. This is really one of my favorite places around ... I crave their fish now that we moved to the south Valley, but we are willing to make the drive for special occasions, and it never disappoints.  The only tricky part can be finding this place - park in the structure, they validate - and it is to the west of the movie theater.  Go and enjoy, you'll be so glad you gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fun atmosphere and we were fortunate enough to get two seats at the bar. Breton, our bartender, was a lot of fun and spot on with service. The owner took time to come out and talk with us and the whole place was energetic. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend Ten Handcrafted to everyone."}
{"text":"Took the In Laws here before Thanksgiving - WOW is all I can say about this place.  The owner/chef visits with all the tables and his take on southern cusine with a twist is amazing.  I had grouper with a hollandaise that was just out of this world.  We shared the tacos, shrimp/grits, fried green tomatoes, and hush puppies to start.  I have never had a hush puppie that delicious.  The drinks are fabulous, very gastro pub and \"mix ologist\".  We will definitely be going back to this place.  Happy hour is great!"}
{"text":"We're from San Diego and yelped to find this gem. Cool ambiance, Jeff (the owner) opened the door for us as we came in from the sweltering heat and it was the most casual yet pristine experience. We split the shrimp appy recommended (with an amazing sauce sitting on some grits), wedge and chop salad were best we've ever had (&we eat out 5 nights/week), HH drinks were not only well priced, but ridiculously good! Pork shoulder and Tilapia for dinner which were incredible. Worse part of the night was not having enough room for the delicious looking chocolate cake. Parking was a breeze and was validated. But all the individuals that worked there put their customers in the friend category, joking, socializing and generally making you feel so comfortable. Diverse group of people and best dining experience I have had in Phx. We will be telling all our friends who live here. No way you can have anything but a great experience at Ten. Mwuahhh."}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp! My week was grueling and I needed \"Happy Hour\" time BIG TIME, but I wanted somewhere different so I pulled up my yelp app and had bookmarked this place.   It is so close to me so I was already happy about that and I needed some alcohol to relax me and get rid of this anxiety I have. This place is to the left of SOLO and it is such a cute, quaint, adorable, earthy, rustic place - I love it!  Our server/host was awesome! He tells us about happy hour and the drink specials. We decided on the shrimp gritcake, the fish tacos, and the hush puppies. Everything was good.   My drink was the Midway - Berry Vodka, Lemon, Sprite, Sugar. I highly recommend! It was yummy and it did it's job! I was happy, smiling, and laughing at my stupid jokes. Its exactly what I needed!  The bill including tip ran less than $30 (3 appetizers,1 specialty drink, and 2 beers) The server asked if we needed parking validated.   5 Stars for food, drinks, price, location, and service!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. I never leave reviews but this place was very impressive. Small menu"}
{"text":"Let's begin at the end.  Dessert was a divine, made with actual flour and fantastic, creamy frosting, chocolate cake.  Not the impostor, flour-less chocolate cake found on so many other menus.  Dinner for me was a cooked to perfection, cod fillet, with nice veggies. Had nice citrus notes and a sweet potato coulis.  The companion had a fabulous cuban sandwich.  Overall a great meal.  Great food in a bistro type atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped by to celebrate our special occasion - the servers were very friendly excited for us, and made us feel very special. Cocktails were strong and my fish tacos were delicious. Will definitely return - maybe check out the happy hours next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time. I will start with the highlight -- the cocktails are incredible. We got the Cuban and the burger - of the two the burger wins the day! The food was good, but not the best I have had in the area. The music was odd for the establishment...really my only negative comment."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot my brother found on yelp after our massage appointment.  I'm visiting from Hawaii and Ten was so delightfully refreshing with flavorful heart warming food.   I ordered the pork shoulder and it was so juicy and tender. I usually like to add Sriracha on my meat dishes; which the waitress was nice enough to provide but after taking one bite of my dish... It was so yummy and flavorful that I didn't need to add anything.   Also, love industrial interiors with brick walls. I can't wait to visit this place again when I'm back in AZ!"}
{"text":"Me and my assistant came to this place for dinner and first thing I couldn't find parking for my oversized truck. So I parked in a spot I wasn't supposed to park in. I told the owner and he told security for me. When we sat down I ordered some wine that was recommended by the waiter and he was spot on it was a house brand I think and it was wonderful. We then had some kind of appetizer that was some kind of little fried balls, they also were wonderful. Then the waiter suggested the house special fish, again I don't remember the name of it but it also was great. You can tell the entire staff really cares and does a excellent job"}
{"text":"Cute location, parking is a pain, but a t least they validate first 2 hrs.  Great dinner entrees, good service.  Wanted more of a wine selection by the glass and on happy hour, overall fun joint."}
{"text":"Really awesome burger place.  Had the burger which was super juicy and the fresh brioche bun soaked up all the goodness.  The fries really made the meal though.  I don't know what they were tossed in but I could come back just for the fries!!"}
{"text":"Ok I admit it, they are trying too hard.  But guess what, it works.  Spinach salad with chicken was super creative and on point.  Couple that with work their weight in gold - the joannies  servers and this place is can't miss for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome little place dipped off in the Esplanade.  Really good drink specials and cool drinks on their menu.  This location has always been an awesome set up and glad to see it brought back to life.  When I went the drinks were on point (actually muddled and not some generic mixer), the staff was attentive and nice, and like I said previously they had some great specials going on.  I would definitely suggest stopping in before or after a movie for a cocktail or just make it your happy hour destination."}
{"text":"My wife and I headed down from Sedona and had a couple of hours before the flight home. Decided to stop in and have lunch here.  The bartender was Britton and we started out with the American Mule and LaPinta.  Fantastic drinks.  Britton took really good care of us.  We had the hush puppies, cordon blue and the cuban.  Fantastic food and drinks.  A great atmosphere.  A definite repeat. Jeff the chef and owner came out and talk with us.  I like the place and the food and drinks.  I will be back.  Jeff, open your second place in Redlands, CA!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and both times my drink and food was on point.  We need more places like this in the area."}
{"text":"A small  cozy restaurant serving high quality, hand-crafted American chow hidden away deep in a soulless office park.  We selected this spot based on the reviews but had a hard time finding it after google announced \"you've arrived!\"  Best bet is to park in the office tower ramp, find the stairs and walk down.  Then walk around to your left through the cavernous office towers and stumble across this tiny place on your left-there was a chalkboard pointing the way the night we dined.  The menu here is heavy on comfort food from the Midwest and south and the portions are mammoth.  We split a chopped salad with a sweet dressing covering super fresh vegetables that could have served 3-4 as a starter.  My wife's burger was tasty but more than she could finish at a half pound.  My huge fried chicken breast was well seasoned with a delectable crispy crust and came with a large mound of creamy mashed potatoes and a generous helping of spicy green beans.  Other than the difficulty in finding the place, I had no complaints and enjoyed the cozy, Irish pub-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and decided on Ten through Yelp reviews.  And couldn't have been happier with the entire experience.  Food, atmosphere and service were fantastic throughout the entire meal.  One of the servers jumped right in to our groups banter, who later we found out was one of the owner/chefs, Jeff, adding a truly special twist on the night.  Loved it all and would go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better dinner spot.  Nothing fancy here but the simple dishes are cooked to perfection.  Recommend the hush puppies, roasted fish, and pot roast."}
{"text":"Came here for HH with a friend and was very satisfied with the experience.   Server was sweet and attentive. The place is tucked away in the Esplanade  and is pretty small but cozy! There appears to be more seating upstairs.   I ordered the Cucumber Gimlet which I'm pretty sure I received on happy hour price for $5. It was delicious! I make these at home all the time and so I know a good one- it was on par.  My friend ordered their house Chardonnay which was also on happy hour for $5 and enjoyed that. The hushpuppies were a nice little snack as well.  Also, they do validate for parking!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! The service is awesome.  They know how to keep their customers delighted.  The food is absolutely amazing. I had a great time there. Would absolutely come back again. Wanna try all the dishes in their menu."}
{"text":"First impression is that this place was a quaint, small yet cozy little bar.  We had a great waitress, that was very attentive and super nice.  Since my husband and I weren't that hungry, we decided to just get some appetizers and a  salad (for me) and a soup (for him).  The fish tacos were AMAZING and the fried green tomatoes were also great (if you liked corn meal which was in the batter).  I didn't fault the fried green tomatoes for the batter, because aside from the batter, I really did like the flavor.  The soup was definitely homemade and tasted great.  I only detracted the star because I couldn't give them a fractional star (I would have given it a 4.5 star rating, definitely not a 4, but no choices in this, sorry).  I faulted them (only slightly, btw) because the spinach and goat cheese salad had only miniscule dollops of goat cheese (which is too bad because the cheese was delicious!) spread around the top and there was cole slaw type cabbage in the salad which threw the whole taste of the salad off.  It was an ok salad, but I'm a goat cheese (and spinach) lover and was so disappointed that there wasn't that much cheese.  Overall, the great appetizers made a great meal so I'm not too disappointed in the food.  As a New Yorker, this is saying something! I will definitely try to stop by the next time I'm in Phoenix and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"So good! Salmon special, pot roast, spinach and apple salad, and PB & J Alta mode....will be back! Great service!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!  The food was AMAZING!!  We had the fish tacos to start....perfection!!  Not your typical fish taco!  I had the Chicken al la King and it was SO tasty!  Must try! My husband had the special which was Sea Bas with Ratatouille and it was out of this world delicious!  The bartender (Brenton..sp?) was awesome!  We tried 4 different drinks from the menu, they were very well balanced and delicious!  The staff was very friendly from the moment we walked in the door.  The service was wonderful!  We will be back, can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely awesome. Jody (bartender and server) was always attentive to our needs (my parents were visiting, and could not stop ranting about the service, she truly made them feel spoiled). The Fried Green Tomatoes, and Hush Puppies were off the hook. It was lunch so three of us ordered burgers (OMG!!! Not only should this Mountain have it's own name for how flipping big they were, but it was  delicious, as well). The Chicken Cordon Blu Sandwich (mom ordered), was amazing. The. Crunchy breading on the breast complimented the sandwich perfectly. We only saw downstairs, but the atmosphere and ambiance were wonderful. This has an amazing feel as a down home neighborhood restaurant/bar. With me just relocating from Alaska to Phoenix, some places have been a little overwhelming. Great job! I will be back and look forward to having this amazing pot roast I keep hearing about. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and service is on point every time. Very impressed with this place and so happy it's in the neighborhood. Love the Cuban sandwich and Gin Gimlet."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't normally leave Yelp reviews (this might be my second), but I feel compelled to for these guys. Everything about this place is on point... space, service, atmosphere, music, drinks, food. I got the Steak and Fries... the meat and fries were perfect. The attention to detail and keeping the customer happy were second to none. Good TV placement to catch a game. This is an instant favorite in my book... go here!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! This is a true gem. We look forward to visiting at least once a week. Everything on the menu is phenomenal. Personal fave is the gritcake and chicken entree."}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday for a buddy's birthday. Food and service were killer. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hyper attentive service punctuates this thoughtfully prepared food and wine list.  I had the pot roast ($18), which fell apart with light teasing with a fork.  Served with mashed potatoes and carrots, both of which were good but unremarkable. I've been to Phoenix 3 times in the past year and this was good enough to hit all 3 visits.  The house cabernet is flavorful and a great value at just $5/glass. The chef comes with a notable pedigree (though I will do no more than note it!) and obviously cares a lot about his craft.  Staff is chatty and engaging."}
{"text":"Amazing. 5stars EVERY TIME!  Best burger in Phx, and we've tried a LOT...  Chicken ala King and Queen is delicious. Can't go wrong w apps like hush puppies, shrimp n gritcake and the stand out friend green tomatoes. Personal and friendly service on top of great food!??!!  A Phoenix GEM!!!!"}
{"text":"Gr8 food, gr8 service!  I just had a hankerin' for a wedge salad and found this restaurant  on Yelp. The helpful waiter suggested splitting the salad and the steak special with my friend . What a tasty combo ... plus I didn't walk away feeling overfull. The menu had so many other items I want check out at a later date."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with some co-workers base on the reviews and we were not disappointed! First off the service was great. We were seated right away and our server (can't remember her name but she had red hair) was sweet and attentive. The cucumber gimlet is fantastic. We split the shrimp and grits and we're pleased to see that they were not drown in sauce. All of our entrees were cooked to order and delicious. Will absolutely recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am so happy to see that the quality at Ten is just the same as it was when I first dined here years ago!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix on Business and ran across this place on yelp. Worth every star in their rating"}
{"text":"The best wedge salad with chicken that I have ever had!  I have been back 5 more times and the menu does not disappoint.  It might be a little hard to find your car in that crazy Esplanade parking garage but.... it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Food and service were both well above par and the vibe of the whole place as great. Somewhere we will go again and again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for lunch!  Great food and service!  Get the hush puppies,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary was to spicy! But other then that a fun place. Cool upstairs down stairs split restaurant with bar. We went Friday around 8:45 and it was not busy at all. Yummy salads and burgerS!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it never disappoints! The owner has paid attention to all the details to make the dining experience a pleasant one. The restaurant is funky and inviting, and the guest is always greeted at the door. The wait staff is friendly, and professional. But really, one comes here for the food. I have tried most of the appetizers and they are all terrific. Even the greens that come with the delicious fish taco are perfectly dressed. At my last visit, I had the fish, and it was simple but oh so tasty. Tonight I had the burger and it was perfectly cooked and a great burger. The prices are reasonable and the owner is always there to make sure that the dining experience is a positive one. The name ten couldn't be more perfect!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the boyfriend before a movie. The food was great! I had the fish of the day, blackened Chilean Sea Bass. The boyfriend had chicken noodle soup and Cubano sandwich. I loved my hand crafted cocktail with fluffy egg white (does that count as a protein shake? LOL). Super friendly service and spot on recommendations from Carmella."}
{"text":"Their name is fitting for this restaurant and I give it a 10! The cocktails, food, and service are outstanding! The Hush Puppies with blue cheese are so yummy that I have been craving them since I left. The \"Wedge\" Salad was presented in a beautiful way and it tasted like a \"Wedge from Heaven!\"  Cocktails are crafted and blended perfectly!"}
{"text":"This place is not super convenient to get to but it's worth it.  The ambiance is awesome, the service is great and the food is spectacular.  We took a large group and EVERYONE in our group enjoyed their meal.  There isn't a bad thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to go to Ten and I walked in just as happy hour was starting.  As a result, this review will be for the happy hour offerings.  From 2p-6p they offer their \"decompress\" menu which is what a hipster calls happy hour I guess.  Whatever, the offers were great.  There are about 5 apps on the list that are discounted from their normal menu price.  I tried the fish tacos, hush puppies, fried green tomatoes, and the shrimp and grit cake.  All of those items were very good with the hush puppies being my favorite and the tomatoes being my least favorite.  The portions are solid and the quality of the food is excellent.  Lots of flavor and great presentation to boot.    On the drink side of things they offer several cocktails and $3 beers.  All the beers are bottled or canned but the selection is very good.    Service is attentive as you would expect in a small space like this.    Overall it was an outstanding value and I look forward to more \"decompression\" and trying them out for a proper dinner.    Regarding parking - avoid the garage and utilize the free valet in front of Del Frisco's."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based on the reviews. It was even better than expected. Waitress Joedee has a dynamic personality and enhanced the entire dining experience . The fish tacos were delicious. Mango chutney  gave the dish  great flavor. The hushpuppies had a unique taste and were definitely homemade. Bravo to the chef the pulled pork sandwich was outstanding. Fries cooked perfectly crisp as we requested. Definitely try this if u r in the neighborhood and even if you are not!"}
{"text":"The staff and food was outstanding.  The owner and chef personally checked on our dinner and we really appreciated the great service, food quality, and atmosphere.  They had an outstanding wine list with so many great wines in every price range.  The food was great and the prices were very reasonable.  This is a perfect place after an AMC movie as it is right below the theater at the Esplanade.  There were so many good choices, we will go back many times to try the other dishes.  Great job!"}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing. We got the pulled pork and hush puppies. I couldn't have been more impressed with the sandwich and fries. It was amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service,  cocktails and food. Exactly what you're looking for when the idea is a classy comfortable night out. It's the bar you wish you were cool enough for be a regular at."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my husband's 40th anniversary at work.  The server was so nice.  Smiling, pleasant & attentive without being intrusive.  We wanted to taste everything and so we ordered the shrimp & grits and the fish tacos from the appetizer menu and split them.  Both dishes were crazy delicious!!!   Then we split a pork shoulder dinner & the kitchen split that for us.  So super scrumptious and both plates were beautifully prepared.   We were pretty full but decided we should have dessert because it was a special occasion so we ordered the PB&J dessert and yes.... peanut butter & jelly.  Peanut butter cookies with jelly in between with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  My husband loved it!!!  When we got the bill we realized they had 'bought' dessert for us to congratulate my husband on his anniversary!  Doesn't get much better than that!! We will definitely come back again!  Very pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"I was amazed at the level of service and quality of food I received at this restaurant. We had a short window of time before our movie started (theater next door) - and they made it a quick and excellent experience - so excellent - we returned after the movie for another course, drinks and desert!   The happy hour is awesome and it's has a beautiful atmosphere. This is a place to experience. They will see me again soon! Bravo!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Ten Handcrafted American Fare and Sprits since they opened! Every single time I am here the food is always outstanding! Service has always been stellar and the staff has always just been beyond friendly.  A few of my fav appetizers are the Shrimp and Grit Cake, Hush Puppies, and Fried Green Tomatoes, Entrée wise, the Chicken Ala King and Queen is wonderful as is their Pan Roasted Fresh Fish and if you still have room for desert, the PB&J Ala Mode is out of the world delicious!  Ten truly lives up to it's concept, it is truly approachable American cuisine at it's best!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews. I do though depend on yelp for insights when we travel. I should write more and maybe this place will motivate me to do so. I have worked in and owned food and beverage operations for over 40 years. It was a little hard for me to comprehend all the glowing reviews bestowed on this restaurant. But Jeff and his restaurant are the real deal the food is very well thought out and executed the staff is motivated and helpful. You would be making a big mistake by not stopping in to see Jeff and try any and all of the offerings. I would be there weekly at his bar enjoying his food if I lived here. Get in there! Now! Shrimp and grits...pot roast...it's all superb Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed! Everything from the cocktails to dessert was delicious. Staff was especially friendly and attentive. Would recommend the cucumber giblet cocktail and shrimp with gritcakes for starters. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. Was looking for something different as far as atmosphere and found it. Cool vibe and interior. Service was excellent, almost like you were being served at someone's house. I had the buttermilk fried chicken breast. I don't normally take pictures of my food, but I should have in this case. The portion was huge. My companion had the Burger with fries. Didn't taste the burger, but the fries were legit and seasoned perfectly. This will be on my list of favorites of Phoenix. BTW: they validate parking."}
{"text":"We started with fried green tomatoes.  Surprisingly tasty!  Our entrees included an apple salad, hamburger, and pan seared fish of the day -- tonight was snapper.  Everything was terrific. Everything was simply prepared and artfully presented. The vegetables (green beans and corn) were perfectly cooked (al dente).  Jeff the Chef stopped by our table -- nice guy!"}
{"text":"I surprised my husband with an anniversary dinner at Ten.  I chose it based on Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed!  For apps we ordered the hush puppies and the grits with shrimp. Though both were yummy, the grits were outstanding!  I've been craving them ever since we went a few days ago!  For dinner, we ordered their special for the night, which was a NY strip (exceptionally tender) on a potato hash with a fried egg on top.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  The food there is amazing and the service was wonderful!  The owner actually seated us!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"exact quote from my husband : \"this is one of the top ten meals I've ever had\". This man is NOT one to shower praise, ladies and gentlemen.   the amazing: -hush puppies!  -shrimp and grit cakes -pork shoulder  -pot roast -brownie dessert -Manhattan and Old Fash cocktails  -decor -service  -price  the less than amazing : -really can't think of anything.   just go!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. My friend and I went for happy hour and spent less than 40 dollars on food and drinks. The service was excellent. My friend had her baby with her and the server was very kid friendly. The chef/ owner came by the table to see how our food and time was going. That sealed the experience for me. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had the Cuban which was awesome, and my wife had the fried chicken which was perfectly cooked. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my bartender Joedee. She made the whole outstanding experience even better. I tried the entire happy hour food menu. My number one fav was the fish tacos followed by the hush puppies. And my drink was the cucumber gimlet, fresh squeezed lime juice and delectable. A must try"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. We will definitely come back!  The fish tacos were delicious and my husband loved his cordon blue sandwich! The balsamic dressing on the spinach and green apple salad was one of the best balsamic dressings we have had!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle (grew up in Phoenix) and stayed in the area of this restaurant for a couple of weeks.  We went to this restaurant one evening and found ourselves going back two more times!  Fantastic find, to say the least.  Staff was professional, friendly, approachable and made us feel more than welcome each time.  We ordered the following items over the three visits:  Chop Salad - Three types of lettuce, ham, tomato, Pepper Jack Cheese pieces, red onions with a dressing described as sweet, but was a perfect balance to the items in the salad.  B.E.T. \"you love it\" Wedge Salad - Lettuce wedge, bacon, hard boiled egg, tomato, blue cheese crumbles with a buttermilk dressing.  My husband and I split this and it was brought to us on separate plates - perfect!  Roasted Pork Shoulder (Ordered this TWICE) - Slow roasted pork, sweet BBQ glaze, perfectly prepared collard greens and some mashed potatoes.  Simply delicious with a great balance of sweet and savory with the middle ground of mashed potatoes.  Classic Chocolate Cake - Oh My Gosh! Milk chocolate buttercream a la mode vanilla bean.  Several layers and perfect for sharing.  Pare this with French Pressed Coffee - perfection!  House Merlot and House Chardonnay were great and only $5 per glass.  Also had a Cucumber Gimlet that was simply refreshing.  Wish we could take this restaurant home with us.  It is a restaurant that will not be a secret for long.  Great for lunch or dinner - great price point - simply excellent!"}
{"text":"From the perfectly fried green tomatoes to the Midway cocktail with the perfect amount of sweet and vodka to the mouth watering Cuban sandwich - Ten was an outstanding place to have dinner with friends! We loved it!!!"}
{"text":"This place... this place. Oh my god, let me tell you about this place.  First of all, let's get the obvious out of the way: yeah they're more expensive than chili's. You wanna eat something tastier than pig feed served in an ash tray? Then you're gonna pay a little more.  Seriously though, emphasis on the \"little more.\" The food and cocktails here are absolutely phenomenal and the price is a damned steal! Especially if you're here during happy hour.  Do yourself a favor, go here. Especially if you're sitting with anyone that can't make up their mind on where to go."}
{"text":"Overall good experience and we will be back   Ambiance/environment: creative and trendy. When you first walk in its a bit overwhelming and we were not greeted right away. To be honest, I was a bit nervous. First impressions are critical and being greeted by someone who is happy to see you as a customer, makes all the difference.  After a short delay, we were greeted and seated at our reserved table.   Service: we had a great server who was fast, friendly and efficient. I wish I caught his name as he deserves to be mentioned. It's very refreshing to have a server who is excited about his job.   Food/drink: I can't say enough about the food. It was just absolutely amazing. Some restaurants try to hard to prove something with their food, but at Ten's you get serious quality food that is just amazing.  we also enjoyed desserts and drinks and they were wonderful."}
{"text":"I am shocked at the 5 Stars.  Ten was decent, not 5 Stars.  I notice on Yelp a lot of neighborhood places can get high ratings with decent food if it is also their watering hole.  Service was great, Chef/Owner was present food was good.  Hush puppies appetizer worth getting for sure.  Cuban Sandwich was average same with the Pot Roast.  I will be back to review again.  Table next to us had the hamburger and it looked awesome. Cute intimate space."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Just drove in from LA to catch a dodgers spring training game and stopped for food and beer.  As excellent as the food was the service was out of this world.  They even searched the tv for a game that we wanted to watch!!  Highly highly recommended for anybody looking for a great place to eat and/or drink!!  Jodie and Jeff were exceptionally great!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing went with friends for a relaxing dinner out and was blown away elizabeth took excellent  care of us and the head chef stopped in multiple times he was hilarious we had the steaks and Cuban and there were better then any other restaurant I've been too !"}
{"text":"The food was great! The waiter really tried to please. At first when we walked in, he said to sit anywhere. It threw me off at first and I didn't feel welcome but then we went upstairs and settled in. It went up from there. 5 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant has easily become my favorite in Phoenix. Jeff is an incredibly involved & hospitable owner. He created all of the recipes you'll see on the menu from scratch, and I haven't tried a single thing there that is short of spectacular. So far, I have tried the hush puppies (the mixture of blue cheese, bacon, and chipotle dipping sauce with the sweetness of the hush puppies is out of this world), the \"speciality appetizer\" of pretzels with cheese fondue (not just any pretzels- fresh, flakey, buttery, with just the right amount of salt. also, not just any cheese fondue- pepperjack kiltlifter cheese that you feel like you could eat on absolutely anything and it would still taste good), the fish tacos (very light and fresh taste, love the mango chutney that is on top of them and that the portion of fish on the tacos is plentiful!), and the pulled pork bbq sandwich (also out of this world.) All in all, the food is top notch, I truly don't believe you can pick a bad thing on the menu. Also, the staff is incredibly friendly, and it truly feels like you are in an amazing semi-hidden gem filled with excellent eats, strong and delicious cocktails, and a whole lotta midwestern hospitality. We will be coming back VERY soon.  I should also note- the \"decompress\" aka happy hour deal is INCREDIBLE. $3 for any beer on the menu, 5 dollar cocktails, 5 dollar house wine (easily the best house wine I've ever gotten from a restaurant), and all appetizers are half off."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a good friend of ours as one of their favorites and its definitely going to be one of ours as well!  First off, if you can, sit at the bar and hope that Bretton is tending. Not only is he yummy to look at but he produces the best drinks. We had a cucumber gimlet that was to die for and then I had a drink called a clover I think - it was fresh raspberries muddled with Hendricks Gin, lime and I believe a touch if simple syrup and it was just divine. Not too sweet either!   The food is straight up comfort food - American and delicious! We had the hush puppies (the bacon and bleu cheese on top - a must!) with their spicy dipping sauce, the braised beef tacos - I could have eaten about 20, the crock pot chicken noodle - I know...weird to order at a bar but man was it delicious and last but not least, we had the fried green tomatoes. I am not a tomato fan and was also completely stuffed so I didn't try these but fiance said they were good but the other food we had was better.  The decor is awesome and it seems lie a great place for bigger parties as they had the top room rented out. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Carmela was great.  Food was great.  Had the chicken cordon blu sandwich.  Ate half and my son had the rest.  We both liked it.  Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and wanted to try it for some time. My boss sends us out  to lunch anywhere we want to go for our Birthday, and I like to make everyone go somewhere new. I chose Ten. My coworkers and I were not disappointed. The food, ambiance, and service were above all expectations. I would definitely go again.   Since it was my birthday, my coworker called ahead for reservations and to set up a birthday surprise, but was told they don't do them( not a bad thing in my book). After talking with (sad I can't remember her name, she was amazing, but it was a month ago) she was impressed with how far we drove to chose Ten, and brought out a piece of amazing chocolate cake with a candle for me. Which wasn't necessary for the 5 stars.   Must haves: Anything that suits your tastes, you will be happy with you choice. The shrimp and grit-cake stands out!"}
{"text":"Great service! Love the staff - food is great (expand the menu!) awesome atmosphere. You guys have it right ."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often. Its really not my thing. But I ate dinner at Ten tonight and simply cannot find my way around sharing my experience.  First thing's first, I'm not from the Phoenix area. I am from San Francisco and accordingly have what most people would consider to be somewhat high standards when it comes to restaurants. I also owned and operated a well regarded wine bar and restaurant in SF for several years not so long ago so I like to think I know my way around the inner-workings of what makes a restaurant great. I found Ten by doing a Yelp search. 5 stars rating with what seemed to be amazingly sincere reviews. Just a block from my hotel so really couldn't do any better.  When I walked in I was immediately greeted by a man in a chef's coat from behind the bar as well as a warm welcome from a server and the bartender. Throughout the course of my stay I learned that Chef Jeff is equally talented and comfortable behind the bar or table-side on the dining room floor as he is in the kitchen. Wonderful personality that really sets the vibe for the whole restaurant. Jeff is the real deal, salt of the earth foodie that knows the perfect wine to pair with each and every dish on the menu.  Clearly the vibe that was set by the staff was infectious. Conversation amongst perfect strangers at the bar was lively with everyone comparing notes about their dishes and their cocktail creations.  I'd go on and on about the pork shoulder entree but don't think I need to. It was fantastic. I also heard from the guest to my left that the steak and fries was out of this world and the guest to my right that the fish entree was one of the best he had ever had.  I cannot recommend Ten enough. I plan on going back next time I am back in Phoenix  and will be counting the days until my next trip."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!! The food and drinks are to die for! There was a group of 6 of us and we had: hush puppies, pot roast, buttermilk chicken, fresh fish of the day (salmon), and a burger. All were amazing! The cocktails are on point as well!"}
{"text":"I went in for the first time today for a lunch to go. The female bartender taking the order was sarcastic and very rude, making snide comments instead of politely answering a couple of questions I had. Her name on the receipt was AM B. I suggest she finds a job other than customer service."}
{"text":"Super happy we found this place.  Awesome vibe, awesome food, great prices.   My wife and I were on the lookout for a place just like this while on vacation in Phoenix.  Thanks Yelpers for the guidance, we loved it.  We had and awesome wedge salad and shared the pot roast meal, every bite was delicious.  We ended up trying the PBJ Dessert, my wife was nervous that she wouldn't like it but is was amazing.  Great service too.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic vibe and the best staff ever. We shared a wedge salad, the pork shoulder, pot roast and the PB&J dessert. All amazing and I highly recommend. I wish I remember the staffs names so I could list them personally, but all made for a great night."}
{"text":"Great food, in a great location. I had a few hours to kill in Phoenix and I was looking for a lunch spot on Yelp. This was the highest ranked place that was open at the time. Jeff, the owner, was there and we chatted about the hardships of the hospitality business. I ordered the cucumber gimlet which was a refreshing choice for the hot desert weather.   Overall, a solid place with great service and great food. First time in Phoenix and this was the best recommendation that Yelp and google spit out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour recently on a Saturday afternoon. The food was every bit as good as I had been lead to believe. There is a heavy southern influence to the menu. (I am from Spartanburg and Charleston SC). We had cocktails and the Fried Green Tomatoes, the amazing hushpuppies, and the chef's version of shrimp and grits all as appetizer portion which we shared. The Fried Green tomatoes are great. Light breading and fried to a slight brown. Not greasy at all and served with a spicy remoulade. The hushpuppies were perfect. Real southerners do NOT put sugar in their hushpuppies and these were perfect! Served hot in a paper cone and covered with blue cheese and bacon crumbles!! Really Good!  Shrimp and Grits and I have a deeply personal relationship. I cook shrimp and grits as did my mother father and grandparents and family before them. This version is in my opinion unique, having shrimp AND smoked sausage in a really good brown sauce served over a grits cake. Flavors were great. This was a first having sausage in Shrimp and grits and I loved it!  I would have given this place a 5 and would still like to but I have to comment upon the bar tender and wait person, a guy. We walked in around 4PM. There were a number of people there and no seats at the bar so the young man who greeted us sat us at a table. He was extremely over the top friendly, animated and in your face. Trying to be funny and not succeeding. We told him we would order our drinks and wait for a spot at the bar. Which we did. Just as our drinks arrived we moved to the bar. The waiter seemed less than pleased and the bartender pretty much ignored us. Seemed as if the waiter was displeased to loose a tip from our table. He spoke with us later and was even more in your face and abrupt. I expressed to the bartender that I was not amused. I still tipped correctly.  Management/or Chef should blind shop this place on the weekend. The comment from my GF was that the waiter and the bartender were high. She is in the hospitality business and I am a very experienced traveller and foodie. These two were not what they should have been.   Loved your food chef, and we will be back."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of Phoenix's hidden gems. From the food, to the drinks, to the cozy atmosphere, TEN will not disappoint. I've attended birthday parties here, while also having just a great HH. However, during one of my first visits for cocktails, I took a look at the food being served and I was incredibly impressed by its presentation. That was enough for me to order something and immediately be blown away. As a chef myself, it's tough for me to dine out, but ever since that meal, I haven't been able to stop raving about experience.   *It's important for me to add that this review is long overdue. It's been awhile since my last visit, and as long as the chef is still there, you'll be golden."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to try this place!! A girlfriend and I met here after work for dinner. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, the experience was spectacular. Atmosphere: comfortable, charming, and relaxed. Service: friendly, genuine, and really made you feel happy to be there. Our server knew the dishes and what the kitchen was capable of. She was fantastic in helping us decide our final meal choices. THE FOOD: I can barely type without stuttering because the food was southern divine!!! Unfortunately, my friend and I got the same thing so I can only tell you about this one dish but rest assured there are 10 other things I'm going back for to try next!! So, we had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and mashed potatoes. The coating on the chicken was crispy, so flavorful. The actual chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly!! This dish is Extraordinary!! (with a capital 'E'). I am not really a dessert person but we split the PB&J warm skillet. I will be having dreams about this dessert. PLEASE save room. This dessert is SPECIAL.   Two closing notes: fantastic drink menu (I had the La Pinta) and they validate parking. See you soon TEN!!"}
{"text":"I love TEN! Share the braised beef tacos in a lettuce cup, the wedge salad, the post roast, and the chocolate brownie dessert (not on the menu). My favorite indulgence meal."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food.  We had a big party and shared almost all of their main dishes which were incredible.  The staff is top notch and the chef came out to thank us at the end of the meal.  We had guests from out of town and they couldn't stop raving about the experience.  Their sea bass was one of the best I have ever had, their pork shoulder was one of the best, and the home made blue cheese hush puppies were fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Had out of town company in and had been wanting to try because of all the wonderful Yelp reviews...did not disappoint!  We all (8of us) really enjoyed our meals, food was delicious!  Will be going back!  A little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out with a friend of mine. Great food and cocktails. Make sure you get a reservation or you might not be able to get in. I was able to snag a seat at the bar without a reservation though! Again great food!"}
{"text":"NOTE: a little hard to find, this restaurant is in the back of a mixed use business complex building, near a movie theater. Valet parking was available, but a parking garage (also tough to find) was cheaper and just as easy to use. Your phone's map will get you to where the restaurant physically is, but you won't be able to see it from your car; just go ahead and park, and then turn on the walking directions from there.  My guests LOVED their entrees. They both had identical fish dishes, that were beautifully prepared. It doesn't indicate this on the menu (I don't think), but the fish comes out on an enormous bed of sauteed kale and green beans, both of which are perfectly prepared. Just lovely.  I had an appetizer + salad for my light dinner, and both were excessively salty. But based on the success of the other entrees at my table, I am willing to chalk this up to a heavy hand on that particular night.  The desserts were tremendous successes -- we didn't stop talking about them for the entire ride home.  Our server needed a bit more confidence or experience; we had difficulty hearing her, and after she explained the specials, we debriefed because none of us had heard what the second special even was.  However, the chef came out and greeted each table. He was exceptionally personable and invested in our enjoyment of the meal."}
{"text":"I have no idea what it took us so long to try this place but I am SO glad we did! My only regret is we only had time to grab a few drinks and an appetizer because we were catching a movie at the esplanade right after. We walked in at 5:56pm and happy hour ends at 6pm but our waitress was kind enough to let us order two drinks each at once so we could get the happy hour price! I had the ginger mojito and let me tell you this drink was fantastic! We had 4 drinks and 2 appetizers for $24!!! You cannot beat that for the quality of food and drinks in the biltmore area! The hush puppies were to die for! I would give this place infinite stars if I could and will definitely be back! If you haven't tried this place yet you NEED to."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems in Phoenix! A must try! Really can't go wrong with any dishes but I love the fish specials!"}
{"text":"Had the Cincinnati chili it was amazing. Huge in size and flavor. Price was great for how much you received. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING. The food, cocktails, and service were some of the best I've had in a long time. My husband and I ate here for our wedding anniversary. From the moment we sat down, the service (our waitress was Hannah) was absolutely amazing. Hannah checked on us numerous times and gave great food recommendations. We planned to try both happy hour appetizers and dinner entrees, but ended up sadly filling up on happy hour dishes before we tried an entree.   Happy hour runs from 2-6pm here Monday through Saturday. We tried the hush puppies ($3 HH, 4 per serving. Delicious fried doughy goodness with blue cheese and bacon, served with a tasty aioli). Next, we tried the fish tacos ($4.50 HH, 2 per serving with a little side salad, grilled fish with mango chutney and green apple slaw. My only complaint was that I could have used more Apple slaw on each taco). We also tried the beef brisket tacos (2 per serving, $4 HH, served with an egg. So so amazingly good). Our absolute favorite dish was the shrimp and grit cake. This had a pancake served with shrimp and andouille sausage in a sauce of spicy gumbo flavors. It was so good we order a second one!! I wanted to eat about 100 of these but sadly was full.  For dessert, our server recommended the Pb&J ice cream specialty. It was served in a skillet: warm peanut butter cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberry jelly, and flavorful caramelized peanuts. The dessert was fantastic and was complimentary for our anniversary. The chef even stopped by our table to check in and wished us a happy anniversary.   Cocktails were amazing. $5 for a handcrafted cocktail during HH. I tried the cucumber gimlet (so refreshing) and a clapper basil (grapefruit juice, absolut ruby, basil). Both so good and surprisingly strong.    Only drawback is the restaurant was tricky to find: located in a pedestrian walkway between office buildings. Parking is in a ramp next door and the restaurant will validate the parking.  I wish I lived next door to this place and could eat there every day. Honestly!"}
{"text":"I used Yelp to find a new happy hour spot the other day and was led to Ten. It is located in the Biltmore in what I believe was the old Fuego Tacos spot. I ordered an old fashion, which actually was not on the happy hour menu but that was my fault for not paying attention to the starred items. It was way too sweet for my taste, heavy on the sugar and not enough bitters. Next time I would try the cucumber gimlet.   I was eying the hush puppies on the table next to me and knew I had to give them a try, and they were delicious. They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and covered in bacon and blue cheese. The rouille sauce was creamy with a kick, just the perfect amount of spice. I could put that sauce on everything. I also go the shrimp and grit cakes but was a bit disappointed, the cake wasn't grits, it was a corn pancake, not what I expected but the sausage and shrimp were both really tasty as was the sauce it was served in.   This is a great spot to stop in for happy hour or maybe a quick bite before a movie. I can't wait to go back and try the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good food, and the happy hour prices (2 to 6) are over half off.  Fun server Joedee.  Food was seriously great, and very very inexpensive on happy hour tp boot."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and not only. Their salads are very, very good. Totally recommend it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Really great happy hour prices and tasty food options and the earliest happy hour I've seen make this place pretty awesome (a little hard to find, but worth it when you do)"}
{"text":"I like this place ! It's new and it gets some good reviews. Our group of 8 tried it out, we got seats upstairs. I didn't like it because it felt \"isolated\" from the bar and \"compromised\" the feeling of being THE ambiance. Also, Jodi was out of sight! She was the light of the party at the bar...and we got push upstairs ! At one point the waitress \"forgot\" about us, it was kinda understandable since it's quite a few steps up and down stair - that's like a lot of stairs master!  Food was very good! Chef stop by to say \"hello\". He's friendly and made some tasty dishes (#hushpuppies).  The cocktails: are good and strong and tasty, but I, personally, like Lux, Okra,  and Gladly better.  Overall, I would like to come back...with less then 8 peeps to have less distraction and enjoy more of the downstair fun-group."}
{"text":"Tonight my roommate and I went to 'Ten' for cocktails and dinner. We are both moving out of state and want to visit new places and our favorites before we depart. I have had Ten 'bookmarked' on Yelp to visit for months and finally got to try it out.  I can't believe the experience I had. We walked in to the small place and I fell in love! The tables were all full and they had a large private party upstairs so we grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender was wonderful! Not overwhelming like most, extremely nice and knowledgable. I got the cucumber gimlet and it was so refreshing. We couldn't decided on what to eat and he recommended the Pot Roast. WOW! It's not as good as my moms but it was pretty dang close which is saying A LOT!  From the second we walked in to the second we walked out we felt like we were the only guests in the place. I have worked in a restaurant for 7 years and know good hospitality like the back of my hand. Ten is above and beyond. I would say this was one of the top 5 places I have ever been.. Not only for the food but for the experience they gave us.  If I could rate Ten a 10 I would! Love it and I'll be back before I move in 2 weeks!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this little trendy spot for happy hour after a day at a training at the nearby Camby...  my friend had been here before and loved it... this place is cozy and requires a reservation during their busy time.. waitress was funny and helpful ..   We were very pleased with the food & drink menu.. generous pour on the alcohol (always nice!).. we split the braised beef & fish tacos.. the beef tacos were juicy and tender nice flavor.. the fish tacos were ok.. the shrimp and grits cake with that brown gravy was delicious (I could have licked that plate) .. the hush puppies were nicely fried served with a yummy dipping sauce..   For dessert we split the pb&j ala mode .. like a warm pb cookie with candied nuts & vanilla ice cream.. perfect end to this meal..   I will definitely be back.. I hear they have a great steak .. can't wait to try everything on the menu .."}
{"text":"My wife and I consider ourselves foodies. Some of our favorite restaurants include FnB, Beckett's Table, The Mission, Barrio Cafe and Hillstone. Well, we're adding a new restaurant to our list, TEN. The food was outstanding, the staff was incredibly personable and the Chef/Owner, Jeff Hostenske was the icing on our delicious Pot Roast. Add to that great wine and drinks and TEN gets a, well, perfect 10."}
{"text":"Great service! The menu is simple but great. Its not conveniently located but if you are in the area or there to see a movie its definitely worth the stop. I loved the fried green tomatoes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite atmosphere restaurants in the area. Waitress/waitresses are always amazing and friendly. Very insightful on the menu. Been here a few times and each time it has been a treat. Everything was tasty from the bread to the pickles."}
{"text":"Neat little restaurant in the esplanade. My boyfriend and I were anxious to try this place as we walked by it frequently and noticed the enticing menu.   Pros: -friendly staff -cute place -location  Cons: -crowded on the inside -expensive -food lacked flavor   Overall just so so"}
{"text":"Love everything about this little gem of a restaurant. Great food, great cocktails, great service , great ambiance. You can't go wrong here. A little hard to find, (in an office building??) but it's worth the small effort to find. I felt as the chef had cooked just for us! We ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, TO DIE FOR! Also has the Denver steak and fries. Really really tender and tasty. Fries were deliciously seasoned and came out hot! Which is a pet peeve of mine when you order fries, and they come out lukewarm. Not here! Pot roast seemed tender and delicious . I would highly recommend this place if you  are looking for well prepared food in a cozy, intimate setting.  Very nice people working the bar and serving. An A+ for this one, hands down!"}
{"text":"The hush puppies, side of fries, pot roast, and shrimp and grit cake.. All of it was phenomenal. Also highly recommend the cucumber gimlet, which was strong and refreshing.  This is an all-purpose location--dates, catchups, and groups will all do well here. Has a kind of tavern charm to it!"}
{"text":"Worthy of the hype. It was a fantastic meal on top on of that the price was great. Service was also amazing! Not that I want to give a way our little secret but they deserve the business!"}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air.  Quietly tucked away in a major center, this place needs a louder voice.  Food was beyond fresh and ingenious - perfectly spicy, perfectly salted - the appetizers were actually the star of the show (Fried Green Tomatoes, Shrimp Corn Cakes).  Everything with just the right flare.  The owner was beyond warm and gracious, and the service was attentive and pleasant, even though it was her last week until she moved!!!  The atmosphere a bit posh, a bit Diagon Alley - just perfect, with a loft and a bar.  Will be back - thank you so much for a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Good was so good! I had the fired chicken and it didn't disappoint. My wife had the stuffed chicken which was to die for. Totally coming back here again!"}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed our dinner last night. The service was excellent, the drinks were perfect, and our meals were delicious. From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed, and were treated so warmly by all of the employees. We loved our meals, pot roast and fried chicken, and can't wait to go back and try more of the menu. Overall a great evening!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, my waitress was a delight.  Chef excellent and very friendly. Halibut tacos amazing, great Cuban and great food."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and food. The Pot Roast is incredible. Fresh ingredients and excellently prepared. If your in the area this is a must stop. The reviews don't lie!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night thing before going down town to see a comedy show and had a wonderful time. It has fairly convenient parking and is in a good location. It's not a massive place but the inside is really nice, very well decorated.   We had the braised beef tacos as an appetizer and it was great once we figured out how to deal with the fried egg on top. I had steak and fries and everything was cooked perfectly and was delicious. My date had salmon and she said it was also really good.   The server was super helpful, made reccomendations and answered all questions we had. Overall it was a great experience and highly reccomended for a more casual date night."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was very attentive.   Food highlights: hush puppies, pot roast and pb&j a la mode. YUM!!! Plus $5 glasses of house wine!   we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to pregame before the movie. Shrimp and grit cake is my go-to appetizer. Hush puppies are also delicious; the best I've had in a while, amazing texture and corn flavor. The cocktails are good too!"}
{"text":"In 2017, my husband and son discovered Ten. It was so memorable that when we came to Phoenix this year my son specifically asked to come back.   They did NOT disappoint!  Service was friendly and very helpful.  The hush puppies were out of this world, as was the shrimp and gritcake.  We didn't stop there! And, the cocktails were delicious, too!   The fried chicken and the pot roast could not have been better. The only slight knock was the Cuban sandwich, which could've had more flavor.  Dessert was a KIt Kat bar cheesecake. Huge piece, so 3 forks to close out an exceptional meal.  This gem of a place is worth visiting. You won't know it's there without a search. Not visible from the street and hidden in an alley, near the Camby Hotel."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations - bartender and drink was on point, food not so much.  The bartender introduced me to a new bourbon which was really good and his service was great.  I tried the chicken cordon bleu sandwich - chick was moist, but lacked breading of any texture/seasoning.  The sandwich was pretty messy, slathered with mayo, and disappointing.  Would come back for drinks, but probably pass on the food or try something completely different than a sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by TEN for lunch on our way from Sedona to to Tucson, visiting from Portland, ME. Delicious food, cool laid back vibe, and excellent service by Joedee."}
{"text":"the best. the owner and staff are wonderful the food is amazing.  this is not a place for kids at all, this is for romance, business and good food by the baltimore."}
{"text":"Oh where to even begin. The atmosphere is incredible. Think Perisian meets Uptown meets your designers living room. The food was incredible, shrimp and grits, hush puppies all served in a fancy yet completely non arrogant way. And our lovely Server Jodie made our experience. Funny, Sweet and an absolute Darling. The only problem with this place is that they fed us so well I didn't get a chance to sample everything. For another amazing, family owned, independent option in the Valley make sure you give this place a try."}
{"text":"We found Ten on Yelp so decided to try it because it's so close to home. We were there on a Wednesday and I wanted to write a review the minute we left but didn't have time.  First off we were able to get seated immediately. Our waiter was super friendly, very personable and attentive. We started with the hush puppies and shrimp and grit cake appys. Both were delicious. 6 of us each ordered either the pot roast, pork shoulder or salmon special. Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest I love salmon, so am very picky about it being wild caught, fresh and perfectly cooked. I can't stand over cooked salmon. So after we drilled out server about all those points and he assured us that the salmon was fresh, 2 of us decided to try it. It was the BEST salmon I have ever had!!!!! It was cooked to perfection with a bacon vinaigrette topping. Sounds unusual but it was SO DELICIOUS! The chef was even willing to share his (general) recipe with us! It's too bad that the salmon is not on the regular menu, but  I'm sure it's because it can only be offered when they can get it fresh. This is now my favorite restaurant. Keep doing what you're doing! There's a reason why you've got hundreds of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fish and beef tacos were amazing. The bartender is super nice! We went there in the afternoon . Nice music and ambiance. Small and cozy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and we absolutely LOVED everything about it! Great drinks, the shrimp and grit cake for apps was delicious, and our entrees (fried chicken and pork loin) were just amazing. Huge portions, comfort food, everything made from scratch, friendly staff...I can't recommend TEN highly enough."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat. Grey Goose Martini is on point, pot roast is just like Mom's, and the Kit Kat cheesecake is to die for! Loved our waitress she has such a fun personality and her service was great. The Manager was just the same loved his personality and great service."}
{"text":"First off, the waitress Carmella is the absolute best! She gave awesome recommendation for food and drink that were spot on amazing. I ordered the sea bass special and got it blackened...wow. So much flavor in this dish. We also got the PB&J a la mode dessert. Inventive, classic, delicious. I'll definitely be coming back here! Great food, generous portions, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Had the burger breakfast style with egg and bacon and a wedge salad with salmon! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow-went here for my husband (Darin) birthday. Amazing icy martinis from Brett, fantastic service and friendliness from Joanna and great check-in and oversight from Jeff. A creative menu:  recommend the hush puppies, fried green tomatoes and brownie with homemade ice cream.  Noticeable teamwork and an intimate atmosphere and comforting menu.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The greatest thing about TEN is how unique I feel it is.  Yes they have burgers and fries and other ubiquitous menu items but I feel they put forth the effort to make them special to their restaurant instead of pumping them out in mass with the doctrine that all burgers et cetera are created equal.    The staff here have a good energy to them, not like a wired and bouncing around energy but more like they feel enthused about running their restaurant like it's their calling.  Their pride shows in their air of absolute confidence.  Don't get me wrong this place is not perfect, the menu is limited, the healthy options are limited and a few other things here and there.  However, I feel like they knew what they excelled at and they stuck to it.  I appreciate this because I'm rather tired of going to restaurants and being served food that the establishments knew was inferior, I doubt that would happen here.  Phoenix needs more restaurants like TEN, the simple fact is this metro lacks character and genuineness and TEN brings it some more."}
{"text":"The service was amazing here. Even though they didn't have a kids' menu, the chef made delicious mac n cheese and chicken tenders for our children. The food was also solid. The pork was very good. Ambience was also casual but nice."}
{"text":"They do it right here period. Great bourbon, creative cocktails (the American mule-incredible) plus amazing food appetizers entrees and atmosphere. Jeff and his crew are great!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit. I can't say enough good things about the service, food and ambiance. I had the halibut, which was cooked to perfection and served on a bed of corn and other delicious stuff. The peanut butter dessert was amazing. Overall, this is a wonderful dining experience. I recommend highly, with no hesitation. Btw try the cucumber gimlet. Perfect cocktail."}
{"text":"The first impression we had of this four years old restaurant was je ne sais pas grunge. Just a sense of senseless aging and need of refurbishment. The food included outstanding fried green tomatoes, decent hushpuppies, alright if under-dressed and under-cheesed wedge salad, and truly mediocre chicken soup. The soup, which our waitress decided was to be shared was actually inconsistent between the two cups, one with no seasonings and the other with too much black pepper and naught else. So, overall underwhelming."}
{"text":"Being out of town, this was an excellent find! We immediately were greeted by Jeff, the chef and owner of the restaurant. Our family felt instantly like we belonged, and we quickly started conversations with numerous staff members. Our waiter Breton was excellent, always making sure everything was alright at our table. The food came out quickly and was delicious (I would highly recommend the hush puppies!). You could tell the staff truly cared about the well being of their customers. The atmosphere and lighting had a cool tavern feel, which built on the entire experience. Our family will definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but awake food.  I have only been here twice. Both times with large parties of 20 + people.  Great friendly service and fresh food."}
{"text":"This was an exceptional find for happy hour after a day of travel!  Very pleasant atmosphere, and the owner greeted us and offered great suggestions for drinks, including some interesting true craft beers.  We ordered three appetizers, and probably only needed two to fill us up...   The fried green tomatoes were something we had to try, and not knowing what to expect, they were great - well battered without overpowering the firm green tomato slices, on top of a nice pair of sauces and some baby arugula for support.   The braised beef tacos came with a perfectly fried egg between them, and at the server's suggestion we broke the yoke open while splitting the egg on each taco, then sopping up the rest while eating the tacos... Yum!   The fish tacos were the best and a great finish.  Nicely cooked fish, baby arugula, everything well proportioned and way tasty.  Even with flour tortillas (why do they do this in Phoenix, corn is so so much better?)  they were delicious.  The mango chutney was amazing and made it almost dessert-like.   Bonus, all of the appetizers were half price, so this was a fantastic treat without killing our travel budget!"}
{"text":"Very cool place to hang out, have a beer or 2 before watching a movie at the AMC upstairs. First time I had the Prescott Achocolypse. I love dark, chocolate, porters. They also have this pb&j dessert. Wow! Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome drinks, and awesome service.  So happy we found this place!  On 10/23 we came to celebrate a friend's birthday and were not disappointed, each of us tried something different and were beyond satisfied.  :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant does not disappoint.  Great food and service.  This time I tried the Cincinnati chili.  It was amazing and being from Ohio I can say that it tastes authentic.  My friend had fish tacos that were amazing.  Looking forward to returning for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"While searching for a Ninja/T-Rex restaurant I stumbled upon this gem. It more than satisfied my carnivore needs despite letting me kick chairs in half. It's not always about me. Now on to the food. The first time we were there we had the Cuban sandwich and the pulled pork Sammy. Holy Velociraptor Fellas! Took me from 6 to Midnight if ya know what I mean. I've had a lot of pulled pork sandwiches across the south and that was either the best or the second best I've ever had. Thank you for the cheese on it! The chef is a super friendly, albeit Cowboys fan, who grew up outside of Cincinnati and spent his later life in the south. The food speaks this. I've never seen anyone stupid enough to put chili on spaghetti before except Cinci peeps and ASU students who are 3 bongs in, but I tried his chili, and SQUEEZE MY PINKY TOE it was amazing! I'm running out of my big words here, but just like Courtney Love, give this place a shot! Oh, and if you go during the day, watch for the funniest bartender ever. Miss Jodi! She goes by Tigerhawk and she'll make you laugh your ass off like an old Paula Abdul video."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and stumbled upon Ten after doing a quick Yelp search. I was not disappointed. The bartender and waitress were extremely hospitable and the food was delicious and fresh in its own right. I tried the hush puppies that others had raved about and fell in love. Since I wasn't terribly hungry, I selected the fish tacos as my main, and the sweet and tangy combination of the mango chutney and green apple slaw with lightly fried fish was everything I needed.   The most enjoyable was probably the company. The playful banter between the bartender and waitress that included their guests made the spot feel familiar and not at all awkward for a person dining by themselves. If I weren't driving myself around town these two days, I would have certainly gotten myself a drink or two.   Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"A solid five star rating. TEN does it right!!! From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere grabs a hold of you.  This was our first visit to TEN and we came during happy hour, so we had to sample it all.  We ordered the Shrimp and Gritcake, Fish Tacos, Braised Beef Tacos, and Fried Green Tomatoes.  All the dishes we ordered were off Happy Hour menu and were really cheap!! For what you get, this place is a must visit at Happy Hour!!!  We sampled 4 items and had 2 of their signature cocktails and our bill was less than $30. I can't stress this enough--this is a MUST visit for happy hour. Everything was so good! We also had friendly and prompt service. Our food was out very quickly, the drinks were strong but well mixed, and my wife also enjoyed the tunes they were playing. We will definitely be back, but I will try hard to come back during happy hour because the value was tremendous!"}
{"text":"Aptly named. Jeff the host owner, remembered us from previous visits, went out of his way to accommodate us. It is his nature. The entire operation reflects his professionalism. The wait staff is superlative. The bar serves the best mojito ever. We have lived in the Southeast on several occasions and we feel he has reached the pinnacle on dishes like hush puppies, fried green tomatoes, shrimp & grits, pulled pork etc. If they have it, the chicken soup is also top drawer. Our friends walked out with us raving about the entire experience."}
{"text":"Amanda served us and it was the bomb. She had a great personality and made it fun for us. We had the hush puppies, beef tacos, wedge salad all was amazing. We had a great time and the service was amazing. Cute little place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars. The service was phenomenal. Everything we tried was delicious. The decor and music were equally fabulous."}
{"text":"BBQ pulled pork with granny apple slaw.  My day could not get any better after that!  Jodi took great care of me sitting at the bar and it felt like we were all friends visiting on a stool.  Chef Jeff takes great pride in his creation and it shows in everything he does.  Followed up with a group meeting upstairs with an appetizer sampler of hush puppies, tacos, fried green tomatoes and more great service!  Top notch!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.....the best in a long time!!!! we will be going here often....you really can't get service like this anywhere anymore!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Yelp when I was visiting Phoenix. Wow just wow!!! The Chef/Owner was so nice, he went by every table to greet people. The service was impeccable. Great suggestions when asked and so friendly. I had the wedge salad (a must try) with the chicken it was mouthwatering! My husband had the Pork Shoulder which melted in the mouth, and the mashed potatoes were amazing. The only thing is I wish they had more dessert options. We did try the PB&J it was really good, but a little too sweet for me. Bottom line this place is a must go to whenever in Phoenix. Great job!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a new restaurant close to where I lived and I stumbled upon this place. While I thought the place was very inviting with a very friendly staff, my meal was awesome! ! I had the pot roast and my wife had fish which she said was very good.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes or maybe my new favorite pit roast."}
{"text":"Checked out TEN for a drink and app prior to dinner and it made us want to stay and eat!  The atmosphere is bustly and energetic with a Midwest welcome feel.  The decor somewhat reminded me of a Chicago eatery.  The owner is not above being your seater, server, or drink pourer and ensures you and your guests are more than satisfied.  The shrimp and grits were delish especially with the surprise sausages throughout. The cucumber gimlit was smooth and refreshing and the midway fulfilled it's promise of perky tart and sweet.  Will definitely return to this neighborhood spot that feels it more belongs in a refurbished trend area than the Esplanade."}
{"text":"Ten is located on the ground floor at The Esplanade.  \"Simple and chocked full of charisma\" is how I feel about the what I call \"soft industrial\" bar/dining areas, as well as the menu.  From the menu, \"TEN is not only the heart of Chef & Owner Jeff Hostenske's name, but also his passion. Approachable American cuisine covering every moment of his life, starting with the Midwest classics from his childhood, to the culinary upbringing in the low country of Charleston, SC, solidified with the inspiration from his nomadic culinary career in the United States.    I was already a huge fan of an appetizer called \"Shrimp and Gritcakes\" and that was before I read that it included andouille sausage. Then taste it ... and well, YUM.  Also enjoyable were the braised beef tacos (w/arugula, fried egg and bacon) as well as the fish tacos with mango chutney.  I tend not to care for mango chutney, but this wasn't too tart or sweet (nor mushy; can't tolerate mushy.) Time permitting, they are flexible about menu substitutions. How nice!   As for beverages, there's a house cab, merlot and chardonnay priced at $5.00 all day, as well as a nice selection by the bottle or glass. There's bottled and canned beer available as well as a full bar. I'd originally thought that the \"hand-crafted\" in the restaurant's name extended to in-house spirits (infusions and what-not) but they do not produce in-house. Coffee is French-press only.   I'm saving the bacon & bleu cheese hush puppies as well as the fried green tomatoes for the next visit. Heck, I think everything on the menu sounds delicious.   I can definitely recommend lunch and happy hour, but won't surrender the fifth star until we have a chance to try dinner. Looking forward too, to dining in the upstairs space.   Call ahead for reservations. Seating is limited and I'm sure it's only going to get busier."}
{"text":"Stellar service , world class ambiance and carefully crafted cocktails fit for royalty but priced approachable for paupers and thirty thousand dollar millionaires like myself who appreciate the finer things--thoughtfulness and attention to detail.    I came across this place a few months ago on yelp nation and last night whilst entertaining a ladyfriend unsheathed my sword to hack free from the confines of mercbar's Saturday night tomfoolery--fortune does in fact favor the bold as we were greeted immediately by the owner himself whom openly weighed the benefits of different tables available for seating.    We decided on the second floor where we were cheerfully greeted with ice waters and a consultative approach to our dining intentions and preferences of the libation variety.    Being somewhat of a fattard and a peanut butter prostitute I immediately was drawn to the PB and J and very happy that I ordered it.  Warm, delicious and beautifully presented peanut butter cookie dough baked to perfection with candied peanuts and jelly layers topped with PB ice creamery goodness.  A low calorie option , this is not.  Life is short and memory of this masterpiece will enjoy longevity.    Seeing we were open for suggestions our server (Jaimie ? Jake? Maybe) asked a few questions and then returned with a midway and a cucumber gimlet--which was superb while the midway was a little sweet but a good fit for aforementioned lady-friend.   Our server had a hobbit likeability and was attentive and funny without being annoying.  Had a nice sense of self mockery and mirrored our moods perfectly.  I hope he has a meteoric rise per Frodo Baggins.   We closed the place down but never felt the slightest bit rushed.    This place is in fact a perfect ten! Well done, well played and we'll be back."}
{"text":"After trying Ten as part of a fabulous Elite event, I just had to come back...again....and again. The happy hour here cannot be missed. Their drinks are delicious and so affordable during happy hour (5$.... amazing!). The food is also top notch. I've tried just about everything on the happy hour menu with the best items being both tacos (fish are fresh and delicious, the braised beef is even better... so flavorful and complex with a runny egg on top.. .yummmm) and the hush puppies (bacoooon)!! The shrimp and gritcakes are also fabulous, but I don't love shrimp. The fried green tomatoes are good, but probably my least favorite of the apps. Anyway, you need to try this place.... a consistent, delicious, affordable place with friendly service and a comfortable atmosphere. What more can a gal ask for?"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal and great drinks at 10. Our waitress Carmella was a total stitch we loved her joking around with us. We had great customer service. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place has great food. We loved the fish and the hush puppies. I also liked the beers on tap."}
{"text":"I had the hushpuppies, cheeseburger with egg on top, and peanut butter and jelly a la mode dessert. All were delicious. Good ambiance. Great prices! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were staying close by at the Ritz, so at first this was about convenience. Yelp steered us to Ten for lunch on our first day. Great experience on every level - atmosphere, service, quality of food, creativity of menu - you name it. We went back for dinner on our last night and it was every bit as good as that first experience. There are lots of options in this area but none are better than Ten."}
{"text":"Not the best service. I arrived for happy hour at 5:20 PM and there were four open tables yet they weren't going to seat us because they had reservations starting IN AN HOUR. I was told I had an hour to eat. When I told them that was unacceptable they finally sat us, without a time limit, but the joke was still on me... My boyfriend and I both got sick that night from eating the items on their happy hour menu.   This was my second time there and I do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and a must stop.before any movie... The hush puppies at happy hour half price rock!!!  They offer apricot hefeweizen which is a rare find .. it is here and amazing.  Amanada knows what your wanting before you know  .. a great happy hour and nightcap spot"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Stopped by for a bite before the movie. Was beyond impressed.! Started with a cucumber Martini....... Yummy.  Since we were here at Decompression time most drinks and all apps were half price! The shrimp with grit corn cakes were as good as in Charleston,  S.C.  The fried green tomatoes were perfectly cooked and firm nice slices . The last thing and my favorite was the Blue Cheese hush puppies!! To die for!!! Jodi is fantastic behind the bar!!!! A perfect place before or after a movie or ANYTIME!!!"}
{"text":"Whoever took my phone order for pickup was rude and distracted while taking my order.  Then after I placed my order there was an awkward silence.  I thought the lady taking the order was maybe writing something down so I was just waiting for her to ask me if there was anything else I wanted or to tell me how long it would take for my order to be ready or to say goodbye.  Instead, she just hung up on me.  No thank you, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area where I can get lunch.  I am giving more than 1-star because I've eaten lunch and appetizers for happy hour here before and the food is good, but nothing really stellar sticks out in my mind.  I like the inside industrial-ish decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Interesting little restaurant in the Esplanade. Chef is very personable with old Family Recipes. Menu is a little limited but tasty. Only had some appetizers and a drink."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!  The personal touch that the owner has on everything from the decor to the service sets this place apart!  The food was absolutely wonderful!!!  I will definitely come back and I recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Impressed!  We went to a very early happy hour (which is basically a late lunch for hubby and I - around 2:30) and it was terrific. Lunch crowd was gone and it was quiet.  I'm sure its packed for lunch.  Fish tacos were fabulous along with a very tasty baby spinach salad with a sweet light  dressing.  Meat tacos were also delicious and came with bacon and a  fried egg.  Little unexpected extra's go a long way.  Even tried fried Grits cake  and shrimp and although a bit spicy for me was fantastic and really loved by my husband.  Drinks were wonderful (delicious Ginger Mojito and an American mule (bourbon ginger and lime).   Will definitely come back to try dinner.  Great service, clean place. Friendly.  Park first floor in multi-level structure for theaters in Esplanade (they validate)."}
{"text":"My husband and I were impressed with this restaurant. We were able to chat with Chef Jeff. We loved his enthusiasm and pure joy for what he does. The drinks were wonderfully crafted. We had the old fashioned and the cucumber gimlet--both were great! As far as the food goes, we loved everything we had. We love the Chef's no nonsense approach to food and flavors. We absolutely love the shrimp and grit cake, the chop salad, and the Cuban sandwich. This is a must try restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving you three stars for a couple reasons. 1- I will see start off and say this is a cute restaurant and nicely decorated in the Biltmore area. 2-  the menu item looked bare. I have dietary restrictions and so dining here was rough on what to eat. 3- the waiter didn't come around very often. Granted I was on a first date, but usually the waiter comes around to check on us. The waiter did not . I had to flag him down for the check. (Cringe). 4- one of your salad entries comes with bacon and I can't have bacon, so I asked to sub it for chicken. They said no, it would cost more. 5- I parked in the garage and got my ticket validated at your restaurant with the assumption that I would not have to pay for the 3 hours I was at your restaurant. Well I had to pay 2 dollars with the validation and when I called for assistance a lady came up with an attitude and said because I waited too long to pay the two dollars I have to pay the full price - 8 dollars. Overall, it was not my favorite experience. Unless I have to, I won't be back. Sorry"}
{"text":"An intimate two-story dining room run by 1 bartender and 1 server - maybe in a bit over their heads, but very friendly and great food.   Started with hush puppies, I've never been a fan of that particular snack, but my wife loves them, and I've you have to have them, go here. I don't know what situation you'd be in that you'd HAVE to have hush puppies, but if that's your situation, I envy you, especially if you live here, you're lucky, enjoy it while it lasts.  I ordered the special - Alfredo pasta with spinach and tomatoes - fresh and unique, full of flavor. Across the table, steak salad, steak tender and well cooked, ingredients shining.   We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Returned on Saturday and we were pleasantly surprised. We met the owner and chef, Jeff and he truly cares about you having a great experience through great food, great service at a great price point. We started with the wedge salad with buttermilk dressing and we were so glad our server suggested that we share because just having half was huge! The dressing was delicious with lots of bacon bits and hard boiled egg. We also shared the hush puppies and this time they looked just like I was expecting lots of blue cheese and bacon bits and the puppies were warm and crisp with a moist savory center. I choose the fish which was sea bass on top of vegetables and it was incredible. The green beans were cooked perfectly, still having that nice crunch, the tomatoes were caramelized bringing out their wonderful flavor and the fish was moist and flaky. The slightly creamy sauce had a sweetness to it that made you want to drink it up. My husband had the steak which was very tender and cooked to a perfect medium rare, instead of the fries he was able to substitute sauteed spinach which perfectly seasoned. For dessert we had the PB&J Ala mode and all I can say is it was phenomenal! Crunchy peanuts with moist peanut butter bar/cake that had jelly either on the bottom or center (it was hard to tell) but put it all together with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was heaven. They have a great wine list, a full bar with great specialty cocktails. Great service, great food and great prices. We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Been all over the world and then some. This restaurant knocks it out if the park. It's all about the people and the food, and 10 has it both. Best pot roast I've ever had. Have never had a bad meal, only great meals. Jeff and Brian move to Mi. and open one up, please. You guys are truly the best!!! Amanda, Brandon, Evan, Carmella thank you so much. For your amazing hospitality. I love all you guy's!!!!!........Mac"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Small intimate setting. Nice date spot."}
{"text":"I read the 5 star reviews, which really means nothing as a rule--5 stars are usually fakes or idiots who can't see anything wrong. Look at all the idiots who gave Blinks in Cave Creek 5 stars!!! MORONS!! But I tried  this place  anyway.  First thing you notice is the bar is way way too small, only sits 8.  They could expand to 12 but...oh well.  The menu is limited and prices high, but best time is happy hour when prices are lower.  Had the hush puppy and soft taco--nothing outstanding but worth the $3 & $4.50.  Great beer prices at $3 for top grade stuff.  Saw bartender handle cut lemon without washing hands--a no no, but I guess the booze killed the germs.  A hard place to find but worth a look.  I will be going back to try other menu items but will not be ordering a drink with lemon!  LOL."}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot yesterday 8/28/17 ...excellent friendly service, nice atmosphere and great food & beer.  Had the Fried Green tomatoes & Shrimp and grits along with several nice beers including a couple Beauregard Blueberry Sours...   Highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Can't think of a better lunch spot in Phoenix.  I've had everything on the menu and often get whatever special they have for the day.    The burger is a miracle.  The cordon blue is fantastic.    Honestly I can't think of anything in the menu that isn't a knockout - it's all just perfectly done.  Breads for sandwiches are better than Hillstone or OSHO etc.    Jody the bartender is hands down the best bartender/server in town.  Just an absolute delight.  Fantastic memory - has my drink on the bar before I'm done putting my jacket on the chair.  A true sweetheart.  Makes you feel like Norm from Cheers every time you walk in.   This is my NUMBER ONE SPOT for lunch around the Biltmore business district.    Chef is righteous and his menu is as friendly as it gets.   I can't say enough good about the place.    Oh FANTASTIC prices - best bang for your buck period!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this because of the good reviews and was not disappointed. The pot roast and mash potatoes were delicious, I had a bowl of the chicken soup and the hamburger..the whole thing was delightful. Our waitress, and the owner were so pleasant, even thou we're only here for a couple if days, we're tempted to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great find and great date night option! As a picky eater, it's sometimes hard for me to find menus I like so I use Yelp to search for restaurants and check menus. We had high expectations based on the reviews and were not disappointed. We felt welcomed from start to finish. Kalen was just a delight taking great care of us and was so friendly and helpful! The pot roast was delicious as was the chocolate cake. :) My hubby had the pulled pork sandwich and asked for no coleslaw. The owner, Jeff, (also the chef) came out to apologize and offered to make it right since it came served with coleslaw on top by mistake. For my hubby, it was no big deal, he just pushed it off and thoroughly enjoyed his meal so no need to redo it. But, what struck me was the personal touch and customer service that seems to be sorely lacking at many other restaurants. That the owner came out to personally make things right, that he pitched in wherever was needed and that he has such integrity and hired a cohesive team; it's easy to see why this restaurant is excelling!"}
{"text":"Kat was an amazing waitress and all the food we ordered was exceptional. The Cuban and bbq pork were delicious and make sure you save room for the PB&J dessert! If I lived in the area this would be my new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Pretty good prices for lunch, great portion sizes, and delicious food! It can get a bit busy for lunch, but service is usually speedy!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be the most talked about restaurant in the biltmore area. Maybe even all of Phoenix. What a cool place. The food is amazing. We've been several times and it's consistently fantastic. The only thing missing is a patio but if it had one I don't think I'd ever go home."}
{"text":"After seeing the other reviews and their overall score of a five, I was very excited to try this place. Let me tell you - it did not disappoint.   We went during HH on a Sat and as soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a friendly \"hello.\" It did not take long before our server came over and offered menus plus an explanation of their HH specials.    I tried the chicken noodle soup for starters and it was absolutely yummy. It had great seasoning and was filled with egg noodles and shredded chicken breast. Plus, our server included yummy oyster crackers. Definitely one of the hardiest chicken noodle soups I have had at a restaurant.   For our main courses we had the pulled pork sammie and a cheeseburger. The pork was seasoned to perfection, not too salty and not too sweet. The burger was cooked just the way I like it and was bursting with flavor topped with juicy tomato slices, crispy bacon, and perfectly pickled pickles. My number one ordered the salad as a side and I ordered the French fries (we shared both).   During our lunch, the Chef (pretty sure it was Jeff), came by to check on us. He was pleased with both our responses and empty plates. Also, our server was outstanding- he was very informative and attentive.   We are both looking forward to having a second meal at Ten. Until next time...."}
{"text":"I'm only holding off giving a 5 star review until I return to have other things on the menu. When thinking of ways to describe my experience... A Dream... Delicious... Memorable... I'm so into this place.  First of all, it is absolutely adorable, buuut, Not pretentious, yet sumptuous and splendid.  I walk in and order right away.  I saw the pics of the Shrimp and Grit Cake and I was anxious to try that.  I was also interested in the Cucumber Gimlet...  both items were 5 star experiences for me.  When I got the shrimp and grit cake, I thought, \"I think I need a spoon for all this gravy.\"  but I soon discovered, as you cut away from the grit cake, it actually soaks up all of that gravy --- NO spoon needed.  This may be one of the best tasting and the most aesthetically pleasing Shrimp and Grits I've ever had.  It was perfect.  From the grit cake gradually soaking up the gravy to the nicely spiced and suitable seasoning to the appropriately cooked shrimp... Every. Thing. About. This. Dish. Is. Perfect.  Then the cucumber gimlet... simply perfection in a glass.  I'm enjoying the old and new EXCELLENT gastro pubs around Phoenix.  Ten is proving to be a 10, indeed.  I plan to return soon.  I know my 4 Star will go to a 5 star.  Can't wait."}

{"text":"came here after seeing many great yelpers rave about it but sorry to dissent  food app was fried green tomatoes-bland, not great at all  pot roast-good, meat was tender  denver steak- awful, tasted like shoe leather  with chunks of fat  service slow, we had 30 for an appetizer the chef /owner made rounds to make sure every thing was ok which always makes me suspect, either that or this is a very new restaurant  parking they DO VALIDATE, just ask them  overall meh"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its overwhelmingly positive reviews. Very solid service, excellent food, and reasonably priced. I would recommend the hush puppies and shrimp and grits appetizers. The sea bass was also fantastic, and among the least expensive I have seen. The chef definitely knows what he is doing.   The only very minor complaint I have is that, while their bottle selection is solid, they don't have any beers on tap."}
