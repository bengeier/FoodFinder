{"text":"I enjoyed my vegetable curry, and I noticed that the Indian grandmas at the other table were happily stuffing their faces.  Friendly staff.

You can tell they are proud of the food they offer.  Prices are very reasonable, and the menu offers a lot from which to select.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Average food. They changed their name but service was poor. I think the owner lady kept shouting at the servers.. Really big place but very few people. Servers were not good- they did not know what to do - seemed lost!"}
{"text":"Great place. 
I was skeptical as a meat eater -- this place is a vegetarian only affair. 

I should have known that if anyone could do Vegetarian, it was a well trained Indian place. That's what this tasted like.

Vegetable Samosas were huge and delicious, served with two lighter sauces that accentuated without drowning the samsoas.

I completely forget the name but it was a potato / cauliflower red curry. So good.  One complaint here: that there weren't as many potatoes/cauliflowers as one would like given that there wasn't any meat.

Coconut / Vegetable Pancake - friends had, I couldn't try -- too full. I can say that it looked like a very good value, at the price

I also tried a puff bread / pastry that was quite good. unfortunately i don't remember many menu items since they seem to lack a business presence on the net. Let's hope that this Yelp will get some people to actually believe that it is possible to eat a meal w/o meat and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Food is inexpensive and may be thats y the quality is also OK OK.. Hence Rating is also OK OK. :)...
Ps: Never rely on Sambar here, its just bland hot water."}
{"text":"I am new to Cleveland & tried Udipi today. It was Sun afternoon & the atmosphere is really relaxed. I believe the food was good, and the service is decent. When requested, the staff is very prompt to deliver. I believe the service can be a little better, a little more \"aggressive\" in a good way. 

The prices are decent, especially for the different options available on the Buffet. Great place for an all vegeterian menu."}
{"text":"Good food, but not happy with the service.
We were 3 couples, went there together and the server refused to split the bill. We told him up front that we are going to pay separate but he asked us to take it to manager at time of payment. Manager \"advised\" us that you divide the bill by 3. well, we just wanted to pay for what we ordered :("}
{"text":"This is not authentic south Indian food. Just  because this is the only south Indian restaurant in Cleveland area does not make it okay for them to serve bad food. Coconut chutney is not mixing dry coconut powder with water. Bad  attitude and bad service do not help. I am amazed that this place is still running in this economy."}
{"text":"Nice simple Indian food ....had South Indian and Punjabi dishes for 10.99 and good sweets as we'll... Fresh dosa and paratha served on table..."}
{"text":"Pulling up to Udupi, we were very happy to see that the buffet was still open. We were starving and the promise of the unlimited food sounded amazing. I ordered the Chai Tea, then rushed over to the buffet. I heaped all different kinds of Indian foods onto my plate. When I returned to my table I dug in, it was delicious. Especially one dish, upma! This upma has inspired my mom and I to start cooking Indian food. But our upma has never been good enough to compare with Udupi's, so we still make the 30 minute drive out to Parma. I don't understand why people are commenting on the service, ours is always very nice and friendly. This is real authentic Indian, and it is absolutely delicious. One side note is  if you are interested in trying only one dish, order off the menu. The quality of the buffet food is a little lower than the food on the menu. Udupi serves up really good Indian food at low prices, and it has a really unique menu."}
{"text":"Went their today and we ordered two items for the lunch. They said it will take half an hour to make the order. We waited for like 45 minutes but they didn't show up. Then we asked why they are taking such a long time, one girl came to us and told that they were stuck. Are you kidding me? After an hour they said we are stuck? Poor customer service. You guys should improve on that."}
{"text":"Very good Indian. Bad decor and service. Also should clean the place better. But probably the best south Indian in Cleveland area.  I would have given it a 5 start had the service been good at all.

However, if you want authentic south Indian food, this place will hit the spot."}
{"text":"South Indian food in Cleveland !  So excited !

Went here with a friend on a cold lazy Sunday afternoon.  It looked promising - sambar ( a really hot spicy indian lentil based soup), iddli (a bread like substance made from rice), and dosas, all of which I love, and a smattering of North Indian options as well.

As other yelpers mentioned, the service was buffet stye and a iittle slow, but that's ok - this is a place to relax.

I should mention the menu is pure veg and there is a pretty nice Indian grocery next door for afterward (the nicest I've seen in CLE)"}
{"text":"This review was long overdue. For two reasons.... 

1. It's not Udupi Cafe anymore. It's Hyderbadi Biryani Cafe.

2. Their improved service.

I have been to this place under its previous management, and although the food then was good, the service wasn't. The new management has definitely hired an equally good chef and some good people in the serving area. A special shout out to this new girl they have hired, who was excellent in the service department. She was very patient, showed great interest in suggesting some good dishes, and did not mess up the order.

Must Try's: Chili paneer as an appetizer, methi paneer for entree, with naan or paratha, and egg biryani."}
{"text":"Udupi cafe is a specialized restaurant which serves only vegetarian (not vegan) cuisine from southern part of india. It goes without saying that the north indian dishes are not good. 

Ambiance is very nice. This place is very big and almost 80% empty every time I have been there. It is very nice for groups because there is plenty of space. They have some indian entertainment going on on TVs, which can be distracting and not entertaining. 

I was here a couple of times and had their lunch buffet. It is nice to have many options at reasonable price. It has good selection of different varieties from both south and north indian cuisine. I like their south indian food. I have been here once in the evening when we ordered from the menu and all the south indian dishes were very good. The flavor is very good and food quantity is enough to feed one person. 

I have read other reviews and feels like this place is not so consistent in the quality of food. I have yet to have a bad experience so I am going to go with 4/5 stars for a very nice south indian vegetarian restaurant. 

If you know what belongs to south indian cuisine on the menu, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Udipi Cafe has been one of those places for me that gives you one great meal on your first day, and then never another good one after. You just keep going back with that initial thought of that first meal, but are met with disappointment thereafter, till you just get fed up. And that is what I am fellow yelpers.

This place is a primarily south Indian restaurant serving a variety of South Indian cuisine. However, as it stands, the food is just not worth it to make the trip out to this place! The idlis are consistently dry and rubbery, the Dosas greasy, and the vadas dry and unappetizing. 

Couple that to the apathetic and lackadaisical service, and I don't know why you would come to this place. If you are hankering for South Indian food, try Priya's.

The only thing keeping this place at 2 Stars is that it has a decent sambhar and chutneys."}
{"text":"I placed an order online that was confirmed and supposed to be ready within 60-70 minutes. I showed up to pick up my order and the host was somewhere in the back so I want sure where to go for a moment and when he came up I told him I was there to pick up my order. He clearly had no idea what I was talking about so maybe something glitched (not necessary his fault). He hurried back to the kitchen and I heard him talking to the chef to get my order ready. It was out quickly (for them having just started it) and I didn't notice until I got home that I didn't get the rice that was supposed to come with my meal. It was just the curry and the naan I paid for separately. The food was alright, but I don't particularly recommend it after this experience."}
{"text":"The name has recently changed - as well as the ownership. I hadn't been in over a year (Parma is a hike), and always thought they had the best dosas. This time it was ok - the dosa was huge - but the stuffing was minuscule in comparison. It was also crispier than I remembered. My favorite part has always been the coconut chutney and it didn't disappoint. We were the only people there near closing on a Friday night, so the service was quick. The space is big, but outdated (it is in a strip mall) - so don't expect fancy. I'd try it again if I was in the area, but it's likely not worth the drive anymore. Sad!!"}
{"text":"Udupi remains some of the best Indian food I've ever had.  Gigantic yet delicate dosa, bright, complex flavors.  Our favorite dishes are the special rava masala dosa and the vegetable korma.  The chana batura is certainly an impressive spectacle, though not my number 1 (a bit greasy).  And don't miss the out of control lunch buffet, which is insanely great.  The Indian grocery next store - complete with a candy counter proffering delicious kaju katli - sometimes stays open late, so you can stroll in after dinner.  God, writing this review is nostaligicizing the crap out of me.  Udupi is great: go out of your way to eat there!!"}
{"text":"We are really happy to have found this 100% vegetarian Indian spot. We had the lunch buffet and it was amazing! High quality southern Indian cuisine. Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"The very first Indian dinner I ever had was a masala dosa, sambhar, and aloo bonda in a restaurant in NYC that a friend took me to. It was love at first bite, and I have been addicted to the above dishes ever since! I am always on the search for a fantastic masala dosa, which I have now found at Udupi-the perfect crispy to soft crepe proportion, as well as stuffed with a lot of savory spiced potato filling! And then aloo bonda...delicious balls of savory potato goodness that are rolled in besan (chickpea flour) and fried, and accompanied by a delicious chutney. And we can't forget sambhar, the richly spiced (and often spicy!) vegetable stew that dosas often get dipped into!
Back home in NY, I would regularly order masala dosas any time I needed to satiate my craving. When I moved to Cleveland though, I couldn't find any dosas that reminded me of home, which made me unreasonably sad! Then I heard about this place called 'Udupi' and I read about their fantastic dosas...and their $5 Wednesday dosa nights! My husband and I decided to take the chance and try them out one Wednesday, and we're so glad that we did! These dosas at Udupi are some of the best I've had (and that's saying something!). We've been back since our first taste and we enjoyed it just as much as our first venture there. We know that we will keep going back whenever that dosa craving hits!
Besides dosas, there is a varied vegetarian menu to explore, as well as a lunchtime buffet that, judging by their Facebook videos, looks great! We hope to check that out soon as well. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean as well. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for dosa night on Wednesday. The dosa's were very yummy. Will definitely recommend giving them a chance."}
{"text":"Udupi was my first experience eating Indian food.  It appealed to me since I was a vegetarian.  The food is okay, but I blame this place for my wife's reluctance to eat Indian food.  It wasn't until I forced (okay... not forced, I chose to eat at India Garden in Lakewood for my birthday, so she couldn't refuse) her to eat somewhere else that she realized that she liked Indian food.

Don't get me wrong, I liked this place... but I have had better.  Most Indian restaurants have plenty of vegetarian options, but the nice thing about this place is there are no worries, since everything is vegetarian."}
{"text":"The food was incredible.  Also the service was stellar.   Everyone was so friendly and quick to answer any questions we had!   The buffet had a lot of variety!  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing southern style Vegan food, I knew the food was going to be good as soon as I had a sip of their tasty mango lassi, we had the cheese dosa, I forgot which curry but which ever you pick you won't be disappointed, and for dessert we tried like a cheese with condensed milk type mix was super good, service was great and had some Bollywood on the screen to keep ya entertained overall really good Indian food"}
{"text":"One of the worst Indian Restaurants in Cleveland.  Food was below standard. Once I had gone along with my parents for Dinner. We had ordered Bhajjis , Rava Dosa and Onion Utappa. 

Bhajjis were horrible. Panner was hard like rock inside, Onions were soft not crunchy, chillis were old like dead stem.

Rava Dosa and Onion Utappa was way too oily and sambhar which is usually served was watery and chatni I believe the coconut was smelling horrible.

When complaint, they boldly said \"This is their standard of cooking\" Too rude . We simply walked out without paying a penny."}
{"text":"This place is now called Hyderabad Biryani corner.Our experience at this restaurant was disappointing to say the least.Everything we ordered was TERRIBLE, starting with the lassi. The papdi chat was dry and had no topping sauces at all, tasteless. The masala dosa was tasteless and rubbery. My husband's uttappam was dry, hard and had stale curry leaves on it, terrible tasting again.Maybe it was frozen food, microwaved and served. The service was bad too. Our orders were mixed up, wrong dish served etc. We were so disappointed we spoke to the owners and told them the food quality was bad and we found that they were quite indifferent about it too!"}
{"text":"It's under new management. The service was friendly but there was lots of confusion. We tried to order several items only to be told later they didn't have them. I ordered mango lassi only to be brought a beer. They have 30 tables and apparently only three menus. Our table of three had to share one menu. The food was good though."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I am always happy to visit this place!   My only wish: they had a \"cheat sheet\".  Lots of Mexican restaurants have a 'glossary of food' and I think it would be helpful if Udupi Cafe had something like that.  I have eaten here a few times and I'm always pleased!"}
{"text":"If, like many Americans, you've only dined at Continental style Indian restaurants, which are kind of a greatest hits selection of food found around that vast country, then I recommend you head to Udupi Café and try some Southwestern regional Indian food. The chefs of the state of Udupi in India are known throughout the country for their exceptional vegetarian cuisine (Udupi is predominantly Hindu, and Hindus are usually vegetarians), and this recently opened restaurant represents in a big way. I'm not sure if this restaurant is part of a chain or franchise, but I've dined at Udupi Cafes from Pennsylvania to North California; there's even one in Washington state; and they're very similar. I like to start a meal here with rasam, a nuclear level spiced broth that wakens the palate in a big way. I also like the dosas, which are thin rice & gram flour crepes with different fillings; my favorite is the masala dosa, which is filled with spiced potatoes and comes with coconut chutney and sambar, a thick soup. You know that game that chefs and foodies play, where they decide what their last meal on earth will be? Masala dosa is mine, so to say I \"like\" it is a bit of an understatement. My partner and I usually share one of these and a curry. The veggie curries are very different here; many are very spicy, some are less so and feature a dairy base, and some have a coconut base. The veggie korma had the requisite richness, but I didn't like the broccoli in it. I'm pretty sure they don't use broccoli in Southern India, and would love to try this dish with the veggies they use there. This was the only miss for me, and I still love this place. Other things to try here are the vegetable cutlets (weird name, great appetizer) and the pistachio ice cream, which was outstanding. Eat your way through the menu here! It's terrific."}
{"text":"Wonderful vegetarian food! Pani Puri ,Filled Dosas, Idli and light milky little cottage cheese balls yummy with nice hot tea. The service was attentive and super welcoming!Nice price great meal highly recommend

Thanks Udupi we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch on a Saturday. I do understand that a Saturday afternoon is an odd time to come into a restaurant, which might explain the lack of people when I visited or my bad experience here given that this place is decently rated on Yelp, but based on my visit I would give this place less than a star if I could. I had the dhai vada, the paneer dosa, and some of the fried idli. Neither my dhai vada nor my paneer dosa tasted anything like what it should have, nor was it fresh by any means. The dhai vada was cold all the way through and had become dense and hard in the center as it would be after being refrigerated for some time. Even the yogurt was very cold which makes me think that there wasn't even an attempt to make it feel as though it wasn't just pulled out of a refrigerated container. The paneer dosa was the same way...burning hot on the outside as if it had been nuked in the microwave and very dry through the middle. Additionally, there was no paneer in it, but rather this \"paneer\" was shredded mozzarella or a similar cheese. I could tell because paneer would not typically melt in the manner that the cheese inside here had. In my opinion, there is really no excuse for serving anything that is less than freshly prepared food at a restaurant. This is what customers go in expecting to pay for; this is what they should receive. I find it hard to imagine that overhead is any sort of excuse for this. Tip: if you don't have the demand for the food in your restaurant, don't prepare it ahead of time and store it. Don't prepare food in bulk if you're not a catering service. And definitely not worth cutting corners by storing previously prepared food because it is easy...I doubt it's fooling anyone. I would rather you take your time in the kitchen or tell me that you have run out of something, rather than bring me reheated food in the first 5 mins like this place did. And paneer is not just a synonym for any type of cheese you want it to be. Paneer is a specific type of cheese, please don't falsely advertise."}
{"text":"Udupi cafe is no more. Kind of sad to see it go. New place is nothing to write home about. Quite ordinary and the wait staff was atrocious."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I was expecting small portions because the prices are so reasonable, but no, huge portions! Lots of vegan options. Great addition to the area! Staff was all super friendly and service was quick. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating no wait time and prompt service. The food is good and reasonably priced, much better than many Indian food joints across the country. 

Very good South Indian flavours, average North Indian preparations. We went there for southern flavours and returned sattisfied. 

Tried the all vegiterian buffet, liked the Dosa, Vada, Sambar and Matar Paneer. The Iddlys were a bit dry but the coconut chutny made up for it. Medium-to-hot tasting flavors maintained authenticity. 

Will definitely revisit the place."}
{"text":"The buffet is nice, but slow.

When you need real service, though, it's a super gamble. Sometimes you get an ornery high schooler, sometimes its the BOH chef in his dirty apron, sometimes it's fantastic.

DON'T USE THEIR BATHROOMS.

I like the paneer, dosas and coffee."}
{"text":"As a lover of spice and multi cultural traditional fare I really LOVED Udupi Cafe.  I found this restaurant when searching for Vegetarian establishments and was extremely pleased.  I had learned there was a buffett, however it was not available during my visit.  I am not very familiar with Indian food, however I tried the appetizer platter.  It appeared fried however it was not soaked in grease.  I did really enjoy it.  I also ordered Chana Masala but was turned onto the Chana Bathura.  delcious!  reminded me of a cedar point elephant ear without the sugar.  this was delicious and left me very full.  My girlfriend had a curry dish that was exquisite.  I CANT WAIT to go back here."}
{"text":"If you leave hungry, there is something majorly wrong with you. The food is abundant and absolutely unreal. As a vegetarian, I was stoked to find this joint and know that nothing was \"off limits.\" It's not fancy or even decorative, but the food keeps me coming back. Best recent find in awhile."}
{"text":"We went to Udipi / Hyderabad Biryani House for dinner and ordered a masala dosa and a butter masala dosa. The dosas were over done, way to crisp. The crepe was gigantic in size, but the potato stuffing inside was rather small. The samber was too hot, although the coconut chutney was good. We had also ordered chai and it was authentic indian chai. The food was relatively inexpensive. 2 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not a specialist in Indian food, but I really enjoyed my dinner here! My dad and I went Thursday night, so I helped myself to the chat buffet while he sampled the malai kofta. The menu had good descriptions of the food and it's components, but the buffet only had labels for the food. I have only a fragment of an idea of what I ate, but I can tell you it was delicious! 

I highly recommend visiting Udupi Cafe, especially if you're a vegetarian, and even if you have little exposure to Indian food. Quick, discreet service and lots of tasty food!"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you will be surprised by how BIG this place actually is. 
We arrived at about 6pm and were pleasantly surprised to find that from 5pm-7pm, the entire menu is 30% off. 

We started off with the Veggie samosas as an appetizer. The order came with 2 large samosas that were fresh, and just delicious! I especially enjoyed this with the minty sauce (one sauce of the two it came with...the other was a sweet sauce) which balanced very well with the spiciness of the samosa. 

For my main, I went for the Paneer Makhana curry with rice. The curry itself had good flavour, nice \"umami\"...however there wasn't as much paneer as I would have liked. 

Hubby went for the Masal Dosai - a huge crispy crepe filled with potatoes and onions. Very spicy. This was our first time eating any sort of Dosai so played around with sauce combinations. (without, with one sauce, two mixed, etc. haha). It was good. 

By the end of our meal, we both agreed that this was a place we would return to. Good food, good prices especially during happy hour and prompt service. 

For those of you who are curious about decor and such...this is a place where you go for the food, not the ambiance. The decor is not especially new and could probably use some updating, however it was fairly clean and organized."}
{"text":"our group did the lunch buffet during the week. the wait staff was helpful and answered questions. there was good variety and dishes I'd never seen before. we had a great time."}
{"text":"Udupi Cafe is a great place to go if you're looking for a mostly vegetarian meal. I think they offer meat now but I haven't seen it on the buffet yet. Most places in my area are North Indian restaurants so trying something that is South Indian is pretty refreshing every now and then. One of the things that stands out most is the bhatura bread, order a chana bhatura if you want a unique meal. The regular vegetable curry if ordered off the menu tastes very good and can be spicy if you ask for a high heat level(1-10) but the buffet is very Americanized and tastes a bit too much like tomato sauce for some reason. Still, it's a good buffet if you enjoy a lot of potatoes and carrots. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a cheap place to eat Indian on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Food was worst. Better dont go. Its better having bread at home. It is south indian but chutneys was worst i ever had."}
{"text":"Went here once last year under the old management and this past week with the new management.  I am vegetarian and my husband is not, but the food was so good he didn't mind that they removed all meat options :)  Less sweet coconut bases are being used now and it is way yummier in my opinion! As another reviewer stated, it is more a blend of North and South Indian now.  Dosais are very spicy and come with the buffet.  Yummy!  Great to see a local restaurant embrace vegetarian menus!  Plus, you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I was here many years ago and did not enjoy it that much but since then it seems as if the cook has changed. The food was delicious!  My group and I all has dosas. I had a paper masala dosa and it was phenomenal!  They served it quite fast and to the taste of the hot food with the sambar was just perfect to warm you all the way down to your soul!  The service was very efficient and very nice!  I saw an elderly man who was sitting near our table when we were seated and he was having a little difficulty communicating in English and the staff there quite effortlessly and tactfully slipped into Hindi in such a way that even the elderly gentleman did not realize it. It was heartwarming to see someone go to that extent to help someone out!  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"We came at 3 Pm and were shown the buffet. It looked nice with a lot of variation but they did not refill a single item. When asked they kept saying we will but nothing was done. There were a lot of customers for the buffet but it was useless service.
The uttapam took forever to arrive and when it did it was as hard as a rock, made it feel like it came from the freezer. The owner lady kept saying why should they refill the buffet since there are only 6-7 people for that.
Overall a very bad experience. Hope they can improve."}
{"text":"Amazing fabulous Indian food, well worth the drive to Parma! This place is the best Indian food in Cleveland!  Don't miss the Dosai, Mattar Paneer, or Vegetable Makani."}
{"text":"Wish I could give less than 1 star.. 

We went for a lunch buffet on Sunday and Everything that someone could wrong was wrong in this place..

1. The dishes and bowls were all super-dirty.. With oil and food stains all over them..  Looks like these guys don't use dishwashers at all..

2. The food was terrible.. Except for the watermelon, everything else was pathetic.. Worst Indian food I have ever had!

3. The price was way too high for a mediocre fare and ambience.. I have paid the same in fine dining restaurants in San Francisco with FAR better food and ambience

4. No service to speak of.. I had to pick up glasses and tissues from a neighboring table myself and ask 4 different folks for a jug of water!

I guess being one of the very few Indian restaurants around, these guys are able to get by.. Maybe some competition from the new places like Choolah will set them right!"}
{"text":"We first ate at the Udupi Cafe this past winter and were really disappointed....that it took us so long to discover it! 

The food is beyond delicious, everything is vegetarian, and the service is great! 

We've only ordered off the menu once, and everything was superb. However, because my husband likes to try lots of different things, we mainly come for the buffet ($9.99 on the weekends). We go to the lunch buffet at least once a weekend and have gone to a few of the Tuesday Night special Dosa Buffets. We absolutely love the sweet lady who works there and always treats us like family when we walk in. 

The buffet selections change from day-to-day so if we taste something really good on the buffet, chances are, we won't see it again for months, but we could always just order it off the menu as well. Some of my favorite items are the vegetable biryani rice, a creamy dish similar to mutter paneer, but with potatoes and peas instead of paneer, and a really delicious sauteed cabbage dish. Also, the masala tea that is part of the buffet is soooooo delicious - if I could handle all the dairy, I'd probably drink 100 cups!

With the buffet, they serve gigantic masala dosas - flat rice crepes filled with curried potatoes (similar to samosa fillings). I love to dip parts of it into the cilantro chutney sauce. Yum!

I don't know that much about the regional differences in Indian food - a lot of other Yelp reviews mention that it's Southern Indian food. I did notice, the first time we visited, that we didn't see the \"typical\" Indian fare on the menu (ie, tikka masala, naan, etc.). It seems to me that the kind of food that is served at Udupi is more plant-based (lots of veggies and greens and chickpeas)m, which we happen to love, but might not appeal to those who prefer the more rich Indian dishes (like pieces of paneer cheese in creamy curry sauce).

The Udupi Cafe is a gem!!"}
{"text":"I went by Cleveland on office work. when I hunt down veggie lover eatery. I discovered this place. I adore the Pongal here this was my most loved dish which recalls that me the Tamil style."}
{"text":"This is a vegetarian restaurant only!  If they served meat I would give them 5 stars.  One of the best Indian restaurants I have been too although I am no expert."}
