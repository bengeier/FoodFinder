{"text":"Visited this place again, with my clan, for my mom's birthday, and now it's been officially confirmed as their new favorite Indian restaurant as well. Or maybe that's just because we're in the same family, we have the same tastes, but whatever, try it out aleady!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best East Indian/Sri Lankan food I have ever eaten. I could try to describe how amazing and flavorful it was, but I wouldn't do it justice. Go in and try for yourself!! I definitely reccomend this place!
Bonus: our server gave us a free platter with our meal! How often does that happen!?
If I didn't live so far away from this place, I would eat there every day haha"}
{"text":"Heard about this little place in FFWD last year. Have since been back twice with other friends and family. There arent enough words to describe how amazing the food is, and you can tell its cooked with love. The staff are friendly are so accomodating, and the prices better than any other Indian/ Sri Lankan restaurant Ive visited. Its a small and simple restaurant which is exactly why its so appealing. Only clincher is the crappy parking, but its worth the few block walk, if you cant find any in front of the restaurant. Cant wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Am not giving it 5 stars only because it was not very clean, but totally bearable. The service & most important the food (we ordered masala & plain dossas) were excellent. Another thing, in places that serve spicy cuisine, usually the ventilation is really poor, hence these places reek of spicy smell, not here. Cross ventilated. This will remain our go to place for dossas!"}
{"text":"Exactly what what  Shannon H.'s has said.
In her in depth negative review.
Please read her full review we lived what she had experienced.

Only one other table of two in the restaurant,we were in first, put our order in first and got served last.
 The Dosa was OK but contained hard undercooked lentils.
Yes it is long and flops on the dirty table.
The fish pakora was watery,bland,
The potato paratha which you can buy at the wholesale club in the freezer section for $3.25/ 5 pc was $5.99/pc at the Dosa Corner
 One item at a time and expect 10 min between each item.

I can not believe that people have given this place high marks in taste ,it is the blandest Indian restaurant I have been  to.
For price point a $5.00 special lunch Dosa is better than McDonald's,
 
 However don't bother with either and just go on 17th ave you will probably have better luck than at the Canada Dosa Corner  ."}
{"text":"Ambience: ok to poor. 
Taste: ok to poor. Uttapam wasn't cooked well. Sambar was too salty

Overall, didn't enjoy our dinner here. Went seeing the 4 stars. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Thanks to a post on You Gonna Eat That, I decided to try out Canada Dosa Corner. I'm always looking for new \"hole in the wall\" type places in the NE to try. Definitely head over to her blog to get the full back story scoop on this restaurant.....now on to the food.

I had never been to a Sri Lankan restaurant before so I wasn't sure what to expect. The owner was very helpful in giving recommendations about what to order. Unfortunately, the menu doesn't have any descriptions or pictures so you are kind of lost unless you get help or know Sri Lankan food. I've eaten their twice and both times I got ulundu vadai to start with string hoppers with chicken korma and korthu for the main course. The ulundu vadai is like a savory deep fried donut served with a spicy sauce. String hoppers are vermicelli noodle nests that you spoon the korma (curry) over. Korthu is a chopped dish that has onions, bread, egg, meat and ????. It's kind of like a hash. It's spicier than you would think since it's not saucy at all.

Overall the food is very, very good. I find it very inexpensive for all the food you get. It is quite spicy. I think the spice is nice but my Canadian friends have mentioned that is quite spicy to them. The owner is very nice as well and very appreciative of the business. It seems to be her & one other lady working there so if you walk in & no one comes to help you, you should let them know you are there. The food is very fresh & is made to order. It is not super fast but you can get in and out for lunch in 1 1/2 hours.

One thing to mention....I found that the food was very different the two times I visited. Great both times but not the same. I was okay with that but it might bug some people. It's also hard to get exactly what you had the time before b/c they will often throw things in & then when you ask for it they're not exactly sure what you are asking for.

Sorry for the long review. I would definitely recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The real reason I went here was because a little bird told me they have 'Kothu Roti'. If you dont know what it is, go and try it. If you do know what it is, yes, Canada Dosa Corner has it!!

This place is perhaps best known for its Dosas, but like I said, I had an ulterior motive. After my terrified realization some months back that there were no Sri Lankan restaurant in Calgary that serves 'Kothu Roti', I was quite ready to write off this delicacy as a chapter in my life that would stay buried in my past (read: Montreal) forever. But then I heard of Canada Dosa Corner, and heard it was Sri Lankan... With fire in my eyes and rumbling in my belly, I jumped on my computer to see their menu, and lo and behold! They had my beloved 'Kothu Roti' listed under their 'Specialities'! And 4 different kinds at that!!! 

Can you imagine my joy?!

So off I went last night! It was a small, modest establishment just off International Avenue. As we sat down, we knew exactly what we wanted. We opted for the Chicken Kothu Roti, the Chilli Chicken (another fond favourite - but for those of you not good with spices, stay FAR away) and the Goat Dosa. We figured we might as well try the Dosa since it was what the restaurant was known for. The Kothu Roti came first. We dug in. It was a bit different from what I had before, but it was DELICIOUS nonetheless! Kothu Roti is a Sri Lankan dish made from chopped pieces of bread, vegetables, meat and egg and flavoured with mouth-watering spices. One bowl (they served it in a bowl) was enough to feed two people. Then came our goat Dosa. The Dosa was perfectly made, and the goat curry it was stuffed with was once again, delicious. The Dosa was served with 3 different dipping sauces. Once again, a huge portion that would leave one person sufficiently stuffed. Then came the Chilli Chicken with a bowl of steamed rice. Goodness, they dont mess around with their chilli! This dish was SPICY! The sauce almost had an Asian taste to it. I might say this was my least favourite dish of the three, but was still REALLY tasty! 

When we were nearing the end of our meal, Mary - the owner - started telling us the story of her life and how she got to Canada Dosa Corner from Sri Lanka. I won't divulge any details, but let me tell you - that is one heck of a heart-wrenching story. 

All in all, the food here is amazing. The price is reasonable. The owner is friendly. And to top it all off, they serve AMAZING Kothu Roti. If I still have not convinced you to go try it, I should probably just stop writing reviews altogether."}
{"text":"Not clean place. No service at all ( they don't even give spoons until you ask for).
Dosas are thick, I am fond of crispy thin dosas. No good sambhar or chutney either. 
Overall bad experience. I wasted money trying to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this restaurant changed addresses, but I would have appreciated them telling me that on the phone before I left to pick up my takeaway.  Fortunately the old store has a sign with the new address (5320 8th Ave. SE) and it's only a block or two away.  

They also left their old website up (the new one is .com, not .ca) with the incorrect information on it.  Even the new one has Google Maps pointing to the old address, but the sidebar text has the newly updated address.

So these things, plus the fact that they missed my phone call and had to call me back, plus a couple other small things, makes it clear that this isn't a polished operation yet.  But the Sri Lankan chicken curry I ordered was delicious, was nice and spicy (I got to choose, so I chose 8 out of 10 on the spiciness meter), and thankfully didn't give me the feeling that it was a version built for the Canadian palate.

I wasn't in the mood for a dosa this time, but when I get my next craving for one I will look forward to dining here."}
{"text":"The only place with good dosa in Calgary... unfortunately, they're closed permanently"}
{"text":"So something must have changed between when we came here and the rest of the reviewers, because this is the *first time in my life* I've ever walked out on a meal before they finished serving.  Let me describe my experience.

Service:
There was one other table when we came in, and although they had 2 servers working they never once came to our table to refill drinks or see how things were without us calling them over.  The water tasted like it had chalk in it - not sure if the glasses weren't clean or they are bringing in their own water source; I've tasted Calgary tap water, it doesn't taste that bad.  All 4 people at the table ordered bottled drinks after one taste of the water.  They would only bring one thing out (to a table of 4!) at a time, with a 5-10 minute gap between EVERY dish.  I asked if he could take our dinner order THREE TIMES and he actually refused.  He told me to wait until he'd brought all the appetizers before we were allowed to order the main course.  Of course this meant a 20 min wait between the last appetizer and first main course.  The server NEVER ONCE cleared away dirty dishes or cups, so by the time we got to the main course we had a couple big piles of dishes stacked up on the end of our table.  I had to ask him to take them away, and even when I did that he ONLY took away one pile, the other one was still there when we abandoned ship.

Food:
Of the three appetizer dishes the first one was actually decent but every subsequent dish went downhill from there.  The remaining appetizers were over fried, lacking in filling and bland.  The first Main course was served alone, with over a 10 min wait until the next one, so the table passed the one plate around and everyone had a bite.  Again, bland, uninspired and the crepe-like bread was so large that it rested on the table on either side.  When the second main dish came out (some kind of fried rice) we all had a taste and everyone agreed that it was the worst we'd had.  After tasting it you immediately got an aftertaste of rancid fat in your mouth, so the dish basically sat untouched.  We left before trying the third.

While waiting the requisite 10 minutes for the next main to come out we all kind of stared at each other and decided we needed to go somewhere to wash the taste out of our mouths, so we paid (full price, even for the dishes that didn't get delivered!!) and walked out.

Ambiance:
I don't mind a little run-down charm, but this place was a joke.  The one sign on the outside had the words 'EVEREST RESTAUARANT(sic!) SRI LANKAN FILIPINO' with the EVEREST and FILIPINO coloured in with a sharpie, so evidently they changed their menu but didn't bother to change the sign.  The one over the door is a worn out sagging banner.  The music was a bollywood film that would freeze for about half a second every 3 seconds, but I never got to ask the server to fix it because by the time he emerged from the kitchen after taking our appetizer order (20 min later) the film had finished and was showing test pattern.  The plates were a mix of dollar store plastic and the prison 'individual food compartment' tin serving trays.  

This restaurant was so far beyond terrible that I'd rate it a -5 if I could.  The only thing good about the experience is that it was desperately terrible for everyone that we could do nothing but laugh about it.  

DO NOT GO HERE unless you are a food masochist."}
{"text":"Warning! The food here is pretty gosh darn spicey! My east indian Spice-ego got the best of me and decided to take on something a tad spicey. A 5/10 on the spice radar got my taste buds flamin'! The staff was awesome, they gave me a fresh new plain Dosa after they realized the one I had was taking out all my taste buds, one by one.

Keep in mind they recently moved from their location on 17th ave SE up further north to 8th ave SE (both along 52nd street). The address wasn't updated on google but it may be okay for you future yelpians reading this review.

Be sure to calm the taste buds down with some masala chai at the end of the meal. Whatever spice level you think you can handle, take it down a couple pegs and try it from there. Its easier to spice things up than to spice things down.

Enjoyy!"}
{"text":"Oh the dosa - I love your golden and crispy outside and soft white insides.  dipped in the authentic south indian chutneys and sambar.  I felt like I was back in a small dosa hut in Mysore.

It was a 7pm dinner, and we had the place to ourselves and we had a great chat with Mary the owner.  Once this place gets discovered, it will be very busy.  Yes, they have other things on the menu, but the dosas are what my family came for.  Seeing my little one (4 yr old) was having trouble with the little spice there was in the masala dosa, Mary brought her some less spice masala filling on the side.

She also brought us some complementary veg pakoras and even a free refill on the mango lassi.  holy cow, you don't see that these days

We could not finish all 4 dosas, and will eat them for lunch tomorrow.  The prices are also very reasonable.

The decor is typical indian, with a few nice touches, but on the whole it feels like south India - other than the -20C outside.

Well worth a try if you like dosas"}
{"text":"Amazing food with great flavour; such a great experience.  I had the Mysore masala dosa with a sweet lassi; wow."}
