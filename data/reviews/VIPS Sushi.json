{"text":"Opening Special: $7.99 (reg. 9.99) for many rolls. Ordered the Lady in Red and Sunrise rolls. The ingredients inside these 2 rolls were the same but we preferred the crab on the Lady in Red. 

Our server was friendly and attentive. 

The store is very small with only 2 tables of 4 seats. 

Free delivery available over $20 and within the delivery area. 

The 7.99 deal is great and hopefully they can keep it."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with their sushi! They're fresh, generous portions, and super yummy. I especially love their spicy salmon crunch roll :) they put so much salmon in it, it's absolutely heavenly. We also tried their lady in red, rainbow dragon, and tiger rolls. They were all superb :) this has become my new favourite sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"my go to place. love their spicy salmon roll"}
{"text":"Chefs and servers are really kind and the food was awesome. I will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite sushi place in Toronto! They're sushi rolls are such high quality and consistently so. I love their dynamite rolls, sunset roll, rainbow roll.. anything there that includes the crab meat and shrimp is delicious. Maybe it's just me but stay away from the sushi maki rolls with cream cheese. (Not sure who decided on that combination when choosing the menu) 

Service is attentive and quick. A couple of maki rolls are usually ready in 10 mins. If you dine in (only 2 tables available) grab some green tea or they give you water in a cute mason jar glass."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, and did not disappoint! 
The rolls are massssssive so order less than you usually would.
The white dragon roll was heavenly and I will have dreams about it for awhile."}
{"text":"Currently my fave sushi spot. The white lady roll is amazingly scrumptious. :) my fianc√© likes to get the green dragon roll. It's a small little shop with very little seating so get take out and bring cash/debit when you drop by."}
{"text":"TL;DR - They missed one piece of sashimi in my combo. Rolls are not that special. For \"cheap\" sushi takeout, I'll stick with Sushi Bong.

---

This will be a short review for take-out that I got from VIPS last weekend.  My boyfriend and I drove out to VIPS specifically to get some take-out because we heard good things about their specialty rolls.  There's about 8 seats in the small hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant but everyone seems to just order take-out here because there were boxes and bags stacked everywhere.

We heard good things about their specialty tataki rolls and got the BC Albacore Tuna and the 9,6 Sashimi, Sushi combo.  The tataki roll didn't have as much tuna as I thought, pretty thinly sliced on the top and resembled white tuna (which it could've been...for all I know).  The roll itself was bigger than average but not HUGE.  The sashimi, sushi combo was alright as well but I was disappointed that they missed a piece!! It's supposed to come with 9 sashimi pieces and 6 sushi.  You can see in the photo that I only got TWO tuna pieces so I'm incredibly disappointed that they would miss a piece that easily.  How do you miscount up to three?

Altogether we paid just over $30 with taxes (and no tip) for this meal.  Definitely on the higher end for take-out sushi and I was expecting better with all the positive reviews.  The roll was not THAT unique that I would pay $13 for 8 pieces again.  Probably will not come back; if I'm looking for cheap sushi (and no missing sashimi pieces), I'd go to Sushi Bong.  Oh! And the prices have increased at least $1/item since the menu has been posted by other Yelpers."}
{"text":"I have been going to VIP Sushi for years. Some readers may remember the original VIP Sushi in Aurora which, in my opinion, was the best combination of sushi quality and price that I have come across. My friends and I mourned the loss of VIP Sushi in Aurora when it suddenly disappeared/went out of business. I was shocked and delighted one day to find VIP reincarnated in a small location just south of Finch off Yonge. 

It was the most excited I have ever been at seeing a restaurant because of all the great memories I shared at VIP Sushi in Aurora.

I am happy to say that the reincarnation of VIP once again offers their signature giant rolls at a great price. They have quite a few imaginative rolls such as White Dragon (Dragon roll with torched scallop on top),  Red Carpet (Spicy crab meat on top of Dragon) and White Christmas (banana on top with sweet potato, crab meat). Very cool and these choices keep the location from getting boring.

While the quality of the sushi cannot match experiences like Solo Sushi or Nami Sushi that is not what they are going for. Great quality, great quantity and great prices for westernized sushi with a twist. Go and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Moved to toronto less than a year. This is a place to go for quick sushi and roll. Didnt expect much from the outside but the food was great. Rolls were bigger than the other places and i could tell sashimi/sushi were fresh. Server was very attentive. definitely a place to visit again and again."}
{"text":"The spicy crunch tuna roll was awful. The filling was soaked with frying oil.

The filling is actually mixture of tempura bits and tuna. I guess they put tempura bits to make it crunchy. But they put way too much tempura bits and not much tuna. And tempura bits were absolutely soaked with frying oil.

After the meal, I felt like vomiting and was nauseous for three hours.

I don't know about the other menu items, but if you want to ingest ridiculous amount of frying oil, go ahead and order this roll.

I feel really sorry for my body."}
{"text":"Great place. Large portions, fresh sushi, great price and friendly service. 
I ordered delivery once and the delivery man was so nice and accommodating. 
This is definitely one of my regular sushi spots going forward"}
{"text":"Very delicious rolls. Big dish of rolls with very affordable price. They are on opening promotion right now, number of different rolls with only $8. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi places in the area. Some people may find those giant rolls to be worth it, but it's quality, not quantity. The sashimi slices were also cut thinly, so that was a huge disappointment. 

I won't be getting food from here again. I will be sticking to the higher class sushi establishments."}
{"text":"Food is great here! We certainly weren't expecting the portions to be so generous. We ordered the sunset and white dragon rolls, both were very tasty! We will definitely be ordering again from this sushi restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"If you like large sushi portion at a great price, you will enjoy this place.  I ordered the Golden Dragon to go, and was surprise to see the size of the roll.  Luckily I was hungrier than usual, and finished the who order.
 
Great value and fresh ingredients. 
Friendly service and very accommodating. 

I will give this place a try the next time I need a party sushi platter."}
{"text":"Called the restaurant in advanced. We a arrived (2 people), and the waitress said we had to wait for an hour because one of the chef did not come to work, and only one chef is currently working. We decided to wait. We sat down and the waitress immediately said \"what are you ordering? You can only order fast items.\" We asked her what that means, she said \"Only rolls and no big order. we said we'll take a look at the menu. When we were about to order, she said everything on the menu cannot be ordered because there's only one chef working. In actual wordings \"One chef did not come to work, so only one chef is working. We don't recommend you ordering sushi, sashimi and rolls. We only recommend ordering soup.\"

That being said, we were only ordering (1 rolls, and 1 small (15 pcs) sashimi. The waitress and the chef both said, no we cannot order that. They told us to order the soup.

All in all, Service is beyond horrible. If I can choose 0 Star, I would choose 0 star. Just because of the Service and experience. I will not recommend this place and will not come again."}
{"text":"I ordered this sushi today based on positive reviews.
How this restaurant has so many positive reviews is completely beyond me. This sushi was the worst most overpriced sushi I've ever had in my life. I almost threw up. If anyone eats sushi regularly then you know it needs to be fresh. This sushi is not. I had a platter of assorted sushi, spent almost $40 and the delivery driver took it upon herself to tip herself with my money which is completely unprofessional. I hope this place goes out of business. I'm so upset and I will never ever return."}
{"text":"Great food, very nice people
The place is more for pick ups , so there are only 2 tables in the restaurant 
We enjoy every dish we ordered"}
{"text":"Dining in won't be a great option as they are quite small. It's located on Yonge and a couple of blocks south of Finch. I am unsure if they serve buffet but, I do recall when I did order it; the service was good (not great), food quality was above average, and the price was I believe $25.   I only do delivery now and they accept cash only.   The price and quality is still above average and they provide the best value in North York, in my opinion.   I provided a high rating based on: service, quality, friendlines, price, and value in comparison to other sushi places around this area - I haved lived in North York for over 20 years and I have gone to all of them here."}
{"text":"Drove all the way down from Maple because we heard VIPS Sushi was great. Went in last week with my family and was blown away by the quality of everything on the menu. Because it's mainly just a take-out sushi place, I didn't expect much, but as soon as we saw the portions and had a taste, I knew this was not going to be my last visit.  

I'm actually mainly a salmon lover, but the best roll was the WHITE DRAGON, which is a super scrumptious roll layered with soft pieces of scallop that do not have a fishy or chewyness to it at all! 

We also had the SPICY SALMON CRUNCH, RED CARPET, and ALASKA rolls, $9.99 each!!! All super delish!!

I actually gave this place 5 stars for the quality of the food, but I give it one less star in my head because my 2 little kids do not enjoy sushi yet, so they just had the edamame beans, which by the way was a huge portion that was quickly devoured. 

Guaranteed no regrets with the food and service in both quality and quantity!"}
{"text":"This tiny sushi shop is right around the corner but they offer free delivery for orders over $20! Being the lazy person I am, I usually order an assortment of rolls delivered to my door. 

The prices are super reasonable - Have you seen the size of their rolls?! They're the size of my wrist and packed with ingredients. I love that they don't skimp on any material. My favorite rolls are the Sunset Roll and the Tuna Tataki Roll - both a must try!

The shop itself only seats six people, so most customers order take out or delivery. The delivery can take up to an hour sometimes, which is the only downside when they're busy. 

I don't recommend any of the sushi or sashimi platters. There's tons of food for what you order but the fish choices are very standard. I personally would go for their giant specialty rolls rather than plain rolls included in the platters. 

VIPs Sushi is the best place to get sushi at good value in the Yonge/Finch area! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decent prices and big portions! The white dragon roll is our favourite. Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's an OK spot to pick up some quick and relatively cheap sushi, though the quality is pretty much what you'd expect it to be (not the best nor the worst).  Would recommend getting sushi only for takeout rather than sitting in - even if you manage to grab one of two tiny tables, the door is constantly opening with people coming and going for takeout, which can make it feel like you're sitting outside in the winter or sweltering in the heat of summer.  VIPS accepts credit cards."}
{"text":"When you're running a small sushi joint close to Yonge and Finch, you inevitably will be compared to Sushi Bong. They have pioneered the big-rolls-good-value sushi takeout in this hood. I was skeptical about VIPS Sushi but it turns out that they can keep up with the Bong and carve out their own clientele niche. Any place that includes spicy mayo already gets extra points from me.

Order: Spicy Salmon Crunch Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll
Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Value: 4/5

$7.99 for crunch roll with lots of salmon (size of dynamite roll at Sushi Bong) and $4.99 for smaller spicy tuna roll was more than enough for my wife and me.  Service was friendly, but typical for takeout place.  VIPS Sushi is not a threat to Sushi Bong but a solid alternative when you want to mix it up. I will def go back and check out some of the other rolls."}
{"text":"Yup - diddo to all the other great reviews for this place. Have been living in the North York area for 30 years now! And only moved into this vicinity to find this Japanese gem. It really is a takeout place, but man, they are so fast and efficient. My hubby and I have always called and within 10 minutes, the order is ready. Now mind you, we just order the sashimi and a roll.

Would definitely come here to order their party platters because who doesn't love sushi/sashimi.

Service is always so pleasant and the ladies are so smiley. Such an easy process.

Yes, they do deliver for I believe a min of $20 but because we live like 2 minutes, it really is no problem for us to call and pick.

Haven't been to Sushi Bong so can't compare. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I was in desperate need to grab a quick bite before a meeting and was very short on time. I actually used my Yelp app and this place was the closest to meeting. The place is tiny with two tables for 4 and it's obvious that is more of a take out location. From the minute I walked in the 3 people working there were friendly, helpful and understanding about my short window on time. I also told them a few things I could not eat and the head sushi chef came to ask me if he should be aware of any other foods he needed to avoid for me and was genuinely concerned about my well being
My food came within minutes. Fish was fresh and quality was overall good. Staff inquired if I was happy and if they could do anything else to make my experience even better. 
This place is a true \"hole in the wall\" but I would go back without question and really liked the service."}
{"text":"Only 2 tables in the small restauarant but very sushi. I ordered a red snap and a tiger roll. Both very good and generous portions. 
Service was great. Went at maybe 7pm, the restaurant was empty so we managed to get 1 of the 2 tables. The decor and seating is more modern and comfortable than sushi bong. 

Updated 11/25/15 
I ordered from here again. Rainbow roll. There is no fish inside. There is fish on top of roll but only some of them since its rainbow. Sushi bong's rainbow roll is by far better. 

So if you are going to order the classic rolls, go to sushi bong. If you want the specialty rolls VIPs is good for that."}
{"text":"Seriously, I didn't walk in with any expectations at all. And still I was quite disappointed. 

They are busy with take-outs and phone ordering still at 9:30pm. 

Walked in, I planned to sit down and eat (I had dinner before coming here, but I was craving sushi like always). I took off my jacket, sat down, ordered and they gave me a takeout box in a plastic bag ready to go.

Sushi was meh. Wasn't super tasty or good deal. Maybe it was the roll I ordered (spicy salmon), but it wasn't tasty in terms I won't crave for it. Nothing wow about this and I wouldn't travel, park and order for this place on purpose"}
{"text":"Sushi was very good. I didnt like the environment but its a very good option for take out."}
{"text":"Too bad there isn't half stars on yelp. 
This place is definitely verging on a 4.5 - 5 star rating. 

True to size in the pictures, these rolls are HUMONGOUS. 

They are packed with amazing flavor that literally will explode in your mouth. 

Its safe to say that after my first experience here, they have dethroned Sushi Bong without a doubt. 

I ordered the White Dragon and Spicy Salmon Crunch roll. 

They were both to die for.

 The white dragon had scorched scallop on top which was unique and almost half the roll was filled with crab meat. I don't know how they season that crab but wow what a heavenly burst of flavors. 

The spicy salmon was so rich and decadent I think my brain was flooded by serotonin. 

For the sheer size and epic flavours of the sushi here, and at a budget friendly $9.99 for their most \"basic rolls\", you MUST try this place."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi spots! They have huge creamy crab salad sushi in them. I normally order the rainbow dragon roll. My favourite rolls from here is the rainbow dragon roll, white dragon, and orange dragon. They have just eats, take out and delivery."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Yonge and Finch, this is Korean-style sushi at its best. Find some of the largest maki rolls here with tons of variety. This is basically a takeout-only location, but this doesn't stop them! People are coming in all day ordering for lunch and dinner, and wait time is about 15-20min to make your rolls. 

They're super generous with their avocado, if that's a favourite of yours. Don't get me wrong - they're not cheating you of roll filling with cheaper alternatives, they're generous with all items and their proportions lead to more avocado and less rice. I much rather it this way - too much rice flips the scale the other way and makes my maki rolls very sad!

Maki rolls are the overwhelming majority of choices on the menu, though there are some other items - if you're looking for other more unique, gourmet items you'll have to go elsewhere!

For the convenience of location I'll definitely be back, however the downside is they only have street parking in front of them. If you live nearby or you're grabbing food to go elsewhere, they're a safe choice!"}
{"text":"VIPS is among my favorite non-AYCE sushi restaurants, simply because their maki deliciousness is absolutely off the charts! Despite the small space we've never had an issue , the place is mostly take out so people don't stay in long (but you can). Ingredient substitutions are not a problem, I've been there with a non-seafood eater friend who loved the food. If you love to experiment with food, they have some unusual maki choices too. Food is fresh and made right in front of you. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi around! 

This sushi place used to be located in Aurora but was moved down near Finch station a few years ago. The restaurant is quite tiny with only two tables as most customers get take out or delivery near finch station. 

This isn't AYCE but it is amazing, the rolls are very large and well worth the price ($10-12 each). One roll was more than enough to fill me up. I'll definitely be back to try other rolls and combo specials.

Must try: Spicy Salmon Crunch"}
{"text":"I've been going here since it first opened, and the rolls here are really good. I love the lady in red, its my favourite one from here. When they first opened for a while they had 2 dollar discount on their rolls but now the prices hiked a bit. Still I'm loving it. The actual restaurant is pretty small with only 2 seatings, so I usually do pick up.

I remember their sashimi being good too, but overall I'd recommend their rolls!"}
{"text":"A tiny place with 3 tables, better to take out, as it's open kitchen so it would be smoky when they deep fry something.

But the sushi were yum. huge rolls with lots of stuff inside, price was reasonable too."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via text, super convenient.  Waitress/waiter told me it would take 45 mins, it arrived in 10 mins... that was a nice surprise:) Sushi was great too! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi is reasonably priced and portion sizes are huge! The only down fall is the delivery time- the 2 times i've ordered via Just Eat I've waited an hour for my food to arrive and I live maybe about a 5-10 minute drive from the restaurant. Other than that, yummy !!"}
{"text":"I walked by VIPS Sushi - which is a relatively new sushi restaurant in North York.
They're having an opening special, 7.99 for some of their special rolls.

The rolls remind me a lot of Sushi Bong - they are absolutely huge!  Each piece is about the size of an oreo cookie.  They were so big, that each roll needed their own box.  I ordered the spicy tuna crunch, which had a lot of spicy tuna, with an interesting kick.  I also ordered the golden ball, which had mango on top, with unagi and crab
Each roll also came with a side of spicy mayo sauce and generous amounts of wasabi.
I could also taste the freshness of the ingredients.
Very innovative rolls, although maybe not authentic Japanese sushi, I really enjoyed both rolls.
I could only finish 1 roll, as they were so big!

I would definitely recommend trying VIPS Sushi!  The service is very friendly, and with so much variety you can try a different roll every day for over a month!  The space is very small, you can eat in, but probably better for take-out.

If you like Sushi Bong, you will like VIPS Sushi even better"}
{"text":"Best sushi delivery for who lives in Yonge and finch. I ordered the delivery on just eat. And it came right on time. The sashimi was really fresh so was the sushi. Best sushi delivery yet in this region."}
{"text":"Got black dragon and tiger again since I enjoyed them so much last time...but I think they forgot to put the scallop into the tiger roll (and the scallop is the best thing about that roll) and there was also a tiny sharp bone left in either the salmon or unagi. The fish bone has been stuck in my throat for 11 hours and counting now :( be careful! The food is still good, but my latest experience there unfortunately was not."}
{"text":"Great take out joint. They have a couple of small tables that could fit probably no more than 8 people.

We ordered the small platter that contained 3 rolls and some sushi pieces. We also ordered a white dragon roll.

Sushi was surprisingly fresh and the rolls are huge! The white dragon roll was yummy. 

The amount portion was great for 3 hungry people and the price is great for what you get. 

You can text them your order and they also deliver but cash only for delivery."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!! :) :) 
Never a disappointment when I order take out or even dine in there!  And to top it off, awesome service!! !! Definitely highly recommended.  White dragon and their spicy salmon is BOMB.COM!"}
{"text":"Cheap sushi but terrible quality. Ordered the Alaska roll, Caterpillar roll, salmon roll, and spicy salmon roll. The first two rolls were oversized and had no taste.

Likely won't order here again."}
{"text":"After getting a wrong order and returned to take the right one.my boyfriend found a long hair inside his mouth while he was eating one of the California rolls. Such a terrible experience"}
{"text":"Filling meal option when you're on the go. Good maki rolls that was average of $10 each...one roll is sufficient to satisfy one person. Taste is decent and worth coming back for more. Seatings are limited (seats 2 group at a time)."}
{"text":"This is like my go to restaurant for delivery... so today my boyfriend was like..where is the sushi place that you like? I was like I don't know because I only order delivery.. So finally today, I decided to go for pick up. It's a very small restaurant with two tables, so basically the seating around 8-10 settings. I was craving for sashimi, so I ordered the Sashimi Moriwase $19.99, I asked for more salmon. The salmon sashimi is always fresh and the butter fish was slightly torched. I always order the the white dragon roll-scallop on top then torched to spicy mayo, deep fried shrimp, avocado, cucumber, creamy crab meat $12.99 I really find torched sashimi brings out a good flavour ranging from sashimi to scallops and this roll is a good marriage.  I decided to try the black dragon roll $12.99 for a comprehensive black and white as I skipped lunch today. I prefer the white dragon roll because of the scallops. Totally worth a try! And if you hold parties,  good for delivery because it is free delivery over $20 before tax."}
{"text":"Located south of Yonge & Finch at Yonge & Byng, VIPS Sushi is a small sushi shop tucked away between several noodle places. Considered 1 of the 2 cheap/pick up and go sushi shops in the Yonge/Finch area with Sushi Bong being the other one. VIPS Sushi has a clean, easy to read menu where they offer lots of different types of rolls and popular Japanese dishes. While prices seem a bit much for sushi rolls, their portions at VIPS sushi are huge.

Food ****
I usually get their spicy Salmon roll and their white or green dragon roll. I have a pretty big appetite and ordering two rolls is enough for two meals. Their rolls also taste great and has a decent rice to fish ratio.

Service ****
Serves and chefs were always friendly and quick when I visit.

Ambiance ***
Place is small and not too fancy with only 2 tables for 4 people each available to eat at. This is definitely a pick up and go joint. Not much fancy decorations around. 

Tips/Closing comments
- More of a takeout sushi place rather than sit down
- Try their white dragon roll, scallop on top
- Order ahead so your order is ready when you get there, sometimes they get a bit busy during peak hours
- They let you have extra spicy mayo for free
- I choose this over Sushi Bong, both have huge portions but VIPS Sushi has a slightly higher price but with slightly higher quality"}
{"text":"Walked in for a late Friday afternoon lunch with a friend.

Ordered 2 rolls and they made the rolls within minutes! Shortest waiting time ever for sushi rolls :D

Got the Orange Dragon & Golden Ball Roll. These rolls are HUGE indeed. Fine quality ingredients. Definitely good value compared to other sushi places.

Service from all staff was pleasant and friendly. The owner lady I believe seems very nice as well; checking regularly if we are ok and need more tea.

Only 2 tables, so the ideal spot for dine-in lunch during busy hours. But I imagine this would definitely serve well as a take out go-to place for residents in the area.

Good rolls. Quick and friendly service. Great value. I would come here more regularly if I actually live around here."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food ... we are whitees and we loved it ... had the assorted sashimi and the lady in red ... fell in love with the lady in red and the assorted sashimi has amazing salmon and awesome white tuna ... highly recommended ...  great service as well ... but the place only has two tables so do not bring a date unless u have already been in her pants ... ;) ... or she is cool ..."}
{"text":"Roll quality rivals that of much more expensive restaurants... If I lived closer I'd be a regular here. I always get their torched rolls and they are consistently top notch!"}
{"text":"Actually a very good contender to the infamous Sushi Bong just a bit south.  They are a bit more expensive but their sushi has less rice and more of the good filling.

Their green dragon roll is good since they give a good amount of avocado.

I like their orange sauce they provide with their sushi."}
{"text":"Love VIPS! One of my go-to places for maki rolls. It's hidden on a side street along Yonge, a few blocks south of Finch. It's a small sushi joint with only 2 tables for sit-in but the bulk of their business is through take-out and delivery. 

The rolls are huge and every time I've been here, everything has always been fresh!  They pack on the ingredients so it's very filling. I'd recommend 2 rolls for 2 people; 3 would be pushing it. The rolls used be $7.99 but I think it's gone up to $9.99 now. Still pretty cheap and for what you're getting, can't complain.  

No charges for extra mayo is also a huge bonus.

As you read through the menu, you'll find that the rolls are all pretty similar but just topped with different things (i.e.: salmon, tuna, avocado, eel, etc.) So they'll end up tasting pretty similar. However, some of my favourites and must-trys are:

Lady in Red - Spicy crab meat over shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber. I've never been a fan of crab in my sushi so this one took a lot of convincing for me to try but it's amazing! All my friends love it. 

White Dragon - Blowtorched scallop over shrimp tempura, creamy crab meat, avocado and cucumber. Having aburi gives a little variety to the table. 

Tiger - Salmon on the top, scallop tempura, creamy crab meat, avocado and cucumber. One of the less sauce-y, cleaner-to-eat rolls. The scallop is awesome.

Sunset - Spicy salmon over shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber. I prefer this over their Spicy Salmon Crunch Roll because it isn't overpowered by tempura flakes."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and reliable sushi place. The sushi/sashimi combo prices look good but it's mostly salmon pieces. They don't seem to have too much variety of fish.  
Plan on calling in your order before you go there. They are super busy in the evening and you will be waiting at least 10 to 15 minutes for your order. 
Service is adequate and mediocre.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"high quality sushi for fair prices. very fast with their take-out orders."}
{"text":"From the outside, this restaurant didn't seem like much. There's only about two tables. I typically avoid these places. We ordered the lady in red and the rainbow dragon roll. The portions are quite large and they come with quite a bit of seafood. I enjoyed the Lady in Red, it was a good amount of spicy and the crispiness of the fried shrimp made it 10/10. The rainbow dragon roll had quite a bit of variety, but I definitely preferred the Lady in Red. Overall, it was pretty good service. We received our rolls quite promptly. It was also very filling at an affordable price. I was starving before I got there and left quite full."}
{"text":"Fairly new to the North York area and I was on the hunt for a sushi place. These guys came up on yelp, and I must say I was very satisfied with everything. The quality and size of the special rolls were definitely something I didn't expect (ordered 4 rolls) when the delivery man handed over the food I was surprised by the weight. Definitely will order from them in the future."}
{"text":"VIPs sushi is a small family run shop that has only 2 tables. When I arrived, both tables were filled but luckily, I only wanted take-out. They have a wide variety of rolls compared to other places and very quick to make my order so I can be on my way.

In terms of the roll that I got, it was just ok. Nothing special except it was big with 8 pieces. The cuts of the rolls were uneven but it was filling with lots of stuff like crab meat, unagi, cucumber and avocado. Definitely worth a try from time to time but not my go to place closeby."}
{"text":"Mainly a take-out spot with seating for like  6-8 people.  I always get the Torched Sushi (White Dragon and Black Dragon).  It's filling but expensive for what you get ($12.99 each plus tax).  The filling of the roll is pretty basic and the only raw fish is on the top (scallop or eel, although not raw) which is torched.  Pretty tasty but not good value if you really break it down.  There aren't many options in the area for decent quality sushi rolls so it's not a bad option if you want to stay in the area and grab quick takeout.  Definitely better than Sushi Bong which has a similar business model and is down the street."}
{"text":"For now, this place gets a 4.5 star review that for Yelp purposes gets rounded up to 5.

I think this place is going to be compared to Sushi Bong that is right around the corner and that is how I'll write this review as Sushi Bong seems to be the busiest in the Northtown condo district.

Even with a grand opening special and about a dozen of their rolls are 20% off, they are still a bit pricier than Sushi Bong. They also don't have meal combinations/specials so be prepared to pay a bit more.

They do have a variety of sushi pizzas that Sushi Bong does not have but they do not have udon noodles.

There are two key differentiators for me:
1. They have a larger variety of sushi rolls. Like Sushi Bong, you get a lot in your rolls.  To echo another user's review, the diameter is indeed comparable to that of an oreo cookie. 
2. You get more fillings in your roll.  It is isn't rice that makes it thicker. It's the avocado, the fish, or the cucumber that is adding to the size of the roll.

So... you spend a bit more (even with the grand opening special) but you get more for your dollar, as you're getting more ingredients instead of rice.

As far as the rolls themselves, the ingredients are very fresh and the completed product looks very appetizing. It's definitely a tasty product!

They're still new and I hope they stick to this formula... And even if they don't keep a dozen of their rolls on sale, it would be good to start to offer some kind of combination or have a few rolls on sale for the day or week.

Last but not least, there's free delivery if your order is over $20 and you can text your order which is pretty neat as with this day and age, who wants to make a phone call if they don't have to."}
{"text":"Black Dragon Roll (~$13)
Small hole in the wall, fits 8 people. More of a takeout place!

For 8 large pieces with avocado, fake crab meat, tempura shrimp. The eel was torched and was so creamy. The  mayo sauce on top had a really flavourful taste to it. 
There was a more spicy sauce on the side and I loved how it wasn't too spicy."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Toronto. Their rolls are quite large and worth the amount you pay for them. 

The only downside is that there is no place to sit, I really wish I was able to go there and enjoy it at a restaurant rather than having to take-out all the time. Also, the parking situation around there is horrible, even trying to stop to pick up the sushi is a hassle."}
{"text":"It's a very small joint a bit south of Finch Station. The staff are very kind and the rolls come out super fast! It's difficult to find places with value + quality fish but I was impressed. It's not a place for date night but for take out and dinner with your friends? This place is perfect."}
{"text":"Now I understand why people like this place so much. They only have a couple tables to sit down and eat (literally two of them) but their specialty rolls, Maki and sashimi are amazing. The seaweed is easy to bite through especially when those specialty rolls are a two-bitter. The sashimi is fresh and taste so good! After my dine-in experience I definitely grabbed their takeout menu and plan on ordering from here in the near future!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!! I love this place- fresh sushi, big portion sizes & by far the best customer service and not to mention great prices"}
{"text":"This tiny place has large specialty rolls, and they're delicious!
We always get 3 of their torched rolls: salmon, eel, and scallops.
What makes their rolls different is that they use a type of shredded crab filling. SO GOOD.
Every order comes with a little container of their spicy mayo, even without asking for it. That's a nice touch.
It's just off of Yonge St, on Byng Avenue, so finding parking can be tough; especially during peak hours.
There's a ZenQ just outside of VIPS Sushi, which is great for dessert.
The restaurant itself is designed for takeout orders, as there are only 2 or 3 small tables inside.

If you feel like sushi but don't want to spend a fortune, yet you don't want to go as cheap as Sushi Bong (also a great alternative), then VIPS Sushi may be right for you tonight!

Yes, I'd recommend VIPS Sushi to anyone and everyone (except for sushi snobs who only eat sushi from Japan, you know who you are)"}
{"text":"A ordered a large sashimi, sushi, maki combo, plus an alaska roll, a black dragon and 1 other roll, I forget the name, thinking that the rolls included in the combo would be the generic stuff like cucumber rolls or tuna rolls. I was very impressed to find very specialty rolls in the combo, one being something similar to a Philadelphia roll and another spicy crunchy roll, it's a mystery to me. 

It was all very tasty and it fed 8 people to the brink of a siesta.

Delivery was punctual. I pre-ordered hours ahead. The delivery person was very nice and surprised about the tip. Maybe people don't tip delivery people very much, but with any good service, a good tip is the least that I can do. I love their free delivery after $20 purchase offer.

Looking forward to trying out other tasty sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I'd say this joint has the best value and one of the best taste in the price bracket.

The sushi is alright and doesn't feel as miserably awful to the degree of bento box sushi, but it's sold at a pricepoint that's roughly 1 - 2x the price, and if you consider the fact that one will irrevocably ruin your day and this one can actually save your day, it really shines some perspective.

I've tried most of the rolls and some of the nigiri. The roll game is pretty tight and nigiri game will definitely match up to higher price bracket restaraunts (excluding $100+ per person).

Recommendable.

{"text":"I got spicy crunchy salmon and volcano for takeout. The inside was tiny so dine-in was not really meant to be an option any way.

The rolls were huge, and it did taste very crunchy. They also gave spicy mayo dippings, which is my favorite."}
{"text":"Fresh, huge and diverse rolls! Really great selections and you can't go wrong with any of them. Wish they put some fish in the rolls tho. Sometimes lacking in that department. 
The rolls are huge and the spicy mayo on the side is amazing! Text to order is also a fantastic bonus!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 2 times and love this place! The sushi is fresh and tasty! They're not on ubereats but if you call the store they deliver fast."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here dozens of times: delivery (through JustEat), take-out and sit-down. The food has been superb every time. The miso is great for its price, the tempura is always fresh and not too greasy which nicely sized shrimp and big pieces of yams. The sashimi is very fresh, with the salmon and especially the white tuna (served with lemon) being very delicious. The sushi and the special rolls are fantastic too. Of note is their black dragon roll, tempura roll, and volcano roll. The black dragon has eel placed on top, drizzled with spicy Mayo and sweet soy sauce, then torched. The tempura roll meanwhile is kinda like a dynamite roll that's then lightly dipped in tempura and fried."}
{"text":"Been at VIPS. Few times and every time the food have been consistently good, great service."}
{"text":"Great takeout sushi place in North York. The rolls are tasty and are big, so if you're just looking for some fast simple takeout sushi for a good price, this is the place for you. 

All the rolls are very good and interesting. My fav are the dynamite, rainbow and rainbow dragon (combination of a dynamite and rainbow). 

Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and was craving some sushi so I checked to see what was close by... VIPS sushi came up and had pretty good reviews so I said why not. 
Holy smokes, was I Blown Away by the incredible flavor and freshness of the sushi!

The waiter was super helpful in helping me to decide what I should order and recommended I get the white dragon roll and spicy salmon! Literally the best decision I've made all day.

 The portions are huge and the price point is right On target! I don't know if I should be happy that I found this place or upset because I'm definitely going to be spending alot of my time here...

If you're roaming around Yonge Street and looking something to eat I would highly recommend you check this place out! 

You may even see me there...

5 stars for freshness and service!!"}
{"text":"This inconspicuous sushi joint is good, really good. Offering takeout and dine-in I prefer to cozy up to one of the two the tables and enjoy my sushi coma that's about to ensue.
Don't miss the hot torched tataki rolls mkay!"}
{"text":"Came here several times for take out and i believe its time they have earned my review. 

5/5 stars in the $-$$ category. The rolls are very generous and tastes great. The spicy mayo that comes with the roll is what separates this sushi bar with many other places. 

The biggest difference between VIP sushi and Sushi bong nearby is that the lady serving at VIP sushi is exceptionally polite, sweet and appreciated the business. The lady at sushi bong however acts like shes doing you a favour for selling you sushi. 

keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is a local takeout joint that offers two or three tables for eat in customers. The menu here specializes in rolls and the rolls here are HUGE. Seriously I made the mistake of ordering two rolls and I was only able to finish one because it's about double the size of other places. The rolls were very tasty. Try any of the dragon rolls. They're my go to."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Rolls aplenty! Large portions!

VIPS Sushi is probably the best restaurant in Uptown to order bulk rolls for low prices. Don't expect too much on quality here; if you do you'll be disappointed. The rolls are huge and are made faster than fast food.

Most people order take out in this restaurant, but there are two tables available for dining in. If you dine in, you will get a free cup of green tea with your order. They also artistically design your rolls compared to your typical styrofoam takeout containers. Did I mention the sushi chefs are extremely nice and will acknowledge you entering and leaving?

When I had lunch today I noticed they had a \"opening special\" where most of the special rolls were $2 off. I wasn't sure if it was the fact I arrived in the first hour or if it's a \"grand opening\" special...despite the fact the place has been open for a good 9 months! So my order ended up costing only $7.99 + tax.

I ordered the red spark roll, as I wanted a roll that has some form of avocado and tobiko. For $7.99 these rolls were simply excellent. Of course I've had much better, for example avocado that actually melted in your mouth and had taste, but everything else the quality was comparable to some of the lunch specials I've had in pretty much any Korean-run sushi restaurant.

If I want a quick bite or take-out and am craving for rolls instead of sushi, I would definitely come here."}
{"text":"I give this place 2.5 stars!

This is one of a couple of small sushi joints in the neighbourhood. I decided to try this place because it is close to home and I wanted to try something different other than Sushi Bong. Unfortunately, the quality of the rolls wasn't very good and they have a lot of their spicy hot sauce lying around their restaurant, which makes me believe that their secret ingredient to most of their rolls is their spicy mayo. The dynamite roll was very different from other dynamite rolls I've had and it was filled with a LOT of shredded fake crab meat that was drenched in the spicy mayo sauce. It wasn't very appetizing that's for sure. The crab meat also didn't seem very fresh.

The atmosphere was like a takeout sushi place. It seats a handful of customers at 2-3 tables, so it's a very small restaurant. 

The prices of the rolls are also on the more expensive side compared to other places near by.

Unfortunately, they also got my order wrong. I asked for a yam tempura roll (and repeated a couple of times), but they ended up giving me a bunch of yam tempura instead.

I'm not sure I'll return since there is a better takeout sushi place just down the street."}
{"text":"Rolls are pretty decent and ingredients are fresh.  Definitely not anywhere near authentic but tasty for sure.

For the price they are a good value, but still solidly at an A-OK.

Note: they do not accept credit cards (despite what it says on Yelp and the fact that you can pay for it via credit card through just-eat.ca)."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi rolls at a reasonable price. Located on a small street on Yonge, VIPS Sushi definitely doesn't look visually appealing -- but it's a cheap sushi takeout joint, and it definitely does that well. We came in on a Friday evening for takeout, but ended eating in. There are two small tables, which can seat 4 people each, so don't really plan on eating in at VIPS, it's very much a takeout joint. I found pricing reasonable. The White Dragon roll was my favourite. 

Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I should probably try it again, but likely won't. With Sushi Bong close by, I'm sticking to that as my go-to place for large pieces of sushi for cheap prices and so-so quality. If not for their competitor, I would have given this place 3 stars. 

Perhaps it's the rolls I ordered (sunset roll, lady in red), but I felt they added too much sauce and just ruined the taste. Also ordered the regular sushi combo but did not find it anything special. Not a great sushi experience.

2.5 stars out of 5.

{"text":"4.5

Having been a loyal Bong Sushi customer for so long, it was hard to believe there was a sushi place near Yonge and Finch that could pry me away.  VIPs is now my go to place for sushi in the area.

Pros:
Rolls are all very big and very well done
Great prices
Friendly staff

Cons:
Not much seating

I'm starting to really love this place.  I've been going a few times the last 2 months and I'm now completely sold on it.  All the special rolls have the opening special price of $7.99 (I'm starting to think it's a permanent special at this point).  You get your money's worth.  The rolls are all long and large (that's what she said) and one will probably fill up most appetites. I was a fan of Bong because of value and this place matches that if not more.  I only wish my fav Black Dragon roll was $7.99.   It's the only special roll that doesn't seem to be $7.99.  Boo..  C'est la vie.

The staff are always nice whenever I come by.  There seems to be a rotation on who comes in but the head chef seems to be there everyday.  He's very nice and goes about business and usual.  I've never had a problem whatsoever with service.  I've started to get delivery from them and the driver is pretty cool too.

Speaking of delivery, it's free with a $20 before taxes order.  You can even text for delivery now.  Just send a detailed text to them with your order and they will send a confirmation one back to you.  So simple!!  I can simply text on my way home and within minutes it will be at my door.  Gluttony made easier!!  Lovely!

So yeah, if you're looking for a sit down meal it will get tricky.  There are only 2 tables there and they are in the same area as where people will wait for their pick up and to go orders.  It won't be ambient at all to say the least.

All in all, this is my new fav sushi place at Yonge and Finch.  I recommend everyone around the area give it a try."}
{"text":"Went to get takeout a few times, like their rolls with spicy mayo. But last week I went to pick up my order, one of the sushi chef worked as cashier, after he took cash from me, he went straight back to sushi making, WITHOUT washing his hands! It's so disgusting, never going back."}
{"text":"TLDR: An easily overlooked Underrated sushi place to make your next favourite.
Quality - 5/5
Quantity - 5/5
Value - 5/5
Service - 5/5
The good:
-The special rolls (7.99) are all quite large. I eat a lot and I can only eat one roll before I am satisfied, one and a half to full.
-The price for the amount of food you receive is very reasonable and they, as other reviewers have said, are packed with ingredients. 
-The sushi pizza are also quite good, they come with a very generous portion on the top of them, but don't order unless you like deep fried.
-Their sauces are great, they will provide soy sauce at request, they are always very friendly and punctual with the times they give you for food being ready. (Max wait time 20min only once, usually 5-10).
-Personal favourite at this time is the Caterpillar roll, heaping with avocado, have ordered it a dozen times and every time it is refreshing. Cool avocado against a slightly warm centre makes for a great experience.
The bad:
-Not really bad, they just are space limited. Seats about six, generally you can get a spot."}
{"text":"Delicious and cozy. I'm not sure why but the quality seemed to have changed recently and I was compelled to review. In general, I give sushi restaurants a 3/5 if they're moderate quality and service. 4/5 stars if they're cheaper and delicious with good service. Once in a while I give a 5/5 for good service, good price, and generally great experience. There are a lot of good sushi places around town and this one is NOT one of the best tasting, but it's got something special.

The portions for one, are large. The seating is tiny. but the hearts are huge! The staff here are lovely. Great people! It feels like a friend is making you sushi in their home. 

Honestly, if the taste was a bit better I'd give the place a 5. If the hearts were a little smaller I'd give this place a 3. Give it a try. fyi Take out does not have as much heart. Take out or ritual probably a good 3/5."}
{"text":"Awesome place for takeout when you're craving some sushi! Although a bit more expensive than Sushi Bong, it's still quite affordable and worth it. We called for pickup around lunch time and they said it would be ready in 5-10 min. Tried the Salmon Tataki roll (torched) and loved it! Generous amount of creamy crabmeat filling with a thin layer of rice on the outside."}
{"text":"It's a very small space with 2 tables. Last time I came here there were no spots so it's a good spot for takeout but not sit in. 

Got 3 rolls for 2 people... 2 rolls would've been enough but... Gluttony. The rolls are pretty massive just like Sushi Bong but better in taste and quality but more expensive

Sunset Roll - Spicy Salmon 7/10 - lots of salmon on the top but the presentation isn't very appealing

Rainbow Roll - 7/10 - decent sized sashimi on top of the roll from side to side which is nice 

White Dragon - Torched Scallop - 9/10 - this was my favourite! Must try."}
{"text":"don't forget to try the variety of flame cooked  rolls that are done right before your eyes at the risk of getting your eyelashes  burnt. :)

Tried cheating on VIP sushi with other sushi establishments when I moved into the neighborhood. 9 months later.. totally have repented  from my cheating ways. I will never stray again.. just will try to stretch my mouth wide enough to fit my gorgeously \"HUGE\"  fresh rolls. You  try them you will not be dissappointed.  Try the dynamite roll.. ask for rice on the outside.  Try the sunset..  its a dynamite roll with  spicy salmon on top.. and don't forget to try the variety of flame cooked  rolls that are done right before your eyes at the risk of getting your eyelashes  burnt. :)"}

But I like how they have just the right amount of sauce in their rolls."}

{"text":"Another giant sushi place! This place torches some of their rolls and they are so yummy! Seating is limited as they only have one table so we always get takeout from here. Our favorite rolls include the White and Black dragons, Kamikazi roll, Alaska roll. I've tried everything that is torched on their menu and they are always on point!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great price, great portion, great service. Too bad it doesn't deliver in my area. Worth the drive though! My favourite is the Golden Dragon."}
{"text":"Like other yelpers, I have been a loyal customer at Sushi Bong (another value-town sushi place at yonge/finch) for the longest time. Ever since VIPS opened, I never went back to Sushi Bong. VIPS sushi is amazing if you want budget AND huge sushi.  Their White Dragon Roll is absolutely amazing (blow-torched scallop sashimi on top of a regular dragon roll)... And their spicy mayo is always free of charge unlike other sushi places in the area. They are really quick, service is amazing. However, they only have 2 small dinning tables in the shop, so I would recommend take-out or delivery. 

P.S. They don't accept credit cards, so bring your debit/cash!

{"text":"Delivery was faster than predicted by Just Eat! Sashimi deserves 4 stars for the portion size and taste. I'm not sure why the salmon colour is inconsistent for the philadelphia roll. There's something fishy about the brown parts. hmm... I've never had pickles in a sushi roll before, but it was a good combination with the Philadelphia cheese and salmon. The sunrise roll wasn't particularly special, but the sizes are big and that deserves 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I really like their massive rolls and their unique rolls. I think it's really good for the price. I love how they put a lot of fish inside each roll. My favourite is the Tiger Roll. However, there's creamy (imitation) crab salad is in most rolls so if you're not a fan of that, it might not be your thing."}
{"text":"Good food, huge proportion, friendly staff and very very fast. You can order by text message."}
{"text":"Ordered the sushi and maki combo. They give you a variety of tasty, yet thinly cut sushi. The maki roll however, was huge. All the pieces were delicious, but I'd definitely come back for just the rolls. The sushi tasted good but the better value is in the maki."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 rolls they look very tasty however the ingredients weren't stick together properly and they were not cut perfectly , keep falling apart ."}
{"text":"If you are seeking authentic makizushi, VIPS Sushi is most likely not the place for you. However, if you are seeking generous portion-sized maki, VIPS is the motherland of ginormous maki. Unless your mouth is the size of Paul Frank, it is virtually impossible for you to finish the maki in a single bite. The best part of these sushi is the rice to ingredients ratio. 

Crispy Tuna Crunch ($7.99)
Flavorful, crisp, fresh, spicy...just the way I like it. 

Black Dragon (torched eel with salad crab and tempura shrimp) ($12.99)
The fire torched escalated the flavor profile of barbeque eel and Japanese mayo. The chew of the rice, the crispiness of the shrimp, the tenderness of the salad crab, and the softness of the avocado, all complimented the texture the roll. The flavors intertwine into a truly orgasmic experience. 

Each roll is beautifully crafted by attractive Korean chefs with impeccable skin.  If inauthentic sushi is a crime, then VIPS is convicted of being too generous with fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I constantly order from here and only ONCE have we ever had a mediocre experience. I would say this place is CONSISTENT. Normally, I find, when places open up the food is amazing and then over time the quality begins to suffer - not VIPS.

Delivery is always quick and when we order to pick up the food is usually ready by the time we arrive. Everyone is incredibly friendly, especially the delivery man :)

The rolls are generously sized and filled with all the \"fixings\". I'm not a huge fan of the crab and to my surprise they always end up giving more avocado. As well, for each roll that we order there is always a container of spicy mayo waiting for us.

The ingredients are fresh and taste wonderful, by far one of the best sushi I have had in the city, especially for their price points... can't complain over $7.99 rolls!"}

Two teeny tables but we snagged one and had the loveliest waitress, service was impeccable & food is sooo delicious!

We had three rolls, one thing is reviews are accurate when they say they are HUGE! Fresh fish & delicious spicy mayo. 

Went back today for a lunch take-out, was once again NOT disappointed.

It's a must try for sure!"}

I recommend VIP if you get tired of sushi bong and want a little heat in your rolls. The sizes are relatively the same and the quality has stayed consistent."}

Very delicious sushi and I will definitely order again, the only thing I hope to see from them is to add combination roll deals."}

I got their sunrise roll (dragon roll with spicy salmon on top) and it wasn't as good as the spicy salmon crunch roll in my opinion. This place isn't going to break records for their fresh fish or for anything that different.. But if your looking for a place to get a yummy roll for 7.99, I'd say this place deserves a chance."}

I order from here quite regularly and I enjoy my meals every time. Food quality is fresh and fantastic. Staff are very pleasant and welcoming.

I almost don't want to say how good this place is because I'm afraid that this little gem will be spoiled by the masses. 

Although I live less than 100 yards away, I'm lazy and pay for delivery. They are fast and efficient and never late!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 

I had never tried this place before, but I decided to order from this place for a company lunch after considering the Yelp reviews and price. I texted them the details a few days beforehand, then afterwards I had to make some changes to the order, they responded very quickly, gave me no fuss at all. Food was delivered right on time, and like everyone said, the delivery guy was extremely nice.

I wish I could take some pictures of all the food I ordered, but everyone was already too excited and started digging in right away. I only tried the sushi, so I can only comment on that. In general, the portion sizes were generous, they don't just stuff you with rice like a lot of the cheaper places, they stuff you with the fillings. I personally liked the spicy salmon maki a lot. All in all, everyone was happy with both the quantity and the quality. 

I would highly recommend this place :)"}
