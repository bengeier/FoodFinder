{"text":"A lot of fish and chips places either do not seem to use the freshest fish or get the batter wrong, these folks do fish and batter right, nothing frozen fish tasting here and the batter is excellent.  Granted it is not your typically appearing fish and chips, but taste is what matters and taste is great here."}
{"text":"It is cheap.   But I got what I paid for.

I was having a flashback craving for Sullivans and tried here as a back up.   Not good.  

The fish squares were very fishy tasting even doused with their pink sauce.   Silly me asked if they had malt vinegar - no luck"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Fish and Chips are awesome. Pete's has their own special sauce that is not tarter sauce- that is so good! The sauce is made fresh daily and the locals buy extra sauce to take home. Prices are good and service is fast."}
{"text":"I don't understand how people can eat here. It's dry, it's bland, it's not appealing to my taste buds. I order the super seafood combo which included 2 pieces of fish, and 7 shrimps with fries. Honestly took a few bites of everything, I hate wasting food but however my stomach started acting up. I was slightly irritated that they charged for tarter sauce but gave me a ton of that red sauce which was gross. This place deserves 0 stars to be honest. I didn't think one could mess up frying fish but apparently they can. To be honest, better luck with Long John Silvers. I am still suffering from the food I ate but hopefully it'll pass."}
{"text":"Now a lot of local residents will exclaim, \"Pete's Fish and Chips is the BEST!\" but I will have to markedly DISAGREE.  It is one of the ONLY fish restaurants in the area but honestly you are better off with a chain like Red Lobster than going here.  

Originally from Southern California, I was craving fish after moving to Arizona so I asked colleagues where to find good fish. They recommended Pete's.  I ordered a TON of food in anticipation.  I was disappointed with everything I ordered.  Does NOT taste fresh, breading is HORRIBLE and you need hot sauce to cover up the fishy taste and flavor of what they serve. Extremely disappointed.

If you've lived in the desert your ENTIRE life and never ventured elsewhere or really don't know what fresh fish is MAYBE(highly doubtful) you will enjoy Pete's. If you are from the coast, don't waste your money! 

Oh, and if you go, bring CASH.  They don't take debit cards because....hmmmm.mmmm...actually I can't think of a reason?  Oh wait! I think they make money off you using their cash machine...SWEET!(for them)."}
{"text":"What can I say about Pete's that most valley residents don't already know? We don't have a lot of fish joints out here in the desert, but Pete's has been around a long time, serving up some of the best fish and chips you'll find out here. You can get tasty, plentiful meals for very cheap, and their sauce goes well with just about everything. What's not to love?

The only thing I can say about this location is it can get quite busy and seating is limited, so that can sometimes be an issue. Plus, it's outdoors like most Pete's are, so it can be miserable in the Summer, even with the misters. They do not take any form of payment other than cash, so if you're carrying plastic, you're out of luck. Staff are not always that pleasant at this location either, I've noticed, but the good food seems to make up for that. I've been going here for years and plan to keep going for many to come!"}
{"text":"There are always lines around the drive thru for this place, so I finally got to try it. Bulk made processed fish squares, limp fries, and watered down ketchup mixed with some kind of sweet n sour sauce. It seems die hard locals love this crap. Long John Silvers is better, sadly. What absolute disappointing trash."}
{"text":"We had heard so many good things about this restaurant, so we had to try it. This place was a major let down. Coming from New England, we were accustomed to fresh seafood. This place serves nothing but frozen seafood. We had fish, scallops, shrimp and crabettes. Nothing had any flavor at all. Very bland. The prices are reasonable and now I see why. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"My friend's daughter asked if there are any fast food places that are only in Arizona?  They  mentioned a few and I told them we have those in Texas too.  Pete's Fish and Chips was mentioned as an original.  We happened to drive by one on the way back to the house.  Today I decided to walk the few intersections down to Pete's.  It all was downhill from there.  There was a line so I had plenty of time to review the menu.  The main thing I wanted to try was the fish, only one piece came in the #1 combo along with shrimp, fries, and a drink and one sauce.  At this point I'm curious about what the sauce is and notice the sign offers a tart and pink sauce as well.  I opted for the #2 Seafood combo since it included two fish and three sauces.  

The guy at the counter was abrupt with the order.  He was peering out from a dark screen and could barely hear him to notice he was talking to me.  I asked for a bottled water as the drink - he asked if I wanted just a plain cup of water (bottled water was priced less than the 32 oz drink on the menu so I thought I could at least get that).  I just agreed and moved on.  No asking what kind of sauce or offering anything else.  The food was ready relatively quickly, I barely got my hand out of the window as I reached for salt and pepper before it was slammed shut again.  When I sat down and opened up the deli paper covered platter I was a bit taken aback.  Two squares of obviously frozen fish product and nine prepared frozen shrimp.  This looked like something from a food service supplier - except I've used Sysco's fried shrimp and they are infinitely better.  The \"sauce\" turned out to be watered down ketchup with perhaps a splash of white vinegar.  The fish and shrimp had no real flavor and way to much breading.  Not awful, but the Ultimate Fish Sticks from Costco heated in my toaster oven far surpassed this supposedly famous fish.  The fries were ok, and perhaps the only thing that seemed homemade.  

I managed to eat most of all the platter before I ran out of sauce.  I wished I had tartar sauce and cocktail sauce AND that I had gone to Long John Silver's instead.  LJS blows Pete's out of the water.  I had to stop by McDonald's on the way back to get an apple pie to get the taste of Pete's out of my mouth.  Overall, I give Pete's a \"D\" for disgusting."}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp and chips combo with 2 pieces of fish on the side! The shrimp was amazing and crispy, but a little too salty. The fries, like the shrimp, were very salty but still good! The sauce is definitely the star of the show. It's like a spicy cocktail sauce that tasted great on anything I ordered! Will I go back? Probably for the shrimp!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pete's since I was a kid.  I always loved the shrimp. In the last year or so they changed the batter. It's a cornmeal slurry.  It's just gross now. I'm forced to go to Knock Kneed Lobster now to get my shrimp and chips, then drive to Pete's to get my sauce. Truth!!  Their sauce still rocks. PLEASE CHANGE THE BATTER ON YOUR SHRIMP!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a Mesa staple!!! We love it. Burritos and onion rings are a must order! The Petes sauce is spicy and tangy--Better than fry sauce! This place has nostalgia and personality. The workers are friendly and the soda mixes are perfection!! Messy fish sandwich all the way!!"}
{"text":"The shrimp are great, but the best part is definitely the Pete's sauce.  I don't particularly like fried fish so I've never had any.

It's been mentioned numerous times, but the  seating really leaves a lot to be desired - drive thru is the way to go!

The only problem I have is leaving my refillable soda cup at home :("}
{"text":"I don't know if they're putting crack in the the shrimp, but just thinking about it makes my mouth water. And even thought he \"Pete sauce\" is a fairly easy mystery to solve and make on my own, I always order extra because I ALWAYS run out.

The one thing I've got to say is germaphobes should just hit up the drive through - one word: pigeons."}
{"text":"Quite simply the worst fish and chips I have ever had the displeasure of eating. Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register. It's like they combed the state of Arizona and recruited only the worst of the worst. I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?! I guess if McDonald's can do it with fish filets, anyone can do it. I utterly hate McDonald's and i would choose easing a fish filet from there, then eating this crap every again. Boo to you I say. BOO TO YOU"}
{"text":"Went here today to get a number 2 (shrimp fries and a piece of fish) with a Sierra Mist luckily before walking away with my order I checked my drink which turned out to be nasty tap water, went back to exchange it and the lady at the window was nice about it. Then I get home and I'm missing all of my shrimp from my number 2 at that point I said whatever too hungry to go back. So I finished my meal and here I am a couple of hours later vomiting cramping and with a headache. Do not eat here you're better off going to long john silvers."}
{"text":"First sign of I should have left was no credit card machine. But they do have an ATM they charge you to $2.50 cents to use. Second I ordered the fish and chips and had to pay 55 cents for tartar sauce, I thought tarter sauce should come with a fish n chips meal. All in all very shady charges for a meal not very good. I will not eat here again and I Will tell my friends not to either."}
{"text":"Nasty, tasteless nuggets of over-fried batter. Even Long John Silvers is better than this dump. Of course if you're a drunk college student you may enjoy this after a night at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some coworkers today. Hadn't been to one of the locations since I was at the Indian School location 10 years ago. I recall not being impressed back then and nothings changed. Probably worse than I remembered. Got the shrimp and chips today. The shrimp are a joke. They take a single shrimp and butterfly it and then slice it again, then roll it in this horrible corn meal batter a few times to make it look bigger. So basically their 10 piece shrimp is 2.5 shrimp divied up. No flavor whatsoever either. They give you a small ramekin with what they call special sauce. Just watery ketchup with some slightly hot el patio sauce. I guess the fries were ok but ended up eating most of them plain because the provided sauce ran out halfway thru the platter. 
Oh yeah two other things to consider. Make sure you use the restroom before you get here as they don't have one. Awesome and thoughtful that a place that serves food you eat with your fingers doesn't provide a place to wash them first. So if your hands are dirty, oh well!!! Hell, maybe that'll add some flavor to this horseshit. 
Other thing is, its cash only. Why this is still a thing beats me. I can buy a breakfast burrito via card from a dude at the farmers market in the park under a pop-up canopy, but not here! But its cool because they WERE thoughtful enough to put an ATM by the order window. That charges 2 dollars and 50 cents per transaction. Sweeeeeeet.
Staff was ok, standard except for a large rude woman but I've already written enough to start in on her. 
Next time I want a plate of fried stuff I will just do the fair. It blows this place away."}
{"text":"Thank you God for listening, Pete's Fish &  Chips finally  closed at this location. This food was so nasty. I got sick to my stomach. This place was so bad, I swear  I wanted to construct  a picket sign and stand out front.  All the bad reviews  on this place I agree with. Frozen fish filets pre-packed French fries.  How dear you call this a restaurant. Who gave these people  a loan to start this  business,  cause I need to talk to them. Please Shut all of these places down. Gross  beyond gross. Nastiest food ever."}
{"text":"Has to be the WORST fish and chips I have ever eaten.Was in town with some friends and we thought we would try it. CRAP! Can't say anything good about the place. How people love it or how it has stayed in business for so long is beyond me. Frozen right out of the box. Fish is horrible. Shrimp is barely palatable.I'm done, don't want to waste any more time on this place!!!"}
{"text":"Straight from Wal-Mart to your plate.  

This was the most disappointing meal I've had in ages.  I watched the staff pull retail boxes of breadded fish from a freezer in the middle of the kitchen and serve them up.  

The portions were adequate, but not outsanding.

Throughout my 20+ years in the Valley I've heard Pete's was a great fish-n-chips place, but yikes!   Looks like i'm stuck with LJS for my fish and chips fix.

I'll never visit again."}
{"text":"I remember an old Will and Grace episode where karen is wearing a disguise and eating at a taco shack.  This is how I feel about Pete's.  

It has been in business and the hearts of phoenicians since 1947.  It is my guilty pleasure.  This particular location is just a short drive down Central from my House.  

I agree with the yelpers review about ambience.  Lets hope you like bird watching because ALL pete's locations are strictly outdoor seating.  The food is great.  Deep fried goodness!

They have an amazing sauce that goes well with everything.  Part Ketchup, Part hot sauce.  Simply amazing.

Cash Only!!!!

See you there!"}
{"text":"How can they call this fish n chips without malt vinegar!  No hot sauce!  Wha!? Shrimp was 90% batter. Instead of fish, fish patties.  Someone please explain to me how so many are eating here. I can truly appreciate my own fish n chips place back at home."}
{"text":"Wow from a frozen box this place is gross. The red sauce taste like Lucas the stuff you get off the ice cream trucks for fruit and the fish Gorton's fisherman fish sticks like what you used to get in the 80s for lunch I bite says it all GROSS maybe if I was 6 years old but I'm not I wasted good money on this place don't do the same. SO LET'S BREAK IT DOWN..Frozon fish sticks.GROSS.Red Sauce.GROSS.KEEP YOUR MONEY INSTEAD. HAPPY"}
{"text":"I can't fathom why this place is so popular. This place literally sells froze food from the grocery store thrown into the deep fryer. Exactly like the fish shrimp burritos and corn dogs you buy at Walmart literally thrown into the deep fryer. Fish and chips I think not. If you like real food steer clear from this."}
{"text":"Gotta love Petes. Only complaints at this location is the shrimp. I hate the log skinny pieces instead of the whole shrimps like Mesa Dr! Also the extra cup sauces seem like they have more ketchup than the ones you get with the meal. But that could just be me trippin. IDK. LOL!"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible! I absolutely love their food but their service is unbelievable; they served us at about 10 minutes before they closed in paper plates (nothing that is able to be taken to go) and had the nerve to ask us to leave so they can SPRAY the table. REAAAAALLY! Like there is nothing else to do RIGHT when they close. May I mind you this place is outside. After we respond \"can you give us five minutes to eat\" he say \"well we're kinda closing\""}
{"text":"Nice customer service but that's it. 

Worst fish and chips I have ever had. And their Pete's sauce sucks hard. Seriously please don't ever eat here. I have stomach ache."}
{"text":"Best fried/fast seafood spot in AZ. They don't try to compare themselves to ritzy fresh seafood joints. You are getting what you pay for.. A yummy cheap seafood grease party in your mouth. Huge fan of the fried shrimp and cocktail sauce. I would recommend eating your food there as take out orders don't taste the same after the drive home. I've read some of these other reviews, these folks are just missing the concept. As for all the million cars in the drive thru and long lines at the window.. These people get it and for some reason don't write reviews. I just wish you all would open one in the north valley!"}
{"text":"I don't trust any type of fish in the desert so I opted for the chicken nuggets and a chicken breast sandwich. The sandwich was very crunchy and the nuggets were nothing special. the sauce is similar to a sweetened tabasco sauce. If I had a choice I would choose chik-fil-a over Pete's any day of the week."}
{"text":"Nastiest food EVER!!! dont even waste your time or money! Was frozen Vandekemps!  Couldve have brought better in the frozen food section!!!!!!!!What a joke....Cant even call it fish & chips!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. I have passed by Pete's hundreds of times and never stopped because I rarely carry cash and they don't take plastic. I just happened to have cash on me and time to kill today so I stopped in for lunch. I ordered the #1 combo. It was almost 8 bucks for 4 pieces of shrimp, 1 fishy patty, soggy fries and a large soda. The shrimp was decent, they were pretty big. The fish patty was not very good. The meal was served with a red sauce which I believe was watered down cocktail sauce. Although the shrimp was pretty good, nothing else I had was. I won't bother going back. Do yourself a favor, go to the grocery store and buy some fish sticks instead. They'll taste better than Pete's fishy patty.  Pretty disappointed with Pete."}
{"text":"\"Eh\" would be the one word I'd choose to describe it. 

One immediate downside is that the place is cash only. As someone who almost never carries cash, it took me months before I was able to try this place.

Seating is outdoors with a view of the light rail construction.  Eating there and not to-go was a bit of a bummer because there were tons of flies zipping around us and our food. 

My partner tried the fish and chips. The fish, he said, tasted like average fish sticks that you'd buy from a grocery store. I tried the fries; they were pretty underwhelming, but eatable. I ordered the burger. It wasn't very flavorful, but it did its job to make me full. I've eaten better burgers elsewhere that were cheaper, though. 

Would I eat here again? Ehhhhhh."}
{"text":"Don't do it.... I'm in the parking lot right now and am actually throwing out the food I just got at the drive in after taking one bite of the \"shrimp\" and fish \"square\"."}
{"text":"Some co-workers went and brought a meal for me for lunch. What inspired this? We encountered one of the owners who loudly and obnoxiously proclaimed that Pete's Fish & Chips was the best ever, while sporting the t-shirt, at a random encounter at our work. They said once I try it, I will agree and that Pirates Fish & Chips stole their secret sauce recipe. This came after the person nearly chewed my face off for saying I have a favorite fish place out of state that has never been beat, in my book. They actually tried to start an argument with me. I tried it- did not like it. I feel like this person didn't know that fish doesn't naturally come in a square. It was very bland and I've had more excitement with frozen fish sticks. I felt even more disappointed because I was put under the impression that this was supposed to be amazing. It fell really short of it."}
{"text":"So bad I don't even know where to start.  Read all the other reviews and you'll get the idea."}
{"text":"The employees are definitely nicer than the Pete's in South Phoenix but I would rather deal with the mean and tatted up old lady in South Phoenix than getting under breaded and under cooked onion rings. The burrito was excellent and they give you more sauce than usual in this location though."}
{"text":"Pete's is a love it or hate it place hands down and if you have grown up in the valley you are way more likely to love the fried everything with a side grease menu. If you are looking for anything else other than that you have come to the wrong place."}
{"text":"Fish chips are delicious..  Everything is deep fry.. It is cheap and interesting.. But the environment is not good..  People only can eat at outside."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!
CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!
NO ONION RINGS OR CHICKEN STRIPS ON FRIDAYS!
Been going here for 30 year I love this place
outside dining only
Get the Seafood combo to try the shrimp and fish!
Messy Fish sandwich is great too!"}
{"text":"Yeah really not that good I don't like Square fish patties kind of suck Fry's were good though"}
{"text":"My husband and Mother went to this location tonight. The drive through took a very long time. They ordered a burger and 4 meals. When checking our order my husband saw that an order of shrimp was missing.  My husband parked the car and went to the window to ask for the missing order. The man did not believe my husband. He argued with him and said that he personally packed the order and everything was included. He followed him to the car , took everything out of the bag and placed it on the seat and then checked my husbands receipt. He obviously thought my husband was lying. After seeing that the order was missing he gave a quick apology and went to get the missing food. 
When they got home the food was only warm. The shrimp and fish are so heavily breaded you can't taste anything else. It's dry and the French fries are soggy. 
I will never go to this location again. The customer service is horrible and the food is terrible."}
{"text":"Hands down five stars! You've got to try this local place if you're in downtown Mesa. My family has come here since I was a kid"}
{"text":"Sauce 5 star , Food -4 All about quantity not quality,
This Was a all time favorite at one time
What happen ?  Big shrimp ( all batter) Fries frozen, bla  Fish ( minced )
Sad how the young generation of this family owed business change the quality standards"}
{"text":"The worst petes I had ever had since I've been going to this location. I'm from Mesa and used to love this place, but the drive from my now home in Scottsdale was not worth it all. The \"chips\" were so tasteless and dry with nothing but hard bits included. The shrimp was dry as well and had a stale taste to it. The last time I made a trip to this location, same thing except I just thought I would give it another try. Nope. Not again. Pirates fish and chips is my new go-to fast food seafood fix."}
{"text":"i love pete's fish and chips. staff is always friendly and helpful. food is great. This location is always super busy. Shrimp is great and so are the burgers."}
{"text":"Mesa icon, fantastic fried food, great value, fast service. The sauce is the best - don't forget to order extra. Love the fish squares and tasty fries. Their monster burger is delicious. Pete's is to Mesa as Dick's Drive In is to Seattle, but I like Pete's better (both take cash only too)."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this fish and chips.  Paper basket full of processed fried food is a better description."}
{"text":"I heard about Pete's fish and chips before sounded good. boy was I wrong! The fish look like a deck of cards and taste like it too. No taste no flavor just tasted like breading. Same as with the shrimp  There is no shrimp taste at all . Spent $14 for two. Why they don't take credit cards as I'd canceled it. If you like the tastes of breading. and reconstipated fish. never again!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all these negative comments are coming from.  My husband and I have been eating there for 40 years and 1) it's the same now as it has always been, and 2) if it wasn't excellent fish & chips they wouldn't be constantly busy.  Any given evening, the drive-thru line is packed, with a line out onto Glendale Ave waiting to get in.  We were 10th in the drive-thru tonight, and there were 5 cars in back of us.  I'm not real hot on their heavy-batter items (shrimp, onion rings) but we love the fish and chips!  Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Frozen processed seafood like most fast food joints. The fish patties tasted like the fish sticks mom used to get by the bag full at the grocery store. Maybe I'm too picky.The fish&chips place I did like offered 2 large fish fillets with a choice of beer, tempura, cracker, and one other batters which they then hand battered and deep fried. Came with fries, and drink.The condiments include tartar sauce, lemon wedges,malt Vinegar, and a horseradish sauce for under $8 out the door. Unfortunately that establishment is to far away and Petes is just not worth going to no matter how near or far."}
{"text":"I've had mediocre food, I've had bad food and on occasion I've had food that has made me angry.  Pete's made me furious.  The perfectly rectangular, frozen fish had more breading than actual fish; as well as the shrimp.  No flavor whatsoever, except for the heap of salt they piled on.  The \"cocktail sauce\" is a mix of watered down hot sauce and marinara sauce.  The fries were limp and greasy.  The onion in the onion rings were non-existent, all breading.  Heed all the reviews; this place is vile.  You're better off going to Long John Silver's."}
{"text":"Love this place food is great and so unhealthy for you, I think that's why it taste so good."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I tried Pete's fish and chips. As the name suggests fish and chips should be the best item on the menu. Sadly I ordered a three piece fish and chips, I expected delicious fish, unfortunately the fish is a frozen patties, yuck. I ordered the onion rings, they claim they are battered, not so, once again frozen processed food. My rings were not hot and I asked for hot rings, so I watched them tossed back into the fryer and they served me over cooked rings. Pete does have a tasty sauce, and good thing, it was the only way to eat processed food. Now that I know what they serve when I want fish chips and rings I will find another place."}
{"text":"Attention Phoenicians: THIS is what you call a local gem. Pete's rules. My friends and family that visit from seaboard states demand a meal at Pete's each and everytime. It's one of the valley's great traditions and if you aren't loving Pete's sauce, you're nothing but a cold fish. Long live Pete's!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm.  When it's 115 degrees outside, one should mention that this place DOESN'T have indoor seating let alone air conditioning. As for the food, I started laughing when I saw somebody brave enough to eat it but the person who took the order was nice."}
{"text":"From the time we ordered to the time we left we waited around 30 minutes in the drive through. The problem was with the girl at the window who has 0 customer service skills and let alone social skills. It would have been nice for her to at least address the long wait."}
{"text":"Take credit cards! It's the 21st century!! If you don't want to get a merchant account, then get Square + and iPod touch or iPhone...done. No excuses with that. 

Other than that, Pete's special is great value for your money. Though the shrimp is just flour with small amounts of shrimp in it bent into the shape of a shrimp."}
{"text":"As tourists we were told we had to eat here. Disappointing. What was good= quick service, friendly staff. What was not so good= bland frozen fish, mediocre fries. Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a valley institution. Bring cash. Don't feed the pigeons. Outdoor seating but misters help cool in the summer. Their fish is an acquired taste so I understand some of the negative reviews. My wife hates it so I eat here by myself. (She is not a local anyway).  I recommend the 4 piece fish and chips with an extra 2 oz special sauce. I have been eating here since I was a kid and hope to be eating here well into my retirement."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all of this place. Sure I'm biased as I grew up in New England, but seriously this is just terrible food, terrible service, and really not worth the money. I was trying this place for a second time to give it a fair chance. My fiance and her friend love this place so I went along to give it a second shot. When I pointed out to a friend that was eating the shrimp that if he peeled off the breading and looked at how much shrimp was in there he would be suprised... He did it and just as suspected there was a little piece of shrimp about the size of a maccaroni elbow stuffed into all of that breading. All we could do was laugh... this place is a joke."}
{"text":"If I didn't have to give a star to review, I wouldn't. I just placed a huge order for my family and they gave enough fries for one person. I could literally count the fries. We called and they handed the phone to the manager and she kept making excuses.  Apparently, she was the one that put the order together.  My family will not be back there again."}
{"text":"I practically grew up here!!!  I remember Ruth and my Dad loves her.  It is cash only.  They don't take credit cards so hit the ATM before you go."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, frozen fish rectangles from the store, cold burger, warm frys, special sauce is plane ole ketchup. Wouldn't eat here in a bet. 
Staff wanted to argue about cold burger, just thru all the food away. 
Won't be back. 
Would give minus star if possible."}
{"text":"We love Petes Fish N Chips. We enjoy being in downtown Old Glendale. Good food good prices."}
{"text":"Disgusting.

No offense, but I'm really confused to why I was recommended to this place. It was a dump, the staff was extremely rude and did not answer any of my questions. Being new to the area, all I told them was that I had never been there before, they ignored it and took my order. Once I received my food (which literally came 2 seconds later, clearly frozen or old) the staff was NOWHERE to be found. I wanted to ask for napkins and some sauce/ketchup, but no, they were too busy to answer me.

I am not a picky customer, but I thought that was extremely rude. On top of that, after I ate here, I got really sick. Not just sick to my stomach, but sick for quite a few days. I will NEVER return to Pete's Fish & Chips, especially in Mesa."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a while and finally did so after driving by during the lunch hour. What a disappointment, I can't believe they have been in business for so long. The fish is fine but seems to be just frozen squares of fish fried up. (My son did like it quite a bit) The chips (fries) are mediocre at best and they give you lots of a bland sauce to put on everything. There didn't appear to be any malt vinegar and the tartar sauce costs extra. I had to go back to the window to request catsup.  They do not take credit cards which I think is a foolish business practice. I have now eaten here once and that is more than enough."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  Frozen deep fried trash. This place may be old and a community staple, but the foods is not good. At all."}
{"text":"Pete's is a Phoenix institution, I have been eating there my whole 30 yrs of life and it was always good fish for good prices. My dad would get catfish, I would get shrimp, and my mom whiting. I haven't had it and yrs so I stopped by the Glendale location (I haven't had this location, only the south side and Van Buren) Well guess what, they only have \"fish\" now! And do you know what kind of fish? Not Alaskan whiting, catfish, or even Tilapia, just \"fish\". And not any old kind of \"fish\", but the frozen elementary school \"fish\". The crazy thing is I remember fish fillets, not square processed fish. It was bland and they only have Pete's Sauce which is Cocktail sauce, ketchup, and hot sauce mixed together. They used to come seperate in there own plastic containers,(Pete's has never had tarter sauce fyi) now they just mix it all together and won't give it to you seperate. I dont even like ketchup. And the fries were hot, but salt-less, making them bland too. I'm just really saddened about my experience and I'm hoping this is the only location with fish like this. Hopefully the original stands are still serving good food and this is a one off, hopefully..."}
{"text":"Let's see 40 minutes stuck in drive thru, to get a rude guy to say can I take your order then to pull up to window and get a gal that gives you a total , after i said hi..no apologies for the wait time, no smile , no anything from anyone there. Just a here's your order & having the  window slammed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years with my grandparents, parents and now my own kids! The only con is being closed on Sundays, but I get why...it never fails, I'll have a craving on a Sunday! BOM NOM NOMS!"}
{"text":"I love fish and chips and I was excited to see what the hype was about this place. I came on a Wednesday afternoon and it was pretty busy, I can only imagine what it is like on a weekend night! First of all, the menu is super confusing, it took me awhile to figure it out. The girl working at the window was not a happy person, she was VERY straight forward and no smile, aw. My friend got the monster burger and she loved it, I got fish and chips and I liked the fish, but I wasn't a fan of the fries. The red sauce is good but I really wish they would have had ranch. Another weird thing is that they only accept cash, like this is 2015. Yeah they have an ATM, but I don't think anyone likes paying a $6 ATM fee. Overall this place is just alright, I'd much rather go to Friday night fish fry elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place for years....food is outstanding!!!  Hey, its a hole in the wall, but sometimes those are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!! We have been going for years and we order the same chicken nuggets and chips. They tasted like they were left in the fryer to long and the chicken inside was dry. To top it off worst customer service ever!!!! I called to let the manager know about the horrible food and his response was the chicken is new. This is not an excuse, replace it or give me my money back. Don't just give me a lame ass apology. We will never return again. I would have given them no stars if possible."}
{"text":"Pete's fish and chips is the WORST meal I've ever had! I do not know how people can stand to eat there. I went there just last night for the first time because I had gotten a recommendation from friends. I ordered the fish and chips. The first bad sign was that the fish was pollock. The fish ended up tasting like mushed, cheap, pre-frozen fish. My daughter ordered a cheeseburger with cheese and mayo, plus onion rings. The cheeseburger had an extremely thin patty and way too much mayo. It was so bad that we threw away the food and ate at a near bye McDonalds. If you have any taste in food whatsoever, you will be disgusted by their food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you don't like it you don't belong in Phoenix. I've been going here since I was a kid and I hope they are still here long after I'm gone!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pete's for as long as I can remember my dad would always take us there when we were little kids now we're growing up have our own kids and we take our kids we use to go to the original location on Central I used to be really good back then I recently went it doesn't taste the same anymoren. So we go once in awhile when we crave it.."}
{"text":"Food poisoning again...
One time shame on you, 2x shame on me.
Sucks cause this place used to be local and owners cared more..."}
{"text":"It's okay. I don't see what the fuss is all about. What pissed me off is I ordered tartar sauce the first time I went here, and when I got home, it was nowhere to be found.

I've been back a couple times and it seems to taste a lot better after my initial trial."}
{"text":"Just a Phoenix this the sauce makes everything taste better. It's just a Phoenician thing might not be what everyone likes but if you grew up here than you know what it's all about."}
{"text":"Ordered fish and shrimp combo. Both sucked. Fish sticks in school cafeteria are better. Shrimp was horrible, like they had been sitting in sun for 3 days before being cooked. I wouldnt use this for bait. French fries were ok.

I know why price is so cheap. Old seafood no one else bought at the dock."}
{"text":"Best \"fish sticks and chips\" in downtown Glendale, and I only had to wait 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"My order of fish literally looked like a hunk of fish pulled from a box in the freezer. It was square, expensive and completely tasteless. I can't believe I wasted so much money on this crap. The woman was extremely un-personable and for some reason my block of square fish took 10 minutes to make. Don't go here, ever."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad ratings, and I'm usually pretty forgiving. My husband had a yen for fish and chips, and this place was relatively close to home and VERY reasonable. However, the  $4.30 price for the 2-piece fish and chips meal should have given me a clue. The fish was heavily breaded in oblong \"patties\" that tasted like the fish sticks you remember from the school cafeteria. The chips (French fries) were a mixture of limp and semi-crisp, as if they had been sitting around for a long time. The meal comes with a cup of \"sauce\"--a version of cocktail sauce mixed with something else and kind of soupy. I don't recommend it, unless you have kids you need to feed cheaply."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since I moved here 2 years ago. What a disappointment. I was warned that the fish was frozen but sometimes I'm not super picky about that, at least if the batter is good. This is not the case here. Gross, bland, only redeeming quality was the iced tea. I'm frankly shocked that a business that started in 1947 and has this crappy quality food is still in business. I love to eat at local, family run businesses, but will never be back."}
{"text":"It's cheap, processed, nothing facy fish and chips spot. You get what you pay for. That special sauce people rave about, don't be fooled it's nothing spectacular. If I wasn't so broke, I'd eat @ Knock Kneed Lobster"}
{"text":"Like many institutions in Phoenix, you can't live here unless you LOVE Pete's!! I have seen and heard many a Phoenician defend their beloved Pete's as they would that other famous fast food mecca Carolina's. 

I have lived in Phoenix my entire life and love Pete's and this is why I can stay! lol. From the street, it looks like an old take-out place that's all cute and retro... but noooooo... it's really an old take out place. and it produces some serious food! Whenever I go, I always peek at the mini factory of people dredging and frying all sorts of goodies. Shrimp (my fave), fish filets, hush puppies, corndogs, burritos and fries. 

Once upon a time there used to be signs that read \"NO TATAR SAUCE, SO DON'T EVEN ASK!\" and all you had was Pete's patented red sauce that was part ketchup, part hot sauce but all lovely. Pete's sauce made everything taste better. It went well with the corndogs, the burritos, the fish, the shrimp, the fries and don't even get me started on the burgers!
Sadly, after DECADES of refusing the Phoenix masses their precious tartar sauce and forcing them to enjoy Pete's sauce (for their own good) Pete's has caved and now offers Tartar sauce... and it sucks! So now many people won't even get the chance to even try the glorious Pete's sauce... cuz they want their old standard Tartar sauce! *sigh* 

My fellow yelpers, if you haven't had Pete's yet - GO! And try the fish & shrimp combo and if your appetite is healthy - try a small burger and get extra sauce and enjoy!! It's worth it!! :)"}
{"text":"no tartar sauce. basically the fish is a fish stick but it For real will be The Best Fish Stick you've ever had. you'll want more. for the uninitiated it can seem a little rude but like the soup nazi you simply need to know the pete's culture. to help your dining experience 1. before stepping up to the screen, know what you want. 2 cash only. 3. don't even ask for tartar sauce. 4. outdoor seating only. 5. cash only."}
{"text":"My husband took me here because he heard it's a Arizona thing. Food was good not fantastic but good. I would gladly be back but now any time soon"}
{"text":"I agree with with my sisters . . . the old school Pete's (on Mesa Dr.) was so much better than the Pete's nowadays.  We were raised on Pete's.   Through the years the quality has gone down hill.   What is up with the white cheese in the monsterburgers?  The taste of the patties has also changed.  I miss the buttery taste on those buns too. The fries are over fried most of the time.  Today, the special sauce was off completing the change in the quality and taste of the meal.  I will think twice before going to Pete's from now on.  :("}
{"text":"15 minutes after my wait in the drive thru of \"cash only\" I couldn't help but think about the negative impact this business has on the environment. I see several cars ahead of me receiving several bags of food. It starts to make sense \"why the wait\"; large orders. Finally my turn! I think to myself; \"this should be quick, my order is small\"... 6 more minutes later I finally get my change and food. What I learned about my stay at the window... One person's job is to check to see how many cars are coming while the other two prepare food, with no sense of urgency, I've seen molasses move faster. Upon arriving home I see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam. Nice Pete! My mushrooms are just water battered in salt and there is an excessive amount of \"chips\". I generally don't like wasting food, but, as I am not a pig and all I wanted we're fish and \"mushrooms\" I did throw some away. I don't imagine this food ages well. Needless to say; I experienced them, I don't get it and I will not be back."}
{"text":"terrible place. We ordered 5 pieces fish and chips to go. They are calling number 10 when we placed order. We are number 20 and 30 mins later they are calling number 14. Dont come here and waste your time!"}
{"text":"Wow! Fish & Chips! What a disappointment. I have never caught a square fish. It was something that you can go to Costco and buy. Heavy breading not batter no favor fish. Heavy breaded, tiny bay scallops that got lost in the breading.
If you truly enjoy fish & chips pass this one by."}
{"text":"what fish and chips place doesnt serve tarter sauce with the fish?

sauces are so necessary for these plain, dry fish rectangles. 

don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Any similarity to fish or chips is merely coincidental.   Sauce is pretty good and prices okay.  Didn't expect much and it delivered.  Sorry I dont like to give bad reviews but hard for a business to improve if people don't provide feedback."}
{"text":"Me and my kids were fans of the late, great, Sullivan's Pier on Gilbert and Main and had heard how popular Pete's Fish & Chips was from the natives. We decided to try it and soon wished we hadn't. Cash only. Tartar Sauce costs extra and no ketchup at all. No bathroom, which is sorely needed because my stomach started cramping soon after trying the food.
The fish is square with nasty breading and the shrimp haven't been cleaned properly and are breaded with an unseasoned cracker crust of some sort. The food comes with a runny red cocktail sauce and the fries are just completely unappetizing.
If you ever think about trying Pete's Fish and Chips, don't. Try Long John Silver's, Gorden's fish sticks from the grocery store, or a McDonald's Filet of Fish, all of which taste better than the  slop served at Pete's Fish & Chips."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I am required to give it at least one star, which is one star too many.  I've eaten fresh seafood on both coasts, and this stuff is just nasty.  Pathetic, minuscule, fish-like goo pieces surrounded by massive amounts of horrible, overcooked, cornmeal armor.  Do your taste buds a favor and run away - fast."}
{"text":"Just pounded a messy fish sandwich with some amazing onion rings. I can't get enough of this place! I've been coming here since I was a kid, 25 years later it still hits the spot. The new addition of Casey's Awesome sauce is no joke. Now my kids ask for a Pete's run about every other week. Thanks Pete's for being such a pillar in Mesa."}
{"text":"This is actually a nice location with lots of parking and plenty of outdoor seating. However,  the food was terrible. We had fish, shrimp, fries and onion rings. First of all, you can't upgrade your fries to onion rings, which is ridiculous, even for an upcharge. But the worst part was that everything tasted the same. Shrimp were dry. Fish was flavorless. Fries were overcooked. The onion rings did have a different batter, a bit sweet, and got their only taste from the salt sprinkled on them. The fish was just a square, like you'd get from your grocer's freezer, so I''m not sure what we're paying for. Even their sauce was like a sweeter ketchup. The rice krispy treat was a great consistency but tasted like coconut.  Overall, a huge waste of $20."}
{"text":"I don't think you press some white processed substance into a 9 iron shape and call it shrimp. Can someone send this to a lab or something? I need to know what I ate!!"}
{"text":"I gave it a three because of the inconvenience of always having to carry cash when I go here, as they don't accept cards nor $50/$100 bills. Also the cod fish is flavorless... The French fries are ok, as is the shrimp. But the number one reason why I gave this place 3 stars is because they don't have catfish!  Excuse me for being high maintenance but I'm from Southern California where the staple fish of fish joints is catfish!"}
{"text":"I've been a Pete's fan for over 45 years going back to the days of fresh cut fries and long slender crunchy shrimp.  For a quarter you could get two fish sandwiches.  I remember the patties being thicker with more fish and less breading. Pete's restaurant chain began changing their signature offerings sometime in the 1980's. I was a Pete's addict so I rolled with the punches. The price and the red sauce will hook you in. This being said this store has taking an all time low. What's with the little flat over cooked dry shrimp nuggets, terrible.  Maybe a little salt to bring out the flavors will help. After  all these years I am looking for a new deep fried seafood fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay I have to admit I haven't been to Pete's in years it was always good not the best but good especially for the price now it sucks always gotten the Shrimp Basket the shrimp was always well-balanced shrimp to better and they were long now there small chunks of batter it seems I couldn't really find the shrimp flavor all tastes like was cornmeal no good even at the cheap price and the fries were cold that was weird I've never had cold fries from here but at last another place that's been around for 30 years has went downhill very sad day"}
{"text":"When a place is always as busy as Pete's is, it must be great, right?  That's almost always true but Pete's is an exception. It's actually a mystery. Why are people lining up for disgusting frozen fish? 
The first sign that we should have kept walking was that they had no malt vinegar, so I knew then that it wasn't going to be English-style fish and chips. Instead they give you a little cup of sauce that seems to be ketchup with a little horseradish mixed in. Not great and it reminded me of eating Van de Kamp's fish with ketchup when I was about five.
Bottom line- everything here comes from a freezer. All of it. Tasteless and greasy, we each ate one piece from our plates and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"We've been customers for a long time and have always enjoyed their food. I'm going to have a hard time going back. I couldn't get any soda through my straw so I opened the lid and amongst the ice something caught my eye. I reached in and began to pull out a very large plastic bag! It was so disgusting!!! I called to store and told them but as I was tied up the entire day (finished at midnight) and I couldn't make it back. I submitted this direct to them on their website, asking them to contact me and it's been a week now. Nothing. Plastic in the ocean is bad for the fish. Plastic in your drink is bad for the customer. #Pl"}
{"text":"The food is delicious the reason for one star is the extremely poor customer service. The lady taking my order was very cut off she didn't even open the screen when taking my order.  She was just in a foul mood which is honestly not my fault. If you are unhappy with your job, just get one that will fulfill you don't make it a bad experience for everyone else."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because I'm a loyal Tolleson Petes customer. I decided to give this location a try for the first time. The staff here is rude! As I was waiting for my food, I saw them deny a little girl a refill on her drink. REALLY? The gal at the pickup window was obviously irritated. The straw dispenser wasn't working and she saw that, so she swiped the top off of it and told me to reach in....ok! Sorry? I just didn't feel valued here. Please teach this staff proper customer service! Won't be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pete's Fish and Chips since I was in diapers. I don't know about the fish, but I ALWAYS get the shrimp and chips and an extra serving of the sauce. The one in Tempe had better shrimp but the one in mesa will always be my favorite. 
I had moved to IL for 9 years and had my dad send me a gallon of Pete's sauce fed ex, just so I could get my fix.
I agree that it isn't the fanciest restaurant, and yes you have to buss your own table, but how is that any different from any other fast food place. 
Remember AZ is landlocked. Any place that claims to serve \"fresh caught\" is totally lying. 
For those of us who have lived here our whole lives Pete's is the end all be all of nostalgia.  Yes it is all deep fried food.
For those complaining about the extra charge for tartar sauce, consider yourselves lucky 10 years ago the sign said \"we don't serve tartar so don't even ask\"."}
{"text":"We love Pete's! Try the onion rings with tarter sauce. Nomnomnom. Great service as well. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the other reviews, it would seem that people either love or hate this place.  Luckily I am one that loves Petes!  From having a bit of salt on my fish to their \"secret sauce\".  While I can understand how some might not find their food appealing, it hits my taste buds just right!  I would say its worth a try, if you have never had it before. Worst case you get something in your belly. Best case you have a new place that you love to visit!"}
{"text":"If you have the ordering/cash only/pickup window system of Pete's down, you're all set. My go-to for Fish and Chips since the 80s -- red sauce is good, but I recently tried their tartar sauce. Pretty spectacular! Also, they're brewing up another local favorite -- China Mist iced tea."}
{"text":"Been going here for many years.  It's family owned and one of the few places that still only requires cash. It's clearly written everywhere on the building they don't accept credit cards. People still try.

Food is good and reasonable. I personally like the shrimp and love the onion rings with petes sauce! Jeez petes sauce is good with everything it seems like."}
{"text":"It was okay. Got the shrimp and the fish and chips. It tasted fine but nothing special. There was too much breading on them. You couldn't really taste the fish very well. The tartar sauce was good and so were the fries. They also gave us a good amount of fries with each meal."}
{"text":"I don't know where all these reviews are coming from.  Simply put, Petes Fish and Chips is the best!  Shrimp and chips taste great!  Fries are great!  Burgers are great and the burritos are great!  I think most of these bad comments are from outsiders who were expecting some 5 star diner taste.  No, this is streets not classy dine in.  Everytime we hit Arizona, the first place I have to stop is Petes!  Now if you experience different, I don't know what to tell you...The only thing that stinks about this place is they don't accept cards!  Get some extra sauce too! :)"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for the first time. We had drove by a bunch, but never actually stopped in. We would've been better off saving our money and just spending $10 at the grocery store in the freezer isle. Everything is bland, hard, and mostly batter compared to the fish or shrimp inside. The only good thing is the sauce but that's cause sauce can mask any crappy food. Never again...So so so disappointed!"}
{"text":"In no way shape or form impressed. It tasted just like the frozen crap that you D thaw and then throw in the oven. Not a recommendation"}
{"text":"I have heard of Pete's, but had never eaten here until today. As you walk up, it smells pretty fishy. I was a bit leery of eating here.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that my shrimp had a clean, non fishy taste to them. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Tucson AZ so they don't have a Pete's fish & chips there so since I moved to phx I tried this place since my gf recommended it and now I love it and like eating here!!!"}
{"text":"I was debating between giving two or three stars with this review. I really really really REALLY dislike going to places that are \"cash only\". It is 2015! I am normally not carrying cash on me. It truly fathoms me that any restaurants are still cash only in this day and age. Pete's is a chain, so one would think that they could figure out a pricing model that allows them to start accepting plastic. 

I settled on the two star review because I feel like the employees want you to have the most inconvenient experience as possible. If you are going with someone and want to pay separate they will not let you do so. It's really not that hard to do separate checks. I can see not letting customers get crazy with several different orders, but two separate orders should be totally doable. 

As for the food, it really is very good. I always get the chicken tenders and fries. The red sauce is amazing! I just wish the service was on the same level so it would be more convenient to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Crabettes, Yum! My go-to, then shrimp. They'll even let you mix it up
Cash Only
Only dissatisfaction-reason for 4 stars, because Id eat there so much often...not sure why they only take cash, I think they would make up the cost of credit card charges 10-fold if they excepted it. I'd be there every week but their a little out of the way so not always having cash on me when I'm in the area sucks. I've got to plan my Pete's trip. 
Other than that small payment deal. I've been eating Pete's since 2003 and it's always stayed the same! 
Damn good cheap fish fry! 
Not top quality fish, but who cares, your there for Pete's breading and sauce! 
Ask for extra just pay the 10cents you'll need it! 
Happy eating my friends"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews for this place cracks me up, mostly because they are all true, the 1 stars and the 5 stars...too funny. 

Yes, the biz operates in a very counter intuitive manner, I mean come on, cash only (they do now have an ATM at the front, after 70+ years in biz...), no restroom, the employees are anything but friendly, even when they call your number, they say \"24\", not even \"number 24\" or \"now serving...\" just the number, and in such a disgusted tone. And nothing but outside seating in the scorching heat (although they do have misters)? 

But really, would any other tactics do this place justice? The place is nasty, in a nasty part of town, what, should they have spent some money unnecessarily, given the place a little spit shine, made it pretty, trained the staff to be more chick fil A like? No across the board, their biz is perfectly in line with the totality of their circumstances.  

Now, where I do disagree with the 1 star reviews is the food. It may be nothing more than \"glorified fish sticks\" accompanied by \"watered down ketchup\", but dammit that watered down ketchup has el pato sauce in it and the fish sticks are much larger than the kind you buy at the store, plus they are deep fried. So five stars for the food! 

My wife gets so angry because this is my chosen place for birthday lunch each year. I must admit, there is a component of nostalgia to my five stars and that would be due to the re-enactment of cherished moments of my youth (as I shed a lone tear...) because Pete's was one of the few strong holds that continued to offer Dr. Slice after many others stopped. Anyone remember Dr. Slice? How they ever stopped making that, I will never know. 

Any who, should I ever find myself on death row requesting my last meal, Pete's Fish and Chips will lay claim to that honor!"}
{"text":"I don't get Pete's at all... It's like one afternoon someone walked into Costco, bought a bunch of frozen bags and started a fish n chips chain, and people line up for it!? First the fish... Preformed frozen patties. Crispy, but completely boring. Fries... Frozen standard boring fries. The special secret sauce.... (Secret revealed!) a mix of ketchup and cocktail sauce. There's nothing really horrible about any of it, it's just plain, boring frozen food that's been deep fried. The only reason people really come here is because you get a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  The scallops were large and tasty, fries done great, onion rings good.  Today we went there, fish was awful, in cake form, like from the store, over cooked on top of that.  Fries were underdone, onion rings well over cooked, kind of like onion chips, dry.....scallops were bay scallops, small and tasteless, more breading than scallop.  Waste of time and money. They asked what kind of sauce, we said tartar, he gave us one for 3 dinners.  When I asked for another, he charged me.   I was actually looking forward to the food from the previous times.  One star is being generous."}
{"text":"Cash only is the only gripe I have about Pete's, not worth loosing a star for. I  Always get the 16 piece shrimp and large red sauce to my self, kids get the five pc. fish which always leaves some for me. If it's not a landmark it should be, right in the heart of Glendale, and right in the center of my heart. Shrimp is the best, second is the fish, and third is the burros, all must be eatin with the large red sauce, Louie."}
{"text":"Fish sticks and fries. That's what the new name should be. Joke that the call these square \"fish\" patties food"}
{"text":"I love Petes, my husband had his softball practice for his work, and we were hungry afterwards. So we stopped by, i got the #2, 2 fish and i think 7 shrimps and fries and drink...my husband had #1 which was 1 fish and singe shrimp fries and drink...plus my son got the 5 piece chicken from kids...everything was less than 24 dollars.. Now i had only ate a little bit of mine but i ordered the bigger one cause i knew my husband would eat the rest. We all left full...only thing is the parking spots need to be bigger...kinda cramped."}
{"text":"basic square pieces of fish that has a better batter than fish quality.  The fries were heaviy on grease and lacked any french fry character except their shape."}
{"text":"Tasty greasy goodness at this fish take-out chainlet.  A friend who's lived here all his life raves about this place as a good fast-food alternative.  Cheap, decent fried food, and quick service.  The place is reminiscent of a 1950s drive-in restaurant  with shaded picnic tables abound in front of the counter.  

I'm normally a freakish health-nut.  However, I couldn't help but try this place today, especially since I'm Catholic, it's lenten Friday and I exhausted all other options over the past few Fridays.   This place was really busy, yet quick. 

The fish is square cut (ala Van de Kamps) but tastes a lot better than it looks - same goes for the shrimp.  Fries are nice and soft - and it all comes with some tangy and addictive special sauce (which a little birdy told me is ketchup mixed with El Pato sauce).  So well-received it is, that they sell the sauce as a stand alone item should you want to take it home.  They even had (pause) Orange Bang!   Pete, you're a good man.

Only minuses are the crumb-eating pigeons (you know, the equivalent of rats with wings) running around...but still worth the few bucks you'll spend."}
{"text":"Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Pete's for the first time seven years ago. 
I had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Pete's was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those \"I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips\" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it.

I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious? 

1.) The \"chips\" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldn't even eat them. 
2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gorton's fish sticks. 
3.) The red \"special sauce\".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame. 
4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said. 

Why there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. It's a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips."}
{"text":"I have now officially inducted myself into Pete's Fish and chips cult following. I'm not going to put their free sticker on my car but I can put in on my dryer or smack it on a light pole or something of that nature and I will continue to be a faithful attendant regardless.

About my conversion, the first time I came here I was over it before I started it because they didn't have tarter sauce or proper cocktail sauce and I thought what kind of fish shack does not have these delicious ointments??? But through time I became curious of the long lines and missing  seaside fare, I decided to try it again

What makes this place a success is CONSISTENCY. There is something to be said for it and mastering the Frier!
 
Simply delicious GOLDEN FRIED SHRIMP &  FRIES EVERY TIME! Never greasy!
Oh and I now love that special sauce they make.

Except for missing the cheddar biscuits I now have no need for Red Lobster. My shrimp can be found off the coast of Pete's"}
{"text":"Use to eat here at least once a week back when I worked at the old Darner Chrysler. Sure... It's not fantastic. But for cheap corner walk up window food, it's good."}
{"text":"Boooo... I felt like fish and chips so this sounded like a good idea, I've driven by it many times and it is always busy, i take that as a good review.  Apparently not.  They do have a big cult following, but from what I've learned that is common in Mesa.  

So when i get there i find out they are cash only, seriously? They have been there since like 1947, and apparently refuse to change some things, like getting a credit card terminal... also they don't take any 100 or 50 dollar bills, so it's cash only, as long as it's the kind of cash they want... seriously guys, what are you doing.... Anyway, i want fish and chips so i go to the atm across the parking lot pay an extra 3 bucks to get my money, things aren't starting well. 

It's busy there and i jump in line and as i review the menu find it very comical that for some undisclosed reason you CANNOT get onion rings on Fridays, it says that like 30 time on the menu, they actually had signs hanging in the window to make sure you know... luckily for me it was a Saturday.

Anyway, my number gets called i head up to the window and grab my food, it's kinda cool a plate wrapped in paper, things are looking up a little... then i sit down and open my plate... what the heck is this... they gave me roofing shingles, this can't be fish, it's a little flat rectangle!?! I wanted to go back to the parking lot and check the dumpster for boxes of Gorton's Frozen Fish Fillet boxes (you know the guy with the yellow rain coat) seriously i think that's what they were serving.  

The french frys were soggy, and they don't have any malt vinagar... this place completely failed as a \"fish and chips\" joint....

My recommendation to them: stop acting like it's 1947 and get with.... wait, your busy ALL THE TIME... forget it keep doing what you're doing, i guess people are stupid."}
{"text":"I will come to this place even when I'm 90 years old. I grew up eating Pete's Fish and Chips and nothing has changed as far as my love for it. I love the fish, crabettes, scallops, shrimp, onion rings, and fries. Even though this is a fish and chips restaurant, their monster burgers are superb!! My husband gets the chicken strips every time we go and he LOVES them. Something about their jalapenos too. They are always better than the ones I have at home. Don't even get me started on their Pete's sauce. It is the BEST!!
The only thing that I don't like that has been EXTREMELY consistent is the customer service. They are always so, so rude. I've even heard them talk trash about people in line. They also take a long time to get your order to you. 
This place is so dang good though that I'll always come back, regardless of the awful service. That says a lot about their food."}

{"text":"Everyone just so you know Pete's is kind of a dive, but we love the way they have been making their food, you will love it or you don't. Obviously the fish is the best, dipped in their sauce you'll be wanting more. I haven't tried much of their other food but what I've tried is my fav. The fries are okay."}
{"text":"Eat here if your life has been going great and you feel like you're about due for a major disappointment. I ordered a 2 piece meal and some fried mushrooms. What I got was a 15 pound bag of breading."}
{"text":"I live in LA, and I have to get Pete's every time I'm in Mesa visiting family. Nothing like it in LA. Messy fish sandwich + frings + large Diet Pepsi. If you don't know what frings are, you need to come. So good and fast, and fresh every time."}
{"text":"Classic spot in Arizona.  We don't have much to choose from when it comes to Fish & Chips...but its consistent.  I do wish they took Visa even if they charged a small fee for whoever wants to use their card."}
{"text":"No credit cards, no bills over $20, no ketchup (Pete's sauce only), no onion rings or chicken tenders Friday (too popular), no phone orders, no separate orders, no Sundays. But a fried, guilty pleasure. Sometimes that messy fish sandwich with cheese hits the spot; french fries and fried shrimp are especially good."}
{"text":"I've been at this location once before and service was mediocre. Figured I'd give it another shot. I've been in the drive thru line for 15 min. There was 6 cars in front of me. Which has now be reduced to 4. HORRIBLE service! I would've been better driving further to the Mesa location."}
{"text":"Had the messy fish sandwich again along with the best onion rings in the world! I tried the awesome sauce for the first time today.......WTF, where has this sauce been all my life! It's so dang good. Sadly, only mesa has the awesome sauce......but pete's special sauce it's still good as ever!"}
{"text":"Love this place, they have some specialty items that some of the other Pete's don't have, like the fried pickles or the dixie dog, plus they have the yummiest horchata! But just a fyi, the burritos are bomb.com!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has their food frozen and they deep fry it but it is delicious. I usually get a combo because it gives a variety of different stuff and the combo's are very filling, they give fries with them, too. The food comes with some sauce but any additional tartar or cocktail sauce will cost extra."}
{"text":"I will have to ditto Tania S's review.  We did our biz and stopped back to see what the hullabaloo was about.  \"EH\" is right (another reviewer).  Lemon might've been nice but everything she said.  Talk about rude; shutting the order screen so nobody could be seen?  so maybe there's a good reason but the attitude was visible.

Fries were refried which is what you do with fries but these appeared to be OLD because of the obvious brown OLD color, not the typical double fry of FRESH fries.  Again, what she, Tania said....  

Don't bother unless you're from Mesa and that's your caliber of food, you crave FRIED,  or you're starving and that's all there is."}
{"text":"Hey, this isn't a bad review, but you need to know what you're gonna get. Large portions of food... Yes, but for folks that don't want to get a fish stick. Don't come here unless you want the chicken strips. I wanted fish. If you see the photos on any of the reviews of the fish, that's what you'll get. One poster said it reminded him of the frozen fish sticks that his mom used to make.

If you want chicken strips, then you'll love theirs."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food is always hot, crispy, and very good! I always get the number two to share with the husband. (Includes two fish, 6 shrimps, fries, and a drink) for about $10 with tax!!!! I usually never eat seafood at fast food places because it's usually gross, but at Petes it's so good! Definitely recommend! 
Oh and cash only!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for many years.  I really enjoy the monster burgers and the red sauce.  Kinda funny going to a fish and chips joint just for the monster burgers but it is worth the trip for me.  Thank you Pete's and all that you do."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is not a good fish and chips place at all. I am surprised that they have been open since 1947. They serve frozen fish squares and french fries that you can find at any supermarket frozen food section. The fish was even overly fried - too hard and dry. Also, the fish doesn't come with tartar sauce - they charge extra for that. Instead, they give you Pete's special sauce, which is ketchup and hot sauce mixed together. 

The only good thing is that they are pretty cheap. Two square pieces of fish and french fries for $4.25."}
{"text":"Was going to stop by after work tonight and take some home but after reading all these terrible reviews - I guess I won't waste my money."}
{"text":"No stars, unfortunately Yelp won't let me...Just all bad and all sad...If I had a bun I could've made a Filet-o-Fish. Could've gone to McDonald's and gotten a a Filet-O-Fish and fries for less."}
{"text":"Do not waste you hard earned money. Super fail. No flavor, no compensation for poor service and poor product. Sorry to see what was a good establishment go from 100% plus to almost 0% not only in the food quality, as well as service. Just so disappointed"}
{"text":"So slow. On order 50 when we ordered and 25 minutes later were still on order 53.... yikes. I hope the food is comparable to other petes to make the wait somewhat worth it."}
{"text":"Fish good. Shrimp good. Hamburgers ok. Fries horrible. Pepsi excellent. Hard to mess up on Pepsi :). Pete's sauce great. Honestly if it was for the sauce I think a few things would lower in taste. 

This place isn't the best place ever but it's still pretty good. Oh bring cash because Pete's is still stuck in the 1980's."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for when I want a fast food burger.  The price of a giant double cheeseburger and fries will run you less than any typical fast food chain and taste much better.  However, I have not ordered anything else from the menu so I can only speak for the cheeseburgers which keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"If you got a hankerin for some good fish and chips this is the place you need to go. They only take cash which is the only drawback. But it's well worth it in the long run. Can't beat this fish and chips anywhere. The people are always nice. It's like having friends in the business."}
{"text":"Seriously...The food is AWFUL!!!!  Stay away!   Save your cash and get a McFishwich and some pink slime at Mickey D's (it's that bad).   Any self respecting foodie or experienced seafood patron will hurl.   Just because Pete's \"looks authentic\" don't get snookered.   The outdoor seating looks fun but the food will disappoint.   I should have known better than to try seafood in the desert.

Let me discuss my pedigree for this assessment.   I'm from the east coast.  I grew up around a seafood restaurant eating Maine lobster, fresh scallops, fresh shrimp, fresh oysters, fresh claims...you get the picture.   The \"fish\" at Pete's is literally just a square patty of processed fish that is overly deep fried in a crunch batter.  They don't even make an attempt to use something resembling fresh fish.    The deep fried shrimp (again, overly fried and crunchy) looked like it had been pounded flat with a meat tenderizer and then subjected to a rolling pin before being dipped in oil.   Both the fish and shrimp were tasteless.   On an equally disappointing level, the french fries (usually a saving grace when the main course if bad) were equally terrible.   The fries were undercooked, limp, lacked flavor, and just didn't look appetizing.   Finally (and let me repeat...SAVE YOUR MONEY) we come to the \"Pete's Special Sauce\".   I can't believe they actually charge extra for this crap.   The sauce tastes like a cross between grocery store cocktail sauce and a hint of bad hot sauce.   It's watery, lacks any redeeming flavor profile, and bland.    If anything tasted OK it as the cole slaw that came on the \"Messy Fish Sandwich\".  The sandwich is really nothing to write about (same crappy square fish patty, same putrid special sauce, cole slaw, and an enriched white bun...blah).   At least the \"Messy\" had some flavor.

To top it all off, the staff is emotionless and bordering on rude.   My order taker came across as if he were a struggling college student who felt the job at hand was beneath him.   

The best (and I mean BEST) part of my experience was the water mister on the patio during a 100+ degree day.   At least they still can't mess up the refreshing feel of airborne H2O.

AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative star I would but I had to at least put one star. The food was bland everything taste like everything else because it came out of the same grease  don't go there"}
{"text":"Quick, good, greasy, cheap, and deep fried deliciousness. Don't expect healthy here, but do expect to save some money! Their messy fish sandwich is the bomb, but so is everything else! They have a special sauce that Is so dang good I wish they sold it in stores.
This place is old school, Been around since 1947. They don't take credit/debit cards so bring cash, you know, it's that green paper we used to use to buy stuff!"}
{"text":"We use to go to Pete's all the time back in the day.  Haven't been in years so stopped by one Friday when I surprised the wife at work for lunch.  I should of kept driving.  Just nasty is all I can really say.  First off cash only, but no worry they have an ATM that charges you $3 for cash...Yeah that is pretty ghetto.  Well we order our fish and I was excited because Pete's was so good.  I was impressed by the prices, which should of been a clue.  Anyway, became annoyed that they charge extra for tarter sauce.   Anyway we got our meals.  I had the 1 piece fish and 4 piece shrimp.  The best way to sum this up is frozen overly processed fish.  Seriously Gorton's at the store is 10x better than this stuff.  Sad to see another Phoenix icon failing like Bill Johnson's."}
{"text":"Awful! I don't even think it's real fish! 1st off, there were only two cars ahead of us and the wait was still 20 minutes! Do they only have one fryer??? 

I got the 5 piece fish and chips (ate half) and had the worst gas (stomach) pains all night that I couldn't sleep! The fries were not very crispy. The fish was perfect crispy but square??? Hopefully it was 100% real fish..... 

For $11 I except a much better meal. I can go to a much nicer place at that price. Also did not like that they DO NOT take any type of debit or credit card, they are purely cash only and I can see why. No refunds..... nasty place. Don't go!"}
{"text":"I'll give them one star for the food being hot. If you're looking for a bunless 'filet-o-fish,' go to McDonald's and pay a fraction of the price!! If you're looking for frozen fish squares that are fried and served with flavorless French fries, go here! Not sure why this place is so busy--I ordered the seafood special that comes with massively crusted, fried shrimp and two 'fish' squares, I couldn't even finish one before I realized what a mistake I made in stopping here for lunch. But really, what fish is square?"}
{"text":"I love this place , I'm totally hooked me and my fiancé love coming here and ordering the fish and shrimp &+ extra sauce ! Always will come back to Petes so good , will say sometimes there fries can be soggie sometimes there perfect ! But regardless if something doesn't meet my expectations I bring it to there attention and there more than happy to fix it (:"}
{"text":"I thought I remembered Pete's to be an overall good experience. But my last trip was horrible. The perfectly rectangular, cafeteria fish fillets tasted just as you would think perfectly rectangular cafeteria fish fillets would taste. Boring. From Frozen tasting. The price wasn't too bad in terms of quantity, but still overpriced when considering the quality. 

Employees were rude, off putting, and short. They all seemed mad for some reason. 

It's also silly to be running on only cash purchases in the year 2017. 

Sad."}
{"text":"2 stars. I got the fish and chips and fried shrimp. It's about equal to any fast food grade (i.e. McDonald's ) seafood. Yeah I ate it because I was hungry, but I'd never go back. I asked for horseradish... \"they don't have it\" she said... what kind of \"fish and chips\" place doesn't have horseradish? The dipping sauce was good however. Cash only. I went through drive thru and they didn't give me 1 single napkin. Ridiculous. Glad I got that out of the way so I know to never go back."}
{"text":"I agree, cheap eats!  Nice, greasy, fried food.  I just wish this location was open on Sundays because I always want Pete's after a late Saturday night.  The sauce is my favorite!  Fish, shirmp, fries, and rings.  Can't go wrong.  They even have burgers too!  I always get a huge order of sauce to take home and cook with. it is the perfect combination of tangy, spicy, and sweet.  Get extra sauce . . . you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"I intended for this review to be a scathing critique of the Arcadia location.  I cannot comment on the Glendale Pete's because I have not dined there, my apologies Glendale Pete's Fish and Chips.   This place is worse than the worst review I read so far.  Right, the locals really do love Pete's and I think I know why.  They were brought here when they were kids and have fond memories of the place.  If you want good short order style fish and chips go out to a real restaurant like the Fish Market/Blue Water, try the Hidden House on Fridays.  Hidden House pricing on the specials is pretty good,  the wait staff is cool and they serve beer!"}
{"text":"Being from Wisconsin I thought a good fish fry for Friday night would be good idea.. It was the worst fish I have ever had. And the shrimp were salad shrimp with so much batter on by the time you took the batter off you had something the size of the end of  your pinky. The best part of the whole meal was the tartar sauce"}
{"text":"Place is creepy.  Random homeless people wandering around.  You'd probably get murdrerd if you got out of your car.  Also, the girl working the drive thru window was a total bitch she slammed the window on me.  I ended up getting the hell out of there.  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here since I was 13yrs old. The location was on VanBuren and 40th street, which is no longer there. Now that I live on the west side of town I go the the Glendale location. The patio eating area is huge and clean. I go to a fish and chips place and get a monster burger, WHAT??? The simplicity of a meat patty, onions, pickles and mustered is mind blowing. The fish and shrimp are a must you can't leave without having a little bit of everything. The sauce is flavorful, its a little spicy and sweet at the same time. No ketchup here."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I LOVE seafood!  So for the first day of Lent last week I thought we could try out a local \"fish fry\". We searched on Yelp and discovered Pete's.  
Yes I know, you don't go to Pete's Fish and Chips thinking you are getting gourmet. However, this was way below par for the fried variety. I was actually ill for at least 24 hours after eating here last Friday night. No bueno.

The fish tasted like the frozen patties you can get at the grocery store  and the fries were soggy and tasted only of oil.

If I hadn't gotten ill I would have given them two stars, but after that experience I would warn everyone away!"}
{"text":"THE VALLEY HAS GONE/BEED MAD


Alright folks, as I am sure most of my reviews already spur scorn and outrage to those who read me trashing their favorite establishments, this one cannot be avoided.

This place is garbage.  This is not fish and chips and it is an insult to the term \"fish and chips\" to suggest otherwise.  The \"fish\" is some hybrid type of fish that I have never known in my thirty one years of seafood eating.  It comes in a weird pocket shape that reminds me of a potato knish from Coney Island(which is phenomenal if you get a chance to try one).  The shrimp appeared to walk through on stilts, but thankfully was surrounded by a sub par and tasteless breading.  

What does the valley see in this place? Someone explain it to me because I am truly baffled, this food is just terrible."}
{"text":"Got the 5-piece fish & chips and a superburger with cheese.  The fish itself wasn't anything crazy, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference if I had a blind taste test with this and frozen fish sticks from a supermarket.  The sauce was decent, it's tangy with a tiny bit of spicy.  I suspect if anyone comes here, it's for the sauce.  Although I'd still rather have tartar sauce, which Pete's proudly does not carry.

The 5-piece fish and chips is filling since it also comes with a bedding of fries.  It's $9, but I can't help but think I'd rather pay a few more bucks at a real fish & chips establishment.

The superburger with cheese was just under $2 and it feels like good value at first, until you realize there's a lot more bun than patty meat.  And you could say that you get what you pay for, but you don't - because it's barely any different from a McDonald's standard cheeseburger, in which you could get TWO for $2.

$0.10 for a water cup.  It's not a dealbreaker, but it does leave a bad impression since I can't immediately think of another place that charges for fountain water."}
{"text":"Love Petes my family has been going there for years!! The food is great! So is customer service ! The only thing they always have a huge line and takes forever..other than that its a cool and quick seafood fix! Love the shrimp and Pete's sauce!! The kids love the chicken tenders and burritos! !"}
{"text":"Oh Pete's how I love thee!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. I enjoyed the shrimp and the sauce that comes with it. Fries were ok and fish wasn't great but decent. If you don't like seafood they also have burgers, corn dogs, etc."}
{"text":"50 years ago when I was in high school, this place was a good hang out joint (the 44th st location). The food then was nothing great. Kind of gross, really. So, a visiting friend who had heard it was an Arizona institution (not!) just had to go there. The Mesa Drive location was really crowded - long lines can be a good indication. The Monsterburger was just dull and tasteless. Frozen beef. The onion, pickles, mustard and sauce added nothing. Friend's fish was horrible - couldn't finish it. Grainy, vile, flavorless. So much for nostalgia. The place is dirty, too. Times have changed and people expect more and can get better service, cleaner facilities, and much, much better food elsewhere. Pete's has rested on its reputation (low as it is) and it's time to upgrade, get a new menu, hire a chef and make the food worth a visit. With places like Habit Burger, Five Guys, In 'n Out, Smash Burger, why go to Pete's?"}
{"text":"Frozen fish filets and \"shrimp\" product straight from your grocer's freezer at fresh fish prices!   This place is so gross.  Their fish basket special includes one small rectangular piece of frozen fresh and some very questionable fried \"shrimp\".   I've never been so disappointed upon laying eyes upon an order before.  Please don't go here, it's disheartening.

Also they charge $.50 extra for tarter sauce even though you already paid $8 for a stupid fish stick and $1.00 for a refill.  I could understand if they had to keep fresh stock or something but they don't.

They should change their name to Pete's yuck and chips."}
{"text":"You can find better quality fish and chips at the frozen food isle of a grocery store."}
{"text":"A number of locations in the valley and a reputation for good fish and shrimp.  When I arrived at 3:00 they were quite busy which was a good sign.  The friendly service and nice patio area are where the good times ended.  The combo plate was a close relative to Mrs Paul's frozen squares and Costco shrimp.  Disappointing and will not be going back"}
{"text":"By now, you've probably read a lot of other yelp reviews about Pete's. You probably know that it's cash only, that there aren't convenient bathrooms, that the fish comes in square form, that the lines are often ridiculously long and that their famous Pete's sauce is really their saving grace. 
Pete's Fish & Chips is much more than a mediocre-fried fish restaurant. It's a Phoenix metro area staple. I have traveled far and wide, lived around the world, and to me, no matter how far I go, when I come home to Phoenix- I always want Pete's Fish & Chips. Perhaps I'm biased and nostalgic, but Pete's has earned a special place in my taste buds, and in my heart. 
My two favorite things on the menu are the Shrimp and Chips and the Monster Burger. The food is always  greasy, sometimes the staff are less than pleasant, and orders often take a ridiculously long time for being fast food- but at the end of the day Pete's tugs at my heartstrings. Pete's Fish & Chips, I don't know why I love you like I do, I don't know why, I just do."}
{"text":"I can't even bring myself to star this place but since I have to, it gets a begrudging 1! Sure, the prices were reasonable but I feel sick after eating there.

I asked the cashier if the fish was battered and she gave me a blank, mouth half opened stare, before she said: \"uh huh.\"

The fish was breaded not battered. Strike one.  The battered is so prickly it cuts the roof of your mouth. Strike two.  Biting into the brick o' fish was just biting into a brick of breading.  It didn't even taste like fish!  Strike three.

I will never go here again.  Please do yourself a favor and save yourself the stomach ache I had to endure getting this review to you."}
{"text":"This place is unique but definitely not what you think of when you are thinking about getting fish & chips.  Their \"fish\" are these smallish rectangle patties that are tasty and have fresh fish meat inside.  The chips aren't the \"english style\" chips you would think of either, but just standard french fries.

Their sauce is very good and they also offer ketchup for your \"chips\".  This place has a huge following in the Phoenix area because it has been around for so long but quite honestly not really fish & chips per se."}
{"text":"Greasy fish. It's A dive fast food restrant. This place is what gives fast food A bad name. The staff not nice. Dirty restrant."}
{"text":"Burgers are flat. They never get the order right. Fries seemed like they had been microwaved before sold to us. Check the bottom of your fries and see if it's happened to you to."}
{"text":"Always, always have loved Pete's. Until now. I thought I'd give it a try after disappointment at another Pete's, but it was the same quality.  I got the shrimp & chips, which is my favorite, or use to be. They've changed that batter or just using a Costco type frozen brand. Not the same Pete's I grew up on. The fries aren't even worth the effort to review. My 2 stars is for the Pete's sauce. I need someone to recommend a good fish chip place to go."}
{"text":"I have one rule, and only one rule, when it comes to fish and chips: the thing you are eating should, in some way, resemble what you would expect to pull off of an actual fish.  Now imagine you are making your own fish and chips, and you are pulling off chunks of fish meat, which you will then batter and fry.  Geometrically speaking, what would you expect of these chunks?  Squares?

Probably not.  Either Pete has discovered a species of fish whose meat comes off in nice rectangular pieces, or it is made of heavily processed who-knows-what.

For the record, I suspect the latter.

Physical characteristics aside, Pete's does not have great fish and chips.  Perhaps I'm spoiled, but the fish I'm used to typically has a nice, light, flaky battering, rather than the dense, crunchy monstrosity covering Pete's fish tablets.

Add in less than average fries, and a refusal to allow you to at least put some tartar sauce on your processed fish, and you have an establishment whose continued existence is confounding, to say the least."}
{"text":"The absolute worst \"fish\" and chips I have ever experienced. Fish sticks from the store were terrible--no flavor at all. \"Shrimp\" is chopped up shrimp bits (like bacon bits) covered in a hard crusty breading--ratio of about 98% breading and 2% shrimp bits. And very hard. And it took 30 minutes for one order. There was a line, so I thought it would be good. Nope. I can't imagine anyone coming back after eating here, except desperate college kids. Maybe that's how they survive. This is a harsh review, but it's really the worst I have ever had. I told the manager that, and she could only say sorry we're understaffed today. I don't know who Pete is/was, but he probably once could be proud to have his name on this business. But now he should be ashamed. Really, really bad"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pete's on and off for  35 years.  Love it and always makes me feel like a kid again!!!  Anytime I am down from Alaska where I live I have Pete's."}
{"text":"Literally the worst place I've ever eaten at for seafood. The batter was worse than store bought fish sticks. Along with the shrimp and the onion rings which were hard battered with the same thick batter as the nasty fish. I paid $9.24 for a small piece of fish and 4 largely over battered shrimp with some fries and onion ring mix, and I have never regret spending money at a mom and pop shop before until now. Sadly, the fries were the best part. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"What is this world coming to? Why change a successful recipe and replace it with frozen processed shrimp that look like small dog biscuits. I'm very disappointed won't becoming back anytime soon. I'm a life long Phoenix resident and loved the orginal Pete's."}
{"text":"Still looking for a reasonably priced, good fish and chips place.  I went here yesterday and was somewhat disappointed.  I ordered enough food for my family of 4 and this is what I can say about this place -- service was efficient and friendly.  Food was so-so:  Chicken fingers were good.  Fish was pressed, square processed fish junk; not very tasty or good.  Fries were soggy but onion rings were good.  Cole slaw was good.  Their \"special sauce\" is not good at all -- they really need to add catsup and some tartar sauce options for their customers."}
{"text":"Runny tarter sauce that I paid extra for and the horchata tastes like watered down vanilla coffee creamer. Two stars only because the chips I ordered aren't terrible, but it's a good thing I had some Whataburger spicy ketchup in my desk, cause Pete's sauces are ew."}
{"text":"The best Fish and Chips I have ever had. I had to stop eating there so much due to my Cholesterol but it is a must have if you are out here."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Seriously i didnt even order food i sat behind a guy in the drive thru for going on 20 minutes because my truck is to bug to fit around the car in front of me. Seriously is this what you call customer service. All this because i made the wrong turn into the wrong parking lot and am to big to try and turn around. The guy behind me has been sitting at the order box for at least ten minutes also. I havent even seen anyone come to the window to talk to the person yet like wtf."}
{"text":"This place knows what's up when it comes to some burgers. The price is unbelievable. a 1/3 pound REAL burger with cheese for less than three dollars. No restaurant can beat that. Plus the flavor is so good. This location is the best out of any I have been too. Plus they got a perfect score rating from the inspector. Always clean and tasty. Thank you Pete's Fish and Chips for always coming through."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great. Prices are reasonable and the service I get from the friendly staff here is always outstanding. 
The location is very easy to find and the drive-thru area is kept up as well as the area where the tables are. I always recommend this spot to anyone asking me where to find great food while on the go

{"text":"I'm not much for an all-fried meal but I had Pete's Fish and Chips the other day for the first time and must say it's not bad. I had the shrimp, fish and Pete's Burger with cheese. The fish was not bad but it was not my favorite. I liked the shrimp and burger better. Also, the fries were so yummy when I first got them! Definitely would pick this over McDonald's down the street for any cheat day."}
{"text":"They know how to fry up a square of cod and a price of shrimp. The sauce is a spicy catchup ( mixed with El Pato hot sauce). 

Yeah, the seating is only outdoors and the place is filthy and smelly. Despite the rude signs, the staff is mostly helpful and efficient. You wan t to take out, here. 

Pete's is a Mesa institution, if you've never been, you need to try it."}

I tried this place for the first time Friday night , girls at the counter are rude or ignorant or both , I got the 8 chicken strip combo with fries , the rest of my family got #2's which I think was the two planks and fried shrimp , everything was cold , while ordering I watched food go straight from a box that was frozen straight into the frier , everything was just bland , unless you drenched it with Pete's sauce , blech ."}
{"text":"YUM!  Seriously YUM!

I had been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Finally went for lunch on a Wednesday.  There were about 5 cars in line at the drive through in front of me but the line went quite quickly.  (There were also another 3 + groups waiting in line at the walk up window).

I tried the two piece fish with fries.  The fish was so so so good.  The fries were good also.  I got the tartar sauce and the signature sauce.  Both were yummy.

I was so impressed with the price and product and service that I went back a few hours later for a snack - to try the onion rings. Those were good also but not as amazing as the fish and fries.

I have been dying to go back again ever since.  I must have told a half dozen friends verbally about this place the day I tried it.

Mmmmmmmm  (cash only!)"}
{"text":"This place is foul. My mother told me to avoid it years ago and I decided to try it thinking she may not have liked something I would... Yeah. The fish is no better quality than the frozen fish planks you can get from the grocery store. The fries had very little salt. The sauce is nothing more than cocktail sauce. How this place is popular is beyond me, I guess it's for the AZ natives."}
{"text":"I love this place I've gone here since I was a kid. I always get the 2 piece Fish & Chips and I always get extra sauce because it is so delicious. Petes is one of a kind place. It beats other places that try to copy then."}
{"text":"I have been a Pete's girl for 25 yrs....I am sad to say I won't go back anytime soon...the food quality has done down so much...this makes me sad...I absolutely loved this place once upon a time....the shrimp are small and weird and the square fish I can buy in the frozen department at frys....and don't get me started with the rude cashier and the really rude girl at the window calling out numbers....sad sad day Petes...."}
{"text":"I am completely baffled by why anyone would stick a \"I am addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips\" bumper sticker on their car. Though all my friends swear by it, the one is in Glendale is not all that great compared to the others, and I have visited the others. This family owned money laundering operation has been operated since 1947. Why do I say that? 

#1.) They only take cash

#2.) They have ATM machines outside 6 of their 8 locations. They don't take your card but they got a machine to take your card. How much $$ is the bank paying the business to have those machines on site. 

#3.) Aside from money laundering by ONLY taking cash, how much of it is being reported to the IRS??

My friends also said they happen to give people who have just got out of jail/prison a chance, which I am all for that, but you have no idea what type of blackmailing those owners or managers can do to get those individuals paroles revoked.  Remember in Bound by Honor when Miklo was going straight and the owner of the tire company was cutting his wages from his check for the owner's gambling debts? 

Hm.. not accusing anyone of anything, I just can see through it. Enough about that.
 
I am surprised how long a line of cars down Glendale are lined up to buy Petes, mainly during Lent.. the place is packed.. but the food.. not so good. Why people prefer to waste money here is beyond me.

 The piece of fish tastes like paper card board. It is a piece of square that has been filleted and deep frieds. Good luck finding the shrimp among all the bread. The fries, blah soggy and sometimes cold. Never freshly made.  It all lacks flavors. No salt in anything!  I assume the reason behind that is so that you purchase more Pete's sauce which consists of water downed ketchup mixed with Tapatio sauce. I'm like duh, you don't think some of us would not figure that one out? I paid extra for tarter sauce that I never received, and I was already home before I noticed. 
Makes me wonder if the extra change I paid for, for the tartar sauce, was pocketed and never rang up. hmmm Anyways.

 It's not the same Pete's Fish and Chips I grew up on. Though it is close to where I live,  Petes Fish and Chips needs to start taking it to another level before I return."}
{"text":"Should be call fake fish and chips. Disappointed that they were little squared off frozen fish that I could buy and fry myself at home for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Didn't care for our square fish or the sauce. Both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night.  I won't be returning.  I don't understand the appeal at all."}
{"text":"Looked like they forgot to put salt in my fish and shrimps because they were very tasteless."}
{"text":"Try the fish and chips. The shrimp has a lot of breading. If your looking for cheep this is your place. Only take cash"}
{"text":"I give this place two stars because it does physically exist and you can exchange money for something that once was fish.

This place serves pre-made froze fish squares, french fries, and bean burritos that you can find at any supermarket frozen food section. And not the good supermarket frozen fish the cheapest most generic stuff you can get. Like what comes in a less well to do public school lunch on Good Friday. Not inedible, but not good....

And the service.... God the service is awful, the guy who took my order had me repeat myself 6 times, still got it wrong and didn't even acknowledge me at the drive thru window for all of the almost 12 min it took my food to come out. Instead he sat there with his buddy discussing the finer scientific points of the art of \"Blood Bending\" as portrayed in \"Avatar: The Legend of Kora\"

 A few other notes
CASH ONLY! No $50's or $100's ever
CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!
NO ONION RINGS OR CHICKEN STRIPS ON FRIDAYS!"}
{"text":"I love Pete's. I know, I know - you eat outside, you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash. I love the food anyway. I've gone to Pete's since I was born. I love the red sauce that comes with the fish - it has a little bite to it. 

I only wish they would expand north. 

I'm addicted to Pete's."}
{"text":"Pete's is iconic Phoenix Metro destination that cannot be missed. The Super Seafood combo is satisfying and delicious. Get extra Pete's sauce! Bring cash!

Oh and if you are going to Pete's and you get tarter sauce, \"You're doing it wrong!\""}
{"text":"Horrible place. My battery died and I called and asked them if they could not tow it and I would get it in the morning. They told me the couldn't do that for me and still towed it."}
{"text":"I agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is horrible.  We ordered fish and shrimp combo.  It was over deep fried and crispy - almost brick like.  I had never seen shrimp so over breaded and cooked that you don't recognize it as shrimp underneath.

The monster burger was ok, nothing special but piled on with so many condiments (that I was not asked if i wanted) that is was dripping like liquid.  

And you have to pay extra for the sauces!!!  What?"}
{"text":"I never go here for fish. I only can recommend the shrimp and chips dish. Extra sauce is always a plus. This place never seems to fail. It's always a great place to eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was just awful, no other way to say it! The fish comes in squares like you get in a cheap box of Gorton's at the store or even worse, it made me have flashbacks to the stuff you would get back in grade school. The shrimp has so much coating on it I couldn't even taste the shrimp. Didn't get ANY tartar sauce and 3 samples of a watery ketchup/cocktail sauce. I live only a couple blocks away but fries were cold when I got home. Needless to say, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"ok, 2 stars b/c it's cheap. 

I honestly wish I had read all the other reviews first, and then I wouldn't have pulled in, thinking it was fate that I saw it at lunchtime. Got a fair sampling of everything to take home for me and the hubby to the tune of $18 or so. Ok, maybe not so cheap. Ate it for lunch, have a lot left over but honestly don't want to look at it again. 

Starting with the crabettes - I was not sure of the size, and optimistic that they would be small pieces with real crab. I should have asked but didn't want to identify myself as a first-timer. Or an idiot. Take your pick. 

I should have - my bad - those things are totally nasty. Especially when you start thinking about all the chemicals you're ingesting after the first two bites.

Fish - in line with other reviews, I thought this would be solid pieces of fish in beer batter. Not cafeteria quality square patties with crumbly breading. Everything tasted really artificial. No tartar sauce available as far as I could ascertain. The \"sauce\" they give appears to be just ketchup so why not just call it that? 

French fries - as limp and unappetizing as I've ever seen. And I have a mountain of them left. I'll say this, they don't skimp on these. 

Look, this is the deal, if you're hankering for fish and chips, imo the best (disclaimer - still new here so there may be a better cheaper alternative I don't know about) is Shakespeare's on Val  Vista. Yes, it's more expensive but better to pay more for good food than waste it on bad. $13 to $15 for one person, but the plate is huge - enough for both of us. Less than I paid at Pete's. They also have an all-you-can-eat on Fridays too.

However, I did have an entertaining time waiting the 20 or so minutes in line. Quite a variety of people seem to love it here. The mix, which probably wouldn't be seen together in any other place, was made especially amusing by the 4 young Jehovah's Witnesses in suits and matching blue ties. 

End of visit. No more. At least hubby ate all the cole slaw. And seems fine."}
{"text":"No.

Every native Arizonan swears by this place...so much so that I just had to check it out for myself. And...? No.

The fries were pretty good, and Pete's is generous with them. But the fish? I've had frozen fish sticks that tasted better than that stuff. Yes, I tried the shrimp too. Those weren't much better. So, no.

Wait, their red sauce was kind of good. I do agree with people about that. But, what's the point of good sauce on rubbish food? So, still, no.

Will I be back? I think you know the answer to that question."}
{"text":"I don't understand what prompts people to come to this place.  They don't take credit cards?  Don't try to tell me that's part of the \"charm.\"  It's time to expand your customer base!

However, that won't do you any good if you're always serving up cold, tasteless fries.  The fish patties are decent, but the \"chips\" need some serious help.  \"Chips\" is in your name, for Pete's sake!"}
{"text":"Pete's is something you CRAVE if you grew up in Phoenix. It makes me happy. It's not something I'd brag about to out of town people, it's a childhood nostalgia that drives me back. And why not?  It's cheap, cash only, and a local fave since FOREVER (which isn't long in young Phoenix). News Flash! This is a desert; so fish is not the *freshest* around here or the best. This is not San Diego, Maine, London or whatever coastal town you want to reminisce about. Have you seen the Salt River? Heard about the bladder? Well, go back thirty or fifty years. It wasn't fresh in the 70's either. Duh. But we love them just the same.  We fight over the little cups of Pete's hot sauce. Cash only means they don't have to pay the banks their cut. Yea!  Local Business!  Pass me the fish."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about Pete's. I am from the Gulf Coast and was not expecting to find anything that would compare to the delicious fried seafood of back home. Glad I set my expectations low.
  Pete's fish is ok, square, almost like processed but not. Strange but tasty. Chips are decent, taste like typical Ore-Ida frozen fries. The Onion rings were good (super greasy though). My biggest problem is that I am a bit of a traditionalist. If you are gonna call it \"fish and chips\" like they would in the UK, then you have to at least have malt vinegar. The red sauce is good with their fries and rings (and maybe shrimp) but not on fish. It is the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and may go back, if I am already in the area, to try one. I wonder if they have mustard? They may be trying to do too many things at once here. Seafood, Americana, Mexican, (fish, shrimp, burritos, hot dogs, chicken, oysters) Just a thought.
  The seating is outside, if its summer you must get it to go. Between the heat, pigeons and huge flies (serious kitchen hawks) you will not have a good time. 
  The prices are very reasonable but they only accept cash. I would not go out of my way to eat at Pete's again."}
{"text":"This location sucks balls. One of the guys walked off in the middle of taking my order because I didn't instantly respond with what drink I wanted for my combo. I literally glanced up for a second to see what they had and apparently that inconvenienced him. He handed the order slip to another guy standing next to him and said \"Here you finish this order\" and walked off. The guy taking over wasn't a doll either. He took my cash, gave me my change and closed the screen door on me without any \"thank you\" or anything. 

On to the food... Now, I never really like Pete's to begin with but I'll go because my BF loves it. I think mainly because he grew up eating Pete's, so it has become somewhat a childhood nostalgia. I don't like their fish at all but I find their shrimps decent so that's what I usually get. The shrimps I got here were over battered and overcooked, though. I had to tear off all the edges on them because they were way too hard to chew. 

Bad food and bad service. I will never come here again. Go to the Mesa one or according to my BF, the \"real deal Pete's\" on Central in S. Phx."}
{"text":"Good spot. The fish was extra crispy. Love the fry sauce. Ducks you gotta pay extra for them but really good"}
{"text":"I had high hopes going in.  I figured local  fish n' chips chain this popular must be good. I had heard stories about their great sauce, and fish. However I was less than impressed.

A coworker of mine suggested we go on the way to a meeting. When we pulled up I noticed that the only dining was outdoors, but the place seemed busy which is a must for anything with fish in the name and 100+ degree summers.

I ordered a number 3 which was 3 pieces of fish fries and 1 cup of sauce. Yes the menu tells you how much of this mythical sauce each dish comes with. One of the good thing was the price it was about $5 and I got a discount making it about 4.50 for my meal with a cup of water. Note this was cash only.

I waited patiently for my food and the pickup window finally called my order number. With great excitement I opened the grease covered bag that my meal sat in to find square shaped pieces of fish. I really was hoping for fish in a more natural shape before it met the hot oily depths of their deep fryer. 

I then opened up the cup of sauce and to my surprise it is not a tartar style sauce like I assumed it would be. The sauce is a franks red hot sauce with with some ketchup, far from anything special. the one cup of sauce was inadequate for the amount of fish and fries I had. If I wanted more sauce i would have cost me an extra. There are no other condiments available, so if you like ketchup you are out of luck.

The batter of my fish was passable it just seemed like a McDonald's fillet o fish sans the bun, cheese and sauce. 

The fies were thin and a bit underdone. 

Overall the meal was quite mediocre and I would have enjoyed it more from a chain like Long John Silvers."}
{"text":"Be prepared no credit cards. No $50 or $100 bills. I understand the need to laundry $$$ and keep it out of the governments hands but holy cow. You already charge plenty for your meals so I'm sure you can afford the bank fees. I'm sure it also has some way of screwing employees out of benefits. I would probably say it's time to get with the times and become a legitimate business. 

On a food note they're worth about 3 stars so their current rating is pretty average. Everything taste the same because they fry it all in the same fryers. Crabette's are good, fish and shrimp are decent. Fries are good. Sauce is not my thing and of course their other options are horrible-nothing. 

Thanks for letting me eat at your establishment Soup nazi"}
{"text":"It's Pete's. no complaints, it's food porn no one admits to liking it but its always busy."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in Pete's.

Went with a friend to get a variety & share. We had a hard time distinguishing between a few of the items we got until we bit in, & even then we weren't 100% sure which was which.

Fish 2 pc $3.70 - Thin with too much batter but a decent flavor. Wouldn't get again.
Shrimp 4 pc $3.65 - Was there even a taste to these? Wouldn't get again.
Oysters 4 pc $3.65 - Very fishy. There were actually good. I'd get these again. I liked them.
Crabettes 4 pc $3.65 - I barely remember these, that's how unimpressed I was. Was this even crab?! Wouldn't get again.
Scallops 5 pc $3.85 - Good. Might get these again if I ever went back. My friend liked these.
Chips - What word comes to mind? I think gross might describe these.
Sauce - It was ketchup! I HATE ketchup. I wanted tarter sauce. This was the biggest disappointment. I was so bummed out.

FYI it's cash only.
Also, be prepared to be approached by people asking for money or a meal if you go here, even if you're in the drive-through."}
{"text":"True story-

My brother and I were talking about Tempe... He was there to visit... was waiting for some great home cooked food, right?  Well mom came home with none other than a family size bucket of KFC!  Brother said screw it!  I'm going to Pete's!  

That's the review.  Best fish and chips in AZ."}
{"text":"Pete's has been around forever and if you're from this side of town like I am you probably grew up eating here. I've only ever had the seafood so can't say much about anything else there. The shrimp sizes have gone down so much though:("}
{"text":"I've ever been here before but I've heard good things about it and I had a coupon so might as well. Drive thru took longer than expected to get our food even though we were the only ones there, and the drive thru guy was a little snippy with me, and told me I should have told him about the coupon earlier even though I said I had one before we even started ordering. Fish was okay, wish it came with tartar sauce instead of the red sauce they gave us :/ I wasn't very impressed with it"}
{"text":"1 hour wait!!!? And we were still six orders away! Ridiculous wait! How hard is it to throw fish in a fryer!!?? But drive thru was going fast. Whoever owns this business needs to figure out how to run a business cause they're focusing too much on drive threw. They act like they're making gourmet food. There were staff just walking back and forth with food just sitting there over the fryer with a ton of orders to go!?  No way! Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"I have had Petes many times but I have not been there in probably 10 years. Well I think of going there any time I hear fish & chips but I live in Yuma now. I remember loving the sauce. I happened to drive by this location and I never knew it was here I always went to the Mesa location. Well I had to stop and the food was better than I remember! The crunchy batter is so delicious, I thought I should order extra sauce and I'm glad I did!!! It is a must try!"}
{"text":"Fish and Chips in the dessert - this cheezy place is incredible.  Sign me up!  $8.00 and I close my eyes and I am in Northern Scotland at Banchory Lodge. My first trip here I sit with an Arizona Senator and his family. NO CREDIT CARDS - all outdoor seating and barrios neighbors but still, well done."}
{"text":"Sadly I'm going to give one star,  nothing to do with whether the food is any good but because I drove up with my daughter thru the drive thru, we placed our order then, as we drove up to the window to pay that when they post \"cash only\" at no time did I see anything saying ,\"cash only\" at the board, while placing the order . Although you can park and go inside and use their atm ( which usually amounts in fees , not to mention that usually one goes to a drive thru to avoid the parking and going inside . ) So I left with out my food.. so for that reason and that reason alone I give this establishment one star and will not go to their stores. This us not some little corner kiosk  this us a business , I can't recall when I've last seem a business that only takes cash.. I personally do not carry cash . I wouldn't recommend  this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"I am rating this two stars because of the pathetic customer service that this place has... seriously. The cashier that attended me felt like the humor in her was sucked out, no joking whatsoever. As I am eating my food it is 10:31pm (place closes at 10:30pm) a customer walks up to the window with money in his hand and is denied service all because he was 1 minute late. Where is the customer service in that? You won't serve someone if they arrive a minute late and they are trying to give you their business? Wow. Then a customer is sitting down with food on her table waiting for her friend to get her food so they can eat together. Then a worker tells her to move to another table that is not even lit up by lights  because they are going to spray the tables down. If you ask me that is just straight up rude. If they could train the workers on good customer service it would be great. Also, it's 2018 get with the system and have the ability to charge people using their credit cards if they want."}
{"text":"Sucks that I had to give such a low rating! But my mom said so!! When my mother was visiting us from Cali last week, I brought her to see the light at Glendale. Now originally I was born in Glendale, but was raised in Long Beach! So when we drove by Pete's, my mom had me make a u-turn right to there location. She said as a child her and her sister use to come by all the time and loved it. She mentioned how large the fish use to be, and how good it was. Well, time has changed and she was very upset how bad it is now! The chicken tenders were OK, but the fish and shrimp was to greasy, and taste was lousy. Looks like another mom and pops place that just grew to large and forgot why they were their in the first place. Always happens when the kids and grand kids take over."}
{"text":"Everything you want in a drive-thru fish fry. But a fish fry spot that makes all the other glorious edibles of your southern childhood available as well...awesome-saucesome"}
{"text":"Worst fish and chips in the valley! Pay 4x as much to get fish sticks straight from frozen isle at grocery store.."}
{"text":"3.75 stars.

Fish sandwich better than most.
Scallops & chips for under $4.
Fried mushrooms and zucchini w/ranch.
They've got burgers too if you're getting for a group of peeps and someone isn't keen on fish.

Don't bother w/the \"crabettes\" b/c they're just imitation crab sticks deep-fried. You'll also wait a good 10-20min, even at the drive-thru.

But I'd rather go here any day if given the choice b/w Pete's and a national fast-food chain. I'm not addicted, but I do have some love for Pete's."}
{"text":"Had never been to Petes but they always seem to be busy and the drive through is always packed. So before Glendale Glitters last night, I took my grandson there for dinner. I got the fish and chips, fish bland and square...very weird. The fries were ok, needed some salt but they were better than the fish. My grandson got a burger and fries, he ate about 1/2 the burger and then only wanted fries. He put lemon juice on the fries to give them some flavor. I took a bite of his burger and it was extremely well done and dry. We came, we tried but there is no reason for me to go back."}
{"text":"Lame. Lame. Lame. Claiming to be a fish & chips place I expected real fish-shaped filets. They are pre-frozen squares. The fries are not fresh cut and they are unsalted. They don't give you tarter sauce either... they give you some lackluster mix of ketchup and sugar with a hint of horseradish."}
{"text":"Pete's is the place you want to go if you're short on time and money because it's reasonably priced fish. Don't even think about dining in here. The convenience is in using the drive-thru and I love seeing their mural. I have always wondered - do their murals ever get ruined by graffiti or do the gangsters just respect Pete? 

Cash only. Which I think is a good thing because drive-thru is super fast. The food is always hot and fresh. Everything is breaded and if you say \"no salt\", they've always gotten it right. You can get scallops for like $4. It's a deal, Pete!"}
{"text":"Every time I do a search on Yelp for fish, Pete's pops up but I've always just passed it by. Today I actually decided to stop by and see what it was all about. I can see why one could pass it by, it's just off Central with no flashy gimmicks and no drive thru. I was lucky that the rain stopped long enough for me to get out of my car without getting drenched. 

I didn't know they only took cash and with only $7 in my pocket I came unprepared. I decided to order the 3 piece Fish and Chips for $5.35. I can barely finish the second piece of fish but this sauce is amazing. I will definitely call ahead with a large order of Oysters, Shrimp and Crabettes!"}
{"text":"Pete's Fish and Chips is a restaurant that really does things their own way. 

Tarter sauce, vinegar, and lemons-these are three condiments one would expect to find at any seafood restaurant the world over. Not at Pete's: it's all about the red sauce in these here parts. I must agree with Pete's sentiment. The red sauce is simply fantastic, and compliments the deep fried goodness well. 

I'm not 100% sure what Pete's uses as a main ingredient in most of their food. But I can tell you I'm almost certain it isn't fish. I can also tell you that I'm 100% okay with that. 

Pete's does not accept debit or credit and is not open on Sundays. It seems like they are loudly proclaiming, \"Customers! It is really NOT all about you. We have delicious food, and you must WORK to get it!\" 
And if that's how they roll at Pete's then I'm down."}
{"text":"Honestly the quality of food is about a 3 star but because I support the mom and pop shops and used to go here almost every day during my breaks from the nearby community college it deserves a 4. I've met the owners a couple times and the atmosphere in the afternoon is pretty quiet sometimes which is very nice when you're trying to just have a nice break. There was nothing that I didn't like here and the pricing is good as well, its just you can tell the food was once frozen."}
{"text":"Bomb.com........messy fish sandwich with onion rings and extra Pete's sauce.... And of course some if that yummy Casey's pink tardy sauce! Place is 70 years in the making, an Arizona institution!"}
{"text":"Worst fish and chips place ever. If your not used to eating amazing fish and chips then you might like this place. But if you come from CA you have authentic places like Andreas and Neptunes Net, that actually have real battered fish with a lemon wedge and tartar sauce. At Petes you will find fish that tastes exactly like frozen fish sticks from the grocery store and they make it in the shape of a hash brown with the same type of breading as a hash brown, hence, processed and fake. With no real lemon, only lemon juice packets. And when we asked for tartar sauce, the man behind the counter said, \"you don't want that\" and didn't give it to us. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled by Pacific Northwest fish and chips.  Pollock is not a choice fish for fish and chips. Cod or halibut is the best fish! Pollock is scrap fish!  Somehow the symmetrically cut
Pollock is not appealing, the famous fish sauce is not memorable, the tartar sauce not good. We like the crispy coating but fish was mushy and not tasty. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I hate giving places ratings this low, but I have no choice. We have just recently moved here from Miwaukee, where there are fish frys every Friday. We gave up meat for Lent, and wanted to get some fish, a quick, simple meal that we could take home.  That's where Pete's comes in. The food is disgusting. It's like they have some deal set up with Arpaio where they get expired, frozen prison food so that they can charge the prices that they do ( should have also been my first clue).   EVERYTHING is processed and they use the cheapest quality ingredients.  I saw \"crabettes\" and thought they might be some type of fritter. It's fried imitation crab sticks. Service was good. It's just the food that is so bad. I understand it is a family business and has been in Phoenix forever, which is super admirable. I would hope that maybe they would just try to re-invent their menu a bit. Fresh seafood for a chain like this is a lot to ask in the desert. I think maybe if they paid an extra .20 per unit, they could get a naturally formed filet of fish. I will definitely not ever go back here"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in Tempe, but decided to try the Mesa one since the line is always in the street. This place does not live up to the hype. I was disappointed in how different their shrimp and chips were but more shocked they dont carry Ranch. Who doesnt carry ranch? There are mexican and chinese food places that carry ranch. This place didnt.  Aside from I will have to make the extra drive to tempe if I want my shrimp and chip fix!"}
{"text":"This is my first and last visit. Ever since we have moved to Arizona, specifically the Phoenix Metro, people have been raving about Pete's Fish and Chips. So my husband and I decided to try it. We ordered a number 2 and the number 3 chicken strips both combo meals. Service was Speedy but not friendly. This is a cash-only place. The order was delivered quickly. And this is the best this place has to offer. We received our Combo Number 2 fish shrimp and fries. The fish patties were pre breaded pre-made Frozen, the shrimp was flat and pre breaded hard as a rock. Not my idea of fresh or good seafood. I did like the chicken strips comma but neither one of my two boys did. Tartar sauce for fish with extra was not included with the meal. The mail came with some sort of a red ketchup type sauce. I like their traditional horseradish red sauce. I was not overly impressed nor will I go back. Just not my cup of seafood."}
{"text":"Sorry, we're from Seattle, and this place wouldn't last a week there. Frozen processed fish patties are NOT fish and chips. How about fresh halibut or at least cod instead?"}
{"text":"4 stars for always being the same.  If you have never been here I am not sure what the draw would be. Lol. Unless eating fish sticks reminds you of your youth.
For me the flavor of fish and Pete's sauce brings back a lot of years of memories so I just must have it a couple times a year. Never disappoints EXCEPT by now I would think they could have figured out some way to have a restroom.   When they get one I may just make it a monthly stop. 
Fish - perfect fish stick! (1.65) Pete's sauce and coleslaw on top - yummmm.  Had the superburger (1.35) today. Much like a Whataburger.  
The guys waiting us looked less than thrilled to be there.  Not sure what that was about. But all in all same as always."}
{"text":"Apparently a Phoenix area chain with a good reputation. I had lunch here with dear papa and after eating at this one on Glendale, was astonished at how busy they were.  I think this is a fish place for people who really enjoyed their fish sticks when they were in grade school. Fries were mediocre, too. They don't even carry malt vinegar (a staple of any fish place) and the server seemed offended that I'd ask for it instead of using their very strange \"special\" sauce. The only plus is that Pete's is cheap and the service was pretty fast. I realize Phoenix is in a desert but if you want fish you're better off at Trader Joe's and making it at home."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with amazing food and quick service! The chicken nuggets,  fish and burgers were all great lots of food for little $$$!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best! Always gotta have extra sauce. 
7 piece shrimp everytime..."}
{"text":"The fish is nothing more than glorified fish sticks. The \"special\" sauce is watered down ketchup. The \"tartar\" style sauce just tastes like mayo.The staff is completely rude. And the non-refillable drinks are packed completely full with ice, so there is hardly anything in the cup to drink. 

Would have been nice to also have some regular hot sauce or lemons as options for the fish too since the sauces are so bland and mediocre. I guess the sauces are a perfect match for the bland and mediocre frozen fish rectangles and fries.

I am seriously baffled as to why it was so busy and why people ever recommend this joint to anyone. Absolutely stunned that it's been in business for so long and that people actually like it. 
I just ate there for the first and last time. Not only was everything about it terrible, but now I'm extremely sick to my stomach.

I wouldn't force my worst enemy to eat this garbage."}
{"text":"I know this is a Mesa relic and a beloved lunch spot but I was NOT impressed. The chicken nuggets are mealy and disgusting.  Weird flavor AND texture.  The fries were way over cooked and mostly brown.  My soda cup was all sticky.  The fish was surprisingly decent, flakey and light.  I didn't try the shrimp, but my daughter who normally LOVES shrimp only ate one or two so I'm assuming it wasn't spectacular.  We were all hungry an hour later because we all didn't eat much of our food.  I bought extra sauce because normally I'm a big sauce fan.  However most of our sauce went to waste.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.

I was disappointed they don't serve onion rings on Fridays.  If I'm going to eat something deep fried, all I really want is some onion rings.  So that was a big bummer.  But it's safe to say I will not be back for them.

The service was good, no complaints there.  But the food was NOT good."}
{"text":"I don't know -- I just don't love Pete's. Granted, I didn't grow up in Phoenix with the establishment as part of a tradition but, objectively speaking, Pete's offers little in terms of value or quality. Don't get me wrong, they nail the deep fried combo meals on the head but it isn't cheap and it pretty much all tastes the same (which is where their dip comes in handy. I've never had a bad experience here but it's not something I rave about either."}
{"text":"Disgusting is the only word I can think of for this food.  Perfectly square orange colored deep fried fish that makes McDonalds fish filets seems like a gourmet meal!  The only thing resembling shrimp was the fact that they formed the fried \"shrimp\" into the proper shape.  After taking one bite of fish and one of shrimp I thought at least I have the french fries to eat.  They were nasty too!  I wasn't expecting anything fancy by any means, I came her because I wanted greasy fried fish and shrimp and the only part of that I got was grease.  I just don't understand the love for this place."}
{"text":"Really? What exactly are they famous for??

After living in Glendale for about 5 years, seeing people drive around with Pete's bumper stickers, and detouring around 55th and Glendale at rush hour because the drive-through line backs up into the road, we finally tried this. In the end I just have to ask what all of their \"fans\" are thinking.

The fish that's so famous looks and tastes like something you might get from the frozen food section of the store. But only if you got the cheapest store brand possible and made sure it was a SQUARE patty of frozen breaded fish. The fish sandwich was one of the aforementioned fish patties on a cheapo hamburger bun with a smear of sauce. The fries were questionable. Honestly, I'd rather eat fish at Long John Silver's than eat here again."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food, but for the lack of customer service as a fast food restaurant.  I ordered 45.00 worth of food from them at the drive thru.   They placed 5 orders / plates of hot steaming food in ONE brown paper bag.   We also had three drinks.  Handed everything over and we drove home.  After the bag got nice and soggy on the ride home, it failed to contain our family feast and what do yo know, the lawn got some fertilizer.   Yup. Dropped most of the food.   Able to salvage one meal, I went back to the store and ordered $18 of the $45 original order to replace the kids meals. Yeah. Only the kids and my ladies meal dropped , not mine.   Right away, the young boy at the window recognized me.   He said \" did we forget something? \".  I explained that I had to come back and reorder what I dropped on the floor due to a bag they disintegrated under the immense pressure of the food that was stuffed into an undersized bag.  He apologized and went back inside to see if he could comp my meal since I already paid for it once.  5 minutes went by and after some debate , I drove away a disappointed customer.   Very very disappointed.   I know that the cost for replacement would be 1/2 to 1/3 of the actual retail cost.  So the 7-9 dollars they would have lost had made me an irate customer and I will never return again.  Sadly.  The  greed of the manager / owner has turned me away.  I will be removing my \"\"I LOVE PETE'S\"\" bumper sticker in the morning and mailing back to them.   Maybe they can resell it for $1.73 .   Good bye Greedy Pete's.  You lost a customer of 50 years since they opened on Van Buren in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh Pete's!! My absolute favorite is  the messy fish sandwich, but the burgers are really good as well. Fries & onion rings are a must (especially with the spicy Pete's sauce) and I don't know what is, but they have the best diet pepsi!"}
{"text":"In the 13 years or so I have lived here, I have never had Pete's. I've heard how addicting it is and so great. Well, I can understand that people might enjoy it but it isn't a place that will make my regular stop in list. I was nearby and a coworker wanted it, so I drove and picked it up. In a pinch, if I were starving, I'd eat it. Do I consider it a well balanced meal? Not at all. I don't think there are any fresh items offered. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure. I'm sure my son would enjoy it although, I'm glad he wasn't with me. The sauce was good, admittedly, I had to have the sauce to make it good. This is a personal choice though, I know for a fact that people love it here. Just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Been eating at Pete's for years because my Mom's loves this place. My first Pete's exp. I believe was in the early 90's at their Tempe location off of Rural & Apache by ASU. Over the years the food has only gotten better. I gotta say the Central location really has their act together folks! I drove by several times always seeing lines out front well we finally pull in & it was amazing. Food is very fresh, crunchy & inexpensive! My wife got the Shrimp & chips I got the fish n chips with lots of sauce (you gotta have lots of dipping sauce). The service is quick & efficient, just a heads up it is CASH ONLY at this location but they do have a atm on site. This place is a must eat, you will be happy, stomach on full & wiping dipping sauce off your bottom lip!"}
{"text":"So I went here with my boyfriend mainly cause he had heard it's good, but after our experience I have no idea how that could even be true. We ordered the crabettes combo which was just huge sticks of imitation crab sticks deep fried and the #2 combo which had two pieces of fish, 7 shrimp and fries. The shrimp was mainly all bread and was very bland. My boyfriend was completely grossed out by how dense and unappetizing the crabettes were. The fries were okay and the fish was probably the only thing I found edible. I will say a lot of my friends from the valley told me the one in Mesa is very good so I'll just give this place the benefit of the doubt that it's due to the location.

The good? The food didn't take long when we ordered from the window."}
{"text":"It's been years since  stopped in here.  I was looking for fish and it was handy.  The fish was fine.  I would have preferred the fries a little more crispy.  Still not a fan of their sauce but the batter on the fish has enough seasoning I don't really need a sauce.  The price was reasonable for my 3 piece lunch and in fact I would have been fine with only the 2 piece meal.  I'll be back quicker than I was last time."}
{"text":"I would subtract stars for this location. The downtown Mesa location is like another restaurant. It is almost false advertising to call this Pete's!  No messy fish sandwich?  Are you kidding me?  That's like no Big Mac at McDonald's!  Do us all a favor and close this joke of a restaurant!  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"This is the location I went to before I moved to WA, where Dick's Drive In is probably the equivalent, minus the fish. 3 stars because it's not stellar, but it's not bad. Reliable home of the Monster Burger, before Jack in the Box stole the name and put E Coli on the map. 

The service and food were always good and predictable, and I never got sick from eating at Pete's. A lot of 5 star joints can't make that claim."}
{"text":"Extremely rude coworkers!! Prices are overly too much! They don't accept cash AND you have to buy tartar sauce too ? Are you kiddn me? Never AGAIN coming back!!"}
{"text":"1st cash only and nothing bigger than a $20. There is a ATM onsite if you need to get cash. This location is always busy! Drive thru or walk up. The fish and chips is delicious. I love the Pete's Sauce. You can even buy it by the gallon. If you do not like fish they offer chicken strips, burgers and onion rings. Except they do not serve chicken on Fridays. Seating is only outside but they have misters if it is hot outside. But the weather does not prevent people from coming!!! Not open on Sunday's."}
{"text":"I don't know what happen here lately but the burritos and fries have changed for the worse. Last two visits have been awful and I always ate Pete's on a regular. Customer service always has been bad there but the food made up for it. Just horrible change, for now it's Lenny burgers for me."}
{"text":"Love Pete's! The service is always fantastic and the food is not only cheap but good! I love their simple menu. The onion rings are always great and so are the chicken strips. I wish the fries had a little more salt and the burgers were a little better, but with their prices and great service it's hard to beat. 

And the Pete's sauce? Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"If I wanted frozen fish strips. I would have stayed home and saved $12 bucks !! Worst food ever. !!!"}
{"text":"Processed fish patties?!  Why do a fish stand if you're only gonna serve that kind of stuff? I was really expecting some nice battered and fried fish, this place has been here for soooooo long. And you only take cash? This is 2014."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pete's with my family on AZ roadtrips for as long as I can remember, so I know these well:

The rules:

No  debit or credit cards
No checks
No 50s or 100s
No separate orders
No ketchup--don't even ask.
No Sundays
No feeding the pigeons
Clean up after yourself, your mother does not work here.

So bossy, so cheap, so mouth-wateringly delicious. Forget about your precious ketchup, Pete's Special Sauce knocks my socks off. Careful with parking, it can be cutthroat--especially on Fridays."}
{"text":"I can get better fish and chips in the frozen food section at Walmart. I went here for the first time today. I was told by a couple of people at work it was great! 
Absolutely not. I had the fish and shrimp . It's all over battered frozen crap that grocery stores sell. 
And the Petes sauce! Seriously. It's ketchup with a tiny bit of horseradish in it. And isn't good at all. Basically it's wanna be cocktail sauce. 
In my opinion one of the worst places I have eaten in a long time."}
{"text":"Gotta like it fried, that's what you get. Phoenix icon, been around for a long time. Be sure go bring cash, only can pay with cash. Outside dining only."}
{"text":"Super fire ,never disappoints me monster burgers and shrimp ..I can eat here everyday..."}
{"text":"Gorton's in the toaster is better than this vile crap. They charge extra for their bad tartar sauce. Avoid."}
{"text":"We have passed this place dozens of times and finally stopped in...Its terrible.  I can't image people going here more than once.  It's literally a joke.  I wish yelp was more dependable.  It seems like anything legitimate review wise is censored."}
{"text":"Went to petes to try something different. Waited 20(about)minutes total, 5 for someone to answer the drive through and 15 for food. They had a staff of 6 people that night and we were the only customers so I don't understand why it would take so long for food.  When we finally got home we realized they had shorted us on food and sauce. We deemed it not worth the trip to get this corrected."}
{"text":"Pete's Fish and Chips has a reputation for being legendary in the Phoenix valley, so of course I had to try it. And, wow, what a miss.

First of all, they had outdoor seating only, which isn't so bad I guess. Oh wait, no, we're in Phoenix, doesn't it get to be about 117 degrees F outside in the summer? Sounds like a blast.

Secondly, they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar. How on earth do you even run a fish place with no tartar sauce? Malt vinegar is a little more uncommon but for pete's (lol) sake even McDonald's has Tartar sauce.

Third, the fish itself. Speaking of McDonalds, that is what I am reminded of, this is not batter dipped and fried fillets of fish, this is minced and formed, and covered in a crunchy, crumbly breading, like what you'd find on a Mcdonald's fish sandwich.

Fourth, they only take cash. What year is it?

The red sauce they give you is OK, but it is more like a shrimp sauce, I'm sure it would be great on that. It definitely does not belong on fish.

Their Hamburgers though, are quite good and very inexpensive. If you go to Petes, get one of those. Skip the fish, it's awful. I have no idea how this place became so popular on such awful fish and chips. An Englishman would burn this place to the ground."}
{"text":".So happy they opened back up after a fire.  The food here is amazing.  I have tried most of the things on the menu over the years and have NEVER been disappointed.  the other night i got a \"daisy dog\" which was a corn dog but with the different type of batter!  

To sum it up if you want some good food, cheap, with the risk of getting killed in a drive by shooting then this is your place!  i know i will go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"They suck food was average and they didn't get our order right the employees seemed lazy"}
{"text":"No words...well, almost no words can describe this place.

I was doing my husband - a native Phoenician - a favor one evening and picked up dinner for him at Pete's Fish & Chips. He explained to me how everyone knows that it's just fish bricks, etc, but that the red sauce is on point and well, you have to be born and raised in Phoenix to \"get it.\" 

I'm going to assume that he's correct because, well, I watched them put a frozen brick of um, let's say packed fish, into a big vat of grease and then pull it out and stick it into a brown paper bag. The grease leaked through the bag and stunk up my car for a day or two. 

Honestly, I'm giving them 2 stars because of their length of time in Phoenix and being able to convince Phoenicians that what they're serving is fish and two because the drive-thru service guy was really nice."}
{"text":"Scallops were the best as we ordered all the fried seafood offers just to try. 
You do get a lot of fries, if sampling be warned.
Problem for me it all kinda tasted the same fried breading. The special sauce was ok."}
{"text":"Never again !

The fish here is as cheap as you can get, pre-fabricated fish squares that are slightly better than McDonald's filet-o-fish. The shrimp that I ordered were flat, like pounded out flat, who knows what this crap was. The fries  were limp and flavorless. The only thing that made this any better was the \"special sauce\", which I believe to be hot sauce & ketchup.

This place is SUPER cheap and the food reflects why. There is no reason I will ever eat here again, peace out Pete's !"}
{"text":"Disgusting. When a place says they sell fish and chips you dont expect to get FROZEN CHICKEN AND FISH.  The chicked tenders are frozen, not real chicken and look like McDonalds nuggets. Even have the boot shape.  The fish comes in a SQUARE. What fish is square? This place is a joke. I'd never eat there nor recomment it to anyone. EVER"}
{"text":"They only take cash and it's in a not so nice area.I'm the only one in the drive-thru yet it still takes a good 15 mins for my food.The staff look like ex-cons/trailer trash. As for the food it self it's nothing special.The fries are bland and the fish is ok.The pete's sauce is pretty much hot sauce and ketchup.Total hole-in-the wall kinda place"}
{"text":"Worst fish & chips you will ever have, the shrimp is some type of battered fish product, first and last for me, long John silvers has better food than this, the little square frozen fish with breading was tasteless, if you want tarter sauce, your going to pay for it, if you want ketchup, your out of luck, they don't have it for your fries, it's a burger joint at best that serves some fish patties similar to McDonald's fish filet party, save your money and go to elsewhere '
You'll thank me later !"}
{"text":"Pete's is one of those places I don't understand.  Growing up in Mesa, AZ, Pete's has a loyal and fanatical following.

I'm not sure why.  The fish is about as processed as you can imagine (rectangular squares of fish-like material).  The shrimp and \"crabettes\" are even worse.  

The only reason I can think of eating at Pete's is that you might want to relive the experience of bad junior high school cafeteria food (and my school had better food than Pete's).

Still, the place packs them in, and does a land office business, so I guess there is no accounting for taste..."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I had some fish and chips. This place has been my stopover for some good ol' fish and chips craving. The sauce here really compliments the chips. A fine place for satisfying yourself with good food from Pete's fish & chips."}
{"text":"good and cheep
growing up in phoenix it was the silver dollar movie drive in with pete's fish & chips for dinner to go.
a lot of great memories there."}

I have eaten Pete's since I was 6 month old 1951, it has not changed a bit. One of the last drive inn's in any where. Red & White glaring out in the hot Arizona night. It is the one thing I will always do when visiting Phoenix. The Mesa store is probably the nicest and busiest.

{"text":"You are nasty Pete, especially here in Tempe.  Fast food, that doesn't come out that fast, served by greasy staff in a greasy space."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pete's Fish and Chips for 30 years. I come here for the most delicious fast- cooked seafood in Arizona -probably the world.

\"Menu MUST Haves\"

MESSY FISH SANDWICH with cheese
       (I like the Double)
ONION RINGS
BURRITO
SEAFOOD COMBO
And of course the classic FISH AND CHIPS

For dessert, my recommendation is 
Rice Krispy Treat- you won't find a better one anywhere.
ALSO,
Pete's Sauce..... .is a family recipe, good on everything, and your only option.
Tip:  Don't ask for ketchup  because they do not offer it. 

bring CA$H because no CARDS ACCEPTED here AND no bills larger than $20s
3 WORDS- EAT at Pete's"}
{"text":"I grew up in Phx loving Pete's and several moves around the country has done nothing to dull my love of this place and it's awesome offerings.

I am in northern California now and I just can't resist the urge to head back over just to get my fix of Pete's shrimp, fish, monster burgers and their incredible sauce that just rocks. If I weren't 16 hours away I would be getting my fix a lot more often!

I envy all of you who still reside within a reasonable driving distance to a Pete's Fish & Chips location.   

I should call and see if they can ship any part of their menu up to me. At least I can wish, right?"}
{"text":"The worst fish and chips I have ever had.  Do yourself a favor...go to Fry's, buy a box of Gorton's fish fillets (the square ones) and take it home and deep fry it.  Then mix some ketchup with some cocktail sauce (NO TARTAR SAUCE....THEY DON'T HAVE TARTAR SAUCE!!) and you have the Pete's experience, and you save about $15. I can't believe people think this is good.  They make Long John Silvers seem gourmet. Dang."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY??? With a broken ATM out front.  I get it you're trying to be retro, but it's 2018 get with the program if you want more customers!"}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place gets any good reviews. The \"fish\" was absolutely disgusting. It's basically a McDonald's hashbrown with fish sauce. Not sure if the good reviews are from people who've actually had a nice piece of cod or halibut. And the \"better than tartar sauce\" sauce I paid extra for almost made me vomit. In no way did it resemble tartar sauce. I can't even describe it. Took two bites of fish, and said no I can't do this. Brought it home to my dogs and they wouldn't even eat it. Finally threw it out for the birds.
What a waste of $11.00 Sad!"}
{"text":"OK I know I am going to get flack for this but here goes. Are you freaking kidding me, no tarter?!? 

On the advise of Abu whose taste buds have now come into question, I tried Pete's yesterday. I trekked out in what felt like 500 degree heat to the ATM. Because Pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet! 

The whole time I am thinking if they are still in business after no tarter and no debit it must be good, right? Wrong. I have been tricked, hoodwinked, bamboozled, led a stray, run a muck. Just flat out deceived! 

I ordered the deluxe seafood combo 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a 32 oz drink. Which by the way did not have its price listed. I figured it couldn't be to much the regular combo has 1 less piece of fish and 3 less shrimp was only 5.95. Wrong again $9.45! Again thinking this fish must be outstanding! 

I get it home and it was still piping hot and smelled wonderful! Again with the trickery. I started with a french fry and it wasn't completely done in the middle yuck! I then moved onto what Pete describes as shrimp, really there was shrimp in there? I never tasted it and only saw some small specks of white and red inside the gross grease laden dough! UGH I had to spit it out. Even my dog left it and she has been known to eat her own poop! 

The only reason Pete's did not rate a 1 star from me is the square fish. Yes I said square, it is a square patty just like McDonald's only it does taste better than Mickey D's. I didn't care for the red sauce on my fish. The 1st piece I ate plain and the second piece I added my own tarter sauce and it was delicious. On a sidebar some of the other fries were edible and pretty tasty. 

I have yet to find a joint that can top the catfish at Honey Bears but not for lack of trying. 

Moral of this story, only get the fish and chips, make sure your chips are cooked and have tarter on the ready!

Also Lain gave me this tid bit of info... \"Pete the owner was murdered as he slept, they used a hammer and bashed his head in, just some trivia for you...\"

Yeah they bashed his head in over that shrimp and no tarter sauce!"}
{"text":"I love Pete's. Their food is good at a reasonable price. Fast service, and friendly people. The only bad thing is it is cash only, but the food and service is FAR beyond that complaint!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Pete's since I was a little girl... a long long time. I remember my mom saying \"we're going to Pete's\" and we would cheer, yaaay yummy, cheap, fast, the best in town, I just drove down there after work, 15 miles to pick up dinner, every one cheered yaaay when I walked in the door."}
{"text":"No dogs allowed according to employees that just answered saying \"uuuhhhh, nooo dogs!\" Funny since all their seating is outside ramada benching."}
{"text":"Pete's is amazing. This is more of a public service announcement than a review. Sorry, Yelp!

My husband and I went to lunch at the Pete's Fish and Chips on 27th Avenue and Van Buren in Phoenix. When we walked up to the window, there was an elderly Hispanic man standing next to the window, holding a dollar bill. He appeared to be disabled and had one of those carts with wheels and a seat which he used to walk. He spoke to my husband in Spanish, but he doesn't understand Spanish at all and I didn't understand him because he spoke fairly quickly. My husband ordered our food and we sat down. A young couple was sitting at the table next to us with their small child. The father got up and went to the man. He asked him how he can help. The old man replied, but I could not understand him still. The father then ordered food and paid for it. Meanwhile, a woman who had been sitting with her husband at another table got up and gave the elderly man some cash. He thanked her several times. The young father stood with the old man until his food arrived. He helped him put the food and beverage on his cart and the elderly man covered it with a bath towel. The elderly man went on thanking the young man and (I think) blessing the young child. The father hugged the old man and the family left. The other couple left shortly thereafter. At first, I thought that was such a sweet thing to have happened to this poor, crippled, elderly man and felt it was such a good thing to see people helping someone to obtain a basic necessity.
But then...
The old man walked down to the light and crossed south across Van Buren and then headed back east toward the bus stop across from Pete's. He met up with two younger men; probably in their late twenties, early thirties. He spoke to them and handed them two plates of food and the drink. (Remember, I witnessed the father buy him ONE plate of food...) They talked for a bit while the young men ate the food. The old man then gave one of them cash and he ran back across Van Buren to the Circle K. He emerged shortly with a bag in his hand and ran back over to the man. He handed the elderly man the bag from which the elderly man took out a large can of beer and started drinking it. The bus arrived and the two young men got on it and left. As of right now, the old man is still across the street drinking his beer. What is left of the food is sitting on a half-wall next to him- he hasn't touched it. 
I am writing this in hopes that at least one of two things happens: The man can no longer run this scam because people who read this will be aware of it and/or Someone will help him find resources where he can get his needs met another way besides scamming people into feeling bad for him and buying him food out of the kindness of their hearts. Shame on him. Karma is a red-eyed bitch, sir. And she is watching you very closely."}
{"text":"First time here had to go the through the line three times, I'll take the blame for not having cash as they only take certain cash for orders. By the last round my 11 month soon was screaming his head off all because the manager couldn't add one item to my order which took less than a pump break to get from the order speaker to the window. I think I'll pass on this message location."}
{"text":"Food is okay- it's Panko breaded not beer battered (although I didn't really expect beer anywhere near the temple). The prices are pretty steep considering the quality of food. The fish was cooked perfectly but the shrimp was dry. Not worth it at all, and it was very crowded when I went. There were a ton of people all dressed up and it was chaotic. There was literally hundreds of kids there. (Maybe there was an event at the Temple?). Also, bad service."}
{"text":"My husband got the shrimp and I got the crabettes:

Fried Shrimp - delicious! Great breading and fried to perfection.

Fried Crabettes - STAY AWAY! I actually really like imitation crab (I know, weird)...so when I ordered it I was expecting it to be imitation crab. But it just didn't taste right. The first bite was maybe okay, but I really didn't like it much after that. I will stick to keeping my imitation crab in crab louie salads and California rolls :P

The fries that came with both of our entrees were decent. Nothing special, just good fries.

I'll have to get the shrimp next time, or try the fried fish. I should have just went with the fish, but I'm a sucker whenever I see crab on a menu."}
{"text":"Duh It's Pete's are you not from around here? Go ask another reviewer what they think and then come back here so you can see \"I told you so!\""}
{"text":"Good food. However I am not a fan of the fish. It looks and tastes like 4 fish sticks stuck together. I'm sure that is not the case, however it's my perception. Personally I would go for the chicken tenders, I'm sure they may be frozen but they come out juicy and look normal.
It is cash only but fortunately for you and them there is a bank within walking distance(500ft). Just be ready for a wait as that is the usual there, but it's never very long. Fun place to try out."}
{"text":"Came here when I was out visiting some folk in the desert and thought this place was ok. I don't really like fish and chips but they had plenty of options for me to chose from. I got the chicken strips and was a little disappointed. I kind of thought that a fish and chips place would also have good strips but I was wrong. I don't think that they were much better than something I would get at Jack n Box. I did however try one of my buddies jumbo fried shrimp. Mmmm good."}
{"text":"If you feel comfortable being surrounded by diabetic sparrows, gang tattooed pigeons, piranha flies, tasteless mustard pickle hamburgers, limp Grade B fries and a spicy hot slick tasting red sauce, this is your kind of place. I pity the customer that said \"\"Kinda funny going to a fish and chips joint just for the monster burger\", guess he has never tried an IN & Out Double Burger with all the trimmings. Guess I should have just ordered the fish and gone somewhere else for fries, ketchup. If you are going to order a drink, make sure you tell them NO ice since you want be getting a refill when they load you drink with ice and 1/2 cup of soda. Who doesn't do drink refills these days?  Pete's!."}
{"text":"For a fish and chips place you think they could at least get that right...

My boyfriend and I came here on a recomendation without even looking at the reviews. BIG MISTAKE! If I would have checked Yelp first we would not have gone. Totally agree with everyone here. The food is bland frozen brand, didn't come out all that hot, and the fries were 100% not salted. Not lightly salted, there was no salt. And you don't get any tartar sauce with your fish, just some spicy cocktail sauce. But even the sauce cannot cover up how bland the food is. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum! Yes it's cash only but read the million signs they have that explain it people ;) I get the 2pc fish and chips and love it! It's delicious! Get an extra cup of tarter sauce though. You'll run out! I can't vouch for anything else on the menu because hey, if it aight broke... The drive thru line can be quite lengthy. I've waited 30 minutes in the line before (I know right??) but it's worth it. Great little joint. Go check it out"}
{"text":"This is the worst fish & chips I've ever had. All batter with very little fish, flavorless. How do you have this without Tartar sauce, Vinigar or Lemons. They give you a extremely watered down excuse for cocktail sauce, horrible. Don't waste your time or money, go to the store and get fish sticks, their actually better!"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars I would. Awful awful awful! What a waste of my time and money. Ordered the 4 piece shrimp and chips & 2 piece fish 7 shrimp, ended up with 3 pieces of fish and 9 shrimps that were so completely covered in their breaded stuff you couldn't even enjoy the shrimp. I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood combo. The fish was pretty good, as were the chips. The 4 pieces of shrimp, however, were bad. The batter covering them was way too thick and completely masked the flavour of the shrimp.I would never have known they were fried shrimp if you hadn't told me. Dissapointing. Stick to the fish if you go there and maybe the sandwiches (I haven't tried those but a fried told me they're not bad)"}
{"text":"Out Christmas shopping with my boys and have always thought of stopping by Pete's.  I've driven through Glendale many times in the last 27 years and it's always fascinated me how many people were there. That big of a crowd, it must be A) Inexpensive, B) Awesome, C) Unique...

I'll give them A as we ordered 3 x 2 piece fish and chips, but hesitate to call the $1.80 for a soda inexpensive based on convenience store prices.

Loved the look of the fish patties, square and crunchy, not that oily looking.  They were very thin and mostly crust.  When tasting without the sauce they were bland.  With the sauce, which may be the best thing about Pete's, they were quite good.  For a two piece fish meal with fries (thin, shoestring) you get a tiny little container of red sauce (not ketchup and not cocktail sauce, but something like spicy ketchup) that isn't enough to flavor everything, but you can buy another small container for 10 cents or so (or up to 14 oz for a little more).  The fries were under salted which isn't bad based on different people's taste, but lack of salt packets (or catchup or other condiments) readily available (some available behind counter if you wait in the line again) was a pain.

The two stars are because fish n chips don't appear to be their strong suit, or miss the mark of my expectations of some type of east coast or English fish and chips.  This isn't the type of place you are going to sit down with a bottle of malt vinegar and dip your beer batter fish or steak cut fries into.

The number of stars is also for the number of birds that are all over that want to take your food or at least stare you down as you a re eating. No one cleaning tables during the time I was there.  I'm also not a fan of cash only places with an ATM machine out front to charge me on their end and my banks end.

Now, I didn't have their shrimp or chicken or anything other than described above, but there are always a lot of people out there that must love something about Pete's.

After re-reading their menu on the internet and being somewhat taken back by having to purchase extra sauce I have to question their math abilities:

\"Pete's Special Sauce made fresh daily
2 oz. - .10
5 oz. - .30
8 oz. - .60
14 oz. - .95\"

Someone please tell me this is a joke because 7 x 2oz containers (14 oz) would only be .70 as opposed to .95?!?! Definitely has to be a joke, but almost worth dropping the rating to one star."}
{"text":"It is Arizona, would you rather them lie and say caught today? From Boston, so i get it's not caught that day and its not fresh. For the price it really isnt that bad. One of the few places I'll actually get seafood, unless paying an arm and leg for fresh stuff."}
{"text":"This is kind of a quirky place (outside dining only, cash only, no restrooms) but it's worth it for the sauce and the food (and for me to say a place with no restrooms is worth it is saying something). This reminds me that I haven't been there in awhile. There's a reason I have a \"I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips\" bumper sticker on my truck."}
{"text":"WARNING - Not fit for human consumption!!! 

Wholly shitz what a disappointment. My UK friend and I decided to go there for lunch to check it out.  Neither one of us held our breath very much for it but never the less... We did not expect bland frozen square fish product patties with equally nasty previously frozen tasteless fires. Yes, they are not chips per say, just yeacky french fries. 
1st stop as we got back to the office was bathroom and even now my stomach unhappily rumbles under the desk. Down boy, down! It will pass with time. 

Disgusting all around. Possibly even insulting. 

PS: And WTF is up with not taking credit cards? Scamming \"The man\"?"}
{"text":"If I had to list them in order... 27th Ave location is #1 for service, prep time, and taste.  And, I like the location. What?! You don't?! 

Apache Rd. is not consistent, sometimes the shrimp is cold, sometimes the fries are cold. Depends on your lucky day. But they are convenient!

Now, I just have finish my rounds and visit all the other locations again to complete my rating chart. 5 foam-fishes to the best location!  A Pete's marathon weekend. Anyone want in on this?"}
{"text":"Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. I've eaten at Pete's since I was a little kid- and had the chance to recently stop in as an adult to \"re taste\" their Monster Burger! Still the same- some may be turned off by the blandness but I'm saying \"YEAH\" based on nostalgia and the soft place in my heart for Pete's Sauce (think of a watery, spicy version of ketchup)!! 

Newcomers may be turned off by the shabby decor, outside-only dining, and cheap-o exterior but this is truly a great greasy spoon for burger, fish, shrimp and chips.

The prices are right- 4 piece shrimp and chips for $4, monster burgers for less than $2, and cheap sodas (Pepsi products). Please remember this location (and most all Pete's locations) is CASH ONLY. Expect some lines in both the walk-up order window and drive-thru. 

You can grab your free bumper sticker when you order- display it proudly!"}
{"text":"I knew this place had poor reviews before Yelp was even around but was in the area in search of food. I improvised and went to one of the first places nearby.

I ordered a combo that was 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a drink.  Came out to just under $10.  For price comparison, the same thing at Long John Silver would be $5-6.

The shrimp were flat out awful.  They butterfly the shrimp to make it look bigger and then overload it with heavy batter before frying it.  I removed one of the shrimp from the breading and noticed it was probably 10 times smaller than the amount of batter used.  They use realllllly small shrimp, like 50-100 ct used in cheap shrimp cocktail platters at the grocery store.  

The fries are below average.  If you are going to have \"chips\" in your name, you need to have some of the best fries around.  They do not.  

 Their fish was okay because it wasn't overly greasy but again their breading is so thick and heavy it ruins it.  Fried fish should have a light batter.  In fact, nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use.  To top it off, their fish is served in the most natural of shapes.... a square.  If I want awkward looking fish, I'll head to the frozen section and get some fish sticks.
  
I saved the worst for part of the meal for last.  Their signature sauce.  That stuff was awful.  It tasted like it was 50% water and 45% ketchup and 5% vinegar.  They don't give you any tartar sauce, no malt vinegar and nickel and dime you for sauces on the menu.  I figured some other staples for this type of meal would be included but I was wrong.  I didn't even get to drown the bad food in a decent sauce, it was just more mediocrity.  

On to the most obvious quirk about the place, cash only.  If you are a cash only joint I assume you are trying to save the fees associated with accepting them and keeping your prices down.  Then why is the food so expensive?  It certainly isn't high quality.  It certainly isn't any good.  

Bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = 1 star."}
{"text":"Just. Simply. Discusting. 

The worst fish and chips I every had. I only went cause it was my wife's spot when she was a kid but never again will I step foot near this place again. The fries, onion rings, fish where just gross.  Over fried and no taste. Only decent thing would be the shrimp and sauce thag they have. 

Oh and remember your own rag to clean your own table and bring your own napkins too."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Pete's. We were in downtown Glendale checking out some thrift shops yesterday and we started getting pretty hungry. We walked by Pete's, and it smelled pretty good. I remembered hearing good things about the place, so I thought we'd give it a try! Also, my uncle's (who still lives in London) name is Pete, so I thought that was kind of neat. Now, with much of my family being English, of course I like fish and chips! ;)

The fish was actually quite good, in my opinion! Or maybe we were just very hungry... The prices were a bit high for a *cash only* little place, but not too bad. Just higher than what I was expecting. The pieces of fish were actually not that big either, but that's okay too. The chips (fries) were decent, nothing special. The sauce was good too, but I can't believe there was no malt vinegar! Or tartar sauce, but I don't use that anyway. The outdoor seating wasn't a problem because we just drove through and took it with us to go. No way were we going to sit outside in 115 degree weather and eat fish! :P

The drinks were large and decently priced, but I had the plain unsweetened iced tea and it was almost flavourless. It basically tasted like lovely Arizona tap water with a vague taste of tea somewhere in there. My friend got a Diet Coke with no ice, and they were happy to do so. Nothing special there, so moving on! The drive through was pretty quick, but it was very difficult to understand them through the speaker. The volume was a bit low or something, and there was also a communication issue with the person on the other end. Different accents and all that.

Overall, not a terrible experience, but we didn't stick around for too long. Prices were decent, but I would expect cheaper from this place. I would probably go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. Maybe I'll check out another location sometime and see how they compare? :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Went here after Glendale Glitters. I was hesitant because I always regret eating there but not this time. I had a corn dog kids meal with lots of red sauce!"}
{"text":"NO WAY. 

Dry, fishy smelling, square fish & chips.
This is not even close to being edible.
I would seriously recommend a McDonald's fish sandwich over this crap any day.
A disgrace to fish and chips.
Especially if this is supposed to be your restaurant's specialty. Pathetic"}
{"text":"Those giving glowing reviews obviously never had fish and chips. The fish and chips I know doesn't come from the frozen food section of Safeway, and the frozen French fries that I put in the oven are better. And no tartar sauce - that would at least have made it somewhat palatable.  Never ever again!!!  Can I give it a minus star?"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, if I wanted Square fish I would've gotten a fish sandwich from McDonald's or went to the Safeway and purchase frozen Gordon's fish and fry it at home which taste the same. Then there was not tater sauce who serves fish with out tarter sauce. Now let's talk about the shrimp which looked like chicken tenders which also has no taste, and what is this red special sauce taste like katsup that was watered down. I don't know if it's because I am from the east cost, bet there has to be a better place the petes"}
{"text":"My favorite dive for good chicken strips! You cannot beat it! I could DRINK the Pete's sauce!!! Just give me a straw!!! I can't say much for the fish-- I don't eat the stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I really like Pete's. I only give it 4 stars because they are run down dives and the fries aren't my favorite but I really like the fish and I could practically drink the sauce. It's true that this isn't your typical fish and chips and I think that's why some are disappointed. The coating on the fish is not a batter but has a kind of crumbly, crunchy exterior that happens to really soak up the sauce, which is a good thing. 
It's a dive that's been around since the 40's with a long line of people everyday for lunch and dinner; they must be doing something right!  Just don't expect beer batter halibut for $20, this is inexpensive, tasty, crunchy goodness on a paper plate. 
I know I'm not the only one out there that loves Pete's!  I go there every time I visit Mesa."}
{"text":"Great for what it is! A simple fish and chips joint. Cash only. Outside seating only, but it is shaded and has misters. They only have 2 sauces: their original sauce, which I wasn't too fond of, it reminded me of a cocktail sauce and \"awesome sauce\" which is suppose to be like a tartar but kind of missed the mark. Next time I'll get it to-go and use my own sauce. Will return though, can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"This place was a super big let down. Frozen fish squares? Cold unsalted fries? Flat pop? Frozen burger patties? And a burrito that looked like someone just popped open a banquet meal and pulled one out. The banquet would probably be better. Should have known the universe was trying to tell me to leave when they only take cash. It's the 21st century. Get with it. If you are looking for a better fish sandwich you'll have better luck at mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Wow this place is terrible. To start things off drive-through older woman that took care of us was absolutely horrible. Apparently she couldn't hear me and had me come to the window and then asked me what do you want. Really!  Not very friendly at all. In fact pretty darn right rude.  When I asked her about the fish she said well we are Pete's Fish and chips assuming that they were probably good I ordered a five piece fish and chips that by the way does not come with tartar sauce. That is extra ( and definitely not very good ). I also ordered a two piece fish and chips and a five piece scallops and chips. Final cost $24 and some change. Oh my God I think I've been robbed. Started on the drive home and decided to eat my scallops and my boyfriend was eating his fish well after laughing at him profusely about how they were just fish sticks or fish patties. Same thing only bigger you just know they came out of a box terrible terrible tasting. I bit into my extremely raw  scallop. Oh how I wanted to go back I was just so angry. Everyone of my five scallops were raw. Wonder if the health department would want to know about that. Well I hope that many people read this and know not to eat at Pete's I know the sign says eat at Pete's trust me just don't. Save your money.  


Today is December 20 I just wanted to add to My review   Ate there yesterday December 19, wasn't feeling very good after I ate that raw scallop. And still not feeling well today. Thinking about calling and talking to management shouldn't have to be going through this upset stomach. Constant bathroom breaks at work somethings not right. I did not eat anywhere else except for there yesterday. Please be careful folks."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about Pete's Fish and Chips, so had to give it a try. I went after work, however noticed in the drive thru line that it said \"cash only\" and no $50 or $100 bills. Unfortunately, all I had was a card on me, so just went home instead. Determined to try it, I went the next day and tried the Seafood Combo Platter that included 2 fish, 7 shrimps, and fries. The menu was very large and had various items. It was delicious for fast food seafood! The shrimp was huge, fish was large square-shaped, and the portion size was very large! It could easily be shared among two people. I was also happy to see that they had Horchata. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok just a bit of history the first time I went to Petes was 1966, went alot in High School and then evening before shipping off to bootcamp in 1971 my last meals was a petes number 2! When I got out of boot camp and was home on leave, yep you guessed it i had a number 2 as a return meal! Over the years i would stop here when I would come to town to visit my family and the first time I had been back in a long time  was two days ago!

So what did I order? A number two with iced tea! It was so good, two slabs of fried fish, seven large shrimp fried, and a super lot of fries and a massive tea, yes I was so happy!!!!

Now I might be one of the few but im a tartar sauce guy and Petes special sauce is good and all but i still like tartar sauce! However i tried the sauce and it was still as good as I remember. 

The service thru the drive thru was quick and Bubbles, the young girl taking our order, was so nice and sweet. I swear the more she talked there appeared more butterflies and unicorns!

When she found out I was from SC and hadn't been here for a long time she gave me an extra Petes sauce no charge!

I do miss the old days when Petes was a wooden shack but the place has a nice outdoor sitting area with misters and a pretty decent restroom!

Why four stars? Well this might seem silly to some but i had to pay for tartar sauce! Anyway i like petes. Its fast, cheap and FRIED!!!!! Hurrah!!!"}
{"text":"Drive through times are horrible. No traffic yet 30 min for one order. Im so angry that i just worked a full day and tried to patron a local place and they totally blew me off. Horrible meal times, horrible service. The only reason theres 2 stars is because of the food."}
{"text":"First off don't expect to get fancy fish and other seafood when you get food here. I know it is fish and chips. Don't expect to get condiments like tartar sauce and a lemon wedge either. I highly recommend their chicken tenders. Their signature sauce is Pete's sauce it's essentially hot sauce and ketchup. It is really good for fries and dipping anything they make really. 

Come prepared with cash they're cash only. They have an atm. If you like greasy spoon type places this place is for you. If you don't like what they offer or whatever to somewhere else. They're a local institution for a reason. 

I love Pete's and always return when I get a craving for chicken tenders and fries."}
{"text":"I had been here a couple of times while I went to school at SWIHA across the street. What a waste. I'm not really sure why people drive around with Pete's Fish & Chips bumper stickers and why people rave about it, or why anyone would give this place more than 2 stars because it's awful. Absolutely awful!

First off, it's over priced for what you get and you're getting frozen food! NOTHING is made fresh. You get frozen square pieces of fish, frozen shrimp, frozen fries, frozen, frozen, frozen. You'd be better off going to your grocery store, buying it cheaper there and cooking it at home. It's sad when Long John's Silver's actually beats out someone in fish and chips. Plus even after they cook they're frozen fish squares it doesn't taste good. Its greasy and bland. Also the red sauce...yeah it's gross. I wanted tarter sauce and was told no.

Second, service is appalling! Why are they so damn rude? The people servicing are disrespectful and always love shutting the little screen door in your face. They also don't accept credit cards, or debit cards. Really? Come on, catch up! The first time I came here I had to leave and go to Wendy's because I don't carry cash. So I had to try again another time, That was my first experience. There is no excuse to not accept cards nowadays; Geez, you can accept cards on smart phones, it's that easy!!!

Lastly, hygiene. Ugh...gawd...gross. This place has got to be breaking alot of health codes. Their staff looks dirty, they constantly handle money with the same gloves they use to prepare food. Plus, I have seen staff go on cigarette breaks using the same gloves they use to prepare food.

Just take your business elsewhere. Just listen to the majority of the people who have given reviews, most of them are NOT good because this place is terrible."}
{"text":"Been a lover of Pete's my whole life, since I was born & raised here. However, the crew at this location are incredibly rude and slow. Our order is never correct and we usually end up waiting a really long time for it to be wrong & incomplete. Skip this location if you can. Sorry to say but it isn't worth dealing with them, no matter how much you love Pete's."}
{"text":"This place is for drunk people with the munchies. Or people with a serious lack of fresh fruits & veggies. Either way Pete's knows what crowd it appeals to and serves them without overcharging. Seriously this place is less than most fast food \"dollar menus.\" 

Yes it is all fried and dripping with grease, but if you don't want to eat it there is a Pita Jungle right across the street. You came here for a reason. To spoil yourself rotten. 

The fish sandwich is quite good, fries remind me almost of McDonald's before they changed their method and resources. 

I will be back to bravely try the coleslaw and perhaps a burger.

Customer service tops most other places in the valley, they are friendly and aren't afraid to be honest about the less than impressive items on the menu. I also asked for a free bumper sticker and was given a pencil, magnet, and take away menu in the bag. Talk about going above and beyond!

I love the heaters when you sit down to eat, they are so warm even the table and benches stay toasty."}
{"text":"Well if u been in Arizona 4 over 5 or more years. U have heard of this place. This is a famous old time place 4 the locals. Loved by many.

Way cheaper than any McDonald. Hot and ready 2 eat.so if ur a local I will c u there. U can't go wrong with what ever u order. And the one 
One in Mesa cash only.yup. only cash.tell a friend."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here sober until last night. How is this place in business with multiple locations throughout the valley? I'm at loss for words to really describe how terrible the food is. 

And they've got the nerve to be expensive."}
{"text":"I love me some Pete's fish & chips. Either Mesa or Tempe location. Inexpensive & tasty. Always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Fish was OK but nothing special and sauce was some kind of watery ketchup plus something hot.  French fries were ordinary.  Onion rings were the worst I've ever tasted - almost all breading and tough as nails.  Fried shrimp were very tough and tasteless.  Didn't try the chicken or burgers and won't be back.

Adding to the misery was no inside seating and the misters were not up to the 109 temp on a summer's eve."}
{"text":"i've eaten at Pete's for 30 years...can beat their 'Pete's' sauce, it's awesome, and without the sauce the food isn't that great. the quality has gone up and down thru the years. i'm not sure why, i guess maybe management? same with the service. they have pretty much owned the corner of Mesa Dr and Main St, so i think they take for granted that people will go there no matter how rude the staff is and how bad the food is. Ok, it's not AWFUL, but it's not really seafood, it only vaguely resembles it.
so here are reasons to find another place to eat:
1. they only take cash. what? really? i've eaten food from FOOD TRUCKS that accept credit cards...
2. they don't accept bills over a twenty...what if 4 people have an order of say $40? nope! better have your twenty dollah bills y'all
3. they only have outdoor seating. even when it's 115 degrees outside, or raining.
4. there are no restrooms. what restaurant doesn't have restrooms? guess you better not eat there if you have the little ones with you...
5. they EXPECT you to clean up after yourself. and they have it POSTED! (your mother doesn't work here) for this reason, i usually leave my plates, cups and napkins on the table when i leave. i know that may be rude, but how else can you ensure that those tables are being cleaned like they are supposed to be??
6. lastly they are not open on Sundays. most places these days are open 7 days a week. i respect that they do not open on Sundays, it's family values and all...but that just gives the general public the chance to find a place to eat that is actually worth their time and money.

my summation: i only go to Pete's when i'm in a hurry, am driving thru the area, have cash in my pocket, and there isn't any other alternative. which is very, very seldom..."}
{"text":"On the first visit, I was the fourth car in line and waited 30 minutes for my food. Decided to give the place one more try. Unbelievably, I was the third car in line and waited 35 minutes! I actually got out of the car and went to the front window. I said I was still the second car in line and have been waiting over 30 minutes. The first two females just looked at me then two men stood there and said nothing. Finally a female comes and I tell her my concern. She says sorry for the wait, the cook had to leave for a little while because the owner called in an order? I went to my car thinking never again will I come to this place."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  This place is my favorite.  Sucks that it's Cash only however not having to pay credit card fees is probably why we're able to eat cheap fried foods.  This place is nice and friendly. My kids love eating here.  Cannot pass it up :)"}
{"text":"The reviews do not lie about this place. The fish literally tastes like it came out of a box and was heated in a microwave. If you are ever craving fried fish, do not count on this place. 

It is terrible and I have no clue how they stay in business."}
{"text":"The Shrimp and Chips are the best here!  Make sure you get a large order of Shrimp.  And a large side of their amazing Shrimp sauce because YOU will run out with the little bit they give you.  A large Root Beer and you're SET!  

Down sides of the place - They take CASH Only and many times at this Mesa location they seem trashy, rude, and communication is frustrating because they do NOT understand English. 

P.S.  Even though the Drive Through line is long, for the Best service and quality go during lunch hours."}
{"text":"People who rate this place poorly are probably not fans of fish and chips. If you want fried frish and french fries with a good sauce to dip them in then this is the place for sure. If you want a lavish meal similar to having smoked salmon along side delicately prepared potatoes, then you're at the wrong place."}
{"text":"Line was long

Food taste frozen

No salt on fries 

Half the soda is broken

Just avoid this place I'm general"}
{"text":"It is what it is... ah, working mans fry shack. Beautiful. 
It's a bunch of hot fried fish cakes and smok'in hot fry's. Perfect. 
Yah, there's some sandwiches(fried) and some sides but we all go for the fish...right?
Service is quick at both the drive thru and walk up window. 
Prices are dead on! Won't clean your wallet out just to get a bite. So bring your change they don't do cards. 
This is for every going to be a must stop when visiting.
Last words...simple is better here."}
{"text":"For more or worse a 2 star rate simply put do not waste yur time with this place I went here with the expectation ( that's the prob) that it would be awesome from here say (word of mouth) that it was to be delish lol well I got the shrimp sticks that where dipped in batter. upon first taste (I was hungry) thought it was fine second big bite was all batter so I decided to open this shrimp stick  ... Low and behold to my  surprise it was lol a sliver literally of shrimp and all batter it was horrible not to mention the square fish sandwich I got was fine I must admit bit disappointing due to the shape of ..it reminded me of a cheap 1cent patty from something they'd serve yu in a concentration camp in Russia or Cambodia oh and the fries tasted like oiled up 2cent fries ..yet they charge a ridiculous amount of dough to eat this mess I'd pass always and forever .. They serve yu rolled up cornmeal sticks lol cheap bastards"}
{"text":"I mean as a staple of Mesa dining, you know what you're going to get. Something fried. And sauce. All the sauce.

 I am partial to their tarter sauce which I could eat on its own. But it's not going to be handmade fish filets, or shrimp scampi, so if you come knowing that you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"If you like your food fried, then this is the place.  I never venture inside anymore because I'm afraid of slipping on the accumulated decades of lard and vegetable oil.  If they find a detergent powerful enough to clean it up, I will know that the end is nigh.

Everything at this place is deep fried, even the cheeseburgers.  It is all delicious, except strangely for the fries, which are below average.  

If you would have asked me to rate Pete's 15 years ago, they would have received an extra star, but with the state my arteries are in today, I just can't pull the four star trigger."}
{"text":"I have heard about Pete's and had always wanted to try it.

I happened to be waiting across the street for a bus, so I decided today was the day.

I should have caught the bus.

It wasn't BAD food, but it was a long way from what I'd imagined.

The fish isn't even something unique; it's frozen patties, deep fried and served. The chips (french fries) are also frozen. Blech!

They provide some ketchup-based sauce (ostensibly) for dipping. I asked for tartar sauce and was told it was $0.35 for 2 oz or $0.70 for 4 oz. (What a bargain)

I declined.

The fish and fries were not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but for $5 bucks I would like more than frozen fish patties and frozen fries thrown into hot fat and chunked on a plate.

I won't be paying Pete a return visit anytime in the near future.

As an aside; this particular location (I can't speak for other locations) has outdoor seating. Only. Today was a nice day and sitting outside was nice.

But there are no restrooms available.

Save your money for better quality food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I must have a foggy college memory because this food simply is not as good as I thought it was when I went to Arizona State.  The fries were bland and tasteless, the shrimp was....I don't even know, and the fish is very much akin to what you would find between two buns and slathered in tartar sauce at a certain drive through with Golden Arches.
And how do people think this is cheap?!  I ordered a kids meal, an adult meal, and an order of chicken tenders to the tune of $19.  That is not cheap!
The only joy I found in the bland food is the sauce.  It's apparently a specialty that is only available there.  The sauce is delish, but the sauce really should not be the only source of flavor in a meal, and that is the biggest problem here,"}
{"text":"We tried the combo #2, which was 2 fish, 4 fried shrimp, fries, and a soda. I started with the shrimp and my first thoughts were positive - these are good fish, I can see why Pete's been around for more than 60 years! But then I tried the fish, and it was like fishstick quality, and I was expecting a proper piece of fish. The fries were soggy but at least they were warm. For the price, you're better off with the fish + chips from Red Robin, at least they use actual filets of cod, and the fries are bottomless."}
{"text":"I vacillated between 1 and 2 stars for Pete's. In the end I decided on 2, but that is probably only because I was so hungry from a morning of construction work that I would've eaten nearly anything. When I think of real Fish and Chips, I think of what I had in London. This isn't what I had in London. This is what I ate in college during lent--store bought cheap fish patties. The shrimp weren't good either; tasted extremely fishy. The fries were soggy and bland.

I realize this is a fast food place, but I was hoping for something more than that. I'd honestly rather eat at Long John McGreaseball's."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see how many bad reviews this place got, I mean I am not stupid, the food is greasy, soggy and not that great, but they've been around for ages so they must be doing something right, I mean someone likes their food, lots of someone's. I'll be honest, when I got to Arizona one of the first places I went was Pete's Fish and Chips, it's like an institution in Glendale. I always get the fried scallops and the fried burrito. Dipped in red sauce (Tabasco and ketchup) they go down nice. I've had the burgers and I'll never have them again. When I graduated from Dysart High School one of the things I didn't miss we're their cafeteria burgers, I sure as heck ain't gonna pay good money to eat the same burger from Pete's. The fries are good and the red sauce really does go on anything, not that you really have a choice in dips, red sauce comes with every meal. The orange soda is nice and fizzy and the cherry icees are nice and cold. It is pretty annoying that they only take cash, but the regulars already know to bring cash with them. The employees aren't the most responsive of workers, but that is something you come to expect with these old and set in their way type of joints. After I eat at Pete's I feel fat and greasy and don't even want to think about the food for about a week, but after that I am right back there with $10 I one hand and a roll of napkins in the other. I can't hate on Pete's Fish and Chips and I can't talk badly about them because I know I'll always be back and would be sad if they ever went away. \"Quick, here comes the food inspector, put your gloves on, pull your hairnets over your hair, and for gods sake pull your pants up!\""}
{"text":"Was expecting something remotely resembling fish n chips...I have traveled to many coastal places in my childhood and past and remember the exquisiteness of real flaky cod filets and hearty potatoes. Run from the weird square \"fish\" chunks and less than sub-par not even fit for grocery store shelves \"chips\"!"}
{"text":"That was the worst fish & chips I have ever had!  The fish was so dry & there was little of it. Yet the breeding was thick & heavy. Like eating cardboard. The onion rings were tasteless, also covered with the thick dry breading.  At first I thought they forgot the onions. The only good thing was the fries and even they needed salt. 
The very worst part is they only take cash & that they don't tell you until you look at the print at the very bottom of the menu after you have already ordered. 
Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Some of the best shrimp and chips I have ever had. I've been coming here since I was little and every time I come back to town I always stop here. The shrimp is always good and the sauce is delicious. Definitely going to buy some sauce to go before I leave town again"}
{"text":"Nothing ever comes close to this place! Best fish and shrimp! I grew up on petes and the special sauce is AMAZING! Even there burgers are delish!!!"}
{"text":"I normally go to the Pete's in Mesa. Work down the road from this Pete's. They did not disappoint! The food was great and the service was great as well. I don't see how everyone has so many complaints. Yes the area is really sketchy but it's south Phoenix. I will continue to come here as long as I work in the area. They do NOT accept cards. CASH ONLY. I almost forgot."}
{"text":"Quite simply heroin with fins served just for you.
Yes it's that good. 
It will make you want to come back and not have that ugh feeling after eating there."}
{"text":"Huh. Maybe I've been spoiled living by the ocean most of my life, but this is average fish & chips at best. I came here with a small group of people and decided to try a little of everything.

All I'm gonna say is this: frozen stuff you can buy at the store and make with less grease than what you get here.  I should have known better than to expect good fish & chips or even real crab.  But undercooked scallops and twice as much breading as there were shrimp, I was truely disappointed.  The fries were soggy and all in all, I could just feel my arteries clogging eating this.  

I did give it an extra star because the staff was friendly, but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"A simple fish fry spot. I had the fish sandwich when I would go to mcdonalds that what I ordered no sauce and no cheese so this was like five star .. the special sauce was like catsoup hotsauce and squeeze of Lemon juice. It was tasty  I even ate the fries with it. 
You won't disappointed whatever you do just don't feed the birds."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but for the price I paid, I would much rather purchase my own processed freezer fish sticks because that is what they taste like. Before my absolute last visit here, I ate here several years ago and could swear I ate filets, not perfectly squared fish sticks. The staff was very pleasant which I always appreciate, but damn, my hungry stomach was sad to see what was placed in front of me. I'm sorry but I definitely will not be coming back. Boo."}
{"text":"Love Pete's! Not a big fan of their fish so the shrimp and chips basket is my go to order. A little disappointed in today's experience cause I ordered and paid for a small pink sauce and never got it, but I got 8 shrimp in my 7 piece meal so I guess that kinda made up for it. Overall though, I love Pete's, will always be one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"It was decent, the service was fast. I like the South side location better. The tartar sauce here was a little bland compared to the other location and the sandwich which comes with secret sauce was ok. Three stars because of the service."}
{"text":"I love this place, the fish sandwiches are pretty awesome! They only take cash and the neighborhood is not that great but it's worth it for the food!"}
{"text":"Rolled up to the drive through with a $50 and was respectfully declined (and this was on a $27 dollar tab)......So I respectfully split and drove away. Get with the times people....debit / credit cards are used by most these. 

However, I can not judge the food. I'll return someday, but not going out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Went here for 1st time last week..was very disappointed was not expecting pre patty fish they don't even offer vinegar or hot sauce. If I try again maybe diff location ...maybe they are popular for something else on menu other than the tareleas fish patty.looking for better place to have fried fish in the mean time.1star for passing as a fish and chips spot all these  years."}
{"text":"I figured that since I'm going on a diet I might as well enjoy a decadent meal loaded with fat, calories, and cholesterol.

This is certainly not fine dining, but it's mighty tasty with the fried shrimp, chicken fingers, and french fries. 

 Frankly, it's one of the better options in the area.

P.s. If you see the stray kitty drop him a few scraps"}
{"text":"My brother flies in from California just to go to Petes! If you're counting calories, hate fried food(especially seafood), or want ketchup with your fries; keep on driving! If you're down for some delicious fried fish, don't care about the calories, and want to try the top secret Petes sauce, this is the place! Yes, I feel guilty after tearing through a 4 piece fish and chips, but I don't care. It's so worth it! Just plan on an extra hour in the gym, or another mile on your run. This place is a Mesa staple and has been around forever! Convenient location and plenty of parking. It can be slammed on the weekends and there's not a lot of seating. So, you may have to take it to go. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and it sucked! We will not be back! Their fish is frozen squares that you can get at any grocery store! Bleh! And if you want tartar sauce, you have to pay for it!!! That's right, a fish and chip restaurant and you cant get tartar sauce unless you pay extra. THEY have PETE'S SPECIAL SAUCE!! Who cares? It's fish, I want tartar but I have to pay extra. then it is carry out only, yep if you want to eat there they have out door picnic tables, that's some great ambiance! I'll take Long John Silvers over this crap any day!"}
{"text":"Hated the monster burger the meat looked and tasted old as shit it was hard and just nasty. ..shrimp was to breaded and got me sick fish was ok but really the only thing that tasted ok was the fries ...I will never go back and would never recommend it"}
{"text":"Pete's is cash only, and truthfully has gone downhill a bit. I didn't always go there as a phoenix native I probably just started going there within the last 2 years but I don't know what's going on with their sauce one time it seems like they just gave us straight up catch up so whatever you've done to the recipe can you please change it back."}
{"text":"First time here at Petes and I love the variety of options. I don't get to go to seafood places often as my fiancé doesn't care for anything that needs water to live. All around you get a great amount of food for the price. It's rather clear the seafood is frozen, but with the price point I am not one to complain. 
I don't really have any complaints other than the breading needs some seasoning."}
{"text":"Pete's = WOW!

Take $10 and buy all the shrimp and hot sauce you can -- thats all you need to know...

This is mostly a drive through joint, so take it on home, chow down, and thank me later..."}
{"text":"If this is fish and chips, then I'm a monkeys uncle!  They served some sort of RED sauce that i think had horseradish in it for your dipping sauce for the fish!  What the hell is that.  Fish and Chips get served with either Lemon and Tartare Sauce and  Malt Vinegar for your Chips.  Wont be going back there EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service & food. I'm not sure why this place has such negative reviews. Sure the fish is square & not your typical American fish & chips, but I've certainly had worse in England. It's fast, cheap and tasty. Customer service is great."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely disgusting. The fish and chips were soggy and tasted like they were microwaved. The prices are ridiculous for the quality and quantity of food you are receiving. To top it off the customer service is nonexistent. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"These people are not the friendliest however the food is fantastic the wait is not that long the atmosphere is awesome and you can't get better food from a fish and chips joint. Highly recommended by myself and most of my friends"}
{"text":"I'll give 3 stars for the price... you get what you pay for. I was sorely disappointed that \"one of the best fish & chips\" local places served frozen fried fish rectangles! They were gross. My husband got a triple monster burger and said it was plain tasting but ok. The red sauce was just spicy ketchup and the tarter sauce was ok. My cherry icee was the best thing I got. I tried it once that will probably be it."}
{"text":"It's cash only. Outside only. No bathroom. I just moved here from Minnesota and one of the places that popped up on my radar was this Pete's Fish and Chips in Mesa. When my mom came to visit, we spent a day checking out the sculptures and going to the Natural History Museum, then we took my daughter to Pete's. It is popular. The place was busy. There were cute signs around saying things like \"Clean up after yourself, your mother does not work here.\" My mom ordered the scallops, only to be told they'd been out of them for over a month and were looking for some more. Huh? How does one \"look\" for scallops for over a month?  I ordered the two-piece fish and chips. I have to say I was disappointed. I liked eating outside, I liked the orders being called out, I liked picking up the baskets but the actual food was not great. I was genuinely shocked that the fish were frozen square patties - crisply deep fried but frozen patties. The special sauce was unexciting - some kind of red cocktail sauce - no tartar sauce, no malt vinegar, no ketchup, no nothing. I was just very surprised. I had really wanted this to be a great place. It's got great atmosphere and is a fun hang out spot, but why can't the food be good? My daughter ate some fries and a mediocre rice krispy bar. She had fun sitting on the kiddie play things - I think there was a car or something. Bummer. I had really wanted to bond with the place, put their bumper sticker on my car and become a \"regular.\" That's not going to happen. I think Pete's is a champion at marketing. Their bumper stickers are free and their atmosphere is just like the atmosphere at those stands with really good food - like Pinks or the fish and chips place on Catalina or....anywhere. It has everything going for it:  \"charming, divey, locally popular place\" that people love - except the food is just so poor - very hot and fried, but just frozen and sad. Amazing."}
{"text":"For some reason, I don't know why, I had heard that Pete's fish and chips was a Tempe staple...if this true I have no idea why.  I mean, sure, the place is extremely well priced (3 of us ate here for less than a Jefferson). But I guess you get what you paid for because when my order arrived I hadn't been so disappointed since the Lost series finale.  The \"fish\", i guess that's what I ate, was hard as a rock, I was thinking about taking it home to play street hockey with later...it was that bad and it had no flavor what so ever.  Our meals also came with some \"shrimp\" and again, the dubious quotations are necessary.  I have never ate \"shrimp\" like that in my life..it was a small amount of shrimp-esque mush fried in a few tablespoons of batter...and it was similarly unflavorful..unless you call grease a flavor, which I do not."}
{"text":"This place is a respectable scam. As in I wish I thought of it! The good is something out of a microwave dinner, kids cuisine comes to mind."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed...my Glendale Pete's is great...but this location...not so much. It took forever in the drive thru at lunch, I got the shrimp and chips..no salt and over fried shrimp....I'll stick to Glendale..."}
{"text":"Square fish... Ewwww... No, just no! How is this place still open??? The frozen fish from any grocery store is WAY better than their fish!!! Everything was bland and tasted like deep fried cardboard! I use to love this place as a kid... It was no where near how I remembered it! Super disappointed!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are down here from Utah for a work conference. Them, being native Arizonians were excited to come to Pete's. I'll be honest, when we pulled up, the looks of Pete's didn't match their hype. It looks pretty grungy, but I thought I'd give it a chance and keep an open mind. 

The prices are a little steeper than I initially expected  and they only accept cash. 

I ordered the 3-piece Fish and Chips. It was pretty good. When it came out it came out with something called Pete's sauce, which is their specialty sauce. It was tasty, but it didn't really go with fish all that well so I went and bough a couple Tartar sauces. It was pretty weird that the Tartar sauce wasn't included with the fish in my opinion. Plus I had to pay 50¢ per sauce. It also came with fries which were pretty good, but I couldn't buy ketchup to did them in because Pete's doesn't serve ketchup for some reason. 

The restaurant was outdoors so I won't say much about cleanliness, but all the tables seemed to be kept clear and clean. It was a cool day when we went so it wasn't too hot, but if it is a hot day they have a water mister system that they can run to keep their patrons cool. 

Overall it was a good experience, a little pricey, but I would go again. You definitely need to try it al least once though!"}
{"text":"I finally made it in here when the line wasnt long. I ordered the Super seafood Combo. I had to wait a little bit, but i could tell it was being made fresh. And they didnt moan or whine about me asking for extra sauce. When i finally got my NOMS NOMS my car immediately smelled like FRESH fish and shrimp. 

The fish was great and didnt come with to much breading. The shrimp were nicely sized. Even the fries had a certain mystique about them that was absolutely delicious, and the sauce made everything taste that much better. And a slice of lemon in the bag always is a good sign. The employees are friendly as ever too. 
I love that they are open late. BUT REMEMBER CASH ONLY. Debit and credit card fees cant be that expensive but hey this place is still the same as it has been. 
Happy EATING."}
{"text":"Not sure why the great reviews over this place. It's a ruin down true hole in the wall kind of a place, food so so....nothing special...won't be back...

You gotta be kidding..."}
{"text":"1 And ye the LORD looked down upon the earth 2 and He saw a hovel on Apache Boulevard 3 and saw fit to populate it with a mere approximation of pescetarian \"food\" for 4 our God is a vengeful, spiteful, cruel God.

5 The sins committed by the men of Tempe were so wicked as to deserve such punishment 6 that they were never to be spoken of. 7 A pile of horrible, tiny pieces of fish-meal 8 are the LORD's manna from hell, 9 a punishment unlike any other on the soul, mind, and stomach.

10 Requiring only the smallest number of shekels, 11 God sought to tempt even he without sin 12 into sampling its putrid fruit, 13 the punishment for partaking not unlike that of Adam and Eve, having partaken of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

14 As they bit into the crusty, bland fish, 15 they became aware of their horrible betrayal of God and their stomachs 16 and were banished to the restroom for the rest of the evening. 

17 \"Frozen chunks of pressed fish meal does not fried fish make\" sayeth the LORD, issuing several commandments. 18 Thou shall not try the Pete's Sauce for it is awful and I hath spewed it from my mouth as it was lukewarm and tasted horrible. 19 Thou shall not give in to temptation for cheap fish, when it is known that Pete's is neither cheap (for one's soul, if not the wallet) nor fish. 20 A curse upon the household of any man who tries the hamburgers. The cramping of 10,000 stomachs shall be felt upon your own gut, a horrible taste left in your mouth for eternity. 21 You will forever recall the intense disappointment I feel of you as you feel for the meal you consume at Pete's. 22 It shall cast your mouth and gut into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

23 The serpent may tempt with \"chips\". 24 \"Do not heed his words,\" sayeth the LORD. They are soggy, ill-prepared, and above all, flavorless. 25 The breading hath no flavor but sadness, the fish no flavor but bland meal, both betraying its true genesis: 26 A frozen, preformed patty of processed misery. 27 God condemned this abomination and called, \"you are not one of my creatures!\"

28 \"They shall take only cash, as not even the credit card companies dare near their tainted field,\" God commanded.

29 The seventh angel will pour out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice will come out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, \"It is done!\" And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth. 30 Now the city was condemned to only ever eat from Pete's forevermore, an eternal damnation, a hell on earth, the sins of man so great, the punishment fitting with God's will."}
{"text":"I grew up (like a lot of us have) going to this place so my review is probably a little biased. It's one of those places that you miss terribly and HAVE to go to every once in a while even if it's not \"good\". It's true, the food isn't great but the sauce is EXCELLENT! I always get the same thing, the fish and chips and never regret going here. It's a favorite childhood memory!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business. Great food. Love this place. They are cash only and honestly I LOVE that too."}
{"text":"I have nothing but love for Pete's. Amazing food at a great bargain. An Arizona tradition. 

Side note - Get some class, Kerstin. Constructive criticism is good but joking about a horrific murder is not."}
{"text":"I saw this place advertised in Arizona Beehive and decided to give it a try. I ordered the #2 combo. I was not impressed with fish squares not shaped like fish but the shrimp with their secret sauce was tasty. I complained about the cold fries and was given a hot batch. They don't give drink refills so I ordered a new one without ice since I had plenty from my empty cup. It would be more convenient for them to charge a fee for card carrying customers. Don't think I'll be back and will try other nearby fish & chip places that are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I would have been better off going to the grocery store and buying frozen Fish Sticks.  My first clue was when I was told there was no malt Vinegar.  Seriously?  How dare you wear the flag of England on your shirts and tell me there is no vinegar.  When I order Fish and Chips, I expect a light, fluffy batter on an actual piece of fish that has not been chopped and frozen.  Ho can this place be an institution?"}
{"text":"OK, how do I put this best?

I don't go to Taco Bell for Mexican food. I don't go to Subway for a gourmet sandwich.

I don't go to Pete's for pub-worthy fish and chips.
 I go to Pete's because of what it is; cheap, easy and good for what it is. The fish is nowhere near as greasy as many places I have seen it - the bag isn't soaked through by the time I bring it back to work - a huge plus! The sauce is the true star for me, addicting indeed. 

Like I say, don't go in expecting a gourmet meal of fish and chips, dip everything in sauce, and perhaps you'll be addicted as well!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give zero stars. The cashier that rang me up was so rude it seemed unreal. When I told him that he made a mistake on the drinks he got very agitated and rolled his eyes at me. He then told me that I was wrong and did not say that.The food was disgusting. The shrimp was 75 percent breading. The cashier also thought it was acceptable to tell me what I should and should not order my child. When I told him it was none of his business he got offended.  Needless to say we will not return."}
{"text":"For the life of me I cannot understand why people like this place!! Stopped by the drive thru for some lunch today and first thing I noticed was the big CASH ONLY sign on the wall. Seriously, what functioning business doesn't accept cards these days. Get with the times guys. Not to mention they will not accept a bill over $20 (tried to pay with a fifty on a $32 order and was told NO).

Now for the food... gross! I have had better fish and chips in an elementary school cafeteria. The fish was overly breaded and over cooked. The fries were soggy and tasteless. Then, their so called \"special sauce\" is just watered down ketchup. Nothing very \"special\" about it at all!

Needless to say, I will not be returning here again. Long John Silvers has better food and better prices.

Oh and service with a smile or at least some kind of emotion would help."}
{"text":"Nasty food couldn't even finish it. Over battered shrimp and bland, tasteless and mushy fish. The French fries weren't even good! So disappointed because we love this type of food. Never going back."}
{"text":"Always on point, I've been coming to Pete's since I was little. Of course it's fried food which isn't good for you but it always hits the spot when it's cheat day. The sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Poor substitute for fish!  You have to eat outside and the fish are fish cakes that would be absolutely tasteless without their sauce.  Service was quick, food was lousy No bath room, no taste, no goee backee!  Learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Was highly disappointed with this place after hearing good things... the good things were lies I tell ya, all lies. This fish was just awful and some of the saltiest stuff I have ever put to my lips. I didn't eat what I bought and I won't be going back. Long John Silver's looks like gold compared to this place."}
{"text":"Been going to this location since I was 4 y.o.  love the monster burger. The burrito tastes great. The fries, shrimp, and fish are great too. Love the spicy ketchup!! Its all good!! Love this place! When I was younger they use to have a ball pit for kids. Don't know why they got rid of it but there are a lot more tables now, which they probably need. Great place! Don't feed the birds! Lol"}
{"text":"When dining here and to have a satisfactory experience you must, and I strongly insist that you bring your patience. This location certainly could never be accused of speedy service. I know it seems strange for a fast food restaurant. Most folks order insane amounts in the drive through. However there could certainly be improvements to the hustle of the staff. Just remember this located in Tempe near ASU and their employees are in and out like revolving door....college kids. This is certainly not authentic Fish and Chips, but I'm not a snob and can appreciate it. They don't have Malted Vinegar, if tarter sauce is your thing that's extra. Items come with standard issue Pete's Sauce. Think of Franks Red Hot having an affair with cocktail sauce. Now if you still have curiosity and are an adventurer, below is some advice.

Remain Calm and Dine On.......
 
Pete's Tips
1.) Know and feel confident with what you're ordering. (This step can be improved with letting people go ahead of you while you decide. Manners People..Manners)
 
2.) Have Cash...this establishment is Cash Only. (This location has an ATM onsite, but it does charge for its use. Broke or Poor college kids that last bit is for you.)
 
3.) Whew, you made it to this step you've ordered and are given a number....Don't Lose It.!!

4.) This is the critical part HAVE PATIENCE.! There's nothing you can do and being angry won't magically make food appear.

5.) No need to be polite at this point. Eat with your hands make noises, if you brought utensils you probably also throw un-popped bubble wrap away....you can't be trusted."}
{"text":"This is the slowest service I have ever experienced. The drive thru line is a half an hour long even though there's only six cars. The line at the window is even worse, you have to wait an hour. After waiting an hour for my food, it ended up being cold. A fry was still partly frozen. If you do decide to go here...REMEMBER CASH, they do not accept any cards."}
{"text":"I grew up going to this joint often. I love their crabettes and shrimp (but the fries, not so much)."}
{"text":"I had to try this place after 20+ years!  It's still the same, for the most part....Cheap food, very cheap prices.  
The \"monster burger\" isn't so big, and the shrimp isn't in that old strip style.  I recommend the onion rings! 
It's always busy, they only take cash, and it's outside tables.  It's been around for so long because it's popular in the neighborhoods they serve.  
I'm going to say they are a fun visit, but not a regular stop for me any more.  
Worth the nostalgic visit."}
{"text":"Well, I have lived in AZ for 16 years and finally decided to try this Pete's I have heard so much about. We were in line with 10 other people and it moved really quickly. I didn't have cup holders in my car for all the drinks and the staff got me a box to carry everything. They were super helpful. The staff is really excellent; however, the food is so-so.  I really was looking forward to something more authentic, not a pressed patty I could have purchased myself at Costco.  If you want really good, authentic fish and chips go to either Rula Bula in Tempe or  RT O' Sullivan's.  The best word for this experience was \"meh.\"  I can't say I ever plan on going back. And now I know I haven't missed out on much in the last 16 years....."}
{"text":"This was my worst experience at a fish and chips place. I got the fish and shrimp combo with a drink and with fish, I was expecting tartar sauce... no they have their Pete's special sauce. Their sauce has nothing special about it!!! You have to pay to have tartar sauce with your fish! The food was nothing good at all! The fish tasted like processed food that you would buy at Walmart in a box already made! And you have to wait to get your drinks until your whole order is ready! Me and my family will never spend another penny coming to this place. Please do not waste your time coming here! Very disappointed"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I am still waiting to poop this abomination out of my body in order to feel some semblance of normalcy. Rare is the day when you're driving down the road and DON'T see an \"Im Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips\" bumper sticker. However, as a native Canadian who has been in the States for over 30 years and Arizona for about 27 years, I had yet to eat fish & chips below the 49th parallel. My husband, a Bay Area transplant, had a hankering' for some fish and chips and thought - \"what better place to try than the one advertised on many a back bumper?\" So off we went in the Ferrari of minivans...

My husband asked how big the pieces of fish were - after all, you could get 4 pieces for under $7 - how big could they be? \"About the size of a fish sandwich\" said the guy behind the counter. that should have been our first clue.Both of us are used to pieces of fish being of the plate-sized variety.

We didn't get \"fish and chips\". What we got was a mystery substance covered in cracker-meal then flash frozen for God knows how long before it's dropped in grease. EVERYTHING lacked flavor, except for the ketchup+Tapatio known as \"Pete's Sauce\".  The \"shrimp\" - like the \"fish\" - was of questionable origin... about as authentic as the \"Rolex\" you can get from the guy with the trench coat in New York. The fries were bland - totally tasteless. Not sure what was in that plastic packet that claimed to be \"Malt Vinegar\". 
 
If the Mother Country knew these yokels were wearing the Union Flag on the backs of their uniform shirts, we'd be thrust into war with her, for certain!

The whole experience forced me back into my Canada Rule. Never again. 

Really deserves no (or negative) stars... but Yelp won't let me grade that low."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite. I won't say that they have the best quality food but it's good enough for me. And I've never understood why some people expect anything fresh and healthy from a fast food place. \"Fast food\" and \"healthy\" are on opposite sides of the spectrum! I am a big believer in the saying \"you get what you pay for.\" 

My go-to meal here is the 7 piece shrimp and chips and a monster burger plain with cheese. Yummy. 

Pete's does need to get with the times. They only take cash. It's a bit funny to see Pete's n00bs asking if they can use their cards. If you need cash, you can go next door to the Circle K and get some. They have a $40 cash back limit, if I am not mistaken. 

You will likely have to do some bum dodging. They mostly hang around the Circle K area but sometimes wander over to Pete's. 

Ironically, I've been eating here since I was a kid but I have never tried the fish. Not a fish person at all! 

Other than the bums and the no debit/credit, the only other complaint I have is that they did not put enough ice in my rasberry ice tea on my last visit.

Bon Appétit !"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after many years of wanting to, and my husband and I were very disappointed.  Ever had the chicken fingers and fries at Ikea? Same exact food here except my fries at Ikea were cooked properly.  Overpriced processed food and unfriendly service.  Will never return."}
{"text":"The food is good. It's always busy. I just wish they'd accept debit cards. The shrimp is my fav!"}
{"text":"Being from the  UK ! I went to Pete's fish and chips,I expected British style fish and chips with malt vinegar on the side,,I ordered their fish chips and shrimp combo ,they didn't have vinegar ,what I got was frozen  fish squares and  frozen weird shape shrimp,I could have went to Macdonalds and had their fish fillet and it would have been tastier. The food was absolutely disgusting.
They  should not have a British flag flying to advertise their fish and chips as it does not even come close to British food."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch. This is fast food deep fried fish and chips. nothing spectacular about it nothing bad either. I had the sloppy fish sandwich with cheese. This was a breaded manufactured fish filet, probably a frozen one, on a bun topped with a cheese slice and coleslaw. The service was fast, the food ok. I will come here if I'm in the area and it's lunch time, but I won't travel across town just to go to Pete's. The price is reasonable. They are a cash only place."}
{"text":"I went to Pete's because my roommates love this place, but, I come from the Pacific Northwest.  The fish was okay, but, the fries were soggy and the shrimp tasted like breaded cardboard.  The only saving grace was the sauce they give you, but, it was weirdly spicy and I wasn't a fan of that either.  Take into account that everyone has their own tastes, but, I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Hands down I love the fish 
Always a great lunch or dinner
Don't take big bills or cc cash only
Nice friendly staff
Try the messy fish if they offer it."}
{"text":"Unless you're looking to impress a crack head come casual.....lock your bike up and enjoy the perfectly battered shrimp and oh so good finger lickin Pete's sauce. If your feelin adventurous the burritos are greasy good and the cheese burgers are no joke"}
{"text":"For the best Fish N Chips ever?  Pete's drive-thru takes cash only.  The best scallops!"}
{"text":"In this Lenten season Pete's would do well to remember they are no longer one of very few fish and chip places in town.  I don't usually go to Pete's because i am more health conscious now than in my youth but I had fond memories of good fish and chips.  I thought i would try a couple pieces of Pete's fish for dinner on Ash Wednesday.  Imagine my surprise to find out that they do NOT supply tarter sauce with their fish.  If you want tarter sauce you have to pay extra for it.  I went to another fish and chip restaurant and not only received tarter sauce free of charge but also received an extra for no extra cost.  I will not be returning to Pete's nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips. Get the shrimp and fish plate. I like the crunch from the square fish. The plate is big enough to split. 

The sauce is really unique and comes with everything. Has a bite to it. Not quite ketchup, not quite cocktail sauce. 

The burgers are greasy and good. They also come with Pete's sauce for the fries. The combo comes with a fried burrito too. That is another good one. 

The onion rings are coated in a corn meal based batter and fried to a good crisp bite."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I've been going here since I was a child and nothing has changed since then.  It is a particular taste and you will have cravings for the magnificence that is Pete's Sauce.  The Rice Krispy is the best you'll ever have, perfectly melty and tasty!  Don't forget to get Onion Rings if it isn't Friday, you won't regret it!! Also Don't Forget to Bring Cash!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to rate Pete's.  You HAVE to love it, but it's not like the food is out of this world, the closest thing to atmosphere is watching birds chase after crumbs and you know it's not at all healthy for ya and yet...  Pete's has been in business since 1947 so it's quite an Arizona tradition to go at least a few times.

Pete's Fish and Chips are all around the valley, but I happen to think pretty highly of this location.  It's not far from my house so we're often running errands in the area or I can pick it up on the way home.  But also, it has more of an old-school neighborhood feel - even though you can sit at a table facing Central Ave.  Really great diverse crowd pretty much every time we go.  And so far everyone has been fairly friendly when waiting, which can be so important in a hungry crowd.

Plain fish and chips are all good, as are their fish sandwiches.  Their shrimp is actually my favorite I think.  The sauce that comes with all fried goodies has some spice to it, but has enough ketchup-y ness that even the wimps at our table (cough-my girlfriend-cough-cough) can enjoy it.  They make a pretty mean burger too.  Prices are pretty cheap, though if you go hungry and think \"Wow, this is cheap!  Maybe we should also get sides of this and that too!\" it can get more expensive, but in a deep-fried-yummylishious kind of way that somehow makes it all ok. 

It's generally service with a smile, but sometimes, well, folks might have gotten a bit of extra grease splashed their way or something.  It's never hurt the quality (Can I use that word here?) of the product.  

And just to mix things up, my location at least also serves corn dogs, chicken and steak sandwiches, horchata and an assortment of Pete's goodies like bumper stickers, t-shirts and beanies.  And don't forget a quarter fed merry-go-round for the kids.  Gotta love it."}
{"text":"Place is so grossss total dump, I recently went to tempe for spring training and this place was right next door to our hotel \"comfort inn\"  this place is a dump big mistake food is like rubber and greasy not to mention you have to pay sauce??? that is just stupid  not to mention it's cash out, that should of been a red flag for dump.  Gave me an upset stomach"}
{"text":"The worst service . Dirty and and bad customer service. Drive thru to close to the street . Dangerous for Glendale traffic !!"}
{"text":"Sad to say I have to agree with the other reviews I didn't want to believe it because I use to love coming here years ago. I decided to take my wife since she never had it.

No flavor it's just very plain. They really need to revamp themselves before they become a thing of the past.

The only reason I gave 3 stars is because it's Petes Fish and Chips."}
{"text":"I grew up on Petes living near ASU. It was a big treat for us when mom came home with shrimp and chips. Though the fries, I've never been a fan of. 
I live in Cali now but when I  visit, Petes is always on the \"must go to\" list. The last few times I was Slightly disappointed. It isn't what it used to be but still good. I took my cali boy boyfriend there because I rant and rave about it all the time and he didn't care for it. Must be a local thing! Cash only can be pretty inconvenient. Maybe Petes should think about changing that in today's times. Nobody carries cash really."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Love this location as well, right in the heart of phoenix. It saddens me when i read other reviews of people saying horrible things about this spot, nevertheless....my favorite menu items include the fish, scallops and fries and of course the SAUCE!!! I bring my 2 year old son with me and he will dunk all his fries in the Pete's sauce....and when his fries are gone my son will drink any remaining sauce!!! He loves coming to eat here and enjoys everything on the menu... Also there is a little alleycat that can be found outside 90% of the time and my son will always look for him and try to sneak him pieces of his super seafood combo!!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while Pete's can kind of hit the spot... but I'm not quite as crazy about it as some locals seems to be. The fish and chips are good and cheap; and their special sauce is pretty damn tasty... but I usually leave feeling a little fishy and greased out. 

The fish is perfectly square, and I can't help but wonder why they do it that way... because it really gives off a 'store bought' vibe. Compare this to somewhere like Fulton Fish Fry in Vegas which has fresh pieces of fish that each kind of form their own twisted and unique shape... it just feels more authentic that way. This just feel like a fish patty that could have been taken out of a McDonalds Filet-O-Fish and thrown in the greaser.

So what I gotta say about Pete's is this: only go if you're craving some no-frills fish and chips; and if you have such a craving you'll probably leave happy... if however you are looking for something to make your taste buds shiver with excitement, then look elsewhere. 

Oh yeah... one last thing... their whole sense of entitlement really gets on my nerves sometimes. Having kooky rules at a restaurant is fun, but it only works if that restaurant is serving up magnificent food. Here you are getting average food and they try to make you feel like they are the Gods of Fish and you must bow down and obey their every command if you want to get served (like their whole \"no ketchup-don't even ask\" thing). You better be careful Pete's or you may find people are gonna find somewhere else with better food, that doesn't hassle you if you ask for ketchup. Meh."}
{"text":"I checked the ratings on Yelp before visiting this place.  Everyone went on and on about it saying how if you live in Phoenix it's the place to go.  Uh....NO.  It was disgusting.  It was over priced for what it was and not worth it at all.   My advice...if you're looking for fast food seafood just go grab some frozen food and put it in the oven.  That's going to be much better than anything you're going to get here."}
{"text":"All Pete's have good fish that comes with a unique sauce and fries. I love that I can finally walk to a Pete's. Wish they were open more often. And it's a budget friendly CHOWery."}
{"text":"Not quick, but freshly cooked food. Great fish and chips and fried sides like the deep fried mushrooms and zucchini.

There's a little bit of outdoor seating available and no indoor seating. This is a mostly \"to go\" kind of place, and with gas prices as they are, you probably won't want to sit around in the drive thru waiting for your food with the car running.

Friendly employees, good food, and decent prices. It's no wonder this is a Phoenix area institution.

Be sure to bring cash. They don't accept credit cards and they don't accept checks."}
{"text":"HEY all you Yelpers out there...
Howz come it always seems that whenever a restaurant, diner or eatery hits on a successful recipe they wanna tweek it?  Even a lowly place like Pete's is no exception. Years ago, back in the 60's, they hit on one at Pete's. The fried shrimps were outstanding! Nice large juicy shrimps coated in a light crispy batter similar to tempura made it destination dining. Being inexpensive and delicious they appealed to the masses. When I returned from a tour in the USMC, it was beckoning for me to return. Went to the one on South Central and ordered a large shrimp and chips only to find heavily battered deep fried minced shrimps. Disappointed I ate them anyways.
Soon, I got used them and continued to go to Pete's. Now fast forward to the present. 
They are now mass produced minced shrimps coated with bread crumbs then stamped into the shape of a shrimp and deep fried, identical to frozen ones found at any grocery store except they are now more expensive and come with only a handful of 
French fries! So sad,,,not likely to return unless someone else picks up the tab. I never turn down free food usually!
Progress? Bah! 
2 stars for the food being hot and convenient."}
{"text":"I can make frozen processed fish patties and fries at home. Yuk! People were lined up for this crap. Literally out of the freezer and into the deep fryer. Tasteless fish and soggy fries. Disgusting."}
