{"text":"Food is good.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back green pea risotto with grilled shrimp...was the best thing on your menu...Perfectly cooked and seasoned risotto with peas and Parmesan, topped with perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp on skewers...delicious. However very expensive for what it is, especially for breakfast ($4.00 for toast; $18.00 for a plate of eggs, bacon and hash-browns...c'mon)."}
{"text":"A fancy looking restaurant with wonderful service! The waitress was very attentive and cleared plates and kept drinks filled. The weekday lunch is a buffet, which is decent food. On one side are the cold chicken and potato salads, vegetable salads, and hummus. On the other side are the hot dishes, of which there are a few meat dishes, and then a couple veggie ones - on this day they were fingerling potatoes, and some sort of squash stew. In the middle, a chef can make you cook to order pasta. And finally, there's the dessert bar, which had several scrumptious choices, including fresh fruit. Maybe the dinner menu has more inspirational veggie options than the lunch buffet, I'm not sure.  There may be a dress code too, so don't meander in with a ragged t-shirt on. But that's unlikely, given how this place is inside the Intercontinental Hotel and Cleveland Clinic. So, overall, the food (particularly for vegetarians) isn't as spectacular as the decor, but hey, just eat one of the desserts and it's all worth it."}
{"text":"Service was spotty and distracted on both visits 5 days apart. Food was fairly well executed on the first visit but close attention to detail is lacking for the whopping premium we paid for hotel restaurant food.  I was surprised by my reaction to bad service but I think the very high price accentuated the bad service so while I would have given 3 stars for the food, the service was so distracted and bad, that for the premium I paid, I would have given no stars at all.   FIRST VISIT: I had the salmon in miso broth. It was served on top of blanched bok choy. The ends of the bok choy leaves were yellowed and blackened---bad bad bad. Gordon Ramsey would have had a cow over it.  My server forgot my side of rice. Brought it at the end of my meal. It was AWFUL!  Lumpy and cooled. Fortunately the salmon was perfectly cooked and fresh.   My husband had the lamb burger. It was well executed and flavorful. The harira soup looked and tasted like Chef Boy Ardee with garbanzo beans.  What a comical contrast.   My older son had the green pea risotto. Very well executed but again not enough attention to detail. The peas overwhelmed the risotto with their grassiness. The technique was excellent. The risotto was the right amount of toothsomeness and cheesiness but those grassy peas!  Set my teeth on edge.    Don't ask for anything special and expect flawless service or for that matter anything straight off the menu. We asked for a hamburger for my son without the bun (he can't eat wheat). The burger came out properly done but obviously had sat under the warmer for so long that it had cooled and the cheese was hardening. Our server forgot the bacon. Brought it out later.  We ordered sweet potato fries. He brought out regular fries. Sigh.   SECOND VISIT: California chicken wrap with sweet potato fries, nachos, cheeseburger mid-rare with fries.   Disaster. Only two tables in the jernt. It took our food 30 minutes to arrive.  A manager came by to apologize that one of the dishes had to be redone and food would arrive shortly. Okay, but I've been in a kitchen during down time between shifts with slackers and my antennae went shooting up.   Food starts to arrive. The chicken wrap came with a big fried egg in it---not in the menu description--granted, we didn't tell our server we have egg allergies, so we asked him to take it back. The sweet potato fries were limp and greasy--that means the frier wasn't up to temperature when they tossed in the frozen fries. I asked our server to take them back and have them redone.   When the chicken wrap came back, the avocado was super hard and other than being green was not recognizable as avocado. My twelve year old has a massive appetite and even he got turned off.   Our cheeseburger arrived in the same sad shape as it did on our first visit. Cooled with hardening cheese.   The nachos were comically bad. They too had sat under the heater and the cheese sauce (not real cheese) had started to congeal, the chips were soggy and the jalape√±os dried out from the heat lamp. The chicken squares were dry.   My anger was starting to brim.   I have an unusually high threshold and it's hard for me to get too whipped up about poor or sloppy service b/c we usually eat at dives and \"ethnic\" eateries but when I pay a premium for hotel restaurant food--it's b/c I have to eat there for convenience, not by choice and if it's bad and not just pedestrian, it really burns me, but I usually have little time and energy to get heated about it. I just know what I'm dealing with and will lower my expectations and avoid them and issue a curse o'er their houses for eternity (that takes surprisingly little emotional energy b/c I only need to do it once and the bad experience is captured on yelp for future reference).   But this second visit exceeded even my high threshold for restaurant crappiness and when that happens, I have to act and act I did.   I complained to the manager whose response was someone in the kitchen didn't know what they were doing. Wow. That's completely unacceptable for a manger to say that to a customer. They didn't charge for the wrap. I didn't ask for any other comp.  I was getting mad and I don't like being mad b/c it screws with my appetite--I actually won't eat when I'm unhappy.   First visit disappointment, shame on North Coast.  Second visit disappointment, shame on me for expecting something different.   There will be no third time.  As I left the Intercontinental, I asked for a manager. I bent her ear about my complaints; she took a lot of notes and our room number at the Intercontinental Suites.  That evening, C2 at the Intercontinental Suites provided our meal gratis to make up for the terrible experience we had at North Coast.  We appreciated the effort by C2 and the Intercontinental Suites, but I won't be back to North Coast unless I have to go."}
{"text":"The North Coast Cafe is one place I have been to more times than any other restaurant in Cleveland because I have meet people for lunch and for work and it is paid by my employer. I have been here on an average 3 times a week for past two months.   I have always been here only for their lunch buffet and nothing else so my review is purely based on it.   First thing is there is a dress code so no one from the Clinic can just walk in here in their scrubs. They have some blazers available at the front area which you can borrow. You will find some people sitting with unfitting jackets, and those are the people who did not wear formal dress up on arrival.   They have an amazing selection of salads. It is very nice to have about 6 to 7 choices including some improvised american, Mediterranean and some basic versions. They have very nice soups too. There is always a man standing there is who is ready to help you with your choice of pasta and some kind of meat. There is good selection of side dishes too. They always have something from India if you are in to curried and spiced up food. So overall decent food. The food tastes good and does not disappoint you most of the time.   The best part is the dessert!! I am not a big dessert fan but the dessert here is awesome. They make it look so pretty that I always have one dessert dish. They have almost as many options for dessert as for main dish, which makes it more appealing. The serving sizes are standard for dessert. I sometimes want to take a picture of every dessert I eat here, it is very pretty.   The cafe is located inside the Intercontinental hotel and the best way to enter is from Carnegie avenue."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Went here for lunch with my mother.  We were staying at the hotel upstairs.  We were tired when we got in and needed something to eat.  We had the calamari, the chicken consomme, and a turkey club.  The calamari was different than others that I had had in the past.  However, it was quite good.  The soup was vegetables in chicken broth.  The turkey club was fine.  What earns this place a 1/5 stars is the server's and hostess's manners.  The hostess gave us the breakfast menu at 3 PM.  Moreover she and the server would have loud conversations about their lives and work around the customers.  Poor professionalism.  The server would reach far across the table to grab stuff almost getting my food in his armpit.  In this instance he did it to get the check after I signed it.  Kind of odd IMO. It weirded my mom out.  I can't really recommend coming here.  The food is okay but the price and service make me want to venture into the neighborhood for something else to eat."}
{"text":"So, this is hidden inside the Hotel Intercontinental at the Cleveland Clinic main campus.  Don't let the address fool you.  Situated beside the swanky Table 45, this \"cafe\" really serves buffet style affairs that range from more traditional american fare to pilafs, pastas, asian fusion, middle eastern and indian, depending on the day.  A moderately robust menu for a la carte items are also available.    Setting is prim but relaxed.  Food is varied, but a tad restrained.  Good place to eat if you're in the complex, and want a little more quiet than available in the main cafeteria, don't want to walk to Au Bon Pain, nor want to spend at Table 45..."}
{"text":"3 stars for the breakfast. The breakfast buffet was the usual fare, though I did enjoy the smoked salmon. The breakfast buffet was overpriced. The granola looked good though!  Service was generally good, but a little slow for a late breakfast with our party being the only ones present. The waitress came by frequently but interjected at some odd points in our conversation.  Apparently, the lunch buffet is amazing!"}
{"text":"North Coast Cafe is a very nice restaurant located within the Intercontinental Hotel at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus.  This restaurant definitely caters to the hospital crowd including health professionals and families of patients.  The food selection is great, as is the service.  There is a nice lunch buffet that is offered, though perhaps not the best choice if you are a vegetarian as the selection is somewhat limited.  Despite this, I found plenty of viable options on the main menu from which to choose.  The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side, but I'd say worth it given the quality."}
{"text":"If you work in the this side of town, e.g. University Circle, Case, UH, Clinic; then this is a recommended place for a get-away lunch with a relaxed environment and pace. There's a lot of natural light -- useful if you've worked indoors all morning. I eat here often, and more so on stressful weeks, LOL. Or, if you're here on a job interview, and they take you to this place, all the better.  Features: 1. A chef that can custom make pasta or carve a roast (they have a different kind every day). For breakfast, custom omelettes or eggs to your liking --  a must have for a breakfast buffet.  2. It is a well-balanced buffet with a great selection of leafy and non-leafy salads. Entrees have a least one each of red meat, chicken, fish and vegetables. If the carb happens to be polenta, then you're in luck. There's always soup. Entrees are always kept hot but never dried out or burned, always well-cooked, with just great quality and care for the food overall.  3. Free valet if you eat here. Just need the ticket validated by the restaurant. Same with Table 45.  4. The menu items are also very good -- but the buffet is the special feature here.  5. A lot of Cleveland Clinic doctors around (who are required to hang and check the lab coats at the door). So if you choke or have an emergency, there's a high likelihood you'll survive.  Downsides: Food coma at 2PM and loss of productivity"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a colleague's promotion to another department. Very convenient location to my work. Most of our group got the lunch time buffet for $20; I was hesitant at this high price at first, but then I saw what was offered and found it to be reasonable for the selections.   Bear with me because I cannot remember the food items exactly, but that day they had a couple of different salad options: this cubed cheese and meats one, fruits, caesar, grilled vegetable salad with squash and zucchini, etc. There was also a small selection of rolls you could choose from. They had a carving station with prime rib that included au jus and horseradish sauce. Further down the line there were big containers of buttery mashed potatoes, those fancy little carrots and asparagas, chicken marsala, and this divine creamy fish dish. For dessert they had a selection of about five different options of tarts, fruits, cakes, and mousse confections.   I was not so impressed with the desserts, but I really wanted to make a couple trips up to the buffet! I would recommend this place for business meals or work celebrations."}
{"text":"This is a lovely atmosphere as it is within the Intercontinental Hotel. I have been here for both the breakfast buffet as well as lunch buffet. For breakfast, there is a pretty standard spread of General Mills cereals and milk, orange juice, coffee/tea, etc. and a nice make-your-own omelette station (though beware--a line definitely forms here). If you're vegan, your options will pretty much be restricted to fruit and potentially some of the cereals/oats.   Lunch has an impressive spread of desserts and a hearty spread of meats dishes and roasted vegetables. Vegans will likely have to order off the menu (their kale salad is actually pretty good!), and sometimes even the vegetable dishes are made with meat products (broth, etc) so vegetarians may find few options, as well. On one occasion, I was there with my family and my salad took ~40 minute to come out, so it was given to me for free and I was allowed to take whatever I wanted from the buffet.  In general, though the service (there's a coat check, too) and location are great, I have found the food to be just \"OK,\" hence the 3 stars. It's nothing horrible or bad, but nothing particularly creative or unique. The taste of the food definitely does not align well with the price."}
{"text":"I was kind of expecting more. This place is really nice when you walk in. It is clean and the staff is really friendly and polite. The food could use a makeover.  For the cost, the meal should be out of this world. Even the desserts didn't seem that fresh."}
{"text":"Mmm. The lunch buffet.  Being on an interview is great. They really give you good food. At the midpoint of my interview day, the recruiter brought me to north coast cafe. Honestly, I had eaten breakfast their that morning, which I had previously been disappointed with, as it was pretty pricey just for a bagel and coffee. Nonetheless, I had the lunch buffet with him.  Omg, SO GOOD. They had a cauliflower soup, all types of salads, rotisserie chicken, prime rib (I refrained from it, sadly, as I didn't want to get sleepy in the middle of the interview), veggies, and some type of seafood dish, which had huge scallops in it. And then to top it off..... there were DESSERTS! yum yum. I got this chocolate mousse with some type of caramel crunch bottom.... plus other cakes as well. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great lunch."}
{"text":"I went there for the lunch buffet a while ago and I remembered it being pretty decent! The service was excellent - lots of smiley faces and attention. I really liked the salad and pasta station. You make your own pasta and this dude will cook for you. yummy! Don't forget to check out their dessert section - they have many different kinds there, some of them with fresh fruits, which I really liked. Overall, a fancy looking place that does not cost you an arm and a leg!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch finally. I highly recommend it. The amount of - good - food on the buffet was really impressive. First I must say I really enjoyed the (changing) chef attended station which today was stir fry. There was also a lamb carving station. The stir fry station had lots of good varied fresh veg options and for meat even shrimp! Other buffet ($20) items included various cold salads, salmon paella, dill chicken, roasted cauliflower.... There was also a dessert buffet area with about 4 choices. What I really liked in general about the buffet was that the international theme - there was flavour and dishes representing many different areas. The place was packed, mostly with CC workers, so make a reservation. While there is no dress code since this is a hotel restaurant, owing to the clientele the dress that is present tends to be on the upper side of casual to dress clothes."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, but food was pretty standard and subpar. Had to ask for a refill for my water. I got the chicken wrap which was hard to eat and messy. Taste was alright. The side green salad was less than impressive and also hard to eat in a miniature bowl."}
