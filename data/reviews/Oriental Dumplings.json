{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea in the city, and I don't live close to it at all! They use really high quality fruit for the fresh fruit teas and they don't skimp on the bubbles. 

The service is also really good and when I've requested drinks that aren't on the menu, they are fine with making what I want! I usually get eye rolls when I ask for different combos at other places. 

I've tried the dumplings and they are also really good. I see everyone orders wings there too...I will try them eventually :)"}
{"text":"I was craving dumplings and my favourite dumpling place Jiayuan Dumpling House is in Lethbridge and living only blocks away from Oriental Dumpling I decided to give it a try. I ordered the DP3 which is a dozen pork, chinese chives and shrimp dumplings and A7 the taiwanese fried chicken. The service was not the best, I was shown to a table, left with the menus and basically ignored as the server went about cleaning and clearing tables. I set my menus down closed and waited for a good 8 minutes until I finally called out to him that I was ready to order. He had walked past me several times during this time.  I was given a pair of chopsticks and a saucer (yes the bottom plate of what a teacup usually sits on) as the plate from which I was to eat the dumplings. The dumplings arrived fairly timely and looked boring, which in itself is not surprising, boiled dumplings look like boiled dumplings but I was hungry so I happily bit into one. If you have tried the dumplings in Lethbridge then I would say don't bother with the ones here as they will be a great disappointment. The dough is not quite the right texture, a bit too pasty and the filling bland and ffavourless.  There was a bottle of vinegar and a bottle of soya sauce as well as some house made hot oil. I made a concoction of half vinegar half soy sauce and some hot oil. I dipped the dumpling into the sauce and sad to say when it comes to dumplings your sauce can be a saving grace but in this case the vinegar was a cheap dark variety with a harsh flavour which did nothing to improve the taste of the dumplings. Vinegar and dumplings go together so if you're not going to bother in investing in one half of the dish then it's a rough start from the get-go. The taiwanese fried chicken wasn't too bad, nice and crisp on the outside and very tender and moist on the inside, however it too was under-seasoned. The bubble teas that were served around me looked like it is what this place does well, as well as the chicken wings that some of my neighbours were having. I, unfortunately, had neither bubble tea nor wings. Dumplings is part of the name of the restaurant so that's what I went for. Based on the taiwanese chicken the cook obviously has good technique so I might give it another shot to try something else. There were some interestingly named Szechuan dishes on a small menu in one of those small plastic display things that apparently are new additions but I generally try what I think are the mainstay of a place to judge its merit. The other server came around after and he seemed extremely friendly and efficient. Maybe it's growing pains, it is a new restaurant and other people have said service and the fried dumplings are good so maybe it was just an off-night. I generally will give a place a 2nd try unless my first one was a real disaster so we'll see in a few months if I change my tune."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  My son and I had passed by so many times on the way to school and the \"All You Can Eat Wings\" sign was enticing.  When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly server and told that we could sit wherever we wanted (there were around 12 or 13 tables here).  I did find it odd that the air conditioning was running at full blast on a cool day (plus bubble tea = brain freeze!), but the server explained that the landlord controlled the temperature of the entire building and the individual shopkeepers couldn't do a thing about this, unfortunately.
       Most of the items on the menu were under $10.00 and with a Yelp Check-in you can get a free bubble tea with a $20.00 purchase.  Our son enjoyed his Phoenix Tear bubble tea (a gigantic glass with a generous portion of pearls) and his \"create your own noodle soup\".  He chose thick rice noodles with enoki mushrooms, fried egg, won ton, and Chinese sausage.  The soup base was flavourful and the won tons were very toothsome (not the one-bite kind). The Chinese sausage was too sweet for his (and my) liking, though.  We were expecting more of a lap cheung taste.
       The pork, Chinese chives and shrimp boiled dumplings were bland; the dumpling wrappers were too thick.  They definitely needed the vinegar that was provided on your table -- or not.  The flavour of the vinegar was very harsh so we had to mix it with some soy sauce.  My son and hubby said that they preferred my homemade dumplings.   
       The hot teas were pretty good, though -- I had a steaming hot, strong ginger honey green tea and hubby had a fragrant lychee tea.
       The deep fried squid tentacles and lemon pepper chicken wings were delicious (I originally wanted to try a half order of sweet ginger as well as the lemon pepper wings but was told that it would be too complicated for the new chef).
    However, the deep fried scallops and Taiwanese fried chicken were disappointing; there was a delightful crunch when we bit into the scallop coating, but we couldn't taste the scallop (it was like eating mush).  As for the chicken, it was seasoned with too much pepper and not enough five spice.  The pieces were also unusually small (compared to Lazy Monkey) and consisted of mostly batter, bits of skin and fat.  
     There is an All You Can Eat menu from Sun to Thurs ($18.95 per person; includes chicken wings, vinaigrette cucumbers, shrimp wonton soup, french and Mexi fries, spring rolls, onion rings, and Taiwanese minced meat on rice).
     I missed out on wings specials again. Darn. We would probably return on these days when the regular chef is around."}
{"text":"Been here a few times...food is decent, very good service and very friendly (normally places like these have bad service, but not here).  
Wings are big and cheap.  Bubble tea is made of fresh fruit only and good value.  Their dumplings are very good (try the deep fried style)."}
