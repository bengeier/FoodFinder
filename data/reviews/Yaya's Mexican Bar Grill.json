{"text":"Amazing tacos and very allergy friendly. I tried 3 different street tacos and all were very tasty. Thanks for allowing GF people a tasty meal"}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners make sure personally that everything is good and the servers are wonderful. The buffet had lots of choices and the Mac and cheese was delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible ...long wait for ANYTHING. Soggy chips, small portions and NO SILVERWARE!! I don't know what year they won best carne asada but 2018 that meat was dry and flavorless. My husband almost chipped a tooth on the hard brown rice. NEVER NEVER AGAIN! So disappointing"}
{"text":"This was my first time here since they took over. My family and I really loved Las Fuentes and we were hesitant to try Yaya's because we thought no one could top the previous buffet. Well....I'm glad we did!! The service was amazing and the food was delicious, it was their Fathers Day brunch when we went.The menudo was my favorite and the beans. My dad, mom, grandma and daughter enjoyed everything they had as well. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was really not bad it was good. It did lack seasoning, mostly everything in the dinner platter I got was bland except for the ground beef tacos. those were delicious. A little bit of salt and pepper and it would have been amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 taco dish and a beer $20 . Tacos came plane with no toppings, I asked for guacamole ,99cents I for a teaspoon of guacamole not even enough for one taco Food was not so good and ridiculously overpriced. After the tip I was out $25 I could have gone to a nice restaurant and had a great meal for the same price ."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Yaya's because it's a new local owned business. Cynthia was our server and she was wonderful. I'm on a diet so I haven't had Mexican in a long time. I expected to get fajitas but to my surprise they have a specialty menu with healthy options. Gluten free tortillas, cauliflower rice, and main dishes like pollo Cancun. The food was great and now that I know I can stay on track with healthy eating we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"5 stars for service and a 4 for the food! Had no idea that this was a new returant with new owners. I ate at the previous place twice. Walk in and it's so much more opened and clean looking. The man who sat us was very nice.our server was great as well. Owner walking around chatting with tables is always a plus it shows they truly care!  Chips and salsa at the table right when we sat down! Drinks arrived quickly. Order was taken. My mom and I both got the pork Chile Verde burrito. I enjoyed mine. Served with rice and beans and beans on the inside of the burrito as well. They offer a mexican rice or califlower rice. I got the Mexican rice my mom got the califlower rice . I enjoyed mine but my mom didn't care for the califlower rice. Just wasn't her taste. We will come back to try more things! I was impressed for my first visit. They should add a lunch special menu. My mom couldn't eat all her burrito cuz it was just that big. Having a smaller lunch size would accomodate a lot more guests during lunch time! Nice to have a new Mexican food place! See ya soon Yaya's!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love their tacos!! The tacos remind me of the tacos you get when you go to Mexico. Can't beat yaya's great taste and adorable pricing!"}
{"text":"Loved having healthy options at a Mexican Food restaurant!! The service was quick and the food was delicious. We ordered the Albondigas soup and it can steamy hot in an enormous bowl along with a side of rice and tortillas. We also ordered the Pollo Cancun - the chicken was moist, perfectly seasoned and cooked. We forgot to ask for their cauli-rice and received their traditional rice, which was good but we wanted to try the cauli. We told our attentive waitress Patsy and she brought us a small bowl with two spoons for my husband and I so we could have a complimentary tasting! The cauli-rice has such great flavor and we would definitely be ordering it the next time we come back to try their other menu options. Oh and one last shout-out to Patsy for taking great care of us, checking in regularly and keeping our glasses full."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Yaya\"s on Monday, 3/5/18. Impressed with the food quality and table service. The margaritas however were just marginal. I look forward to eating there again for dinner."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and was completely disappointed. We had family from California visiting so we were trying to find a delicious Mexican spot to take them to. Our server was awesome! Other than that everything was disappointing. The food was greasy, lacked flavor, and my taquitos had a weird taste. Almost left a throw up after taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if it was a certain spice they used but I couldn't eat it! I feel awful leaving such a bad review because like I said our waiter was great, but I would NOT recommend this place to anyone! Definitely not authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Tried YaYa's Tacos out while they were up in Anthem.  I arrived just before they were closing up for the night and even though they were closing they made me some DELICIOUS quesadillas, cauliflower rice and beans....OH THE BEANS!  I highly recommend YaYa's Tacos to anyone that sees them out!  Thank you for being so accommodating."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant! Stopped by yesterday afternoon and inquired about Trivia that was advertised. Server assured us it started at 7:00. Returned at 6:50 to find there was NO Trivia and no explanation. Waited in bar for ten minutes to get served beverages (only 6 other customers in the bar and all had been served). Ordered a Quesadilla  and after 25 minutes the bartender apologized for not turning our order in to the kitchen! We will not return. You never get a second chance to make a first impression."}
{"text":"This isn't what I expected at all. Here is a place that serves traditional Mexican fare AND offers restaurant quality vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. 

I had three tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and jackfruit. What's that, you ask? I tried something new to me, jackfruit. At YaYa's, it's prepared to be an option for the meatless diets. The texture of pulled meat, a slightly fungi/nutritional yeast umami, along with slow cooked onions and tomatoes. 

It might not be the stuff I crave every day, but it'll be an option for my hipster friends when they come visit."}
{"text":"Yaya's was a fantastic meal last night.  Some of the best Mexican food we've eaten, and that is across the US.  A MAJOR plus is their Gluten Free friendly menu.

On top, the Cadillac Magaritta was superb... Grande Margne shot into the drink.....yummmm.

We are retired military.  Catch dinner and movie at the Metroplex 12 next door.

Kuodo's to our waitress, Batsy."}
{"text":"The staff, food, and atmosphere are great! I've thoroughly enjoyed the food every time I've been in!! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We went because they advertise gluten free.  When we were seated, chips and salsa arrived promptly.  I asked if they were gluten free. 2 wait staff told me they were fried in coconut oil.  After I repeatedly said what kind of oil does not make it gluten free, what else goes in the oil.  They keep stating gluten free.  Finally the manager came over and told me I could not eat the chips.  Chips and salsa is the start to a true Mexican food experience.  That ruined it at the start.  Then I chose the enchiladas suiza, which were gf on the menu. He told me he would have to ask if I could eat them because under the old name, they made all sauces with flour.  However he offered me jackfruit.  Seriously.  The owners need to train ALL wait staff and hostess on what gluten free means.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Whole experience was a joke first 45 min all we recieved was drinks before even being asked what we would like to order. Waiters constantly arguing, people got up and left. After ordering a second round of drinks which was made wrong, we finally got to order only to be told it will take another 45 min, we figured it must be really good if we have to wait that long so we agreed to wait.... Well i recieved a fajita plate with a crap load of onions and green bell pepper and a small piece of steak that tasted as if it was only seasoned with the McCormick seasoning pack.... Disappointment in itself. The second plate we ordered was a Burrito plate, it had no red sauce.. and the meat was tough and flavorless. We paid what we would at a steakhouse. Drive threw mexican food is so much better and far more price accurate! Disappointed and never going back, we already spread the word to friends and family and to anyone that ask!"}
{"text":"Basic, fresh, trendy catering to free spirited food lovers.  The beef taco with minced onions was savory and the chicken tacos were good.  The food is A-OK and their care about responsible sourcing and food issues kicks the experience up a notch.  

We found the truck at the Peoria Sports Complex on Friday night.  One of the great things about Yaya's is how kid friendly they are.  Depending on where you find them the kids don't need to sit still and there a lots of kid friendly food options."}
{"text":"I've  been to this restaurant three times since moving to AZ from Colorado. The first time was for Mother's Day for the Buffet... it was ok. The second time I wanted menudo and I remembered that they had it. Oh my gosh it was excellent!! The last time I went it sealed the deal. They have a bartender/waiter there named Damon. Holy cow this guy can mix some drinks that make you wanna slap somebody!!!  My husband and I had two drinks there he a whiskey sour and I a margarita. I cannot remember a time where I had a drink that I had to restrict myself from sucking it down in one drink, but this was it. He was funny, kind, attentive and his mixology was on point. When I go back (and we will) I will make sure he is working. That combined with the food will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Paleo Mexican food that is delicious! Esteban and Liz have taken food trucks to another level!! Amazing food and amazing people!!!!!  I would follow this truck anywhere!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food,drinks and portions!!!! Fabulous staff!!! So much better than any chain !!! Wonderful !!"}
{"text":"I decided to go out for may 5th. Knowing it was in the middle of the afternoon and YAYAS  was close to my house I just wanted a margarita  and fish tacos.   I got to the bar  including myself 7 at the bar and the dining approx 30 people.  The bartender poured me an already prepared marg and that was the last time we chatted until I requested my tab.  I was in that place  for about 45 min total. Even the owner came to talk to everyone. He and the bartender were more interested in the 3 almost under the table.  Here I am just waiting to be asked if I wanted a refill.  Any guys comes in waited 5 minute bartender saw him come in. Then his beer order was takes and the bartender looked at me and my empty plastic Dixie cup and NOTHING!! 

The owner says they bought the place in October  an no mex restaurants were doing anything even talking about future plans.  Patio and. Blocking off some of the parking lot for future events.   Good luck. You WONT HAVE MY MONEY!"}
{"text":"Great new favorite in the area.  My wife has food allergies to meat. They have awesome healthy vegetarian and vegan options.  But cater to all appetites. Yes for us meat eaters. The best part they don't kill the taste thinking the have to over season something since its vegetarian.  Perfect balance of health and taste. 

Met the owners and very happy to see the passion they have for great service and food."}
{"text":"This is going to be legnthy but I wanted to write this review after seeing some of the negative ones. I was a huge fan of Yaya's food truck for the last 2+ years.  Every time I ate off their food truck I would wait in line anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour. Thats how popular and good they are! So when I heard they were opening a restuarant in Surprise I was thrilled!!!! We have so many crappy chains that it was nice to get a locally owned restaurant that makes amazing food and uses quality ingredients.  My family and I were at their grand opening and it was obvious they were having some growing pains going from a food truck to a large resturant.  Service was very slow and food was good but not amazing like I got off their food truck. The restaurant was jam packed so it wasn't that big of a deal.  Since then I've been back 3 more times and I want to point out some inaccuracies in some of the reviews. 
1) Yaya's DOES offer gluten items. This is NOT a strictly gluten free restaurant. I do appreciate that they not only offer gluten free options like corn tortillas but they offer GRAIN FREE options like cassava taco shells. I don't know why they don't advertise their cassava taco shells but they should. They are amazing!!! My daughter cannot eat gluten or corn so their grain free option is what first attracted us to Yaya's . See the photo of their menu along with my father in-laws flour tortilla that clearly shows they offer gluten items. 

2) Their food is the farthest thing from greasy. I really feel like someone has it out for this restaurant and is having people post inaccurate and mean reviews. I have brought quite a few people here to eat and no one has ever complained of the food being greasy. See my attached photos of the amazing meals we had tonight. Not a drop of grease on those plates!!! 

3) Their chips always come out warm with the chips and salsa. Every time I eat there. The chips are homemade and cooked in coconut oil which I really appreciate for the health factor and taste.  There is no coconut or sweet taste. You just taste fresh chips. The salsa is also very good.

3) Their flavored margaritas are awesome! My husband and I each had a strawberry, banana margarita and it was perfect. 

4) This is a new restaurant so can we please cut them some slack?! I can tell that they are reading the negative reviews and they have made changes. Our service tonight was lightening fast! We ordered our kids' meals the moment we sat down and by the time the rest of us placed our order their food had arrived. They all cleaned their plates! Our server was really nice because my 5 year old was freaking out that salsa was on her rice. The server offered to bring a seperate bowl of rice for her and it arrived with-in minutes. My daughter was very pleased and then she did end up trying the rice with salsa. She said it was a little spicy but she liked it! Once the rest of our table ordered our food it arrived with-in 15 minutes. My in-laws were skeptical about coming with my husband and I tonight after reading the negative reviews. They LOVED their fajitas.  Portions were large and they said they have enough to take home for two more meals. They also ordered flour tortillas so again the people making stuff up in their review stating only GF foods are offered need to stop. My husband and I both ordered three tacos on Cassava shells. We got the carne asada and shredded pork along with the cauliflower lime rice.  Our tacos were incredibly flavorful and we loved the cauliflower rice.  This was the food that kept us waiting in line for an hour in their food truck!!! The cauliflower rice was not the stuff you buy at Trader Joes. It had a really great flavor.  Our tacos were tastier than the last 3 times we have been here.

Like I said these new owners are just getting into their groove being restaurant owners. If you have been here before give them another shot. If you have not been here yet you will not be disappointed! This is the type of restaurant you would normally find in Central Phoenix or Chandler (where all the good, non-chain restaurants seem to be). Lets show some love to this new, locally owned restaurant and not encourage another boring chain to take its place!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be a person to stalk a food truck, but I love Yaya's Tacos! They make the absolute best Paleo tortillas you will ever taste. I do miss the option to get cauliflower rice and beans (not Paleo, I know, but yummy), but the best street tacos in the world are worth tracking down this taco truck! I also buy their taco dough at Sprouts and make tortillas at home, but fixing all those taco ingredients is a lot of work! I'd rather stalk the truck!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for the grand opening and was very filling. The cauliflower hit the spot with the chicken tacos . For all those who have had bariatric surgery this is the food to give you the protein recommend by your doctor."}
{"text":"If you are considering the Father's Day Brunch, save your money. We did the Mother's Day Brunch and were disappointed. The buffet cart was messy and none of the items had names identifying what they were. The chicken pieces were tough as cardboard and tasteless. The enchiladas were mediocre. The rice was dried out and blah. The ham tasted like it had been boiled to death. There were a few other items that needed names to identify. People were letting their small children fix their own plates and were making a mess cross-mixing food on the buffet. The desserts were store bought. The omelet station was the only thing worth standing in line.
We had to ask twice for the mimosas that came with the brunch and they were blah.

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love Yaya's - We have always had an enjoyable experience. Our waiter and the rest of the staff as always been very attentive and a pleasure. 
The food doesn't disappoint but my favorite has to be their Chimi Grande. The best part is that it's on my side of town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Completely changed from initial opening. Give a second chance.  Lunch was busy but service from Robert was attentive and friendly.  Food was delicious and hot.  Will be coming back.   IGNORE the negative earlier reviews... YAYA's has stepped up their game, fantastic Service and Food."}
{"text":"The best tacos and their tortillas are the best tortillas I have ever had! Love that all the ingredients are local and organic and the food was super healthy! My new favorite food truck. We will definitely be following them around town!!"}
{"text":"Wholly buckets of nasty grease do not go to this place. 
It started off good chips and salsa. Then it went downhill from there.
I had this shrimp plate, shrimp came out floating in a tube of butter. I tried the cauliflower rice, all I have to say do not go there. My Wife shared an big appetizer with my mother. Best part of it was the canned jalapeños.  For a dinner two kids meals , 1 appetizer, and one margarita my bill was over $70. I have no intention on going back to this place at all. Had High hopes."}
{"text":"Friendly service 
Great chips and salsa! 
Have vegan options!! 
Even have jackfruit .. it was amazing!!  
Definitely recommend this new spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food made with fresh ingredients. Best chicken tortilla soup ever! Our server was friendly and attentive. I highly recommend Ya Ya 's! We will be back."}
{"text":"The staff was great, and our waiter was awesome; but the food lacked a lot of flavor. My carne asada burrito was the plainest I've ever had, my wife's taquito plate was something she did not enjoy, and my daughters carne asada plate looked great, but also lacked flavor. I would definitely try it again once improvements have been made."}
{"text":"I read a good article in the paper about this place and we decided to give it a try.   Wow, a waste of time and money.   There was barely any alcohol in the margaritas, the salsa was bland, the dinner was bland.   The lime cauliflower rice had no flavor at all.  The cost was outrageous considering the tasteless  food. Expensive!!!!"}
{"text":"Great and healthy food there is not a food truck around that serves healthy food keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Best tacos!! Both Esteban and Liz Garcia are great, they have great customer service and the food is not just delicious but also healthy, if you want keep up with your diet and also enjoy some great food yaya's tacos are the best."}
{"text":"They need to hire a new chef, the ground beef was dry and nobfoavor, the carne asada had no flavor, the caldo the res was blend. The chimichaga with shredded chicken was tasteless. The service was good."}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful place to dine. The food is fantastic and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"We went for dinner at Yaya's today and it was probably the worst Mexican I've ever had.  I would rather eat Taco Bell.  Seriously.  The corn tortillas were too thin, saturated in oil to the point that they didn't stay together,  the pork was dry, the hard corn taco shells were deep fried and stale tasting, and the shrimp was just gross.  Even my Diet Coke was flat, and they were unable to fix that.  The one good thing was the guacamole, it was creamy and very tasty.  Not tasty enough to make up for the rest of the meal though."}
{"text":"Zeek an was absolutely awesome server! The vegan burrito was fantastic we added the cauliflower rice. The dish came with beans and rice It was perfect size to split that and still feel plenty full when added with the chips and guacamole. Get the sides of Guac they are 1.99 per(we got one for each of us)  instead of the 8.99 appetizer) appetizer size is too much... and I love Guac!

My first time here I got the Jackfruit fajitas for 1... They can definitely be for two or makes a great lunch the next day. Dont forget to bring your own take out containers, if you are like me and always take left overs. 

I am so thankful for good Mexican food that has Vegan options. You have options for gluten free as well. We will be back again soon! Oh yeah and margaritas are $5 during lunch !"}
{"text":"Great food great place to for Mexican food! A must stop if you are on this side of town but definitely worth the drive"}
{"text":"Stopped in during the grand opening to try out the new restaurant. Food and staff were great. The owners are awesome people and go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. We had several different meals at the table and everything I tasted was very good. Having healthy options also makes Yaya's very unique."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food outside of Mexico! If you haven't been here you are missing out! Very, very good chili Verde. We are going to go back again soon."}
{"text":"We order the enchiladas suizas, no flavor everything tastes canned Not fresh too much cheese for my taste , the caldo de res had way too many carrots was too sweet ,not  fresh at all, the nachos were not good either , 
Pretty expensive for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the breakfast eggs, chorizo and potatoes. It was delicious. There paleo coffee was great tasting too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times since they took over. Only one issue came up when a friend of mine got sick from what appeared to be food poisoning. Thought it might be a fluke but then me and my fiance ate there on Sunday 5/27/18 and both of us have gotten violently ill. I noticed service has gone down some starting with having to wait for someone to notice we were standing up front waiting to be seated. If I'm not better by tomorrow  i'll be going to the Dr before I die. I think they may consider just serving from a food truck like they did before. Ya Ya is no laughing matter. Eat at your own risk.

Response to owner: The food we had in common was the chips and salsa. She had some shrimp combo meal that she say didn't smell just right (she should have stopped eating right there) with the cauliflower rice and I had a carne asada burrito with beans and rice. No, I didn't reach out to your staff other than my comments on Yelp. I've just missed 1/2 day at work and it's gonna be more because it isn't better today and I haven't been able to keep any food in my body, so I'll be going to the Dr. As to my other issue, I almost walked out because I was waiting to be seated but nobody was watching the door and we had to wait until somebody from the bar stopped talking and finally looked up to see we were standing there. During other visits somebody was always waiting up front to meet guests and seat them."}
{"text":"Chips are the best!  The option for healthy alternatives for traditional mexican food is great option with no loss in taste. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"First time having paleo tacos and they were amazing!  I was impressed and my two young kids loved the cauliflower rice."}
{"text":"These may have been the absolute worst tacos I have ever had in my entire life! Not only way over priced for the quality but not very good taste. I was at the Dodgers-Indians Spring training game, they were parked there, they had run out of all meat except ground beef, which I was still ok with. They had these tacos priced at 3 for $12...$4 a taco, I'm far from a cheapskate and I understand this is a taco truck but I didn't expect to get the McDonald's burger of tacos for $4. Not only was the tortilla not cooked all the way thru the meat was cold. It was a very poor presentation, I didn't feel dealing with them as we were walking out and I didn't want to return to deal with it. I got the feeling that they were more concerned with squeezing out more money before the night was over than presenting a good product. If you have to choose between this taco truck and $1 hot dog take the dog!"}
{"text":"Had the please of eating these tasty treats after a workout and fell in love!!!!
Anytime YAYA's comes around my pocket book will open!"}
{"text":"Awesome wholesome paleo tacos by some awesome people. Highly recommend all three tacos and the Bulletproof coffee!  The paleo tortillas were great!!"}
{"text":"You guys I have been dying to try this place since I knew they now had this location and not just the food truck.  One of my friends and I were out today so we had to stop and check it out. We were welcomed right away with a smile and seated. Our drink orders were taken and chips and salsa brought to our table. The chips were still warm and perfect. The salsa was fresh and my friends son practically ate the whole bowl before we could blink lol. I really loved how the waiter was so attentive and great with interacting with the kids. It's hard to go out for my friend with having a two year old and 8 month old so it was nice to see. Our food came out very quickly. I ordered three street tacos rice and beans. One with steak, chicken  and carnitas per the waiters recommendation and they did not disappoint. Usually with street tacos a lot of places skimp on either meat or toppings, but these were overflowing and not only tasted amazing, but looked picture perfect. My friend ordered Pork chili verde , and her son had a tostada kids meal with chicken and it was HUGE. of course he couldn't eat it all, but he really tried his best because he loved it. We were never rushed and were able to sit and talk a bit when we were done. Before we left the owner even came by and introduced himself and wanted to check how everything was. To me that says a lot about the love for their customers and food. If you haven't been go check them out and suppo"}
{"text":"Walked in to try this place tonight a little before 8p. I had heard from people during spring training it is pretty good. No one in the restaurant. No one at the bar, no bartender either and no one at or around hostess station. We gave it a few, looked over the menu. Still no one came out so we left. First impression was non existent which is the worst kind. Moving on."}
{"text":"Went to eat here the other day. Took almost an hour for some soup and quesadilla. If you could only imagine how hard it would be to have a salsa that isn't good imagine no more this food is straight garbage and the staff is slow as heck too. I knew something was wrong when it was dinner time and no one else was in there. The only thing I can't figure out is why it took so long to get the food. Anyways if your looking for good Mexican this place makes Taco Bell seem like a 5 star restaurant"}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant when it was Las Fuentes and typically the food was good and served hot and the service was also typically good.  We stopped in shortly after the new owners took over before they changed the name and menu and we were not impressed.  The tacos were cold and the service was lackluster.  We met the owner and he was nice enough and so we decided to give it another try tonight seeing it was the \"Grand Opening\" under the new name.  We waited for quite some time to be seated even though there was only one group of 6 ahead of us and multiple empty tables.  It took forever to get our food - I ordered a chimichanga plate and my husband ordered 3 carne asada tacos only cheese and meat.  We asked for more chips but we requested them be hot and the waiter said he would have to ask the cook if he would do that because they were so busy (there were empty tables) and before he could have even asked the cook (within seconds) another man brought us out a basket of cold chips.  Our request was never addressed so cold chips for us I guess.  When the food arrived my husband's tacos were tiny and had barely any cheese, they were cold and dry.  My beans tasted almost soapy and the chimi had a very small amount of shredded beef -- it was mostly all beans.  And my rice and beans were barely warm.  We ordered for my son who came later and after 35 minutes waiting for 2 ground beef tacos with rice we gave up and went to the front to cancel the order for the tacos and pay.  The server comes running up with the food but at that point we didn't want it -- decided just to hit Taco Bell for him.  We told the waiter it was ridiculous to wait 35 minutes for 2 tacos and he argued with us stating how busy they were because they had one large party of maybe 15 people that were eating already when we came in.  Let's be honest here -- the taco ground beef mix is not made to order.  How hard was it to scoop some into two shells and throw on some cheese and a spoonful of rice??  35 minutes?  Way too long. She tried to charge my card for the food we ate and then walked away and then came back and was mumbling something about how it didn't go through because they didn't do something in the backroom right.  I told her I wanted to pay and she said no that's fine your fine.  So I didn't pay for the meal which was sub-par along with the service.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"5 Stars for Yaya's! I walked in an was greeted by the very friendly staff. The wait time was not too long and we were seated right away. The menu was nice and simple with Gluten free & Vegetarian options. Chips & Salsa were very tasty, The Shredded Beef Burrito was excellent, my wife kept picking at my plate. Then I picked at her plate and tried the Chimis, great....The taquitos, great....and the quesadillas, great! The Restaurant was clean, had great service, and overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"The rice was raw, shrimp was swimming on a deep oil dish very unpleasant food , since they changed   owners this place is not a hot spot anymore we will not go back again . This is the second try . the first time  the services was bad also, food cold and you have a lady running around doing nothing ."}
{"text":"Nice place with good amount of gluten free and vegetarian and vegan options. The free chips and salsa were average. Wife ordered nachos with jack fruit and they were ok. Jack fruit was a little too strong on the spice side. I ordered the albondigas (meatball) soup with a side of Spanish rice. I liked it. Waiter was top notch."}
{"text":"We went to Yaya's thinking it was Las Fuentes Mexican Grill & found it had changed owner's & changed it name to Yaya's Mexican Bar & Grill. We decided to try Yaya's. We will not be back, ever. We both ordered from the Combinations Dinners, any 2 for $12 each! This is steep when Las Fuentes sold \"any 2 Combo Dinners for $11 each. We both had ground beef tacos that were too salty & we could not finish due to the horrible taste. I had the bean Tostada & it was burnt! The only good thing was the cheese enchilada. We miss the old Las Fuentes & want it back!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I all stopped in for brunch.  Wow  were we impressed.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I can appreciate a restaurant having some gluten free options as well, this is a huge bonus in my family as my daughter and I have food allergies.  The cauliflower rice and tacos were delicious.  By far the best I've ever had.  They were not greasy and were well seasoned.  My mouth is watering just writing this review of the tacos.  We are making this restaurant one of our new faves on the westside.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the food. The service was great and the chips and salsa were fine enough but the food had no taste. My tacos were greasy and so bland. The beans and rice were completely flavorless. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we were really looking forward to supporting a fellow Crossfitter at our gym tonight. Advertised and promoted this event. Their trailer was damaged due to the storm over the weekend. We emailed and called last night trying to confirm they were still on for tonight since we hadn't heard anything from them. We were then informed they would not be able to make it. Poor business practice to have the customer calling the night before the event and not communicating with us as soon as the problem presented itself. We now get to tell all of our members that were looking forward to this event today that it has been cancelled. We will not be doing business with these guys in the future. We understand things happen but communication is key! Afraid they might have waited until right before the actual event to cancel on us if we hadn't contacted them."}
{"text":"For someone who has struggled with food allergies for quite some time, and I must say that it is a breath of fresh air to have found YaYa's! !  Thank you for a gluten free menu and alternative for rice, but most of all thank you for hiring one of the best bartenders I have ever had the privilege of knowing! Damon constructs artful drinks that tantalize the taste buds, erupting them into a glorious taste bud dance! With his amazing drinks he can easily get a certification in Mixology!  Great food, awesome service, and the most delightful drinks!!  #YaYasrocks"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. They use cassava flour to make them so the tortilla is gluten free and tastes better than any other tortilla i have ever had. Totally recommend them. This is a moving food truck so the location on the map is not correct. Check out their Facebook and twitter for their up to date location"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!  Love the ground beef tacos and cauliflower rice!( so flavorful )
The owners and staff are friendly and helpful for all your requests
We stumbled on this place after going to uptown alley for bowling with friends.... what a convenient place for grabbing some delicious Mexican food whether going bowling or going to the movies... full bar with yummy lunch and drink specials!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say?! Today, we had Yaya's out to provide food for an event we were having. They showed up on time and despite a few minor hiccups (not on their behalf - someone hit their truck) they still provided great service and beyond delicious tacos! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I come here usually once a week but this is my first review, as someone who is not gluten free or paleo I can say that their food is excellent for us normals also. I usually have the green chili burrito and it is excellent. I have also had the carnitas burrito which I felt was darn good too. Don't hesitate to give them a try. Very friendly service also."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times always in a hurry to get to a movie and always impressed I got out quickly with great food!"}
{"text":"Gluten free. One of the few places i can eat. Sunday buffet all you can eat. Wonderful selecton. Lots if gluten free. Everything is made fresh.buffett incudes 2 mimosas. Very reasonable at 15.99. I recomend highly."}
{"text":"Well, the dining room was empty when we walked in around five on a Saturday. It wasn't a good sign. 

Their salsa tasted like it was made with canned tomatoes but fresh cilantro. The margarita was cheap margarita mix with a splash of tequila in it for $7.00. 

The plate of nachos was enormous and they were ok. The employees were really nice, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Two and done. Horrible. We gave this place a second chance, bad decision, again. I had 3 carne asada tacos with cheese only. Nothing else. 40 plus minutes later I received the three smallest tacos I ever ordered, with barely any cheese. On top of that, they were way over cooked and cold. I also requested some fresh hot tortillas chips. What I received, 2 seconds later, cold chips. No effort what so ever. Very disappointed. I had better tacos in the midwest."}
{"text":"The Fran Tacos were super yummy and flavorful! You wouldn't even know the tortillas were paleo friendly."}
{"text":"I was not really impressed with the prior Mexican restaurant (Las Fuentes) at this location. However, I decided to try YaYa's as they now have Team Trivia on Thursday evenings. I was pleasantly surprised. Reasonable Happy Hour prices which were honored during the Team Trivia Game (thank you!). We had the Nachos w/chicken and the Chicken Quesadilla. Both were fantastic. The hostess, Gracie, was extremely friendly as was the bartender who also waited on our table. It was nice to see the hostess being vigilant on cleaning off tables and asking if we needed anything when she wasn't busy greeting guests."}
