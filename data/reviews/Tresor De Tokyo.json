{"text":"This place is completely under-rated. Very good quality sushi, just as good as Maiko on sources, however half the price. They spend less on the decor and pass the savings on to you. The next big thing is the fact it's a bring your own wine! It's impossible to find a good sushi wine bar. I would strongly suggest trying this restaurant out. I go once every couple of months and get my sushi fix. Here are some photos from my last meal, ordering an assortment of specialty maki sushi."}
{"text":"Still my only sushi go to place!! Bring your own wine, extraordinary specialties decently priced and always welcoming and friendly service!! I love it!!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 decor 3/5 staff&service 5/5
Had so my different sushi options there! The waiter just asked us what we didn't eat and worked around that. The service was quick, food was fresh and very well presented and prices were very good! Only wish the decor was slightly better decorated."}
{"text":"Always enjoy our meals at Tokyo's.  The specialty sushis are amazing, and the regular menu is really good too.  There's some good Teriyaki and tempura for non-sushi eaters too.  Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Have to disagree with the last reviewer.  Sushi is edible, selection small, decor is dated.  Be warned; no alcohol!!!!  Server smelled like smoke so if your a non smoker it is annoying when she comes close to you and you have to smell that smoke."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with a friend. The was great as usual. We shared avocado, spicy salmon, dragon balls and the strawberry and banana maki with chocolate sauce. The service was exceptionally slow. We waited too long for the dishes, serving plates which they forgot to give us and the bill."}
{"text":"I've had sushi pretty much everywhere: LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Puerto Vallarta, Montreal, Toronto, New York. I've been to the best places in most of these cities, including San Fran and Vegas. My favorite sushi restaurant in the world is Tresor de Tokyo. That says a lot.

Make sure to ask for the specialties that are not on the menu, like the 3-fish tartar (shaped like a heart)."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer and they never disappoint me or my family. The entree Tokyo salad is my start off to a good meal with their delicious secret salad dressing! Mmmm, absolutely mouthwatering, it has you wanting more. As for the special dishes, they truly are what it says: \"special\"! Magnificently put together, and each piece you put into your mouth, is like heaven. Your taste buds will go wild! It's absolutely amazing, along with what others have said, it is Bring your own Wine! So hey! That's a bonus!"}
{"text":"I went to Tokyo with my family tonight and had a great night. It is a bring your own wine but unfortunately we forgot about this. Next time we'll be sure to bring as wine makes all food better! We ordered 4 different specialty rolls and a standard roll called \"temptation\". All were made without seaweed as I'm not a huge fan. We also ordered shrimp tempura and edamame to start. The shrimp was mediocre but the edamame was yummy. All the sushi was absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. 
The service was quick however not overly friendly. The prices are reasonable but obviously on the pricier end cause we are talking about sushi.

Food 5/5
