{"text":"J Pistone is aiming to be something it's not, or at least not succeeding at doing.  It looks like they're trying to be an upscale specialty grocery, which in this instance basically means not all that much on the shelves and what is there is marked up even from an overpriced joint like Whole Foods, and can be found fairly easily elsewhere.

 Stopped in here for some picnic supplies since it was an unseasonably warm November afternoon, and ventured to their deli counter and ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich special that day.  It was billed as grilled chicken breast with roasted peppers, caramelized onions and BBQ sauce on some fancy grilled bread (can't remember what they called it).  $7.50 later, I get a small sandwich with cold cuts and cold toppings.  The bread might've been grilled at some point, but by the time it got to me, it was far from that state.  Wouldn't have been bummed if the samich only cost $4-5 bucks, but as it was I felt ripped.

  The place was fairly busy when I was there, full of moms with giant strollers and older ladies who fell in the perfume bottle.  Apparently this place is a hit with that crowd, but if you're not made of dough / know better, keep on movin' down the road."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious.  Sandwiches and the deli salads were great.  Sandwiches run about $7ea and they give you a little pasta salad with it.  Desserts were superb.  Days later, I was still craving the desserts (~$3 a slice)."}
{"text":"Never order anything that requires any thinking or coordination-------------any time a problem occurs, its your fault and every jump ball goes to them, expensive and dismal service"}
{"text":"Great wraps and salads.  Like the beverage selection including many different kinds of pop like orange cream soda"}
{"text":"J Pistone is in my neighborhood, and all the better for it. I am serously shocked by the lack of eateries in Shaker proper. So there's a handful of chain casual places on Van Aken and on Chagrin, but where are the charming bistros and cafes that one would expect? There's certainly enough rich to support them.

Anway, Pistone's salads and sandwiches are quite good. I love the salad with julienned zuchini and fresh corn. Likewise, the panini are fresh and tasty. 

The atmos? A little awkward,a little frumpy -- but who cares -- it's more of a neighborhood hangout. The wine selction is nice if you're in a pinch for dinner and need a nicer bottle. I was thrilled to see vin santo, but the price for a 1/2 bottle was redic. overinflated."}
{"text":"The Asiago Roast Beef and Turkey Reuben was SOOO good. My husband liked his a lot but thinks it's too pricey for what you get -- I think cost is on par with Panera. 

Good portions, but disappointed in the little side dish we got -- beets! Neither my husband or I like beets so we kinda lost out on having a side dish. BUT, we gave it to his mom who doesn't love beets but will eat it and she thought it was great! She even took the little bit of leftovers (like 2 spoonfuls) home...so I guess it must've been some beets!   

We pick up a lemon square everytime, very yummy!!

What's pretty cool about this place is they sell deli meat so if we missed going to Giant Eagle for lunch foods then we can just get it here since we live in walking distance."}
{"text":"Recently had a delicious lunch here!  Many, many vegetarian items (I had the quinoa wrap - it was wonderful).  Great atmosphere, outdoor cafe and oh my, the desserts!  This is a great spot for a casual lunch.  Super convenient to Thornton Park to get a take out picnic before taking a dip in the pool!"}
{"text":"The food is overpriced. Some employees are exceptionally nice some are rude. I definitely don't frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!! Quaint with a friendly staff. Lots of options for food and drink. I had a pesto pistachio salmon with veggie side. EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the packed eating area at neighborhood market, bakery and food service mecca J Pistone's.  Our table had a wrap that was pronounced excellent; lobster bisque that was exceptionally creamy; and a salad that was healthy in portion size.  It's hard to resist their bakery offerings - so I didn't!"}
{"text":"Great food and a kind staff. What more could you ask for? I really loved the lobster bisque and the French macaroons were delicious. I've lived near by my whole life and had somehow never heard of J Pistone until now, this will definitely become a regular spot! :)"}
{"text":"I tried the lobster bisque based on another yelpers recommendation, it was a savory sensation. I actually wish I would've bought some to take home. Bummer. I also tried the Greek Village Salad, it was very fresh and delightful. It's a cute little market, a bunch of products to browse while your waiting for your food. They have a huge selection of delicious looking prepared salads, side dishes, and entree items. They also have sandwiches, which sounded awesome, especially the turkey Reuben. Yum! 

They have a great wine collection and a large array of pastries. From checking in I received a free zucchini and carrot muffin, which for me was very moist, but a bit too oily for my liking. 

Overall, J Pistrone's is a great lunch spot, a bit pricy, but a lot of fresh items to choose from. If I lived in the area, I would definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are a little steep. But I'm upset because this place charges customers for wifi after one hour of free use!! Is this a local cafe/lunch spot? Or a flight on united airlines?? I could easily spend hours here doing homework and other internet related things. But I leave after 1 hour. You guys need to change that ASAP. Even a McDonald has free wifi? Why be so petty to try and make some extra money from internet use, when if it was free, I could easily spend more money here on food and beverages?!!! Disappointing."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good, fresh food but ridiculously overpriced. We purchased a few chicken breasts ($6 a piece), veggies, a couple Mac n cheese squares, 2 drinks and 4 macaroons and the total bill was $80. We weren't informed of the prices until the food was packaged and weighed (our mistake for not asking at the time of selection).  Afterwards, I wished we had just gone to a nice sit down dinner at a white table restaurant for the same price (or likely, less). Sorry to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I wasn't ENTIRELY impressed with this place...

Until I ate my lemon curd cookie at home later that night.

But, let me rewind and start from the beginning. A friend and I wanted to try out lunch in her new neighborhood and she said she had been eyeballing this place for awhile. I consulted Yelp, of course, and headed over after work. When we got there, we were starving (Google maps doesn't give the BEST directions =/) and overwhelmed by the variety of tasty options. We asked the man behind the counter for suggestions; at this point, my brain was slowing down in great need of sustenance. I got a chipotle turkey wrap or something like that and it was ok. A little bland for the price, but still yummy. The little dabble of cabbage salad that came with it was superb--I kind of want the recipe (I love cabbage!). When we were done eating, we had been thinking about the desserts for awhile at this point and really wanted some, but couldn't cram it in our stomachs, so we got them to go. 

Upon texting each other later, we found that the desserts were more impressive than the lunch foods. Or at least that's how I feel. I adore lemon desserts and this lemon curd cookie changed me. I can't handle lemon bars anymore. Lemon curd cookies from J Pistone are the way to go!  

The atmosphere here is unusual and fun. The tiny little dining area makes you feel like you're in a tiny cafe, but then you look the other direction and there's a wall of wine and scone mixes! Strangely cute!"}
{"text":"A great little neighborhood stop. Excellent sandwiches and soups! Have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"I recently went to a party that was catered by J. Pistone.  I had never heard of the place and was so amazed at how good the food was!  Everything was delicious and the catering staff was great."}
{"text":"Ham panini wasn't a true panini and didn't have the advertised ingredients (said Brie on menu but received Gouda) but nonetheless delicious. I ended up getting a lot of things to go like the brownie pillow cookie and a pumpkin glazed cookie. All were universally liked. Cool little spot whether you want to meet someone and grab a quick lunch or pick up some pre-made things like mini quiche, grilled salmon or chicken, lots of side salads, and bakery goodies. Nice wine selection as well."}
{"text":"J Pistone's food is amazing and Joan is a great hostess. Their craft beer selection is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great handling of large bakery order from email communication to ready at the appointed time of pick up! All items individually wrapped and labeled which was a huge bonus! From what I saw of deli and wine selection I'll definitely use them to cater again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food and staff are great.

Also just learned that on Saturday's after 4pm, the most food is 25% off.
This will be my regular Saturday evening stop"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to discover J Pistone. My boyfriend and I have gotten into a habit of stopping here on the way home from the gym to grab a healthy, not too heavy, but delicious lunch! 

It's great because you can order at the counter--either one of the day's specials, including delicious soups and rotating sandwiches/wraps, pre-made food (my boyfriend loves the apricot chicken and the marinated salmon with roasted veggies on the side), or one of the sandwiches/wraps or salads from the menu. I've tried most of the sandwiches and wraps at this point, and one of my favorite things is that each one comes with a different, small side salad, usually with a grain like quinoa or barley as the base. 

After you eat, you bring your number to the cashier and pay. This has been great for us as we are often quite hungry just having come from working out! The whole process is streamlined, the staff/cooks are friendly, and it's a light-filled, cheery place to eat. That's the \"gathering\" part--the small \"market\" is fun as well! They have a selection of wines, beers, and specialty food items. 

Also, the desserts look delicious and there is a free muffin offer on Yelp when you check in for the first time!

My only complaints aren't even real complaints, just suggestions for J Pistone. It would be nice to see a bigger selection of specialty food items, more like Southport Grocery in Chicago. There is space to have more! Also, some of the food portions could be a bit bigger, but then again, this is the perfect place to fuel up after those workouts and not feel TOO full afterward. 

If you live in or drive through Shaker Heights regularly, you should be a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little bistros.  It's located in the heart of Shaker Heights and the food is never disappointing. They have soups, sandwiches,  side dishes and desserts. Everything that I've ever tried  from the eggplant rotini to the asparagus frittata has been absolutely wonderful. They have a great wine selection to purchase by the bottle and they also offer catering. This is a spot that I like to go to for lunch with a good book and relax. The staff is friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"Regarding catering - during the past month my daughter & I  have made more than  a half dozen calls to J. Pistone requesting a quote for catering my daughter's wedding, we still have not received anything.  I think this does not speak well of her professionalism or catering company."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in the middle of Shaker heights. I met someone here for a business lunch.  The atmosphere is a little --- borrowing the word from another reviewer--frumpy. It could be so much better but instead it just feels like a gigantic room with awkward tables.

The food--for the most part-- is pretty good.  I got a wrap and they made it fresh and didn't skimp on ingredients.  The side pasta dish was a little odd (tasted like it was tossed in a pre-made peanut sauce with sea same seeds).

The employees were incredibly hospitable-- you can tell that it's a very community friendly lunch place."}
{"text":"Joanie and crew do great take out catering and lunch service. Worth a visit. Closed Sunday."}
{"text":"This is our favorite stop to visit in Shaker.
Excellent food  and great employees.
Love it."}
{"text":"J Pistone has great customer service and prepared foods. I've been here a few times for breakfast and lunch, and everyone I've interacted with has been so friendly. They have some yummy cafe food, great desserts, and great prepared foods. Their goat cheese mac is delicious, and their pastries and baked goods are beautiful and delicious as well. 

I haven't really explored their wine selection, but I do love the ambiance that it provides in the cafe area. J Pistone is an adorable addition to Shaker Heights and I'm looking forward to exploring more of what they offer!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe/market carrying mostly Italian items.  It is not cheap by Cleveland standards, but it is not terribly expensive either.  It has good baked goods, and although the selection is not that extensive, it does offer some imported products for sale that can be hard to find elsewhere, at least in the immediate vicinity.  It even sells some beer and wine.

It has a very pleasant atmosphere with a nice view of the street in a pleasant neighborhood, and is a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee or a light lunch."}
{"text":"You are sure to enjoy the super yummy food, the great fun outdoorsy café atmosphere and the variety of choices on their menu. This is a must come back to, tell your friends all about it kind of place. :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food and very friendly staff.  The lobster bisque is the best I've ever had.  All their offerings are delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and creative menu items! Get the lobster bisque and I enjoyed the chicken Brie panini too! Crowded parking lot at lunch but spacious market with lots of tables and patio seating."}
{"text":"Rude owners and the food is not that good..I've had better."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I'm up for a great cafe-type food selection, or simply a home style \"gourmet\" meal. Sandwiches and wraps are great. Don't miss out on their Lobster Bisque!!!
But the service is the real jewel at this place. Professional, friendly and warm!"}
{"text":"Breakfast with Taylor great food. Usually have lunch here. This is the first time for breakfast. Very good coffee and bran muffin. He had egg, cheddar cheese, ham and bacon on grilled multi-grain bread"}
{"text":"We recently purchased a Pistone's flourless chocolate cake. It was beautifully decorated with whip cream and strawberries. The cake was a great success with our guests. It was intensely delicious!"}
{"text":"I have only tried their decadent desserts so far and they are delicious! The hubby's fav is the brownie pillow ($2) Basically a brownie baked into a chocolate chip cookie.  Mine is the opera cake ($4) Honestly, I buy cheap wine at the grocery store so I haven't tried out their well sized wine selection nor have I tried their prepared foods yet. But they look delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place - one of the best local eateries in Shaker. We've also used them for catering special events at our home and they do an outstanding, professional and delicious job. Love to come to their restaurant for lunch or a quick coffee with a friend. I also order quite a lot of their prepared foods to take home for dinner. Some have said it's a bit expensive - it is not cheap, but the food is high-quality, very good and their bakery items are to die for.  When I go to heaven (which is questionable), I want to be greeted by St. Peter holding a J. Pistone carrot cake."}
{"text":"Joan assisted me in delivering a welcome basket for some friends moving into their new Shaker Heights home.  The food was amazing and Joan delivered a wonderful surprise.  Thank YOU!"}
{"text":"We had a casual dinner at our home on Saturday, and the guests all commented on the great food provided by Pistone's. 

We had eaten at Pistone's but had not used them for catering. For our dinner planning, we met at the Market with John and sampled a few times, and then prepared a menu. Joan suggested a few changes, and we are glad she did! Everything she suggested \"fit\" together very well. The last thing I want is to have friends over for dinner and not have enough food or drink. Joan was very helpful in selecting the appropriate quantity for each selection, no one went hungry!

A few of my guests are very tough critics, and they both felt the salmon was some of the best salmon they ever tasted. 

I would not hesitate to recommend J. Pistone!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood cafe. Service was excellent and food came out fast. I had Lobster bisque and the Asiago beef panini.  The bread and cous cous side with the soup and sandwich really complimented the plates well. Wine and other drinks available for sale as well as coffee and specialty bakery."}
