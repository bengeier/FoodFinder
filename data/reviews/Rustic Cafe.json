{"text":"good food, busy, popular, nice portions and good coffee.  really nice, friendly staff, but they were yelling at each other!!  we sat in the middle of the restaurant and couldn't help but hear them-to the kitchen staff, keep your gripes down to a whisper out back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my family! Pretty good service, I'd say it all depends on the waitress/waiter. Some are faster than others. But the food is absolutely delicious! I had ONE banana walnut pancake and it was very filling! I could only finish half!! There food does come in giant portions. This cafe is really nice though and had a good vibe when you walk in"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of a hole in the wall breakfast place. This place is certainly a little nicer than a little breakfast dive. I had the Greek omelet and the Cajun breakfast potatoes. It was a decent meal and large portions. The staff was friendly and the service was fast. There are unique art pieces on the walls that are actually for sale. I am in town visiting my parents and they come once a week. My dad always gets the breakfast sandwich with fruit and absolutely loves it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Eric the chef owner has a vast creative and tasty menu. Been here several times and plan to keep coming back. If you are looking for a place to make your taste buds happy for breakfast or lunch, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment now a few times in the past month.  Was looking for a new place to try. I must say I like the setup and location. The menu has a wide variety of choices, side dishes and the prices are VERY reasonable. The discount offered for paying cash is a nice incentive.  The quality of the food overall is 5 stars. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating overall is due to the fact service in my opinion is very mediocre. After being seated had to wait nearly 10 minutes before being greeted at table. Following drink order it took several minutes to be served beverages. I actually believe the server forgot. The ladies sitting across from me had been seated and greeted..but no one had taken their drink order either. The woman actually had gotten up to find someone. 1 out of the 2 entrees were prepared correctly. I have seen the owner here around and about but has never said hi or asked how things were. I will go back but my advice would be to train the servers the basics and be a little more personable. Great menu and food but poor service will catch up adventually."}
{"text":"Figured we'd come in for lunch today, opposed to ordering and dining out, and were absolutely appalled by their lack of customer service.   The dining area was mostly empty, just a few people having lunch. However, we were seated right under the TV that was blasting the news. We asked to move, so we aren't right under the TV. The waitress said, \"alright\", but remained standing there. We moved ourselves to another seat where the noise of the news in an otherwise silent area wasn't so intensive. After sitting down the waitress says we cannot sit there since they just mopped/are mopping... So we asked that the channel be changed or the TV turned down, to which the waitress responded, \"There are other customers, like this gentleman right here [gesturing to an uninvolved party]. Maybe they want to watch it.\" At that point we declared that we are just going to leave and she rebutted, \"Good, you should leave, please leave then. You clearly aren't Christians with that behavior.\" I addressed her accusation very calmly informing her that while it is true we don't identify as Christian that should not be a requirement to eat there in the event that we don't want to hear the news. We left after that and will definitely not be coming back considering they mess up takeout orders 9/10 times and the quality of the food is inconsistent. Even in an area where food options are few, I'd recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really like the Rustic Burrito with the Jalapeño sauce they serve with it. Rustic is an awesome little place if you need good hearty breakfast and a quiet atmosphere to get a little work done. There seems to always be a group or two of regulars having breakfast solving the worlds problems when I go in for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it is very close to my house and very affordable! The decor is nice. I have eaten here 3 times, and the quality has always been top notch. My only complaint is that the service can be a little slow, so it may not be the best place if you need a quick meal.  Their homemade country fried steak is awesome, either as a breakfast or lunch item.   I will definitely be returning! Thank you :-)"}
{"text":"I sat on the patio and ordered a Rustic Burrito. It was huge, and my tum tum was feeling very full but the ingredients were so delicious and the burrito so expertly crafted I ate the entire thing anyway. The Jalapeño aioli was perfect on every single bite, and the raisin toast I smuggled from my lunchmate's plate was delicious as well.  I like the signs in the restaurant, mostly because I am a sucker for puns. Even though my life partner was a butthole and made the staff clear a table on the patio they were still friendly and there wasn't a sign of disdain or despair."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this. I tried to handle this privately, via email and received no response from the owner.  I live around the corner from Rustic Café and work very close as well. We frequently (several times a week) order breakfast for the office.  In recent weeks, we have had severe issues with the food quality, quality of service and care taken with our orders.  Undercooked, overcooked, incorrectly prepared, or just plain incorrect, the expense of eating here, when not being able to actually eat our meals due to meat being dangerously undercooked, French fries being frozen and bacon being burnt to charcoal status makes it difficult to support a small business who clearly doesn't care."}
{"text":"This place not only offers standard breakfast and lunch fare but also specialty dishes, with many healthy options. We were seated promptly on a busy Saturday morning and didn't have to wait long for our server to warmly greet us and take our order. Our meals were then brought out in about 15 minutes. Service by the waitstaff was always amiable and attentive.   I was pleasantly surprised by the Enchilada Skillet for breakfast, which was fresh, out of the ordinary, and enjoyable. My husband liked his Chicken Fried Steak, although he admitted he had had better at other restaurants.   My only complaint is the main seating area is excessively noisy - the floors are hardwood and the walls are tile, so voices of everyone in the room reverberate off these hard surfaces. If you're looking for a quiet place during busy mealtimes, you will most likely be distracted by the amplified noise."}
{"text":"We ate at Rustic Cafe on Friday afternoon for lunch. The food was excellent. I ordered the cranberry chicken salad sandwich. It was quite tasty! My only complaint is that it was a little heavy on the mayo...probably pretty caloric - great flavors though. My boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries which were both really good as well. Prices are reasonable at about $20 for two people for lunch. We'll be back again sometime soon!  :)     (BTW, I agree with a previous reviewer - there is nothing \"Rustic\" about the interior decor this cafe. Instead it reminds me of an attempt at a retro diner that they didn't get quite right... with the obnoxious multi-colored tile on the walls and the bad curtains? The decor leaves me confused. But it won't deter me from eating here again.)"}
{"text":"My Husband and I have ate here a few times for breakfast and will continue to do so. We've tried something new every time and always love it. They have the friendly diner feel but with a wider selection of items....great flavor and fresh!"}
{"text":"My son and I were very impressed with the food and the service.  We ordered the Breakfast Changa and the Greek Skillet.  The skillet was loaded with meat and vegetables, and the \"Changa\" was huge.  We took about half of the food home.  The servers stopped by several times to see if we needed anything and were friendly.  Also, we ordered the Rustic dessert changa...excellent.  It was loaded with berries, cream cheese, and whipped cream.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Needed a quick breakfast place close to home so I yelped it! Great service, didn't get the name of the male server but he was very nice. Dad and the husband had the two egg classic with crispy bacon. And it was nice and crispy. Hubs added a pancake and it was huge with a nice crust. I had the Mexican burrito and took half of it home! Didn't care for their salsa though. I told the server it was our first time and we would be back. He said hold on let me get you a loyalty card! There was a line out the door as we were leaving."}
{"text":"We come here often, food is usually good but service is annoyingly slow. Told them our party was in a hurry, but it took almost 15 minutes for them to take our drink order. It took another 20 minutes to get our food, leaving us little time to eat.  Granted they get busy but this is a small place and has 4 wait staff for about 30 tables, no reason for the slow service. Some staff even walk right by you if it isn't their table-very annoying if your trying to get a second cup of coffee.  As I said the food is usually good. The staff are usually pleasant. Prices are a little higher than nearby places. If you want a table quickly call about 10 minutes before your arrival time to be put on the waiting list as they do get busy during the early mornings.  Over all food is good, place is comfortable but allow plenty of time to order & eat."}
{"text":"Wow this place is excellent, the service, the staff is friendly and the food is delicious.  We had the skillet and the chorizo and potatoes were mmm delicious. Is a place that will be on my list to come back.   Good service  Friendly staff Delicious food   Wha else can you ask for right!"}
{"text":"I am sometimes over on this side of town and often see \"Rustic Cafe.\" Turns out, some people in the area recommended it so I finally checked it out.  It was just very \"okay.\"  Nothing special. Had dinner there. The descriptions on the menu make everything sound really good and fresh.  I ordered fish tacos.  Didn't taste too fresh. Fish tasted like it was just thawed from a frozen state.  The pico at the bottom of the taco was so cold that I thought the taco shell was served to me frozen.  Very average. My friends had omelets and they looked good but the toast that came with it was not even decent-looking bread.  If they could cook the items on the menu better, with those descriptions given, they would be okay. Gotta \"up\" the cooking quality."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and food was great, I'm a recurring customer the food and spirit is always great and the pancakes are giant and so good."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often, before i moved away.  I have fond memories of many god breakfasts here.  I was back in the area this morning and was really looking forward to breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. The plate was full of onions and peppers, but that was about it. There appeared to be one egg, scrambled with just a few sliced potatoes and some sliced corned beef. It didn't taste bad, I was just surprised that past the generous helping of peppers and onions there was not much food. Oh well, I guess good things can't last forever."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place out. It was really busy. This was our first time. The food was average and service was good but it took awhile to get our food once we ordered it. I had the rustic burrito- it was ok just plain."}
{"text":"Disorganized chaos.   We like this place and try and go frequently, but the disorganized service is killing it. We will give it a few more times, but notice more than that.   This morning we ended up at a table in no mans land. To our knowledge, we never had a server. After 10 minutes of sitting there we grabbed someone and put in a drink order. 10 minutes after that we grabbed someone else and finally *got* our drinks. Eventually we put in an order, which clearly made a quick run to some nearby city before it made it to the kitchen.   We *almost* got a water refill, which was cool. Almost.   Our meals were also *almost* correct. Only a few items missing we later managed to get removed from the bill.   Everyone was friendly, but they need to take a hard look at how poorly they run the front of house. This isn't the first time we've had an experience like this, and they didn't look all the under staffed.   We had our kids which didn't help since they subsisted in a liquid diet until the food showed up- then didn't eat."}
{"text":"You might as well rename the restaurant Denny's because that is the quality of food you will get here. I was super disappointed in the whole experience. The wait staff was unfriendly and just didn't want to be there. Our sons food came out first and then 20 mins later ours arrived. We ordered simple meals. Scrambled eggs, French toast and hash browns. The scrambled eggs tasted like they came from a box and if you could make oil crunchy, that would describe their hash browns. Although we did have some entertainment while we waited, the table in the center of the restaurant was drawing up their needles and injecting themselves with which I assume was insulin right at the table. Classy place!"}
{"text":"This place is slow and not worth the wait. It took close to 40 mins for scrambled eggs, hash browns, and ham with the place being 20 percent full. The scrambled eggs were browned and the hashbrowns bland. It kind of felt like the kids were making mother's day breakfast. Plus- it was very clean and the waitress friendly but i won't be back!"}
{"text":"We live right up the street and instead of our usual run of the mill breakfast spot, we tried rustic. This place is amazing for families! I usually get the Denver omelette w a pancake and I cannot tell you how much I would love to be able to eat the whole thing, but there's no way-it's huge! Kids meals are $2.99, can't beat it, especially when they aren't finished half of the time! The service is pretty good, could be friendlier but they are always really fast and never make a mistake! We come back here all the time and will continue to!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Rustic Cafe for lunch today.  Looked at the Yelp reviews and on line menu thinking this is a place both my wife and I would enjoy.  Sometimes I'm in the breakfast mood and she's not so things looked promising.    We were seated quickly and received average service overall.  They certainly don't go out of their way to do anything extra.  You even have to butter your own toast (actually not butter but half melted Country Crock).  I got the feeling a great deal of the food is prepackaged.  My wife ordered the salad with smoked salmon.  The lettuce was not fresh and my wife had to pick out the pieces that were super wilted and sticking to the edible leaves.  Looked a lot like that grocery store packaged salad that's been sitting in the fridge a little too long.  The smoked salmon was maybe equal to two strips of lox.  It was torn into a few pieces and rolled up so it would look bigger...which it did compared to what was essentially a side salad.  Very disappointed for $10.    I had the Greek Skillet.  Two eggs over green peppers, \"gyro\" meat, olives, feta, and onions.  Served with side of hash browns and toast.  First, several reviews mention the cold hash browns.  Believe it..they are served barely warm.  They are flavorless as they are simply potatoes without onions or any other flavors.  The Greek Skillet was fair.  The gyro meat is the prefab strips, not nearly as good as many fast food places serve.    No reason to return."}
{"text":"Great quality food and coffee, clean friendly atmosphere, and very reasonable prices...what more can you ask for.  Might be my new favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Great find! Fresh and flavorful cranberry chicken salad and spicy chicken wrap for a good price.  Plenty of good choices for sides with the sandwiches.  I had the macaroni salad, which was very tasty - just the right amount of dressing, too.  Service was friendly and attentive during a late lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast anytime, good prices, local business, super friendly staff, and close to home. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise! Colorful decor. Service was friendly helpful. Well put togeather menu. Lots to chose from. I had a blueberry pancake with strawberries. Pancake was fluffy and fruit fresh. My frind had a BLT homemade macaroni salad and batter dipped onion rings. All the food was yummy. Lookung foward to next visit saw a few items that I want to try"}
{"text":"Like the food..sometimes..but its inconsistent... my family won't go anymore because there is a funny smell in the place."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I had a hamburger and my friend had fish . Didn't care that they pushed their Christian music station on their customers."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Our family of five ordered various menu items to share them all...and each one was very good.  Great service at a great price...+a 5% discount for paying with cash.  We plan to go back."}
{"text":"Quick, quality food and local business for breakfast on a Saturday morning. It's hidden within a strip mall on the corner. At 10am we didn't wait more than 10 minutes and left within 45. Reasonable prices. Lots of options. Portions average.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Now that was nice...  Coffee in a little bistro with table service. You gotta love a hot topped coffee for about three bucks and appreciate what this place is NOT: Denny's or Starbucks. It feels good here.   I did not have any food but the menu looked great and I will be back here for coffee for sure. Tip the server a few bucks for that bottomless cup of coffee, hang out, and read the paper... it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered fish taco's, recommended by waiter... got three taco's with crispy crust, and very little actual fish inside. Neither waiter seemed concerned about my complaint. Won't go back"}
{"text":"My roommate and I absolutely love this place. The only downside is that every time we go, we swear we'll try something new, but inevitably we end up ordering our tried and true items. We'll split the Arizona Burrito for breakfast because it's massive (loaded with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and cheese with sour cream and salsa), or the Rustic Chicken Club if we're there for lunch. Even if we get separate entrees, the bill never comes to more than 20 or 25 bucks including a tip.   No, the atmosphere isn't exactly \"rustic\", but the food is always fresh, the restaurant is clean and well maintained, and the staff has always been friendly. One man who works there in particular (I wish I knew his name) is amazing. For the longest time we thought he was the owner because the service was so above and beyond.  I'm sad they are only open until 3 PM now, but I hope they pick up again soon so we can go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Everything they serve at this restaurant is amazing!  The staff is friendly.  My husband and I stopped by one day, and I forgot my wallet.  I of course was embarrassed, but the waiter Michael was very understanding and made us feel better for being so absent minded.  The next day we went back to pay our bill and ordered another amazing meal.  Michael is a wonderful waiter.  We recommend this restaurant for great atmosphere, food and especially the wait staff."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  What a Gem!!  My wife and I looked for a place to grab breakfast,  after dropping our car for service at a nearby dealer.  We were both pleasantly surprised by everything here!  Service was top notch,  food was outstanding!  And....  We quickly realized that the family values and tradition here run deep within the establishment!  Thank you for an outstanding breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Prices are great!  Food is hit or miss depending on how busy they are.  I usually go for the two egg breakfast but decided to explore their new menu.  I had chicken Marsala with macaroni salad.  I expected to get a pasta dish but it was just chicken with Marsala gravy which by the way was delicious.  The Mac salad was good but I like a creamier version with more mayo.  The house salad was delish with the basic ingredients: tomatoes, cucumber croutons on romaine the balsamic vinaigrette makes it quite yummy."}
{"text":"Support Local... Every visit is fabulous.. My family and I support small business owners and love to frequent this wonderful restaurant. The selection and quality of the food is top notch, well priced and the staff is ALL About Customer Service... Support our local small business owners and try this place, They wont disappoint!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This breakfast joint is great! It's small town home cooking vibe and atmosphere. The wait staff is always hustling and very nice. I love that it's not a chain and always a great place to meet the family and not super crowded with a wait."}
{"text":"great little breakfast place been a couple of times food is never been disappointing great portions for the prices. the only thing I wish that they did have was their liquor license so you could enjoy a mimosa or a Bloody Mary who wouldn't like that on the weekends. great location just north of the 101 either sit on the patio or enjoy the quaint little interior with artwork for sale on the walls."}
{"text":"We rarely go out to eat and this was suppose to be a treat. I ordered Eggs Benedict and my husband had an omelet, with hash browns and toast. everything tasted fine, but, they where both extremely cold. I ate mine anyways; my husband ate the omelet but he couldn't eat the hash browns or toast. We where both very disappointed. Probably won't be going back. It was a waste of money."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Most pathetic excuse for a manager and service is slow and disrespectful. Also, check your food before you eat it. You might find a strand of hair.. or two."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast this morning, fist time at the place, it was just OK, but they definitely have potential. I don't know what happened to the food from stove to table, but it was a little cold, but edible. The toast is brought to you not buttered (big mistake, it should be buttered) I asked for hash browns crispy they were almost crispy, the steak was very good. I hope they read this because I'm hoping they will read and review their steps and hopefully they will make changes or try some changes to correct these issues.  All in all the food was good just needed to be better. The staff and the place was fantastic, I loved being there, I hope to go again and I hope to enjoy it more."}
{"text":"Best, fresh and tasty food in NorPho! We come here nearly every week and I've tried nearly a dozen different options. Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time a few years ago.  Raved about the food.  But now they hire high school kids or younger individuals that only refill your glass once before the bill.  I am disappointed as I informed the owner, via their website about their poor service.  Sadly no reply.  I am disappointed that their owners were not proactive in retaining customers and just moving forward with hiring their kid's friends.  I have always enjoyed the food here but the service sucks.  Who wants to wait 45 minutes for a water refill?  I've given this place a try and try agin as I want to go here as it is very close to my home.  But there is only so much you can do if  management provides sub-par service."}
{"text":"Breakfast at the Rustic Cafe - what a treat! Sweet little place on Cave Creek and the 101, but never noticed it before. Based on the reviews here on Yelp, I had no real expectations so I was completely surprised when we had a most delightful breakfast.   Nice menu with lots of options. Hubby had the Breakfast Changa. He was in Seventh Heaven. This is a huge burrito filled with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and cheese, then fried. I can't believe he ate the whole thing. I ordered the spinach and mushroom omelet and it was just perfect. I am \"Sally\" when it comes to ordering eggs, and I'm difficult to please. I was thrilled when my omelet actually arrived on the soft side and the hash browns came they way I ordered - almost burnt.   Our server was very pleasant, as was the rest of the staff . . . I would have given Rustic Cafe 5 stars except for one thing -- they serve their toast with Country Crock (not real butter). I should probably have asked if they have real butter, just when they brought flavored coffee creamer, I asked for plain and they graciously provided me with it.   We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Rustic cafe on several occasions with my 3 kids. Two of them are the pickiest of eaters you will find ( 11 yrs old )!  My son swears he has never eaten better chicken strips and every time has eaten every last Bite ( Never happens )!  My daughter will go through several bowls of her soup and I am usually lucky to get her to have a 1/2 of anything she orders.  My oldest Loves the Chicken Alfredo.  I usually get one of the Mediterranean dishes or the lox platter which is sooo good!!  I am always recommending this perfect neighborhood establishment .  Now they have an alcohol license I'm coming no kids for Happy Hour!!  They carry Blue Moon beer!!!!!"}
{"text":"Little cafe on the east side of cave creek north of the 101 freeway.  We live nearby & enjoy the homey atmosphere with decent fresh food.  Last time I got the egg white bagel sandwich  ($7.99) on an everything bagel and a cup of fruit ($1.99).  I really enjoyed the avocado, egg white, ham and melted cheese.  My hunny got the green chili burger which he ordered medium but it was well done- of course.  He enjoyed the bread.  Minus 1 point for tchotchke hair ties and homemade baby clothes being displayed at hostess area.  This is not a boutique and I suggest you elevate your dining experience by ditching the dust collectors."}
{"text":"its never a bad idea to come to eat at this place... food and service is always friendly and on point. thank you rustic"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and very nice and friendly staff.. Many gluten free options too. Eggs Benedict and Steak and eggs were great and so were the Chicken and waffles. Call ahead on Sunday though!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service! We will defiantly support this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves my all time favorite biscuits and gravy! Stopped here from yelp reviews on a trip to Phoenix and ended up combing back a second time the food was so good! Service and atmosphere were just icing on the cake. Can't wait for my next trip - mouth watering now."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live really close and are always looking for a good breakfast place. We read the reviews before going and were a little apprehensive about the wait time and service complaints. We went on a Saturday morning around 9:30 and were seated on the patio. No wait. Hostesses were polite, but not as cheerful and receptive as I usually expect from most places after my many years experience as a receptionist and hostess. First and last impression is always important to me. Patio seating was ok. They have rod iron table and chairs (low quality), no cushions... Not exceptional, but not bad. Coffees were great! Food was delicious and exactly what I expected and portions were medium. Our server was a little too relaxed for my taste and forgetful for a simple order at a time when it was not too busy. To give them a five star rating I would be looking for more efficient and well trained servers and more comfortable outside seating. Overall service was good and we will go again."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to this place (first time was lunch) and I was very pleased. I tried the corned beef and eggs per a recommendation on Yelp. It was not like any corned beef hash I have ever had. It was kinda like breakfast fajitas without the tortillas, super good! I am surprised this place isn't busier. They have a huge breakfast menu with all kinds of options, and their lunch is great too. Definitely check this local gem out!"}
{"text":"Tom: I love this place.  They are quick and offer quite a fun selection of different foods.  You are in and out and for a \"cafe\" type it works perfectly.  I like the Ham n Swiss sandwich.  The bacon at this place is second to none.  They do it PERFECTLY.  Also, the Gyro I've gotten on a few occasions and enjoy it a lot.  I do want to try it for dinner with the prime rib/potatoes.  It is a very clean restaurant.  The one thing that doesn't work is that it is oddly decorated.  What is with the rainbow tiles on the wall?  Also, lose the TV.    Ann: Very enjoyable restaurant.  We have become regulars here usually for breakfast or lunch and have never had a bad experience.  The wait staff is friendly and accommodating to requests.  Omelets are excellent as well as a variety of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Rustic Cafe is a cute, little diner with great food. I would recommend it to anyone in the area. I ordered a plate of pancakes and they were nicely crispy on the outside while being fluffy inside. The coffee was okay, not fabulous, but on par for a diner. I don't think they're open past 3:00, so make sure to go earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Very little to no vegan options (only oatmeal or toast with ala carte side items) (no soy milk or alternative milk for coffee either). They struggle with consistency. If you go there on a weekday morning you'll get great service. Go there on a weekend morning (especially Sunday) you'll get complete chaos. I am not vegan but I prefer to eat without animal products. I got an egg sandwich there one day and it was great (large and very flavorful). Went back on a Sunday morning and the experience was not the same. They couldn't figure out how do deal with a party of 8 so finally they put us outside where there was a fly infestation that was really annoying. My avocado and tomato was served on a large piece of visibly and extremely dirty lettuce that had not been rinsed. They put whipped cream all over regular waffles and kid's pancakes so beware if you don't like whipped cream. My sister hated her breakfast veggie enchiladas. My grandma hated her whipped cream waffle. The kid's food had poor presentation so the children didn't want to eat it with the whipped cream on it. My sister bought one of the cute dresses at the front and they ran her card for someone else's meal then they had to refund it. My mom loved her pancake which was gigantic. My dad loved his eggs benedict. Their menu is very large but they need to add some things that are vegan friendly (soy milk, tofu, bananas that can be put in the oatmeal, etc.). They have 25 omelets and scramble options - I should have the option to substitute tofu instead of egg. The bus boy opened up the bill on the table next door and yelled out, \"WHAT!?\" really loud. My parents love this place and go there all the time and now my sister hates it with a passion. I am in the middle of the road but that lettuce made me mad and made me feel nauseous."}
{"text":"If you drive by too fast, you'll miss it.  My husband googled places near where we live to eat as we were going to the movies with my sister (I'm the sister in the review below!) We decided to forego the chains and stick to a local biz. I'm glad we did. I had a burger and steak fries and it was all very good. Our server was chatty and nice and we had a very pleasant experience. We put it on our lists of local spots! Tasty."}
{"text":"Food was great! A cute small place and I loved the atmosphere! Had the grilled cheese (which was delicious), bacon, and the fruit cup which was perfectly fresh fruit. Perfect for a Sunday morning breakfast or brunch. I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"I never really understood the appeal and pervasiveness of the \"Friday night fish fry\".  Thanks to Wikipedia I now know that they began as a response to Catholic restrictions on eating meat on Fridays.  But outside of religious reasons I can't see why someone would get excited over something you can get anytime at Long John Silvers or your favorite fish & chips joint.  So, when I came here super-hungry on a Friday night, the main reason spurring me to order the fish was the promise of it being \"all-you-can-eat\".  I was taken aback when the 1st plate came out at how big, golden and crunchy the fish was.  I'm really picky about how fish is prepared, and this was perfect.  The sides were good, too, everything tasted fresh and the portions were big.  After my first plate I was getting pretty full, and wondered if I should have ordered the normal fried fish plate, but it tasted so good I couldn't stop!  I think I had 2 more plates...  Everything about the visit was great.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere was bright yet cozy.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  The prices are very reasonable.  I'll definitely have to come back.  NOTE:  The hours they have posted on their website seem to be outdated, but I think the ones shown on the menu are accurate."}
{"text":"First time not to impressed, my wife had the eggs Benedict she enjoyed them. We shared a pancake it waste too fluffy for my taste. I prefer thinner cakes, kind of bland.  Had eggs & ham with home fried potatoes.   The ham was thick very nice peace of meat. However it was not warm in the center also the potatoes were under cooked. Good taste but under cooed. Had a English muffin also that was way under toasted.  We were there at the end of the breakfast rush, we will try a earlier time on are next visit."}
{"text":"nice place for breakfast, like service even they was busy, didn't feel  that, food was testy usual choices for breakfast but cook well"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Chicken mushroom soup with beef on a weck with coleslaw. Everything was quite good and well presented. It has been years since I have had a beef on weck (in Buffalo) and this one brought back good memories. This restaurant will probably become a regular stop!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  That about sums it up.  It wasn't fabulous or bad...I'll definitely be back.  I got the eggs au gratin.  they were pretty good.  I'd prob ask for more parmesan cheese next time.  The hashbrowns weren't all that great, a little starchy for my liking.  The service was super, the place was clean.  I don't have any complaints"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times mostly out of convenience. The staff is very polite, the wait on food is hit and miss (sometimes way to long sometimes average) and the food is just okay. So far nothing has been above average at all and the rustic potato (hash brown) actually isn't good at all. Simple food and friendly staff ... If I could give 2.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Generally we have found this place to have pretty bland food except for an amazing california style egg sandwich with egg, tomato, avocado, spinach, cheese and an amazing chipotle aioli on sourdough grilled bread. It is just amazing! Their service is also very bad. We rarely see the server to get a refill of coffee before the food is delivered. Despite all the negatives with their service and mostly bland food, the egg sandwich kept us coming back for more. Today I think that will stop because they messed up our beloved egg sandwich by forgetting the chipotle aioli (which leaves a very dry, bland sandwich) and then it took 10 minutes to get the servers attention to ask for the aioli on the side to make the sandwich edible. What is really sad is that it wasn't even us that got his attention. A very nice ex-marine grabbed our server and pointed out that we had been trying for 10 minutes to get his attention.   There are a few stand out items on their large menu, but the horrible service and blandness of the rest of the menu makes it easy to give a 2 star review."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast there this morning and it was a mixed bag hence the 3 star review. I had the Southwestern hash and she had the country fried steak and eggs. Mine was decent, but somewhat under seasoned and the toast was burnt. Her steak was very good, but the eggs were slightly less than the over medium ordered and the hash browns were stiff and not good.   Service was overall decent. Slow at times but friendly."}
{"text":"You gotta love private owned diggs! If you like mediterranean food try the shwarma! If you are looking for an inexpensive breakfast, they start at $3.99! Go and enjoy...."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed breakfast  at this restaurant.  It was a short 5 minute wait during a busy Sunday morning.  We were served right away with our drink request.  We looked around to see that the pancakes are bigger than the plate.  We both ordered two different types of Benedicts, which we enjoyed.  The good was good as well as the service.  I gives the feel of a small town family restaurant.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Food was good but my issue is this... I eat brunch alone. Three servers passed me by while I waited to be seated. Finally- one asked me if I was here to pick up an order. No. I'd like to eat. By yourself? Yes. By myself. I got seated and felt much of the same awkwardness from my server. Does eating alone equal less service? I hope not. There's nothing wrong with brunch alone!"}
{"text":"We randomly stopped here for breakfast one morning and didn't realize how good I would be! Their breakfast burrito and pancake were great. A lot of food for your money. The atmosphere is kind of small and cramped but very minor compared to the quality of the food. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood friendly. Fresh and clean, why isn't it busier? I believe it's missing that,  \"unique\" edge. It's a safe place to visit but I'm not needing to return to enjoy what I had or to try something new. Great location and a nice place to meet a friend for a simple meal."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, it's a nice cute restaurant and I love going there frequently , 10/10 would recommend you go there; it's the best breakfast/lunch spot"}
{"text":"Wow what a cool \"rustic\" place! very cute and cool at the same time! We found it in our entertainment book and we live right by the place! We were looking for a cheap cool place by our house.  The service was good and the food was yummy! I had Eggs Benedict and my wife had a Gyro. Both were cooked very well and I asked for a lil extra Bearnaise sauce and it was on the plate not in a lil cup like some places! The eggs were a lil overdone but still delicious and the wife's Gyro was very flavorful. The prices were very reasonable even without the 20% off coupon we had.  All in all we will be back and if you are in the area and hungry for some good food I say swing in and give it a try. Let me know what you think..."}
{"text":"We take my elderly mother there for a meal whenever we come to town to visit.  She loves the food.  The prices are good, the food is delicious, the staff very prompt and helpful.  We love that the ingredients are fresh and the portions are large."}
{"text":"This was actually our second time here. The first time was a week day in the afternoon. We had gone in and waited to be seated, but no one ever came out to acknowledge we were there. We finally left.  We decided to give them another try. This time on a Sunday when we figured they would have more staff. We got there a little past noon. There was a young lady by the door when we entered. She asked how many and led us to a table for four with two chairs. She placed the menus on the table then turned and walked away. Not a word spoken other than the cursory 'how many'.   Our server came by and we asked if she could wipe off our table. It wasn't dirty from food, but there were little bits of something white. She came back with a rag and wiped what was on the table in my friend's direction. When he asked her not to do that, because it was going in his lap, she said she would get our server and disappeared. Okay, so far, not off to a good start.  Our new server came by and took our drink order. The menu is fairly extensive, offering a selection of breakfast entrees, wraps, salads, burgers and even pizza. I decided on the Mediterranean Meat Salad minus the pita wedges and dressing on the side. My friend ordered the Porky Pig Burger with a side salad.  While we were waiting for our food, I was looking around at things. There are two dining rooms. A main one and a smaller secondary one. We were in the smaller one. First, there isn't anything rustic about the decor. The only thing that stands out are several large displays of hair bows and dresses. They are just inside the door when you enter. It looks like items better suited for a craft fair and very out of place. Where we were sitting, the paint on the wall was peeling and it looked like a drink had spilled down the wall. The floor was also dirty. Maybe because we were near the patio, but it was a big turn off. And it was loud. There was nothing to buffer the sound.  The food came out after fifteen minutes. The burger was a bit overcooked, but still very good. It came with three thick cut slices of bacon, a slice of ham and all the fixings. The Gyro Meat salad looked great and was fresh. A nice mix of romaine and other greens along with cucumber, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, gyro meat, lemon juice and tzatzikii sauce. The tzatziki sauce was lacking in flavor. I 've had better. Feta cheese would have also added a nice 'pop' to the salad.  I would give this place 2 stars based on atmosphere and service. The food a 3. For now, I'll go with 3 and will maybe give it another try at some point."}
{"text":"Decided to try Rustic Cafe for breakfast.  The decor of the cafe was very nice.  The staff was very welcoming and accommodating.  The wait staff helped us with our orders.  I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, hash-browns, and raisin toast.    The food arrived hot.    Unfortunately, the eggs were not scrambled.  I'm finding that some restaurants are not scrambling the eggs but just cooking them like they are prepping an omelet, leaving them flat and not fluffy.  Such is the case with Rustic Cafe.  The eggs were rubbery and near dry.   Bacon and hash browns were good.  Raisin toast was overly dry.  Served with Country Crock margarine.  Not to my liking.  Ended up eating maybe half the dish.  My wife order a breakfast burrito and found the eggs to be in the same condition.  She ate less than half of her breakfast.  Don't know if they used real eggs or eggs in a carton but The Rustic Cafe has potential.  Just needs lessons on how to cook good eggs.  Let the wait staff know of our dissatisfaction but no accommodations were made.    Will not return."}
{"text":"I first visited this place when they opened a few years ago and then again recently I have to say the quality of the food and the menu have both gotten better and many of the dishes are very very good.  Also recommend you try the salsa but the chef makes homemade got a kick to it but it's absolutely great so good in fact my wife and I bought some to take home.  I would've given a five star rating but we waited 45 minutes before we were able to order so be prepared for average at best service with good food."}
{"text":"The Hubs and I gave this small neighborhood joint a try this past weekend for breakfast.  Though we have driven past here many times, since it is near our house, we've never stopped in.  We decided to give it a try for breakfast on Sunday afternoon.  Upon our arrival, we were promptly greeted and told we could sit anywhere.  We choose a table by the window and thoroughly liked the light, airy feeling inside.  The menu is pretty large with lots to choose from.  After much deliberation, I decided to get the corn beef hash and the Hubs got eggs Benedict.  It took about 20-30 minutes to get our food, which was kind of a long time for eggs, but once it came, everything was warm and how we ordered it.  I found the corn beef to be OK, nothing great... more peppers and onions then corned beef.  I really liked the eggs Benedict my Husband ordered.  His hash browns were also good... could have used some salt and pepper and maybe onion, but they were crisp and cooked well.  Everything we had was good, not great... we weren't blow away, but we were satisfied.  All in all, this is a good spot for breakfast.  I am sure we will return in the future when we are in the mood for a good fresh meal."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent but yelp said they had Bloody Mary but they don't. Ugh. But food was really good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch and it was great!  We were greeted with a friendly young man who took us right to a table. Everyone there was super nice and helpful. I ordered the BLT,  which the bacon was perfect,  the fries were crispy. Although the coleslaw was a tad on the sweet side,  it was still really good.  A u cute,  pretty quiet, little place- I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this morning and we waited about 30-40 mins for food (mind you there was only two of us with simple orders), we used to come here often with family until the service went down hill, first time back in months sad to see nothing has improved. Also only got one coffee refill. Not our first time here but it will be our last, food was not amazing enough to make up for bad service."}
{"text":"My go to spot for great AM grub.  Service is great, has real chill vibe, and price is right. They have an assortment of cafe drinks to start your day off right. Biscuits n Gravy for around $3 is what i recommend.  Nice patio area to enjoy awesome early morning phx skies.  Oh and has free wifi :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere and good service. Just a good place to go when you are looking for someplace to hang out and talk."}
{"text":"Zero stars is more appropriate.  Overlooked greasy food and coffee worse than Starbucks"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning with my daughter since I had to drop off my car for an oil change.    I had about an hour to kill and it took about 40 minutes to get our food.  The service was friendly but painfully slow.  It shouldn't take that long for eggs, potatoes and a couple slices of bacon.  There was no apology for the delay and the table being served in front of us that happened to be seated at the same time ordered their food AND finished before we got any of our food.    Rustic Cafe is really lacking attention to detail, there was peeling, bubbling paint on the wall, really old dirty looking ketchup bottles with worn labels and dirty lids (not very appetizing), you had to butter your own cold toast.  I don't think that we will be back..prices are fair but I rather pay a few extra dollars for a better overall experience."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time there. The first time, the food was pretty good but the service was poor. Waited a while to even order and I never had my water refilled. The check was dropped off when he delivered my food. I used to be a server for many years. So I know what it's like to be in the industry. I left a decent tip anyway.   Today I again waited to order. First I ordered my drink and the server came back almost 10 minutes later with it and said \"sorry, I blanked you out\". Then he took my order and I ordered my fries on the side. When my food came, he forgot to put my fries on the side. After he brought me a small plate, I never saw him again until he came to pick up my credit card. He had left my check while I was at the rest room. I had to ask someone else for a drink refill.  My highlight to the visit was one of the servers running around with his underwear showing. Like he was being one of those street kids. I let the owner know and he said something to him. He came back out with his pants hiked up. 5 minutes later they fell down again with his underwear once again showing. Very unprofessional and inappropriate. There is a place and time for everything. Serving in a restaurant is not the place nor the time.   A shame. I don't think I will come back again. All because of the lack of service. The front of the house is just as important as the back. I wish them much luck because they need it.  I gave them two stars for the food."}
{"text":"The food is always great. The service is always extremely disappointing. I've tried this place 3 times now. Each time I have waited at the front for at least 5 minutes before anyone noticed me (two times busy and one time not), had unfriendly waitresses and just a total lack of service all the way around. I will not make it a 4th trip for sure. Maybe takeout but never dining in again. Too bad too because it really does have a great menu and the food is always on par."}
{"text":"Was running behind today, so I stopped in and ordered to go. Got two orders of French toast with real blueberries. This was a total hit! I was dropping a friend off at work, so while I drove she enjoyed the french toast and blue berries. First the smell was amazing. They used real blueberries, not glazed. And the french toast was warm and soft but not overly eggy.  Excellent breakfast. The gentleman at the counter also made a special coffee for me. Easy enough, cocoa and maple syrup at the bottom, coffee on top. Helps with hormonal imbalances, i really appreciated him making it though. He used hot chocolate mix and the syrup, which made just the right blend of bitter and sweet. Will be coming back, next time I get to pass through Cave Creek.   Also, the handmade items at the front are so cute! We enjoyed touching and shopping while waiting for our food."}
{"text":"Huge portions! Fresh food. Great service! Very creative dishes and by far the best place to eat in our neighborhood.   What can I say, I'm a super fan!"}
{"text":"Well, we have been here 3 or 4 times now and unfortunately each time, the food quality seems to slip a little more.   Our last visit was a weekday around 8:30a - the place was pretty much empty so we were seated quickly, however the table top was in need of some repair and overall TLC. No biggie, but strange since there were so many other \"good\" tables to seat us.  Anyway, service was quick yet, the food lack in overall flavor. My wife had a country breakfast which looked good but, sorely needed salt, pepper, or anything to kick up the flavor - gravy was bland, biscuits large but no buttery flavor you would like to have, eggs were the same and hash browns crispy but that was about it.   I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over easy - eggs were okay but very small, my english muffin was warm but definitely not toasted and the \"hash\" was slices of corned beef with peppers and onions - peppers & onions were great, corned beef was bland.  It's a shame, our first visit last year was great but, slowly this place seems to have lost its mojo. May be that's why its empty on a weekday for breakfast. Bummer - we really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"OK, went back and gave it another try. Service still pretty slow, but much, much better than last time. Breakfast still a bargain and their kids' meals are great."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some breakfast for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  The place wasn't packed at all.  The nice thing was there's a patio area in case you wanted to eat outside, but I saw some smokers out there and decided to decline.  Does AZ have any laws regarding smoking in restaurant patios?    I tried their southwestern omelet and it was good.  The salsa and chorizo weren't too overwhelming with spices.  The hash browns were crispy but not burnt.  The plate was a good portion to start the day off.  This place beats going to a Denny's or some chain."}
{"text":"mom and i were looking for a quick bite to eat after leaving dad's VA memorial service at national cemetery.  read some great reviews for rustic cafe and decided to give it a try.  we picked a winner!  we both ordered the southwestern omelette with spicy chorizo, grilled red peppers and melted jack cheese on top. plus they had a real nice salsa.  nice and clean environment with very kind service!  definitely will be a stop for us in the future--just wish they were closer to us!"}
{"text":"Its alright food, but its pricey for what they make, and it's not even that expensive. Sauce is probably the easiest and cheapest thing to make and they are incredibly stingy with it. Also, The Gyro I ordered looked the meat was frozen processed meat. Not shredded in the gyro but is patty form. . . IDK about this place."}
{"text":"I have a very mixed review for this restaurant.  I have been there twice; the first time was fabulous and the second time was a nightmare.  Let me explain. The first time we had a very good, although very young, waitress.  My husband and I both ordered hamburgers and they were excellent.  I ordered the patty melt and the hamburger tasted and looked homemade and fresh.  On our second visit we again had a very young waitress, although this time she was terrible.  (We asked for a to go bag or box for our pita chips and she brought us a piece of tinfoil. Just one of many examples.)  This time we decided to share the mushroom and swiss burger because our previous burgers were so good.  What a difference! This second burger was definitely a preformed patty with a very strange texture and flavor.  We brought this to the attention of the waitress (we actually tried to grab a different waitress thinking she might be of more help); she informed us that she mentioned it to the cook and he said they always get their meat from the same place and it wasn't any different.  Believe me, it was different!!!! The first visit to the restaurant elicited many recommendations from us.  This time, we feel we need to withdraw all those recommendations.  Because the first burger was so good we are going to give the place another try; however, you can be certain that we will NOT try the burger!"}
{"text":"I enjoy having breakfast at the Rustic Cafe at least once a week. Sometimes I eat with friends, other times alone. It's a small quaint place that is a well kept secret. I believe it is family owned and operated, so you get that \"eating at mom's house\" kind of vibe. The menu is extensive and the prices are very reasonable. Take the time to visit this spot and see for yourself."}
{"text":"We ordered our food via postmates and are glad we did! The food was great with a nice blend of flavors. We both got the California breakfast sandwich. They were very accommodating to an allergy request and a substitution for a bagel instead of bread. Highly recommend getting extra chipotle aioli on the side!"}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood spot. The wait staff, food, and patio are what keep drawing us back."}
{"text":"This place has very good food and decent prices. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict and added grilled ham. Instead of hash browns I ordered a side of tomatoes to put on the Benedict and it was delightful. Not every restaurant does a good job with hollandaise sauce, but there's was pretty good. My mom ordered the classic breakfast sandwich and husband ordered the classic breakfast, both of them liked their food.   I gave 4/5 stars due to the service being disorganized and slow. With that being said, the food and prices were good enough to go back. They may have just had an off day with service. On a positive note, everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"My omlete was perfect, the coffee was hot,  and the service was great.  It is a far drive from Peoria,  but I will definitely be coming back,  thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, like the wooden tables and chairs.  Not really a \"rustic\" setting, more bright and comfortable with lots of natural light and colored ceramic tiles on the walls.  Big breakfast menu and it's served all day.  Think the owner is in the kitchen, which is usually a good sign.  Pizza is good it's all made using pita bread.  good sized portions, good food, friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The service is fast and the prices are cheap. The staff is super nice and always gets your order correct. This is a quality, family-owned restaurant. Once you eat here, you will come back everyday:)"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at Rustic Cafe today.  Prompt, friendly service and excellent food!  Loved the Rustic style Ham & Swiss. Nice to have a cool place close by to relax and eat.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm now a fan. I really like this spot with it's good, fresh food, and FREE WIFI! I've been to so many other competitors and this is what brings me back again and again.  Good (/great) Food Good Price Friendly Staff Free WiFi and not being rushed ...Well done"}
{"text":"I Have eaten at the rustic café many times. It is consistently very good. I have never had a meal that I had to send back to the kitchen. They are always adding items to the menu to keep it interesting and tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going here for our Sunday breakfast. Service is almost always perfect (they get a little overwhelmed when busy), and our orders are always accurate. For the past 15 years, my husband went to the same \"diner\" every Sunday, but when they suddenly closed down, we found Rustic Cafe, and now consider it our Sunday breakfast place. Keep up the good service, food, and prices, and you have yourselves two regulars for life!"}
{"text":"My VP made me squint. Like, you've got to be kidding me-a vendor breakfast meeting at 7 am?  I'm used to the obligatory lunches and dinners but the mornings are usually my time for my devotional, readings, exercise, Yelp, on-line classes, etc. Really wasn't looking forward to being \"on\" for a vendor conversation. Oh well, the rent has to be paid.  Luckily, my VP chose the Rustic Café which made the morning a whole lot brighter.  As a side note, we get there and the rep proceeds to tell us he was fired from the company the day before.  I didn't know whether to laugh or commiserate with him.  Turns out it was a good thing and he was already moving on but staying in the same field so the time wasn't wasted.  Still made for an interesting morning.  Ok, Rustic Café.  I've ridden by here a number of times and had heard good things about it and they were all true.  I wasn't the only person \"on\" that morning.  Our server was completely on, on top of his game.  Probably the only thing better than his service was our food.  Many mornings I'll need a small snack to get me to lunch time.  Not this day.  Huge, delicious, hot portions of hashbrowns, gravy, English muffins.  I had the chicken fried chicken and while it wasn't as good as the gold standards in Texas, it was very good for AZ.  My dining companions had an assortment of pancakes, omelets, bacon, ham, and so on.  We were all impressed with the quality and quantity of food-very generous portions.  The P(rincess) and I try to do brunch on the weekends and the Rustic Café has made the list to take her too, I recommend putting it on your list as well!"}
{"text":"I've driven by the Rustic Cafe everyday and decided to give it a try for the first time today.  Saddly enough it will probably be my last.  My husband and I are pretty easy to please when it comes to breakfast: good service, good food, and a reasonably priced menu with a good selection to choose from.  One out of three for Rustic Cafe. (The menu is big and prices are fair)  Seeing as today was a Sunday and I would assume pretty popular for breakfast we weren't surprised to see the place busy when we got there.  The hostess however was visibly frazzled by the large group that walked in before us and how busy the restaurant was.  We sat at a table for two, in what I assume was the \"bar\".  Unfortunately no one came over to greet us or take our drink order so the hostess came over to do so.  After we waited a few more minutes, still no waitress.  Finally after sitting for a while someone came to our table explaining that while they weren't our server they would take our order.  Our food was then delivered by our actual waitress.  The food was fair, but my husbands omelet was pretty greasy and left something to be desired.  While our waitress was pleasant enough we asked for a few things while eating and she never returned with them.  We sat around after we finished our meal and waited for our bill but again our waitress was nowhere to be found.  The hostess that originally helped us was finally the one who took care of it for us.  We usually like to support local businesses but in order for us to return to the Rustic Cafe there need to be some serious changes made."}
{"text":"The Rustic Cafe has very good food.  It is a nice little locally owned restaurant.   My only complaint would be the service.  My husband and i have been here a few times and the service has not been up to par.  I went with my kids on a SUnday morning for breakfast and the waitress was wearing a shirt that showed her navel.  My suggestion for the owner is to have some type of uniform, even if it is black pants or khaki pants and provide a logo shirt.  Also, have the staff trained on cusotmer service."}
{"text":"I took my wife to the cafe on a Sunday two weeks ago. We had a wonderful breakfast. I had biscuits and gravy. I just wanted just one biscuit so the waiter suggested a half order. Perfectly filling and fresh. Hash browns were good.  My wife ordered an omelet, that she said was very good. I enjoy breakfast out and have eaten at many places over the years. This was definitely a good one.  We will return.  Waiter was very good, the hostess was not a friendly person. I do not want to imply that she was mean but not warm or friendly. For that , I gave it 4 out of 5, and the lobby area was cluttered with inexpensive clothing and homemade items.  At first, it did not seem like a restaurant, more like a kiosk at mall."}
{"text":"It was good- but not great.  We were the only ones seated on our side of the restaurant (I'm guessing because we had a baby with us).  Because of our location we felt a little neglected.  The food was good, but the floor was a huge mess- even before our kid contributed with his dropped toast and crumbs.  We'll probably go back and see if we have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"My daughters and I came in her on a whim when we were on a quick break from their theater rehearsals, only 30 minutes. (We had planned to go to Culver's but it was packed) So needless to see we were in a bit of a rush to get a bite to eat. Right when we walked in the young gentleman greeted us and let us know it would be just a few minutes while they cleaned a table for us. I had told my girls to take a look at the menu so we could order as soon as we sat down, he quickly offered us more menus so we wouldn't have to share one. I thanked him and explained our situation. When he sat us he asked me if we were ready to order and I said yes, he made sure to go get the server for us so we could order right away. Which I greatly appreciated him doing without even being asked.  The server came immediately and was very polite and attentive. When I realized we definitely weren't going to have time to eat there, I asked him if we could get it to go. He said, \"Of course, no problem at all!\" He brought us cups and straws for our drinks & had our food packed and ready to go within minutes, with silverware and everything we needed to eat it on the go.  I greatly appreciated them taking the initiative to truly take care of us and ensuring all of our needs were not only met but exceeded.  Thank you both for being so great. :)  Definitely recommend this quaint little place! The staff alone is worth the visit and it definitely doesn't hurt the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in and the first thing I noticed was the excellent customer service. Ryan greeted me, gave me suggestions, brought me water even though I didn't ask and was all around pleasant. He suggested the Rustic Chicken Club and it was awesome! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Entered at 12:10 and were promptly seated (small dining area seats 46). Waiter arrived, welcomed and asked for drinks. Ordered Ice Tea.  Told him we were not ready to order yet. Came back shortly and we ordered 2 egg breakfast with hash browns and toast (price now $5.99) no sides included. Ordered a side of ham (all meat sides now up to $1.99). Now breakfast is up to $8.00. Also ordered Patty melt with fries $10.00. Took over 25 mins to arrive and the restaurant was only half full. Eggs came on the plate (no bowl for poached eggs), had to ask for a bowl twice. By then eggs were cold.  Plate had so much green leafy stuff I thought I was eating a salad. Hash browns came in 3 parts. 1/3 fried, 1/3 not fried and 1/3 over fried. Patty melt was over cooked and dry. The only good thing was we had a Local Flavor coupon that cost us $11.00 and we got $30.00 worth of \"food\". Too many items on the menu. They need to concentrate on having less of a choice and doing more things right. $2.40 for all drinks is a little much. Short order cook needs to go back to being a set up sous chef and learn how to cook things right. To many restaurants in the Valley to return to this one again. Want a good traditional breakfast go to First Watch."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast this morning thanks to a Groupon deal my mom had laying around that was about to expire. The place was busy but we were seated within a few minutes. While waiting we looked at some of the handmade dresses and hair accessories they are selling. They also have a bunch of wooden signs and mirrors throughout they are selling.  They have a large menu with someone for everyone for both breakfast and lunch (they close at 3:00). We started out with juice and coffee and when the waitress spilled a little of my fathers oj when setting it on the table rather than apologize she simply said she would get him a napkin implying he would be cleaning it up himself which is fine. Several minutes went by and no napkin so he used the one wrapped around his utensils and when she refilled the coffee he asked for another one since that one was soaked. They food showed up 5 minutes later and there was still no napkin so he asked again and we finally got a couple a few minutes later but by then the table was sticky.  The food itself was good. I had a ham and cheese omelette with toast and hash browns. It was all good but the hash browns needed another minute or two to brown up. Mine were bit on the soggy side. My husband had the banana walnut pancakes which were as big as the plate. He only finished half of them. My dad had the corned beef hash which came with toast.   Breakfast for the 3 of us ran about $40.00, not including tip."}
{"text":"I can't believe I was finally able to find an actual breakfast spot in the Phoenix area, I am from just outside of Detroit Michigan where there are these magical places called  \"Coney Islands\" and they are wonderful breakfast spots that people gather at in the morning to read the paper and get some affordable eggs and coffee.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this little place and really enjoyed my breakfast.  I do encourage more newspapers either for sale or available to be read only in the cafe.  Everyone should go and check this place out the servers were great and the management seemed to truly care about creating a good experience for me and my family while I was there.  Being personal and knowing faces and names are the key to places like this."}
{"text":"I have been here three times for breakfast and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it each time. They have extended their menu since the last time I was there, and seem to serve a little bit of everything, with an emphasis on comfort foods. I am a huge fan of biscuits and gravy, and each time I have gone there we have split an order and I havent been disappointed yet. Once I had a southwestern skillet breakfast that was heavy on the cheese, but really tasty. This last time I had the california benedict, with spinach and avocado that really hit the spot. My man had  some kind of breakfast sandwich on texas toast that looked fantastic. The only thing we can't figure out about this place is why it isnt more enticing to us. The food is good, its close to our house, yet we only go when I find a groupon. Maybe its the cafeteria feel of the place? It kinda reminds me of a hospital cafe. Clean and good but not a very happy place. I dont know why, that is just how it strikes me i guess. But I do recommend their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great place for a homestyle big breakfast. No reservations, but you get seated quickly. Everything on the menu is great and cooked from scratch. Reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen."}
{"text":"I am always so surprised when I order off the menu! The food is fresh and so tasty and the chicken hash is one of my favorites. This little place is often crowded and the wait staff is busy, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes. They do a great job."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch food. The closest thing to a small town diner in Phoenix. The staff is always super friendly. One of the best BLT I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Checking out the other reviewers makes me think I am missing something. Twice, I've tried the salmon salad and am not keen about it. Is it simply smoked salad with ranch dressing? Really am interested in 2 cups of additional greens for the $. This salad certainly does not compete with a Wildflower or Paradise Bakery effort.  However, I will try a different dish next time..."}
{"text":"Food was decent, portions ample. Nothing I would crave but nothing I would avoid either. Service was minimal but that's because I was only one outside during a busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"This is a great Sunday morning brunch place.  I like the Chorizo it is surprisingly good.  (I am a big Chorizo fan) Coffee is good too - they have it to go if you are in a hurry Staff are friendly and understanding of crazy kids"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time!  Ordered the Double Decker sandwich... Omg!!!  One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Service was great!  Place is clean!  Would have given 5 stars, but they were out of sweet potato fries and the onion rings aren't homemade."}
{"text":"The two stars were for the friendly staff and cleanliness of the place. Outside of that, there should be no stars for the food or service at all. I'm not sure if our waitress forgot about us and when she went in the back she found our food on the counter getting cold or if they're just slow here, but we've been here several times and each time the service continually gets worse. Cap'n Crunch, Cheerios, sliced fruit, all things that you enjoy eating cold. Belgian waffles and scrambled eggs with bacon, not so much! I don't care where you are, 42 minutes from the time you place your order to the time you receive it is too long!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered country fried steak w over medium eggs and hash browns.   The hash browns are not even cooked they are mostly white not crispy at all.  My eggs are over easy ..gross..the white part is runny. The steak is over cooked and the breading is almost burnt.   Not good and for almost 10 dollars if rather go to filbertos and get a chorizo burrito."}
{"text":"When this place opened it was great. Slowly the food quality became average, the service unpredictable, but the biggest problem was the random karaoke and people playing music at 6:00 pm and is so loud you can't talk to your family.  One night we went and half the restaurant was closed off for some multi level marketing event at prime dinner time, and all the crap they sell at the front door just makes the place look cheap.  We used to go once a month when it opened, but no longer feel it is worth our money."}
{"text":"If you like Fox News, news used loosely, you'll like this place if you don't care about, over priced bad food or service. Ordered a skillet breakfast came on two plates. That's not a skillet. Would not recommend this place and don't plan on going back.Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. The employees were super nice and totally sweet when it took us forever to decide. My sister in law got a pancake breakfast and I got the biscuits and gravy. It was all pretty good. It's kinda standard diner fair. The gravey was a little different than I'm used to, good but different. The sausage was yummy and the eggs were cooked right. My sister in laws pancakes were HUGE  it was in a mid price range."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the staff was overall friendly however I ordered the $12 steak and eggs and I am not kidding they brought out a gigantic black burned hamburger patty..... I didn't even understand what was going on I was so confused and the hashbrowns were absolutely bland it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten however my buddy I was with had eggs Benedict and it was OK except for the hash-browns.  Steak=Burnt Hamburger Patty. ?"}
{"text":"We come here regularly when visiting our daughter in this part of town.  The food is great and the service is excellent!  The folks here are always friendly and make us feel welcome. The prices are reasonable and my wife loves looking at all the items for sale while we are waiting for our table. Overall, an excellent little cafe."}
{"text":"ATTENTION OWNER Not sure why when you place an order ahead of time wait 20 minutes for it at the Restaurant then is brought to the front and the host sees it looks at the ticket and then takes the waiting people to their seat before giving the to go order. It doesn't make any logical sense the order of operations here has been like this for months and I have to voice it now!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday after the rush for a late brunch. The food was unique and fresh, not greasy at all. I totally recommend it. It was quiet/not busy when we came in and our food came out as fast as expected. Wonderful place"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Good food. Large portions. Cute place."}
{"text":"I have had the take out (fish tacos), it was delicious.  I definitely will be dinning in and sampling more of what they have to offer.  I would like to say to the negative reviewers, GET A LIFE!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to go with my girlfriends. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now, so this was the perfect occasion . Their menu is quite large, so options for everyone (vegetarian,  diet friendly). We all got something different and no one was disappointed. I had the County Hash and it was enough for 2. All my friends said we have to make this a regular on our list of places to meet. Friendly staff who took great care of us and all our requests. I will absolutely  be back!"}
{"text":"Not Rustic one bit but sort of Basement Chic.  Family owned featuring The Home Cook preparation Style of breakfast, lunch and dinners in a wide assortment of diner priced meals.  I noticed while dining at lunch time that most people were having breakfast plates and the few who weren't where having GIANT sized burritos and almost everyone leaving were carrying out doggy boxes for latter .  I decided on a Spicy Chicken Wrap and got to pick one of 12 sides I picked Grilled Vegetables.   Well it wasn't too salty or oily and the chicken seemed fresh and being an overly generous portion that could feed two ladies I think I should give 3 stars but, My Spicy Chicken Wrap was NOT SPICY one bit and when I took a bite out of it a big slice of tomato plopped out and the 1/2 wrap I was holding started squirting out liquid all over the plate like it was peeing. My side of grilled vegetables were peppers onions mushrooms zucchini cut real small like omelet mix so they were disappointing , I was thinking I would get pieces of vegetables  maybe carrots or broccoli.  This place is very low cost for what you get."}
{"text":"The food we had here was so yummy! Great atmosphere and very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this local family owned establishment so much, but I just cannot after my breakfast order.  I basically had eggs Benedict with sausage patty instead of Canadian bacon. It came with country hollandaise sauce even though I asked to keep the regular, the eggs were overcooked and basically boiled. When you cut them the inside yolk was solid. I mentioned to my server and although he apologized no attempt to reduce my bill was made.  Not very good service recovery in my opinion.  The hash browns were good as was the crispy bacon that I asked for. The coffee also was fresh to the taste."}
{"text":"I'm a bit undecided about my experience at this place. The food was not bad but I feel it to be a bit over priced for what I got. I ordered the Corn Beef Hash for breakfast. What I got was chunks of Corn Beef, very few sliced pan fry potatoes, and a whole lot of green peppers (Over kill in fact). I wanted to get my three year old French toast that was NOT on the kids menu, and was SHOCKED when told that one piece was $4.00. So I got him a pancake that was thick and sticky, (Yucky).  Another thing that I found to be strange for a restaurant is that when you walk in , they have a bunch of stuff for sale. Everything in fact. Clothes, pictures, chalk boards, it's like a flea market  Floor was very dirty.  After reading my own post , I don't think I would go back but this was my experience and you may want to check it out in hopes of a better one."}
{"text":"Today my lunch companion and I decided to try a new spot and our journey took us to Rustic Cafe which is just North of the 101 on Cave Creek Road. Rustic Cafe is a family run restaurant with an incredibly wide range menu that has something for everyone.    On my first visit I had the fired chicken sandwich with onion rings  and on my second visit I ordered the pancake, egg, and hashbrown breakfast. Combination of flavors, fresh ingredients and textures, and sensibly priced.    We found the breakfast to be okay. Although, the Hash browns were a little on the greasy side and the eggs were cold. The pancake was huge it took up the entire plate however I thought the taste was just kind of average. The fried chicken sandwich and onion rings I did not care for at all, both were very greasy.  The service, staff, and prices are great at Rustic Cafe. I will give Rustic Cafe' another shot maybe I just have to find the correct entree for me."}
{"text":"Cute little family run cafe. Very inexpensive, my omelet was six bucks and came with potatoes and toast. Been here several times tried several things which have all been good, only thing I did not like was their steak and eggs, the steak was not a good cut and tasted odd. Patio is dog friendly and they have complementary papers you can read."}
{"text":"Meh.  This place use to be so much better.  Owner is awesome.  Michael was also very friendly (haven't seen him in a while.)  Food is okay -- hit and miss depends on the day.  Unless they know you, you might think you're bothering the female wait staff.  Mom is friendlier than the daughters.  The daughters should go find a new gig.  You might catch the cook smoking out back.  Owner should re-engage.  Hire some help that love people like he does.  Just sayin."}
{"text":"First time here.  I had the \"The John Wayne Omelet\". Ham, sausage, bacon, and Cheese. served with potatoes and toast. I also had coffee with non dairy flavored creamer. My Alex had the \"Cheese\" Omelet. Cheese blend, provolone, Havarti, feta, Swiss or mozzarella. Served with potatoes and toast. He had Ice Tea. Really good food here, service as great and the restaurant was immaculate. We were here on a Sunday, only open till 3:00 pm.  We'd like to come back and try lunch some time :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Breakfast menu is huge. California egg sandwich was amazing. Great place and great service. A real neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"We do not come here as often as we should : ) Lunch after the movies. Daughter got macaroni and cheese, hubby some sort of chicken wrap, and I got the BLT with avocado. We were all very pleased : ) Service was good, and my sandwich came with a cute cup of soup: Chicken stew with chipotle : ) Service was good."}
{"text":"Great food all around. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner....always delicious! The wait staff is super friendly and accommodating.  Definitely a place to return to."}
{"text":"We met a friend for breakfast and we were very impressed with the food.  My wife had the 1/2 Belgian waffle and I had the Eggs Au Gratin.  VERY GOOD, they were baked with a version of Hollandaise, green onions and parmesan, very tasty.  Nice menu options, would stop again on another trip to Phoenix.  Easy to find, just off the 101."}
{"text":"This is our go to place on the weekends. We have never had a bad meal here or bad service. The staff is great!! I try to mix it up when ordering but tend to stick with their breakfast menu, which is awesome and a great price!  Beware of the pancakes...they are delicious but about the size of my steering wheel LOL too good to pass up though!!"}
{"text":"Bitchy review: While they do serve okay food, what is rustic about this place? It's nice, clean and new. Merriam Webster defines rustic as: of, relating to, or suitable for the country: rural *rustic rolling farmland*. OMG this place is NOT country.   Legit review: No seriously the place isn't rustic. Okay I'm done... the brunch at Rustic was just so-so. Coming from Chicago, we take brunch seriously and I was leaving a little be desired from my southwest omelet. And puh-leeze--I WAS IN THE SOUTHWEST. Call me an idiot, (\"you're an idiot\") but if I order a southwestern omelet, I'd expect it to be at least A LITTLE spicy as a main ingredient was chorizo. T'wasn't."}
{"text":"This is a nice hole in the wall place. Big servings great price. Lots of little Nick nacks on the walls."}
{"text":"First time here today and I'm impressed. Breakfast menu is massive and portions are huge! I had the Tuscan omelet and my sister had the farmers breakfasts. Bacon and hash towns were crispy, biscuits soft and moist, and the veggies in my omelet were cooked and seasoned.   I should note that this place gets busy, as do all breakfast places on the weekend, so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry. A woman at the table behind us is irritated about the wait and just about everything including the fact that it's sunny today and she's breathing fresh air so .. Yeah..   Great place, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed this place. We got the full Nelson burger and Italian cheese steak. Huge portions and basically everything is ten bucks. Both meals tasted homemade and everything was fresh and hot. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy were cold and biscuits were hard. Toast was supposed to come with breakfast. Did not get toast until we were 3/4 done with meal. Had to ask for sour cream which was supposed to come with quesadilla 5 times. Charges for an extra coffee.!"}
{"text":"3.5 rounding up to 4   Rustic Cafe was good for my first visit, not the best i have ever had but good.   Rustic = no neither the decor or the food brought \"rustic\" feeling.   The place is clean, cute and friendly. The food was good, quality and quick.   I had a 1/2 Ruben on sourdough with the salad. I wish they had a better Blue Cheese dressing as it was boring. The Veggies were fresh, the bread was good and the price was just right.   I will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"This place has some great specials and some really good food. I have tried a couple different things and have been happy each time. There service is good as well and they are friendly. I had the country fried steak last time and I was awesome I would certainly recommend you try that. The prices are also fair and you can feed a family of four pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I went here once with a friend for breakfast.  The food just wasn't good.  I won't say it was the worst food I have ever had, but definitely nothing enjoyable at all.  I've never been back.  It's too bad because it's the only breakfast place I know of in the area."}
{"text":"Super disappointing experience. Went with a large-ish party which may account for some of the underwhelmingness. Our waitress was cold and unfriendly. The cafe wasn't even busy but couldn't furnish menus enough for the group of us. Upon ordering, which was possibly the strangest ordering experience I've had, we waited 30 minutes for our food at least. Once we got our food, the portions were sparse and the names were deceiving at best. The \"rustic\" potatoes were scarcely seasoned at all and appeared to have little more than salt and pepper and a sprinkling of thyme or some herb on them. Most of our food was cold (granted, the party was large) and some of it wasn't even available (a huge sign in the window advertised Latte!, which was not being served today because the machine was broken). Several people's toast was burnt. Dude, it was just lame. The place is clean enough and maybe if you're there with one or two others it might be different. Basically though, it was just a bummer."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and have been here several times. Casual coffee shop feel with an extensive menu. Food seasoned well and wait staff attentive. Nice atmosphere. Popular with families so weekend breakfast time can be loud with some wait time. I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"To be clear, this review is for this meal and this experience only. I have been before and was mostly good.  I Ordered the corned beef hash this morning......not quite sure how they call this hash? If resembles more like corned beef fajitas. Huge 1\" square pieces of sliced corned beef, 1\" pieces of onion and slices of green pepper. I ordered on the Yelp app and got a confirmation email. When i got there they were like \"our bosses computer updated and we didn't get your order, what was it?\" I re-placed my order, paid and went to work. When i opened the meal i was super surprised. None of the onions, peppers or potatoes are even browned! The box was full of water and everything was al dente. Hash should be chopped up fine and be more corned beef and potatoes than onions and green peppers. Peppers don't really belong in hash but a a few diced can be fine. Mine literally looks like fajitas with an egg on top! I wouldn't recommend it personally and don't rely on the online ordering. It surely appears no one is watching it."}
{"text":"Love this place a very homey atmosphere along with great food and service. Not to mention they always have coupons and deals. This place is always busy and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Go here all the time.   It's close to my house,  foods good and service is great.   Very friendly.   The eggs Benedict is fantastic as well as the rustic club."}
{"text":"Food is cold and either bland or bad tasting. Had the Classic Benedict and the French toast and egg. Service is polite and nice, but super slow... My coffee, water, orange juice and whole breakfast was long gone before someone finally showed up to ask how everything was. Tiny place and still didn't see the staff during my entire breakfast time. Was told like 3 times I'll get a refill of my coffee right away... That never happened."}
{"text":"I ordered the Stuffed Pork Chop.. and it was great. I ordered through postmates, so I can't really speak about the vibe or service. But the stuffed pork chop was great.  Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and I was greeted as I walked through the door. The food is very well priced and very good."}
{"text":"What a great find!  First time here, had breakfast dishes, omelettes that were hot, filled with veggies and more than enough food (neither hubby nor I could finish our plates!) Our waiter was busy but extremely attentive, friendly and prompt.  Came around filling our drinks, asking if things were ok, and was genuinely nice and sociable.  These things seem like 'givens' when you dine out, but we find ALL TOO OFTEN that isn't the case!  Bathroom was clean, other staff members really friendly and when we left were told to 'have a great weekend, thank you!'   Little things to a LONG way with me, esp. after being in the restaurant biz for 5 years back in the day and knowing what it takes for one to be successful. We'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time it is delicious.  The fish tacos are very good and breakfast is always good.  I've had good luck with ordering whatever the specials of the day are."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tuscan omelette. Tasted exactly like egg foo young. Nasty! You can tell it's a fried egg. Not scrambled like an omelette should be. It was also incredibly oily! I even asked for no oil or butter. Yuck! I'm giving it 2 stars because I also ordered grilled chicken breasts and they were great."}
{"text":"First time here and we will definitely be back! We ordered a Breakfast Changa (eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, cheese) in a fried tortilla with a very tasty creamy salsa. We also ordered one GIANT salted caramel and bacon pancake. Everything was sooo good, including the service."}
{"text":"We went to Rustic Cafe today for breakfast because we saw that it had a 4 star rating.  Normally, yelpers are right in their assessments of restaurants.  This, hoewever, was not the case.  My hubby and I both got omelettes.  They were both filled with stuff, but quite greasy.  The hasbrowns on my hubby's plate were cold.  We were both frankly quite underwhelmed by this place.  The price point was good.  I am a stickler for tasty OJ at a breakfast place, thus I am taking a star away for the sole reason that the OJ was obviously from concentrate.  I don't even drink OJ from concentrate at home.  Why would I pay $3 for it?"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the overall experience. This place always looks amazing when I come across it on Uber Eats.  I don't usually order breakfast on Uber Eats but today I did. I ordered the veggie omelet that comes with tomatoes, broccoli, jalapenos, peppers, onions mushrooms and choice of spinach or artichoke hearts. I opted for no broccoli or olives and asked for spinach no artichoke hearts specifically. It said it came with my choice of toast, which I chose white. I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes because it didn't say it came with any sides other than toast. When I got my order, it was nice and hot. However I didn't get my toast, the omelet had no tomatoes or jalapeños like it said it would, but it did have artichoke hearts. :/ Also it came with hash browns so I didn't have to spend the extra money on a side of potatoes. :/ :/ The food was good however I wish it would of been what it said it was going to be. Especially when you're paying an extra $6.50 to get it delivered. It's not like I can send it back.... :/ Just a single mom trying to \"splurge\" a little. Dissapointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Big portions. Had to ask for coffee twice. Would come back again for sure"}
{"text":"First time today for a quick lunch on our way to Sky Harbor. We ordered wraps and both were very good. The chicken had good grill flavor. The sides were macaroni salad and slaw. Both sides seemed homemade. Our ice teas were very good too.  Our ticket was only $21. I felt it was very reasonable. Our server was fine. They need to fix the walls but the place was clean."}
{"text":"Had a delicious salted Carmel bacon pancake and hubby had a southwest omelet and our friend had a Tuscany omelt. Lots of fresh ingredients and nicely filled omelets. Friendly service and excellent prices. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here on an app that I use all the time. This place is by far the worst I've come across. My toast was so burnt it was black. The sausage was burnt, and paper thin, in fact ...I thought it was fake. It looked so rubbery and disgusting. The pancake was coming out of the food container...not sanitary at all. The hash browns tasted very very old. The only thing that was \"eatable\" were the eggs, but I threw it all out after seeing/tasting the rest of the nasty food. Stay far far away!"}
{"text":"Wanted breakfast after a nice morning hike with a friend. Searched Yelp and decided to try this place that was close to where we were.  The quantity of food was definitely more than enough but it was just ok taste wise."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times and it definitely a locals spot to eat. It's very mom and pop feel and they have a pretty varied menu, which was surprising to me.  We had their Mother's Day breakfast buffet several months back, and I have also had their spaghetti (which I've ordered on multiple occasions) - everything was tasty and service has been good each time as well.   My parents have already mentioned visiting this restaurant again when they come back for a visit - so I think that speaks to their verdict on the place!  Overall: A A good place to grab a bite if you are in the area.  It isn't anything fancy, but the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"First time last time. Worst food. Bad service cold food after waiting twenty minutes or more. Finally got second time food wrong order on plate. My husband's food looked liked crap on a plate.  Comped our meal. Big deal....."}
{"text":"After moving back to my old neighborhood we found this great little gym close by. The food was excellent and the service exceptional! The only reason I'm giving them a four-star was due to religious flyers posted around the restaurant regarding the meaning of Independence Day that were completely inappropriate and incorrect."}
{"text":"It started out promising enough.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated promptly.  Reviewing the menu, many of the dishes looked good.  Our waitress seemed nice (despite the really long red sparkly fingernails - maybe not appropriate for food service?) - she brought water and took our order.  Then things went sideways...  What we ordered:  Eggs Benedict with well-done hash browns, and the Arizona Burrito.    What we received:  Barely warm undercooked hash browns and poached eggs that were left sitting too long - the yolks were rock hard!  How long did those poor things sit before being served?  Ick.  The Arizona Burrito was supposed to contain eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes & cheese.  While it was large and impressive to look at on the plate, where was the meat?  A few paltry pieces could be identified amidst the egg/potato filling.  I would have liked to be able to ask to have my hash browns cooked a bit longer, or for my eggs to be cooked correctly, but our waitress DISAPPEARED.  Gone.  Where did she go?  Busy staff came and went (walking right by empty water glasses time and time again), but she was nowhere to be found.  She never came back to check on us, refill water or even give us our bill.  Another waitress passing by took pity on us, and went to find someone to bring our check.  Breakfast is supposed to be a good start to the day, not an exercise in frustration.  One more note - please remove the Christmas decor - it is the end of January."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here. Pretty decent food I'd recommend the southwest eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"What a unique place! The food is mind blowing! Had a bday here after hrs! They cooked what I wanted on the menu, they were so polite and efficient! Just loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money, food very processed, service sucked and will try and rush u out.  You can tell it's a family business, no one at the door and kids running around the tables."}
{"text":"Stopped here for Lunch after a mountain bike ride.  The veggie enchilada was absolutely delish.  We enjoyed the outdoor patio too.  We'll definitely come back again after rides in that area."}
{"text":"Great little local breakfast joint. The food is made in-house and fresh. Coffee is pretty darn good as well, a little light but good. Went on a Sunday at 10 and was seated at 10:15 so not a real long wait. We will return."}
{"text":"We've been driving by this place for years, and finally stopped in for breakast a week ago. It was great! Fast and friendly service, good food, and outdoor seating - so we can bring our 4 legged kids! We went back yesterday for lunch and had some amazing chicken and rice soup! It's a casual place that we will visit often now!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth stopping in. It's not far off I-10 so it's great if you're just passing through and don't want to eat at a chain.     The food was a bit average, but fair prices. The service, on the other hand, was incredible. We had a bit of a wait since it was busy, but the hostess got us seated as quickly as possible. Our server was wonderful in that he was very kind, attentive, and got our orders all correct. We couldn't have asked for a better experience with the employees.     The place seems like a hole in the wall upon first glance, but proves to be quite spacious once you're inside. The bathrooms are also quite large and clean.     I'd definitely say it's worth dropping in if you're passing through Phoenix."}
{"text":"I gave this place two stars because I use to love this place. I hadn't been in for sometime, but it was of my family's frequent breakfast stops. We decided to get some breakfast there and it was pretty busy. The thing that caught my eye was the barefoot little girl stuffing her face with chocolate hanging out around the front counter floor. It made me feel uneasy, but I tried to put it aside. My husband had to use the restroom and he said they were disgusting. Again we understood it was busy, but the thing that made us leave was when he saw the same barefoot little girl walking around the kitchen. We then left. I found it very unsettling to see a barefoot child walking around the parents restaurant and especially in the kitchen. It made me feel they didn't care about health code and I didn't want to risk getting sick."}
{"text":"We went here on saturday morning and the place was not busy, yet when we walked up to the hostess stand the young lady said she would be right back and proceeded to walk around the restaurant. So we stood there waiting and she came back and left again. If it weren't for the coupon we purchased at Localflavor.com we would have left. Another waitress came to the hostess stand and did not say anything to us. Finally the young girl came back and seated us. Our waiter was nice and my husband ordered the Rib Eye skillet which said was shaved beef but was really more like ground up steak, the hash brown potatoes which were not good were served on a separate plate. They give you a lot of meat but the eggs were over cooked and this was the worst skillet he has ever had. I ordered a veggie omelet and it was just okay. But the wheat toast was gross and they serve it dry with country crock spread. At the table next  to us the lady couldn't even eat here breakfast so the waitress took it off the bill. I have no idea why anyone eats here when on Sunday we went to Butterfields and had the best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Fried Chicken And 1/2 Waffle and The Boss had the 2 Eggs With 1 Pancake.  The pancake was literally a foot in diameter. She only ate half.  The sausage gravy tasted like it was made with turkey sausage, but my taste buds are aging faster than I am.  We sat on the patio and it was comfortable, try to get padded chairs versus wire mesh, shady and the temperature was in the mid 80's, nice by Phoenix standards.  The service was pleasant, but sssslllloooowww. It didn't bother us even though it was a weekday and lunch time. We were on R & R.  Yelp money back and coupons available making the prices less painful."}
{"text":"Finally remembered to try this place ! Such a cute little cafe with a variety of choices on the menu . I had the California Eggs Benedict with the hollandaise sauce on the side .. so so so good ! I could eat this entree every morning ! If your in the area you should definitely give it a try . You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and great owners!  I've held The 101 Referral Network Meetings there the second Thursday of every month for the past two years with never a problem. The food and service has always been excellent! They even designed a reduced menu for our group and allow us to modify it as often as needed.  Eric and his family go above and beyond making sure that each customer is satisfied."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the family feel .. never a bad idea to come to this place !!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time today. We ordered the breakfast changa and the green chili pork chop. Both were delicious. Loved that its a small local business with more exciting breakfast options than your standard fare, and the owner was super friendly as well.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overall they do the basics okay, the service and atmosphere is their downfall for sure. The waiters are sometimes not the best, food takes awhile, and the food quality is just okay. This place is so close to us and I wish it was a bit better. When someone asks us how this place is, we just say, \"It's okay\". So go here knowing that it's nothing special and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to Rustic Cafe in the past and service was sketchy at best but I thought that it has been awhile and I would give it another shot. I should have listened to my gut. As we entered the restaurant, we get seated immediately. Not a bad start. We were handed menus and that was it. We sat and waited to be acknowledged. The owner and the hostess then put together tables for a large party directly behind us. As the guests of the large party started to show up and be seated, the hostess asked each of them, \"What would you like to drink?\" All the while we sat still with no acknowledgement from any staff member.  6 people for the large party had shown up and each received their beverage. I then made the decision to leave and the hostess never even acknowledged our departure as we walked right past her.  Once I left the establishment, I called and spoke with the owner. All he could say was \"Sorry\". I try to support the businesses in my neighborhood and small businesses at that. You make your own decision.  Just remember, I told you so. A sad day for me."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and were greeted right away. The restaurant was very clean and cute. The entire staff was very friendly and the food was homey and totally had value for price. It was our first visit to Rustic Cafe, but it won't be the last!"}
{"text":"Just visiting PHX and happened upon this place. Saw the parking lot was filled up by cars so we figured it must be decent. I had the Green chili eggs bene. With chorizo hollandaise sauce. It was really good. Service was great, portions were just right!  Great selection on the menu!"}
{"text":"On our way to Cave Creek, decided to stop here and for once try a new place for breakfast.  When we walked in, there were a lot of young children in the restaurant, and it was very loud although not too crowded.  Dirty floor, tables hadn't been bussed, and what's up with all of the dresses and headbands up front? We were seated quickly, and were advised that the waitress would be around in a few seconds. Seconds turned in to 15 minutes to put in our drink order. We ordered the Chicago omelette and the Breakfast Changa. The omelette was over cooked and hard and the Changa was undercooked, and the bacon was almost uncooked. We never saw the waitress after she dropped off our plates, and had to ask 2 people and wait 15 minutes for our check. Fast forward to that same evening...my stomach is a mess.  This place has great potential, but until it realizes that potential, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know where the word 'Rustic' comes from in the naming of this restaurant.  There is nothing rustic about the food or decor.  But that criticism aside, Rustic Cafe was a nice little spot to get a decent breakfast.  I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with a half waffle.  For only $6, you get a decent meal at an extremely great price.  While the food didn't amaze my pallet, it certainly wasn't bland.  But am I really expecting a cook to reinvent over easy eggs, toast, hash browns, and a waffle?  It's a meal just about anyone can cook.  But the batter used for the waffle didn't taste like a mix, so that's better than I would have done at home (I would also have to get a waffle iron).  The generic individual jam and country crock margarine packets felt a little unnecessarily cheap.  Then again, the meal was cheap.  The portion size was perfect.  I was certainly filled up for the morning.  I would say breakfast at Rustic Cafe is more of 3.5 star experience, but I'm willing to round up since it's a small local establishment.  I wouldn't recommend anybody go out of their way to eat breakfast at Rustic Cafe.  But if you live close, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"We finally had an opportunity to try this great little place. We went for breakfast on a Sunday and were warmly greeted and seated right away. My husband order the Greek omlet and I had the Chorizo Breakfast Tacos with Rustic potatoes. Both were outstanding. Great portions and really good flavoring. It was like something I would cook at home. Tacos were more than filled with choizo, eggs, cheese and cabbage while the Greek omlet was the best we have had. Even the \"Rustic\" potatoes were deliciously seasoned. We defintely will be back as we eat at many breakfast places and Rustic Cafe stood out in their service and food quality. Many places we eat at are bland and nothing special. Rustic Cafe treated us extremely well and satisfied the home cooking quality we were looking for. Thank you Rustic Cafe for your great service and tastefully done breakfast.  As a side note, we liked the clean style decor and wood floors.  Lots of menu options - can't wait to return and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast and the overall experience was very good. We were seated promptly on Sunday morning and the waitress was great. She was very attentive even though the place was packed. I got the regular breakfast meal  but with meat substituted with vegetables. The portion size was smaller than most places but just right for me. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the food was nothing special. It was Denny's quality and I was expecting a lot more based other reviews and it being a locall eatery."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap was totally delicious, service great. Just found this place but will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, we had the mushroom soup (good) and my husband got the gyro (not good, pita was hard) and a cob salad (good).    Issues were, doors were open and flies all around (gross).  Also we asked if they could split the salad (no... Too much effort).  We asked that the soup be brought before the meal... No we had to wait.  Not impressed at all.  When we complained about the flies the guy just said \"oh, sorry\"... Really?  By the way, all my other reviews are good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the greek omelet and it was great. The staff is friendly and the prices are fair. I will be coming back to the Rustic Cafe."}
{"text":"Rustic Cafe has become a regular for breakfast takeout on the weekends for my wife and me. The food is consistently hot, fresh and delicious. The service is quick and friendly. When we are able to get sitters, we like to stop in for their classic, small town cafe feel. We have only tried their breakfast, but the rest of the menu is extensive and we look forward to trying lunch and dinner there one of these days."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. It was not greasy at all which I appreciate when eating breakfast. The service was quick and they always checked on us. Also the food came out in like 5 minutes!"}
{"text":"It is a small place but it has a nice atmosphere that lives up to its name. I like to get their eggs Benedict for breakfast."}
{"text":"I just received a phone call from Department of health from my negative and inappropriate experience at Rustic Cafe, see first post. They were in fact in violation for several conditions including hand washing. I attempted to educate this female staff worker who threatened to call the police on me and refused to serve me."}
{"text":"I needed to get breakfast and this was the closest option that was mom & pops that I could find.  Walking in was as others described; there's a bunch of crafty stuff for sale that just is out of place and I'm sure dusted more than sold. We were greeted and sat by a server promptly.   Service was alright in general, except this one odd detail. Once the food arrived everything looked fine, I ordered the rustic burrito, my partner ordered the country skillet and my little one got Mickey Mouse pancakes. His skillet was okay, bland but cholula helped with that. Her cakes were fine, just pancakes, nothing special. My burrito was terrible, unseasoned scrambled eggs with unseasoned hash browns, along with oily unseasoned sautéed bell pepper and some bacon pieces. Eventually I found the avocado that I had read about in the description, but it was too late, it's lack of flavor and texture overwhelmed any hunger I had. So there it sat, 5/6 of a burrito in the middle of the table. Once our server came to check our coffee and then drop off the check asked if we needed a to go box and we said no. Now perhaps I'm bias since I'm a server, but this is the detail that bugged me, at that point if this had been my table I would have asked of there was anything wrong with the hardly eaten burrito and if I could right whatever was wrong. But no, he just said ok and have a great day.  Odd no?  I won't ever eat here again & wouldn't recommend you to either."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while due to poor service, so we thought we'd try this morning.  Staff was cleaning up from a large party that had just left so our table was clean. We were the only ones in the place at the time but it still took 10 minutes to take our coffee order. We knew what we wanted and ordered right away, then waited about 40 minutes to get our food, which wasn't worth the wait.  One coffee refill, lackluster service. We left and will not be back."}
{"text":"Food and prices are good but i cant get past the sewer smell that engulfs the dining room."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu.... I mean like 3 full pages of breakfast options.  Everything I've had there has been phenomenal.  The only knock I would say is that they don't have a liquor license so... no Bloody Mary's w/ breakfast.  Nicely decorated and the staff there are always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is extra busy but that's the best thing. They have a few items inside that are for sell like dresses, headbands, rustic home items, and many more! I bought a cute Vikings baby dress for one of my friends. The food was great! I ordered the eggs classic and it was fresh. The food did take awhile but it was very busy as I said. Also, I love to support small businesses like these."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go. Granted it was a large order, but the sandwiches were soggy (I asked for them to be dry with sauce on the side) also asked for a side of ranch that wasn't given.. My boss's order was supposed to be a Greek salad with ranch and it didn't come with ranch either! This was very disappointing as I work in a small office close to the Cafe and was hoping we would be able to use them for our staff meeting lunches."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for take out. While the food is good they have never gotten our order right. The worst is getting home and realizing they forgot your side of grilled veggies or put tomatoes in everything you asked them not too.   The spicy chicken wrap is bomb...  But nit worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"I really like trying locally owned places, but this one just isn't that great.  I've been here twice with the same result.  Everything is pretty bland.  The biscuits and gravy is ok, but not very flavorful.  My potatoes were burnt and incredibly greasy.  The food isn't that great, but at least there's a lot of it. :/"}
{"text":"Mainly disappointed with the tepid, very weak coffee. Place looks OK and the interior was clean and comfortable. The waitress we had was sullen and offered no suggestions and dint smile the whole time, but then people are allowed bad days. Wouldn't return, especially as there are amazing places such as Liberty Market to compare it with (though far apart in distance and quality)! Food was only average. A lot could be done with a place like this as there is not much around, so we were disappointed as we were hoping to find a decent breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Service is very slow today. Have been sitting for 35 minutes. Had take our order as take out since we had an appointment. The Greek omelet was delicious though. Get there early to avoid the rush or give yourself plenty of time to enjoy your meal :-)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Been there twice now with the family. Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Right off the Loop 101 and easy access to get too. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a clever name.  Sometimes that's all it takes to get people to venture inside an establishment.  The decor is not rustic at all, not sure where the name came from, but it is neatly decorated in it's own way.  There are bright colored tiles on several of the walls that adds a vibrant feel to the place.  It's not like many boring chains out there.   I can't comment Rustic as a breakfast spot as I have only been here for lunch.  The prices are decent and they have a wide variety of options with many sandwiches to choose from.  Portions are very good for the price and presentation looks good as well.  The food didnt' overly impress me though.  Kind of your basic sandwich you could get from any restaurant.   I'd like to give this place another shot as it seems like they don't have all the kinks worked out with running the restaurant.  There is to much competition in the Phoenix area and if you're not on your game then there are enough places to absorb your business."}
{"text":"So this morning I came in to have some pancakes and some eggs. The pancakes were perfect as always. The eggs however were another story. I ordered soft scrambled eggs and got something that resembled an omelet. It looked exactly like the egg McDonalds serves on their breakfast sandwich. The waitress, Kimberly, seemed somewhat offended that I sent them back and asked to have the eggs removed off my ticket. She never apologized either. She just stopped by and dropped off my ticket and walked off.  Rustic is better than this."}
{"text":"Had Lunch today with the North Phoenix Chamber of Commerce.  Staff was excellent and our food was excellent as well.  You did a very nice job for our meeting.  What a great menu you have.  There was a food choice for every taste. Thank you Rustic Cafe."}
{"text":"The people were nice, but the food and atmosphere just isn't there.   The place has an awkward layout with a wall in the middle of it. They sell little girl dresses up front, which is unprofessional in my opinion. I came here for the food, I don't want to know what you do as a hobby. Sell that stuff in the appropriate setting.  Also, this is basically just me and a few other crazy people out there, but I don't like when waitresses/waiters are dressed too relaxed. I'm all about being comfortable at work, but the leggings/yoga pants that women wear should not be considered work attire. I just don't get it, it doesn't set the tone for me to hand over my cash.   With the above said, I expect the meal I got. It was cheap, basic and nothing I'd come back for.   My girlfriend had an omelet - the worst I've ever seen. Eggs were overcooked, toppings were scarce and you're supposed to fold in the ingredients, but it looks like they cooked the eggs, forgot about the toppings, and then stuffed them in the egg as if it were a shell to a taco.   My dad had pancakes and toast - or rather they brought him out French Toast in error (I mean, he ask for toast, the waiter asked what kind, and he said Wheat. How he brought out French Toast instead...) Again, my dad said it was nothing special.  I had over-easy eggs, hash browns and something else. I substituted the toast for sausage, but they brought me out toast anyway. I switched with my dad and ate his French Toast. Eggs were as to be expected, not much you can mess up there. Hash browns were minimal and too crispy. The sausage was a patty similar to what you'd get at McDonalds.   Overall, we had 3 different breakfast items, all three weren't what you'd expect to pay for, the coffee was probably something cheap as usual, and overall the awkwardness of the place just didn't do anything for me.   The one thing I did not like at all and would have to complain about though was the little girl helper. Cute, but c'mon, I don't want a kid who just stuck her hand in her mouth to then hand me my plate of food. I'm not a germ-a-fob, but c'mon!!!! The place wasn't terrible, but I'd rather drive a few miles down the road and eat at a good breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I have passed the Rustic Cafe quite a few times, never knowing this was a sit down, dine in spot. My sister suggested it on a friday night, so we ended up going on before a movie. Really cute decor-and really good food. We shared some bruschetta, and all had sandwiches. My fish sandwich was fantastic-though my husband felt his spicy wrap, was not spicy at all. Definitely will go back and try breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast, never eating any other meals there. Very quaint restaurtant, the day we were there the waitress had her daughter following her around which was very cute.   The food is good. I've had the Arizona Burrito and Eggs Benedict both on more than one occasion. My wife loves this place. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Love this place, yummy breakfast everytime.  One of my favs eggs always perfect, if you ask for crispy hashbrows also perefect.  Nice size portions for real decent price.  Coffee refilled before it is empty."}
{"text":"Your average mom and pop diner, a step up from denny's. Food and coffee was just okay for us. Got the country benny and chicken fried chicken.  Service was good though and prices were low."}
{"text":"I've been here twice as after the first experience I decided to give them another chance before writing them off.. BOTH times had to wait ages before being shown to a table and the same for service afterwards. Second time sat at the table over ten minutes before a server arrived - never got a coffee refill either, in the end had to hunt her down and ask for one - NOT GOOD. A shame as the food was, but I like to go somewhere where I can order and enjoy my food in a reasonable amount of time and drink coffee with it. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The breakfast was amazing!  Everyone in our group ordered something different and we all raved about the freshness, flavor and presentation.  From a Greek omelet, John Wayne omelet (lots of breakfast meat), fried eggs over hash, or my own Breakfast Sandwich with turkey/egg/ avocado/ spinach and more on rye bread, we each gave 5 star rating.  The coffee cup was never left empty, either.  Definitely will return here."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast..love the eggs Benedict and the hash browns are killer. Always get great service and prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"Seated right away, our meals came right away. They had amazing food, the green chile benidect was perfect! Corn beef hash was different looking, but still really good. Only problem was they were a little understaffed for waiters which made refills and the check a little delayed."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday Lunch and had a wonderful experience. The service was very good and cozy. The people were all friendly and prompt.   I ordered the Ham and Swiss- Rustic Style with a side of the Reuben soup and pumpkin spiced latte. I loved all of it! My friend ordered the gyro and a salad and both looked incredible. The portions are large and the food is rich so make sure to order small.  I had a delicious experience at Rustic Cafe and I will be going back.   I would make sure to ask for your pumpkin spice latte extra hot and be sure to inquire about the specials!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent food but their service is so lacking to leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  They are clearly VERY understaffed and it's unfortunate because their food has a lot of potential.  Sad to see."}
{"text":"I'm SOOOO glad that I was given a coupon for a free breakfast for THE RUSTIC CAFE.  I know its a breakfast/lunch establishment but they DO stay open until 3 pm and open at 6:30 am.  They are open 7 days a week - so - you can have breakfast any time of the day you like.  My personal favorite breakfast item is the Country Style Eggs Benedict - the best of both worlds. Hollandaise sauce AND a hearty country gravy with bits of sausage in it.  The menu is quite extensive for being a smaller local restaurant.  For example:  Chicken Marsala, Quesadillas, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches, Wraps, Pasta, Fish and several Meat entree's.  The waiters are all very accommodating and the owner, Eric, makes appearances now and then in the dining room.  A dining reward program \"sweetens the pot\"!  To view their menu online:                www.rusticcafeaz.com I'm almost ashamed to admit this but I go there 2-3 times a week!"}
{"text":"I love the people that work here, they are always very friendly and will go the extra mile to provide great service. The food is VERY affordable and the quality is better than average. The food is amazing- I recommend the corned beef hash-it's made fresh(not from a can) and is very scrumptious."}
{"text":"Really cute quaint little place with great breakfast choices one of my favorites is the egg white breakfast and then I had a side of cottage cheese very healthy. Also really really good eggs benedict with avocado. Only downside is I wish they had their liquor license so you could have a mimosa or Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Saying \"everyone can find something on our menu to satisfy their tastes.\" Is a complete lie!! Nothing here for vegans/vegetarians. I don't like false advertising."}
{"text":"Good food.  I had the biscuits and gravy with hash browns and eggs which were delicious.   The kids had Mickey Mouse and butterfly pancakes, so cute!   My husband had the egg sandwich and said it was great.   Tables are close together and no outdoor seating.   Would be nice to expand to a larger location."}
{"text":"Was very excited about trying this place out just to be let down. The biscuits n gravy we ordered were all ice cold,. The bathrooms had no toilet paper or a working paper towel dispenser and were very dirty. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"3.5 rounding up to 4 stars  When I think 'rustic', I think kuntry cookin', painted wooden signs with pithy sayings, and a hearty slathering of Paula Deen's cure-all: butter.  It didn't live up to its promise of rusticity for me, but Rustic Cafe has a lot of other things going for it, like great prices, lots of menu options, friendly service, and a bright, cheery, dining room with nary a sign spouting down-home wisdom in sight.   My first visit was on a Saturday morning and I administered the ultimate breakfast challenge: sausage and OM eggs with toast and hash browns. Sounds simple, right? You'd be surprised. Rustic Cafe, however, had no problem delivering the goods: hot, timely, and perfectly cooked. The hubs ordered biscuits and gravy, and though he thought the gravy was a little under spiced, he said he would absolutely go back.  On another visit for lunch I split the gyro (which I don't think can be classified as 'rustic' unless you pronounce it  JY-RO) and french fries. It was just the right size for sharing and gob-smacking good. They even added pickles and extra toms at no extra charge. BO-NUS!  This is definitely a no-frills neighborhood place, but it's one I hope will be around for a long time. Maybe even long enough to get 'rustic'.  P.S. I think it's really more of a 'Nod to Nostalgia Cafe'. With brightly colored tiling on the wall and a couple of classic car prints, it seemed kind of  50s diner-esque, without the kitsch."}
{"text":"Dined here twice over the past few months at a friend's request. He isn't a foodie, but the food is adequate, and well presented. I had the pasta olio with chicken and garlic toast, and felt  the food was well matched with the price line. Servers are friendly and competent, and atmosphere is casual and pleasant."}
{"text":"Came for our usual monthly meeting that meets here on Thursdays (101 Referral Network).  Ordered the Chicken Ceasar Wrap that came with Steak Fries.  The sandwich was excellent and the fries were fluffy, and not greasy.  It was excellent choice and the owners were so gracious and attentive.  It was the perfect meal, not to heavy, not too much.  I will order it again and again...my new favorite!"}
{"text":"To the owners: We waited to be seated for ten minutes and finally grabbed menus and sat ourselves. Another ten minutes before wait staff took our order. Twenty minutes before anyone greeted us at all. Coffee was basically hot water, the food took twenty minutes and was nothing special. I am a supporter of entrepreneurs and small businesses so I hope you can step it up. Lots of bikes ride past you every weekend on our way to cave creek. Social media can make or break you. Good luck."}
{"text":"We ventured back to Rustic Cafe on Sunday, this time for breakfast and really enjoyed it. The service was great as was the food. Way too much to eat in one sitting.   Ultimately they probably have a few kinks to work out, but it's been darn good both times we've been there."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for this place and thought I'd give it a try on a recent lunch break from work. When I walked in, it was as another reviewer mentioned, filled with odd trinkets and little girl dresses for sale, which I found strange but not a turn off. And as a yet another reviewer shared, the woman who was at the front only asked me how many (it was just me), grabbed a menu and didn't utter another word as she walked me to my table. If that's their first impression, they need to improve it ASAP. She was not friendly whatsoever. No smile, no \"how are you today?\", zilch, zip, nada. Fortunately, the server was friendlier. I ordered a pink lemonade and looked over the menu. I inquired about the Lemon Herb Chicken to make sure it wasn't breaded (the whole GF thing), and he assured me it was not. It came with a side so I chose the mashed potatoes. The meal came in a reasonable time. The chicken was lukewarm and not hot, like it had been sitting under a warmer or something. It didn't taste bad, just not freshly made. And it was served with a lemon slice on top, but the chicken itself did not taste lemony, only herby. The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes and while not bad, had a ton of green stuff in it, parsley maybe, too much IMO. My overall experience is what prompts the two star rating. The lady at the front should be warm and welcoming. The meal should taste fresh and not pre-made and maybe cut back a bit on the parsley, or whatever, in the mashed potatoes. I will likely not return."}
{"text":"Always a good meal and good service at Rustic. Very clean place friendly staff. Great little breakfast joint."}
{"text":"This little place is definitely worth a visit.  Primarily a Greek menu but a little bit of everything.  I think you will find something to your liking.  It's been a while since we have been here but wifey and I went several times for lunch and enjoyed it very much.  Not a lot of seating but clean and nice, comfortable decor.  Hot hostess.  I've also done take-out a few times and it has always been good.  Only reason it doesn't get five stars is they seem to always be short on wait staff and it can take too long to get out of there if you are working to a lunch deadline."}
{"text":"Our first visit here. It was ok. We had quite a wait to get in, super busy place. It's an A rated place, so I can see the wait. My husband ordered a burger well done, but it came to the table very pink. The lemon pepper seasoning on the steak fries was a little overwhelming as well. We had a hard time getting any refills on our drinks too. It was pretty noisy, but going to chalk that up to the tight quarters. They really could use a bigger space.  Loved the décor, and really loved that you can buy it. We had a good time reading all the different little signs. Turnover was pretty quick, and place was clean considering how busy they were.  Everyone there was super friendly.     Restrooms could have used some extra attention. They ladies had urine all over the seat. Otherwise, it's an ok place.  Maybe if they were open a little longer they may not have so many people trying to squeeze in so close together, lol.    I would try this place again at a later date to maybe try and give a better review. Maybe we just showed up during one of those days that's a fluke.     I would say, try it! Prices are reasonable, three of us ate for about $35."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Fresh and healthy and service excellent??? I had the bagel egg white sandwich and my husband has Denver omelette and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food is a little plain and not cooked to order. Burnt bacon and overdone eggs.  They did give me half off the bill."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with a friend and selected this restaurant based on previous reviews. We had a concern about poor service comments and the staff being overwhelmed. We however didn't experience this!  Our server was attentive, the food tasted great and the cost was very reasonable. We had the Farmer's Breakfast and Tuscan Veggie Omelet, with drinks the bill was $25. We look forward to a return visit!  Written by Fork of Fork N Knife/Knife N Fork...be sure to check out reviews by my critic in crime, Knife!"}
{"text":"Quick service, solid breakfast. Very friendly staff. Expansive menu. French toast was well prepared with good flavor.  When we want an inexpensive breakfast- this is our go to. It was clean and fast table turnover.."}
{"text":"Group of 6, 2 of us shared a plate. When we walked in it was relatively busy (they had to move tables together for us). I had looked through the current photos for a sense of the food and noticed how many things were covered in gravy. Decided to avoid that and got a Mediterranean Grilled Cheese with a side of mixed cooked veggies ($8.50). It was a fairly small sandwich with a decent size side, but compared to other pictures it overall just looked small. The sandwich was good but overpowered by the saltiness of the olives. It also was cooled down, no doubt from waiting around for the rest of our order to be finished. The grilled veggies were too wet and oily with an over abundance of onions. They really could have done with baking them instead of what I assume is just throwing them into a pan of oil. What should have been a healthy side was sadly lacking in care and a balance of flavors. The other orders we received were decent but the two California Egg Sandwiches which were both supposed to be served with avocado were both lacking that. Coffee is watered down, too. Just visiting, but if I was local I probably would go elsewhere if you're looking for a good pick me up in the morning."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was slow in the kitchen.  Our waitress was very sweet.   The patio is dog friendly but no designed for the summer as they do not have any fans, misters, or music.  So it gets pretty uncomfortable out there fast.   I would strongly recommend updating the patio to keep up with your competitors."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered Smoked Salmon Cesar Salad - Would never order it again. Salmon wasn't \"smoked\" to my liking. The texture was off.  The salad had dressing on the side, which in my opinion, isn't appropriate when it comes to a Cesar salad. It should be tossed beforehand. My Mom ordered the Greek Nachos - They were awesome! Something I would never order but ended up eating 3/4 of it. Feta, olives, Pita chips, calamata olives, artichokes, scallions, greek herbs, feta, and Havarti cheese on a bed of hummus. The freshly made pita chips are soft yet crispy around the edges and very good. I'll give this place another shot for sure. The couple next to us ordered breakfast and it looked delicious. They serve breakfast all day which is nice."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have gone if I didn't have a coupon. The food isn't spectacular, and just ok. There was a 15 min wait even though there were plenty of empty tables! The waitress couldn't have done a worse job in taking our order. Somehow she managed to screw it all up even though she wrote it down. Grape juice came out grapefruit juice, multigrain bagel came out plain bagel and no tomatoes came out tomatoes all over the plate!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always try to have breakfast out on Saturday's before we run our errands. We decided to start our day at Rustic Cafe'. The decore is kitch and fun. I did notice a couple of chairs that could use new upholstery, but that is not a huge deal. I orderd the chicken fried steak breakfast with over-easy eggs and sour dough toast. The chicken fried steak tasted almost exactly like my grandmother's. I was amazed! The gravy was amazing with huge chunks of sausage. The best part my eggs were cooked exactly as over easy not a running mess or undercooked like most places deliver. My husband had the AZ burrito and it was HUGE, the bacon and sausage gave it great flavor. The only thing that he would have changed was maybe a little salt and pepper on the potatoes and eggs. The homemade Salsa is AMAZING as well. We will be going back! GREAT FOOD for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times. The first time I got the pancakes, which were huge! Not only were they huge, they were very reasonably priced as well, 2 pancakes were about $6. I ate about 1/4 of one of the pancakes and was stuffed. The second time, I ordered the French Toast, again large portions at great prices. The pancakes & French Toast aren't the best I've ever had, but they're better than most of the other places I've been and you can't beat their price point.  The location is great, super conviennt for anyone who lives by the 51 or 101 can get there in under 15 minutes. The service is attentive and professional. This is one of the best places I've been to in a while up in the North Phoenix / Scottsdale Area. I would definitely recommend coming in to check it out. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Such a great lunch spot with great service!!  Tons of options for everyone, including healthy options.  I had the grilled fish with veggies and rice, and it was super flavorful and well cooked.  The servers were very nice and were very speedy.  Will definitely go back again for lunch and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The night I dined here there was a business meeting going in the main dining room. So we were forced to sit in a tiny area in the front if the restaurant. The lights were up all the way ruining any chance of ambiance and we could hear the entire meeting. They had a chalkboard advertising many different coffee drinks, but the machine was broken. My friend had the meatball sub and I ordered a salad. Both were ok, nothing special. The server was very sweet, but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent biscuits and gravy.  Chilaquiles were tasty and the pico de gallo was  fresh made; you can tell it was made from scratch. Everything was great."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, most recently I ordered the fettucine alfredo with chicken and I must say it was REALLY good.  If you like buttery creamy sauce with grilled chicken breast and noodles, this is great.  Service hasn't been the greatest either time I have come here though which is kind of annoying.  Also, this building is relatively small, although there is an outdoor patio.  It appears to be a brand new building too which is kind of nice.  Also, there is a TV in the main dining room so you can catch sports or news or whatever."}
{"text":"Still a great place!  I had the country eggs Benedict and it was amazing!  My husband was very happy with his green chili eggs Benedict as well.  Decent iced mocha also.  Great service, affordable breakfast.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Showed up mid morning for breakfast. Waited several minutes to be seated. Waitress finally took our order. Drinks severed several minutes later. Whole time there only refill. Food came half hour later. Waiter claimed the cook couldn't read the writing of the ticket.  Food gave me diarrhea. Very dissatisfied and will call health department."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place and have tried it for lunch several times.  The only thing we found that was consistently above just \"meh\" was the beef ok wrek whih is ok.  This last time I ordered the Mediterranean grilled cheese.  Not only was it not grilled, there was one puny slice of Havarti for the whole triple deckersandwich!  I mean, isn't the key ingredient in a grilled cheese well, cheese?  I had to hunt for it!  Plus, anything listed as \"Greek\" or \"Mediterranean\" will tast bland and nothing like what you would want or expect if you know Mediterranean food at all.  You are better off going to Culvers next door or to Pita Jungle if you want Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Stopped as part of a group of 5 who needed to get a quick lunch (we had about 25 minutes). Asked the young man at the desk if that would be possible. He said he would check. Came back and seated us, waitress appeared, water served, orders taken, food came out very fast, waitress brought check right away. Wow, what great service! And on top of that everyone's lunch was delicious. The fruit side was fresh, the green salad was crisp, the cole slaw was creamy and delicious. Both the regular and Mediterranean grilled cheese sandwiches were wonderful, as were the BLT, chicken pasta, and waffle. Great service and great food. We will eat there again."}
{"text":"A year or so ago I visited this place for breakfast. I got a pancake and it was gigantic! So gigantic that the middle wasn't done. It was gross and I had to send it back. A few weeks ago I got a different breakfast dish that was OK. I doubt I'd come back though."}
{"text":"went back for a couple of times this last week and was very impressed by not only the food but the staff!  Much better w/o our grandsons-but they even enjoyed it despite their typical kid behavior.  Loved the \"healthy\" chicken hash w/ egg whites on the first trip. Hubby had the greek omelet that morning.  It looked so good that I \"healthied\" it up by switching egg whites, tomato slices and took out the cheese-still looked and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Decent prices and large portions but food lacks flavor and the omelettes had wayyyy too much cheese. I postmated my food and the bottom of my to go box was just drenched in grease. Not necessary. But the iced carmel macchiato was yummy."}
{"text":"This is a nice little breakfast place, still family style. It's not as ostentatious as the others, you would probably have to look on Yelp or TripAdvisor to find it. Good thing its right by my house...makes it a quality choice in moments of laziness. Service is always top notch, food is amazing. So far my recommendations go to the rib eye skillet and the chorizo con queso Benedict. Coffee is also good. They brew a medium Arabica roast. I'm a regular here, and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I wrote a review on this restaurant about a week ago.  Now its gone.  I wonder what happened to it??????"}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant place was busy but service was not there. I had the salted caramel and bacon pancakes and they were salty. My companion had the chicken fried steak and it should never have been served as it was charred.  Waitress was only the there for order and her money. Senior discount given after asking twice. Gratuity added without explanation.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.   I've been going to this place since it opened and today will be the last time I ever walk through that door.   I called in my order for lunch at 12 o'clock and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. When I arrived there I stood waiting for someone to acknowledge me. When the girl finally did, I told her I was there to pick up my food. She asked me if I ordered something other then what I called in. After correcting her, she took my money, and I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited some more.   After standing there almost 20 minutes a woman came to talk to me. I explained how this was my lunch break and didn't understand why it was taking so long. She told me it wasn't taking long I hadn't put my order in until 12:23.   The lady kept arguing with me and then informed me that I needed church.   I hope no one makes the same mistake I made by going to this place."}
{"text":"The homemade corned beef hash was amazing. Good portions,  great prices. Highly recommend.  My fiance had the John Wayne omelette- great size and tasty."}
