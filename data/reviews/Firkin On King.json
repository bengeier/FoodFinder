{"text":"Loved this place! First visit to Toronto and after walking around all day, decided to eat here on a whim. We sat on the patio which was very nice, good people watching view, and not too loud. I had the coronation chicken curry wrap which was AMAZING! Very unique twist on a wrap and I loved it. Hubby had some kind of brisket sandwich with au ju sauce which he also really liked. We had great service, a very friendly and attentive waitress who did a great job. Really liked this place and would recommend it and return!"}
{"text":"Great service, and a nice side patio. Consistent and friendly. Food was very quick, but not overly tasty. Still satisfies the basics for pub grub or a brunch spot."}
{"text":"Generic. Bland. Greasy pub food.   Also, why sit here when there's a much better pub a couple doors down?"}
{"text":"Firkin was amazing. Waited at the bar for a table and the bartenders were superb. Atmosphere was brilliant. Got to eat outside in a very dark yet luminescently inviting environment. Beer and food were terrific!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I had been to a concert that happened earlier and we went to a bar afterwards for a few drinks. Once we left that bar, we were on our way home and two of us needed to use a restroom very badly. We saw this place on our way and it was around midnight so we figured we would be allowed in no problem - however this was much to our dismay. We were met with a very rude bouncer who was obviously on a power trip. We asked if we could be let in just to use to washroom and he said no. We offered to pay cover (if there was one) and buy a drink or food there and he still refused us. We were a little intoxicated yes, but we were not belligerent or blackout drunk or causing a scene. (Obviously, because I remember this so vividly lol) and a lot of other businesses were closed at this time so we couldn't just go use their restrooms. We are all adult women that are of age to drink so there was no concern there. The bouncer was not understanding of the situation at all. I can't comment on the food or other staff at this establishment because we were denied entry and for no apparent valid reason. I highly recommend crocodile rock if you're looking for a place that will let you in and has reasonably priced drinks. Needless to say, I was not impressed at all with my \"experience\" here at the Firkin on King."}
{"text":"Came here after work to get a bite to eat with some coworkers. The service was great. Our server was very attentive especially considering how crowded it was. The drinks came out within minutes of ordering and everyone's food came out at the same time, which is always great. I got the black bean burger which was pretty good. I didn't like the bun. Others in the group all liked their dishes. Overall, it's an easy place to hang out after work. And the fact the food and service are good make it worth going back for more."}
{"text":"Very mediocre... do not order the Turkey Cobb Salad... fish and chips were just ok... don't sit near the rear of the patio unless you want to sit where everyone smokes... a gross looking rock just feet from the patio seems to be the smoking rock.  Service was very nice unfortunately she has to serve shitty food."}
{"text":"I am literally in shock right now that this place is not the set of a reality prank TV show.  It looks really nice in here and the menu looks promising... But this bartender is a complete clown!  I cannot adequately describe how weird the bar service was. First of all, this guy asked me our food order three times, I watched him spend ten whole minutes putting our order into the computer (while other patrons were in need of service). And the food STILL came out completely wrong. Like wrong as in nothing was right. A completely different order ended up in front of us.  When our new food came it was still not completely correct but I was finished arguing. They did end up comping the food bc of all the confusion, thankfully.  As a bartender, I want to give this guy the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he had some crazy life crisis going on today that was causing him to be functionally comatose, but that's when you need to either suck it up and work through it or let management know you need to leave bc you're not all there."}
{"text":"Let's be realistic, this is a review for a firkin. All firkin are essentially the same this one however happens to be several stories high and has a dance floor and DJ on Saturdays. This was key to our adventures last night. We left the disappointing marben down the road looking for a place we didn't have to pay $14 for a drink. We were a large party so we were lucky to get a separate little side party room when we arrived. It was about 10 and the DJ started off with 90s pop music which we were serious fans of. Our waitress came over to order drinks, can't comment on the food because we didn't order any. All night long the DJ kept the tunes pumping, the waitress was fairly good she checked in on us often enough but I secretly think she hated us more and more as the night went on and we got crazier and louder. She also left about 3 drinks off my bill when it came so I can't complain. Overall if your in the area and looking for a easy going place to dance this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Service was slow. There was a hair in my nachos.   A random guy put his hand up my skirt and I told the security guard and he just laughed.  Very unimpressed with the service and attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"What you get at this Firkin is pretty much the same as any of other pubs in this chain. The pub fare is pretty good. They have a ton of seating with a cavernous seating area downstairs.  However, if I were looking for a pub in this neighborhood my first choice would be Fynn's of Temple a couple of doors down the street. It has a much better pub feel to it. The food is also a notch or two better.  My biggest peeve about this place is the high beer prices. Yes, I know this is in the King West area, and the concept of 'cheap' does not exist here. But the draught beers are priced pretty much at what they cost at the Bier Markt, a block west. And this place has nowhere near the ambience, or beer selection offered at BM. If you want to a regular pub, then the prices should reflect that..."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy. Who lines up for a Firkin? Not me. Thankfully we arrived before any lines formed. Typical awful Firkin food. Why pretend that you are an English pub when you only serve bar food (Nachos etc)? The place is busy and full of millennials but so is this whole area. Truthfully, this whole area has the same crowd and same type of food. Not my thing"}
{"text":"Comical from start to finish. Five of us ordered brunch and the only thing that was cooked from scratch on any of the plates were the eggs, which were still cooked terribly. The rest of the food must have been straight from the freezer aisle at the nearest grocery store. From the frozen tater tots to the \"breakfast sausage\" (old el paso taco meat?), the Breakfast Tatcho was an absolute joke. On top of this, the server was absent throughout the entire meal and refused to properly address errors in 2 of our party's orders. Overall a very negative experience that I can not recommend to anybody. Learn how to firkin cook!"}
{"text":"Solid experience, and a nice break from the pretentiousness of King West.  I came here with a friend the other night on our way to meet others and go to a rooftop party, and I was pleasantly surprised when I remembered this restaurant, located right near the corner of King and Spadina. From first glance, the patio entrance seemed to be part of Brassaii (located just down the walkway), but we were soon told otherwise and were ushered in by a friendly waitress.  Decor's pretty much your standard Firkin, but the space was surprisingly huge and there was plenty of room to sit. The thing I loved the most was that their drink prices were surprisingly reasonable. Usually, when you go down to King West, you have to pay an arm and a leg for a drink, even at a hole-in-the-wall bar. I was quite impressed that the prices were reasonable.  I had the fish-and-chips and a beer, while my friend had a veggie burger and salad. We both agreed that the food was solid, and the waitress who served us was very fast and efficient.  Had a great time here overall, and will be back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What you would expect, nothing too special. Decent but not huge variety of beers. We did have a friendly server who was prompt with menus and getting our drinks to us. I haven't had food here before so not sure what the menu is like. I do know, based on another person I was with, that their menu does differ from their usual moving into the late evening hours so that's something to keep in mind if you're going for a bite."}
{"text":"Irish Pub très sympa situé pas loin de King St W et Bathurst. Super pour les groupes. La pinte de Moose Head est a 4$!"}
{"text":"I normally don't go to chain pubs, but I have to say this one isn't bad. Lots of nooks and different seating options -- and you shouldn't have to worry about getting a seat because I literally mean LOTS. There are lots and lots of seats."}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 and they accommodates us quickly. The food was good but the music was loud for a pub and I found myself having to yell. All in all really good but they need to tone it down for a true relaxing pub experience IMHO.  I am from Nova Scotia and we have great pubs here, this one isn't as good as the pubs here."}
{"text":"A good time was had by all, as we hid by ourselves in the room just off the front door.  Keep in mind they card everyone when you go in, so even if you're obviously 40 years old, better remember your ID.  Service was friendly if not a little slow, as they were very busy.  This place is nothing special, just a pub that gets good and busy, even with a line-up once it got closer to midnight.  Good location, that's it's main attraction."}
{"text":"Had a relaxing lunch here on a weekday. The patio spots are quite nice, and given it was really hot and sunny outside, we were given the choice of shade vs no shade...hugely appreciated this. Our server was welcoming and extremely accommodating...We ordered their $5 taco Tuesday special; our waitress gave a fair recommendation and clarification on portion size, from which I decided to try one chorizo, one fish...the chorizo was a bit heavy on the sauce but the fish was quite good. Not enough guac in either though. A friend requested his taco to be stripped of the fish and replaced with tomato and olives, which they kindly accommodated. Great service, good food for a decent price."}
{"text":"The place is very big, you can almost always find seats. That being said the place is a bit sketch inside, down stairs isn't so bad, and the patio is nice! The last time there was a DJ behind the bar and a riser and some laser lights pointed to the floor with a few guests hiding in the dark #sketch. Since I was after the patio it was fine. If ur heading to a club along king street and just want to get a quick cheap pre drink this is the spot! You will be served fast, you will find seating!  As for food, it's Irish pub fair, like ever other firkin. Deep fried, or burger , or sandwich, or salad, a few fancy things hit the menu then and now."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and drinks (average pub style) and 4 stars for good service. Would come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Classic Firkin pub, but with an outstanding location and atmosphere.  As they say in the Fuccillo Toyota commercials, this place is \"HUUUUUUUGE\"!  No really, its like a maze getting downstairs.  I counted 2 bars, 3 levels of seating, and a large patio in a cute enclosed alley.   This would absolutely be a great place to bring a large group.  Service was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Portions were massive.  Will be back for drinks and appz for sure."}
{"text":"We were looking to catch the Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals and simultaneously satisfy our hunger. This lead lead us to the one part bar, one part restaurant Firkin On King. The decor and feel of Firkin feel like a restaurant that at one point considered being classy, but decided not be too full of itself in the end.  I was looking to keep this meal within the diet, so I was delighted to see that the menu at the Firkin lists the caloric value of each of the dishes. That plus my love for all things Mexican drew me towards the fish tacos. This surprisingly delicious meal somehow came in at just under 800 calories! You'll get two medium sized tacos, each featuring deep fried basa, pico de gallo, red cabbage, guacamole, sour cream, chipotle, and lime on the side. One of the most apparent aspects is the beautifully fluffy basa meat complemented with the crisp of the batter shell. From there, the rest of the flavours pair oh-so well. The pico de gallo and lime give it great zest, while the guacamole and sour cream set it off on the creamy-buttery front. The whole thing tasted plenty fresh, and I came away really happy."}
{"text":"Its an old style English Pub. Huge downstairs area where we watched the NCAA basketball tournament Daily Specials, food and beer. A good selection of on tap and bottle beers. Typical pub food, with an English tint.  Large patio space too."}
{"text":"Made online reservations and had never been to this pub before.  Our group wanted to try something new and we were not disappointed.   Service was fun and friendly and when we first arrived we even had a mini tour and talk about the history of the building. this location is gorgeous, clean and stands out as a new favorite   .  Wings...delicious and the suicide was actually on fire.  So awesome   We had burgers and they were great.  Somehow during our evening we ended up in various elf hats...holiday gathering?  This is the place.  Love you guys!!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night.  I had the turkey burger ($14) and a glass of house white (only $5).  My friend had the crispy fried chicken sandwich.  We were very happy with the large portion sizes.  My turkey burger tasted great with the goat cheese.  My friend's chicken has just the right amount of crispiness.  This place has standard pub fare which is reasonably priced.  Our server was extremely busy running around but was as attentive as she could be.  It was a bit loud to chat at a normal level but I guess it's Friday after all so it was packed and the music was turned up.  I would visit the Firkin On King again."}
{"text":"Firkin is the perfect place to make you feel like you're still bro-ing it up with your college friends.   Although Firkin pubs are a chain, I honestly really love this location. They serve generous servings of nachos, their drink deals really aren't that bad, and its a really great place to stop by with a big group of friends.  The pub itself is casual, and offers different atmospheres based on where you are - so if you're looking for a patio, a social club, a bro-out, or even a post-work brew the Firkin is a solid selection."}
{"text":"They threw a cool St. Patrick's party.  I also think it's nice that they have two levels.  We didn't try any food."}
{"text":"I have to give Firkin on King about 3.5 Stars based on my post dinner visit there.  They had plenty of draft beers to choose from and although sitting at night was challenging to read the drinks menu, we managed to get our order in.    I shared a pitcher of a white ale with orange slices with my friend and got some fries with curry sauce poured on top.  Who would've thought that fries could taste this good?  Fries + curry?  Magic!  Although it started to rain outside in low 80 degree weather(F, not C), we moved inside and our servers were helpful in moving our stuff out of the onslaught of rain.  One of the servers actually tracked us down afterwards because one person in my group forgot to take his camera from the table.  For that, they are bumped up .5 stars for going above and beyond for us.  Firkin was a decent locale for a Saturday night hangout but it was eerily empty on the night we went.  Hopefully they will still be around if I do come back to Toronto in the future."}
{"text":"The Firkin On King is obviously not the fanciest gin joint in Toronto (though based on the renos happening at some other Firkin locations, they would have you believe that they are), but I still really enjoy my weekly pub date with my college friends held at this location on King.  We prefer to sit downstairs; it's always a bummer when the lower section is closed and we are forced to sit upstairs.  The downstairs section is usually quieter and full of cushy booths and soft lighting that is really appealing after a long day at work.  Not to mention you'll find the washroom facilities downstairs.  Trust me, it's no fun to have to trek up and down these stairs if you imbibe a little more than you were expecting (or maybe you've imbibed just as much as you were expecting...no judgements here).  We are looked after by the same server every week.  I am ashamed that I don't know his name, but at this point it's way too late in the game to ask without feeling like a jerk.  Let's call him Jeremy.  Jeremy is really nice, typically remembers our orders and preferences, and makes sure we are looked after every week.  He's funny, and takes the time to joke with us and ask us how our weeks are going.  I like places where you can form a personal relationship with the staff, but I guess I have a romanticized vision of what being a \"regular\" entails.  The food isn't anything to write home about, but it's filling and inexpensive.  My personal favourite?  An order of Irish nachos (found on the appetizer part of the menu).  You can't go wrong with waffle fries, cheese, and bacon.  Yum.  I also heartily recommend the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  I don't have anywhere to compare it to, but it always comes out piping hot, covered in caramel and whipped cream, and always cheers me up with its gooey goodness.  I can't speak for the men, but the ladies washroom is always clean and well stocked.  Also, the last time I was in they were running an ad on a screen by the sink featuring David Beckham in his undies.  Naturally, I made sure to use the facilities at least two more times that evening.  All in, I probably spend less than $20 there a week (I'm not a big drinker), but I'm never made to feel like I'm taking up space or wasting their time because I don't want to pound back beers.  We'll definitely continue to make this a weekly tradition (until a new place strikes our fancy)."}
{"text":"Drinks are so watered down you shouldn't even bother. Service was so slow. Waiter hit on me the whole time. He suggested that my breasts were the motor boating type. 0/5 would not recommend to a friend. Apps were served after desert WTF?!?"}
{"text":"As mentioned by others, this place is a-ok, pretty average. We stopped in for some drinks while walking along King - the menu has an a-ok list of drinks. The patio was pretty nice - it was crowded on Friday night so we could only get a table inside. Maybe it was a good thing? The A/C was working well inside. The interior is quite spacious with a lot of tables and chairs. This place would be perfect for groups when jonesing a drink or two. Service was friendly - it did take some time for our server to come to us, but it looked like she was alone inside. I haven't tried their food so I'll have to update my review if I come back here.  Good for: groups, after-work drinks"}
{"text":"This is a very big bar at a convenient location on king, close to the streetcar. The downstairs is a little rundown but it sorta has a cozy feel to it. I ordered the fish & chips which was delicious. Our waitress was personable and nice. Very satisfied with everything really! :)"}
{"text":"While I'm not big on Firkin pubs, I will say that this is my favourite of the bunch.  The inside is less run down than the others I've been to, and the patio is nice being tucked down the side of the building. They have regular drink specials ($9 giant mugs of MGD on Thursdays!), and also got a lot of other stuff in the area for a good night of bar hopping. Admittedly when I was there last time they had live music (guitarist/singer, bongo guy) and it was unbearably loud, but Im not sure if thats a regular thing.  So while I wouldn't define this as a destination to plan for, when in the area and looking for pub food and drinks, its a safe bet."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group with work for lunch. They are very accommodating with large groups. It was fairly empty when we got there around 12.30pm and it didn't really fill up for lunch either. The appetizer bucket had a good variety of deep fried things, excellent guilty pleasure food. Their nachos were also huge, just solid pub nachos, same with their hummus just regular not complaints.   I got the chicken and waffles for the main. Again the portion here are generous. The chicken was moist and the gravy hit that salty satisfying craving and the waffle was not hard or chewy so overall actually pretty good. It also came with roasted Brussel sprouts which are my fav so I enjoyed those.   The service was attentive and the inside was clean. Nothing outstanding just regular ol' pub stuff not bad not great."}
{"text":"Came to Firkin On King as a last resort at around 10pm on a Saturday night (mind you- beautiful night in Toronto so no blame here!) as all other options to seat 5 for last minute drinks and food was looking to be slight impossible. Decided to walk into Firkin and since we there was a 0 minute wait time, decided to give it a shot. Getting drinks and food, no problems. Speedy service in all ways possible. I ordered the poutine- should be simple I thought. Fries, cheese, gravy. One thing I will note that was quite the pleasant surprise..... alongside my fries was tater tots! I've never had this before I and I enjoyed it! Just as I had eaten about half my meal, I noticed that he gravy was getting quite sparse. Almost as if the gravy covered the top layer of fries and not throughout. I ordered a poutine. Not fries. The waitress Jaclyn came over and I pointed this out to her and asked if there was any way possible to get a little more gravy (didn't want to make a big deal and mention that o just had fries as it was also cheese-less) to enjoy the rest of my meal. No problem! My gravy was delivered by a kitchen staff. I didn't think anything of it at this point. 2 more beverages later, my group and I called it a night and asked for the bill. Now comes the part on why I wrote this review. I was quite disappointed the change- yes... $1.00. However, not the point. I had pointed out the gravy-less fries to Jaclyn as almost to fix the small mistake (of the kitchen staff or possibly that's how much gravy goes on the poutine? An opportunity for management to look into?) and for an opportunity to fix it.  I am an avid Firkin goer as I frequent the ones more north. I am not sure if they are owned individually or what is up but I was quite disappointed by this. I would lie if I said I would never come here again if I was in the area. However it left a bad taste in regards to poor customer service. Would never order the poutine if I knew I would be enjoying the last half as fries."}
{"text":"Oh dear, the service here was not very good. Beer is beer, so that was good, but we ordered a pitcher and our server poured it so badly my boyfriend almost took the pitcher from her to pour it himself. One glass was so flat she had to take it to the bar tender to pour us a new one. The other one had a bug in it LOL. So she got us a new one. Then we didn't see her the rest of the night. The space is nice, I'm not the biggest fan of Firkin pubs. This one was no exception to my rule."}
{"text":"You would never know that there was a downstairs to this place unless you paid attention walking along king street to see the downstairs from the outside. The top floor looks pretty dark and plain with simple floors, high tops and a bar, but then you wander downstairs to a completely different atmosphere. It is more lively, with bright red velour banquettes all around the room, spacious with TVs on the corners to catch different sports games. There is a great selection of beer and their cocktails aren't bad either. My caesar was on par and saw some other drinks come out with some craft and flare. The place does get a little loud, but still allows a group to carry on a conversation. I didn't try the food, but for a pub, they have a large assortment and seemed pretty upscale. I looked on their website and it said that the firkins were serving GRANVILLE ISLAND BEER! That's pending location of course, and this location didn't have it :( Just gotta keep on searching."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of pub food but the Coronation Curry Chicken Wrap may possibly be one of the BEST wraps I have ever had. Beautiful side patio in a courtyard and wonderful service, I'll be sure to come here again next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Good English-style pub food. I had a turkey sandwich for lunch. The waiter was friendly and patient, and checked back frequently to ask if we needed anything (which we didn't). I noticed that the \"small\" size for the nachos snack was huge!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this bar once and have never been to the other establishments that are owned by the same group.    It was later into the night, right after dinner; a group of co-workers wanted to grab a drink and decompress from the day of travel.  We happened upon this locale based on a few recommendations from the locals in the area (literally a rando person on the street).  It was chilly out, so we made haste to find this place!!!  The inside was DARK and you're met with the main bar right when you walk in.  We had a larger group; so, the staff pulled a few tables together for us (hi-tops).    I didn't order anything off the menu to eat, but did have a few local brews on tap (Molson's and an IPA).  A few others did grab food, which looked good; they had no complaints, but also weren't blown away by the fare.  I'd stop here again for a quick drink, but I'm guessing there are better places around downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Solid pub food. Above average wings. Fried pickles were also pretty good. Nice little patio tucked off King St as well so good for a summer evening."}
{"text":"Not my typical scene but met up with some friends there for drinks on a Friday night.   The space is BIG and it's fairly nice. Drinks weren't cheap (15 bucks for 2 pints of beer) and I can't comment on the food because I was being bad and drinking on an  empty stomach. Woot!  I would hesitate to recommend this place to my friends as a place to go out drinking - it just lacks character and doesn't have a very 'fun' vibe. However, if you need a large space to get together with a group, Firkin on King works. There is a ton of seating and it's not so loud that you have to shout in peoples faces to have a convo."}
{"text":"In Toronto for work for 10 days, this place is right across the street from work and we've been a bunch of times, like lunch almost every day.  I've always lied the food selection and since the beers are new to me I can;t make any complaints.  Seems to be pretty busy at most times in the evening, regardless of the night of the week.  Fish and chips was really good, as well as the Firkin Burger.    What I really like is the staff, always super friendly and many people in my party think their wait staff is pretty gorgeous.  I met the owner one day and he was also very friendly.  Good music selection.    Apparently they are a rather large chain but before visiting Toronto I'd never heard of them.  I can;t say I'm dying to visit other locations around the city, country, or world, but this specific location has met all my needs."}
{"text":"The bartender was super nice but the server with the neck tattoo was an absolute bitch. Asked to order food but she said there was no food left. Yet she brought out food to a table a minute before I asked. Twenty minutes later she brought out food to another table. I asked her why people kept ordering if there was \"no food left\" but she looked at me, completely ignored me and walked away. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The last Sunday afternoon of the month is worth it (weather permitting you to sit outside on the patio) for the spectator sports alone. Watching those colorful pretty young people (if only in their own minds) wandering into & out of the club next door is hilarious.  Otherwise, nice beers on tap, decent pub grub & service. The basement bar area looks real cool... would definitely check that out sometime especially if a good game is on."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, and was a regular with my bf once or twice a week for a few pints and to watch some of the jays games or maybe football on sundays. Sunday brunch menu is limited and their beer specials they have on their website arent available, and werent able to substitute. A great server would have been able to honour this. This is a place to go to once in a blue moon but not not a pub that has memorable staff like tou used to or food selection that makes you want to return"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here and it was a decent, fairly quite location. Their venison sausage special was fairly decent, and not gamy, even if it was a bit chewy. The basement is more cozy than the upstairs."}
{"text":"Came here Thursday afternoon and sat at the patio.   They have Thursday specials - $6 strongbow (now where do you ever find specials on cider?!) and $9 fish and chips (small).  The fish and chips special was actually a perfect size and filling.  I tried the fish tacos and it was alright.  I'm not a big fan of the sauce and whenever I took a bite, the sauce/liquid would spill onto the plate.  The fish was battered and tasty though.  Would consider coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food at this pub is truly dreadful. I've gone there for a few work lunches and have been thoroughly unimpressed on all occasions. The beer selection is pretty run-of-the-mill. ok, no surprises there. But what gets me about this place is what they charge for the awful food. That and how long it takes them every time to bring the food. I think we waited over an hour one of the times.  If you're just going to grab an after work beer this place is acceptable, but I would not recommend having a meal here."}
{"text":"Great place for good pub grub nearby. Consistent, friendly, tasty. Can always get a table but high ceilings means it gets noisy when there's a big table nearby or it gets packed.   The stuffed Yorkshire Pudding is awesome at $8, good fish & chips, beef dip, and burgers. Friendly, tentative staff keeps the fluids flowing ;)"}
{"text":"I've come to hang out at this place a few times now. If you walk in and feel like it's a bit small, then you haven't yet seen the basement. The decor is appropriate for a pub, the menu has plenty of good food to choose from (they are very accomodating with making alterations to your meal), and the staff is friendly.  Everytime I have been here, I had a good time. I'm sure you will too."}
{"text":"So I checked in here a few weeks ago, I was on the patio, had a lovely server named Sarah, and the food was decent. The whole experience was great!  We went in, took a seat. There were a fair amount of people in the place, but it was not packed. I'd say at 60% capacity.  So at our table we wait for service. A man (Mike) came to give us menus and take our drink orders. I hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu, he asked for our drink orders. Granted I assume a lot of people order the same thing every time, like my husband. My husband replies with his usual beer order. I was unsure as to what I wanted, and plus I was to be the designated driver of the evening (I assume most bars/restaurants like to ensure responsible drinking) so I replied \"Water\" just because I needed more time. The waiter replied (condescendingly?) \"oh party!\" I was slightly taken aback by this...I just needed more time! and Sorry If I was trying to be the responsible one of the evening.   He came back with the waters and took our orders We ordered 3 lbs of wings. The wings were delicious! We had the honey garlic, maple siracha, and jerk. So the honey garlic were exactly what you'd expect, sweet and slightly garlicy. The maple siracha were good, SPICY, but good! and the Jerk, well, more pepper than the traditional \"smoked\" flavor, but still, pretty tasty.   So, as I start eating my carrots and such, I decided that I'd like a pepsi, (Again, being a DD, but wanting something sweet and carbonated) I looked around the place, hoping to see our waiter. No such luck. I waited/looked around a good 5 minutes before I signaled to the hostess standing at the front, asking if she could send our server to the table! (you'd think there would have been a table touch to see if the wings were to our liking, or if my husband had needed another beer, which he had needed for the entire time we had been waiting for our server to check in. Another server (Laura i think?) came over and took our drink orders. She continued to help for the rest of the meal, packing up our doggie bag and bringing us the bill. She was clearly running a few tables, but still was polite and thoughtful with us.  It seemed rude that the first server, after his judging comment about my \"party\" or lack thereof... wouldn't, a. tell us that he was going not be our server anymore (as most usually do if they are going on break, or if the shift is ending, giving me the option of closing the tab, or bill, tipping for initial service etc)   Anyway, I hope our tip went to our second server, she was lovely."}
{"text":"Firkin is an honest and solid A-OK bar.  And I mean, it is really a bar - not a restaurant trying to look like a bar, not a bar attempting to impersonate a restaurant. Just exactly what the bar is - a place to get some fish and chips, while listening to the good ole' live music (Thursdays) and drinking beer.  Everything at Firkin is absolutely normally bar'ish. Servers are fun and smiling, when they notice you. When they don't, they are not. Food is well prepared, no surprises. Beer selection is not that abundant, but at least not one of those \"Canadian or Moosehead\" places.  I actually enjoyed the time spent at Firkin, and would definitely not hesitate to drop in, being by the zone. Without live music, though, it would not be that attractive."}
{"text":"I little rundown looking but great service and excellent pub fare! Stopped in for lunch during the summer and was warped back in time to an old style English pub! Nice wine and cocktail list (I don't drink beer so can't judge on that one) Also the salad I had was much better than you would think you could get from a pub. Being on King and relatively close to the airport this is a nice quick spot to grab lunch that I will likely be in again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time. To be honest, it's nothing special. Cookie cutter Firkin pub, mediocre food, cheap ice, and one if the worst Caesars in town. It's a big Ice filled glass, with a tiny bean, and lemon. It's like they don't even care.   Basically, if you're here for anything other than beer, it's a wash. This place is all location, location, location and. I thing much more.  It's good if you have a big group of people as there's plenty of room and big tables and just want to have some greasy food or hold an event.   I dunno. Any place that denies you celery for your Caesar and insists you have the shitty bean loses points in my book, mang.   TL:DR Drink beer here. that's it."}
{"text":"Overall a great place for drinks and to spend with good company.   Food- ordered the calamari, spinach dip, and mac and cheese. Overall just okay. Nothing too extraordinary in regards to food. Just basic pub food but have various sorts of selection for a pub.   Drinks- they have drinks specials. I came here when they had $5 wine specials. Pretty good selection of drinks  Overall experience 3/5. Good service. Quiet (on the night I came). Would come here for drinks and snacks if I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"Food is quite crap and overpriced. They can get away with the pricing only because of their location (King Street West of Spadina)  They do have a decent patio but the service is so slow I don't think I could be arsed to re-visit and wait ages for my mediocre overpriced food and drinks.   You are better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants and avoid them at all costs. However, I did tell my husband \"I didn't care\" when he asked me what I wanted for dinner so we came here, my bad! Turned out for the best - the menu had the calorie count right on it!  I ordered the chicken and waffles with Brussels sprouts and my husband had the fried chicken sandwich. Both were really good and keeping the calorie count in mind I was able to happily save half for my lunch the next day. I was surprised and very happy to see Brussels sprouts as a side! If anyone is interested, the leftover fried chicken is good in a wrap and stayed pretty crispy, score!  The patio was nice and semi private. Service was VERY good, first time in a month of eating out that we didn't have to wait forever for the bill or the machine to pay.  This place definitely changed my perception of what a chain restaurant could be!"}
{"text":"An Okay Bar.  They have domestic beers on tap and TV's to show the game."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and despite it being game night and super packed, this pub was not a let down! We had to sit at the bar, because there was absolutely no space upstairs or downstairs (well other then the bar downstairs). I kind of felt bad for the bartenders, but they kept up and helped everyone out in a timely manner. They even kept apologizing for the delay! Definitely a nice pub to come for drinks with your friends, watch the game, etc. The vibe was amazing. I would be back if I'm in the area!  P.S. you have to show your ID upon arrival during the evening (we went on a Friday)."}
{"text":"We tried the Nachos for a King (4 people), but it was actually GIANT. Like a solid appetizer for a group of 8.   I ordered the sangria and their arugula salad with chicken. The sangria is okay (some blueberries and citrus fruits in it). The salad was okay, with arugula, brussel sprouts, and chicken. The chicken was bland but at least they had a pretty healthy option!"}
{"text":"I went to the Firkin on King for an Oscar viewing party with friends.  My friend goes there every week for games night.  We had the private room.  I ordered the sunday special which was the chorizo Mac and cheese for $8.  It was well worth the price and a good size portion.  The staff were good but not the regular staff since they were having a staff party.  My only complaint was the hard  wooden benches that made it hard to get in and out without making everyone move.   And after hours of Oscar watching your butt gets sore.  There were some sound sync issues with the tv but thats nothing we couldnt deal with.  Other friends food orders looked good too."}
