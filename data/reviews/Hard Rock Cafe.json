{"text":"I went here because I was staying at the Sheraton and needed something to eat. I had heard of the Hard Rock because, well, everyone knows about the Hard Rock franchise. Upon entering, it looked nice enough, and the chairs were pretty comfy (especially after a day of walking). We had a big group (7 people) and were seated quickly (there weren't that many people there). The service was quick, but the food was only ok. Everything was so spicy! Even just the chicken tenders were spicy! LITERALLY EVERYTHING WE HAD WAS SPICY! It was a little disappointing when we left a little hungry and our mouths burning. The major pros was that it was clean, and that the food was alright aside from the spiciness in every bite."}
{"text":"We had fun looking at all the memorabilia and playing with the Microsoft surface while we waited for a table. Other than that, the food, drinks and service was normal for Hard Rock - subpar."}
{"text":"I wast here to attend the Tuesday Blend event.  The security was not the smartest bunch. The ID checkers let in SO many underage people, simply because they couldn't do math correctly. I am not really complaining, because I have underage friends, but still... it was kind of funny.  There were 2 guards in particular who were constantly checking Kalila for a 21+ wristband even after she had repeated showed it to him so many times.  The venue served its purpose and we had a good time, but that was thanks to the people who came out and our friends who produce the event. As far as I'm concerned the HRC was a good sized venue with annoying security (except for the guy next to the escalators downstairs -- he was cool)."}
{"text":"Awseome place with great food and awsome music. Especially like the ribs here."}
{"text":"Typical of hard rocks, same music videos, same mediocre service.  You get what you expect. Would have liked see a live band playing or something, after all it is Vegas.  They had some cool unique memorabilia that we enjoyed scoping out."}
{"text":"Good service. The food not so much. Bruschetta was good with added avacado. The Texan sandwich not so much. I ordered it with pulled chicken. Chicken was dry and not appetizing. Didn't make my mouth water let alone give me a reason to finish it. BBQ is supposed to be one of the menu's more popular offerings, I don't see how. Again service was good didn't need to ask for more water or condiments, service was good on time. Our server talked a little fast and was very good at up selling. I'm not mad at that she is doing what she is supposed to be doing, girl was a hustler and had me leaving with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at this place. They got a pretty awesome collection of guitars, outfits, and other stuff of famous people. At arrival we got our seats very quickly. After one or two minutes our drinks were served by a very friendly server. The food was also served very quickly and very tasty. Crispy bacon, perfectly cooked eggs and very great roast potatoes. What do you want more to start a day?  Besides, there was a guy on a small stage providing live guitar music and singing. He played some famous rock songs. Really appreciated it.  Worth a visit every time!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! This place is very consistent in every location. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"We got there and told them we had a party of 8 but wouldn't seat us until all 8 arrived or even take our name down. When the other 4 arrived they wanted to seat us separate like opposite sides of the restaurant. Told us 15 to 30 minutes and seated people they arrived AFTER us BEFORE us. After 40 minutes. We said something. Got us two tables not together. Finally. If it wasn't for our server it would have been horrible. Very disorganized and hostess couldn't even do their job. Won't come back. Only reason it actually got one star was due to the server."}
{"text":"When HRC was on Camelback, we frequented the bar for happy hour.  During that time, we befriended the bartenders, who are still there  They create a neighborhood feel to this international chain.  Phoenix HRC is different than the other ones I've been to because of this.  When they moved downtown we continued to frequent the bar.  Number 1 reason to drive downtown for happy hour - the bartenders Javier and Eddie.  They have incredible memories and pick up the conversation you ended with the last time you were there, and that could have been 8 months ago.  They are quick with the drinks and with their wit.   The food is ok and over-priced, but that comes with the HRC name.  We have found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating.  A neighborhood HRC bar...hmmmm.  Sure feels like it."}
{"text":"You know the drill. Like McDonald's, Hard Rocks are all the same. This particular one stood out due to the manager (and if that's not who you are, you should be!). We were at the bar, watching videos. He stopped by to comment on the Def Leppard video, saying how they didn't make them like that anymore. I shared that I had taken my grown kids to see them last summer, with Poison. Off he went. A couple of minutes later, he was walking by and said 'this one's for you'. It was Poison! Thanks for making our experience special."}
{"text":"if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a \"Rock\" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"The food was good.  This is what you would expect at a place like this.  They decorated with what you would expect in a place called Hard Rock Cafe.  It was just way too loud to hear anything.  After 30 minutes in the place, I felt like my head was ringing.  It is kind of hard to enjoy the food when you have a speaker over your head on full volume.  For the love of god, someone lower down the volume!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and if ur cool with your waiter/waitress they will give you 20% off your whole check if you do them one favor make sure to ask! Good music great atmosphere great food"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty good, servers were attentive, but the food was sub-par. I personally ordered the chicken marsala, and I really should have sent it back because it was overcooked and tough. Also lacking flavour. Best part of the dish was the pasta accompanying it. Not remotely worth the price."}
{"text":"Das Hard Rock Café liegt am Strip in Las Vegas, in unmittelbarer Nähe vom Hotel Monte Carlo.   (Siehe Foto unten)   (Siehe Foto unten)  Wenn möglich, einen Platz am Fenster reservieren, von dem man den Strip sehen kann. Das Essen, wir hatten alle Burger in unterschiedlichen Varianten gewählt, ware lecker. Die Preise sind für Las Vegas Verhältnisse ok. Auch Vegetarier werden auf der Speisekarte etwas finden. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und bediente uns zügig."}
{"text":"When I go to Toronto, I love to eat at this place. Great atmosphere and the food is actually awesome! For being in Toronto, it isn't really too expensive and the portion sizes are really great.  Last time my wife and I went down (before we had our child) we had an amazing server who knew everything about everything on the menu. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing atmosphere in Toronto and doesn't want to spend a crazy amount of money."}
{"text":"So glad to see a downtown Cleveland restaurant thriving! We waited a short time to be seated. The only reason I don't give this experience five stars is because we were seated during a shift change and the server that took our order was at the end of her shift and cranky. After she left, everything was excellent. My husband had the bbq'd chicken and I had the fish and chips. Chicken was described as \"the best flavor and good portion size\". The fish and chips was served hot and was very tasty along with good slaw and predictable fries. A very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here since my last trip to Vegas. And I'm glad I did! It was just the same. I had the Twisted Mac N Cheese which was delicious and Darren had the fish n chips... Fantastic... The bruschetta was great... My salad I tried the pear dressing which was a bit odd but a bit good at the same time.. Good. Our server was very nice. I felt a tad rushed and think they need to wait a bit between apps and main course and not ask if I am done while I am eating lol but over all I'm glad we have one here in Phoenix! I also think they need cloth napkins.. The paper ones are kinda lame."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average food compared to other HRC around the world. Guess that's vegas for you!"}
{"text":"The Hard Rock Cafe in Station Square offers a brunch buffet on the mornings when the Pittsburgh Steelers have a home game playing at 1 pm. This review is specifically about  their buffet, not the regular menu.  Following the genre of music, I'd say to the Hard Rock Cafe, \"Don't quit your day job.\" Most of the other guests in the restaurant were ordering off the menu, so I'd say its a pretty universal opinion.  For about $16, the buffet was unremarkable. In the warmers, they had premade scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, french toast sticks and pierogies. There was a small collection of pastries, muffins, and bagels -- only butter and cream cheese for the bagels. Two cooks helped with omelets -- they had their pans filled with a partially cooked egg and cheese mixture, to which they would add peppers, tomatoes, ham or bacon. The result was a very fast but very dense/flat \"cooked-to-order\" omelet. There was also a bowl of cut up fruit.   Next to the omelets was also some kind of beef roast that would be carved on request. I guess this is what made the buffet \"brunch\" instead of \"breakfast.\"  Basic institutional fare: the french toast was dry (there was some warm syrup you could add), scrambled eggs in big cakes of egg, selection of pastries/muffins very minimal (e.g., two kinds of Danish), no toast, no English muffins, no cereal (hot or cold), no pancakes, no waffles, few bagel toppings. No egg beaters, egg whites or eggs besides omelets/scrambled. The fruit looked (and tasted) like it came from a can with the usual syrup. No other deserts or fresh fruit. The beef was well cooked (i.e., well done) and a bit dry but tasted ok -- it would help if they had knives to cut the meat rather  than just the butter knife provided. Perhaps the one outstanding good thing was the pierogies with onions. If you got the ones on top, they were pretty good. The ones on the bottom of  the warming tray got so hard that you could barely cut them with the utensils.  Service was fine -- the cooks at the buffet were prompt and the servers took away plates and refilled drinks. I don't think they refilled the buffet table -- looks like it got filled in the morning and stayed that way thru game time. I did hear a football trivia game going on in the room next door, if you like that kind of thing.  Be aware of parking -- it's hourly at the east end and a flat $10 \"event\" at the west. If you are there only for the food, go east. Staying for the game, head west.  If you want the Hard Rock menu, I'd say \"enjoy.\" If you'd like something in a buffet before the game (or on Sundays without games), I'd point you to the Grand Concourse just down the block. It's $25, but a lot more for your money."}
{"text":". Cant remember servers name sorry and i did not let manager know about food issues. I dont like to send food back to the kitchen. I have heard about to many bad experiences when people send food back. It seems crazy that i should have had any issues like this from a Hard Rock Cafe. I appreciate your quick reply and i hope the cooks in the kitchen learn to check the food before sending it out. That is restaurant 101."}
{"text":"12/1/2013 - My family and I stopped for an early Sunday dinner.  It wasn't busy because there weren't any games taking place and everyone else was out of town.  We were seated right away and there weren't any kids' menus.  The hostess went and made copies for my 2 youngest children and made sure that they had their crayons.    Our server introduced herself as MK.  She was very friendly.  We got our drinks and our server MK asked if we wanted an appetizer.  She suggested potato skins or the combo.  We ordered the Jumbo Combo.    My oldest son and husband decided on the 10 oz. burger, my daughter ordered a kids cheeseburger and I got one of my usual orders - Chicken Ceasar Salad.  MK noticed that my younger son was enjoying the wings and suggested he order the kids chicken with the Buffalo sauce.  He did.    My husband and son both liked their burgers,  my daughter ate most of her's (she is a picky eater), my son liked his chicken and my salad was as good as usual.  We gave MK our email address for the Hard Rock Cafe Rewards program.  We have been customers of the Hard Rock Cafe chain for at least 25 years.  We have visited HRC from Hawaii to Florida.   We preferred the other program where we would give the server our card and earn points that could be used to pay part of our bill."}
{"text":"Worse ever!!! Sat there for twenty minutes with NO service...not even anyone asking if we wanted water or ANYTHING, although we had numerous wait staff pass by our table and glance over. This was my son's first time in Vegas, and we just wanted a relaxed dining experience. Crappy service for over priced food. I complained as we left without ordering anything or getting service. The guy at the front asked where were we seated....it doesn't matter!!! The service was non existent regardless of the seating arrangement!!!"}
{"text":"awesome food, great atmosphere.  our waiter was very nice and helpful.  take a cab if coming from the strip, it is a long walk.  but a free shuttle will return you to the strip after your meal"}
{"text":"Completely average food. I felt the food was way overpriced for what I got. I ordered the chicken sandwich (has a fancier name but wasn't memorable so I forgot) and it came with only a little chicken. I ordered a chicken sandwich from Exacalibur's pool cafe and it was three times the size!!! And much tastier! What gives? Maybe it was just an off night but overall I felt it was just average. Btw. Lower the music just a tad I can barely hear myself in there."}
{"text":"Inzwischen gibt es neben dem alten Hard Rock Cafe auch ein neues direkt am Strip. Das neue Cafe wirkt allerdings noch sehr steril. Essen und Trinken ist wie in allen anderen Cafes und dass die \"Service-Kräfte\" immer gut drauf sind, versteht sich von selbst."}
{"text":"Great bartender, not so great food...ordered nachos found a hair n lost my appetite. She did offer something else but like I said lost it. Bf had a club sandwich. It was SO dry. Fries were great though. Drink specials were the best we'd seen around so far happy hr."}
{"text":"We went here after the NFR. Gotta say,  I was pretty disappointed with the service. The food was good, exactly what I'd expect from thehard rock, but the place was nearly deserted and we still had to wait forever for our food. They had items on the menu that were not available. Based on our experience,  I would recommend skipping this one."}
{"text":"Johnny B was our waiter and he was great!!!  Same for the manager.  Had a great time with great service!!!!"}
{"text":"this is a nice looking restaurant with the worst service I had at a resturant in over 30 years I would not recommend this place to anyone even if it was free. the Burch buffet looked good but upset my stomach as soon as I ate it. Almost all the food was frozen cold"}
{"text":"Would have given zero stars if that was an option. Over cooked meat twice. Ordered medium rare and both times it came out closer to medium well. By the time our server came by the table others were almost finished with their meal. So I asked for the second one to go. It came back boxed and ready to leave, until I cut into it to make sure. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"It's a great place to pay 15 bucks for a hamburger. The staff is good but it's really pricey for really average food. I've been once and there is no need to ever go back."}
{"text":"Was there on Wed. June 17.  Was there with my husband who was in a wheel chair.  They sat us right away, I asked for a booth right from the start.  Booth seats feel better on my husbands legs.  So this blond gal takes us to a regular table and removes a chair.  She says, roll him here.  There was a whole wall full of empty booths near the doors where the food comes out. I said can't we just have one of these, she turns silent and starts mumbling into her walkie talkie, I said again, can we sit here, she's still ignoring me talking in to that damn thing.  Then she just points to the booth and walks away. So we literally sit there for no less than 10 min until the savior of the experience shows up and says \"are you guys being helped\"  I said NO.  She said \"don't worry guys, I'll take care of you\"  and she meant it, she didn't miss a beat.  I wish I got her name, she was the coolest.  She had brown/reddish hair up in a bun, We both had the Hard Rock Club sandwich and it was great.  She turned the whole experience around for us because we were just about to leave seconds before she came to us.  The other annoyance was this skinny black bald guy who was playing up the whole \"bro\" thing too thick to his coworkers and cussing every time he passed us by.  Fuckin fuckin fuck bro fuck fuck bro is all we heard from him. A for our waitress, hugz to you."}
{"text":"The staff could care less if you need anything and is more interested in standing around talking.  Half the food was overcooked and half was cold."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent...planned on eating and Denny's but wait was too long never expected the breakfast would be so good very impressed.. 5 stars to you Hard Rock Cafe.."}
{"text":"Lovely Bartender.  The shirt salesman gave us great advice about the city."}
{"text":"Well it was a little over priced but for a metalhead it's like candyland. You get to see the guitars of Steve Vai, Van Helen,Steve Howe,Paul Stanley and so many more. And the bartender was one of coolest guy ever. Travis, you are pretty awesome. As it was our first time in Vegas and we asked him to  let us know about some place where we can pick up girls. And he wrote down 3-4 clubs for us. And even gave us complimentary drinks. Thumbs up for Travis.  Though one thing i didn't understand, Why the hell there was a Britney Spears' mannequin in the hardrock cafe ??  Regards from Badass Beard Brothers from India. \m/"}
{"text":"Wenn man auf der Außenterrasse sitzt, bekommt man beim Essen auch noch richtig viel vom Ambiente auf dem Strip mit!  Tolles uns sehr gutes Essen! Zwar nicht günstig, aber trotzdem jeden $ wert!  Unbedingt einen der leckeren Cocktails probieren!"}
{"text":"If you have travelled to many cities the Hard Rock Cafe may be a place you would like to check out and the Las Vegas version is no exception. Its got plenty of music memoribilia with a number of instruments hanging and displayed on the walls . The breakfast is massive and if you like american diners this is the place for a hearty start to the day."}
{"text":"Called today to make reservations for July 4th and was told I will have to do that online.....so I asked for the manager to explain this to me. The manager never got on the phone....just the young lady once more told to tell me the same thing. NOW....my party of 7 will be having dinner at the Grand Concourse.   1. If you are a manager of a restaurant and someone asks for your time in person or the phone, you give it. End of story, absolute turnoff. I will NEVER eat at this place due to the lack of respect for a diner.  2. In no way do I believe that the Hard Rock does not take reservations over the phone!   Did not even eat at this place and I know it's not worth my time."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Deniece did a great job taking care of my girlfriend and myself on our anniversary. The food was great and of I had a complaint it would be that there weren't more people at the hard rock to join in the fun!"}
{"text":"Over priced. Horribly cooked burger. Bad layout of the main floor. You want a better burger? Go to the Tilted Kilt a block away. Better layout and timely service? Go to Arrogant Butcher. Restaurant closed at 10pm in the city! It has a bar! The drinks were decent...but nothing to make me stay there. Much better places to go within walking distance for the price."}
{"text":"Had an excellent lunch today. Spotless and good atmosphere. Food was terrific and Mallory couldn't have been better. My best Hard Rock visit among many locations!"}
{"text":"Great service. The Local Legend was tasty and filled me up. Poplano pepper, pico, fried onion strips and a thick burger! The tomatillo sauce on the side was ok but not really my thing for a burger.  Good location after a trip to US Airways Center across the street."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great!  Loved the memorabilia and the music.  Also bought something in the gift shop.  The dinner was good.  Like the potato skins and the burgers were all cooked the way we liked them.  I enjoyed my Haystack Chicken Salad, except when they first brought it out, they forgot the chicken.  I had to wait a little longer for them to put some chicken into the salad.  So we all joked about it, even with the waiter who was really cool.  Overall a fun experience and exactly what I would expect from the Hard Rock Cafe!"}
{"text":"I have to say much better than before, not sure what happend but it worked for us.   1. Food was killer, had a burger and it was done up right.  2. Ice-T was good for once at a place in VEGAS!   3. Staff was cool to me and my son, asked him what music video he would like to see and they played it all over the place.  4. Only reason we didn't give a 5 was at the end the server asked me if it was cool if he gave my son a milkshake, I advised cool deal thats nice of you.  Then it showed up on the bill.  If you are going to try that hard to sell a 3$ shake then why not just say hey a shake comes with his meal for $3 more are you interested, I would have bought it.   I am not stressing on it, just mentioning that he made it sound like he wanted to hook the little guy up, at the end my kid was like DAD that guy was nice to buy me a shake, I just let it ride.   Would come back again, hell that burger sounds good right now."}
{"text":"1st time at this establishment.  Service was great. Had the appetizer combo with the wings, bruschetta, chicken tenders, onion rings and southwest egg rolls. The wings were super delicious as were the onion rings. The tenders were a tad dry but tasty. The egg rolls are tiny but ok. The mai-tai was nice and strong. I got it in a souvenir glass so that I could have more. At the end I was given an unopened glass for the road. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I honestly was not expecting much coming here, just a typical burger place. Our wait time was about 5 min and we got the best server ever! Thanks for the great service Amy!!  I got the tangy wings and omg I wanted to lick the plate they were so good!! My husband got a burger that he said was good not great."}
{"text":"We liked looking at all the music memorabilia but we were not fans of their nachos. It was the bean and sauce mixture. In the future if I wind up at another HRC I will order them with out the beans and sauce because the rest of it was decent. This location was at the Station Square that overlooked the river and downtown Pittsburgh. It was a good location for sitting on the patio and watching a water show that played with the music. Our server wasn't busy so she was overly attentive - to the point of seriously annoying. Overall, it was ok and not a terrible experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I were supposed to dine here this afternoon today until one female staff member ruined the whole day for us.  She was rude and  unprofessional ! She smiled at us sarcastically and slammed our food platter right in front us, all because I had asked her if our drinks where on the way as I was extremely thirsty, she gave me a dirty look and mumbled something which I couldn't quite understand. I noticed she was talking about me with her colleagues. She kept touching the straws on our drinks whilst she brought them to us!   At that point I had lost it decided I had had enough so i insisted to speak to the manager right away. Manager didn't do much. I was disgusted. We ended up leaving right away without even eating there as we were so upset and disappointed with the service. It's a shame as we had always enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe there but not this particular day. we will never go there again!  This female waitress should be fired or sent of with a warning! It's people like her who give a place a bad name! Shameful! I mean if somebody is not content at a job place just leave or make space for somebody else who enjoys doing it! After all if it isn't for us the paying customers, she wouldn't have a job to go too!"}
{"text":"I have visited loads of different Hard Rock Cafes, but this one has to be the best. It is connected to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.    My boyfriend and i popped in one day for lunch, and we both loved it.    The restaurant is filled with music memorabilia, and has instruments on display.    The staffs were extremely helpful, and definitely went above and beyond to make sure you had a great lunch. The food was delicious, but the portions were massive, i left quite a bit because i just couldn't fit it in.    Hard Rock is located just off the strip, but is very easy to get too. We took a taxi, but i'm sure you could walk it."}
{"text":"Super nette Bedienung, haben dort etwas getrunken, liegt an einem sehr belebten Platz, ist immer was los, Preise natürlich entsprechend (Bier 6,00 und Glas Prosecco 9,00 Dollar Can). Schön Abends im Außenbereich zu sitzen und dem Treiben zuzuschauen."}
{"text":"Bad for even for a hard rock, not as impressive as other Hard Rocks in terms of atmosphere but food is predictably similar.  Service was slow and the order for a table of eight came out in waves over 5 minutes kind of disappointing.  But maybe it is because I dislike theme restaurants but anyway you don't have many choices for groups in the area and this had seating for 8 so it goes.  One big plus was they gave each person individual bills, and they suggested it so that was a great favor."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5. We were seated and no one came to our table after that for 20 minutes. Not even to take our drink order.  We left without ordering anything and let the hostess know that we were completely forgotten. We were pretty bummed because we were excited all day to eat there.  The store part was nice and the employees were very helpful there."}
{"text":"Excellent Service! Patrick was our waiter and he was the best!! Will be coming back and will make sure to ask for Patrick when we do"}
{"text":"The Hard Rock Cafe is a Greta place to have a meal or just drinks. We stopped on at the end if the night for a few drinks. The staff was very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"so we went here on a deal we heard of and a recommendation from a friend. I am so glad we did. My friend got a burger and said it was delicious. I got the cajun prawn pear salad and it was AMAZING!! We also sipped on some delicious mojitos.  Our waitress was patient, friendly, and helpful. I will be back the next time I am in vegas for sure.  It has been a long time since I had been in a Hard Rock and it was fun to see all the memorabilia.   This is must do for some food on the strip.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"LOCATION:  Downtown Phoenix - walking distance from the stadiums!   ATMOSPHERE:  Very lively with great energy for a Saturday afternoon!  There were several flat screen TVs with music videos playing...not too loud.  A couple of other screens along the wall had the local March Madness basketball games playing.  We were there three hours before the Lady Gaga concert, and the other patrons were fun and diverse!    FOOD:  We had the \"Big Cheese Burger\" and \"Grilled Veggie Sandwich.\"  For drinks, we were excited to have a \"Bahama Mama\" and \"Blackberry Smash!\"  I was sad when I found out they were out of the Balsamic Tomato Bruschetta.  We ate every bite!!  There was not a crumb remaining!  VERY GOOD!  PARKING:  There is a parking garage just a couple of blocks away.  We were staying at a hotel which included parking in the garage; therefore, I'm not sure of the garage rates.  I would recommend parking there when in the area.      PERKS:  Location, location, location!  SERVICE:  The waitress was friendly and very efficient.  Even though it was getting busier each minute we were there, she was very responsive to our table!  VERY happy!  CONCLUSION:  For event nights, DEFINITELY get there at 5 pm.  If you wait until 6 pm or later, it will be quite crowded.  The location alone makes this place perfect for dinner and drinks before attending games/concerts.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wir waren mit einer großen Gruppe da (ca. 500+)  Vom Platz war da immernoch einiges möglich und das Ambiente ist über alles erhaben. Der Service könnte besser sein. Beim Abendbüffet waren keine Mitarbeiter in unserem Bereich, nur an der Bar oder im Restaurant. So waren auch nachträglich Fragen zum Essen (Saucen usw.) nicht möglich daher Punktabzug. Das Essen war dafür wiederum vielfältig und auch nicht zu teuer. Besonders Empfehlenswert Abends durch die Tarasse hat man einen schönen Ausblick auf den Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we ended up deciding on a tourist geared chain, but we decided to go here one of the nights while in Toronto.  The food was \"ok\", but I expect better than than that for $20+ entrees.  The ambiance was not as good as I have seen at other Hard Rocks.  The waiter did the basics of his job, but was not very attentive or friendly.  Overall - not horrible, but certainly not a value."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre...after asking about the stained glasses and being told it was water stains. Then my order was wrong,  and the server suggested I'm better off taking the onions off myself.  No thanks...new order please.  Not very impressed..."}
{"text":"Ordered a $12 Chicken Wings plate and waitress took my card and charged me $63.74! While they apologized and said the money would be reversed in 48 hours or so.... I am still upset that I was charged $63.74, then charged the $12.XX for my wings.... So an extra $63.74 that I had planned on spending at the arena for souvenirs at the concert I was attending was not available to me because the mistake of a waitress. I understand how busy it was and it was a mistake, but a simple mistake can surely put a damper on ones evening. I'll sit at home and watch my bank account to see when this $63.74  will magically appear. Disappointed and frustration  doesn't even begin to explain the way this affected my evening after we left your establishment."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE place, food was absolutely disgusting. Greasy burger for like 15 dollars. I definitely said why did I eat here in my head after I left"}
{"text":"Made the obligatory stop here while in Vegas so my wife could get a t-shirt. We each had a spicy burger with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and chipotle mayo. They were pretty tasty but very greasy and messy. My onion rings were burnt. Not a particularly good combination for $16 each. (yikes)  The server was friendly and attentive. I'm a big music buff so the atmosphere is great with all the memorabilia and videos playing."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and the environment is nice. What is the problem then? Ate there yesterday and today 2 from my party is sick Including myself. We both ate the NY strip steak."}
{"text":"There is only one thing so say about this.    IT'S A HARD ROCK CAFE ... there is no more to say....."}
{"text":"The set-up of the new restaurant is very cool with balconies and fantastic Strip views.  It was way too cold to sit outside when we were there, but I can see giving it a go in April or May, or perhaps on a summer evening.    Everything else seemed to be the same as all the other HRC's.  The food rarely disappoints.  On this particular occasion, DH and I shared the appetizer sampler platter.  The emphasis on trying to sell merchandise to diners is a little annoying - and half the specialty drinks seem to be an automatic \"pay extra to keep the glass\" deal.   Not wanting to schlep a glass on the airplane, I selected one of the other drinks and it was disappointingly weak, yet expensive.  Should've just avoided the specialty menu and ordered some standard thing.  As for the music, it should've been called \"The Generally Fairly Mellow Rock Cafe\" - to us, a bit of a disappointment.  Maybe it's more rockin' late at night if the one in Tahoe is any guide."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The server was rude, slamming our drinks on the table, throwing the straws on the top and walking away without a second glance. He spilled an entire pitcher of water on my lap because he was just not paying attention. The chicken fingers have a gross chili seasoning to them that they don't explain in the menu. I had to ask for the manager because our server was taking so long to get our check after explaining we were in a rush. Our meal ended up being $30 even after we asked to return the food and only shared a salad. I expected the Hard Rock Cafe experience that I have always talked so highly of and now this company has lost my business."}
{"text":"this is the absolute worst service that I have ever experienced. our waitress was everywhere. at this rate, I'm surprised they even have customers. I came here with several co workers. service was so bad that we ended up asking for boxes as our meals came out. when she brought out our to go boxes, she didn't bring enough. I went and got the rest of our to go boxes. our waters/drinks never got refilled. on top of that, the waitress took so long to bring out our drinks, that she brought it out in a to go cup. I will never be back again. get your act together, hard rock!"}
{"text":"The service was great-our waiter was super friendly. It is a hard-rock cafe. The ambience was fair and the food was pretty good. It wasn't anything that exciting, but is a great place to take a group in Vegas for a fun time."}
{"text":"We were greeted promptly and our picture taken . We were seated outside on the Patio , the waiter was having a great time with the table next to us . Then another couple came in and was seated . Waitress came over promptly and took there order . We waited 15 mins and no service! We left , we figure business must be pretty good that they let one get away ! Great disappointment !"}
{"text":"Our first waitress (Elena) seemed upset that we wanted to move from outside to inside.  She hesitated and didn't seem accommodating when getting us inside.  When I ordered water she rolled her eyes.  When I ordered an appetizer she rolled her eyes again. She was short with her answers and never once was friendly...no smiles...no thank you... nothing.  Very rude....almost left because she made us feel so uncomfortable.  No sure if she was in a bad mood or something.  Our second waitresse (gigi) was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for brunch while we waited to check in to our hotel. The host told us to sit wherever we wanted, so we sat at a table by the bar. We were ignored by all staff for ten minutes. A waitress walked by us twice and never said a word. We decided to sit closer to other folks (no one else was sitting in our area). After we left the table, a waiter came by and re-arranged the silverware we moved. Didn't want to tell us we were sitting in the wrong area but how dare we mess up the table. Then he came to our new table to give us menus. He became our waiter at the new table. I made a comment to him about sitting in the wrong area before and he ignored it. Food arrived in a decent amount of time. However, my mother and I ordered the same vegetarian omelet and hers had almost no vegetables in it. I will never eat here again because the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Location: Right across the street from the Suns' arena and Diamondbacks' ballpark. It's probably the location that draws most people into the Hard Rock.  Ambiance: Sat outside during the evening in the summer. Fairly quiet and cool, even though it had been in the upper 90s earlier in the day.  Waitstaff: Amazing! The waiter was very attentive, but not overbearing. Food came out in around ten minutes.   Food: Got a burger, which was perfectly cooked, and fries that were seasoned nicely.   Overall: The Hard Rock is a great place to go, even though it's a little pricey for what you get. The fact of the matter is that there just aren't many other decent places to eat in the downtown area when you want something quick and easy. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband usually has the ribs but this time very disappointed.  The ribs were very burnt and served anyway.  My salmon was tasty but it was not very eye appealing on a blackened piece of what I think was bamboo?  Server brought our drinks without a tray basically hugging the glasses to his chest.  Wine glass very streaked looking probably just water smears.  Will think twice before revisiting."}
{"text":"Dropped in on Valentine's night after the Fluffy comedy show. Although it was 10:30pm, the staff saw the crowd and cranked everything back up. Didn't mind the 10 minute wait and the staff was extra friendly. Wait staff very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food. I had chicken tenders and their coating was unique but good. The best part was the dipping sauce. Wife had shrimp and replaced side with broccoli (they were out of mashed potatoes). The food was seasoned and cooked well but the shrimp was a bit greasy. Prices are what you expect at this type of restaurant/attraction. The place is clean but they really need to fix their chairs and tables. Tables wobbled all through meal. I tried to put napkins under one leg to help balance it out. The chairs are weak and leave you feeling a bit unsafe as well. Best thing about the night was my company, the staff, and the food in that order.  Yes I would come back. Hope I can enjoy the place without playing handyman."}
{"text":"Locale giusto per bere qualcosa dopo cena, tranquillo anche con la piazza piena per concerti. È ok!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.......the decor was great.....our server Gretchen was awesome.she sat down with us chatted ..she was fast ...music was good..food was great not a long wait food was hot and freshly made. I had the twisted mac and cheese it was sooooooo good. Hubby had the chicken Marsala he loved it :) We returned a few days later for lunch caused we liked it so much :) I would recommed this place and prices where very reasonable ."}
{"text":"Tja, kennst du ein HRC kennst du sie alle, sollte man meinen. Aber das hier in Vegas war irgendwie anders. Die Präsenz der dort ausgestellten Sänger war mir noch nie so allgegenwärtig. Das lag nicht nur an den Memorabilia von Curt Cobain, für mich unvergessen.    Die Speisen und Getränke sind wahrhaftig wie in jedem HRC auf der Welt, braucht man glaube ich kein Wort darüber zu verlieren.    Wer noch Kohle hat kann im HRC Casino noch ein Spielchen wagen.    Ich komme wieder, keine Frage!"}
{"text":"Every single time we visit Toronto we hit up this place for all I can drink purple haze's and a giant table full of appetizers. Again, awesome night out, we always make a point of not rushing at this place, I mean, aside from the wicked memorabilia, the staff is always great,  the haystack salad is so good and no I am not a person that just eats salads when she goes out for dinner (read the rest of my reviews) but seriously, pay the extra for the cool glasses and enjoy the night!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and drinks. We were in for an early lunch (late breakfast) and staff was very slow and not very helpful."}
{"text":"Terrible service took forever and when the food came the chicken sandwich was rubbery"}
{"text":"Everyone was super nice from the hostesses to the server! Food was great. They have an outdoor patio with a view of the strip great to people watch. The margaritas were kind of expensive at nearly $10 a drink but they are strong so well worth it."}
{"text":"If you're healthy food conscious and like a less institutionalized ambiance this is not the place for you. My son and I ordered and split the vegie burger and the salmon. The best part of dinner was the glass of red wine, and the salmon was ok.  Ok for American hamburgers and steaks I guess. We didn't try them. Our waitress was really attentive and sweet, and helped to salvage our dining experience. Oh, and the food was ready rather quickly. I'd recommend that there be a few fresh spring greens and arugala on the menu for us grass eaters."}
{"text":"Burger was kind of  ok but not special but totally overpriced.   The Service was lame and not really friendly.   Location at the Las Vegas Strip, the balcony outside was nice.    I would not go there again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few days ago with my sister at around 2:30pm and it was not busy. We agreed to be seated on the patio but was seated at a booth. We the told our waitress and she accommodated us to the patio. The patio gives a nice view of the strip, but it was hard to get in your seats. It took the waitress 15 minutes to order our drinks. It took her another 15 minutes to bring out mines but not my sister's. She placed my drink down, apologized, said she will be right back and hurried off to bring another person their drink. After 20 minutes of waiting and our waitress no where in sight we asked another waitress about our drink. We waited another 10 minutes for my sister's drinks bringing it a total of 1 hour without ordering food. At this time I was very frustrated at the service. When the waitress came back with the drinks, I asked for the bill. She was right back with the bill with in 5 minutes. The drinks were good. The Hard Rocking Mai Tai was delicious and strong. The drinks, view of the strip from the patio and still being hung over from an awesome vacation are the only reasons why this place receive a two. I am a naturally a tipper, but since the service was horrible I left $2. Upon walking out the door the waitress said out loud for everyone to hear  \"you left $2, oh well thanks for the tip\"."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a burger and margarita on their outside patio on a lovely early April Las Vegas Day.  Burger was cooked to perfection and the margarita was fantastic!  Service was attentive and friendly.    Would return!"}
{"text":"Na minha opinião, o mais \"atraente\" de todos os Hard Rock. Talvez seja pelo fato de estar na cidade do jogo.... Decoração interessante, local gigante, muitos e muitos ítens (como se fossem de 3 lojas juntas)..."}
{"text":"Love coming to Hard Rock on the strip, we usually get the Legendary Burger which is awesome but they recently added some great dishes to the menu. I was a bit nervous trying something different cause the burgers always hit the spot but our waitress was raving about the new Brisket sandwich, it was absolutely fantastic. It was full of flavor with a small side of baked beans, really good. My wife also tried something different, she got the baby arugula salad which she loved! It was huge with sliced chicken and a nice mixture of veggies. We were very happy that we tried the new items. Just a week ago we dropped in for dinner and had some room for dessert. The staff mentioned that the Banana Split was awesome so we ordered it and WOW! It was delicious! We were not expecting that, the presentation was great! Definitely the best Banana split we have had. To top it off the service at HRC is first class, from hosts, waitresses to servers all the way up to Management, I've interacted with them all and they do a really a good job of providing excellent service. Can't forget the (( MUSIC! )) Always cool watching some throwback music videos and grubbin! Hard Rock Rocks!"}
{"text":"Check your check cause they will make up prices. Food was bad. Service was ok, I guess it's Vegas"}
{"text":"A very nice promoter got us on the strip and told us they just opened up a new lounge with a bar and free drinks. We checked it out and it was pretty cool. It was chill the crowd wasn't too crazy. The only complaint I have was the DJ wasn't that great. I've heard way better mixes than that. I feel that it only became tolerable music because of the free drinks and is just becoming more drunk. Overall it was a fun experience though.  We stayed there all night."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Hard Rock Cafes. But the Texan burger here truly was incredible. I would photographed its magnificence... but I couldn't put it down. Everyone enjoyed their food and the view."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here, and I'm glad my boyfriend chose this place out of 10 restaurants he had to pick for his birthday. Our server, luis, was amazing! He was a hype man, goofy, and talkative. He checked on us every few minutes to see if we're okay.. What was different was that Luis got everyone attention to have the customers say 'Happy birthday' to my boyfriend. Funny and also cool.. Other than that, the food was good and we got seated instantly. I would definitely come here for 'fathers day' because I know my old man would love it here and hope to have Luis as our server again."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend.  After reading rave reviews about the nachos thought I'd give them a try.  Way over price, the meat was all gristle,  totally disgusting and inedible.  The staff seemed very discriminating."}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Portions are huge, so share a plate with a friend! The strawberry lemonade with basil is so amazing! It's pricey, but totally worth it. Service here is great too. When you are looking for a great meal, decent price, and fun atmosphere, this restaurant really delivers. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Don't pass up the Mac &a Cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now. It was SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Just so so. Upcharged $3.50 for 6 onion rings instead of fries. Server was attentive. Just ok food, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great service, food came out fast and everything was tasty. My honey enjoyed his birthday steak and apple cobbler w/ ice cream -- that's all that matters. :-)  It was a Sunday and we were seated quickly. This is the only Hard Rock Cafe we have experienced therefore, we have no other comparisons. We will check out the others if given a chance, I am hoping the menu changes to reflect the local taste buds. Parking was the only challenge."}
{"text":"We came for dessert, and we're very disappointed. I got a milkshake, and it was just milk with whipped cream. We waited so long, my ice cream (if there was any) had melted. The waitress brought me a spoon, but for what? Fortunately, there was an extra straw on the table, or I would still be waiting for her to come back. Our waitress was HORRIBLE. She didn't check on us once the whole time we were there. My dining partners said their ice cream was melted, and the fudge in one dessert was a solid mass; the apple dessert was cold and practically ineatible. Of course, our waitress was too busy singing and dancing to notice, or even ask how our meal went. This was my first time at Hard Rock. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was great!  The coffee was great!  The service was slow, and inatentive..."}
{"text":"Went here to see memorabilias and to visit the Rock Shop.....they've got cool Hard Rock gear - I ended up shopping for my Christmas list here."}
{"text":"This is only my second time at this location. The last time was close to 20 years ago so you know it's a whole different place.   I wasn't overly impressed with it then, and I wasn't overly impressed this time either.   The service was very good. Waiter was attentive and mostly prompt (withy the exception of bringing our bills).  One of my biggest pet peaves is when a bar screws up an order of wings. I ordered baked medium and the came out sloppy and undercooked. I left 3 on the plate. Not a good experience.   The thing I was impressed with was the music and videos. We were there because we were heading to Massey Hall for a Dream Theater show. Low and behold - HRC was in the know because they prepared us for the night by playing several of their music videos. Nice touch.   I'd go back for a drink, but prob not for dinner."}
{"text":"We are in Vegas for the first time and naturally, we wanted to eat at Hard Rock Cafe. We  signed in OK, when our pager light up, we went up to the hostess stand expecting to be seated.  No, that was just to tell us to stand in a different spot. I have a hard time standing so I had given up my seat while waiting, If we knew we had to wait again, I would have stayed where I was!! Then we passed up several empty tables and booths to be seated in the back by the kitchen.  They then took forever before our waiter came over and another 30 minutes to get our sodas and lemonade. Then it was an hour before we got our food.  At one point, our waiter did come over and we were talking to him and the people at the next table called him and he turned around and waited on them.  We were mid sentence and he left us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was so incredibly rude!!!!  Then when the other table left and they were cleaning off the table, the busboy stacked the glasses so high that the bottom glass shattered from the pressure.  There was glass all over and they only cleaned up part of it, my husband was trying to point out more glass and they obviously DID NOT like it being pointed out.  So he got up to go find the manager and told him what all was going on. He did come by our table for about 2 seconds and said he would go check on our food. That obviously upset the kitchen.  One son ordered a BBQ bacon burger and it was so dry and bland (no BBQ sauce on it and burger itself was dry and flavorless) that he could not eat.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it also was dry! I only ate about a quarter of it. My other son is usually ravenous and eats anything. I gave him half of my sandwich and he only took 1 bite and said no thanks.  Anyway, that gives you an idea of what we thought of the food.  And the table with the broken glass, well we kept pointing out where more glass was and they finally finished cleaning BUT there was still more broken glass under the table.  I hope that whoever sits at that table with sandals on and cuts there foot sees this so they know it was pure negligence on the part of the restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here! Wonderful experience. Seated immediately on a Saturday afternoon.  Waitress very attentive. We ordered the Hickory Smoked BBQ combo with ribs and pulled pork. Ribs were tender and flavorful. Pork was nice and tender as well. Comes with a small side of coleslaw , which was just ok. Baked beans tasted more like chili that should go on a chili dog , but they were ok. Also had the margarita flight( 3 mini margaritas) that came with chips and salsa. Excellent!! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE.   I'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and the food is superb..  The breaded chicken, and macaroni are out of this world!!  You can't beat the views while you're eating there either."}
{"text":"I've been to the Toronto Hard Rock a few times over the years and, sadly, the service has only gotten worse.  The food is pretty mediocre and is often slow to arrive.  We were there recently during the first Saturday of Filmfest and the place was not at all busy and yet we sat for fifteen minutes without even being greeted by a server - we left and ate somewhere else this time.  I think that was their last chance;  probably won't be trying that location again.  That said, their Hard Rock in Niagara Falls was a better experience."}
{"text":"Bathrooms were small, drinks expensive as hell, not enough open space for moving around (you're always trying to squeeze through something), and the bartenders can't put more than one shot in your drinks."}
{"text":"I'd give it half a star if I could, and that would be for the atmosphere.  We had a party of 11 (including 3 kids), on a Sunday afternoon.  So they weren't very busy.  Our server was polite, but after ordering it took an hour to get our food.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  The first bite was all fat, turned out the entire sandwich was all fat, and inedible.  My father in law order chicken nachos, no tomatoes (he can't eat them).  They came covered with tomatoes so he sent them back for the beef nachos, again stated no tomatoes to the same server.  When he finally got them, surprise, more tomatoes.  Combine that with messed up orders and undercooked burgers for the rest of our party, and we were pretty unhappy.  The server brought over the manager, Tim or Ted or something (medium build white guy with a shaved head).  At the table he was all \"right, of course, of course, I understand.\". And offered us deserts on the houseto make up ffor the issues, so we ordered desert to try and salvage the experience.  He also promised to take the messed up items off the menu.  When we got the bill we found out they had charged us for everything, including the complimentary deserts, and took a flat $100 off the bill (original total of about $250).  When I confronted the manager one on one about the bill (the deserts we were charged for, and the flat $100,taken off), he became confrontational and said it wasn't his job to go through the check item by item and take things off.  When I offered to sit down with him and do it for him, he said \"if you want to go through item by item and argue over 14 cents, that's up to you.\". He then assured me there was no one above him to speak to and walked off.  We paid our bill because we are not the type to walk out on a check, and our server got a $10 pitty tip.  I will never go back there, especially with guests from out of town, and I will never recommend it to anyone.  Please save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends because we were going to a concert there (Metal Elvis, meh). We weren't expecting much but were seduced by the convenience of eating at the same place as the show.  The first problem was that one person in our group made a reservation online, but they had no record of it when we got there, despite our having a confirmation number. So, we had to wait for a table.  The next problem is that the Mint Julep I had was probably 90% simple syrup. Truly an awful cocktail (not to mention that the waitress had no idea what kind of bourbon they had).  The service was slow. Some manager type came by and gave us some kind of locals only frequent member card. Not enough for everyone, mind you. Which was fine by me because I hate that kind of crap. Don't need another card to carry around.  The group shared a plate of nachos which were OK. Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.  The special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger. Came with a salad but most of the \"vegetables\" were white, so that was a disappointment, let me tell you.  Went in suspecting that the Hard Rock Cafe is nothing more than a tourist trap and everything about it confirmed this suspicion."}
{"text":"On par food wise with other hard rock locations. Really nice to find some patio seating right on the strip! We were there for breakfast and the prices were much more reasonable than I expected, $12 or so per meal. Don't know that I would go again, now that I've been, but an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I have never been to the Hard Rock Cafe before so I personally enjoyed the decor. Our waiter was hilarious and I loved my Granny Smith burger. The portions were big and I had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Worst pulled pork sandwich ever.  Had to ask for extra BBQ sauce, but still didn't kill the taste.  Slow service as well.  No reason to return."}
{"text":"Well I cannot say that I would recommend this place to anyone. The waiter we had was really rude and did not smile once. He put our drinks and food down on the table not even looking at the table or us. He didn't even try to hide he fact that he acted like he hated his life and would rather be anywhere else. Not only was it him but none of the employees acted happy. And it's not like the food made up for any of it all. The food tasted like it could have came from a fast food restaurant. I was cold inside wearing  a jacket and it was over 100 degrees outside. the only highlight of my whole visit was the music. sigh"}
{"text":"I love the Hard Rock Cafe. Doesn't matter what town, the theming is great. I also am a big fan of their fajitas. Contrary to what some say, the food is pretty good, only drawback is that it is pretty expensive. Overall a great place right near the Station Square part of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"really good food ! jim and his friend who he was training where the best. thank you!"}
{"text":"Und doch sind die hrc's nicht alle gleich, dieser hatte es mir besonders angetan. Einer meiner big big hrc. Favorits"}
{"text":"Geez what to say about this place, Big love to the way it looks. Has a the WOW factor for sure, yes is a tourist place, but its the Hard Rock what do you expect. It has the clothes/retail store on the ground level and if you go up the stairs you have the cafe.   I love Hard Rock stuff, T-shirts, mugs, key rings ect...The clothes and retail items aren't really that expensive, BUT go upstairs and be prepared.  I got a Sandwich and coke and my wife got chicken strips and fries with an ice T. lets just say filling up the Envoy was cheaper.  If it's just to shop around this place is GREAT, as for food shoot over the road!! you'll love it there.  Cheers  GO HERE (not for the food though)"}
{"text":"Great decor, music, and souvenirs (albeit a bit pricey). The quality of the food was a pleasant surprise. I had a side salad (house) and a the twisted macaroni, chicken, and cheese. In addition to the side of garlic bread, the portions were fairly big. The mac and cheese was likely fried, giving it an interesting taste. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place it a dump!! IT IS A COMPLETE TOURIST TRAP! Stay away!!!!! Firstly, the place is not clean!! From the washrooms, to the table tops, to the floor!!! We sat on the patio and there were pigeons walking around on the floor, under our chairs and tables!! The food dropped on the floor by diners is left on the ground for pigeons! Our plates for our appetizers were wet!!! Secondly, the service was crap! Our waiter was nice but over talkative and a bit pushy! We ordered two drinks..one tasted so bad that it wasn't even touched!! The waiter did not care to wave it off the bill. Thirdly, the food was gross! The nachos were the worst I've had and tasted stale even though they seemed popular!! (Everyone around us was having them). Out of the 3-4 Hard Rock Cafes I've been to this was the worst!! Avoid it!!"}
{"text":"Dieses Cafe ist direkt neben dem Hard Rock Hotel nur einen Steinwurf vom Hofbräuhaus entfernt gelegen. Noch vor dem Eintreten wird man mit passender Musik empfangen, die Musik im innern war nicht zu laut aber auch nichts für empfindliche Ohren.    Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich und um unser Wohl bemüht, sämtliche Bestellungen wurden problemlos und schnell aufgetafelt.    Zum Abschluss sollte man sich den obligatorischen Gang durch den Shop nicht nehmen lassen. Dieses Cafe ist definitiv einen Besuch wert!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hard Rock Cafe, we have been to several national and international locations but I have to say this was our worst experience! Hard to believe since is Vegas but it is true. We ask for chicken nachos they gave us beef and the server didn't even came once to check if everything was ok. We waited 15 minutes without drinks, the server offer to bring us more drinks after I stare her for like 5 minutes and she shouted from the bar if we wanted anything else. And right there I just lost it! So I just ask for water. We came only for drinks and appetizers but with that costumer service we only have one round of drinks. And to finish our experience, bathrooms were dirty. Smell bad, toilet paper everywhere. I mean this place is not cheap and we are ok to pay as long as it's worth it. This place needs some love."}
{"text":"On se sent toujours un peu petit quand on est face à une guitare de 12 mètres de haut. Très très bonne musique, et public au rendez-vous."}
{"text":"There is a giant neon guitar near the building so you can't miss it.  The Cafe is inside the Tower City.  It's been a long time sine I've been to any Hard Rock Cafe so I kind of forgot how nice they are.  Although this one seems particularly nice. It may be because they are close to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  My husband and I were there during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame doing honor to Chuck Berry.  It was a good time to be there.  We wanted to eat lightly so we could walk around a lot.  He had a French Dip and I had delicious chicken noodle soup along with Twisted Macaroni.  The food was great and didn't weigh us down. What was really nice though, is that our waitress suggested we take a walk around the restaurant, including going downstairs.  We found wonderful photos on the walls.  We got a kick out of Mick Jagger's poster and of Belushi's as they were both giving the \"bird\" to the camera.  I have to say it was relaxing, clean, timely and generally very pleasant. If I'm in town, I would definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Super mit den Eingang,der Riesen Gitarre. Abends total genial."}
{"text":"A minor inconvenience dealt swiftly by Cameron then an awesome bar experience by Christian.   The mark of great customer service.   Everyone, come here!  Thanks, Marty"}
{"text":"I will give Hard Rock Cafe an extra star for responding to reviews, which (at least the way I see it) means that they care what their guests think about the food and service.  Hard Rock Cafe has a well-advertised atmosphere, so if you go there expecting something different, then you deserve to be disappointed (see reviews regarding wedding groups, of which we were one).  A little noisy, but again, expected.  We had burgers and sides, which were all good.  Service was good.  Parking is easy (short walk).  My actual rating is 4.5 stars, 1/2 star off for automatic tip (we had a large party). I understand why they do it, but a tip is payment for excellent service.  Mandatory tip is just extra cost."}
{"text":"They need to rename this place \"crappy r&b/pop/techno music played way too loud cafe\" There is no HARD ROCK being played.  Not even Bon Jovi or Def Leppard."}
{"text":"friendly staff and good food. the live music was a little bit to loud. the band was ok. but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints - usually go before a Phoenix Mercury game.  Like their mac and cheese ! A little it expensive, but it is good."}
{"text":"The drinks are good but the service is way too bad. The bartender are rude and show an attitude without caring for your drink. I would give 5 start for food, but the service without attention is no good for the restaurant. The bartender name was Katie."}
{"text":"Jesus H Christ is it loud in there. we got there and had to wait to be seated, although it wasnt that full    anyway waiters are really friendly and are always readily available to order As all hard rock cafes they have a wide choice of apetizers and main meals!    But its so fricking loud. The music is blasting to the maximum even at 12 pm I couldnt wait to get out...    The decoration is typical 'hard rock' material. The bill is exactly what ud expect from a hard rock cafe, around 20$/person    If you are intending on buying something from the store tho, keep your cafe receipt you might get a small discount."}
{"text":"Gestern waren wir im Hard Rock Cafe direkt am Las Vegas Boulevard, um eine Mahlzeit zu uns zu nehmen. Nach den knapp 40 Grad Celsius, die draussen herrschten, war der klimatisierte Innenbereich wie ein kleiner Himmel für uns. Der Kellner war zwar freundlich, machte aber den Eindruck, dass alles schnell gehen muss, damit die Plätze zügig an die nachkommenden Gäste weitervergeben werden können. Dieser Eindruck bestätigte sich, als er uns fragte ob wir noch etwas wünschen, wir nach der Rechnung verlangten, und er die Rechnung schon fertig dabei hatte. Von der Atmosphäre her ist das Restaurant typisch Hard Rock Cafe: Laute Rockmusik, Star-Memorabilia an den Wänden und die typische Karte, die aus Burgern, Steaks und den üblichen Vorspeisen besteht. Man weiß halt, was man bekommt, wenn man ins Hard Rock Cafe geht. Während meine Frau den 'Honey Citrus Grilled Chicken Salat' bestellt hatte, habe ich mir die 'Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs' mit Pommes, Krautsalat und einem Bohnendip gegönnt. Beide Gerichte schmeckten hervorragend, leider waren die Rippchen nur lauwarm. Dafür war das Fleisch aber so zart, dass man es mit der Zunge zerdrücken konnte. Zum Essen hatten wir noch ein 'Shock Top', eine amerikanische Biersorte, die ein belgisches Bier darstellen soll. War ganz ok, hatten uns aber ein wenig mehr davon versprochen. Preistechnisch ist es im Hard Rock Cafe natürlich nicht ganz billig, mit der Rechnung bekamen wir allerdings einen 20%-Rabatt-Gutschein für den Shop und da wir da sowieso einkaufen wollten haben wir noch nebenbei 6$ gespart."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food was deelish, and had the most amazing server. Tim Mccamish. Hilarious guy! Made sure we were well taken care of. Gotta get this guy a raise! Great energy and an even greater moustache."}
{"text":"I recently popped into the new Hard Rock Cafe on the strip to see musical talents The Reverend Horton Heat and Nashville Pussy and I was decently pleased with the venue.  For starters, the sound was better than other Hard Rock locations that I've been to and the layout of the place was  spacious and inviting, allowing a patron to see everything everywhere, no matter what room one might be standing in.  They had some very cool memorabilia on the walls, just as we've all come to expect of the Hard Rock, except this time it appears that they put a lot more thought into the color schemes than what I've seen before. The bar had a great selection and surprisingly reasonable prices - considering its high profile location - and that was pretty much the icing on the cake for ensuring my return."}
{"text":"Tolle Burger. Den besten Burger denich je gegessen habe. Mit in Honig angebratenem Speck. Die Preise sind natürlich etwas angehoben. Nettes Ambiente. Ein muß für jeden Urlauber"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast mimosas! Love the view and most of all the breakfast. It's so memorable to me not only because of the wonderful atmosphere but also because me fiancé proposed here"}
{"text":"Good breakfast and dinner, customer service was great, I had left my reading glasses, and they found them and held them for me to pick up."}
{"text":"a good place to have a couple of beers,but basically is just another HRC,nothing special about it."}
{"text":"First time to hard rock cafe in vegas.  I had 10oz of lengendary burger.  It was awesome, I skipped breakfest n lunch next day til 4 pm, i was still stuffed from that lengendary burger. Pricey, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Walked in last night to grab a some food and a drink before seeing a show at Comerica. We were in a hurry tonsee a show so we sat at the bar and were greeted by Shelley who immediately without even looking at us stated no alcohol food only. Both me and my date were sober. We didn't argue just ordered our food and quickly left. The promotional gift cards we were unsing supposedly didn't work. But she did go in the back and get some that did. She was rude, curt and generally unfriendly. I dunno what made her think we were intoxicated. She didn't even turn around and look at us before denying us alcohol. We are in our mid 30's middle class normal parents out for a night without the kids. Will not be returning. No wonder they hand out the promotional gift cards like they are nothing."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday, and had a great hot dog meal. Today, at first I went to Houlihan's, looked at their terrible \"design\" and small menu, and decided to come back. This is just the introduction. Nothing much intended here.  We were seated immediately. No wait at all. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, in which it was a little cool, but aside from that the records and album covers and fancy electric guitars were really cool. Of course, to every good thing a bad. The walls were bricks, and I'm sorry but I just don't like bricks.  Then we hit a slope. At first, our waitress was really nice and didn't take any time at all to take our drinks and orders. Then, we didn't see her for 10 minutes at least. She walked around us and near us, but never to our table. Slopes = -1 stars, and that's why I had it at three stars at this time.  The food, of course, was great again, but it just wasn't the kind of wait we wanted. I'm looking for better restaurants. Station Square is cool, Hard Rock is cool, our waitress was NOT cool. Go to the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Serving sizes are moderate, food was good. The real \"plus\" to this restaurant was Shane. I don't think I have had a better waiter!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great service, delicious food and an amazing display. Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"Sehr schönes und modernes Ambiente. Es hat uns hier sehr gefallen. Das Essen kam schnell und war auch so wie man es im HRC gewohnt ist. Die Bedienung war freundlich und an unserem Tisch war ein IPad auf dem man sich die ganzen Ausstellungsstücke weltweit in den HRC ansehen konnte. Der HR Shop war gut sortiert und bietete viel Auswahl ( mehr als der beim HRC neben dem HR Hotel ). Auf jedenfall ist es einen Abstecher wert."}
{"text":"Hier haben wir es leider nicht geschafft zu essen daher bewerte ich nur den Rock Shop. Der Shop war einer der best ausgestattesten den ich je gesehn habe ( besser ist nur der in New York am Times Squere ). Die Mitarbeiter waren so freundlich und zuvorkommend. unermüdlich in ihren Bemühungen."}
{"text":"Das Café hat uns mal wieder richtig gut gefallen!!! Die Mitarbeiter waren sehr sehr freundlich und Serviceorientiert. Unser Kellner hat als M. Jackson gespielt wurde für uns einen Moonwalk hingelegt der seines Gleichen sucht. Das Essen hat hier die gewohnte HRC Qualität ( was ja leider auch nicht selbstverständlich ist). Die Exponate im Restaurant sind mittelprächtig spannend. Was uns dann aber umgehauen hat war der \" Musikbrunnen\" oder die Rockwassersiele. Ein Farbenmeer und ein Wasserschauspiel sondergleichen. Ich weiß nicht wie lange ich da zugeschaut hab. Der Rock Shop war okay aber nichts Besonderes. Freundliche Mitarbeiter, Standartauswahl. Mein Tipp, wenn ihr das HRC besucht wartet auf die Dunkelheit und geht euch dann das rockige Wasserspiegel anschauen. Es lohnt sich."}
{"text":"I took my son here for dinner. The hostesses are not very friendly, abrupt actually. After a long wait we were seated. The waitress was very friendly and the burgers were great.  The food is extremely overpriced which was annoying."}
{"text":"We came downtown to go see Marvel Universe live because I won the tickets from a local radio show.  We decided to eat here since it was so close to the arena. The food was as expected. My veggie sandwich was yummy my daughter got the mac n cheese and my husband got a burger. I am giving 2 starts for service because we got a pretty AWFUL server by the name of Noelle. She rushed us to order our drinks and our meals. We ordered potato skins as an appetizer and I didnt even get a chance to start eating my first one before our actual meal came out!!!  We also both ordered a beer and during our entire meal she never asked us if we wanted another beer even after my glass was totally empty she took my glass and brought me a water. I didnt even ask for water!  She had ZERO personality and was annoyed that I asked her for ketchup, mustard and salt and pepper.  Really!?  I would recommend eating at the bar next time and I would tell Noelle to pick a new profession. just because the receipt tells me hopw much of a tip to give you doesnt mean that you will get it for crappy service."}
{"text":"We really like getting over a hangover with breakfast here, but some of the staff make you feel like cattle. Cassie, the hostess, was real rude, too rude to even hear our request of a table outside, overlooking the strip. When we realized they were going to seat us in a different table, and tried to bring it to her attention, she didn't listen, and kept directing us to the seater. All with a bad attitude.  The food here is always good, and the servers are pros. Ashley, our server today, was attentive, and friendly.  We sat at the bar to wait for our table and had some great bloody Mary's made by Sarah.  Breakfast was good as always."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews.  Everything from the service to the food to the drinks was fantastic.  I have two picky eating teenagers and they have already asked if we can go back soon.  Our waiter was great-I didn't like the drink I ordered and was able to exchange it for something different, no problem at all."}
{"text":"Took the kids here for lunch and sat out on the patio. It was breezy day and kind of cool but the patio was in the sun and protected so it was perfect! I bet it gets super toasty in the summer though. Anyway, we were all entertained by the tourists and people walking down on the street. Food was amazing, waiters were friendly and helpful and the place was really nice."}
{"text":"Came a party of six at about 10:30 AM for breakfast. From the time we sat down, service was totally lacking. Had to ask for basic things like coffee refills, butter/jam for toast, water., etc. no smiling waiter/waitress. No one checking on us asking if we need anything, nothing like that. It was if we were intruding. Everyone seemed to be preoccupied making and delivering drinks to the morning partyers.   Food was decent although certainly not stellar. Apple juice served at room temperature, O.J tasted like it came from a can.   Acoustic breakfast is a cool idea and added some much needed light to an overall lousy experience.  This a duplicate review of the one I posted on TripAdvisor"}
{"text":"Oh my... I hate having to give a bad review, but the food here was not good at all. I give the 2 stars for the service, as our server was very attentive.   The atmosphere is fun, the location is great, but the food is just overpriced yuck. My husband said it was probably the worst meal he's had in Vegas. He had a pulled pork sandwich with his side dishes put in ramekins, more size suited for condiments. I'd ordered chicken wings and a side of fries. My chicken wings tasted like extra salty hotdogs. Not sure how that happened? Our kids had mac&cheese, and a kids cheeseburger. The cheeseburger looked fine, but my daughter wouldn't eat it because of the char grill. She's like Hank from 'King Of The Hill'  - wants to \"taste the meat, not the heat.\"     I can say with sincerity that I will not be back. Looks like a cool enough bar though. Stop for a drink, but pass on the food. There are so many better choices out there!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often. We always get the jumbo sampler, which is pretty good. We also get the full rack of ribs. That's really what we go for. They really are soo good. Best we've found.  They come with this citrus coleslaw that's to die for. We always end up overstuffed with just these two meals, between the both of us, and sometimes even take left overs home. Service is usually good. I've noticed staff doesn't  help each other out, which would be better of them to do. If you aren't one of their table, they won't even notice you."}
{"text":"This was the best. Brought my sister to Vegas for girls weekend. First breakfast we ended at Hard Rock. Egg Benedict, Bloody Mary's and the best waiter, Chris Gonzalez, he was attentive, big smiles, just the best. It is nice to have great experience first thing in the morning. PS. Food was good too!"}
{"text":"Got seated quickly, got drinks quickly, food got done quick and was deliscious. I recommend the california burger. Our server was awesome. It's also very hard to not like any Hard Rock Cafe"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but admit it, you don't go here for the food. The atmosphere was what you would expect from a Hard Rock, but the service was impeccable. Our server was there within seconds every time we needed her. At one point we joked that she must have a hidden microphone at our table. Average food, decent prices for Vegas, but stunning service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Once for lunch and once for the buffet before a Browns game.  The buffet was decent and the pre-game environment was fun.  The lunch left something to be desired.  My burger was really good, but our service was atrocious.    Our server was a young black woman with crazy eye makeup.  I'm not one of those people who freaks out about non-traditional makeup, but it differentiates her from the other servers.  My friend ordered a soda, I think it was sprite, and when it arrived she commented that it tasted bad, like the syrup had run out.  She told the server, who brought her a new one, which still tasted bad.  The server offered to bring her something else, but she said she would rather just have water and to take it off the bill.  The server was slow with the rest of our meal as well.  I don't think she was that busy, so I don't know why everything took so long.  Then, to top it off, as we left, she told me friend that someone else tried the soda and said it tasted fine.  WTF.  Someone needs a lesson in customer service.  Even if the soda was fine (which I doubt) my friend thought it tasted bad!  It's not like she drank it all and then complained to get it taken off the bill.  She wasn't complaining just to make the server run around, she simply wanted a soda that tasted right.  Is that too much to ask?  This girl needs to be fired.  If she had made that comment before we tipped I would have left her nothing."}
{"text":"Typical Hard Rock Cafe Menu. Mostly burgers.  Staff was very courteous, professional and experienced.  They validated parking as it is in a downtown, several story bldg."}
{"text":"Das allererste Hard Rock Cafe meines Lebens - und auch das letzte. Was finden nur alle an diesem Laden? Ok da hängt ne echte goldene Schallplatte von irgendwem, aber ich geh doch eigentlich zum Essen dahin?  Wir hatten eine Super Jumbo Vorspeisenplatte. Die Chicken Wings eher dürr und für die unterste Schärfestufe sehr scharf. Überbackene Kartoffeln bestanden im Wesentlichen aus Schale und dickem, teils schon harten Käse. Zwiebelringe groß, dick paniert und langweilig. Panierte Hähnchenbrust war ok. Dann noch ein paar Tacos, ohne großen Eindruck. Zum Glück hatten wir die zu viert, sonst wären wir schon jetzt satt.  Die Burger sahen ganz gut aus, meine Begleiter waren es zufrieden. Steak eines anderen Begleiters war zäh, ich hatte Fish & Chips mit angebrannten, kalten Pommes und Fisch in einer Betonpanade, die kaum zu knacken war. Der Fisch selber war schon etwas ältlich.  Service war soweit ok, Besteck wurde hin und wieder vergessen zu bringen. Wir saßen oben auf dem Balkon, das war ein guter Standort, um den Strip zu betrachten, während wir unser freudloses Essen aßen."}
{"text":"Skip it! Didn't expect much since this is a tourist trap, but service is terrible!   Literally sat for 25 min and no wait staff yet, not even for water.  Waitress clearly assigned to our table is too busy talking to table of cute guys next to us.   New waiter said he was just told to serve us because \"she\" said she was over loaded with tables.   Didn't even get apology.  Apparently crappy food and service"}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe is two blocks from the strip on Paradise Rd. It is easily identifyable by the enormous, topographically-incorrect neon Les Paul bolted to the front.   The place is loud and full of tourists, yet the service is friendly and efficient. They make a good avocado and pepperjack burger, however the steak fries were a bit underfried and very salty. Hard Rock has some nice tunes and rock memorabilia strewn across the walls, they also have a gift shop where you can another Hard Rock shirt for future painting days."}
{"text":"Sehr schönes HRC. Sehr nette Bedienungen, tolle Ausstellungsstücke. Als Gast kann man per Computer Voting immer das nächste Musikstück bestimmen."}
{"text":"Great location. close to Dundas sq. food is ok. bit pricey. sad to see this place go. and have a shopper world there."}
{"text":"Awful atmosphere and bar.  The one and only time I went, the waiter was using me as the butt of all of his jokes to my friends.  How inappropriate is that?!   This place has tourist trap written all over it; it's the type of place locals don't go to because the bad service relies on tourists and not repeat customers."}
{"text":"Cannot stress how wonderful this place is. Good was excellent, drinks were delicious and the host was fabulous. We visited three times during our stay and didn't get better service anywhere! Recommend chicken and waffles and twist and shout shake"}
{"text":"I knew I was walking into a tourist trap but this place is definitely a tired institution. You can find much better food, service and ambiance elsewhere. I was expecting an average experience but what dragged it down was the service I got from the bartender. He was all eager to get me drinks and food which had me feeling great but when I went to pay I had to literally chase him down. I was almost ready to just walk out of the place in frustration without paying because of that. Even the brits beside me were getting a little pissed to get his attention to pay their bill. I'm sorry but if my visa card is down on the table by my bill you would think that I would maybe want to pay for my bill. Most service staff I deal with can spot these simple queues but I sear my bartender looked like he had a joint out back earlier in the day by how droopy his face and eyes were. But that is just speculation.  The food isn't anything special and well I don't get exited over their selection of rock memorabilia. The music isn't normalized so you go between one song being LOUD then another being noticeably more quiet. Maybe this was a bad choice for me but I wouldn't recommend the place unless you are looking for a cheesy tourist trap to grab a bite."}
{"text":"In meinen Augen eine tolle Lage direkt auf dem Strip, große Panoramafenster, tolle Aussenterasse, groß, großer Shop. Essen/Karte wie überall. Man weiss was man bekommt."}
{"text":"Yep, kennt man ein Hard Rock Café, kennt man sie alle. Trotzdem ist das Essen zwar typisch amerikanisch, aber es schmeckt immer so, wie ich es mir auch wünsche. Die Bedienung war mal wieder , mehr werde ich nicht verraten. Der Burger war top. Schön medium das Fleisch und der Rest gut warm. Die Menge war okay. Nicht Zuviel und nicht Zuwenig."}
{"text":"2 stars for just the food. In Phoenix, we are currently having an heat warning, so water would have been great. I understand things get busy, 10 minutes is a bit of a long wait with the heat. The waitress came as I was heading to the to get water from the bar. She got our order. I asked for a root beer and a burger with no onions. The root beer came late and the burger came with onions. It may have been the kitchen's fault and the food was still good. The, who I am assuming was the manager, refilled our waters because the waitress was too busy doing whatever in the back. Never got a refill on the root beer, the drink I actually spend money on. Got the bill, but the waitress went M.I.A. for 15 minutes. Finally got up to ask a bus boy where a register was so we could pay. The waitress showed up as we were talking to him. It was disappointing because we heard such great things, but we did not get a decent service."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, cold and tasteless.  Service was good but it's a shame about the food, a big step down from the one in London UK"}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow, slow service. Decent food, but holy hell it took 15 minutes to get noticed, but after that our simple order of corn flake chicken strips was delivered rather promptly. Had a nice chat with the good looking waitresses; too bad we had a waiter :-(  The chicken was good except my throat was raw from alcohol and it was a bit hard to work down haha"}
{"text":"so ive been to both hard rock cafes the one in hollywood and in vegas, i have to say i liked hollywoods location alot better, to start with the prices are much higher, understandable for the locaation but damm, and food wise i got the twisted mac and cheese, the chicken was a little bland and chewy, and the nooodles didnt have much flavor as i had before. what good things i could say is i loved the strawberry lemonade and their selection of music theyy played really enjoyed that."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and so was the view. We sat outside on the second floor of the Hard Rock. Great view. The food was excellent and the drinks were strong. I had the shrimp fajitas which were cooked to perfect. It came with onions and peppers, guac, sour cream, salsa and tortillas. I also had the strawberry mojito. My friend had the beef and chicken fajita and she said it was very flavorful. She had a coconut mojito. My other friends had the hurricane and a raspberry rita. I can't remember what they had but they enjoyed it. Our waiter was excellent, never hovering, but always there to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"We made a last minute decision to stop here for breakfast based on a sign for bottomless mimosas. So glad we did! Food was yummy and the mimosas were delish ."}
{"text":"It's a Hard Rock Cafe. Like any other Hard Rock Cafe, the line will be long, the crowd will be tourists, the food will be American and the prices will be reasonably pricey. It's also very loud. But it is a Hard Rock Cafe, so the atmosphere is fun, and (because it is in Toronto) it isn't smokey. The merchandise is pretty much the same as other Hard Rocks, but it is still worth checking out, especially since you will probably have a 30 minute wait for a table to become available."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a long day of shopping on the strip.  The food was great, but the service was WONDERFUL!!!  The waiters/waitresses are very personable and will bend over backwards to make you happy.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the last couple of years for business lunches.   While the service is usually OK, the food has always been mediocre.    Today was the worst, though.  A friend and I ordered a glass of Glenlivet, neat (no rocks).   They served us something that was so watered-down it was unrecognizable.  The servers insisted there was no water added, and then the manager got involved and said the same thing.  Their arguments were insulting--the stuff was probably 50% water, no question about it.   Luckily all the lunches I've had at this place have been paid-for by someone else.  I wouldn't give a dime to this place when they rip you off with watered-down drinks and so-so food."}
{"text":"Geweldig Hard Rock Cafe! Niets is gehaast, ze kijken goed naar je om en het eten is erg goed!   We kregen gelijk een mooi plaatsje aangewezen, niets geen wachtrij. Je wordt goed geadviseerd en er wordt zelfs spontaan een gemeend praatje met je gemaakt.   Onze serveerster, Ashley verdiend een groot compliment, ze is vrolijk, geïnteresseerd en niet opdringerig. Ze kwam regelmatig bij ons checken of alles in orde was, zonder irritant over te komen. Top!"}
{"text":"We spent less than 2 full days in Phoenix, but when we discovered that there's a HRC here, we made it a point to go there for dinner.  We were blown away by the service--very courteous, friendly and fast.  Food was typical, & it really didn't matter because we were famished & everything tasted good.  Very impressed with this city.  Hope for a longer visit in the distant future."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around 11 am on a Saturday. Not too busy. Sat at the bar. No one approached us for the first 5 min or so. Finally the bartender,  Anthony,  took our order. However,  it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive. A manager came by to ask how we were doing. When we said we were still waiting for our food,  he said he didnt ask to hear us complain. After asking about our food twice,  Anthony finally brought it and didnt apologize or comp a drink or anything. It left a really bad taste in my mouth. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever today! Restaurant was full, but no waiting line. We waited 1/2 hour for Coke & water. We had placed food order with drink order. After a little over an hour with no food, we walked out. I have NEVER done that. The servers were NOT at fault. They were hustling. Just way understaffed. Manager should have visited tables to explain delay, or advised at the door that there was a staffing problem, and given customers the chance to move on. As it is, we won't visit ever again. We had previously visited many Hard Rocks in US & Europe."}
{"text":"Typisches HRC wie fast überall auf der Welt. Hier in Las Vegas, eines der 2 Hard Rock Cafe an der Ecke Paradise & Harmon schräg gegenüber dem Hofbräuhaus.    Innen sehr geräumig und im typischen HRC Style ausgestattet. Die Qualität der Speisen ist gleichbleibend, analog der anderen HRC. Ebenso die Bedienungen in Bezug auf Freundlichkeit und Schnelligkeit reihen sich nahtlos in die große HRC-Masse ein.    Bei diesem Hard Rock Cafe handelt es sich um das Original Las Vegas HRC, um das erste in Las Vegas. Das zweite HRC am Strip kam erst vor ca 2 Jahren dazu."}
{"text":"Great service from our server, she was kind, knowledgeable and helpful! The cocktails ruled! The glasses to take home make great souvenirs!!! Fun to hang out with all the music stuff around to check out! Would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful employees in the store area.  Except that one guy who was dogging on the Univ. of South Florida!  ;)  Prices are reasonable, layout is good.  Good job over there, folks."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Love collecting the glass beer glasses at every hard rock cafe. We went in May of 2015 and headed to the bar after having a filling lunch. We struck up a conversation with the bartender who was friendly and probably intrigued because we were asking about downlow places in town like The Laundry Room. She ended up giving us a round on her. Loved or experience there especially the Vegas friendliness from the bartender!"}
{"text":"I have visited over thirty different Rock Cafe's throughout the world including the two franchises here in Las Vegas the location on the strip has a lot less memorabilia than the off strip location, however they do have live music from time to time. The food is standard to all locations and my favorite dishes the giant sampler for an appetizer with a rack of ribs as the main course always hits the spot. The drinks are fine and I rotate through a few favorites to obtain my collectors hurricane glass. The staff was ok not up to standards of the normal hard rock cafe's. The manager did make an effort to meet and greet with all the patrons so that was a plus."}
{"text":"Horrible service over priced dog shit food that I got food poisoning from and crapped all over the sidewalk outside! The 18$ cheeseburger actually looked better when it came back out and probably tastes better! Hard rock cafe thanks for the forced diet! You guys SUCK"}
{"text":"Place was way fun, was with a big group of people and we had more fun here then we did having bottle service at XS. Hard Rock had a pretty legit cover band playing classic rock and roll and we were all piss drunk having a ball. I definitely recommend if your cougar hunting or looking to go out and have a good time with minimal drama!"}
{"text":"We had dinner today at the Hard Rock on the Vegas Strip. The staff was awesome, they were super friendly and they even made sure to tell my son that he could get free Wi-Fi,what waiter does this when they are super busy, well our waiter Johnny did this. The food was freshly made and tasted great! Great Location + Free Wi-Fi+ Awesome Service + Delicious Food = Repeat Customer Mary"}
{"text":"Terrible service on a Saturday night!? Watch your check. They add 18% without asking and it is hidden in with the meal charges. Don't know how I caught it but will not be back-ever. Oh and the food was bad all around. Spend your money else where!"}
{"text":"I find it's pathetic that you order the small ice cream that is $6.95 or  two dollars less than the sundae and it's only a couple small baby scoops in a massive glass. Very sad.  When we asked why the two small scoops are smaller than the scooper used for the sundae he said they do that to make the small ice cream look bigger. WTH?  BTW The cherry came from my wife's sundae. It did come with the HRC flag though. How cute.  I could have purchased two gallons of vanilla for the money spent on the two melon ball scoops of ice cream.  I am a black HRC VIP Back Stage card holder and have been a fan of HRC for over 30 years. They took my Lifetime membership away and now the food is turning to garbage. What is the problem?"}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe was totally amazeballz!!!! Sarah, Cameron, Bob and the hostesses were incredible!!! Even the guy downstairs (sorry we didn't get your name) but the service was incredible and the prices were sooooo affordable! We are definitely coming here every time we visit Vegas. Hard Rock Cafe is the bomb.com!!!  Thank you for making my mother's day gift all that and a bag of chips! You guys totally rock!!! Much love!!!"}
{"text":"Ich bin gerne in den Hard Rock Cafés, wurde hier aber leider enttäuscht. Die Preise für das Essen waren äquivalent zu denen die ich kannte (Hamburg, London, Dubai) nur nicht beim Bier! Da traff uns dann der Schlag. 12,35 $ für das erste Bier inkl. Souvenir-Glas. Das halte ich für Abzocke, zumal der Preis nirgendwo zu lesen war und die Souvenir-Gläser sonst optional sind.  Da Restaurant an sich war aber sehr schön (viele Elvis-Exponate) und die Burger sehr gut,"}
{"text":"We had our arrival dinner for our wedding here and it was great.  We didn't need our final count until three days prior so we didn't end up paying for more than we needed (30 guests).  We chose to have the dinner on the second floor in the main part of the restaurant since if you are going to the Hard Rock don't you want to hear the music, see the stuff on the walls and be in the middle of it all?  We did, and we liked it a lot.  The staff was great and the on duty manager was wonderful.  I think he new that I was the bride to be because I was so nervous when I got there but he checked in numerous times throughout the dinner.  They gave us a two hour window and it was perfect.  I recommend this restaurant for a large party for dining."}
{"text":"As this location is a bit off The Strip I can imagine that it wouldn't be as busy as some of the other downtown locations. This Cafe was small in comparison to others I have been in and the store was tiny!  The food, of course, was as great as it always is. They have a couple new items on their menus (apparently these were added last week, lucky us!). I would recommend everything except the Peanut Butter tiny dessert thing. I love peanut butter, don't get me wrong, but this was lacking another flavor. It tasted like I dipped my spoon in a jar of smooth peanut butter. There should have been another layer of chocolate sauce or cookies, or graham crackers. That would have been top notch then.  All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"We went here to eat when we arived in Las Vegas.... As you should know if you have ever been to a hard rock that they are very loud with music.  Our server was very nice and the manager came around to each table and asked how the servace was. i got the bacon burger it was amazing couldnt finish it though. the servers had great attitude but it was a very pricy meal and of cource you have to buy a t shirt and that doant come cheap! but i would go back but it wouldnt be my first choice."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today. It was alright. A friend of mine is always going there for drinks, since night life isn't really my thing, I thought a nice lunch would be more my pace.  We went and the server was good. Except towards the end, she started hitting on my friend! I was like, \"HELLO!! I'M RIGHT HERE!\" She still persisted and he just smiled and wouldn't give up a bigger tip.   After we ate, who I assumed was the manager, came up to our table and asked if everything was going well. We smiled and said yes. The decor was alright, everything you'd think of when you think Hard Rock. But nothing really stood out to me. It was like applebee's with more expensive wall art. The menu looked good, especially the drinks. I didn't try any of them. But they did sound good.   Over all, it was alright. But $30 for a couple of sandwiches and sodas?!?! I don't know about that! And even then, I barely got a handful of fries!! It so wasn't worth it!   It's a wonderful location and it is clean. That's a big deal to me! I'd go back, but I don't think I'd go before a game! I can see it getting really crowded really fast!"}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars if the burgers were seasoned and the Mac n' cheese tasted better. Our server Ronitta was amazing! I'd definitely suggest sitting in her section!"}
{"text":"I come here often. But nothing pisses me off more than a kitchen who tries to put out sub standard food like this one does a lot. I order the cob salad pretty standard for this place. I found they have one of the best. The last three times I've come here they keep giving me bad avocados In the salad. I'm sick of this. Listen you're a tourist location you rep our city and you don't do it well.   Well the kitchen is the ultimate reflection of your location. This kitchen needs to wake up. Tourist season is over so now you have to rely on its locals for the winter months. So why do let your kitchen put out sub standard food.   So if your looking for fake bullshit interior and a kitchen that lost its love for making good food than this is the place for you. The front staff is still good but the kitchen staff should go find a new kitchen. Sad but true on this review. :-(  That's the Real Deal on this Hard Rock !!!!"}
{"text":"It was just ok, which was not what I was expecting from a Hard Rock Cafe. The steak was fatty and lacked flavor. They do have good drink specials."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Service was good. Hostess & waitstaff were very attentive and overall great customer service! Food and drinks were very good. It was a great experience. We went to dinner & drinks on a busy Friday night and they were very great!"}
{"text":"Waitress didn't like us asking questions about the happy hour, the restaurant, told us we'd be thrown out if we bought happy hour drinks at the bar and went back to our table. One of our guests was irritated by the short answers from our service, especially considering the price of everything, and our waitress noticed. She responded by antagonizing him, carding only him when 3 people ordered alcoholic drinks,  questioning his homelife and how he was brought up, and sarcastically remarking \"Merry Christmas\" making no effort to hide her disdain.  If you like subpar service for excessive price and need to be crowded in to a cramped area with guitars and memorabilia then this is the place for you.  Our waitress wasn't the only one working on Christmas Eve but you'd have thought otherwise based on her mood.   Skip this one."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, I always enjoyed stopping by during my stay in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Aw man... I hate writing bad reviews but the food is pretty bad.  My husband and I dropped in this morning for breakfast - we both agreed this was basically a Denny's.  That said, our server was wonderful. I think she's the bartender too. Our drinks were great!! This lady was fun, outgoing, just amazing. Wish we'd liked the food so we could go see her again!"}
{"text":"I thought this would be an easy good meal, theres always something i like here. I tried the chicken tacos and my hubby got a burger. My tacos all had a few pieces of chicken, mostly lettuce and cheese, and the chicken was clearly frozen kind that turned rock hard during cooking and who knows if it was really chicken. My husbands burger was overcooked as well. The only reason id come back is for the good drinks, and twisted mac n cheese, bravo on those 2 items. Guess you could be a late nite stop for drinks and a a heaping plate of mac!"}
{"text":"It's burger was delicious as I expected. About its atmosphere, I believe Hard rick cafe in time square is more interesting."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a hard rock cafe and I thought the concept was pretty cool. The food was decent; my hash browns were very good (but also full of bacon bits and onion)."}
{"text":"this was a really cool spot! I was able to just see the upper venue where the event was and it was very cool. the balcony overlooked the strip, and thats always nice to have. Not  too many places to sit which stinks but everyone was nice and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Its the Hard Rock Cafe so can't go wrong, such a good vibe. Spacious bar allows for you to rest your elbows, much needed if you're hungover like I am  Oh bartender chick is singing and so freaking down to earth.   Great wings and try the mystery mojito!"}
{"text":"The Hard Rock at lunch on a Friday afternoon is a great way to finish off the week. Good food and a disk jockey who can play the most obscure classic rock you want. Awesome place to have fun and unwind for a hectic week."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus where do I start. Avoid this place for breakfast. Not only did it take almost an hour to order, it pretty much took that long just to get drinks... Like water. Then another 20 mins for alcohol drinks... And then another 10 mins for my coffee. The food was awful. Eggs (if that's what you want to call them) had a very weird texture to them. If you ever spent time in the military you'll know what I mean. The service there was non existent. Grant it, there was 11 of us there but that should be no reason why the service was that bad. We asked for butter and the girl pretty much said, \"Well I'm pouring mimosas right now.\" Huh? Ooooooookkkkkkkaaaaaaayyyyyy... Man, don't tell them that the service could have been better cause they'll return with a whole lot of excuses and no ownership of what they could have done better for us. Got double charged for gratuity so I paid with cash which I never do but I felt that I didn't  want to spend another couple of hours there. So again I plead with you... AVOID BREAKFAST THERE AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came with several people. I hadn't been to a Hard Rock Cafe in many years in the U.S. and the last time it was disappointing. Since that time, I've been to some in Japan and they were excellent. So I was hoping to have that same experience. I mean it's an American restaurant, so we should do better here. Wrong! For starters, we had to have two waiters serve us. One was good, but the other was clearly annoyed with having to deal with a large party. Then, some orders were wrong, and the food just wasn't good. So I won't be trying the Hard Cafe in the U.S. anymore."}
{"text":"I was just here visiting last week and my server Alejandro was the absolute best! He was awesome and made the afternoon so fun! I will be back because of him!!! and his singing voice!!! What a doll he was!"}
{"text":"Never deviated from the strip but this trip was worth it. Came to Hard Rock to go to their infamous concert/club The Joint to see Tiesto in concert. 3 levels of party is what wowed me! It was pricey for this Labor Day Weekend, costs us $3000 to get a table, $2000 for a bottle of patron, I'm not sure how much the bottle of Jack and 2 Grey Goose costs but at the end of this fun night total was $7900! Well worth the enjoyment and experience."}
{"text":"No complaints about the food. We had nachos, a side of their macaroni and cheese (yum!) and a side of ceaser salad.  Ok. I know the Hard Rock Cafe is more fun than your average restaurant. But I don't think the waiters should hit on you unless solicited. Mr. Waiter even had the audacity to pull up a chair, sit down at our table and say \"well I'm bored, its a slow night so I'm going to hang out with you ladies.\" Not cute. So I dropped an obvious \"boyfriend bomb\" to try and send a hint across, but no luck. As he handed me the bill he proposed a date. Hint clearly did not make the point earlier. ATTENTION CUTE WAITERS: We the customer must initiate the \"hitting on\" for it to be ok for you to return it."}
{"text":"Went in with a large party and was seated rather quickly. The atmosphere was great, the view was great the service was OUTSTANDING and the food was delicious. Clean and packed with happy customers and staff. Second time there and I will go back."}
{"text":"Every Hard Rock restaurant has inventory that is swapped between stores, and it is always really interesting to see what's on their walls.   This location is always more than accommodating towards myself and my family. I spent my last three birthdays here with my family and most recently they set up the back room for us. The server we had was also great. He made sure we were all taken care of.  Their food is delicious and the prices are just right for the quality. My only complaint is they got rid of my absolute favorite dish from any restaurant. I miss the Honey Citrus Grilled Chicken Salad. It had red onions, oranges, pecans, red pepper strips, cranberries, and blue cheese. Their honey citrus dressing was to die for. They swapped it out for a similar dish called Grilled Chicken Arugula Salad, but it's not as good as the former."}
{"text":"The server was attentive but getting the food was a little slow. The chicken nachos were awesome and the burgers were flavorful and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"The food is really good but since it is on the strip it is always busy !! The wait is worth it and the workers are always nice !"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly fun! This is not the kind of place we'd normally ever go but my husband wanted the Vegas experience for one meal...  Staff was really sweet and attentive. Our waitress Kristina was very friendly and did a great job.   The food wasn't bad either! I had the veggie burger which was tasty (the portobello was really tough, but otherwise good). It was also fun to see things like Elvis' outfits."}
{"text":"Horrible service...slow, inattentive. Took way too long to get a salad and chess urged out, as usual here. Will not come back. Slow service made me late for my game.  How long should it take for a salad and kids cheeseburger? Certainly not 45 minutes.  Not crowded either."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed with this hard rock...very few people and our service was very slow. The salad was very good but the fajitas were below average."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for breakfast and have had a great experience every time. The staff are super friendly. And the breakfast menu is great. The chicken and waffles are by far my fav."}
{"text":"Good place, at heart of downtown Toronto. Good food but the only thing that extremely shocked me was they do not accept debit card...just for that I'm giving two stars."}
{"text":"I'm giving this visit a 5-star rating mostly because of our server, Katelyn.  She was fabulous!  We visited Hard Rock, only because we had credit from our horrible Hard Rock experience in Myrtle Beach.  Katelyn was very attentive and we were never at a shortage of service.  At the end, she even brought our daughter a birthday shot (we hadn't even mentioned her birthday  - I'm assuming she made the mental note when checking ID's).    Food, drink, service and atmosphere were spectacular!  A much enjoyed experience after our less than stellar experience months earlier in Myrtle Beach."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good.  Service is great!  Casedilla was so good.  Chicken and waffles was delish."}
{"text":"I've never been one to gravitate toward theme/chain tourist trap establishments, though, for their memorabilia and crap, I can see the allure. Buy a beer, walk around and see some dead guys' guitars. Done. At least, that's what I observed might have been cool to do when I ended up there after the Depeche Mode concert across the street @ US Airways Center (I miss BOB, it made it so much more personable, but anyway).    So, DM let out about quarter til 11, and my group all decided to go grab one @ the Hard Rock, and maybe get something to eat. When we walked up, 2 blonde waitrons were at the door, holding it open for us, saying \"Just so you know we just called last call, and aren't serving food. In fact, we should already be closed.\" CHARMED! So, a music-themed restaurant/bar, located directly across from an arena that frequently hosts ummm, CONCERTS, wouldn't plan to capitalize on the outflow of excited music fans and perhaps stay open  and make some monayyy? OK. As a bartender, I'd have insisted that it be so. This summer sucked for the service industry, and I found it so surprising that such an establishment wouldn't have been more malleable to perhaps retain and dare I say, boost the morale of their  staff by anticipating and catering to a late crowd of people who'd rather spend $5 (ok, $5.46) as opposed to $11 @ the arena for some post-concert frosty bevs. Have a little bump in their take-home scrilla for the night, and I dunno, fun? Meh.  And there were about 15 other people in there at the bar, too. The only person there who was workin it was the bartendress, though, she too, seemed like she was a bit put-out that she had a bunch of customers come in last-minute. I do give her props for salting the rim of my pint glass and pouring a DosXX for me without having the salt volcano all the beer out of the glass.   Maybe it's the corporate management bs that was in the way. Maybe not. Either way, they need to get it together on the hospitality tip."}
{"text":"First, the food I had here was AMAZING.  My burger was SOOOOO good.  The problem was the service.  We went here for lunch on a weekday, probably around 11am (it was early and lunch had just started).  We were STARVING, which is why we were eating on the strip in the first place.  There were only three tables, including us.  The place was pretty much empty.  After being seated with menus, we were deserted.  We did not see another employee for at least 20 minutes, and when we managed to flag him down and ask where our server was (I mean, it's not like they were busy), he said that he'd go get our server.  It was a while later before the server finally showed up to take our order.  Again, we were starving.  After ordering, it happened all over again.  We thought that, surely, after leaving us with NO service after being seated they'd be attentive and get our order through fast.  (Still, only about three tables were seated, including us).  Boy were we wrong!  Our orders took FOR EVER.  A table that had arrived about ten minutes after us paid their bill and left about ten minutes before the food ever showed up.  I haven't experienced that kind of wait at any restaurant on a busy night on the strip ever.  After having to hunt down our food, we finally ate and our server apologized for the delay.  We were very dissatisfied and when he brought the bill he said he'd apply his employee discount to make up for the bad service, but that was all he could do.  His discount was 5%.  Meh.  It was pretty expensive anyway (being on the strip) and little that discount didn't really rectify much.  Also, I figure places like these usually have coupons or gift cards or something to give out in a situation like this and we didn't get anything like that.  The only reason this is two stars instead of one is that 1) the food was insane and 2) at least the server made some kind of tiny effort to acknowledge our bad experience by giving the slight discount.  But I still can't get what the delay was.  Maybe their server was also the chef.  And the hostess.  And the bartender.  And the janitor.  And the guy out front entertaining pedestrians..."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here before our night out in Station Square for a bachelorette party. We were VERY entertained by our server and other employees. We played games against the other bachelorettes. Our server was great for the number of people we had. Food was ok. I've never really been a fan of Hard Rocks food but we did enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. 20 bucks for a pasta plate that tasted like microwaved chicken and mac and cheese pasta. You're definitely paying for the gimmick here, much like eating at Bubba Gump.  Service was ok. The check in discount helped alleivate some of the pain when I got the check.  If it weren't for my parents wanting to try out the cafe I would have never chosen to eat here, and I still would not come back with the price they charge, especially since across the street is a beer hall. I have to admit I very much looked longingly at the exit every time I thought about it."}
{"text":"The spinach dip was good but the burger was quite dissapointing and they burned the onion rings they charged me more for.  Service was also very slow"}
{"text":"I had a great chicken club sandwich and the price was a little bit pricey. I believe that it was because of the \"BRAND NAME\" Hard Rock Café and for their profits. I enjoyed the meal. It was short walk distance from the Conference Center."}
{"text":"Unpleasant hostess, out of the two items we wanted and then the overpriced food we got was mediocre! The server was nice, which is the only reason this review got 2 stars. Should have known better ..."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service & treated very poorly for being a Vegas local. Food was ok but over priced & the waiter awkwardly put his hands on my food & then transferred it onto my friends plate that wasn't done eating. After realizing what he did, we patiently waited an additional 20 minutes for a $19 hamburger to go. When the manager came and brought the burger, she said we are even going to give you this burger? Excuse me, but we should have never even had to pay for the service and the severe uncomfortable feeling of the waiter touching my food! I bet he didn't tell the manager that!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and terrible food also. We all got a little bit of everything and was extremely disappointed with the food quality, taste, temperature  and prices. Won't be coming back here. I'd rather eat at McDonald's"}
{"text":"First I've been to Hard Rock all over most are just OK, they are stupid expensive burger joints.   But if I had to pick the best one this would be it.   The Toronto hard Rock is always better than the rest."}
{"text":"Poor service .. went to the bar just thinking I could get my drink quicker than sitting at a table and the bartender totally ignored me and went back to the kitchen. . I had to go back to the host to get seated and another 10 minutes to get a server while there was 4 servers by the door just seating around. Finally got a server and got my order but half of my food wasn't even available wtf. I'm a fun of the hard Rock Cafe in las vegas I guess those guys need some training"}
{"text":"The food was delicious our server originally from Seattle, WA (his name escapes me) was extraordinary!! What passion be displayed for his job!! We were visiting from a small town near Memphis, TN. We will revisit Hard Rock when we return."}
{"text":"I actually came here for a concert that was happening in the restaurant, so we decided to eat here as well out of convenience.  I will say that the restaurant itself is pretty cool with its music theme, but if you are coming here to eat be prepared to be let down. It's definitely another one of those places that seemed like it had better food when I was a younger kid. The burger is very basic and unmemorable. My wife got the fajitas, which were actually kind of gross. We did enjoy the potato skins that we ordered as appetizers though, so the meal wasn't a complete waste. It is a nice place to see a show, but the food isn't really worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been going to hard rocks cafe all over the place, my wife going today, for a bite to eat, food was so so have had better, staff looked like they didn't really be there, one guy had to wear his sunglasses, and if your a pin trader FORGET about. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very fitting restaurant and atmosphere before our group of 21 enjoyed the Billy Joel ( and Gavin DeGraw opening right across the street at the US Airways Center) concert.  The food was awesome and served hot and promptly- the  grilled salmon was perfect and the mashed potatoes were to die for; ribs were huge and tasty. The chocolate cheesecake was delicious. The awesome Stephanie set this up for our large group of 21 and we had 2 large tables reserved and set up right smack in the middle of the main dining area. Our servers Catie and SaBeth were spectacular - on the ball, very caring and patient with this sometimes crazy and demanding group of ex NYers. It was a fun atmosphere with Billy Joel songs playing and the waitresses leading the guests in clapping, singing \" Happy Birthday\" to our friend Gail and just having fun. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Hard Rock Café..  great we have it in Pgh but just such a small place. I have been to concerts and just uncomfortable every time I visit because of the lack of space.   The bar is very tiny.. that surprises me every time I visit.  I was celebrating a friends birthday over the weekend. She has never been to the Hard Rock so we went.  $8.75 for her cocktail and $10.95 for nachos.  I know it's the Hard Rock so one would expect the prices to be above average.. ok that's cool but for nachos.. hardly had anything on them.. very little salsa..  it was 75% chips!  I included a picture.   It's fun to pop in for  a drink but that's about it. Its way to expensive and not a great venue to see a band in (unless you have reserved seating maybe)."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great. I got the bacon hickory bbq burger and it's absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"It was a cold November night.... All of the other places near Massey Hall were PACKED (notice the CAPS) I mean PAAAAACCCCKKKKKED!!!!!  So, we went here as a last choice and well as the previous nice people have thoroughly detailed...It's average (at best) Personally not a big fan of the prefab food resto's.. but when desperation is abound, you gots to do what ya gots to do.  We had the \"famous platter\" that was luke warm and full of the boring typical bland items... Nacho's and wings etc. ZZZzzzzz So if all else fails you might want to keep looking."}
{"text":"I'm saddened by the fact that the Hard Rock at Yonge/Dundas is going to get pushed out after 40+ years in business for yet another drugstore. That's capitalism for you.  Although I didn't have the chance to try it in the past, I finally made up for it by convincing the family to go a week ago. I had received tickets for a show at the Elgin Theatre down the street and wanted to visit the Hard Rock before they close in a couple months. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and quality of food.  I've always been a stickler for fish and chips - you know a restaurant has hit the mark when they have good fried fish. The plate I ordered here had massive portions, the good kind of creamy coleslaw and a heaping handful of beefeater fries for $17 - well worth the money, and the taste was great. My mother and aunt went for the veggie burgers, and were both impressed with the quality. It's difficult to get a veggie burger right, so any place that nails it is one well worth visiting.  If there's something I wasn't really keen on, it's the \"commemorative\" glasses they sell if you order certain drinks. While I get that they're selling it as a marquee experience and want you to feel like you're taking home a souvenir, I'm not spending $7 extra on a cup for my drink. I think they're pushing this aspect relentlessly because the restaurant is closing soon.  That said, the shop inside the restaurant had a lot of interesting items to buy, and the memorabilia was quite impressive. We ended up sitting at a booth near a guitar signed by Nickelback (lol) and a blazer worn by Gord Downie of The Hip. Quite a cool ambiance.  I'd definitely recommend checking out the Hard Rock before it closes. Great food, great atmosphere. Can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"It was the first time I'd ever been to a HRC and it was incredible. Went in with my daughter about noon on a Tuesday, restaurant was empty  and Cody was our server. He was very attentive and personable, I've honestly never had better service. My daughter and I shared the bruschetta, Mac and cheese (without the roasted red peppers) and the hot fudge sundae. Overall I have no complaints, it was a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Food was good. Hamburger was excellent! Fries were just as good as well as the dipping sauce. Service was also good."}
{"text":"Spent Christmas weekend in Las Vegas and had dinner and breakfast here and both were pretty good. I wasn't crazy about the hollandaise sauce on my Benedict but it was still good and the service was excellent! The morning and dinner staff was awesome! I am super happy with our experience here especially since they had to work on Christmas. We sat at the bar and all our drinks were excellent! So happy we stopped in. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Condescending waiter who seated us today. Gave us the worst placing near a street corner when there was ample good seating available. When we asked for better seating, he said we would have to wait a long time. When we showed our dissatisfaction he glared at me and gave a dirty look. Didn't get his name, though he was tattooed on both arms.  Our waitress Krystal was helpful and pleasant which made up for the gentlemans attitude.  Have been to hard rocks in many continents but never experienced this before."}
{"text":"Fun place, great service (the best we had all week), great wings! We were looking for a fun, lighter fare. Wings and beer were perfect (added nachos too). Really fun place with great music history/costumes. Really enjoyed our time. The place is awesome!"}
{"text":"My most favorite Hard Rock ever. I went all the time when I lived there (it opened in 2009) and recently went on a trip back. The cafe is located on the 2nd floor with a great bar and nice patio area, which over looks the strip. The food may be a bit overpriced, but it's still good. So much better than HOB - will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the place. Our server Vicki was incredibly awkward and often missing and the food was subpar.  I do love the theme of the restaurant with old rock music playing throughout the restaurant. The cool ambiance doesn't make up for the subpar food that lacked seasoning or reason! They have half off appetizers, but trust me, it's not worth it"}
{"text":"Meh, it's ok.  Not as good as some of the other Hard Rock's I've ate at.  The waitress was friendly but overwhelmed a bit, and the food was just ok."}
{"text":"First night in Phoenix and my friend and I stopped here. I got the hickory barbecue bacon cheeseburger with barbecue sauce, cheddar, bacon, tomato, lettuce, and caramelized onion. My friend got the mushroom and swiss burger, which I guess was the \"legendary burger\" at the time. Both came with their regular seasoned french fries. Understandably, service was a little slower since we got there later in the evening and it was a busy night to begin with. We had fun looking at all the memorabilia on the walls while we waited though. It was a little more meat than I could handle, but it was good and cooked to my liking. Came out to $15.11 after tax for just my order, so a little more on the expensive side but arguably we were satisfied enough that dessert was not necessary"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch with appetizers and returned after taking the ducky tours with my sister and nieces. This location had lots of memorabilia and music but what I liked was the environment was not so loud as other Hard Rock Cafe locations.  The service and food was excellent. If you go to ducky tours you get a coupon for 15 percent off at hard rock which is a good deal!  They have an entertaining water fountain which my young nieces really enjoyed getting wet."}
{"text":"Just had twisted mac and cheese. Never again. 20 bucks for mush. 10 dollars to park. I spent 85 dollars. Never again. Since moving from paradise location. Not the same"}
{"text":"OMG.. Unless your a tourist and just want to give your money away.. stay away.. seriously.. the nachos are like $17 with chicken and are so average. The food was average but tasted tainted knowing i was getting jacked up on the bill. Service was great.. (Why not I was like one of 5 people there getting abused). So if you want to give your money away.. give me call.. I will make u some mach and cheese or something and charge u $20.. let u check out my collection of vintage vinyl and bam.. your getting a better deal than that joint..   Wont repeat unless I am looking to take some sales rep deep or something.. it blows.."}
{"text":"I've been to hundreds of concerts across the country and I'm attempting to write a review of every venue to assist my concert going troubadours.  Chris Knight - August 11, 2016  I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars.  On one hand, excellent staff; we didn't want for anything. At one point, we asked for water and received free bottles. The three of us did run up a $170 bar tab in 2 hours, so this was a nice courtesy - shows the staff is paying attention to their customer needs.   The bathrooms are immaculate and the sound was pristine (acoustic show).   But, I'm used to rowdy venues where beer bottles are whizzing past my head and the concertgoers are moshing. Hard Rock as a concert venue was a little too corporate, too sterile (a little too expensive) and I'm afraid I might lose some street cred writing so favorably about it.   The one issue I have is the venue must have sat dinner patrons up to a certain time because there were a lot of kids and older people wandering around, in and out of the bathrooms and down the ramps (generally people who wouldn't attend a Chris Knight show). It felt like going to my nephews' birthday party where alcohol is served, but you can't get drunk in front of the kids and grandparents. Overall, it restrained my rowdiness a little."}
{"text":"I came to the Hard Rock Cafe for the first time in my life, totally alone in Vegas, and I hella dig it here.  The crowd around the bar are varied and chill, and the bartenders are insanely nurturing.  I must have been asked \"are you all right, honey?\" at least 8 times.  There's a fantasmic-shmastic mixed drink here called the Pickled Tink: raspberry Stoli, pina colada and Grenadine.  I had two.  Also, their french fries can't be beat."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious and the service was great! I enjoyed the California Chicken Club Sandwich and my friend had their Classic Macaroni and Cheese. Our waitress was very nice and we even received 20% off with our concert tickets to the show that night! My only complaint is that the menu is pricey but otherwise what a nice restaurant to stop by for dinner before seeing a live music show :)"}
{"text":"They advertise happy hours from 2-7pm but no appetizers or food are available during happy hour! Drinks are only Budweiser, white Zin, one merlot and whiskey that's it? Really?? Not  really happy house of everything else you par regular price! Great DJ music thought hence the 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Our server Leilani was absolutely amazing.   Decore is wonderful, food is good, little expensive."}
{"text":"After an entire morning of running errands downtown, I deserved better than Eaton Centre food court styrofoam. I didn't plan to spend much, but I needed to take my time in a tranquil environment.  Which doesn't explain why I ended up at the Hard Rock, but this is not the Court of Law..and I don't need to explain myself.  The Maitre' D was perhaps the most 'chilled' I've encountered, decked out in serious pins on his uniform sweater vest. I noticed all of the staff there had different amount of pins, seriously tacky. Maybe it was to distinguish who rocked harder? I've never been to a Hard Rock cafe in my life, but this was a Toronto Landmark (it's been there forever). I was seated by the window with an agreeable view of Dundas Square, and Yonge Street. Maybe I just have bad luck, but I seem to have an affinity with Toronto's wobbly tables. I can't recall the last time where I was given a table that didn't wobble.  The walls were decked to the ceiling with musical memorabilia. There was a James Brown Tunic, a keyboard used by Depeche Mode, and a bunch of other framed items on display that I couldn't make out the name of. It's a rather large space, and there are plenty of C shaped booth seating for parties of eight, or more. There's a TV at just about every corner of the restaurant, screening the video that correspond to the music that is playing. The music was a somewhat over ambient, but somehow I was able to tune it out while I people watched.  I ordered the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, and the Chicken Scaloppini Parmesan. The springs rolls was good, it came in a fisherprice looking cocktail bowl, with something that resembled Greek salad.  The parmesan was alright, a bit boring, but that's what I get from ordering off of the frugal lunch menu.  I don't think I've ever had a more tentative waitress since coming to Canada. She must have asked me how I was doing a dozen times. Each time with a bigger smile than the last. I couldn't bring myself to feel annoyed.  At the end of my meal, Louis Armstrong's 'It's a Wonderful World' came on, and I thought that was a pleasant ending to my lunch.  I tipped 18%, as it indicated on my receipt, and left without saying goodbye to Mrs. Happyface.  I can't imagine myself coming here for dinner, because I can imagine how this place could get quite rowdy when packed. But a great venue for a nice lunch by yourself. If you can tune out the music that is."}
{"text":"We always stop here for lunch on my annual trip to Vegas. The food is always great! Fresh, hot, and tasty. They have a simple menu, but they do it right. They always have great service too."}
{"text":"My bucket list is to attempt to visit all HRC locations!!  So, I'm now crossing off Las Vegas location!  I'm a big fan of the franchise and music, however, this location did not live up to its representation or as compared to other cafes."}
{"text":"My bucket list is to attempt to visit all HRC locations!!  So, I'm now crossing off Original Las Vegas location!"}
{"text":"My bucket list is to attempt to visit all HRC locations!!  So, I'm now crossing off Phoenix location!  Dined in and enjoyed all the memorabilia displayed. New location in downtown PHX next to the D-Backs stadium.  Seems to get a good amount of traffic during events but during the weekend it wasn't busy at all.  Sat at the bar ordered a sampler platter and food was pretty good.  Big fan of the restaurant and collected a new pin to add to my collection."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but I feel like it's my duty to all to warn people DO NOT ORDER NACHOS HERE. My friends and I decided to order some nachos to split and were sadly disappointed. There were not many chips to start with, but then to add insult to injury there was what I can only think was \"cheese product\" dripped over a few of the chips. Pretty sure it was liquid fake cheese. There were also random brown beans just sort of tossed haphazardly on the plate. Looked gross, tasted worse. Hard to mess up nachos but they most certainly did. I have also had a very dry veggie burger here. So all in all, ok for drinks but skip the food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We came for the pierogies and kielbasa entree featuring Pierogies Plus Pierogies.  Unfortunately the Pierogies were undercooked- pure sacrilege!  The kielbasa was tasty but had a few large chunks of bone in it.  The portion sizes were very modest for the price.  Sour cream was $2 extra.  The kids meals at $8 were a total ripoff!"}
{"text":"The location of this hard rock couldn't be better! We flew in and wanted to get a good meal in before our camping trip at Zion. We sat for an extended amount of time before we were even greeted at our seat.  Finally, when another waitress noticed us looking around, she found someone to wait on us. Thankfully, our waiter was great. He went above and beyond to make our experience at the restaurant good! We needed extra chips for the spinach artichoke dip - no big deal! The bartender accidentally made an extra mojito, and our waiter brought it to our table to try instead of throwing it out!  I asked for light on my dressing for my grilled shrimp ceasar salad, but it was definitely not light! Heavy on the dressing. I would recommend just getting it on the side. I gave a lack of star for the hair my friend found in her chicken chopped salad - otherwise she said it tasted great. To finish our visit off on a good note, our waiter comped us a vanilla fudge Sundae with a cherry on top. I applaud his effort."}
{"text":"When to the Hard Rock today for dinner with the family.  I have to say at first we were very excited to eat there. That excitement quickly went down hill.  When we first went in we were told that we had to eat outside because the band was doing a sound check. There were other propel eating inside why couldn't we? Anyway once seated our waitress quickly took our drink orders and didn't return for  at least 10 mins! We asked if the restaurant had a allergen menu and we were told No! The waitress did offer to ask about things but seemed bothered by our questions. After we ordered it took forever to get our food . It was ok but not worth the 13 bucks for a cheeseburger and soggy fries. Our waitress only stopped by our table once and said and I quote \" everything is ok here right?\" And took off before we could answer. It's not like the place was even busy! We spoke with the manager after dinner about the service and insisted on discounting the check which was very kind of him. When our waitress  brought our new check we realized she even over charged us for a drink we didn't order! Avoid this Hard Rock! There is much better for and service in station square!   Overall   2 out of 10 Food    3 out of 10 Service    0 out of 10"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and in last 4 months. My wife who loves chicken wings has not finished her order twice.  First time we ordered them fried, dry dry dry. Second time grilled, dry dry dry. What the heck  even after dipping them in extra sauce plus ranch you guessed it, dry dry dry. The burgers are average at best. The friends we dined with said the same comment, average food. Nothing to write home about. Our servers Kyle and Big Deb did give us Good service. We attend a monthly car event there so we want to patronize the business, but next time we will eat before we get there. On average plan to spend at least $33.00 for a dinner for 2 not including tip. We ordered  a burger with fries an order of wings and two ice teas."}
{"text":"MK and Luis were simply amazing.... went to a Mercury game stopped to eat and our experience was incredible.  Management was hands on and we will be back."}
{"text":"What a terrible place that is going to stay in business.  The menu is overpriced and applebee's grade at best.  The servers are rude and service is slow.  I really dislike this place.  I live 2 blocks away and I have been there once and do not plan on returning.  ever.  When I was there I asked the server what microbrews they had on tap.  She didnt know what I was talking about, so I asked what beers they had on tap.  She listed a very few and then said \"oh, and hefeweizen\", I asked what kind of hefeweizen, and she said \"hefeweizen\", I asked who makes it, she said \"hefeweizen\".  I tell her that that is a style of beer, and that some company makes it, which one?  She repeats \"hefeweizen makes it\".  I'm pretty upset at this point and tell her that I'll have a water. I wait for her to leave, walk to the bar, and look at the tap handle - \"Pyramid - hefeweizen\".  /sigh  never again.  oh and the food sucked."}
{"text":"Ok... if you're hungry, hung over and needing something yummy to hit the spot. Don't go here.. ha! The decor and gimmicky stuff is pretty much the only thing that's great about this place. I love that you get a take home glass with your beer :) but the food is just yuck! Bar food that's gotten even blander than it already is! Our service was great, she was fast and friendly but it just didn't hit the spot. I don't even remember what anybody had - but seriously. Go here for the souvenirs, not the food!"}
{"text":"Despite my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino on 1/4 I came here for dinner with my guy and another couple from a wedding we attended earlier that day. I have always loved Hard Rock because I'm a huge rock and roll fan and love going to a place that plays great music and music videos and has memorabilia hanging.   This location, like the others, was outstanding like the others I have been to previously. I can't remember our waiter's name but his name tag did say Shaggy. He was so friendly and just hilarious! He had great suggestions on food and drinks and we talked about music. He even brought over the very nice music manager who took requests from us and played them. I had requested Simple Man by Lynard Skynard which they didn't have but they had the Shinedown version so he played that. The rest of what we requested, The Doors, Hendrix, etc were all played.   I had duo fajitas and they were really good. The seasoning was amazing and the char on the chicken was perfect. All in all really great food and atmosphere. I will continue to go to Hard Rock Cafes!"}
{"text":"Chain burgers and beer. I must say, the burgers were sizable and tasty.  The thing I really thought stood out was the kids menu.  There was a chicken topped salad on the menu for kids...I really appreciate restaurants that go beyond mac-and-cheese and chicken nuggets. The price is a little high, the ambience is rock and roll ephemera and loud music but these were all expected."}
{"text":"Wie immer toll!  Wir sind mit der Zeit richtige HC Fans geworden. Die Rinderrippen sind ein Gedicht.  Das \" gerupfte\" Schwein ist wie immer ebenfalls zu empfehlen."}
{"text":"Well let's start with the restrooms and woman's at that, were disgusting! Our silver at our table had finger prints all over them, which tells me they are dirty. We ordered nachos and chicken fingers. Simple right? Well we asked for chicken on nachos and it looked like chicken off of chicken wings. Lots of fat. The waitress was odd and wouldn't go out of her way to fix it. I will not ever step foot in the establishment again. Worst  service, food and unclean place I've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Love their Chop House Salad.  Some entrees can be too salty.  Overall, a fun place!"}
{"text":"There for 10 mins at the bar waiting for a drink and some appetisers, but no one seemed to be interested in serving us..... We literally had 3 bar staff walk past us in that time, my wife and I astonished that they pretended to play with the cash register and/ or check the ink in the pens rather then serve us.... I finally walked around the bar where there was a worker and asked him if there was any chance, he gave me a pretty poor excuse saying that it was shift change and that he would be with me when they were ready, didn't look up and give me eye contact, nor the time of day....... Well, no worries mate because I won't, and will be advising all my family and friends not to, step in to a hard rock again in their life...... Worse place I gave been to travelling the states...... If I could give 0 stars, I would....."}

{"text":"Such a great space for live music! And solid for food and drinks. Staff is beyond rad, especially the bartenders on the 3rd level. T Money Tressa behind the bar is attentive AND makes a mean cocktail. Couldn't ask for better service!"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and first time at the hard rock. My waitress was Tessie and she was fantastic! Outstanding service, super friendly and personable, on top of everything with the order. 0 complaints. Food was delicious! Service was outstanding! For sure ask for Tessie when you come here. Will be back on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was SO nice and helpful but the food was HORRIBLE and very over priced. We had a steak and a hamburger and the bill was $90. The price might have been easier to swallow if the food had been edible."}
{"text":"Good location right across from the U.S. Airways arena. It looked pretty busy but they were able to seat us right away. Food and service was on par with other Hard Rocks we've been to. Drinks were overpriced and  watered down though. My advice is to stick with beer or wine here."}
{"text":"-- Great little Hard Rock Cafe in Downtown!! ****Service and food were pretty good.   They even had a small fashion show going on the night of the 26th. :)  Very entertaining!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place to have a light snack and it was definitely worth it. Chicken wings were so good!!! The drinks were amazing as well. I got the Mai Tai and that had a great amount of alcohol and was not watered down. Music playing some great throwbacks, really helped the mood. I loved the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always going to the Talking Stick arena across the street, and we've never checked out Hard Rock cafe, but we decided to go yesterday an hour before the Suns game and we are so glad we did! We sat at the bar and ordered a draft Budweiser and a draft dos equis, which we served to us quickly. We didn't really want to order full on entree's so we decided to split the Jumbo appetizer(Signature Wings, Onion Rings, Tupelo Chicken Tenders, Spinach Artichoke Dip with Parmesan flatbread and bruschetta. Served with honey mustard, hickory barbecue and blue cheese dressing, we had ranch instead.) for $20, but it was delicious, we ordered a few more drinks and headed out to the Suns game just in time !"}
{"text":"Total disappointment at this Hard Rock,  a common tourist trap, had lunch with my friends here a group of 5 only 1 was satisfied, our server was a gentleman reason for the 2 stars, the food was mediocre, over priced for the quality we received, the beverages was nice except for the organic things they put in your glass. I tried it and that will be the end of it."}
{"text":"Nice staff!   Steak and salmon was great,  pulled pork not so much, was  mushy,  the mashed potatoes and coleslaw were yuck!  Nice staff tried to make up for it tho!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night because everything else was closed. Deafeningly loud music, insanely overpriced drinks. Seriously $14.99 for one mixed drink? GFY. Our server was OK, he was really busy. We both ordered salads and they were missing key ingredients (avocado, egg) but that was due to a new guy in the kitchen, which is understandable. Great atmosphere outside on the river but I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick burger or sandwich when you are visiting Station Square."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical about this place, considering it's a big chain. One of my buddies works here and has been hounding me to come in visit. So I finally did last night. I was pretty impressed. The decor is pretty hip, just like the casino itself. They had a separate menu for some specials they had. We ended up ordering from that menu. For an appetizer we have bacon wrapped jalapeno's. I thought this was gonna be a run of the mill popper, but it was actually a whole jalapeno stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. It was AMAZING! And super spicy, which is how I like it! For dinner, I had the filet mignon and asked to add on blue cheese, which was not a problem at all. It was super good. My boyfriend got the fish n' chips, which is odd cause he hates seafood, but he enjoyed it. The drinks are kind of pricey, but hey, it's the strip so it's not uncommon. My friend gave us a deal on the food, which even sweetened the whole dinner!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Slow . Service sucks. They lie about prices. Place is small. Will never be back. They need to be shut down. Bar tender is on speed and sucks."}
{"text":"Forget what you know about the Hard Rock Cafe in (insert city here). Go to the new one on the strip and prepare to have your music loving mind blown!  I stopped by just a couple of days after what was the \"soft opening\".  My server says a big grand opening event will happen in October and Chris Cornell will perform.  More on that later.  This has to be the biggest and most detailed Hard Rock anywhere.  According to the staff it's been in the works for four years and it shows.  It's prime location on the strip is just the start.  Once you walk in you'll get a number that directs you to the second or third level dining areas.  I got level 3 which features a huge split level dining hall, full size bar and a small intimate stage for live acts at the back of the room. (see Chris Cornell above). The number of mouths this place can feed at a time is huge at more than 800 seats.  Just imagine the kitchen on a busy night!  The food is the same menu at any Hard Rock.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was a lot better than expected, especially the bacon.  Pricing at 13 bucks is a little high but you are on the strip and at the best HRC ever built.  It would be nice if the drink menu included pricing.  It was relatively slow when I was there.  And since all the staff is new they are eager to please and clearly instructed to go for the upsell.  After the meal you can just roam around and that's where it gets really fun.  The path to the third floor restroom is lined with infamous and at times chilling news headlines of the deaths of Lennon, Elvis and both Kennedys.  On a lighter note, a special room is dedicated to wedding memorabilia.  Elvis and Priscilla, John and Yoko, Ike and Tina and my heart skipped a beat when I came across a signed acoustic from Kurt Cobain at the Kurt and Courtney section.  Another awesome moment was a drum set from White Zombie mounted on the wall as you go down the stairs.  Another thing that makes this place unique is all the interactive technology.  Lots of Microsoft Surface tables and a huge touchscreen wall where you can check out everything that's on site.  If this doesn't become the flagship HRC soon I will be shocked.  Anyone who loves music (anyone with a pulse) needs to grab a meal or drink here."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful location of the Hard Rock cafe. It is really nicely kept up. The service was good and I love their Haystack chicken salad."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Hard Rock Cafe, you've been to them all.  But there's still a novelty to seeing Jimi Hendrix hot pants combined with a hi-hat used by Styx that makes it an appealing choice once in a while.  The Las Vegas location is situated near the Hard Rock Hotel.  You'd think there'd be a Hard Rock Cafe inside the Hard Rock Hotel, but you'd be wrong.  What's cool about this HRC is the massive guitar/sign at the entrance.  I wish I knew the guy who went to five years of architect school for that one.  I recall getting a macaroni and cheese that came with some type of toast or garlic bread.  It was tasty enough and the server kept my coke filled, which is really a pet peeve when that doesn't happen.  I watched Stevie Ray Vaughn and Aerosmith videos.  I got a t-shirt on the way out."}
{"text":"I had the salmon a mashed potatoes  Was very good got a lot more then I could eat was not very pricey, for me and my gf both to eat pretty good it came to almost 50$ I'd certainly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"God knows I don't like chain restaurants but we needed a place to take kids before an event at the Q.  Truth be told, the honey mustard grilled chicken sandwich was pretty darn tasty.  The fries were good, too.  Baked beans were good.  Service, eh, major miss.  I had to fall down the host and ask who our server was but nice she arrived she was pleasant and speedy."}
{"text":"We were here to see KINCH play and they really did am outstanding job. We drove to Phoenix from California and it was worth it. We will definitely be seeing them when they are in a closer venue. OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"Have just learned that this Hard Rock is gonna close so I wanna leave my comments. I have come here ever since I was a little boy. One of my favourite Hard Rock Cafe's, one I always visited when in Toronto. The service has always been great, the food awesome and the music just like what you expect from a Hard Rock. Farewell old friend we've shared some great memories!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th time At this Hard Rock Cafe on Vegas. As soon as I land from any I come here every time. It's a chain location but the food has always been on point and the beer is cold. I really can't complain.   I only fly direct from NY to Vegas. When I land I like my first dinner to be all ready and set up. I stay at the cosmopolitan every time. But I love a good burger. In Vegas why not spoil your self to a burger?!  The night of when I land. My promoter told me about this hardtack deal.  I get the $25 per person deal at the hard rock. This includes.  VIP seating (no lines, priority seating) VIP special menu Beer is included  Desert of my choice    The best part is it's pre paid. there is indoor and outdoor seating so you can sit inside or outside. If you choose outside there is a great view of the strip.  I recommend sitting outside.   I enjoy knowing my food and my guests meal is already paid for the first night in Vegas. From the cosmo I take a car to the hard rock. It's a bit of a walk. The staff is always top notch. I have never had bad service here. Last year I even used my $25 deal at the bar.  I still had great service.   Overall I recommend this Hard Rock Cafe to anyone. The food is always consistent for a chain. The VIP is a nice additive. I have been very impressed with the service so far. I will continue to come for this deal when I land in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Wow piss poor service. My wife wanted to sit outside so we asked to and they took us outside they had one table that was dirty so we were told to go back to the host stand and wait 5 to 6 minutes as we waited One of the servers moved one of her guest to the table we were waiting for. I went back to the host stand said that we have been waiting for that table that they just gave to somebody else. The server that was standing at the host stand at that moment gave me dirty looks like I was a moron. The host went out there talk to the table for a few seconds and came back out to me and told me we don't have a table for you. I was asking for an exclamation of why they had no table for me the server got an extreme attitude and started to smart off so I asked him for the manager. The manager was no help I feel like he was just patronizing me \"oh my how does that happen\" what a complete joke and on top of all that I had to waste $10 for parking"}
{"text":"When you have a waitress/waiter that has been at their job for so many years they get lazy.  When a menu says \"vegetables\" and they serve only a \"vegetable\" (singular) then change the menu or compensate the customer with another vegetable like the menu says.  $5 for a side vegetable is a joke.  Some people are lazy, some places suck."}
{"text":"Went there last year after watching the Suns game. Terrible food. Terrible service. Really cool inside, they have some awesome stuff. Its clean and the musician was bada$$. But I ordered a burger well done with no pink. It came out so pink it was almost bloody. I complained and the waiter was arguing with me that its still good. I reminded him the customer is always right. He returned with a new burger just as bad. Also only had 1 refill the whole time I was there."}
{"text":"Decided to go here since we didn't know Diablos Cantina stopped serving food after 10, I'm really glad we came. The four of us decided on the sirloin medium well and it was delicious. Had a great view from the balcony outside, our server was really on point and super nice. Really enjoyed our meal here."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago I was in Vegas for a wedding,  I met up with a friend , i tought this place was great . However I was very dissapointed with the bartenders,  I was alone for about an hour and  wanted to get  some drinks .  I sat at the bar there were 4 bartenders walking around and not one asked if I wanted a drink,  they only approached the bigger groups . I had to waive one down and he gave me my change and says have a great day and ran off, you would think he was off but nope he ignored me completely.   The next drink I waived another bartender down  (while sitting at the bar a few feet from several bartenders)  . I ordered a drink wAnted to open a tab they said okay but brought my card back again saying have a nice day . I was so annoyed with the treatment I was receiving,  I too very well and I can afford my drinks I was very upset a obout being overlooked who knows why.  I had to ask.again  can I open a tab and they finally did , the bartender that came in took care of my friend and I.  However I can't believe with so many bartenders you are ignored like you can't afford to be there so let me get others who look like they can .  I don't think I will be coming back here plenty of bars  in the strip. I will be taking my business somewhere else. I do not need special treatment I just wanted a drink and to be acknowledged."}
{"text":"Guys this place needs to be refreshed!  Food is just ok, and they are missing some of their great salads.  The music is great but you are missing the mark on the food.  And just one small simple thing............clean the front glass doors!"}
{"text":"The Hard Rock Cafe's seem to get hard reviews.   It is a standard chain but I find the food pretty good, well portioned and the service is friendly.   I try to make a stop to as many Hard Rock's as I like the souvenir shops and collect the mugs from each city.  The Twister Mac and Cheese was great and this location is in the heart of downton Toronto."}
{"text":"I had the honey mustard chicken and my wife had the shrimp plate. Good wasn't bad. Cost was around $100. Mainly because of the drinks. Typical themed food."}
{"text":"Toad the bartender served us a great meal. Best server we've had in Vegas"}
{"text":"First I really like HRC in general, this one in particular is very nice, great location and love the decor (guitars in the ceiling, very cool). The service is great, very friendly and speedy.  The food I really like, we had the chicken wings for starters, latter a salad and a bbq chicken that was a little under cook (but was promptly fixed by our server)."}
{"text":"Awful service literally took them 15 minutes for them to acknowledge us and to take our order and on top of that it took 30 minutes for our food when the place was empty."}
{"text":"Let me first say, I'm just not a big fan of these chain restaurants.  We came here only b'c a friend of ours is a huge fan.  The service was decent enough.  We had a rough start regarding seating but in the end it all worked out.  We found a bug in one of our cocktails but the manager comp-ed my friend's and my drink.  That is decent enough.  I got that \"small\" burger they have.  Meat was a step above over cooked.  Hubby got some kind of salad and he liked it.  My fries tasted like it was fried in really old oil.  The whole experience wasn't terrible but I can't justify giving it 3 stars.    Nice location though."}
{"text":"To do a carry out order, you have to go to the bar. I waited about 35 minutes for a hamburger. No offer of a glass of water or anything. The burger was OK. Not as well done as I had asked. No napkins in the bag.   Only pluses to this restaurant is the big paper bag, the easy walk from the Red Roof hotel and no cigarette smell like the casino next door."}
{"text":"We got there early so there was plenty of seating and fast service. Our waitress was amazing and super friendly. The food was good but not fantastic. The live band was fun and energetic but I wish they played more Rock songs instead of just covers of Top 40 pop music. Only taking off one star because we ordered the most basic of bar drinks, a vodka tonic, and it was absolutely terrible and flat."}
{"text":"Was here for a private event w/open bar. Liked the cover band that was performing on the concert stage, which has a decent-sized dancefloor. Bartenders were fun and make decent drinks.   Love the large upstairs patio with seating - overlooks the Strip, fantastic view."}
{"text":"It's possible they were having a bad day, but our service SUCKED!  We were seated right away, but it was 20 minutes before we decided to flag someone down to try and order.  The waitress was helpful, but it was clear there was some confusion that day because not too much later another table near us also had to flag someone down so they could order.  In the end we had two different people attending to us, which made it unclear who would be getting our tip.  The food was fine but over priced.  In the end we were there two hours, and not because we wanted to be."}
{"text":"Came here tonight it was a Sunday and fairly busy, not a long wait , staff was nice.  Order appitizer chicken tenders they were awesome also there BBQ sauce is some of the most unique I've ever had and I love BBQ sauce!   Other legend burger was good it was medium rare to rare even tho I got medium . it tatsted very good and was quality meat or I would been pissed haha   Loved this place"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I visited the Hard Rock Cafe on the way to a party hosted upstairs in the bar.  Megan was our server and she is also known as Jacked & Tan.  I orderd the Chop Salad to get some healthy food in my system before a night of flipcup. The service was quick for a Thursday night. The employees have a great sense of humor.  I should mention that it was pretty cold sitting outside at 7:30pm on a Thursday in October.  The weather was a little cooler than previous years and while it looks nice to set outside in the evening, if you are from Southern California be sure to bring a sweater.  An hour or so later, I had polished off the salad and it was a good time to grab a beer and watch the band for the night.  Definitely a great place to have an event at, enjoy some food, make some new friends at, and skip the club drama."}
{"text":"Always liked the Hard Rock chain, but perhaps they are not as special as they used to be. There are a lot of other restaurants around just as good. Seems to me that there a lot of great places to get a really good burger now, it certainly wasn`t the case 20 years ago. But now it seems to be Red Robin at twice the price. Still good, but not great, and getting quite pricey in comparison to the competition like Rehab, Red Robin, and Cold beers and Cheeseburgers etc. There even seemed to be less memorabilia inside."}
{"text":"Not as good as other Hard Rock Cafe I already was. The food wasn't tasty at all and surely will not come once again here to eat anything.  The local itself quite nice and service was good. Nice place to get for a drink or two."}
{"text":"2.7 stars - average food, good service, zero atmosphere.   Came here with a large group for work - was sadly empty on a Thurs. evening - felt  like a family restaurant ....   Wings were average, nothing to rave about - nachos were slightly better. Smokehouse chopped salad was fresh and a good break from the Vegas usual. Drink menu is fruity cocktails, on the too-sweet side. Service was prompt and efficient, but other than convenience/service, no compelling reason to frequent this cafe unless you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hard Rock cafe' all around the world and this is the WORSE ever. Just don't eat here! Food it's gross and disgusting and if you want to eat a good plat of food you have to order more than 3 meals! I don't eat a lot but with an appetizer and a meal I wasn't full at all! Waiters were rude and the place smelled a lot.  I'm never going here again"}
{"text":"Great breakfast........our server Dana was fabulous. French Toast was a little undercooked but the manager made it right....we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So there are 2 Hard Rock Cafes in Las Vegas: one on The Strip, and this one at the corner of Paradise and Harmon.  To make things more confusing, this Hard Rock is NOT in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, but is a separate structure in front of it (and surrounded by the Hotel's driveway).  Got it?    Ok, now that we know where we are, let's go in.  The decor is typical of every Hard Rock there is: rock memorabilia (mostly guitars) mounted on the walls with plaques identifying the musician who once used it, and many TV's featuring rock videos.  It felt fresh and exciting in New York in the 1980's; now it seems tame and stale.  Maybe that's why I was the only patron who was not 1) elderly, or 2) dining with small children.    I was greeted promptly and cheerfully by the hosts, and they offered me a seat at the bar, which I took.  I had slept in too late and so I missed the bacon egg and cheese croissant I had been craving (breakfast ends at 11 AM).  Instead I decided to go safe and order the Legendary Burger.    My bartender also had tables he was in charge of serving, so he was gone a lot.  Watching him work, he had a tendency to get task-saturated: he would keep running back and forth to whatever table had asked him for something last, rather than taking care of multiple parties in sweeps.  I finally just went to the server station and had him refill my drink from the soda gun.    The food was fine.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad, either.  The price seemed a little steep, but 1) this is a tourist-trap, and 2) check in with Yelp yields a 20% discount on food and non-alcoholic drinks, so that was nice.    Conclusions: this place is fine; neither great nor terrible."}

{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at this location in Pittsburgh- actually, I was close to stunned by how good my food was. Typically, one goes to the Hard Rock for the experience, for the venue, for the music, and for fairly decent bar food. On the contrary, my experience here this weekend was all about the good food. I had the vegetarian burger, which can equipped with portobello mushroom, a huge grilled red pepper as well as some other grilled veggies. The flavor was incredible- I'm sure that I tasted a hint of steak sauce. At first, I bit into the burger and I thought the portobello was actual steak (I'm a vegetarian, so I was somewhat worried)- that was how good the flavor was. The fries were well above par as well, along with the coleslaw, which I typically don't even like. The service was not great and everything was overpriced ($13 for veggie burger and fries and $3.50 for a soda), however I need to let them off the hook because it's Hard Rock and the food definitely rocks! I'm not in Station Square often, but I need to stop in here again."}
{"text":"Usually for a chain restaraunt the Hard Rock is pretty good. Well this time around we go to the Rock for a late dinner and order the spinach artichoke dip. They are suppose to come with pita bread, but guess what....they are out of the pita bread and the waitress doesn't tell us but assumes that nacho chips are ok. Well, guess what....nacho chips tastes vastly different than pita bread. Since we were hungry we ate it but really?!?! Don't just assume that a substitution is OK. Very disappointed with this one"}
{"text":"We wanted to get out of the heat!  Perfect place for that.  Music non-stop!  Music video on TV on each booth!  The food was great! Our waiter was always coming back to check on us.  When we come back to Vegas we will definitely com here again!!"}
{"text":"Well, we thought we'd give this place another shot since we live close by.  We should have went to our local dive like always. Our server a month ago was good.  Today,  not so much.  She kept walking by but had yet to refill my beverage(bout 10 minutes empty). Dinner came before  I received a refill.  She continued to do her stare at us as she walked by and my fiancé wad in need of a drink too be this point.  She never asked if he wanted another beer until we were finished with dinner.    The food was delicious this time.  The pulled pork was so tender. The mac n cheese with chicken was delicious too.  The food is the only reason we are giving 2 stars.   We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a Relient K concert with the girlfriend and I have to say that I enjoyed this venue more than others I've visited. We thought we were gonna be cool chilling on the 21+ bar area on sofas while enjoying the concert, which we did, but they had seating for those who wanted to sit at any age. The bartender was also really nice and friendly. I was pretty pleased that it wasn't dirty and that I didn't have to stand for 4 hours to hear a band I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Same average food tourist trap as all the other Hard Rocks I've been to.   This place is really, really small. They do make really good drinks though. What really pissed me off was every time I went to the bar to get a drink I kept getting carded. I know I look young, but damn! I am over thirty!   What this place has going for it is location and that's about it.   Go to The Melting Pot instead, you'll be much happier!"}
{"text":"Always have amazing service and awesome food! Parking is available in various lots and garages for a fee. Although Cleveland's location is not as elaborate as the Vegas or Myrtle Beach locations it's still got a very cool collection."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for a quick snack and drinks. It took forever to get drinks then the same for the food. We we then asked for the check the wait was unbelievable. We have been to Hardrocks all over the world.  This was by far the worst"}
{"text":"I always get excited to go to Hard Rock and then am disappointed when I sit down and figure out that there really isn't anything special about these restaurants... Standard Hard Rock. Same overpriced menu. We stopped by after the symphony to grab a bite.  Our waitress was pretty lackluster. None of the items around the restaurant peaked our interest. Ate and left. Would not recommend - there are plenty of other options around this area to try first."}
{"text":"We celebrated New Year's Eve here and attended their party.  The party was fantastic and well worth the $175pp. It included an open bar, appetizers, band/DJ, and a relaxing but energetic way to experience NYE with great views of the Las Vegas Strip. Lisa from sales answered all of my questions about the party. The entire staff was phenomenal and hard working. They let the crowd in 30 min early which was appreciated. My wife and I will remember this event for many years."}
{"text":"For a few days, the Hard Rock Cafe was Yelp's base camp for checking into Yelp Spring Break. Upon entering, the 1st floor is all merch. Virtually any conceivable trinket, souvenir, or swag emblazoned with the Hard Rock Cafe logo is down there somewhere.  Yelp's check-in & the \"cafe\" portion of Hard Rock Cafe were upstairs. With checking into YSB came voucher tickets for a free Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktail at the Hard Rock Cafe bar. Go to the bar for a free drink? Don't gotta ask me twice...  So, the girlfriend & I sidled up to the bar. Service was extremely friendly & we got our cocktails in a jiffy. While sipping our refreshingly free drinks, we noticed a small menu of items specifically for Yelp: Pork Belly Sliders, Braised Short Rib Tacos & Fried Stuffed Jalapenos.  I ordered all 3 to sample. Our food was taking a while, but our bartender went back to check it out & we had our order shortly after. The Tacos & the Jalapenos were excellent, flavorful, nicely spicy & were served with knockout delicious dipping sauces. Comparatively, the Pork Belly Sliders were a little bland.  All 3 dishes were tapa-sized, so there was room for dessert. We got the Caramel Xango. Oh. My. God! Now that alone was worth walking into the building for. Cheesecake wrapped in tortilla, deep-fried, & then served with whipped cream + caramel & strawberry sauces drizzled all over everything. Wow.  While chewing & sipping, we took in the Hard Rock ambiance. Lots of glass & steel with plenty music memorabilia throughout. It's pretty cool. For the most part the food was pretty good too & service was top notch. After squaring the tab, we exited the same way we came in, through the gift shop."}
{"text":"Try the hurricane or the Long Island iced tea and you won't be disappointed. Live music tonight acoustic guitar very nice. Until at least 10 on a Saturday night so come prepared for that. If there are no games close by finding parking is not a problem. Javi is our server and is very attentive and fun. I would recommend the Hard Rock Phoenix especially if there is not a game or something going on."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. My first time here was for a coworker's retirement party and she was thrilled this was the place we chose. The food was excellent for me. Can't go wrong with twisted mac and cheese! Even though our party was big, the servers got to everyone quickly and efficiently. Would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"First, the hostess was rude, and had us line up like cattle. She didn't take our names, and others were seated before us who came in after we did.  We get to a table, which was dirty.  Silverware had caked on food. Glasses had lipstick rings in the rim. I ordered mac and cheese, and it was $16.00. The tab was 55 for 2 adults with 1 drink from the bar, all for awful service, and crap food. The memorabilia is nice. Otherwise, I'd not waste my time or money again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate two times here on our trip to Las Vegas.  The first time was around 10pm on a Monday night.  It was a little slower so our waitress was very attentive.  The food came out fast and was absolutely delicious.  I had the Original Legendary Burger, my husband had the pulled pork sandwich.  They give plenty of fries and we left fuller than full.  We also got specialty drinks.  They don't list prices of those on the menu... and we found out they are pretty pricey (around $14 each) but very tasty.  The second time we came it was during the regular dinner service.  It was busy and our server wasn't around much.  Food was still pretty good though."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a patron of chain restaurants, but I went to Hard Rock Cafe downtown last week to see a local band, Super Stereo, perform there.  And actually, up until I bought the tickets for the show, I didn't even know Hard Rock allowed local bands to perform there.  That's pretty cool of them, and I respect that.  The beer selection was mediocre at best, the mushroom and swiss burger was tasty, and the server was kind and attentive.  I couldn't ask much more from Hard Rock so I won't.  If you're downtown and need a bite to eat, there are several better joints to check out.  However, if you have a specific reason to go to Hard Rock (like I did), go there and enjoy yourself.  You'll have a good time.  Oh, and Super Stereo kicked butt!  Check them out!!"}
{"text":"Ate here and saw the Dandy Warhols here. Dinning experience was mediocre. Venue for concert was pretty damm good!"}
{"text":"So I had a craving for a salad, so I decided to head to Hard Rock Cafe.  I ordered the Haystack Salad with Grilled Chicken.  It was okay, nothing for me to run back and get again.  Went to the bar, service sucks.  It wasn't packed or busy and the waitress was not attentive.  I would've thought she would ask if I wanted something to drink while I wait for my take out or something (that's what I would've done) but she didn't...no smile, no \"customer service\"...nothing.  Maybe I was expecting too much, lol."}
{"text":"The 2nd time was even better.  Great food and great service.  Try the chicken club."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Service took a tad long when we ate dinner but nothing too bad. Also was start of our bar crawl the following night so we started with drinks there. Nice atmosphere the outside seating has a beautiful view of the strip, it was cold when we went but would love to eat out there any other time. Worth a stop in if you pass by and hungry."}
{"text":"- not being a fan of franchises and tourist traps, i wanted to report on the fact that this location has a really great space on the 2nd floor that appears to only be used for private functions and small/intimate concerts - was here a couple of weeks ago for a japan tsunami relief fundraiser, and was blown away by the venue space."}
{"text":"Three stars because they have similar food to other Hard Rock Cafes. Also, we got a sampler to split among like 5 of us and there weren't enough chips for the dip. The fries that I got were the right level of spicy and super yummy. I would get those again in a heart beat. I would also need some water with them. They were some sort of spicy fry seasoning with some chili ketchup. Would highly recommend them. Downside to the menu, if you are practicing Catholic and it's Lent DO NOT COME HERE. There are only like 6 options on the menu for you and most of them are expensive. I would save this for another night during Lent if I could have.  One star for being able to cater to a large group. We were a group of about 12. So it was kind of nice that they could get us all seated pretty fast. Though, with such a large group you would think coming around with the water jug from time to time would be good. I had to wait for a really long time to get my water refilled. Which is highly unusual at any sort of restaurant. Usually they are fast about it. Not this time though. I think at one point I had to flag the guy down for some more water.   Overall, not bad. Not great, but not bad."}
{"text":"The staff were a little rude when we attended an event at Hard Rock Live on the Strip."}
{"text":"We were looking for a laid back casual place to eat lunch on the Strip.  We liked the Hard Rock at other places we've been (Orlando & San Francisco) so we figured we'd give it a try. It's the usual high prices of Hard Rock (ouch!). They take your picture before you can get a table. I really didn't appreciate this. We all looked like crap after a long day walking the Strip, and my daughter has some sensory issues that cause her to not like situations like that. I didn't like being forced into that. It would be nice if they *asked* if you wanted your picture, not corralled you into the picture station right after the hostess station.  So after the picture taking, we then got hounded by our waiter to join some VIP club. No thanks, I'm here to eat. After we got hounded by the waiter, we got hounded by another girl who brought our pictures to our table and wanted us to buy them. Thanks but no thanks, they look awful and I'm dropping too much on dinner anyways. I really just wanted to be left alone to enjoy my meal, but I couldn't! I do like the Hard Rock atmosphere, with the music & the memorabilia.   The twisted mac n chicken n cheese was no where NEAR as good as the same meal I got in San Francisco. I don't know what went wrong there. For $20, it better be fabulous, and it just wasn't at all."}
{"text":"A good late night meal option in Vegas.  Tasty, clean food. Ordered the cauliflower patty veg burger which comes with fries. It was delicious !! I wasn't informed prior to the bill that avocado doesn't come with burger and will be extra charge.  There need to be cheaper drink options without the souvenir keeping glass gifts I don't want to carry in luggage."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast the other day. Food was good and the service was excellent and quick!  Food: 4 Service: 5  Overall: 4.5 rounds down"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Nice atmosphere. Service was 'ok'. This wad our first hard rock experience.  We would return. :)"}
{"text":"from the moment we walked in this place was a good choice. Jeff seated us and was hysterical.  he really was a great guy. then we were served by Ronnie and she was fantastic. she suggested our drinks and our food based on what we said we liked. everything came out wonderful. the food was great. the manager on duty for sat. the 11th of October was also great. she was very helpful and attentive. great job guys!"}
{"text":"This is a Hard Rock Cafe and you will find, feel and eat whatever you expect from a Hard Rock Cafe. They have nice burgers, sandwiches, several appetizers, etc., various drinks and tasty lemonades (my basil lemonade was soooo good and refreshing, I would drink 20 of those one after the other :) ).  It is true that, if you focus only on the food, it is a bit overpriced. Thing is, I love rock music, I love burgers and sandwiches, aaaand this is a great combination of both."}
{"text":"We decided to bring our friend here since it's a tradition of hers to go to every Hard Rock location there is.  It was 11:30am when we stopped by on Saturday and people were starting to trickle in. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly. She took us to our seats and informed us she was going to be our waitress as well.   The menu has many different choices and the drinks are endless. Most of the drinks come with a souvenir cup so they are definitely worth it!   I ended up ordering the buffalo chicken wings with a side of the parmesan and garlic fries. I spent about $18.  The parmesan garlic fries were to die for!!! These are a must have! Oh and make sure to ask for ranch to dip them in! The wings (6 in the order) were so juicy and big! These wings were not at all tiny!   Our waitress was very friendly and patient! She checked up on us several times and always made sure we had what we wanted.   The decor is pretty cool inside and the bathrooms were very clean. Oh and the toilets are black! Yes black."}
{"text":"Been to a few Hard Rocks and they are pretty much the same. Had the Mac and Cheese. Still not as good as Rock Bottom's Mac/Cheese. Great service but had to walk around the building to go into the casino."}
{"text":"I ate there twince last month, and it was a Good Experience. The Wait Staff was Exceptional! Both times they were Friendly, and Provided Good Service. The Food is Good Quality, and the Location is in the Heart of what is Toronto's \"Times Square.\" I will go back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent service. Expensive beer but it is Las Vegas. Cool place to check out."}
{"text":"My first time here was for the iamsu concert, and I must say, I'm pretty impressed. There is a lot of dance room, and the bar was hardly crowded. They have good security, breaking up fights tight when it started. Employees are friendly and helpful, and bathrooms are clean and tidy. Overall, I had a great experience. Only reason why I gave it only 4 stars was because there are a lot of barriers when you wanna get around the club, and also for it being on the 3rd floor."}
{"text":"We visit all the \"cool\" places when we go on Vacation. Our favorite place to visit is Arizona because I used to live there AND because we live in MI now and it's cold all the time! We were staying in Scottsdale and had a very hard time finding this Hard Rock Cafe. We finally arrived only to wait about one and half hours to be seated. We were not even there at a \"rush\" time; or not that one would think it would be. We arrived about 4pm or so and still had the long wait. I wanted a T-shirt from there because I collect them from every \"Hard Rock\" cafe that we visit!    So we finally got seated and I wanted this 4 cheese Lasagna that they have at every one of these chain restaurants. I did get it but it was a bit on the smaller size in appearance and taste and on the larger side in price. I'm not so sure it was worth the long drive, the wait time and then the meal wasn't quite satisfying.  But to defend this classic spot, I have to say that the atmosphere, of course, was rockin! There was some great memorabilia to look at and alot of things to buy at the little store...if you could \"squeeze\" in amoung the crowds!!     I guess I would say if you are a fan of \"Hard Rocks\" then you should go, because this  \"IS\" the Phoenix one.  The food is about the same as all the others but like I said, it seemed a bit on the \"smaller\" side in portion. I still always enjoy trying the new places out and the old ones and checking out all of the Hard Rock's to see what kind of paraphanalia they have hanging around.."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for the weekend (10/22 & 23). Wanted to watch the Steelers game and we were already at Station Square.  First, we went into Buckheads, but the menu was very limited. So, we left to walk across the bridge into downtown and find someplace else, but Hard Rock Cafe is right there so we popped in, made sure the game would be on, and got a table.   First off - our first server was really nice. Very accommodating. I was really interested in trying the Buffalo Cauliflower \"wings\".  But, she came back and said they were out. So, I just went with a Caeser Salad with grilled Salmon.  Had to send it back because the salad was way too salty. I love salt, but this was overkill. I kept the Salmon and even though I ate the whole piece of Salmon, the server took everything off of my bill.  Pretty cool! Her shift was over and we got a new server. He was just as nice and accommodating as the first one. So, really, the servers were not the issue at all.  I waited until the second half of the game and my niece and I decided to share the Hot Fudge Brownie. It looked so damn good on the menu. But, we were gypped. It comes in a very large glass bowl, but there was barely a scoop of ice cream, no hot fudge and an ENORMOUS amount of whipped cream. I mean, really enormous. I'm sure they did that to hide the super small amount of ice cream. And, honest to god, whipped cream is my favorite dessert, but I would have preferred the actual ice cream that should have been in the bowl.  There's even a picture on this page while I'm typing this and ours looked NOTHING like what's in that picture.  Oh, and we noticed that a woman who came in about 40 minutes after we did was able to get the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings.  SMH! The kitchen staff at this one is damaging their business. Now I know why it wasn't very busy.   After eating at a few local restaurants all weekend and being pleased, then settling for Hard Rock Cafe because it was right in front of us, we learned our lesson: next time, we'll stick to the plan and avoid chain restaurants like this one."}
{"text":"Burger & milkshakes are yummy!  Our waitress Butter was AWESOME!  Worth going just for her!  She performs, cranks the music & gets the entire restaurant singing. So much fun!!!"}
{"text":"I've usually fared about average when it comes to food at any Hard Rock I've ever been to, so I wasn't waiting for high dollar cuisine. I ordered the \"rockin' wings\" and boy were they every bit of that name. They had a good punch to them and were cooked to perfection....I make some great wings at home which I will never divulge what goes on them - LOL - but these were so good, my wife even compared them to the ones from home and she never does that! i was definitely impressed and would love to order a larger size the next time I'm in town. The ambiance of sitting on the patio by the strip is a definite must if you're wiling to brave the Vegas breeze at night or the heat during the day. The nightlife is the best because of everything that's going on down below!"}
{"text":"This a sports bar not a hard rock cafe.  Bad all around ... bad food, bad service, bad ambience (ie total sports bar)"}
{"text":"Why do people come here?  The atmosphere?  Fine.  The music and the paraphernalia are kinda cool.  Aside from that? They have nothing going for them.    We arrived just after one pm and the restaurant was half empty.  We were given a four person square table, but since we had a child, we asked for one of the rounded banquette booths.  There were two available but just weren't cleared yet.  This was asking a bit much.  We were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  Are you kidding me?  Just to clear and wipe down a table would take that long?  Alright, we're here, we will wait it out.  What we found surprising was that a couple of other groups came in (one group of at least eight people) were told they would have to sit at separate tables.  Are you serious?  People, the restaurant was honestly half empty!  They couldn't push two tables together to accommodate these paying guests?  Way to send business out the door (literally).  Our server was very good.  I gave an extra star for that.  Although she took awhile to acknowledge us in the first place, once we ordered, she was very courteous.  She checked up on us at least three times and was efficient.    The food was pretty average.  The wings were kinda dry, not saucy either.  I liked the potato chips, but why not separate them so they remain crisp, not used as a bed for the wings so they get soggy?  Why cut the celery and carrots into slices when it would be much easier to leave them as sticks?  The best thing on the combo platter was probably the chicken tenders and the onion rings.  Those spring rolls were just plain sad.  Tiny and cheap on filling.  Potato skins were ok I guess.  The kid liked the pasta with side salad and milk.  The five year old was happy.    How has this place lasted for so long?  The world renowned branding factor.  Basically, it's a tourist trap."}
{"text":"The food was better than any other hard rock I have been to. The food took longer than expected but it was a busy afternoon. The memorabilia is worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"Review for the shop only. I'm a pinhead.  They have one of the largest offerings of pins. I always like coming in here to look at their pins and they have pins they are trying to get rid of on sale but they're not the best looking pins.  There is a lot of foot traffic at this store because it's on the strip. Show your AAA card and you get 10% off your purchase."}
{"text":"Bonne musique, service efficace, portions géantes. Great restaurant ! Avec une magnifique vue à l'étage sur le monte Carlo et al grande roue. Terrasse parfaite par beau temps. Je recommande vivement cet établissement.  Goodies à vendre dans la boutique en dessous du restaurant."}
{"text":"5 star rating because of our waitress Amy. In all honesty probably the best server ive ever had, anywhere. Great service, great personality. She seemed to really enjoy interacting with our 8 month old the whole time we were there. To top it off she got us a complimentary dessert for my mom's 50th birthday and our wedding that day. Just an overall awesome experience, food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"A nice store located right by their Eason Shopping mall and Yonge Dundas Square which is like a mini-NYC Times Square.  Most of these HRC stores are very tiny now.  Jennifer, the clerk who assisted me was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"A solid 4. Lots of food which seems to be pretty rare these days. The \"Legendary Local\" burger is awesome. The Twisted Mac&Cheese is off the chain. The place is a little cramped, and the music is so loud it's hard to think let alone talk. A definite must if you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Great food, great location! Mediocre service in the bar seating area. Would recommend anyone who plans to not actually sit at the bar or order drinks request to be seated in the main dining area. Seating otherwise (in this day) gets forgotten about resulting in slow service and the music, although great, is too loud it is difficulty to have a conversation. Typical Hard Rock location, awesome displays of memorabilia and classic music videos playing on the screen in the booth seating. Meatloaf brings back so many memories.... overall still a favorite restaurant of mine but for the vegetarians the options are few, good luck."}
{"text":"Touristy, yes... tourist trap? No. As far as touristy places go, this particular Hard Rock wins. I can't remember the last time we had such great service. Like, anywhere. Not only was our waitress phenomenal, informed, helpful and friendly, the manager even came by and had very personable, genuine conversation. We had Four adults and four kids, including two infants, and yet they still treated us like stars (yay!) They brought out a huge dessert after we had paid, just because. ?! I've never seen something like that. Oh, and one of my kids wanted an egg to eat, and they actually just fried up one (which wound up being three, I think) for her. A lot of places won't do that (sad, but true.)  So I'll spare you the description since I'm sure most people are aware of what Hard Rocks are like, but you can definitely count on great service and good food (the kids meals were fantastic too.) With all the potentially horrendous tourist experiences in Vegas, this is a sure bet. Highly, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, food was good, so was customer service. Had a good time and they do have pretty cool memorabilia at this location."}
{"text":"In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. I find it funny that this place is advertised on yelp under \"Canadian\" I am Canadian and the food is more American than it is Canadian, especially in portions, menu items and preparation. The food is so so, however, I'm in it for the museum aspect of it and the cool rock star casino chips that you can buy at the cash out booth. I like looking at rock memorabilia. I am a bit of a music junkie to be honest, therefore, seeing cool guitars, costumes etc is a cheap free entertainment aspect on the strip. It's not actually on the Strip but slightly on the outskirts, almost a 20 minute walk. Our waitress was friendly and the prices were decent for what it was."}
{"text":"Atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty cool, especially if you're a fan of rock music with the signed guitars and other items from famous rock bands. The food is pretty good, nothing super special, but consistent in flavor. I ordered The Texan, a bbq pulled pork sandwich with fried onion straws and jalapenos and cheddar cheese. It was a good sized sandwich with plenty of meat and toppings. The bbq sauce sort of overwhelmed the rest of the flavors, which I found somewhat disappointing. The dish also came with coleslaw, beans, and fries. The coleslaw and beans were average, the fries were too salty and some were a bit soggy. Overall, prices are also higher than I would expect for the quality of food and options in comparison to other restaurants that serve similar menu items."}
{"text":"Horrible. Called room service at 9:15, no one answered phone until 9:25. Horrible place. Stay anywhere else. Me and my friends got five rooms and terrible service all around. Spend money on a hotel that's worth it. It's a cab ride from the strip and not worth hanging around otherwise.  I could not imagine ranch dressing being anymore watered down."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The memorabilia alone is worth stopping in for. The service was great and super friendly. This was the first place I had a burger in the US of A. I didn't understand  what they meant when the asked how I wanted the burger done. But they knew I was Canadian when I said fully done! Since then I have started to love medium rare burgers! Anywho I didn't pay so not sure the cost but it is Vegas so likely over priced. However if you like Rock, worth the visit!"}
{"text":"We ended up eating outside as it was our first night in Vegas and we wanted to take it all in.  I ordered a shrimp caesar salad that was awesome.  Don't remember what my boyfriend had but he enjoyed his too.  The service was friendly and accommodating!  It was pretty chilly outside so they moved the tables around so we would be warm and under one of the outdoor heaters."}
{"text":"Ate with a large group and they were very accommodating. The food was good but not great."}
{"text":"No customer service, in Las Vegas We have visited various Hard Rock Cafes, but this one has the worst customer service. We were not even acknowledged, let alone given the opportunity to be served. We walked out."}
{"text":"MUSIC VENUE. Since I was in town I wasn't going to miss the Black Dahlia Murder playing at the HRC 3rd floor concert venue. The place is perfect to get up close to the bands you love most and the sound system is just right. The big bar offers beer on tap at regular prices that most bars on the Strip charge."}
{"text":"Aweful. Everyone is confused. I watched wait staff carry around food. Manager was on where to be seen. You would expect better on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Shout out to Mark, jean Marie, Brenda and Eddy who went out of their way to help my nephew and I enjoy a dinner meal together after I signed up for the hard rock rewards and there was a snafu with an email for a free entree. Thanks for making our Vegas visit ROCK AT THE HARD ROCK!!"}
{"text":"saw thrice perform their farewell tour here.  really awesome concert venue. spacious. not overcrowded and stage is situated that everyone is able to see everything!  hope to attend more concerts here in the future."}
{"text":"I went to the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe for lunch on a Friday. It wasn't very busy, so I figured I would sit at the bar. The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly.   But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa!   My other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm!   I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously.   It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation.  It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals!   So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit.   Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too, I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area.   Before this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well. But just as the music we call Rock has deteriorated so has this conglomeration! So long fair well HRC, I withdraw my support of you."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a required stop whenever I visit Vegas. The service is stellar, and the quality and the taste of the food is quite simply amazing (and so was alcoholic beverages). I couldn't say kinder words about our waiter, it seems as though that the people working at this location have a true passion at doing the job they were hired to do. I was also impressed with the environment in general, it's very clean and decorated incredibly well, there's always good (although loud) music playing, and sometimes non-mainstream artists perform live as well, which is a treat to catch. If you're visiting Vegas, you have to give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"HRC is a great option and one of the mainstays in Station Square.  Excellent outdoor seating option with a superb city view.  And they do a great job at bringing in acts.  PS:  Food/Drinks are the standard Hard Rock experience, certainly good!"}
{"text":"This place has three levels. The first floor is the gift shop, second floor is the restaurant/bar, and the third floor looked like the place they have live entertainment at. My group just went for a very late dinner. The hostess saw that I was on crutches so she tried to seat me and my party somewhere close so I didn't have to walk to far, which is awesome since I've had people do the exact opposite in the past. The waiter that we had was very friendly and provided great customer service...and he was pretty cute =). The food was average. It was a bit of a disappointment to be honest with you but it wasn't terrible. I'd definitely come back again, probably before they're about to close next time hahaha!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took forever to get drinks, then took another 30 mins for our food. Trying to get the bill was another 30 mins. If you have time to kill then come here, otherwise go eat somewhere else.  Positive note.. the view is nice"}
{"text":"Imagine, if you will, that you've just attended an epic rock concert (for purposes of this discussion, let's say it was Alice Cooper and Mötley Crüe). You stroll across the street to a place called Hard Rock Cafe (sort of a brand icon for nearly 45 years; you may have heard of it...), only to be told at 11:45 on a Saturday night, \"We're actually closed now\" (customers within notwithstanding). Thank goodness for the Tilted Kilt Pub a block away, which was actually willing to feed and entertain us until 2:00 AM.  I'd only ever been to one HRC (Lahaina). After this debacle, I won't waste my time ever again.  Edited to say: 1) I appreciate the response from Business Manager Anthony S., and 2) the point was not so much that we were turned away 15 minutes before closing; rather that such an establishment closes 2 hours earlier than all the competition in the area, just as 15k+ potential customers are streaming out of a concert venue right across the street..."}
{"text":"Like any Hard Rock Cafe, i go there to buy a souvenir glass or a t-shirt and avoid the food.  Went there for a \"business\" dinner. Service is OK, food is like an average cafeteria: greasy, food quality is below average, portions are ok.  Free refills for sodas (and water)."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes to get service. When I asked for a drink another 5 minutes went by so I got up and left. There were only 10 people in the place so they weren't overwhelmed with customers. Based on the service it's easy to see why. Parking around this area sucks as well. I feel guilty even leaving 1 star. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place rocks and if you order one of their specialty drinks you get to take the glass home! I had steak nachos big enough to share...it was fresh and my steak was so tender it was perfect... I didn't even have to tell them medium for my steak! You get your pic taken when you first come in and can later purchase if you want of course I did it was 3 pics for $15 not bad!!"}
{"text":"A very nice waitress, very good food.  We were all recovering from the previous night (in Vegas, go figure), so we all needed a lot of water.  The waitress was kind enough to bring us a pitcher of water when one became available and was very sweet.  Of the four people in the party, three of the meals were delicious: blackened chicken pasta (x2) and a legendary burger.  The fourth, a veggie burger was \"not good\".  Otherwise, a fine way to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"I had always walked by this Hard Rock Cafe, but never went in. Came here for someone's birthday and it was okay.  The place was crazy busy and didn't have much room overall. With a dimly lit atmosphere and oldies music playing, it was quite a cool environment to be in. The seating wasn't all that comfortable even though we had quite a few people. We all just had to cram into on section.  The food and drinks were all over priced, and everything seemed mediocre in terms of taste. I didn't get any food personally, but from what I could see, everything seemed quite oily/greasy.  The service was alright, as they were super busy and didn't have the time to accommodate their customers. Not really a place I would go to for dinner on a whim, but a nice atmosphere if you like the music!"}
{"text":"I have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on 2 separate trips to Vegas is the last 4 months.  On both occasions we found ourselves eating here two nights in a row.  The wings are amazing and so is the salad.  Service was always great and nice atmosphere.  Can't find a bad thing to say about the place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, where do I begin. Just the other day I was shopping at Eaton Centre  and was craving the twisted Mac and cheese from here. My friend and I walked over and we were greeted by a cute lady and seated outside on to the patio. Our server came by and he seemed a bit nervous and kept pacing back and forth like he was running a marathon. I already knew what I wanted so I started off with the bruschetta and the twisted Mac and cheese and my friend ended up ordering The Texan sandwich. While we waited for our food,  the server brought out some water and was wiggling around with it and I watched him come to my table spilling half the water on himself. Seriously boy if your hung over, call in sick... like damn. I looked at him and he right away noticed he forgot the lemon for my water and I felt like asking him for another water but clearly the mans going through some issues. About 10 minutes later, he came with a tray full of drinks for the table behind us and dropped off the lemon and then knocked over my knife. He then he went on to the floor to pick it up and everything on his tray started to topple over and spill but he some how prevented disaster haha. Not to mention he made a grunting pig sound... I was appalled. After he dropped off the drinks, he runs over trying to catch his breath and asks me what was my order again..like really bro!?  At this point my friends getting worried that I may snap at any given moment. All I was thinking, I'm ready to powerbomb this guy through the tables. Anyway, shortly after the bruschetta arrives from a different server, I was shocked how small the four pieces were. I've been here many times before and what kind of cut backs are they trying to pull here! Our server came by to ask how the bruschetta was and I had to tell him how I felt, he then told me that they changed their bruschetta recipe six months ago. I was there once before during that time and the bruschetta was excellent, don't know why they feeding me this pinch size of crap. Within 5 minutes our food arrived, I dig into my twisted Mac and it was cold and tasted tangy, nothing like how its suppose to and my friend took a bite out of his sandwich and looked like he was about to cry haha. My friend and I switched our entrées -that made no difference - and his sandwich was cold and the pork was dry, the only thing that tasted good was the side of baked beans that came with it. We didn't touch the food from that point on and I honestly was ready to go ape shit so decided to keep quiet. My friend took the initiative to speak to the server and explained how awful the food tasted. The server immediately apologized and went to inform the manager. The server came back twice in 10 minutes saying the manager was in a meeting. We waited another 10 minutes and the manager struts over and was so rude, it was unbelievable. My friend was doing the talking and he offered to cover the bruschetta and the manager didn't say anything but stare at us. There were a couple of awkward moments of silence, believe it or not. The manager in a disrespectful tone explained how the staff has been working here for the past 20 years and they know what their doing. Then she asked in a hurry, \"anything I can remake for you\", I replied \"no, but I would like a coffee\", she walked off without saying a thing. We waited for 15 minutes not knowing if she was coming back with the coffee or with the bill. What a waste of time! I assumed she wasn't coming back and informed the server we were leaving. As soon as we were crossing the street, the server ran after us and said \"were you guys planning to clear up the bill?\" the manager walked over and said how she can call the cops, I just lost it. At this point the west side came out of me... I was ready to put down my purse and things were about to get ugly. By that time, my innocent friend wanted to avoid something straight out of Compton, and ran inside and paid since he knew it was about to go down. This is the last time I'm dealing with this place and the people who work there. It's unfortunate because in the past I really enjoyed dining here. The manager probably kept the tip and bought herself a couple of hot dogs, knowing the food here is garbage. I have never came across a manager who behaved so poorly with their customers."}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe is one of the best places to chill in while at Station Square; it's comfy, stylish, and always has classic rock music vids and songs playing on the TVs they've set up around the place. I've been here for both lunch and dinner and both times I've left ready to go back and eat another meal (which then never happens just due to the fact that Station Square is a bit of a pain to get to and park in); it had been a few years between my only two visits here, though, so I'm wondering if they changed the menu up since I last ate here. I seem to remember the options in terms of food being a bit smaller during my first visit.   Well, either way, I was happy to find such a varied menu when I returned - burgers, salad, delicious looking sandwiches, fish - my table easily sat in silence for ten minutes just mulling over what we wanted to eat. I settled on a Goat Cheese Chicken Salad Sandwich. I can't say this is something I've seen served at many other places, and it was really, really good. Very unique. It went well with my fantastic berry margarita.   However, an important note about making dinner plans based on my personal preferences - if possible, when you visit or make a reservation, ask in advance if there's going to be a show during your meal. Not so much because the show will be bad and you'll need to avoid it - I mean, it IS called the Hard Rock Cafe - but because, well, if you're looking for a restaurant to just sit, eat and chat with friends, then you need to be prepared for the fact that the Cafe will soon transform from a nice place to do exactly that into a noisy distracting high-class bar. This nearly happened to my group; we had gone to this place specifically to celebrate a friend's birthday, but any time someone tested the mics we couldn't even hear ourselves think. We ran out just before the show started.  But really, I can't hold that against the Cafe, and overall it really is one of the nicest chains to eat at in Pittsburgh. Now maybe I'll find the motivation to make my way back to Station Square to eat here again sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Food is average and overpriced (just like everything in Vegas), but the bottomless Bloody Mary and Mimosas are a great deal at $15! They don't come around very often to refill them, so as soon as they set one down, ask for another."}
{"text":"what..... a..... dump!!!! i went here with a friend for a drink. i made a terrible mistake. i ordered a cup of coffee at the bar.... 6 BUCKS!!!! what're you, nuts? you think i'm gonna pay 6 buc--- ok, i did. well, i might have got arrested if i tried to make a run for it. but 6 bucks!!!   you know what else? the manager of the place was a world-class dweeb. he stands behind you and stares, then he goes half-way up the stairs so he can glare at you from there. LOOOO-SERRRR!!!  surprisingly, the security guys were cool (i know that because i complained to them about this idiot manager). will i ever frequent this place again?.... wow, i'll have to really think about that---- NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Massive portions wouldn't even sum it up! I was extra hungry due to changing time zones etc etc and I couldn't finish my chicken, mac and cheese meal I got. It also came with like Garlic Bread which I didn't even touch! if anyone ever manages to finish this whole meal please tell me!!! The vanilla milkshake was awesome!"}
{"text":"Walked in,  was seated immediately... and that's all she wrote! Waited around for about 15 minutes,  no one came by to even greet us or even take our drink orders.  A family of 6 walked in after us was immediately taken care of. We walked right out! Maybe cuz we're tanned? Would have given negative 0 stars! Good thing Chili's was down the street they knew how to wait on us!"}
{"text":"Dog gone good burgers is what they're known for.  I'm here in Vegas for my birthday day with my boyfriend and we stopped in to grab a quick bite after a show.  They've got some cool memorabilia from artist like Madonna, The Who, Joss Stone, Mariah Carey, Brittany Spears, Elvis and Amy Winehouse.  Our waiter Damon was so nice and attentive even though the restaurant was closing in an hour.  We both ordered drinks which were tasty and strong!  I had the Air Mexico (a trio of 3 different flavored drinks)....I loved the Cucumber!  For dinner, we both had burgers.  Oh man were they delicious!  I had the hickory BBQ burger and it was cooked to perfection.  The burger is accompanied with their seasoned fries and sriracha mayo (pure heaven).  For a chain restaurant, this place is pretty awesome.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Mainly only 2 stars because the food was very overpriced even for having all the cool decor. Paid $21 for a nachos appetizer ($12 + $6 for adding meat and another $3 for guacamole) which was good but not worth the money. Also $15 for a burger and fries which was also good but not exactly $15 good. The server was very friendly but I did have to ask for a refill after my drink went empty and unnoticed. Overall the food was decent but it is hard to justify paying $21 for what is just as good as a  super nachos from Robertos. If your on vacation and not on a budget then it is a pretty cool place, lots of memorabilia. If you are on a budget then you may want to avoid this one."}
{"text":"I've been to Hard Rock before in San Francisco and wasn't impressed. I didn't want to go to this one but decided to try it again since the family wanted to go. The service was okay, the atmosphere is cool, but I have been throwing up non-stop since I ate there.. so pretty sure I got food poisoning. Therefore 1 star and I will never go back again"}
{"text":"Was there today after being at the ROM.  Firstly, the accessible door didn't work (my son is in a wheel chair).  We were seated quick enough, then that was it.  Fifteen minutes later, still no service, what so ever.  Our table was very visible.  So, we left.  Party foul, Hard Rock!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner, husband and I ordered the hot wings (grilled) OMFG... They were juicy and so tender. We also ordered the shrimp Caesar salad with shrimp. It was a great salad and we split everything. Highly recommend the wings. The bartender was awesome. I show you pics but we ate it so fast,"}
{"text":"We had an awesome time when we visited the Hard Rock for our anniversary. The place was kinda dead when we went but the tables and artifacts were clean and we were well taken care of. Server was friendly and attentive and we never needed anything. I got the salmon and loved it. She even brought out a free Sundae for our anniversary! Only problem is that parking can be tricky. It wasn't until later when we realized that they had $3 valet parking off Ontario on the Monday when we went. Probably will take advantage of that next time, rather than trying to park in the archaic parking lot tower city has. We are really lucky to have a place like this in Cleveland and we will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"My friend was craving a burger and beer so we decided to come here.  Expensive of course but pretty decent food and our server was awesome!  My mom got the mahi mahi sandwich.  It was pretty good.  My hubby and I both got veggie burgers and it hit the spot.  I got mine with the hot wing sauce and blue cheese...brilliant!  Skimpy on the fries but tasty."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews on Facebook before writing mine.  Seems to be hit or miss.  I have no complaints about the food.  It was fine.  My issue is with service and organization.  March 2017 Arrived 45 min before the show to eat and get a seat.  Tickets were will-call.  There was no hostess at the door to seat you.  You do not get a table by yourself it is concert seating so they stick you with other people.  They give you a wristband for having purchased a ticket but I looked around and saw at least 10 people without wristbands with better seats than I had.  I believe these people came earlier for dinner and realized there was a show and decided to stay and was never asked to pay.  If they had paid where is the wristband?  This was not a local venue it was Howie Day.  Those people should have been told they needed to leave by 8:00 or purchase a ticket before they were ever seated!  Service sucked took forever to be waited on.  I ordered a red berry press when I got it, it was missing raspberries.  Told waitress she said they were out of ingredients they will run out of stuff cause it's so busy.  Wtf!!!!????  I said you can't serve & charge me for a drink that's missing ingredients that I am paying for!!! She took it back and low & behold they had raspberries imagine that!  Are they skimping to save or forgot?  Who knows.  Not impressed.  Pay attention to what you are served!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience today! No waiting, good service, meals on time, check on time. My 4 year old was happy with color book and ice-cream with crushed oreo cookies. I was expecting photo shoot as before, but it was not there today :)"}
{"text":"The location of this Hard Rock was great - right next to the river with a huge Christmas tree out front. The best part was what I ordered: the local legendary. Wow! A huge cheese burger with onions and MASHED POTATOES! That's right, mashed potatoes! It was amazing! And messy! The downside of this Hard Rock was the location we were in, we were put in the back where there were next to no music memorabilia and we could not see or hear the live music. It was crowded. The service was relatively good. I'd go again just to have that amazing burger!"}
{"text":"Did the acoustic breakfast.  Great service and unlimited mimosa and Bloody Mary was the selling point.  Super service from a gal from Southern Indiana"}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe!!!   This was my absolute favorite restaurant on the strip. The food is terrific and the servers are amazing. The drinks will put you on your ass! They are that strong. For me, one was definitely enough! I had the rib eye medium rare and the chef did her thing! It was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had the salmon and he loved it. The food and service was so good that we came back the next day. We had different servers but the service was still superb. The food in Vegas is way better than the one in Orlando. I cant wait to go back and try other things off the menu."}
{"text":"Can you say unlimited bloody Mary's until 11:30am? Wow. Get you day started off right. They even had live music which was a very nice touch. Not too much on the memorabilia, but the food was great and he drinks strong and reasonably priced. Che k it it while it shopping."}
{"text":"Hard Rock entertainment is awesome! Braiden Sunshine performed on Fathers Day and the show was great!!!! Thanks Hard Rock Cafe, for a wonderful Fathers Day!"}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch burger.  Very empty and so service was great.  Drink was never empty.  Burger was very nicely done.  Music selection could be a bit better, maybe an off day.  Decorations was a plus, good experience.  Place is clean.  Parking is largely and easy."}
{"text":"After flying into Vegas on Sunday we went to Hard Rock for lunch. The food was very good and the servers we had were very friendly. Our drinks were also good.  No issues at all."}
{"text":"This is not revenge or me being upset about getting wronged. This is place in toronto is awful. Ontario has a law that states burgers must be cooked to medium well. Whether you like that or not, any chef willing to put a piece of charcoal on a bun and serve it is clearly someone that doesnt mind serving a bad meal. The waiter did not even warn us that this would be the worst burger in history. The reason to condemn the whole restaurant is that anyone serving good food would not knowingly serve awful food."}
{"text":"We saw their marquee outside about happy hour going to 7 PM on Thursday.  We had drinks and got the bbq burger that had bacon and a side salad.  While it was a bit pricey, they - burger and fries among with salad were very good.   The happy prices were also good.  Worth a visit to the bar."}
{"text":"I hadnt been to this chain in years... came for the yelp check in and it was decent grub... but I was completely reminded that it is a chain and consequently not that spectacular...   So this place in the 90s was the chit. I mean you had to have the t shirt from any of 10 cities to show how cool you were. Fast forward to today, and I don't think I have sen anyone in a hardrock café t shirt in at least 10 years. Crazy stuff truth be told. The swag here is the same as every other hard rock café worldwide, it just says lost wages on it instead of Albuquerque, Sydney, or London.   Pro Tip: Yelp check in for 20% off of your check not including alcohol.  I got a burger that was fairly average when I was here. It didn't stand out and make me go wow or think anything specific. To go with it I got french fried potatoes and topped them with cheese and BACON! Sadly it cost me an extra $2.50 for the cheese and bacon O_O   I was totally caught off guard by that. Especially when it was one strip of bacon crumbled and one slice of American cheese. Not exactly a great bang for your buck.  One of my friends had a salad which was purportedly decent. It came with a number of toppings and I bet the total calorie count was more than my burger and fries =X My other two friends there split a meal which they seemed to enjoy but weren't very excited about and I cant remember what they ordered haha.  Drinks were decent pours but that is expected in Vegas IMHO. Several hurricanes were delivered to our table and the girls enjoyed them and got them with the souvenir glasses.  Overall it was acceptable food but a bit pricey for what we received IMHO. The brand is not worth the extra cost at this point in time and it was an average meal with averagish service and bygone swag... so enjoy it if you go but don't expect much..."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before coming. Food definitely sub par....cold burger, watered down soda. Pretty much feel like we've been had...."}
{"text":"Always love coming here and exploring the memorabilia on the walls.  I have been to various Hard Rock's around the world and their food is usually very mediocre, and this location is the same.  Had the yogurt parfait for breakfast along with wheat toast and it didn't sit well.  Hubby had eggs benedict and said it was \"just alright\".  Service was FANTASTIC though.  Very attentive staff refilling coffee cups and checkin' in on us."}
{"text":"Great experience! From the time we got seated to the time we left we had a great experience! We came with a group of people and even had separate chefs and we didn't have one thing go wrong. We had a great server by the name of Patrick serve us!!! He was fun and informative! We ordered lots of drinks and appetizers and had lots of fun !! We also had great fun with another server by the name of Alejandro! We will definitely be going back because of the great staff and the food was amazing! Definitely recommend the nachos and the potato skins! They are great portion sizes and taste great! This place offers a great happy hour!!! It's totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"We came here shortly after I turned 21, but we were with my cousin who was a minor at the time so they're good for families. When we entered we were greeted by amazing classic rock, and an overall fun atmosphere. Our server was amazing, always cracking jokes and when he found out I had just turned 21 he kept brining me shots. And any time we wanted to hear a certain band, we would just tell him and he would put it on the list to play. We all had a great time, and should we ever go back to Vegas I would be very interested in going back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, environment fun,  prices not bad at all.  Really just reviewing to give a shot out to our server amy, she is a big prince fan and we visited the restaurant one day after prince passed and although she was absolutely torn up over prince, she was a really fun person and server.  We will see you next time amy!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience here after walking from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (it's about a mile walk but felt longer after walking all day at the museum). This location is smaller than other ones we've been to but it was still great. We had the lettuce wrap appetizer which was very tasty but very messy and we wished everything had been cut into smaller pieces so it fit better in the lettuce. My husband loved his local legendary burger and fries- the burger had salami on it- only in Cleveland! I had the chicken caesar salad- it was good but they left off the bacon (which I've always thought made their caesar salad unique- the black olives and bacon)- our server was kind enough to get me some on the side to add myself. The service was excellent and we enjoyed the environment. Their sign outside is especially cool too."}
{"text":"Entire staff was amazing. It's still a hard rock so you probably shouldn't come just for the food but the service at this one was phenominal. Top tier conversation and service, especially Luis the bartender."}
{"text":"The hubby and I came by here at happy hour while in town for a few drinks and appetizers. We ordered the bruschetta and nachos. He had a smoothie and I had a margarita? The bruschetta was one of the best we've had! So good. The nachos were awful. I can make better at home. Drinks were good. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here...but if near,mid go again."}
{"text":"Justin H, I'm calling you out. Slow service? Rubbish! We were served so fast that they actually had our meal ready for us four days before we got there!  Okay, I'm exaggerating, but the service was fast and with a smile. Brett Michaels (well, he looked like him) served us intelligently, even though he did upsell us on a Hurricane glass without saying that we were optioning in to buy it. It's okay though, he's working in the Hard Rock Cafe, I win the moral victory.  Anywho, the food was okay, though the portions felt a little on the drab/small side. The fries were excellent, but the Mojito I had was probably the worst I've ever had. What did they use, Domino and tap water? Nevertheless, the guy took it off my bill, after I made a face like I'd tasted bum.  Overall, this place is way too out of the way as far as the strip goes to be worth it, and price/selection wise really isn't going to blow anyone away. And no I will not ramble at length about the memorabilia - even the Baltimore branch was more impressive.   Take the family though, it's a great place for children. Especially children who like to run around the outside of the restaurant and get in your way."}
{"text":"Boo:(.  My red, white & blue burger was good but I must say the $14 price tag was a tad outrageous.  Not to mention the fact that there is a $3 charge for an upgrade to onion rings when each person at my table had exactly 6 onion rings on their plate!  Yes, that's right 1 burger, with 6 onion rings= $17.00.  Lame!!  This Hardrock is wack in ambiance too!  It is small and boring inside.  The music was barely audible and what I could hear was some terrible pop music that I had never heard before.  The servers must love there job though, the tab suggests a tip of 20%, exactly what you should tip on your $17 burger with 6 onion rings.  The server seemed sweet until she tried twice to upsell us an overpriced dessert.  Save your money and find somewhere else to dine.  Seriously not worth the 30 min wait and messy restroom either!"}
{"text":"Yum yum! We had a great experience dining here. Great food and speedy service. I really enjoyed all the selections offered on the menu- I felt like there was a lot to choose from. One of the best parts was watching the music videos while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here cause nothing else seemed open around the area and I was too tired to walk around looking for places to eat.  I don't really have much to say about HRC, I use to think it was a cool place to hang out when I was a teenager but now it just seems eh. The autographs and memorabilia all over the walls seem outdated and makes me feel old now. Just doesn't feel clean.  The food is ok -- really uneventful and overpriced.  3 stars cause the people that worked there were really nice, service was fast, and the food was...edible?"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to have drinks after a performance across the street at the arena. The people who worked there are all very friendly and Javi the bartender was a rockstar! I was really impressed how he kept up with so many people & made great drinks! He had an amazing energy about him & haven't seen such a good bartender for a large diverse crowd in years! This place also served excellent food.. I saw what other people were eating and I was like.. Yum! I need to come back when I am hungry!"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was also. Try the French Toast! And if you're a fan of fruity alcohol beverages, then you're in the right spot. Great view sitting outside also!"}
{"text":"Had amazing drinks, pina colada and strawberry margarita! Also a delicious dinner, I had a chicken quesadilla and it was so good, grilled chicken and super delicious! Great service!"}
{"text":"I asked the waiter what was gluten free on the menu and he didn't know. He asked the manager and still came back with a weird understanding of what I could order. It's strange that a huge chain like this would not have a gluten free menu or know what on their menu was ok to eat. It's the only restaurant that hasn't been accommodating to my gf lifestyle."}
{"text":"A pocos metros del Hard Rock Hotel se encuentra el Café bajo el mismo nombre. El ambiente es igual al de todas sus sucursales a lo largo del globo, y la carta también creo que es común entre ellos.   En el centro hay una barra, las mesas están organizadas a su alrededor. Se notaba que había mucha buena onda por parte de los que la atendían, pero no podías sentarte ahí al menos que tuvieras +21 años (#sad).   Me es difícil reseñar la atención. Todos son súper simpáticos, pero tardan muchísimo en acercarse a tu mesa. Entiendo que es un lugar enorme, y no hay tanta gente atendiéndolo, pero la compañía debería preverlo.   A la derecha de la entrada, y rodeando toda esa ala del café, está la tienda de regalos de la firma. Además de los artículos de ropa y vasos que hay en todos lados, venden algunos accesorios alegóricos de la ciudad.   Como salida es una re buena opción. Les tiro un par de datos sobre la comida.  -Acá me animé a probar el chicken & waffles (poco usual en Buenos Aires) y me encantó. No sé cómo, pero el pollo queda bien con syrup.  -Los pancakes de arándanos también son muy buenos.  -Para comer de todo un poco (salado) lo mejor es el Jumbo Combo.  -El cheesecake de Oreo la verdad es que no me gustó.  -El chocolate lava cake es muy rico.  -Hay tragos sin alcohol para los menores/no bebedores.  -Las potato skins son lo más."}
{"text":"This was a top notch Hard Rock Cafe experience.  We decided to hit up this Hard Rock for breakfast since it is one of the few locations which serve it.  Pro-Tip - between 11 and 11:30 you can order both breakfast and lunch!  We had the cornflake French toast and the lemon ricotta pancakes.   Both of which were awesome but the pancakes were especially yummy.  Nice freshly brewed iced tea and crispy bacon round up the mix.  They were having \"acoustic breakfast\" with a live musician which was cool.   This is a VERY large Hard Rock but it has a great selection of memorabilia and very efficient and friendly service.  Outdoor seating overlooking the strip is available if the weather is nice! Overall a great option!"}
{"text":"Erica my server was very welcoming, I was only staying for 1 drink yet happy hour cocktails was suggested and stayed for another .I enjoyed thoroughly and the Bartender made it"}
{"text":"Service: The service was ok. The wait staff and person who answered the phone to answer questions were all super friendly, but service in general was a bit slow and our waitress was very forgetful. One of my friends had to ask for the same thing more than once for her to get what she needed, but she was apologetic and nice about it.  Food: is pretty uniform among all hard rock cafes. I personally go to Hard Rock Cafe more for the atmosphere than the food. Not the best food in town and a bit \"fast-foody\". My only real complaint is the French fries were all soggy."}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland on business and got to my hotel late.  I wanted to walk around a little bit and breath the city in - unfortunately, I was thwarted at every turn!  Apparently Public Square is being torn up right now which makes it very challenging to walk more than a few feet outside in what I thought would be a lovely square.  I ended up back in Tower City and asked the security guards if they knew of anything open - they pointed me towards the Hard Rock.  I was hungry enough and tired enough that it didn't really matter.  So to the Hard Rock I tromped - I was one of perhaps 15 people in the restaurant so the service was prompt and responsive.  I purused the menu for a while and decided upon the crab cake sandwich - mostly because I'd had a burger for lunch.  It arrived quickly and was fine.  Nothing special.  It felt like it had a lot of fillers and barely made a dent in the bun - there was a 1.5 inch space between the edge of the bun and the cake.  Oh well.  The tartar sauce was a bit overwhelming and the lettuce was limp.  However, the fries were truly excellent.  I would consider going back - JUST for the fries!  The service was speedy and my waitress was really nice and accommodating.  She seemed to sense that I was tired and ready to go home.  She helped speed things along and brought me my check right away."}
{"text":"This is a review of this Hard Rock as a concert venue only.   Having not been to this location previously - I downloaded directions from the Hard Rock's website. The parking situation sounded tricky - and it was. The fact that the directions provided were incorrect didn't help. Parking for the venue is in the parking garage for the Showcase Mall - and costs 3.00 (cash only) to boot. Paying for parking is unheard of on The Strip!   OK - so once we find the parking lot, pay and park - the elevator dumps you out on a side street. About a block away from the entrance. We started walking toward Las Vegas Blvd. and slowly realized that all these people waiting in line were waiting to get into the venue. This is where it gets silly.   In order to get into the concert venue one needs to: 1. Wait outside in line in the desert heat. 2. Once you get past the first staggered security point - you're released by the security guard to walk down the public sidewalk (with everyone else that just happens to be strolling the strip unimpeded) to the entrance to the Hard Rock Store. You walk through the store - right through all the shoppers to three flights of steep stairs. All the while, there is nothing to keep random people that haven't waited in line from joining your group on the way (as one girl did - slipping into our group right behind us). So, lesson number one - only suckers wait in line... 3. It took about 45 minutes total to get into the venue - and we arrived at posted start time. Luckily, the show started late so we didn't miss any of the show.  Once we got inside, the venue actually wasn't bad. The sound was decent and although the place holds 1100 people - it still manages to feel intimate. In keeping with Hard Rock tradition - the artifacts and historical exhibits were well done and cool. Drinks are at Strip club price - $16.00 a round for a bourbon & coke and a Miller Light.  All I can say is, I've been a musician and an avid rock show attendee for three decades now - and I'm sorry - but it's obvious to me that they built the venue with no consideration as to how a large audience would actually access the performance space on the 3rd floor. This major planning fail kind of set the tone for the night unfortunately...  UPDATE: I received a few very nice messages from Hard Rock management - and they'll be working to address the entrance issues and are hoping to make this location into a premiere Las Vegas music venue.  I can't wait to see what they can work out."}
{"text":"this review is more aimed at the Gift Shop at the cafe, as I did not eat at the cafe.  However, when I receive excellent customer service somewhere, I have to alert the masses!   My parents were here from MA and my dad just HAD to get a Hard Rock Cafe - Las Vegas Shirt.  The gift shop is well set up and the girl working the counter was AWESOME.  Super friendly and accommodating.  She built a solid rapport and completed the transaction with a smile.  I know, doesnt sound like it was out of the ordinary, however, I can be a tad snobbish with the trendy younger crowd places.  I have ran into too many people at these places that are too cool for their job.  But she did a wonderful job"}
{"text":"\"Bottomless\" mimosas and \"bottomless\" bloody mary ........ $8 a refill. Can't get any more messed up than that."}
{"text":"Overpriced but yummy.  I always walk by this place so one day I figured I'd go in. I went during lunch and it was almost empty, which is worrying since it's so close to Yonge Dundas square.   After looking at the prices on the menu though, its not surprising that it was so deserted... the pricing is just not competitive for other restaurants in the area. Still, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and Oreo cheesecake, both of which looked and tasted delicious.  The waitress was friendly, service was good, but I found the atmosphere and pricing to be offputting. It has more of a tourist-y feel and I would not go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here last night for dinner after a little retail therapy at Ross about 3 stores down. I've considered Hard Rock Cafe as the quintessential tourist resto with all the souvenirs on the first floor. We sat at the bar as we didn't want to wait 20 min for a table and they serve the full menu at the bar anyways. We got the Bruschetta ($11.95) and we split the Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas ($21.95). I got the Mango Berry Cooler ($4) as it was over 107 degrees outside (this was around 8 pm here in Vegas!). They also offer a Souvenir glass for $5 extra to put your drink in which, as the server told us, doubles the serving of the drink. The food was pretty good but I could tell the chicken and shrimp were frozen just by their texture.  I wouldn't say that I would come here often as the prices are on the high side but the service was good. I would come here if I was in the mood for a good burger, fries, and some good old 90s music..."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this particular Hard Rock.  I always get the Twisted Mac and Cheese with Chicken. It was super tasty as always.  The server even recommended some ways to customize the dish if we wanted to change it up a bit.  Our drinks were always full, the bathrooms were very clean.  My favorite part of the whole dining experience was that we sat on the patio overlooking the strip.  The layout of this particular Hard Rock is fantastic, and we received outstanding service!  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I was told at reception that no tables available on the patio. However, it was half empty on a sunny afternoon  in Toronto. Apparently trying to save costs. Many people angry about it. Bad manager? (See picture)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The GM Brent and bartender Javi were so friendly and great to talk to. They were both so helpful and attentive. Definitely went above and beyond to provide great service!   They had some smaller brewery beer selections on tap, which was a great change of selection compared to surrounding bars. Oreo cheesecake was so good!   If you're ever seeing a concert nearby, we would highly suggest stopping in. We'll definitely visit again if we're ever in the area. :)"}
{"text":"I  have only came once before many moons ago. However, this time around was a very memorable experience from beginning to end. The hostess was pleasant and in a good mood. She informed us of the vegetarian options, but we were there for burgers! Before, she left the table she stated \"Your server today is Josh and you'll love him.\"  Typically, when someone from the restaurant compliments their fellow worker it's just \"part of the process.\" But, this time she was spot on.  Josh came to the table and introduced himself to our table. He allowed us to place our drink orders and gave us ample time to order our food. We did not feel rushed in the process. He even gave a great recommendation on The Big Texan sandwich with pulled pork ( I was there for a burger).   Not once did we have to ask for refill or any extra napkins. Josh was always one step ahead.  He brought plenty of condiments for our orders and informed us that he likes for people to enjoy there food and would check on us periodically.  Not once did our table ever question where Josh was or needed anything additional.   At the end of our lunch we asked to speak to the manager Courtney. Josh was curious but got her anyway. When she came out we asked Josh to stay. We spoke on how our experience was the most pleasant because Josh was the best and he needed to be recognized. Courtney thanked us and said that Josh wasn't going anywhere and that she was glad to hear how our experience went!   The food was cooked perfectly, fries were well-seasoned and the burger was done to perfection (way to go kitchen staff). All-in-all if you're looking for a good place to lunch, come here and ask for Josh! Tell him I sent ya!"}
{"text":"I'm typically not into restaurants like this (meaning the Planet Hollywood, Rainforest Cafe, etc), but this was great! It was a fun time.  The food was amazing, and so was the service.  It was nice to keep with the music theme after visiting the Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"I came here last night to see a friend of mine play a show! This is the second time I've seen them play her, and both times I had a great time!   The first time I came here I had some kind of pulled pork sandwich which was just alright, but I saw a manager scream at my poor waitress which kinda left a bad taste in my mouth.   Last night my friend and I had the appetizer sampler which came with spinach artichoke dip, chicken wings, chicken tenders, onion rings, and some kind of brushetta flatbread. My friend doesn't like onion rings, so they allowed us to sub french fries, which was nice. Everything was just ok, nothing special. The only thing that was wholly awful were the chicken wings - not only were they cold, they were rubbery and just plain gross. We got bbq because my friend can't eat spicy and they were still spicy. They were just weird and we didn't even eat them. We also had the brownie sundae which is $10 which we thought was outrageous until we saw the size of the thing. It was HUGE. Like bigger than my head. You need like a football team to eat the thing. Four of us still only ate like a third of it. Wow it was big.   Our server was very nice, I don't remember her name but she was pretty fast and attentive. Only thing she ever forgot was a twisted lemonade that I had to remind her about but once I did she grabbed it right away!  Overall an ok place, wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to eat here but definitely come for the drinks and the music! I'll be back whenever My Fair Rosalie is playing!"}
{"text":"Ok.... glitz... glamour... whatever...  I don't buy into that fluff.  My mom was actually the one that said that she wanted to go here... something about some gift cards that she had been toting around... ok fine..  I think it had really been about 10 years since i've been to a Hard Rock Cafe.... I think it was in New Orleans... and it wasn't that memorable.  This one was a pretty good experience.  I still had my doubts as I was looking over the menu...  $15 for a 10oz burger?  ouch...  I wasn't even going to look on the menu for the $8 shake... thats just out of hte question.  So I ordered a burger to share with my wife... and a side of the Mac&cheese that I read on here was good.  The wait was on the long side....which as it turns out... I noted, but was entertained enough for it not to matter.  I know this will show my taste in music, but here's what I remember of what was playing:  Billy Idol  - White wedding Rolling Stones - Paint it black Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun Live - Lightning Crashes Green Day - some song I forgot the name Paul Mcart - some other song where when he sings he sticks his neck out like a chicken(oh wait.. that's all of them) some Billy joel song....  the food came and the burger was quite good... the Mac and cheese was pretty durned guud too.  I wandered into the store, and while a onesie for the little girl was a bit on the pricey side at $14, a button down casual shirt for me at $40 wasn't too bad... we'll see how long it lasts.  Overall... I was won over again.. I still don't like the fact that you pay a variable cost of being there in the amount of food that you order, but it's ok as a once-in-a-long-while place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was pretty much the same fair as you get at other Hard Rock Cafe's.  Location was great, Station Square area, where there are many other restaurants, some shops and entertainment.  Location is near one of the three rivers.  Staff was friendly and had the chance to see some cool memorabilia. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"First time at this location and my review is just based on my experience.   The ambiance is awesome.  It's a great go see and watch.   The waitress,  ours,  was maybe to busy as it was hard to get her attention at times.   The food and drink was hit and miss.  They have a mystery mojito, don't get it.  It has way to much of a cucumber flavor which ruins it.   The artichoke flatbread dip was good but you run out of flat bread before your done with the dip.  Their hickory bbq budger was great."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for the first time and decided to stop in for some food as I was walking the strip. My sister ordered the chicken wings. Those were pretty good. I ordered the nachos however, and those were very bad. I added chicken to the order but I think that made it even worse. There was a funky taste that wasn't so pleasant. And they add some weird green sauce on top (I don't think it was guacamole though). I definitely wouldn't order them again. I've had my fair share of nachos; these were the worst.   Service was good though. Very friendly waitress (crystal). I would probably go back but I would definitely stick to something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Well, it's a chain. But a fun chain with good food. I've not eaten here for many years (here meaning HRC, not just in Cleveland). It was like going back to a friend's house.   The wait on a holiday was just over 30 minutes, not too bad. Got a booth next to Stevie Nick's autograph and photo, so I was very happy about that. Numerous TVs showed concerts and I always thought people were looking at me when they were really just looking at the TV behind me!   Service was a little slow because they were so busy, but it was nice.   Food was better than I remembered. My issue was, eating there alone, they don't allow half orders of apps. I'm not going to order a whole app and a meal and spend the money to eat only half. Might I suggest, Mr. Cafe, that you offer half sized apps?   Great fries, tasty Texas BBQ pulled pork, great beans, but mostly sauce and would have liked more actual beans."}
{"text":"Is this pool for real? Are the boobs in this pool for real? Is anything floating in this pool for real? Will someone please give one of these skinny bitches a sandwich??  I've never seen so many beefy tattooed men with ripped abs with floozies on their arms. Rock music pumping, inner tubes bouncing.. this pool is way too cool for me.  Body English is where these people flock to for their late night dance hip hop party. Don't even think of coming here unless you look good. Oh and if you have a penis, that's going to be a problem. A big one. (no pun intended) Come early and expect to drop some money at the door."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Great ambiance. Loud \"rock music\" i think they should have a better music selection. hehe.... play more rock and roll and not pop, hip hop etc...  but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"First experience: it was good had the hickory smoke combo ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were a+ amazing Def loved it more than the other spots I have been to. While in vegas. The drinks were also good we got complementary glasses. Sat outside cause you do have that option. Wanted to try their desert May be next time"}
{"text":"Let's face it, Hard Rock Cafe isn't known for its fine dining experience, but when in the city of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you almost have to go. The food was OK, our server was awesome and fun, with purple hair and coolness! My fiancé loved the weird indie-type videos so he was happy, and my gigantic blue drink made me very happy. It was not disgusting but a bit odd, I can see how someone might not like it but that doesn't mean it was made wrong.  If you go in, ask for Cholo Baggins, she will take awesome care of you! :))"}
{"text":"Atmosphere always great, food tasted ok a little better than most chain restaurants.  Expensive not a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"We got there 7 pm. and place was hopping. Our freinds had grilled salmon with veggies and mash, we had their burgers and a club. Well, we can't say its rocket science to cook a burger. The food was good but pricey."}
{"text":"It's a hard rock. We went for an early dinner on a Friday. There was no wait for a table and we were seated promptly.   The waitress was efficient and not overly friendly. The food came very quickly and was served hot and fresh.   The only true gripe I have is that hard rocks in general are over priced. The food is the same at all of the chain restaurants. I would prefer to hit up an Applebee's and save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Went here last Thursday night during our stay in Vegas.  We had a great experience.  We were seated right away by a friendly hostess and treated to prompt and again, friendly, service.  We ordered fish and chips, NY strip steak and the kids got burgers.  Eveything was delicious!  The only thing that didn't do it for me was the giacamole.  Just not enough spices :(  As for dessert, we got the warm brownie (served ala mode) and the apple cobbler.  Yumm yumm.  A fair warning though, the place is loud because of the music, but we had noisy kids so this was perfect!  Fun night and good food albeit a little on the pricey side...although...this is Vegas people."}
{"text":"After the Ducky Tour,  you receive a 15% off coupon at the Hard Rock.  That made for a nice combination!  We had great service and attention from our waiter John. Food was good except for grilled chicken which was flavorless and colorless. Prices are high for an average meal"}
{"text":"We love this place and come for food and drinks every time we are in Vegas, call it a tradition. We usually get the combo appetizer with wings, onion rings, chicken tenders, spring rolls, and brushchetta. I don't care for the spring rolls but my husband does. Everything else on the combo is very good. Drinks are good, especially if you like foo foo drinks. The best part? Rock and roll baby!! The bar is a very large oval shaped configuration with nice views of the strip."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and awesome appetizers. Our waitress was quick and it was a convenient location since we were taking in a Suns game after dinner."}
{"text":"It's 93 degrees in the shade. Stopped here for lunch before heading back to the hotel for a nap. Jason was our cheerful server, and he quickly took our order. An arugula salad ($15) and a club sandwich ($12). Not sure why the salad was more than the sandwich - maybe because it was healthy?  The dining room is spacious and clean, and I would rate it an A. As always, I check the bathrooms. If they are filthy it's likely the kitchen is to. In this case I would give them a C on the bathroom since it was small, cramped, and cluttered. It could use a cleaning.  I had to wait 10 min to get refills on my water, which is unacceptable, particularly since I told the server I would be drinking a lot of water due to the heat.   That said, the food was the best part of the visit. It was delicious. The club sandwich was typical, but there was plenty of it. It was accompanied by a small side of cole slaw which was a little dry. It also was served with crisp fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove from Buffalo NY to Toronto to collect this location's Core guitar pin (the plain acoustic with the location printed on the body). When we got there, the associate said they were out of them and had been for awhile. .. how can you be out of your standard pin?! I wasn't happy to hear that since we had just driven 2+ hours for it. However, the associate was very nice and apologetic, and she helped me find a pin that would still work with my collection. It was an acoustic guitar that had a Canadian goose with a mohawk. I thought it was cute and now I have a story to go with it. Even better was that it was only $5 so it was definitely worth it! We did not eat at this location but I still give 4 stars because I left happy despite being upset that they didn't have their standard pin."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a \"girls\" weekend. Bought ticket for a Super Bowl party.  Thought the whole set up was amazing and fun even though I'm not a football fan , it was nice to have beverages and food all you can consume. And the staff was wonderful. I would pay for something like this again if I was back to Vegas during Super Bowl."}
{"text":"Whenever I think of the Hard Rock I always think of the movie Honey, I Blew Up the Kid where the giant kid grabbed the giant neon guitar, from I don't remember if it was the hotel or cafe, and started playing with it.  Anyways I love the atmosphere and all of that rock memorabilia. There's a bar right in the middle with a number of small and medium sized tv's, notice how I didn't say big or large tv's. The customer service was pretty good too as they were accommodating to our party, friendly, and brought everything, food, drinks, check in a timely manner. And of course they had no problem taking the 20% off per Yelp check-in offer.  For the food, a lot of what we ordered was decent at most. First up was the jumbo combo which was basically a sampler of their various apps it had some wings, chicken tenders, onion rings, artichoke dip, parmesan flatbread and bruschetta, and a few dipping sauces. It was a nice start for a party of 5 and of course I got a little full eatting everything no one else didn't want. The platter was alright only thing I didn't like was the flatbread and bruschetta cause it was hard and messy to eat I might've even chipped a few teeth.  Next came what I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich. It was plenty filling just dry and tough. Maybe the bread took some of the moisture. It didn't come with any kind of sauce which could've maybe helped, maybe. Also came with fries and beans.  The bbq trio was bbq chicken, ribs, and brisket. Good portion but everything was very dry. Funny cause I think I read that it was supposed to be tender.  We never made it to the desserts but everything looked tempting. Probably would be back.  They also have their own parking so you don't have to park at the hotel and walk over."}
{"text":"First time here, when you walk in they take your picture in front of a hard rock back drop, during your meal they find you with the printed pic of your group and ask if you  would like to purchase the 5X7 and two 4x6s for $20, kind of a rip of but assuming a lot of people do it.  Margaritas were good, about $15, at the end of your meal they give you your receipt and you go to the store downstairs and you get a \"free\" monogrammed margarita glass.. Kinda cool if you care about something like that?   The hamburger that they are supposedly known for kinda sucks.  The patty looks/tasted like it was microwaved and wasn't medium like we ordered it was def well done. The main reason we came here was the awesome outside seating and view of the strip! Def was a plus. Other than that beers were fairly priced and was a good time?"}
{"text":"Short amd sweet: Atomic burger was decent (nothing atomic about it) and the weakest long island iced tea I've ever had ($10)....  saw my waitress walk back and forth but she only spoke to me when she took my order, when I got my food and when I asked for the check."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm near one, we go! I love the Hard Rock Cafe's! The Hard Rock Nachos was amazing! HUGE portion! It's the 2nd largest Hard Rock in the nation! Orlando is #1. Fun, loud atmosphere with friendly service. And if you are a pin collector, you've got to check them out! I only collect drone HRC's I visit and the pin I collect has to be a guitar with the city or cafe name. Fun times, really good food!"}
{"text":"We went here to see Bobby Brown (eventually-you know, once he decided to actually show up) and I really liked the venue.  It was intimate and the bartenders were quick and attentive.  The prices on drinks confused the heck out of me.  I couldn't figure out why a cranberry and vodka cost more than my long island but whatever.  A good time was had by all.  Also, there is a grand assortment of lotions and whatnots in the women's restroom which was awesome."}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday brunch with a couple of coupons we had won from a company party that included the bottomless mimosas and bloody marys(normally about $15per person) with breakfast, and everything was spectacular. Our server took our coupons and immediately brought out 2 drinks per person! We ordered the Benedict and Steak and Eggs, and the drinks just kept coming-2 or 3 at a time. I loved not having to track her down and ask for more.  A huge plus was the LIVE entertainment vocalist who was killing it on his covers.The bill would've only came out to $70 which was so worth it for the quality of service and atmosphere that was there. As a local, I wouldn't mind bringing visiting friends here to show off the great strip view."}
{"text":"War mit 2 Freunden bei einem Wochenendbesuch in Las Vegas und da wir im Hard Rock Hotel übernachtet hatten, folglich zum Frühstück/Lunch im Hard Rock Café. Unsere Sandwiches haben ausgezeichnet geschmeckt und der Service war ebenfalls in Ordnung."}
{"text":"Great service.  I got the lettuce wraps as a meal.  Boyfriend got a bacon cheeseburger.  The waiter persuaded us to get our beers in the 40th anniversary collector's glasses.  When we got our check we asking if they could wash out the glasses to take with us.  Instead the waiter presented our check to us with a 2 handled bag and 2 boxes in it with clean brand new glasses in each."}
{"text":"Food was good. We loved meeting Devlin the longest working Hard Rock Server in North America. She was very nice."}
{"text":"Very cool Hard Rock. Very little parking."}
{"text":"Well I mean it's the Hard Rock Cafe so what can you say.  I am not really a fan of chains but stopped in for a drink during a downtown Phoenix bar hop.  We arrived pretty early on a weeknight so it was pretty dead.  We sat at the bar and had really good service, all the bartenders were super nice and let us try different liquors.  The one thing I can say for a chain is that it is consistent and you can expect that things will be the same and of an acceptable quality.  The drinks were expected, good but overpriced."}
{"text":"The Hard Rock is usually a solid spot. Stopped here after a game to get some drinks. Place was about to close so it was pretty empty, but we stumbled through the door in single file ready to make it work!  The interior was actually pretty great. Nice wood floors and things that would catch your attention including a piano. We sat down at the bar and the excellent bartender took our first round and then the last call. Prices were pretty steep for shots, but the bartender pointed out that they were 50% off during that time which was great!  Had a great conversation with the bartender and not only that, but he gave us a free round as well as took shots with us so can't complain!  Looking forward to stopping by here again and trying out the food as well.  5 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"We went in after seeing online that they offered a good happy hour. Not so. A couple cheesy drink specials, but not the food specials we saw online. We decided to stay since we were there. Food was okay, nothing to brag about. The view was nice since we were on the patio by the railing. Server was good but a bit slow and they weren't busy.  Works if you're just hungry and want to fill the void. Otherwise, nothing special."}
{"text":"I don't want to get off on a rant but:  I can remember in the '90's when going to a Hard Rock was actually cool.  Awesome memorabilia, prices that were steep but not over the top for acceptable food, a good mix of actual rock music and overall it was a decent experience.  I don't know what the hell happened but maybe ten or so years ago the bottom dropped out and quite honestly you've got to have multiple screws loose to actually enjoy eating here.  So we came two weeks ago and I got sucker punched by the lovely children who think the Hard Rock atmosphere is cool even though both really aren't big fans of the food.  Couple that will the stupid 15% off coupon you get from doing the Duck Tour next door and they got another sheeple in the door.  (Baaaa)  www.youtube.com/watch?v=rooPPLtK9pg  The service was a miss as we waited a good ten plus minutes just to have our drink order taken and then another five to seven to have it brought to the table plus a good five to seven more to actually get to the ordering stage.  So that makes around 20-25 minutes just to get the order placed.  At Ruth's Chris I get that because of the pomp and circumstance of the experience but at a Rock Hard?  Really?  Speaking of the drinks, so after our server \"M\" drops off the drinks we immediately smell something coming from the kids cups and it's not good.  They ordered apple juice and the color was off, the look was slightly congealed and the taste well.....let's just say if you stuck a bottle of apple juice on the sidewalk in downtown Phoenix for a week and then served it you probably would get that level of a rotten-spoiled smell.  Of course \"M\" initially instead of apologizing for her/the bartender's screw up insisted that it was merely \"a little salty.\"    Salty my ass, the stuff was down right putrid and never should have been served.  That led into another lengthy search to see if any other juice could be found only in the end, Viola, more apple juice of the non-skunked variety mysteriously appeared.  Eventually after about an hour the drinks and food finally hit the table.  Talking about the food here is mostly irrelevant as it's grossly overpriced for what it is.  I mean if you took off maybe 15-20% then things would be closer to fair but when you're talking about $15 dollar salads & burgers there is nothing that a place like this can serve that's going to give you any ROI in return for your dining dollars.  And as for the music, I've noticed the recent trend at other HRC locations in Baltimore, Orlando & Atlantic City where there's not a whole lot of rock being played at the Hard Rock.  Unless of course you count Blondie, Madonna, Gwen Stefani and Chic as rock.  No thanks as I ain't No Hollaback Girl.  Overall the food is probably a C+ or a B- but when you bring in an F for prices that brings the grade down closer to a D in that department and the service was a clear F for \"M's\" brain dead attempt to serve rotten apple juice while spending more time calling it salty than actually apologizing/fixing the problem/greasing my palm for the long wait and inconvenience of the entire drink experience.  No Mas on any HRC in the future.  Blech!"}
{"text":"First: Big ups to Yelp and giving me a 20% off food coupon on my phone after checking in at Hard Rock Café.  We were in a group of 10 so that was big savings.  Showed it to the waiter and he applied the discount no problemo.  Food: Disappointing to say the least.  Pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.  I also observed my other friends who did not finish their food, not a good sign given that it was lunch and we were hungry.   Drinks: had a large sized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.  Tasted like there was no booze at all.  My friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.  Not happy.  Service: combined with the 20% off Yelp coupon, the service was the saving grace points of our visit.  Our guy was spot on, full of energy, would sing along with the tracks in the background and give us descriptions of the dishes.  Now if only the descriptions could turn into taste, it would have been a better experience."}
{"text":"In a heat induced desperation my wife and I decided to abandon our other lunch plans to seek refuge from the 115 degree LasVegas strip and Hard Rock happened to be the closest spot, and we were glad for it!  First of all the staff was just amazing, I don't remember ever being treated better at a restaurant! Every person we interacted with was very friendly and helpful, like above and beyond helpful! Our server was a bit off the wall to look at, but it appears they encourage it here and I think that is why everyone here seemed to really enjoy working for Hard Rock.   I ordered a burger special which was basted in an IPO Bbq sauce, topped with a grilled pineapple, bacon, and some mango salsa. It was a half pound burger, and I was a bit worried about that, because they often end up being bland and dry, but their patty was very high quality and tasty, and cooked a perfect medium rare. My burger was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat.  I also got my burger with a side of bacon cheese fries which were delicious, the fries were crispy, the cheese was melty, and it was real bacon chopped up and fried to a crisp, no cheap bacon bits here.   My wife ordered the smokehouse sandwich, which was a pulled chicken sandwich topped off with haystack onions, fried jalapeños, and a chipotle purée. She thought it was good but wished she had gotten the pork instead, as she isn't a huge fan of pulled chicken, and thought it was a BBQ chicken breast when she ordered it (her oversight in reading the menu) I had a bite or 2 and thought it was really good, the chicken was fresh and had a nice crisp to it, but was also tender, juicy and flavorful.  I also ordered a \"Strawberry Basil Lemonade\" which was just delicious, and a godsend on such a hot day! Usually the default combo would be mint leaf, but wow basil is my new favorite lemonade additive!  I'm glad we stopped in here, and will make Hard Rock a regular stop from here on out, if I had one complaint it would be that their prices are pretty out of control, but then again what isn't in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on the weekend of  7/7/13.  Cleanliness: Biggest issue. All of the silverware at our table had some sort of dirty/cleanliness issue. One fork in particular had a big strand of what looked like wilted lettuce caked on to it. Although all were replaced promptly, this silverware should have never made it to the table: lack of attention to detail and lack of care. Also makes one wonder of the condition of the back kitchen.  Service: Ronnie was awesome and very friendly  Food: I had the fajitas. The meat was cooked fine, but the veggies were mostly undercooked, which just seemed lazy to me. My company had a BBQ sandwich which was good. The other had the boneless spicy chicken which was fine.  Shop: the clerk at the shop didn't seem to care that we were there or not. Usually they are a lot more friendly and engaging.  Summary: I really enjoy the Hard Rock, but today's visit was below my expectations, and I sensed an overall lack of attention to cleanliness/detail/care."}
{"text":"Last night me and my friend paid for open bar , I have never seen such a bad customer service, bartenders looked like they are so miserable they never smiled. Overall I'm giving it 2 stars because the drinks were good but would not comeback."}
{"text":"If chain restaurants offer us consistency in service and quality, well, I never need to darken the door of Hard Rock.  Good.  20 people walk in on a Friday night.  There is only 1 table in the WHOLE place - and the highlight of the group was the 100 year old dude wearing suspenders.    The bartender acted as if the vandal hordes had just descended on her.  Seriously, I think she thought she was done for the night.  She got pissy with our multiple orders, couldn't remember 2 drinks at a time, and generally was a pain in the ass.  None of the drinks stood out as anything fancy, so we started to pack up and leave.  While waiting for my friends to settle up, I stationed myself outside the door, and did some \"in person Yelping\"  - basically telling everyone thinking about walking in to run.    Well, I guess a drunk girl standing outside telling you not to enter is not a good deterrent for everyone.  Out of the 5 couples that came up (Conan O'Brian's show had just ended - go Team Coco!) 2 decided to try somewhere else on my words....smart people, they will go far in life.  The other 3 doubted my wisdom, and ventured inside.    All 3 walked out before the last of my friends did - every single one of them was stunned at how the single staff member working made them feel like they were intruding (I did exit polling) and decided that there must be another place in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night that would like some money."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was good, staff was super friendly, but a little inattentive.  Not a big deal because we didn't need to be anywhere.  We sat outside and it was nice.  A little noisy when the jet's flew over to land @ the airport.  A little pricey for what you get, but hey, you're paying for the \"experience.\"  All in all, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Really substandard quality in here.  Having eaten in many restaurants in Vegas, I felt I got cheated by coming here.  Service was friendly, but the food was not the star."}
{"text":"Great location. Hard Rock Cafe fare is good. Nice place to hear a band and relax. Anyone that complains about healthy food choices should know that if you want to eat healthy, you don't eat out. ....and to lower a rating because it is in Pittsburgh? You are ranking the cafe, not the town. Ordered spicy mac and cheese with chicken, chicken fajitas, beef nachos, all very good for bar fare. Drinks are expensive so bring some $$. Servers are top notch and that announcer is a scream......"}
{"text":"This was the first Hard Rock Cafe I've been to. The burger was huge (I couldn't eat the whole thing) and cooked perfectly. The fries were great too! Dinner was amazing!!! The rock memorabilia is fun to look at while you wait for your food and I love listening to decent music instead of the crap most places play! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Come here before the kenny chesney concert.  And took over 30 min to get one drink.  And the manager was so rude to everyone.    They have more then half there tables open and still have a hour wait. .  The staff is rude and all standing around talking.  Dirty tables everywhere.  But i guess gossiping and talking shit about customers is more important than customer service.   Being in the industry i am disgusted by the service and the attitude i will never come back. . Oh yeah 35 min now still no drink.."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep gravitating back to this HRC location because it's always been just blah at best. Last night's dinner was no different.  Went with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game.   The place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.  Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them.   Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*  Most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.  It's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I\"m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one.   Can't SOMEONE put a decent place in downtown Phoenix? PLEASE!"}
{"text":"What is there really to review a couple of cold beers and some Nachos service was great"}
{"text":"Over priced and not great service.. And the restaurant wasn't busy. Others were sat after us and served food before us after are order was placed before theirs. The 5$ off coupon you get on the strip cannot be used for drinks and their happy hour times is not food."}
{"text":"I went to Hard Rock Cafe for the first time with a coupon for a $4 meal. (Legenary burger, fries, and soft drink) The only positive is that the food was alright. It was good for the $4 I paid, but not the $15+tax and tip it was normally.  The cons: - The customer service was laughable. Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said \"Good? Good?\" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less.  - The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh. - The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce. - The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries.  - The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table. I expected loud music at the Hard Rock Cafe, but not bad loud music."}
{"text":"It's always fine at Hard Rock. The staff was great and the food was tasty.  Lots of good music and videos to enjoy while enjoying your meal. We both had great burgers and the fries are very well seasoned. Also, our drinks never ran out before they had more in front of us."}
{"text":"Great friendly service downstairs and fantastic dining service. I got eggs Benedict and it was pretty good. Liked that it came with fresh fruit. Nice way to start the day."}
{"text":"Other than the ambiance of being a  Rock & Roll restauarnt, this place isn't good.  The food sucks.  I came in for a birthday party with 6 people, and not one of us actually enjoyed our food.  We had called ahead (2 weeks) to reserve a table before a game.  When we got there, the table had not even been set up.  We were 20 minutes later than planned getting to our table, and we missed 1 entire 1st inning and the top of the 2nd because it took so long to get our food."}
{"text":"HRC has the best ambience in the city. The cauliflower burger is delicious. The pomegranate mule was refreshing in the hot summer. The fountains at the back with the music was fantastic. Highly recommend this diner. Good memories made at Station Square. The atmosphere in the evening here is amazingly beautiful and colorful."}
{"text":"Great Food and Service!!!  A bit on the pricey side but good none the less.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy other Hard Rock cafes you will have a very similar experience here. The food is typical -nothing spectacular but nothing bad too - the service is fast and polite, while the outside patio is extremely nice when the weather is good.  It faces right at the fountain and the river and it is really really nice.  The music is nice (at least for whoever likes rock apparently :)) and there was nothing really bad associated with my experience there."}
{"text":"Great bartender Drew made tasty drinks, poured perfect drafts and made good conversation. Food was usual hard rock. Had a great afternoon here.  Drew made the experience exceptional!"}
{"text":"Thank you Emily L. for rescuing our visit. We came with our friends to enjoy lunch. We had a large party; mainly consisting of children (normally people would run away from) but Emily handled it remarkably. We asked for seating for 11 outside and at first; the original staffers jumped right on it. They were moving tables and everything to get our large party accommodated and then it seemed like they just disappeared.   My husband went to investigate and here comes our hero: Emily L. She came over very pleasant and energetic; ready to take care of us. She was patient (we didn't take up a whole lot of time but still) with the children and even going above and beyond.   We asked her about some local sights and she was ready to get the info even when she didn't had the answer for us. Just top notch.   Now to the food  everything was delicious. It was lunch time; but I didn't eat too much. We ordered children's meals (which come on a guitar plate which the children absolutely loved). They were nicely portioned. It's a gamble for us when order for our 10-yr old off the children's menu because he can eat like an adult; but he was satisfied. So thumbs up   Husband and I ordered the jumbo combo appetizer. Yummy. Good portions. I like the fact that you can choose the flavor of wings you get; normally it's preset so that was nice.   I forget the cool memorabilia Hard Rock has. I saw a robe Elvis wore in one of movies; we saw a keytar Stevie Wonder played; a guitar from the Motley Crew; Michael Jackson jacket; It was cool.   Oooo let me not forget the manager!!! I can't remember his name but I know that he was from the Baltimore location training in Pittsburgh. He was great, friendly; made sure we had everything we needed. Had a nice little chit-chat because we're all from Baltimore and he was letting us know about some exciting things happening there, so we can't wait to get to the Harbor and check out that location.   Everyone really enjoyed Hard Rock. If we're ever back in the Pitts; we'll definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Last minute choice after walking around town..standard fare and consistent with other chain sites..could tell use of immersion cooking..that said the salmon was good..server was enthusiastic and even got a deal on a shirt along with my mil discount.."}
{"text":"No lines, no wait. The hostess was very polite and courteous. They first seated us next to the restrooms but happily changed us far from them when requested. Then the highlight - Our server - SARAH! She was super awesome. Friendly, Energetic, Helpful, will totally make you happy about your day (even when it was crazy 106 outside!). The service was fast and the food was good. Music was super good with all my favorite classics. We had the Kids' Mac-n-Cheese (4.5/5), Fiesta Burger (5/5) and the Shrimp Fajita (4.5/5). Loved the place, Sarah and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Hard Rock Cafe in general, but this one is definitely awesome.  My bartender was nice, and really fun.  The food was reasonably priced, delicious, and out pretty quick.    It was late on a Friday night, and I had just come in off a long stint on the road (drove in from Barstow, but thanks to an overturned semi that drive took a little over 5 hours), so I was just happy to find a place still serving dinner.  I was even more delighted that it was a relaxed atmosphere where I could have a few drinks before heading out onto the strip.  I was having a bad night when I walked in, and a good night by the time I walked out - so I'd say it was worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad. The service was fair a little slow. The food was very good for Hard Rock Cafe.  One of the best Hard Rocks I've been to. I had the salmon and it was good and well prepared. I have to recommend the spicy mac and cheese. It wasn't too hot but had delicious flavor to it.   This place is cool to walk around and look at the different Rock artifacts. They was a way cool guitar from Tom petty on display. Also towards the upper level waiting area there was a Vegas entertainer display with Elvis stuff and a Sammy Davis Jr suit. You can see some cool Vegas history here so take your time and look around it's like a free museum"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this review because, in all fairness, our service was amazing, but the food was very lackluster. We arrived around 8:45 on a Saturday night with a party of 12 and were fortunately seated within 30 minutes-the restaurant was not crowded at all. That alone should probably say something. The reason my group picked this as a dinner spot was due to the number of picky eaters and unwillingness to stray too far from their hotel. This was 100% not my choice to eat dinner here, but with so many good reviews, I figured there might be something that was appealing. After we were seated, our server brought us menus right away and drinks came quickly along with the nacho appetizers we ordered for the table. That part of the meal was fine-no complaints here. Nachos were run of the mill-not bad but nothing stellar. It turned out that I was glad these were ordered, because my actual meal was terrible. I ordered the Veggie burger-on the menu it's clear this is not an ordinary veggie burger. It comes topped with \"roasted\" veggies-Portobello, zucchini, peppers and onions. On paper that sounded good but the execution was lacking. The veggies were flavorless, soggy and oily. The veggie patty itself didn't seem well cooked and had an odd taste to it. The fries it came with were okay-nothing that stood out-adequate but the disappointment in the veggie burger itself outweighed any goodness there. I'm sure the kitsch value of this place has value to some people but for me this a waste of time, money and an opportunity to have a good meal after a long day of adventures in Vegas. Never again."}
{"text":"To say that our experience at Hard Rock was anything short of awful would be an understatement. We wondered in here on a Friday night expecting a wait but were greeted with a half empty restaurant. We were taken to the back of the restaurant, past multiple unoccupied tables, and seated in the back corner away from everything. We were told our waitress would be there in a second. About 20 minutes later, after asking the hostess if we had a waitress, she shows up and rudely greets us with \"what do you guys want to drink?\". We all ordered water and another 15 minutes passed before we received the water. We decided to place our orders then with expectations it would take a decade to receive. We weren't disappointed as it took well over 30 minutes for the food. After such a wait you would expect fine dining worth of only 5 stars... we were disappointed again. The food was average at best and the chicken tenders were more of breaded chicken pancakes. The fastest part of our night was receiving the check which wasn't shocking at all. We will not be returning to this establishment any time we're in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Kyle was a wonderful server! The food was delicious and the service unmatched! Thank you Kyle for making our \"not so great night\" wonderful! Viva Las Vegas! Hard Rock style"}
{"text":"When in Phoenix for a conference, my friend and I visited the Hard Rock Cafe. It's located across from the stadium so very convenient on game nights, but also close to the PHX Convention Center where our conference was.   We went at lunch and there was little to no crowd, so we were seated immediately by a great guy named Cody who works in the gift shop as well as waits on customers.   It was my friend's first visit to Hard Rock and Cody made it special for both of us. He gave us lots of details about the food. She ordered the chicken strip appetizer and he told her that it was kind of spicy- she's not a spicy fan, so he had the cook serve her the kid's version of the chicken tenders instead. I got the grilled veggie sandwich, which was on texas toast and had mushrooms and veggies and lots of cheese. Mine also came with fries, but you can upgrade to a salad or onion rings. I wasn't super hungry, so my friend and I shared the fries.   Our food was great, and we also bought some gifts. HRC even has a few clearance items and they have cute shirts, including ladies cut. The shirts were some of the best PHX souvenirs we saw for the price. The service was quick and we were finished and back at our conference without having to wait too long, and of course the atmosphere was typical Hard Rock Cafe with lots of great music.   I would definitely return to this Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"Darn, I apparently missed the Yelp check in deal, because none showed up when I checked in!  Boo hoo!   But, it's okay, we were there for breakfast on a free gift card from our lodging location.  Did you know Hard Rock Cafe had breakfast??  I didn't even realize it until I got the gift card!  But, we ended up skipping the breakfast items and went straight for some comfort food after a hard night of drinking the night before!  I had the potato skins and they were pretty good.  You know potato skins are hit and miss, sometimes delish and other times nasty, these were good, some of them better than others and a fair amount of toppings (cheese bacon and onions) on top, served with sour cream.  It hit the spot though.  The husband had chicken tenders with spicy sauce and he did not complain.  Our server was friendly and attentive and we were in and out pretty quick.    I'm a big fan of the Hard Rock locations because I LOVE the memorabilia, so I took a few minutes to walk around and peek at the goodies on the walls.  Good stuff and a good visit.  Will totally go back, especially since this location is just around the corner from my time share."}
{"text":"Must have got them on a good night. Food was perfect!  Music was great. The crowd was a little dead but I wouldn't contribute that to the food. I will say that people may be over Hard Rock Cafe or at least live music. Not sure why. But a great experience tonight!"}
{"text":"Amy,our server was awesome and the wings were on point!! The rest of the meal was good (we had burgers) but the stand out dish was for sure the wings. They were perfectly crunchy and not over-sauced. Though, their classic rock buffalo sauce is good enough that if the wings were swimming in it, it'd be ok. Definitely a don't miss"}
{"text":"Though they advertise their burgers as 'legendary' they were bland and tasteless, a $15 burger I could only stomach half of.  Even the A1 sauce I needed to ask for couldn't mask the cheapness of the meat.  The side house salad was good, and the atmosphere at the bar was pretty nice.  2 stars, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Another first time experience... Tasty breakfast and quick service. Wish there was more bacon. Everyone loves bacon! :)"}
{"text":"I got here around 6:00 pm with my family. Was seated instantly and the staff was really nice and polite. I ordered the Original Legendary Burger, and it was delicious. The meat was cooked just well, the topping were amazing. I would definitely recommend for everyone, really family friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome view, great food and music! I am fan now and will return to this place the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came in one night for a concert, but I was early. Which was okay as I hadn't eaten since breakfast so I needed food before booze. So I took a seat at the bar and ordered.  I had a SOB Burger, which is a cheeseburger with guac and chipotle. It was kind of uninspiring as far as a burger goes - massive, but I felt like the chipotle flavor was played down. Also it fell apart after the first couple of bites - to be fair, I think they anticipated it, they gave me a big ass steak knife to go with it. The fries were really good.  Alcohol: I gave up drinking after the first two rounds, because my draft Newcastle Ale was 5.60. Don't drink on the Strip if you're a local, you will always be disappointed. The bartender was attentive to my needs and cashed me out quickly.  The Concert: The real reason to come here is that the third floor is a MASSIVE concert space. It's a really nice venue, and they've been booking really interesting gigs. The bar service looked good, but like I said, I quit indulging after dinner so I don't know about the service/prices."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on a whim. First time there, and I can't say it was impressing. It's a little too cluttered with all the decorations. They're interesting to look at. It just gets overwhelming. We were there when an amateur live band was playing. Thankfully we were outside - WAY too loud for an eating experience. The staff do the job, but it seems to be that we were inconveniencing them. The food is excellent. The chicken Caesar salad could use a little more chicken and the option of putting your own dressing on. The price seems a little expensive, so I can't say that I would go back in a heartbeat..."}
{"text":"I had not been to Hard Rock in a couple of years.  I can say that the menu has expanded and much more creative than the last time that I was there.  I had lunch there on a Friday afternoon.   The restaurant was fairly full.  The music was pretty loud which is ok since it is Hard Rock.  I ordered the Haystack Chicken salad which was pretty good.   The saladl combines fresh mixed greens, carrots, corn, pico de gallo, shredded cheese and grilled chicken breast (fried chicken tenders are also available. The salad came with with ranch dressing and topped with spiced pecans and tortilla straws.   The salad was huge, the ingredients were fresh.   The ranch dressing was pretty bland and watery, but really didn't matter because the salad was very flavorable, on it's own.   Our server was very attentive, consistently filling our glasses, brought extra napkins etc.   The only downside was that the restaurant was collecting for some type of fundraiser, so on top of the loud music, one of the employees kept making annoucements requesting donations.   Other than that, all was pretty ok.   I would return to try other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Good food, good service in a fun atmosphere.  Lots of tasty options to choose from make.  Good kids menu too!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend wanted to eat here for her birthday weekend, and it was very close to our hotel. Went in and experienced no wait time and also got outside balcony seating. Our server was great, very friendly and saved us a couple bucks by offering the bottomless drink and a refill on her margarita. We both got the pulled chicken sandwich and wow, it was SO good. I wasn't that hungry but as soon as I tasted it, it was gone in seconds. Would definitely recommend. I got the Bahama Mama bottomless drink and it was dangerously good. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all, and she got a berrygarita and she also loved it. Our drinks also came with free glasses so that was pretty neat to take home with us! I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I bought a vouncher at Tix4Tonight which gives you 20% off.  I didn't realize it would be good only for this location until after I bought it.  Hubby and I just ordered burgers and the potato skins appetizer.  The potato skins were really good.  The burgers disappointed though.  It wasn't really the taste, but they came out cold.  I touched my bacon, cold, then lifted up my burger and touched the middle, cold, not even luke warm.  Not cool at all, but I am not a whiny complaining person and I didn't want someone's spit in my burger if I sent it back so I just ate it.  Hubby's burger was cold too, I didn't touch it so I can't comment on whether or not it was lukewarm or like mine.  Our waitress was ok, took a while for her to come to our table when we first sat down, she seemed very busy.  The place was semi busy on a Saturday night.  We got seated right away and the restaurant was very clean.  If I came back, it wouldn't be by choice, I will stick with the Hard Rock location on Harmon and Paradise.  We had much better food that was actually hot and excellent service there."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing! Everything was perfectly prepared, and came out quickly. What initially attracted  us to the place was the $15 bottomless mimosas, and our server Tex kept them coming. There was a live musician playing, just an enjoyable patio breakfast. Shoutout to Tex for being so prompt and awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Foods is good, but the view is better.  The reason to dine in at this place is because it is on the Strip--across from New York, New York and the Park (the old Monte Carlo).    Ever since they built the T Mobile Stadium.  They have been charging for parking in this area.  I have to get bus pass now.  $8 per day or $20 for 3 days will get me up and down the Strip to Fremont Street and Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  It is simply not worth it to drive to Vegas anymore.    I am getting old will take the bus from SGV to Vegas.  It is $30 one way.  5 hours but I do not have to drive.  I had the Rancho Huevos.  the egg and tortilla breakfast Mexican style...es buenos!  Mi llama es Ramon.  Estoy Latino.  Bueno Diaz!"}
{"text":"Come on, Hard Rock?  Seriously, you remember when it was the coolest place to go.  My son is infatuated with guitars and music, so why not.  I have to admit it was a bit for me as well.  I'm glad we went.  I even resisted, \"son under the Hard Rock signage\" photos.  He was more interested in watching Cracker set up their instruments on stage anyway.  Our order:  South of the Border Burger w/fries and side salad.  Mushroom, Grilled onions, and Cheese Burger w/fries.  Kid Macaroni  Our service was perfect.  Never waited for food, refills, or our check.  Large enough portions, we were able to bring home half. Everything was fresh and very hot.  Excellent flavor.  I was so surprised to get this quality from a chain restaurant.  Hard Rock - Pittsburgh rocked it out!"}
{"text":"Horrible hard rock. Hardly edible.   Was so pumped to go here with my family for lunch- and it was soooo bad. Don't let the food picture fool you. Food items were sour, our meals had to be sent back to the kitchen to be warmed up. It was so bad that we actually had to speak to the manager. He was great, he took some $ off the bill, and even brought my 3 year old niece a gift from the gift shop. Drinks were delicious though."}
{"text":"You know, when you are wondering up and down the strip about 9pm trying to find somewhere to eat, the glowing lights of the Hard Rock are a welcoming sight.  We were drawn like moths to a flame.  And there we were seated, we wanted outside and then I froze so they moved us inside with only a wee bit of pouting from the outside waiter dude.  Inside was a lot warmer, quite. To the point that we shared some chicken wings that were perfect - especially with the dipping sauce. Great entree, however it could have easily have been a main meal for us both!  We couldn't get through the last wing so we left it and advised the waiter that we left it for him. As his tip. Good thing he laughed with us instead of getting snarky.  I got the Texan burger, which was huge and oh soooooooooo very delish.   Granted by this time we were already into our 2nd cocktail so everything was great!  When we paid we were advised that we could pick up our cocktail glasses from the counter downstairs... Wait! What?  That's right lovelies, they forget to mention that you earn yourself a nice little memento from getting drunk on cocktails!! WIN! (and to make this even better it made it all the way back to Sydney without breaking, double win!)  All in all, great food... great booze and waiters that laugh with you."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Hard Rock and never really had the desire to but we had some time to kill after checkout and before the flight, so I thought, why not?  Well for one the food is way too expensive for the quality.  It was definitely nothing special.  It was neat to finally be in a Hard Rock though and I did enjoy seeing the KISS members when I walked in.  =)  But the food was subpar and my mixed drink had little floaties in it, that I think were supposed to be there, but were distracting and gross.  I can't say I will be going to another Hard Rock anytime soon."}
{"text":"The outside was very dark. The only lights on we're on the guitar itself.   We weren't even sure it was open till we went inside.  We waited to be seated and no employees were to be seen.  There were  hardly any customers inside which is very unusual for a HRC.  We actually left and went somewhere else for dinner. It was not a good sign when you don't see any employees and the resturant has very few customers."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in any town with a Hard Rock, I have to stop. I have a huge Hard Rock Beer Glass collection that I constantly have to add to. On this particular trip to Vegas, I was traveling with my son. We were celebrating his birthday and it was a work function...so a win win for us both.   We were staying at the Wynn and took a taxi to the Hard Rock. We enjoyed the casino and the restaurant. It was the first time at the casino part of a Hard Rock, so believe me I enjoyed that part of it. Didn't win anything major here but at least broke even. Once I locate the photos I will upload to the review.   We had a great time and will definitely enjoy this one again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great drink specials for breakfast and great dinner food. Service was spot on and visited this location 3 times already during my Vegas trip."}
{"text":"We got here around 11 pm on a Friday night. It wasn't busy at all, yet we never got a offered a food menu or even a chance to ask for one from the bartender. We had to awkwardly ask our neighbors if we could borrow one of theirs. We never even got asked if we needed anything else drink wise or checked in on at all. There were 5 or 6 different bartenders on. With how slow it was there was no reason for us to be neglected for something as basic as offering a food menu. The food did come fast and the girl that brought our food to us was super nice though."}
{"text":"Reviewer # 488  I don't get the hype, or the prices. Yes, it's on the strip and yes they have iconic stars outfits, such as Britney Spears, on display, but that's about it. The prices are super high. Yes, it's Vegas and to be expected, but much higher than they should be I feel.  Nevertheless, if you're a hard rock fan, then the prices are well worth it. The food was average tasting, the drinks were \"okay\" and the service, well the service was pretty bomb, I'll give you that. The waitress made this place fun and spunky.   Head downstairs and visit the hard rock shop. WE took photos of the lady that encouraged us to come in and eat. She did a good job and was very friendly. I am glad we went. Nothing mind blowing, but good customer service makes everything better."}
{"text":"Our server, Michael, was super friendly and very helpful.  Our food was delicious. Pulled pork BBQ sandwich for my husband and pulled BBQ chicken for me both became with fries, baked beans and a citrus coleslaw. We shared a side salad and that was more than enough food. We didn't realize the portions were so generous.  Hubby had a Stella and I had a Strawberry Basil Lemonade which was just the right mix of tangy and sweetness and totally refreshing."}
{"text":"Honestly did not like this Hard Rock. Great location and that is about it. The one in Niagara Falls beats this by miles.  We sat down on a Saturday night after waiting in what seemed to be a non existent line for 20 minutes. After finally being seated, we realized that the restaurant wasn't packed at all! Just really limited amount of workers.  The air condition was blasted and after waiting again what seemed like forever, the food came and it was cold as well. (See photo of cold cheese on a cold burger with a cold side of fries...)  Not recommended! Although Yonge & Dundas is such a touristy spot, there are other good \"chain restaurants\" if you need to choose from one... Joeys and even the 3 Brewers next door are so much better.  Only redeeming quality is the Hard Rock store where you can see some old records and signed posters."}
{"text":"The view of the Strip from the patio is awesome, and the chicken nachos (appetizer) were great-definitely a shareable portion!"}
{"text":"Came in before the Kenny Cheney concert we knew it was going to be busy but we also knew we wanted to have dinner before. We got there at 4 and was told an hour wait which was fine. After 30 minutes of waiting 3 people deep at the bar I was able to order drinks the bar tender was quick once she got to me! I've worked at a busy restaurant during times like this and know they were working their butts off! At an hour we were told we were next and they were bussing tables, after 15 more minutes there were 12+ clean open tables and they weren't seating anyone! The crowd had dies down as the concert had started but again we wanted to eat! We saw 3 ladies seat them selfs and told the manager they weren't leaving there were so many opened tables so I under stand the manager being bitchy to them. The host lets a lady in my party know she is pushing tables together for my party of 6 so after she does while the host is grabbing menus we sit down, we knew it was our table. The manager runs over to us and starts yelling at us and saying who sat you? Who told you you could move tables? We tell her the host did and she VERY snobby says then why don't you have menus? We let her know the host was grabbing them and we see her stomp up to the host and start screening at them. She comes back and starts putting knifes on the table and when she gets to me that let her know we waited an hour and a half and we did not seat our selfs she SLAMS my knife down and walks away. We all were in shock! I don't know how this lady ever has to deal with any customer she should not be interacting with anyone! Maybe she can be the late night manager that deals with the drunks at last call but she should NEVER work treat customer that are there for dinner that way! We ordered right away drinks and food the server was kind, food and drinks were fast. Again I've worked in way busier restaurants than this and I know host have to stop seating if the kitchen can't keep up but this was 100% not the case! This is the smallest Hard Rock I have ever been to so why they didn't seat anyone with a lot of open tables? The only thing I could think is they were hoping shift changes? The girl manager with short blonde hair should move to kitchen manager because you can be a bitch to your staff in the back of the house but being that way in the front and to customers should get you fired!! Again once we were sat we enjoyed our service but that doesn't do anything to make up for who you choose to have representing your company.   *** the GM retched out to me and it was nice to talk to him I hope this makes a difference for other customers and they are treated with respect."}
{"text":"As the Hard Rock Cafe is my all time favorite restaurant,  I will always give it five stars. At this location, if you sit downstairs, it's actually not super loud and you can actually have a conversation. And order the California Burger. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food and drinks! The waitress went over and above! The atmosphere was fun! They had live music playing. The hurricane drink was fantastic and had lots of alcohol for the price. We sat outside on a 100 degree day and it was still nice. Highly highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I don't eat at chain restaurants because I know they suck.  But we were in Las Vegas and we figured if there is any place to do some typical tourist crap, Las Vegas would be the place to do it.  My boyfriend had never been to a Hard Rock Cafe and so we decided that compared to the other places on the strip this would be somewhat in our price range and we wouldn't get hassled since we look like weirdos.  The place is neat, the weird cyber interactive stuff is cool maybe all Hard Rocks have those now, I don't know but it was fun looking at the kind of memorobelia that appealed to us at our table.  It was also fun voting for the music that would be played next, but we kept getting beaten out.  The service was meh.  Stupid jokes from the waitress asking us what band we were in.  Yes, because obviously if we were in a band and playing in Las Vegas we'd totally be eating at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip... ugh.  Also, this was kind of annoying - my boyfriend's ID picture is really old when he was younger, chubbier, and just had his wisdom teeth out, so in a word he looks kinda bad.  He's aware of that.  The waitress I guess in an attempt to... I don't know make him feel better?  Went on and on and on about how she shouldn't even accept the ID because it looks nothing like him now and how's he's gotten way more attractive... wtf?  The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.  My food was one degree above cold and my boyfriends food ended up making him sick.  The waitress never came back with condiments we asked for and we considered doing a runner because it was taking so long to get the check... and we were one of six occupied tables....  So all and all avoid this place if you can.  I've been to many a Hard Rock in my life, but this was the worst as far as food and service go.  One of the best as far as decor go.  Take it for what you will."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Waitress actually sat at table at talked to customers for 15 minutes before even coming over to take our drink order."}
{"text":"i've been here several times and have had their breakfast, burgers and bites.    the first time i came was the very week i moved to las vegas.  the hostess was extremely friendly and gave me all kinds of great information for a new resident.  the waitress heard i just moved here, and let me know that locals receive a discount.  the food was good - average but good - but i thought it was quite overpriced.  each time i visit, i am really impressed by the service.  my waiters and waitresses have always been very friendly with very quick service and anticipate my needs (more water without being asked, etc.).  however, the last time i went, we all ordered some drinks that were featured for summer, where you have to press the container and then pour the drink into your glass.  none of us could taste the alcohol.  not at all.  when we were finished, we did  not even feel like we drank a drop of alcohol.  these drinks were, in our opinion, very expensive, and not worth it.  i will probably be back, as my out of town guests always like to visit it, but i prefer to eat at local haunts where i get more bang for my buck and can enjoy the nice buzz you get from a few reasonably priced cocktails."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, I had the \"duo\" combo with ribs & brisket and my wife has the pulled pork sandwich. We were both pleased. Not as much memorabilia as other HRCs but still interesting, including Roy Orbison's motorcycle."}
{"text":"Typical HRC.. Smaller than average but friendly bartender and very personable retail shop cashier and drinks were perfect. It's located right on the river. Not much in the way of memorabilia.  You really can't expect anything different after visiting so many of these. Glad I checked it out but I'm thinking there's much better bars in the big city of Pittsburgh to visit my next time back there."}
{"text":"The visit to this HRC was pleasant. We sat at the bar. Our bartender Nikki was very personable and fun to joke with and very attentive. The food we had was delicious and prompt.  The retail store clerk was ok, but after asking for 2 Hard Rock Cafe Cleveland pins, we discovered at home a couple days later that we were given 1 Cleveland pin and 1 Hollywood pin. Really? Why were Hollywood pins even stocked there?. That was a disappointment as I don't buy things from places I've never been. The parking can be rough. I had to go around the block a couple times before I scored a spot.  Overall I'd be back if I ever felt the need to go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were attending the Tuesday Blend that was held upstairs on the 3rd floor that's at the top of both the store and restaurant. We got to Tuesday Blend pretty darn early around 10 to where there were no people on the dance floor or anything, so I basically persuaded/pushed my boyfriend to go downstairs and go get some appetizers/food just to kill time and also because we never tried it. So we went downstairs and the staff was so friendly. Passing through Hard Rock, the restaurant always looks nice on the outside, but actually sitting and being there was a lot nicer than I expected. I wanted to sit at the bar because I assume that's always the quickest service, but we actually got a window seat, which was perfect... better than the bar area and we just people watched. We got quick service with a nice waiter with funny and nice coworkers who all seemed to get along very well, which is good for them and the job itself. Anyhow we ordered two burgers. I don't remember the name, but I believe my boyfriend got something mushroom(?) and I got something jalapeño(?), but it was so delicious. The meat was cooked perfect! The meat wasn't hard like some other restaurants and it didn't taste like it was right out of the freezer or anything. It tasted so fresh and so juicy. Food was good. Customer service was cool. Environment/atmosphere was chill. Window seat was amazing. If we ever go to Tuesday Blend again, I wouldn't be surprised if we stopped by the restaurant again. :)"}
{"text":"Date night at Hard Rock! Bill our service was impeccable, food was great, and we always live the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"... we spent about an hour-twenty here.  So I'm told.  We INTENDED to catch a cab after lunch at Hofbrauhaus across the street [http://www.yelp.com/biz/hofbrauhaus-las-vegas#hrid:LFSpiDUZx54FA6cK7oTi9g], BUT \"hey, let's catch a cab!\" somehow turned into \"hey, let's do shots!\"  So I'm told.  ... which turned into 5 rounds of shots.  So I'm told.  But inside that hour-twenty, the packed restaurant, with its Rock history paraphenalia and memorabilia is entertaining.  Throw in a dozen televisions, blaring music, and impromptu staff/customer singalongs and a good time is sure to be had. ___________________________________________ Singalongs to \"YMCA\" and \"Greased Lightening\" involve table dancing and bootie-shaking.    So I'm told."}
{"text":"Hard Rock cafe is always a fun experience. The decor is great and the atmosphere is very nice. The food is basic food. Tasty enough. Not fantastic. But it's worth visiting for a nice meal."}
{"text":"All about being a tourist, not someone who wants to relax and grab something to eat. First they herd you over for a washed out picture, which they try to sell you for $20.00 later, then if your lucky they sit you down. New waiter in training was awesome, the establishment let not only me down but his hard service. 1. My fork had food remaining on it from previous patron. 2. FF right out of the refrigerator ???????????? 3. Head manager who is in his own world, then after I brought it to the immediate managers attention, I was offered free desert; \"are you serious?\"  Lastly we were looking for a good lace to grab a late night snack the previous evening, they closed early for lack of Patrons? what does that tell you about this place? Totally disappointed"}
{"text":"My first time is was amazing. Second time around not so much. Service was slow and not much attention was given to the guest, not just me but ppl around me. I can't complain about the food it was great but if they could get the customer service down it can most def be a 5. Won't give up on it. I'll come back when I get a chance to do so."}
{"text":"Came in 10 min before their happy hour was over to take my mother out for her bday dinner. Wasn't allowed to get her a drink at the bar without her id (she's 65) and then the server came by only after he had already taken the full order of a group sat maybe 5 min after us and when I asked what their local legendary burger was, my server put the menu back in front of me and said \"you clearly need more time\" and walked away again. I'm local and even own a travel agency, but will steer everyone I can as far away as possible. I could handle the prices if there was actually service but this place makes me want to go to McDonald's. You should be ashamed of the service"}
{"text":"This place is MASSIVE, like seriously one of the largest restaurants in Vegas (on the strip). Its on the third floor I think and just go without a reservation, you will very very likely get a table. You can easily get lost in that place. Burgers are 15 bucks and very good and filling. They have truffle fries too and its all tasty. Other entrees like steak and stuff are more expensive obviously and average around high 20's to low 30's. I didn't really know what to expect from Hard Rock Cafe but it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Meh...  The location and building are nice and they have some outdated music paraphernalia. They are located on a patio by the water and have an outdoor patio overlooking a dancing fountain.  The food here tastes cheap.... and the options are the same as other family restaurants.  My service was OK except that they wanted me to pay ahead and hold my credit card so I wouldn't run away without paying for my food..."}
{"text":"One person ordered the gluten free bun and he said it was the best gluten free bun he have ever had. Service was great. Our waiter, Shane, was very attentive and we never needed for anything. I ordered the chicken arugula salad.  It was very tasty and there was a good portion of each ingredient. My only complaint would be it was slightly heavy on the dressing (pre mixed). I would order it again."}
{"text":"What a wonderful time we had! Our server, Michelle (Shelly) was amazing!!!!!! She was handling our large group with ease and such a great attitude! She attended to my shellfish allergy and checked on me and assured me all was prepared separately. Her outgoing personality but personal level of service and professionalism was refreshing. Oh yeah, there was food too...I remember years ago having the \"best burger I ever had.\" It was at the Hard Rock Café in Boston. I ordered it again at this location and yup, it is awesome! The cheddar cheese was melted just right...the way it looks in pictures but you never actually get that in reality. Welp, it was a reality...a yummy gooey reality! We will be back fo' sho'! Thanks Shelly!"}
{"text":"I can only speak of the third floor concert venue, so you're on your own if you decide to actually eat at their restaurant. Godspeed!  It's definitely a good place to check out a show, particularly if it's general admission, as ours was.   There will be confusion when you arrive and try to decide where they woud possibly have a concert in this damned t-shirt shop. Fear not. Walk to the back of the t-shirt shop and go up the stairs. The line will form beginning at the top of those stairs at second floor level (the restaurant).  Once the \"doors\" open, you'll move up another flight to the 3rd floor venue.  If the show is 21+ you *must* have ID. Yes, even you, you old son of a bitch. Even you. There's a pretty intense search, then you're in.  I hope your fellow audience members are as chicken shit as ours were. Most of them lingered in the back by the bar and windows, leaving the entire floor open for the taking. We opted to take about 15 square feet touching the stage, right in front of the lead singer's microphone. We saw Psychedelic Furs this night. I posted a pic taken from our piece of land. Pretty darned impressive! I never thought I'd have Richard Butler sweat on me, but I'll be damned if that didn't happen.   The chicken shits soon realized, \"oh, hey, it sure would be cool to be down there in front\" and they tried to commandeer our space. No way, chumps.  Good acoustics. I wouldn't hesitate to see another show here."}
{"text":"My fiance and I picked this place for our wedding reception.  Our reception took place yesterday 10.28.16 We had the pleasure to plan everything with Christy, she was the best! She was Sooo fast and Sooo helpful. She answered every single question we had no matter how ridiculous it was. She was simply the best.   On the day of the reception...WOW!!!!! This place was AMAZING! The set up was great!! The staff was amazing and the food was great! Tessy was beyond the best person there!  She was very helpful and explained everything to us. Anything we needed, she was there in a heartbeat. She was really lovely and I thank God she was there to help me with everything for this reception.   Along with the staff being so great, our DJ chad was beyond the best, I was able to email him ahead of time and give him a small list of music we requested and he was great! So helpful and so flexible about the music.  I couldn't he happier, everything was great, I will 100% recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"I'm usually the type that goes to a restaurant and order the same thing because I know what it taste like and how i like it or what to expect, but I always order something different every time i come here because I know I'll like it one way or another. This restaurant can get a little pricey, but its still awesome. We've been here a few times, mainly when family or friends come down to visit. If customer service is a big deal to you as it is to me, then you're in luck.. their customer service was awesome.  There is a gift shop on the first floor. Its small, but has plenty of souvenirs. Seems like shot-glasses are the thing to buy these days..."}
{"text":"We came here after an inexpensive afternoon at the Eaton centre. Was gonna buy another Omega watch from European jewellers but reined myself back to reality.   Non the less. . The restaurant was a good time. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was fun and vibrant with the memorabilia from all sorts of music legends. For the 2 of us the bill came to around $75 including a good tip. The food was great. Burger and spiced fries and a grilled chicken sandwich and spiced fries and 2 desserts. .  All amazing.  Got a taste of them hard rock. . . Now I want the fill experience of the one in LA...   PS: manager James came around to the tables while we were there,  introduced himself and ensuring all was good with the meal and experience.  After thinking about the stars I was going to give the HRC,  I'm going to give a 5. James pushed it over the edge with that little personal touch of welcome and manager interaction with the customers"}
{"text":"We just had burgers here, but they were REALLY good!! Super fresh and hot, and the service was very good. The only reason for only 3 stars was the price. Way too expensive for what we got!  Our bill was close to $50.00 for two burgers and 1 soda."}
{"text":"Ok so nothing is free in Vegas they say...but the friendly staff and the great conversation and humor really hit the spot after walking the strip!!!!  The food was amazing!! My husband had the big cheeseburger, it was good but a bit messy and it could have used pepper jack cheese to send it up a notch!!! I had the pulled chicken..called The Texan, it had fried onion strings on it and fried jalapeños also!!! It was super tasty and I would definitely get it again!!! The others with us had food that ranged from burgers to pulled pork!!! Not a complaint in the bunch!!! Definitely a return trip is in order:)"}
{"text":"Service was kind of slow for it only being about 3 PM, but our waiter was really friendly and the food tasted great!"}
{"text":"Paid $195 to watch March Madness here for one day in 2018. There was a long line to get in. The event is on the top floor. We were able to download a gambling app to place bets, which was really convenient. Pretty basic beers available for the event. The food was a little disappointing. The breakfast had eggs and other standard breakfast items. I read about the delicious breakfast burritos, but apparently one of the chefs was out sick, so not available on the day that I was there. Lunch and dinner are the same. For $195 I was expecting a change. Not pictured are the pizza and the chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas were pretty much the best thing to eat.  There were plenty of big screen TVs to watch all of the games. There was really great energy from the crowds and no one was getting out of hand. The bathroom had a valet, which wasn't really necessary. I probably won't be going back. Watching 12 hours of basketball gets to be a little much.  Overall, a nice place to watch March Madness on the strip, but not enough variety in their food served."}
{"text":"We went to HRC in Las Vegas.  I guess it has been moved from the hotel to the strip which a very large two story facility's.  One of the largest I have ever been to.  If you sit outsie, do not sit outside around 3pm as the sun will be right in your face.  The staff as usual was absolutly terrific.  Very friendly and great to deal with.  The food was the usual ok.  We had the BBW three plate sampler.  A little over done, a little not done, typical HRC food.  You go there for the atmoshere, the scene, the pins and all things HRC!  It is awesome is is now on the strip!  :)"}
{"text":"I was in town and wanted someplace to cool off and the HRC was close to where I was.  I went and found this HRC to be very pleasant.  The staff was tremendous.  Very friendly at the door and being seated.  The server was also very friendly and helpful.  The staff gets 5 stars!  We had the Ribs and Chicken Combo.  The food has come a long way in the 30+ years I have been going to the HRC.  The ribs were very tasty and had enough BBQ sauce in where it was not dry.  The chicken was actually moist and tasty as well.  Chicken seems to be a crutch for all establishments.   Very simple dish, but one of the hardest to cook and cook well.  The Fry's were done perfect.  The two downfalls were the salad and desert.  The salad was very small and nothing to it and we paid extra for that.  When you pay for a salad that is not included in the meal, you expect a decent sized salad.  This was not.  The desert (Apple Cobbler) was not cooked all the way.  The pastry dough was still dough.  Ugggggg!  I would have given my visit three stars instead of 4, but the service and entree were quite good.  Good memorabilia displayed as well."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this, but as a Vegas local this place has horrible customer service.  First it's hard to get to and you have to pay $10 to park here and now that they closed the original off the strip location by the hotel this is your only option now and that just sucks!  Even when it's slow like today (after I spent close to $300 in their shop) it took me 20 min. to even see the waiter.  The food and drink order went in and we got our food quickly, but our drinks didn't come till after our food was half way gone and the bottle they gave me without even asking for a glass.  Not a bad option if you're a tourist and walking by, but locals aren't treated too well around here and there are too many other options for us!"}
{"text":"The new Hard Rock Cafe is awesome!!! Got a chance to see Eve 6 last night and was impressed with the venue.  Basically, the new Hard Rock Cafe is a three-tier building of Rock-N-Roll fun.  First floor is the walk-in HRC store with all the cool shirts, hats, sweaters, etc.  Quick escalator ride up to the second floor and your in the cafe.    I personally didn't get a chance to grab a bite, but I've eaten at the Maui, Miami, and old Vegas cafes and have never been disappointed (definitely review update).  Take the stairs or elevator up to the third floor and you've reach the concert venue.    The top floor offers a great outdoor balcony with a splendid view of the Vegas strip.  There is a large bar located on one side of the room and various locations with shot girls.  The VIP side of the venue also offers free Coors Light and Blue Moon brew for the opening acts.  Overall, I had a fantastic time and look forward to catching another event at the Hard Rock Cafe soon."}
{"text":"clearly the representative of the HRC did not comprehend what I wrote in my review so let me be clear.   1. I did in fact park at the HRC. 2. I was in fact going to eat dinner at the HRC. 3. I simply went to purchase two tickets from Vinyl first..That would make me a patron of both the HRC and the HRH. 4. If parking is such an issue, you should have someone at the entrance enforcing your rules. 5. Up until 3 days ago, HRC was always where we eat then going to events at the HRH so now you have lost a regular customer for life. Hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"I really did enjoy myself here, I am not a diehard Hard Rock Café fan, but I was impressed by the service and the food.  When we arrived here, it was a Saturday around lunchtime, we had a small wait to be seated.  Be warned, I believe almost every Saturday they have a band playing on the stage.  If  you are not interested in seeing/hearing the band ask to be seated in the room off of the main dining area or outside.  When we were seated, our drink orders were taken promptly and we were given time to look over the menu.  I know it's a chain restaurant but I think their menu is quite good.  I opted for their Local Legendary burger.  Each Hard Rock has one of these and it is inspired by the host city.  Pittsburgh's Local Legendary was basically a deconstructed pierogi on a burger.  Basically it is their thick burger patty topped with a nice sized portion of mashed potatoes, caramelized onions, melted provolone cheese, and a nice dollop of sour cream.  The burger was so big that I had to cut it half to try and devour it.  The burger is cooked to your liking and comes out with a nice sized serving of seasoned fries and dipping sauce.  Needless to say that the toppings on the burger began to fall off, but that led to a special treat on the plate that I needed to use the fork for.  This burger alone would have me coming back over and over again.  Décor in here is typical for the Hard Rock brand, so if you have the time and the restaurant isn't crowded, you can take your time to look at the items.  If not, just keep coming back over and over again.    Of course there is a merchandise section that sells the typical Hard Rock Café trinkets that you come to expect from any of their restaurants.  Eating outside is a nice treat, especially if the fountain is on in Station Square.  Something to note, if you are a diehard Hard Rock Café fan, they do have a rewards program that you can use at their restaurants, hotels and casinos."}
{"text":"Not great, not bad.  The location is right in the heart of the city, and it blends nicely with the rest of the neighborhood.  I was disappointed to see a relatively small amount of memorabilia, and none of it too significant.  The only really cool item was a Keith Moon t shirt.  The food was it's reliably good self.  HRC makes a great burger and their salads are always fresh.  Service was prompt and got it done.    No wait for a table, and no long wait for food or drink were both appreciated.  Just a bit overpriced, but I suppose it IS downtown Toronto.  Will likely not be back, got my pin, lots of other choices in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and ended up sitting at the bar because it was packed! Ordered some appetizers and got 2 dollar drafts because it was during a march madness game. That alone was worth it! Our bartenders Todd and Sunshine were great and gave us some good of strip locations to go to after dinner! I will definitely head back this way when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"We were there May 23rd for lunch we had such poor service the waitress messed up our very simple order of burgers. And we were brought cold food and the serve was no where to be found. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's hard to elaborate on my underwhelmingly average experiences I've had here time and time again. The early 2000's music videos and Blondie paraphernalia lathering the walls was enough to distract me from the over-priced, bland entrees. My credit wasn't good enough to take out a second mortgage to afford one of their cocktails, so I can't comment on those.  However, the word that this place is closing in a couple months filled me with nostalgic comfort. I'm relieved I won't be dragged here by my comrades any longer, and it's good for Hard Rock that they're focusing their efforts on the way more profitable Rocksino. I have not, and will not, be a patron at that facility for a number of reasons, including but not limited to fear of sparking an unwelcomed gambling addiction or the possible employment of an ex-girlfriend. I could never say no to the Cafe, though, being a music lover and it being filled with rock and roll memorabilia had me constantly holding onto that hope that it would become the place I always wanted it to be, but that yearning was never fulfilled.  I will return before it closes, to purchase a soon-to-be relic \"Hard Rock Cleveland\" tee shirt that I can pass on to future generations along with the fables of how it used to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Hard Rock since I was 14 or 15... back in the days when it was SUPER cool to sport your Hard Rock Orlando t-shirt, much to the envy of your banana-clip clad friends. I was tasked over Thanksgiving with finding a joint that we consider to be \"mom-friendly\", since my Mom isn't really a foie gras and fondant kind of lady. I actually hate foie gras too, but you get the idea. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was at the Hard Rock Cafe at Station Square. Can you believe it? The fries were great and the music wasn't too loud. This is the best decision when you don't want to go to one of the 7 sports bars the area offers to unhappily wedge yourself in a sea of beer-soaked Steelers jerseys. Big up to the Hard Rock! I almost bought a t-shirt just for the camp factor."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high but the food is great and the shows are fun!"}
{"text":"Très bon et accueil parfait"}
{"text":"We have been to the Hard Rock Cafe couple time before we go to a concert or game at US Airways. Hard Rock is a chain, which i typically like trying new and local places but its still really good food and drinks. Last visit we shared the 3 sample plate of BBQ (Chicken, Pork and Ribs). Lots of food for the price and you can easily share the plate."}
{"text":"Ok, I think everyone has been to the Hard Rock so there is nothing too much I can add that everyone doesn't already know.  Fun atmosphere, great hospitality, yummy food...but the reason for my writing this review is to let you know about their OREO CHEESECAKE!  O-M-G! Just get it!  It truly sets you on a splendid journey to heaven!  P.S. I never order deserts but I got lucky when someone else ordered this.   :)  Hope you like it too!  :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. There's a ton of music themed displays and memorabilia. The service is good and reasonably fast.  I started with a dinner salad. It's was very small but tasted good.   I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye with mashed potatoes and veggies. Here's a photo just to show you how well it was prepared. Not too fancy but it was pretty good  I will be back just because but not because it's the best O ever had."}
{"text":"After walking in the wrong door and standing for a few minutes we realized that the hostess stand was on the other side. After nobody acknowledged us we took ourselves to the other side to be seated. After finally being greeted since we were standing at the station one guy politely greeted us. After seating it took at least 10-15 minutes to even have a drink order. When ordering we asked to split a salad and it be split on two plates. Next we proceeded to order drinks and opted for the blue pina cola mixed drink.  Our server quickly brought both drinks and food and we were pretty excited to see it on the table after our quick bathroom run. Good job kitchen crew!  However it was only on one plate but no big deal he remembered two plates.   The bar tender may need to mix them a bit better...they were disgusting. Our server did try and help but the second drink was awful as well. I haven't had drinks that awful for 10 years.  Our server seemed too busy to be extremely attentive but he was okay...the person who ruined our experience was Zena. The server next two us kept running into me while my chair was close to the aisle. She also took our menu's from the chair at our table we were holding on too for dessert without asking as she talked to her table. Next she put dirty dishes on our table on top of a dirty plate that needed to be taken. It was beyond rude...we weren't too upset since there was a lot going on, tonight someone left in an ambulance. But she never came back...she could have had the curtesy at least help our server bust the table since she contributed to the dirty dishes. I mean we had several dishes that needed to be removed. I wonder if she would have been that oblivious if I had more people at the table, was a celebrity, if I was an attractive man or a white woman . She walked by us 6 times and saw our dishes .   We really liked the male hostess who made sure things were okay but by then we were ready to go. That guy is the only reason Im giving this place three stars. Yohon gets a silver star for attempt for good service considering how many tables he had.   Mediocre service. Average food. Poor drinks. Crappy Attitude of Zena. Our server seemed new so maybe he tried the best he could...Maybe he was just tired. We came from out of state to a concert and were very disappointed by this experience. But hey you get what you pay for here...the bathrooms were a 4 on a 1-10 scale. Get it together Hard Rock... Location was a couple blocks from the Q!! Needless to say...we wont be back. Stairs were dirty and just God awful music. Not very inviting at all."}
{"text":"Props to the Hard Rock Cafe, for doing exactly what I was sure they couldn't do! On our way to a Suns game, my hockey buddy and I were searching for a place to grab a quick bite to eat. We got off the light rail at 7:35, wandered until we decided to give the Hard Rock a try, and were seated right away.  Trust me, we passed a lot of options along the way to the arena. Most of them were unappealing or way too busy. One place actually told us they could seat us right away, but it would be a 45 minute wait for food... Okay, next!  Our server Lizzy was great! When she greeted us, I told her we were on our way to an 8:30 game. She was enthusiastic, promptly took our order and delivered our drinks. It was barely after 7:40 now.  It's been a while since I last visited a Hard Rock Cafe (in California). The atmosphere is still fun, especially when you appreciate the genre to which every Hard Rock is an homage. Plus, I'd forgotten the unique collection of musical items on display. Now back to the food!  It wasn't long before Lizzy appeared with our entrees. My Guinness Bacon Cheeseburger was delicious and the kitchen nailed the temp. My burger still had a little pink in the middle. My buddies nachos were generous and delicious too! Lizzy knew we were in a hurry and quickly delivered our check too. Seriously, ask for Lizzy!  I felt it was deserving to acknowledge the Hard Rock Cafe for providing great service, a fun atmosphere, tasty food and all at a lunch time pace. By the time we walked across the street, we still had time to get to our seats in time for the National Anthem. Thanks Hard Rock! 'Merica!"}
{"text":"Very Good food and excellent service.  Only issue is the price.  This place is EXPENSIVE!  We had 2 basic burgers, 2 beers and 1 mixed drink and paid $65 not including tip.  Again the only problem with going here is the cost.  The rest is gravy."}
{"text":"I would say the Phoenix Hard Rock is pretty average as Hard Rock's go. We had a nice time and enjoyed a couple of their specialty drinks while we were there.   If there is a sporting event downtown the Hard Rock is probably busier. However, most other times the downtown is a ghost town after 6. We had the place to ourself, but their wasn't much else to do in the area."}
{"text":"Long walk along the strip and I was hungry. A full rack of ribs did the trick. It wasn't too busy so I got a table right away. Service was excellent and the ribs were what I've come to expect from hard rock cafe."}
{"text":"ate lunch here last week on my Vegas trip  excellent salad and enjoy the classic Hurricane cocktail  sat the bar and the bartenders were very good, friendly and helpful  tall guy with sleeves tattoos was good"}
{"text":"What is spectacular atmosphere! Not very busy today and the breakfast was amazing. The food is scrumptious and they had everything on the televisions that we wanted to see. Once in a lifetime don't miss this opportunity come to Vegas and visit the Hard Rock Cafe!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the staff immediately, we stood at the podium waiting to be acknowledged by the guy standing there for a good 2-3 min while he was writing - couldn't stop and look up and greet us or anything so I probably should've taken that as a sign. When we were seated our server came over and asked if we were ready to order right away and we said no but I guess we should've been because she didn't show up for another 15 min. When the food came out it was decent but not worth anything near what they're charging for it."}
{"text":"We stopped by when visiting over Thanksgiving...  My sister says to give it three thumbs up because the drink was good, the food was good and it wasn't busy.  I had the dinner salad with ranch and it was actually really good for a salad. I had the nachos but they weren't too good: not enough cheese and too many chips.  My son loved the chicken mac & cheese; my mom said the pulled pork was okay."}
{"text":"For some reason I expected more out of the food, probably because it's rare to come across a Hard Rock. It is conveniently located right next to the Ritz Carlton, where we stayed in Tower City.  I wasn't that hungry and ordered a side of mac and cheese. Edible, with Velveeta cheese, but it was ok. Tasted much better with hot sauce!  My boyfriend ordered a smothered chicken dish. When the waitress came with it, she told him the kitchen ran out of mashed potatoes and replaced it with fries...without informing him first! WOW!   The food is along the range of TGIF's, Applebee's....those chains...and they're open late!   We ordered a cocktail and a couple of shots, keeping both the cocktail cup and shot glasses, which was a good souvenir.  They even had a little shop, where I bought a cute Hard Rock Couture top."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the bar. When I walked in, I was greeted kindly by the hosts and shown to the bar. I took my seat and was greeted by the bartenders on duty. I ordered gluten-free nachos off the new gluten-free menu and a vodka water. The nachos came on a huge platter enough to feed myself and three of my friends. Drink service was quick. The band was entertaining and so was the crowd. Not a bad spot to hang out on Friday night."}
{"text":"Went here right before my 21st birthday. I wasn't expecting a drink because I was not 21 yet but the waiter kept making fun of me for it. I think he was trying to be funny but I wasn't very amused at him laughing at me. However the food was very good"}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful evening, and it was lovely to sit outside and look out at the city's skyline. The waitress was also very cheerful, though didn't bring us silverware or napkins until we asked. There are very few vegetarian options (two sandwiches) and who knows if the veggie burgers were vegan or not. As it got dark, no lights came on either, so by the end of dinner, we were eating in the dark. It was a just-okay experience for dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty alright place to eat if you're into $15 burgers that fill you up, great music, mellow crowd, and patio seating has a pretty sweet view of the strip.  Service was lacking a bit though, don't know why since there weren't that many people =/  Would i come here again? Nah, one of those places you should just try. Nothing special.  Food: B Service: B Atmosphere: A"}
{"text":"Family and I brought my mother here before we had to drop her off at the airport! Had a very nice waitress, who was very courteous to us. Wife and I shared a granny apple burger, It was nothing special! Could get a better burger elsewhere! Mother had their twisted mac and cheese. She claimed it was the best she ever had? Wife and daughter agreed it was very good. I don't like mac and cheese so I never tried it. Over all food was OK! Service was very good!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Hard Rock Cafe, and I was excited about it. I mean, so much hype! We went to the one that wasn't on the strip, which was good because there was plenty of parking and not crowded at all. We ordered mixed drinks, which were fine besides the price. Then we ordered burgers- you know, typical cheeseburgers with bacon. I don't really know what happened. They were dry and didn't have great flavor. I didn't think you could mess up a burger, but just wasn't great. Service was fine, drinks were tasty and the ambiance is fun. But Vegas has WAY better food elsewhere for better prices."}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh steak salad and Pittsburgh burger were great with some Iron City! The place was far from packed but the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Breakfast is gross. Like airplane food. I can't believe it!"}
{"text":"Truly a kind hearted review of four stars. A fan of Hard Rock Cafe's it's hard to give them any less, however today's Fish & Chips should have been sent back to the kitchen. Greasy and over cooked on one side, my stomach hours later remains flip flopping and unsettled.  Yes, I will go back. But I will not be ordering the Fish & Chips."}
{"text":"I recommend that you inquire about any menu item. For example, my grilled chicken arugula salad was actually chips cuts and spinach?  It makes me wonder what they substituted for my brother's hamburger..."}
{"text":"Woke up in Vegas and said I want a steak and a drink. Well we ended up enjoying an amazing brunch at the Hard Rock Cafe right on the Las Vegas Strip. It was delishhhhhh! Steak, eggs, potatoes. With a delicious drink.  I even got to keep the cup as a souvenir! Staff was great. Food was amazing and our belly's were full. Good times. I shall return!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here for a late lunch on a Friday. Had about a 5 minute wait. Our waitress was great, she was really friendly and engaging. I ordered the raspberry mint lemonade and it was very good, super refreshing. My husband and I split the chicken ceasar salad and the nachos. The salad was good, I would have liked more dressing but it was still tasty. The nachos are HUGE. Definitely something you could split among 3 or 4 people. They come with cheese, queso sauce, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalepenos and sour cream. We also had a side order of guacamole added to them. They are really good. Down side is that the cheese hardens after the first few minutes and it seems to get cold very fast so eat quickly! Overall it was a good meal.  When we go back to Vegas we won't eat here again, it was good, just nothing that makes me want to ensure a stop there upon our next visit."}
{"text":"Luke warm french fries and crappy beer selection.  They don't have any local beers.  How is that possible?  Hard Rock is like the McDonalds of bars. If you're a tourist why go to a place that's identical to every other Hard Rock Cafe?"}
{"text":"Was just there this past weekend. The food was great and our server was awesome. I feel really bad i cant remember her name. Very cool and funny. She got the job done and even found time to joke around and be personal. I was at a table of 15 so she was amazing.   I was so happy when I remembered to check in and was greeted with 20% off from using the yelp app. It only works on food but still an awesome surprise.   I had the mushroom and Swiss burger. It was cooked perfectly but I found it to be a little greasy.  I also had a pineapple & cocoanut mojito to drink.  That was the highlight.  That ended up being nearly the same price as my meal $12.50. Also there are no prices on the menu for the drinks.  The only reason this place doesn't get 4 stars was because it was pricey. Even with my discount I still ended up spending over $33 bucks on just myself!  Crazy."}
{"text":"Average.   Good bartender and waitress.  Food average for this type of place. Plus side is there is an outdoor patio you can eat on upstairs overlooking strip.  Cool memorabilia on display and huge gift shop downstairs. Price fair for Vegas strip"}
{"text":"I came for the glass, and had a great time!  Our waitress was really sweet and attentive.  She had a LOT of energy.  I mean, a looooot.  I think she said \"rock on\" about 17 times during our meal.  At one point, she actually got into the \"superstar\" position tableside.  It was intense.  But anyway, I recommend the lettuce wraps--they were really good, but it was quite a large appetizer, so bring your appetite!  After that my friend ordered a steak w/ the twisted mac n cheese--she said the steak was REALLY good, but I only snuck bites of her delicious macaroni.  Amazing!!!  I had the grilled lemon caper chicken, and it was to die for!!  The chicken was really juice and well cooked, and the sauce on it was creamy and delicious.  The pasta that came with it was good as well.  My husband ordered the burger, and I ate most of that, too!  It was SO good!  You could tell it was good beef they were using.  Very, very good meal.  And his fries were good, too.  Not the highlight of the meal, but good nonetheless!!  Also, they had a promotion going on that if you brought your receipt downstairs and bought three t-shirts, you would get 20% off the bill.  Score!"}
{"text":"An ok touristy place to eat in a touristy section of Pittsburgh.  If you are one of those people that has to have a Hard Rock Cafe T from every place you go then I guess this is the place for you, otherwise, the food is over-priced for the quality.  There is a nice view of the dancing fountain if you are sitting outside.  There are much better restaurants in Pittsburgh where I would rather be."}
{"text":"Eggs were so buttery and tasted like they came from a bag. Coffee was awful. It's all set up for tourists and so they really don't care that the food isn't good."}
{"text":"Well I want to start by saying my rating for this restaurant is misleading. The only reason I gave this poor excuse for a restaurant the one star I did is because this app requires me to do so. I am not the least bit picky when it comes to restaurants and normally have a great deal of patience for the staff as I understand their jobs are difficult, fast-paced and demanding. Despite this attitude, I was nothing short of extremely disappointed with my experience at this location. Although the restaurant was nearly empty at lunchtime, the service was extraordinarily slow and we were greeted with an attitude reflective of a staff that was filled with bitterness and broken dreams. Even the simplest requests caused our waiter Rico (yes I wrote his name in the hope that there is not even a remote possibility of him escaping responsibility for this poor review) to treat us as if we were a burden on par with the bubonic plague. He refused to make the slightest adjustments to the menu despite our friend's preference to not have coleslaw with his meal. Splitting our check (a common practice in the age of debit cards) was seen as an insurmountable obstacle that clearly irritated Rico. I asked for a glass of water and Rico answered me in a hostile manner indicating he had already brought me some. I proceeded to correct him by informing him that the water belonged to my friend. Approximately 10 minutes later he returned with my water and slammed it on my table without so much as another word. Our food finally arrived nearly an hour after we ordered it and while the taste was passable in my eyes, nearly the rest of my party was thoroughly disappointed with the food we had wasted our valuable vacation time waiting on. So if after all this ranting you are still not convinced that the service here is not so poor that it should be reprehensible by law, at least ask not to be served by a stocky waiter with dark curly hair, a goatee, and a beanie who goes by the name of Rico. If you are asked for the reasoning behind this particular request, show the manager this review."}
{"text":"Had to go to my favorite restaurant chain. They treated me like a king  on my bday. Gave me everything I asked for and of course the food is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped on an early Saturday morning.  We made our reservations on the website as we were pulling into town.  We found easy parking at the garage.  We sat at a table on the balcony looking down at Las Vegas Boulevard. I got eggs benedict because it isn't made with cheese and my guys got a steak and the legendary burger.  I wouldn't say we come here for the food but everything was just as it should be.  Our server Nellie was very friendly and efficient.  I don't know if I'd return- because there is so much to do in LV but I would've be upset if I ended up there again.  I'd like to try the twisted Mac and cheese and a salad maybe"}
{"text":"Bruchetta was awesome.  Staff was great.  View was awesome.  Prices were ok, but it's an eatery on the strip so prices are higher.  Burger was ok....bland taste but the spicey ketchup/mayo helped.  Fries were good.  Drink prices are high but again, it's on the strip so it was expected.  Suggest a thin screen or something to block the sun in the afternoon/evening.  Overall, it was great because we saw the band's upstairs on the third floor."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from here from spoiled produce in my salad. On top of that, the service was slow and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Average Visit  It has been years since I visited the Hard Rock Cafe, even though I work in the downtown area.  Hardrock Cafe has a nice vibe and serves the typical \"American Pub\" fare, like burgers, fries, salads, and sandwiches coupled with an atmosphere of rock music and music memorabilia displayed throughout the restaurant.    Hardrock Cafe even has a store for the obligatory \"Hard Rock Cafe\" T-shirt or other Hard Rock trinkets.  The staff at HRC are friendly and accommodating and seem to really enjoy their jobs.  Each person with whom we interacted seemed genuinely interested in talking to us and making our meal and visit memorable.    On this visit my lunch companions and I ordered the Classic Hard Rock Nachos, Pulled Pork Sandwich,  Beans, Fries, Original Legendary Burger, Coleslaw, Twisted Macaroni and Cheese with Chicken, and Chicken Cesar Salad.  I have to be honest I wasn't impressed with any of the entrees. The entrees werent bad, its just that the entrees werent very good.  The Nachos were piled high, however, lacked toppings. The burger and pulled pork, once again werent bad, just average at best, nothing stood out. The Bbq beans were overcooked and dry, and the coleslaw had a bitter taste. My lunch companion said the macaroni and cheese were okay as was the Chicken Cesar Salad.   I guess I was expecting more for the price we paid and Hard Rock fell short of those expectations. I guess most people visit Hard Rock for the rock & roll atmosphere and the drinks."}
{"text":"Shit place. No acceptance in the crew. Short-thinking idiots who cant't bring a drink. Terrible music."}
{"text":"I came down to the Hard Rock Cafe in Downtown Cleveland with my sister last week.  We are practicing Catholics so during Lent every Friday we don't eat meat so we decided to come here and try their Twisted Mac and Cheese..   First, let me speak about the staff!!  The moment we walked in the staff was extremely friendly and happy!  Our server came to the table and was so much fun and a joy to be around!    Next, the food..We both got the twisted macaroni and cheese with no chicken and it was amazing!  It had a bit of a kick to it but not enough to have to guzzle down 3 glasses of water!  Seriously the BEST non homemade mac and cheese I've ever had!  Definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Went here before a Dbacks game. Our server was nice, but the food was only mediocre. We got nachos and a bunch of wings: the nachos were a bit dry and overcooked. The wings were decent but not really justified in the price.  I liked the tv's playing old music videos and the general Hard Rock Cafe feel.  I would maybe go here again but I would not go out of my way to make it over here."}
{"text":"It's OK as far as hard rocks go. Not very friendly or  knowledgeable staff to help with the artifacts there. It was too much to answer some simple questions about the place.  The jumbo sampler was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great onion rings.   Everything else was a poor experience.   Party of 3,one of their entrees was forgotten.   Was told the app would be free because of it (it wasn't).  Was told beer would be discounted,  and he knocked out all the way down to the promo price we were offered in the first place.   Also, this place is way too small.   Very crowded, making for an uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"We always hit Hard Rock. Their reward program is great and the food is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the past few years.  I've consistently been satisfied with their hamburgers and appetizers, especially the hamburger.  Today I had a NY strip steak meal. It was really good.  Good cut of steak, cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned.  I've always enjoyed the staff here.  And I love the music they play and watching the music videos on big screen.  A fun place to visit overall.  Keep in mind that it's not 5-star dining but food is tasty and a fun experience.  Oh, if you go during a dead time, like during working hours, you can park right behind the cafe and take shuttle in front of Hard Rock Cafe or Hard Rock Hotel to the strip if you want---very convenient. AND IF YOU CHECK-IN ON YELP, A COUPON FOR 20% off food only will appear on your phone and show it to your waiter.  So my meal was really $22-ish instead of $27.  I added a side-salad for $3.50 --- healthy portions."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but a little expensive.   The service is usually friendly and the restaurant is smaller, but I continue to go back anyhow.  Could be better, but definetely not bad."}
{"text":"Food here is run of the mill. Ordered a veggie burger with an onion ring, lettuce and tomato. Fries were included as a side. Since we were traveling as a large group, we had pre-selected meal options which were provided on a limited  menu. Our group arrived slightly early due to weather rearranging or schedule for the day.   Pros: -Food was served quickly with very short wait times for meals to be served. -Service was efficient and organized -Food was okay -Excellent atmosphere, views and fountain outside... Also located in a great area.  Cons: -Unclean silverware brought out twice, server finally returned with plasticware (not by request) -The attitude of our server was abismal. She was short with our group from the time of entry. Her attitude was truly among the worst that I've ever encountered when dining out. All requests made were dismissed abruptly.  -Was initially brought out the wrong burger, even though a veggie was ordered -Wasn't even offered a refill of drinks  With a city full of local staples, this is probably not on the top of the list. Especially considering the prices and service issue. Will avoid in the future and suggest that you do too."}
{"text":"We went here for nachos after the concert and of course we expected it to be busy but we got our drinks and food in a timely manner. Staff was friendly and fast! I will be returning! Oh and the nachos and onion rings were delicious! Chips were nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to a Hard Rock Cafe and this one is really nice! My friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday while attending a convention and decided to give it a try. Our server was so good and super friendly and he constantly checked in on us. The food itself? Well I ordered the shrimp, pear and goat cheese salad with spiced pecans. There was barely any goat cheese and the shrimp was just okay... The picture in the menu looked really good but the actual was just okay. I was slightly saddened by this.. My friend's mahi burger seemed much better. I will definitely either order a burger, or something else next time because I was hoping for something more. On the upside, my Arnold Palmer drink was very refreshing and good!"}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe is a pretty standard place. I love the outdoor seating at this location in the summer time, but it's winter now, eh. Went last night with some friends and sat in the dining area. I was worried it was going to be really busy but it wasn't! A band was setting up for later on and it wasn't loud at all. There was a WIDE range of people dining, formal dresses, teenagers on dates, older people, etc. good people watching!   Our waiter, Dom, was pretty cool. He kept our drinks flowing and came by often to check on us. The pulled chicken sandwich was really good, yummy BBQ sauce and the chicken was very tender. We had a bunch of drinks and they have a decent drink menu but I do think some of the cocktail prices are a little outrageous. I know it's Hard Rock but sheesh.   Anyway, we go here every once in a while and will keep going back for sure. I like Station Square a lot and the parking garage makes it easy and convenient to go to (unlike other areas of the city where parking is an annoyance)."}
{"text":"I went to las Vegas on vacations with my friend en we decided to have lunch in this location,  the ambience is nice, great decoration and style! The hostess was way too nice and sat us down immediately!  We ordered two of their burgers and they were delicious! The reasoon of my one star for this restaurant was the real bad service provided by our waitress Pixie, she literally has the worst attitude ever! If you ask her something about the menu she goes and make dirty faces! If she doesn't like being asked she shouldn't be working in customer service staff. I'm a waiter too and part of our job is to make people welcome in our pad! This lady has nothing but a serious problem of attitude!"}
{"text":"This is for their NYE party.  Should have just walked around on the strip.  What a huge waste of money!  They had 1 hour of watered down red bull and vodka.  The set up was standing around unless you paid $800-$2400 for a table for 4.  This gave you a bottle of liquor and champagne.  They supposedly had hors d'oeuvres but all I ever saw was a empty plate come quickly by with the cranky employee carrying it.   The so called champagne toast was BS - they only gad enough for half of the guest and even came out too late with it anyways.  Regardless of the cost if you do something do it right!  The HR Cafe showed they only do things half a55!  Don't waste your money here as it will be better spent elsewhere!"}
{"text":"If it were possible I would have given this place a 0 star rating.  I went in with my kids and the entire experience once we sat down was awful.  We didn't order a ton and you could tell the server didn't like that and pretty much stopped caring.  The thing is that had he cared and treated us the way any customer should be treated he would have made as much in a top if we had ordered a bunch, but since he didn't I didn't tip well.  Everything from the service to the food was terrible.  I will NEVER go back.....ever.....and I would caution others to regain as well."}
{"text":"Travis at the bar was amazing and extremely courteous!! He chated with us and gave us a local overview of Vegas!  Best bartender we came across in all Vegas!! Will definitely be coming back just to have him serve us and have him show of his craftsmanship!"}
{"text":"The reason for the five star review is that in the past I've been disappointed with various hard rock cafés. The Pittsburgh one though I think I've had one of the best burgers ever from a hard rock. Fries were great and service was actually excellent. Waitress was very helpful giving advice around town due to the fact we aren't from here. Everyone in my party was pleased with the food. We all ate different burgers and my son had the grilled chicken and broccoli (I was shocked) on the kids menu and he loved it. We were seated in about 10-15 min and we had a party of 8. Very pleased with this visit."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday morning when they were short on staff. The 4 people that were working did an excellent job taking orders and getting food out in a reasonable amount of time - even if they had to run!  As for the food; nothing really stood out, but it was pretty good. I would eat there again just because it's nice to see employees care about their job and their customers!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here before the Suns vs Spurs basketball game.   Pros: Location (its right across the street from the US Airways Center) + full stock bar with wide drink selections = 5 stars  Cons: Service was slow and a little unorganized. We didn't know who our waitress was since we were helped by multiple servers after flagging them down -1 star. Food was your typical greasy bar food. Very forgetful and not worth the price -1 more star.   It's an OK spot if you're in the downtown area for standard bar food but if you are looking for something more, save your money and go elsewhere. There are tons of nearby restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"While there many choices to eat at our hotel,Its better to walk on the strip to venture out,Your on vacation who wants to just stay in the hotel and we wanted to have some drinks.We walked over and was a bit thrown off for a sec because the store front is what you see first but there was a lady who asked if we wanted the resturant which is just upstairs.  I ordered a chicken cobb salad and my husband got  pizza(flatbread) and macaronni as a side as the waitress explained the pizza is small and she was right!Sadly the macaronni was a loss for him.  I will say I ordered the bahama mama and regret not getting the souvenir size which wouldve been a cheaper option.Oh well,all in all love the vibe.Next time we will sit in the patio area."}
{"text":"It's the hard rock!!!! What can you say? Love the place! Great music and great food. Same the world over!!!! I hit a hard rock whatever city I'm in!!! Pin collector and food lover and beer lover! Margaritas in the Phoenix hard rock were very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon, was seated promptly but waited over 40 minutes for our food. The waitress was very apologetic about it and we got our meals for free though. The food was surprisingly really good though.  We got a chicken salad and chicken tenders.  You can`t beat the view!"}
{"text":"Might be a different country, but it is the same old Hard Rock.  The usual food, the usual super happy waitress and the usual \"why did I eat here\", after you leave."}
{"text":"Darn shame they're closing...  I had their shrimp and it had a great coleslaw...there was probably lemon in it...and it was good!"}
{"text":"Some local friends took us to the upstairs room for live music.  We didn't eat here, so I can't comment on the food.  The upstairs is very nice. There are huge windows near the bar, overlooking all the chaos outside.  The bar area is quite nice, although, in true bar fashion, the drinks are too expensive.  It was fairly dead in there (being a Sunday night) and the bartender was pretty cool. I had ordered a Vodka Cranberry, and it was waaay too expensive, but poured with Smirnoff.  Being a bit of a vodka snob, I asked the bartender how much is the different to pour Ketel One or Chopin.  It was $1.50; cool. Next drink I ordered, I'd get it that way.  So I turn to talk to my friends, and a few minutes later, the bartender brings me a new vodka cranberry, with Chopin to replace my original drink and wasn't charging me for the difference.  What a nice guy!  Later in the night he also gave one of the girls in our party a round of shots for us. They were terrible! But they were free =)  The area to watch the band/dance is spacious with a good amount of tables.  The band itself, Sin City Sinners, was good, as always. I have seen them a few times and they're full of energy and awesome hard rock!  As we stumbled down the stairs at the end of the night (be careful!), we stopped at a couple tabletop arcade style games and played for a while.  That was fun too!"}
{"text":"We are here for Yelp Elite Vegas. Normally, my group would probably not stop here to grab a bite to eat as one thing we try to be is adventurous. But as a sponsor to our great gathering, you get our gratitude and our business.  Most will probably not see the same menu that us Yelpers saw at the prices we saw, but I'll be blunt and say it was pretty much happy hour dishes at higher than usual prices. Yes, we are in Vegas, but if you are not going to be a buffet or fancy then you better be cheap.  Oh Hard Rock food, I have a 3 star feeling about you:  -=-Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders-=- Too bready for the meat and flavor content. Pork Belly is so yummy when it leaks it's juices all over your bread. Wasn't the case here.  -=-Braised Short Rib Tacos-=- They weren't stuffed by any means, but I felt were the most tasty of the bunch. The bites into these were the most enjoyable I had for this meal.  -=-Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos-=- These were a crispy surprise, but then again you dip anything in ranch and I'm a fan. Dip my napkin in ranch and I'd probably faint.  -=-Twisted Mac and Cheese-=- We ordered this outside of the Yelp menu. It was all tons of cheesy. For what it was, without meat additives (ignoring the chicken on top, doesn't count), it was a good blend, but was still missing something. Can't put a finger to it.  Oh Michael, so awesome you were as our server. You were 5 star awesome. The Yelp Elites were in town and you delivered. We'll be sure to post of our group photo here. I hope our other Yelp Elites were able to have the pleasure as well."}
{"text":"I love Hard Rock Cafes... Just not this one.  It's dirty and sticky everywhere.  The filthy  front door should be a warning sign.  The staff is friendly but the whole place needs a bath! Some of my food was not even warm. Take a pass as there are many nice places to eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The place was pretty cool, but the food just tasted horrible. Not a fan and would not recommended this place  for people who only get a chance to eat at one or two restaurants while visiting. Try something different."}
{"text":"i like how this place messed up my order but i was too hungover to realize. ended up getting 2 hamburgerz for da price of 1 ;) barely finished the first one so i took the other one, to-go. saw a bum outside so i gave it to him. the end.  drinks was amazing and got a souvenir cup!  great customer service!!! i think they messed up my order on purpose lol"}
{"text":"The food at this, as with most Hard Rock Cafes, is adiquate. The staff is friendly. And the memorabilia is a worthy distraction. What more do you want? As aptly stated in the movie Office Space (1999) -  \"People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, okay? They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attittude.\""}
{"text":"The Hard Rock Cafe is off the main Strip but my girlfriends and I travel there once in awhile for after work drinks. We usually meet the most interesting people there. Sit at the bar and socialize --- you will be surprised who you meet."}
{"text":"I've been to over a dozen Hard Rock Cafes, so there was no question I'd be stopping at their Pittsburgh location on my recent visit for a Pirates' game & stop at the must-see Warhol Museum.  I went during mid afternoon (3:30 or so) & was politely greeted & seated right away.  Visiting a Hard Rock, I generally order the same thing every time on my first visit & they nailed it - the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken.    Some fun mementos from rock & roll history, of course - boots owned by The Edge, a Pittsburgh Steelers' themed guitar, Eddie Van Valen's guitar from a show in the city & tons more.  The service was fast, friendly & efficient & a visit to the Rock Shop after my meal did do a bit of damage to my wallet.  If I return to Pittsburgh, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to over a dozen Hard Rocks around the world, with Cleveland being the latest.  You expect a certain consistency of quality, service & presentation with a restaurant like this & Hard Rock Cleveland delivered on all three counts.  While it was a bit difficult to find as a first time in a while visitor to Cleveland, once we got there, the wait around lunchtime wasn't very long (20 minutes for a party of 3), the service was friendly & fairly quick & the food was actually better than average - I tend to get the same thing on my first visit as something a litmus test (the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken, if it's available).  You're in the city of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  The Hard Rock is steps away from Progressive Field & is an ideal stop before an Indians' game.  If you haven't visited yet, why not?"}
{"text":"Our waitress Noelle was awesome!! Ask for her ! Food so so drinks and atmosphere excellent"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of Hard Rock Cafes, and kind of despise the idea of going from Cafe to Cafe to collect T-shirts that advertise for their business, but this place literally rocks!  First, upon stepping inside, there are about six screens which show Hard Rock Cafes in different cities of the world, live, allowing us to really watch what is happening in each of these venues, thousands of miles away.  I spent a few moments to watch diners in Beijing!  We went for drinks and for lunch, and while we were making our way to the bar/restaurant on the second floor, we spent time admiring outfitsworn by different pop icons which were diplayed in glass cases throughout. We also amused ourselves with the various interactive screens with music videos and interviews.  Once we sat down, we ordered tequila shots and some drinks.  They had the tequila we wanted and I had a really great mojito.  The food is the typical fare of Hard Rock Cafe...bar food, and some salads....I did, however, really enjoy my chicken salad.  Our server was super friendly and told us that they have live music on the third level every night and a DJ one night.  He then brought passes to get in without paying cover.  After that, we scored some rodeo gear from the Coors Girls, as the rodeo was passing though town and a cowboy was signing autographs. After lunch, we went to the balcony to check out the view, which overlooks the strip, across from the Monte Carlo.  Then, we went upstairs to check out the music club, though it was not open yet, as it was lunchtime.  The third level has an impressive circular bar and a full stage that reminds me of the House of Blues.  I cannot wait to go back and check out a show one night."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Hard Rock Cafe in at least 8 years.  I didn't even know they were still around.  One thing is certain, they haven't changed much and that's OK.  The menu is still standard American fare.  The best part is the memorabilia on the walls. Hardly anyone was there when we went for brunch on a Sunday, so we were able to wander around the restaurant and look at the stuff to our heart's content.  My only beef was that they said they served breakfast/brunch but I didn't see any breakfast items on the menu.  Maybe we were too late, but doesn't brunch usually run until 2pm on Sundays?"}
{"text":"the food was good, the service could have been better. we enjoyed the music some things you havent heard on the radio in years, where being played so it was nice. what i didnt like, every few min people would scream- and i mean SCREAM the waiters were egging on a crowd in the back to get loud, and after a long day of walking around the strip and just wanting a good meal- this kind of ruined it."}
{"text":"Walked in and couldn't hear nothing but a very loud band playing on stage. Went to buy pins and couldn't hardly hear my total cost...yes it was very loud. Walked around the corner and seen kids actually on the stage singing and playing instruments, drums guitars etc.... I was totally amazed and into these kids. Come to find out they were attending School of Rock and got to perform here. How cool is that?! Kudos to Hard Rock for letting them be real rock stars....  Clean restrooms, nice staff. Would recommend--"}
{"text":"Love the Hard Rock cafe!!! Love the pins-- I'm an huge collector. Love the guitars hanging from the ceiling. The staff is very welcoming and nice. We didn't eat any food but the rock shop was excellent-- Parking across the street. Easy to get to."}
{"text":"Not a very clean establishment- not very friendly here either. Came in for the pins and had to walk clear across the restaurant area where there was messed all over the floors. It felt as if I was walking through a maze to try to avoid it. No parking- I can see why they are closing this place down very soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Hard Rock today and never, ever again.  It was 11:30 a.m. and not busy when we arrived.  We had deliberately arrived early so we wouldn't have a long wait.   We waited about 15 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order.  Then we waited and waited and waited for a server to take our meal order.  My husband ordered a grilled chicken and ham sandwich which came with bacon and a side order of French fries and he was satisfied with it.  He also ordered coffee - no one ever asked if he wanted a refill until he asked for the check.  I ordered the mushroom burger and the server said I could substitute onion rings which I did.  The burger arrived with French fries and we never saw her again so I could complain. The burger was so greasy that I couldn't eat most of it.  As for my beverage - it was $3.60 for a Sierra Mist and no one asked for a refill.  We will never ever go back to this place.  It is a disaster."}
{"text":"I was excited to see what rock memorabilia they'd have here.  I had the pleasure of dining next to Fred Durst's hat.  Come on.  The food is good standard bar food, this is a good venue to see a band at, but do heed my advice and pre game (then cab!  stay safe!) bc the drinks are a little pricey.  There are better drinking/eating options in St Square.  I didn't hate the Hard Rock, but it's one of those restaurants I wouldn't really go to unless I had a reason to go there, ie friends band playing, friends bday and they REALLY want to go to the Hard Rock, etc."}
{"text":"We held our Family Reunion Dinner at Hard Rock Cafe. We were greeted with exceptional service from our arrival. Our Main Bartender/ Hostesses was Naomi and Kyle, both were great!  Naomi was exceptional the entire time. The food was some of the best ever. We had Chicken, Turkey, Barbecue Pork, Sweet Potatoes, Stuffing/Dressing, Cabbage, Green Beans, Toss Salad, Caesar Salad, Baked Beans, Apple Cobbler, and Chocolate Mousse Pie.  Their 3rd floor is perfect for Corporate Events, Weddings, and Parties.  They even have outside portion, that over looks the Las Vegas Strip.  We had 40 people and we all LOVED it!"}
{"text":"So, this is one in the series of reviews I'm throwing up there during my #transient-week adventure during the first week of July thru Southern Nevada and Arizona. There were several casualties.  Sad to say this place was empty - however, I did come on a Monday but it was a holiday weekend. Came here with some friends to recover from Sunday. Like I mentioned, it was quite dead so the service was pretty quick. We all sat at the bar and sucked our Jameson and Guinness's down in piece. I am however a fan of the pulled pork sandwiches here, but a lot of the other items are so-so and pretty pricey for the portions you get - especially considering the deals you can get in Vegas. You are definitely paying for the name. However, it was fun to go and visit and see the memorabilia. The host was funny as shit jumping around and playing air guitar as he sang the songs out of the top of his lungs."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that I have been to 25+ Hard Rock Cafes and am a bit of a fanatic!  However, this one just didn't quite met my expectations.  I came for a Dave Matthews cover band that was playing outside on a Friday night.  When I came into the cafe, the hostess said the patio was full and that she wouldn't even put me on a waiting list because everyone on the patio was there for the concert and wouldn't be leaving.  After some argument, I finally convinced her to put me on a waiting list and \"magically\" a table opened up about 10 minutes later.  My sister and I wanted to drink Sangria so we figured it would be cost-friendly to get the pitcher.  The pitcher had a ton of ice and wasn't full to the top so we only got 3 glasses out of it and it ended up costing us more than if we would've just bought 3 individual glasses.  I ordered one of the local dishes - the pierogies and kielbasa.  These were overpriced but good, other than the fact that they were sitting in a pool of grease or butter.  I asked for a side of sour cream (which I was surprised didn't automatically come with pierogies) and they tried to charge me $1.80 for it when my bill came.  I wanted to use my rewards card, which they tried to tell me had expired, even though it hadn't.  The atmosphere is great and the concert was very entertaining, but it seems that the staff may be under-trained."}
{"text":"My vote is always to go for a local establishment over a chain restaurant. However, we came here this past Friday evening around 7:30'ish for a friend's farewell dinner. And surprisingly, we did enjoy our food and drinks better than expected.  Since the weather was somewhat windy we opted to stay inside in the separated dinning area since we were in a large group of about 12. Our server was friendly, prompt and very accommodating to our requests.   For such a big establishment, I didn't feel like they had much of a beer selection but what they had was good enough. Since most of the yelpers were raving about the \"Legendary Burger\" - I went with the medium rare (the only way to go IMO)  and my S.O. ordered the shrimp/chicken fajita. A vegetarian in the group ordered the \"Veggie Leggie\" which I was told was not too appetizing. The Legendary burger I ordered tasted great. Juicy with a couple strips of crispy bacon on top. Can't go wrong with bacon... The portions or at least the \"cheese/veg fillings\" and the \"tortilla\" for the fajita was just a bit more than my S.O. could handle.  I believe, the band started playing around 9 and could get pretty loud if you're dinning inside in the main/bar area. Overall, we all had a great time. The food and the service was good. The location is great! And since the three river trail passes through station square - so perhaps, a future pit stop for some food and drinks might just happen this summer."}
{"text":"We usually stay at the Hard Rock Hotel every visit to Vegas (Which is conveniently in the same parking lot as this cafe), and We ALWAYS make our way to this specific Hard Rock Cafe. From the moment you walk in the staff gives you a Rock N Roll Greeting! Staff is ALWAYS attentive, fast, and gives great recommendations.  I try a LOT of burgers in Vegas, and I still agree this place serves some of the BEST BURGERS. Make sure you sign up for the rewards points, and show your yelp coupon!"}
{"text":"I only wend into the store, but there were helpful and quick.  I was in and out within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Cool place, we rented it out for an event and had a blast. The band was good. the staff was helpful and its just so big. Wow lots of room. We had the whole place to ourselfs. The food was  not great. as i gluten allergy and the food being served was not gluten free. they did bring me a plate but had to dig for it."}
{"text":"I had the wings and potato skins. Not very good the wings were cold, and the potatos were not great. This was my 2nd stop here. Both times were so so."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend for dinner with a friend before seeing a show.  The price was as expected, averaging between $15-25.  The service was great.  We were seated right away and our server was funny and helpful.  He kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed and two different managers came by to see that we were satisfied.  The food was delicious.  I was a little upset because I substituted a side for the twisted mac and cheese and was not informed that it was a $5 upcharge.  However, I made a small comment about this and it was immediately resolved with an apology and a comp, no questions asked.  Overall, I would definitely return here if I am looking for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"The Hard Rock Cafe is a great place to visit at least once when you're in Las Vegas!   The decor; from Amy Winehouse's pink dress, MC Hammer's famous \"Hammer Time\" outfit, Frank Sinatra's gold plated microphone, to Madonna's toy encrusted bustier, are just a few of the many memorabilia's to admire @ the cafe! Wherever you are seated, music history will be around you!   We sat in one of the spacious booth seating across from the bar. Musician, Justin Carder had the crowd singing along with him while he performed famous cover songs from different artists. His voice was stunning! The noise level was also perfect which made it even much more enjoyable. There is no need to shout for anyone to hear you. ;)   The modern bar area with talented mixologists, offers a scenic view of the strip with bar seating and lounge area. Patio dining is also available depending on the weather. On this trip, it was bbbbrrrr cold and windy.  Now let's talk food. I've been to several Hard Rock Cafes and have only experienced mediocre tasting dishes from their \"Authentic American Cuisine\" menu. But to each is own. We ordered the Jumbo Bruschetta classic for our appetizer, the Twisted Macaroni and Cheese with grilled chicken and the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich. For a party of 4, it was plenty, but again, average in taste. On the other hand, our waitress Rachelle was outgoing and deserves kudos for her exemplary service!   Overall, leave the gambling aside for a bit. Relax, enjoy the great atmosphere, the history of music and the vibes at the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Louie is excellent server..  Food is good and service is great.. I recommend this location for a good meal and drinks..."}
{"text":"New Years week, was in Vegas and wanted breakfast one day.  My favorite stop was closed (electrical problems), so was trying to find a good, non-buffet breakfast near MGM.  After going to a few places that were swamped, I ended up in Hard Rock.  It was around 10AM and very empty.  Sat at the bar (huge bar, and there was one other couple).  Very surprised at the quality of breakfast.  Had a California omelet with bacon, good service, came out fast, and was much better than expected.    May go back again for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place sucks because they count how much i drink and they told me i had 9 double drinks and i have to go home!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to plenty of Hard Rock Cafe's all over the world AND this was pretty average. Was expecting more.  The food was amazing as always, with generous portions; also had a great laugh with the waiting staff.  It was lacking on the memorabilia front and the general vibe of the place. Not sure what I was hoping for, but it didn't happen. When focusing on the food alone, it's an absolutely winner.  Given the distance from the strip (at least on foot) this is one to miss if you don't have a lifetime to spend in Vegas. Planet Hollywood might be a better shout."}
{"text":"Finally!  This place just announced they will close in July.  Republican conventioneers be warned!"}
{"text":"Dear HRC Security:  When escorting patrons from the premises for \"dancing roughly,\" please do not use them as a battering ram though the crowd of people trying to watch the show. It is not fun having to dodge a person being shoved in your face by a security guard. In fact, while you're at it, get over yourself and let people enjoy a show and dance a little without flipping out that they might bump into someone. This is the \"Hard Rock Cafe,\" not the \"Slow Jazz Cafe.\"   Thanks! Jennifer B.  P.S. Just want to add, the sound quality here is amazing, so it's such a bummer that it's hard to enjoy the show because of outside staff. The actual HRC staff that took our tickets and screened our bags were so incredibly nice."}
{"text":"Last day in Vegas we finally get to do some sightseeing! Decided to have lunch at Hard Rock Cafe and it was pretty yummy and great entertainment! I had the grilled chopped salad and my husband had the legendary burger both yummy to eat!"}
{"text":"My husband and i came in to have a couple of drinks, had an awesome bartender Joey. He gave us awesome customer service and great recommendations on drinks. We decided to stay for dinner. Had the fajitas, which were amazing. Also had the Oreo cheese cake. But what made our night was the great customer service from the staff. Ask for Joey the bartender, you well be in great hands."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this HRC after being seated for 15 mins. I asked a waitress if she could get someone to take my order and all she said was \"uh huh!\" Still nobody. Having just got off a flight, hangry as fuck with a headache and nobody to even bring water or acknowledge me, I walked out. I told the hostess in the front as I walked out that I had been sitting there and nobody came. I write this as I am enjoying my food next door at Joe's Crab Shack where they are taking good care of me. Look at that, service and my food within 10 mins!"}
{"text":"My app was fantastic!  Let me start by saying I sat outside... Servicer was fast and he was nice except.... There was a couple sitting a table over with 2 dogs...my server pet the dogs and continued touching people's dishes and utensils...personally I think he needed to wash his hands prior to touching anything."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my girlfriends here. I chose the grilled chicken bacon club sandwich. Pretty good. Great service. Prices are reasonable. Not much of a wait to be seated on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday around 9pm for a desert. The place wasn't too busy. It was clean. The deserts were unbelievable. Very fresh, beautiful presentation, the portions were huge.  The stuff was very attentive, very polite and professional.  Excellent customer service. Will highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I always love the service there. Very friendly and attentive.   The food is in general good, their burgers though are maybe the best thing they offer. They are a bit messy but quite filling. I personally love the fiesta burger that comes with some guacamole and usually order some sour cream on the side for my french fries.   Their cocktails are pretty good but strangely they don't show you the pries on the menu.  If the weather is nice try to sit outside, it has a beautiful view on the strip!"}
{"text":"Most of the time has very friendly staff and pretty good food. The only downside to this restaurant is that it is a little more on the pricy! I think it is also very cool how they have their own gift shop."}
{"text":"Simple : I ate the best Burger of my U.S trip there. And believe me, I have been to all kinds of burger venues. If you also visit the hard rock hotel this will be your rock museum of the journey !"}
{"text":"So I had the veggie burger. It was not a garden burger that you buy in the frozen aisle of a grocery store. there was a veggie patty, but they added zucchini, yellow squash, and others. They also added salsa, which i did not like. Overall, okay sandwich, okay restaurant, but I would not necessarily come back here."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It's just like most hard rocks with the gift shop and all of the rock and roll memorabilia."}
{"text":"Nice venue! Good view of the strip and good place to come eat and drink! Lost of different events on the third floor."}
{"text":"Our 1st time trying HRC. It was cool inside, gift shop 1st floor, restaurant on second floor. Awesome music the whole time we were there, rock & a few reggae songs. We sat outside, front row seats for the strip. The food was super delish. Try the cauliflower wings! So good. Also our server was really friendly w/ helpful suggestions. Can't think of her name tho, sorry: ("}
{"text":"We came here on a whim because they were offering 20% off with our rock in rio wristbands. We've been to others and this is right up there as probably the best. Walk upstairs and get your picture taken and wait for your table to be prepared. We waited 5 minutes on a Friday afternoon in Vegas! I think that's bad ass.    We had some cocktails which were delicious and we ordered a burger and sampler appetizer. It was so much food we left 25% of it there. So much flavors and options to choose from had us stuffed. Our booth had its own personal TV to watch the music videos that wee synced with the in house music and we thought that was sweet because some of them were live performances. The picture you take at the beginning is not free, 20 bucks for 3 sizes but hey it Vegas right? You get nickel and dimed everywhere so that's not surprising.    We did not buy anything from the gift shop but they have hard rock memorabilia such as t shirts, mugs, sweaters, etc."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe. Welcoming staff. Food was great. Thanks to our waiter, Eric."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my wife. I had the cowboy Ribeye and she had the jalapeño mac & cheese. Food was great the servers were friendly and the music was outstanding."}
{"text":"Took kids here for the first time, food was good, service was good, was a nice time. Both my girls are their entire meal, a hot dog and pasta. They are picky eaters. When they clean their plates, desert is in order. They ordered a brownie sundae, the waitress actually advised is to get 1 because of the size. Most places don't care if there is waste. This made me happy that one cared enough to suggest this. Pulled pork was great, my wife had the fajitas, she really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Hard Rock is a great place to enjoy lunch or dinner, especially when it's nice out and you can eat outside. They also have an indoor patio so you can get views of the city while inside.  On Friday, I had the pleasure of spending the afternoon with my 2 year old niece. For some reason, Hard Rock was my first choice (mostly because I planned on the incline & Mt Washington as well).   The hostess and server were so kind and sweet. They made sure my niece felt like a princess (I believe Jess was our server). We enjoyed dinner outside and loved the views of Pittsburgh. My niece also loved seeing the birds that stopped by for a visit near HRC :)   We shared the chicken club sandwich which comes with fries and it was yummy. The fries weren't too hot (same as my last visit) but hey nothing's perfect. We still enjoyed our meal & my niece enjoyed eating dinner in the big city. Jess even made sure to write a note on our bill to enjoy our afternoon.  *Thanks for a great memory with my shining star, HRC."}
{"text":"My server Kelsea was AMAZING!!! Her service was great! I asked what she recommended for a drink, she gave me her recommendation and she ended up surprising me... I will definitely be back for Kelsea"}
{"text":"Always a great place before a sports event of whatever downtown. We had a great server and the best way is to be a member so you get priority seating.   On a DBack game night we waited 10 minutes maybe. The salmon is excellent and the drinks are to die for. They actually use alcohol. The hurricane was delish...I love hard rock"}
{"text":"We adore this place!  Awesome music!  We don't have to endure that Dance/Hip Hop/RnB crap that's crammed down your throat in SO MANY other places.  It kills my appetite and I can't wait to get out of there.  Here it's rock!  Plain and simple.  Heck, it's in the name!  The food is pricey.  But the food is excellent, the portions are huge, and the staff is courteous, friendly, and attentive.  Of course it's loud.  But that's because of the large crowd that is there majority of the time and the music.  To go with the music is an assortment of music memorabilia all over the place and the gift shop is pretty cool too.  Upstairs is a large area for private events.  I don't know what people are talking about when they dislike the food, since we've never had a bad experience.  If you're too cowardly to send food back that isn't to your liking, then you pretty much have surrendered your right to complain.  How can a restaurant get any better if they don't hear about where they can improve right then and there?  If you like rock (both classic and current), you can handle a noisy environment, and aren't looking for fast food, nor gourmet lah-dee-dah food, I highly recommend the Hard Rock Cafe!"}
{"text":"Awesome Hard Rock compared to most.  Their memorabilia is top notch.  Friendly staff and good drinks."}
{"text":"Poor quality and expensive fast food. When we got the bill we were charged extra to keep the pint glasses even though we didn't want them.  $52 a head for fast food, that is outrageous. $14 a pint and16.95+tax+tip for a veggie burger?"}
{"text":"I work in the same building upstairs. Tower City is pretty empty but this place keeps it together. The hostesses and servers recognize our lunch group & they really take care of us. Make sure we eat & get back to work on time. Food is good. Menu is small and a little pricey but i guess a $9.00 hamburger is the norm downtown."}
{"text":"Eh...not exactly what I was expecting. Unfortunately, we came a half hour too early for lunch so we ended up just getting offered the breakfast menu.  I wasn't in the mood for breakfast... soOOooOoo I didn't order anything, just a water.  My hubby ended up ordering some blueberry pancakes for $14.00 and my daughter had the chicken and waffle for $17.95 YIKES. Yes, just one piece of fried chicken on one waffle. Nothing fancy.  I did take a small bite and it tasted ok. Nothing out of this world. You'd think for that price they would of put a whole fried chicken on 10 waffles. My hubby liked his pancakes. They were big and fluffy, but again.... not worth the price.  I had to remember....It's about the experience. ..right? SoOOoo...we sat outside over looking the Vegas strip. Interesting, may I say the least.  Almost reminded me of being in New Orleans during Mardi gras time.  Yeah...Nope."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I didn't want to ruin our appetites by eating something we weren't familiar with, so we chose another American-based restaurant to eat at while staying in Montreal. We had lunch here, so the place was a little empty at the time. I had twisted mac chicken and cheese, and it was so good that I actually cleaned my plate. My boyfriend ordered a burger and a \"Hpnotiq tea\". Both were good. We will definitely eat here again if we were to return to Montreal."}
{"text":"I don't mind playing the role of tourist every once in a while and heading down to the strip. After visiting M&M World and the World of Coca-cola, my wife, kid, and I stopped by the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch. It's an impressive looking place. Three stories. The first is the store, second is the restaurant, and third is the concert area.  The last time I ate at a Hard Rock Cafe was probably the late '90s (in Cancun). I wasn't impressed back then with the food and I wasn't expecting much this time around either. But, it was actually better than I had hoped.  The wife got a burger that wasn't on the menu. A beef patty topped with a portobello mushroom and haystack onions, along with some other stuff. Also came with a side salad. She liked it and it was enough food for two people.   I got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (topped with caramelized onions, crispy bacon, and cheddar cheese). It was juicy and tasty and the BBQ sauce had a sweet, smokey flavor to it. Not bad at all. I also had a margarita with pomegranate and some other fruity flavors (don't judge me... sure I occasionally drink fruity cocktails. I don't care what others think.) that was pretty good.  Our son got the chicken tenders. Three to an order with a large heap of fries.   Our server was friendly and stopped by often to check on us. But wasn't overly intrusive. He even brought out a complimentary sundae for our kid after he found out it was his birthday.  There's a huge interactive wall just past the hostess stand and there's also a touchscreen at each booth with info about memorabilia, merchandise in their store, and a voting system for the next song that's played in the restaurant. It's a great idea, but the interface is clunky. Anyone who's ever used an iphone or android will probably find it to be a little primitive. Also, there was a huge disconnect between the song that the screen indicated was playing and the music that was piped through the sound system. I don't think it listed the correct song the whole time we were there.  Overall, this is a place that will attract only tourists looking for a relatively cheap, predictable meal (at least for the second floor dining area). The food was 3-star worthy, but I'm tossing in an extra star because of the good service."}
{"text":"It's the typical Hard Rock Cafe. Not too much of a gift shop. Food was good. I'm not a fan of going to Hard Rock Cafes myself but my kids wanted to go. I like going to local places that I can't go to when I'm home.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and fries. The drink prices were a little high I thought."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?! I used to go here when I was younger and remember it differently.  I got the \"Goat Cheese Chicken Salad Sandwich\". It had no flavor. The sandwich was too small for $13.50. It said on the menu it came with a side salad and fries but the server said I could only pick one or the other and I had to pay $2.25 for it I mean what the heck is up with that?. I chose the \"Smothered Fries\" which had bacon and cheese on them. They were OK.  My man had the \"10oz Burger\" and he said the burger didn't have much flavor as well. The cost for that was $$15.75 and they charged $3.75 for a side on \"Onion Rings\" with it. Way too much money.  We decided to split a dessert and got the \"Mini Peanut Butter Pie\" and that cost $4.25. I have to say this was the best part of the meal.  One perk is that if you have a Nevada ID you get 15% off your bill which is cool but when the food isn't so tasty that doesn't seem like much of a perk."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here. No wait at front. Seated us right outside on balcony. Staff was nice and friendly. Got out food very quick. Was nice and hot. Price was great. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Worth it if you have guests in from out of town. the atmosphere and decor is impressive. Lots of music memorabilia. Seating can be a bit tight."}
{"text":"Very good but cold when i received my food..."}
{"text":"Attempted to grab a bite tonight during the film festival .Sat at a bar table for 10 minutes and no one could be bothered to wait on me. Guess I can't rate the food or drink then."}
{"text":"Good food. I highly suggest the jumbo combo for your appetizer. The grilled chicken was amazing, really good charred taste.   The general manager Greg brought us shots to our table which was really, it shows he cares and his customers. Our server Joy was also awesome as well, she took really good care of us. If you want good food and good customer service I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!!! The food is good!  The CAESAR SALAD was good and the oven baked croutons melts in your mouth. Good amount of shaved parmesan cheese. :)  The wings were delicious. The steak was nice and tender.   Plenty of music memorabilia throughout the cafe especially on the 3rd level. Take the time to go see it."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The servers here were kind of over the top good. At first I thought it was a bit weird but after I had my roadie (its a drink) i eased up and just enjoyed the atmosphere. They have televisions pretty much everywhere playing some of the classics. Ozzy, Prince (before the symbol), the yeah yeah yeah's, and lots of others. Besides the cool entertainment all the rock memorabilia makes this an interesting lunch choice.   We ordered the giant combo platter (not the actual name). It was really huge and cooked to perfection. The onion rings were super crunchy and the wings had a nice spice to them. At first i thought the combo was a little over priced, but the portion sizes definitely give you your money's worth."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, the music is so loud and it's the worst music in the world. One song was literally 3 people on LSD screaming in a microphone. It's unreal, every song sounds exactly the same yet slightly worst than the last one. This has to be what they play at Guantanamo Bay to torture terrorists. They are playing fast and loose with the term \"Rock\"."}
{"text":"We started with the giant appetizer platter and it was worth the money. I got a caesar salad and my husband got a pulled pork sandwich which was gross. The waiter took it off the bill and he got a honey mustard chicken sandwich which was fantastic. The entire staff was very friendly and has a very mom and pop locally owned feel."}
{"text":"So we came in for lunch, maybe a drink or two also. I've been to this location a couple of times over the past few years and never did I see it as dead as I did yesterday. Out of the ENTIRE restaurant, two tables had customers, it was a bit lonely in there and a complete dichotomy from the times I've visited in the past.   We ordered our beverages and took a look at the menu. $18, for a hamburger? $16 for a holiday drink? Something isn't right about that... I've eaten here before and had the burgers, they are good but c'mon! I was recently at the Hard Rock in Pittsburgh and the prices were FAR more reasonable. We ended up ordering one root beer ($3.99 + tax & tip- but oh, not one refill was given..) And one domestic beer in a bottle. We decided to leave it at that and ended up eating down the street at P.F Cheng's (which was fabulous, by the way).  Perhaps the drastically overpriced menu has gnawed at the customer base that kept it thriving for years.  Maybe it's time for Hard Rock Las Vegas to take a look in the mirror, realize why customers aren't coming in, and do something about it while they still can. And stop playing horrible 80's songs and rap! Its Hard ROCK!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends on a Friday night before heading out to a local club in Station Square. We were seated much quicker than I thought that we would be and like Bernadette D. said, the music is kept to a good level where you can actually talk to the people at your table.  The food was pretty good.  Of course, the price was a little bit higher than if you went to an ordinary restaurant in a residential area, but you have to expect to pay a little bit more if you are going to the Hard Rock.  The mixed drink that I ordered was very good and the wait service for drinks was quick.  Also, we didn't wait a long time for our food, despite the busy-ness of the restaurant.  Overall, it was a good experience. I'd go back."}
{"text":"we're from california. vacationing in niagara falls. trekked up to toronto to order a shooter and collect a shot glass.  stella, the bartender was terrific. made a suggestion for my shooter, and it was pretty good. she offered to take a photo of hubby and me, think she's the only one who's every done that out of close to 20 HRCs we've been to.   the cafe is ho hum. no HARD ROCK CAFE on the wall, no HRC-Toronto anywhere at all. there was no music videos on the monitors. music in the air but just HRC ads on the monitors.   very much a let-down. very anti-climatic after that long drive in heavy traffic both ways."}
{"text":"My husband and I were quite disappointed with our lunch here yesterday.  When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by a very friendly and welcoming hostess but after that things seemed to go down hill once we had our server.  After looking at the menu I decided to get the grilled chicken salad that had feta, dried cranberries, \"grilled chicken\" and oranges in it.  My husband had the bbq burger which was recommended by the waiter as being the one everyone got.  After waiting almost an hour for our food and seeing everyone around us receive their food the waiter came over to tell us that he had dropped my husbands burger and that they had to remake the burger but mind you he still did not have the food with him.  The waiter proceeded to tell us how sorry he was but that he wanted to be honest with us and not blame the kitchen .  He then continued to tell us some more about his personal situation and apologize some more to the point where it became awkward since we still didn't have our food and what he was saying about his personal life.  Finally our food arrived and neither of us were completely happy with our meals.  After waiting so long and then being told my husbands meal was dropped on the ground we expected the manager could have stopped by.  My husbands burger was a lot smaller than the ones we saw brought to the tables around us and I wasn't thrilled with the grilled chicken on my salad that looked like deli meat.  I mentioned to the waiter that I thought it was supposed to be grilled chicken and the waiter immediately told me he promised me it wasn't deli meat but that it was supposed to make it easier to cut.  Needless to say after this experience we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The worst Salmon I've ever had. The service was garbage. The restaurant was dirty and again... the worst Salmon I've ever had. I've been to my share of Hard Rock Cafe's so, for food, service, cleanliness.. I'll have to give two thumbs down in a 360 rotation."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Sitting outside with the live music was wonderful for lunch. It's also in the center of the strip so it gives you easy access to wherever you want to go next. Our server was amazing! I would definitely recommend stopping by and grabbing a quick bite here."}
{"text":"While in Vegas we went to the Hard Rock Cafe to have lunch. The menu is quick and simple and has a few new items on it. Walls are full of items from musical groups and other items. The food was excellent and would recommend this venue for anytime to eat they also have a small store for shirts and other items."}
{"text":"We had the breakfast here and it was incredible. My wife had the eggs benedict and I had the fried eggs with potatoes. Both were cooked perfectly. The waitress was awesome also, great service. We didn't even know that the Hard Rock Cafe served breakfast. Glad we happened to stop in ask."}
{"text":"Believe it or not I have never been to a Hard Rock Cafe before! My husband & our friends stopped for dinner on July 4th while on vacation in Vegas. We had a fantastic time! Our waiter (We believe his name was Toad) and all staff we encountered were so friendly, funny and were really wonderful. Our food was delicious, the drinks were fantastic and overall we really had a fantastic time! Our table requested videos to be played and we all enjoyed chatting with Toad and talking music :) thanks for a great 1st experience at Hard Rock!"}
{"text":"So, we were hungry after visiting the Heard Museum, and I had just found out I had $50 on my All Access card from the ridiculous amount of money we spend at the Honolulu Hard Rock a year and a half ago, so we decided to go.  It was a Sunday and downtown Phoenix was dead....as was the Hard Rock Cafe.  It just felt kind of depressing.  Service was a bit slow, my Margarita was blue and the food was so-so.  Then I found out the $50 on my card could not be used towards alcohol....which made up over 50% of our bill.  Oh well.  Had a lot more fun and the Honolulu one, but that's probably because we were on vacation.  :)"}
{"text":"Pretty average. Would equate it to a Chili's or Red Robin. Service was 5 stars. And the local music they had going was 5 stars too. Drinks were a little steep... food was good, just not very unique."}
{"text":"Great service, accommodating kitchen (since I always have to change my order) all wrapped in a rock sound. 2nd time here, still like it! Rock on!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the yummy goodness of this place. Came here on a mellow Thursday night after CES (Consumer Electronics Show) and ordered a pitcher of the sangria, as our waiter had suggested for my girlfriend and I. We did red wine sangria, it was refreshing and delish! For entrees I ordered the Pulled Chicken BBQ Sandwich and it was SO good. I ate every bite, as well as the french fries. I hadn't been here in such a long time, it was a nice chill place to have a drink, good food, and unwind. Totally coming back here when I visit Vegas again, one of my go - tos off the strip."}
{"text":"The brunch here was great. I ordered the eggs benedict which came with side of fruits and baked potato bites and they were all really delicious. I also got the bottomless mimosa which is $15 and although I wish they made it stronger, it was still very good and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for a few quick drinks on our last day in Vegas and had the BEST bartender, his name was Drew!! He was super funny, very quick in his service and provided us with great conversation. We're from the Dallas area and we quickly discovered he was from Waco which only added to the conversation. I really hope Drew gets the credit he deserves for his incredible service. He alone would bring our business back. Great job Drew!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at the bar out front of the HRC on the strip to catch the end of the football playoff game a couple Sundays ago. Jeffery was bartending and he quickly grabbed us a couple of Bud Lights ($15.16 total). We enjoyed the game, though, the TVs there are pretty small and there's not a lot of seating.   Service was terrific and it was a great ending to a good game!"}
{"text":"Went for the show (February State) and was glad I came early for the food. The place is very small for a band venue but we were able to get one of the last two tables. We had a great view of the band. Our chicken club sandwiches came with fries. Very good fries and the sandwich was large well cooked and seasoned. I would have it again! Word of caution, order it on softer bread. The toasted bread it comes on really tore up the roof of our mouths! The dessert shots (Creme brûlée and chocolate mousse) were delicious but very rich. Our waitress came often and was a great personality. I believe her name is Shirley. If you go and take a table for three hours tip well!"}
{"text":"Asked the owner if they could put sports on 1 of the TV's instead of the music videos. It was just after the Phoenix Suns game.  He said no.   It's plain to see why there were only about 10 or 15 people in the whole restaurant.   After 16,000 attended the game right across the street from the restaurant.   The bartender said it's not a sports bar  Doesn't have to be.  But why then is it across the street from the Phoenix Suns in the Arizona Diamondbacks arenas?  Putting one or two TVs out of the 10 or 12 they have in the place on a sports channel, I don't think it's too much to ask.   apparently he did.  Nothing like catering to your customers.   Won't go back."}
{"text":"There's only one reason to go to a HRC - the decor.  There is no reason to go to the PHX HRC.  We stopped by during All-Star game festivities to grab a drink and check out the memorabilia.  The service at the bar was meh, but the place was packed. I didn't have the food but one can assume that its like all HRC - a little better than Applebees at twice the price.    I was once at a HRC (Memphis?  Vegas?  Can't remember) where they had John Lennon's original hand written lyrics to Help!  I sat and stared for a good five minutes, contemplating the history of the thing, and what could have struck him to write those words down in that order.  I didn't mind my overpriced drink that visit.  Unfortunately I walked around the PHX HRC and thought 'They bothered to hang that up?'.  This location could use some Help! in more ways than one."}
{"text":"I have been to many HRCs across the nation, this one seems desolate as far as location goes. Its in Tower City, seems to be a lot of construction in this area and this may account for why it was not very busy, not a whole lot in the area.  Inside is the same food you expect, TVs playing music and videos, good service too. Not so much as many music relics and memorabilia as I have seen in other HRCs. Here seems to be mostly pictures and posters. Considering this is where Rock was born and home to the Rock and Roll museum, I would expect a lot more cool stuff here."}
{"text":"I ordered the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken Sandwich. The chicken was rubbery and couldn't even be shredded apart when I tried to bend it. I suspect that the chicken was boiled first and then flipped around the grill for some char marks.   The good news is that the waitress did not charge me for the sandwich.  I won't be back. The food for the rest of my table was generally okay, but the prices are too high for only okay."}
{"text":"One a year my business team & I have a dinner at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe.  We keep going back because the food is great, & the device is fantastic.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"After being let down by Karim and his cobbler deli..My friend and I walked to Hard Rock Cafe. Service was prompt and friendly..how could it not be.. there were only 4 tables occupied. The whole reason we ventured out was for cobbler (see review on Karim's Cobbler Shop & deli for debacle)and lo and behold Hard Rock was offering Apple Cobbler. The day was not wasted. I opted for the spicy chicken mac 'n cheese and I was not disappointed.. it had a kick to it. It is rare to experience true flavor at a chain so I was extremely pleased. They could have thrown in a bit more chicken but in their defense I did order the side not the meal. But the side was plenty filling. Onto dessert. oooh the fabulous cobbler crunchies....imagine me squeal with delight. Apple wouldnt  have been my first choice but it was damn good. Revenge is mine Karim! Thank you Hard Rock for saving the day."}
{"text":"Speaking as a vegetarian.  I felt that they didn't have enough options for me.  I was limited to like 3 items.  Boring!  It is a super spacious restaurant.  We sat close to the window, great view.  Our waiter always had this smile going on.  I knew it was fake, but it made me smile every time he came by our table.  Contagious.  There are a few celebrity props encased behind glass.  My guess that is the perk of all Hard Rock Cafes?  So I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here as a vegetarian, sorry Hard Rock.  You need to learn from The Yard House, bring in more veggie items."}
{"text":"Resto sympa quand on veut manger américain  avec des quantités énormes qui justifient le prix. La musique et le fond sonore élevé qui peuvent parfois être dérangeant. Les plats sont bons et le service efficace. La vue sur le strip est sympa."}
{"text":"While staying at the hotel we decided to eat at the off strip location for the cafe. HRC has been a favorite of my family for years. This location did not disappoint, in fact it exceeded my expectations. Our server, who was also the bartender, was extremely efficient and attentive and didnt even blink when we asked for like 18 different sauces. The local burger here, called \"the hangover\" is so delicious with a fried egg on top of it, I would go back just for that. To make everything even better, she realized we were locals when she checked our id and gave us a locals discount. I would definitely come back here for that burger and the service."}
{"text":"Staff is really on point here. We stopped in for drinks and appetizers before the baseball game. Our appetizer took a really long time to come out, to where it was close to game time. The manager noticed how long it took and automatically took care of it for us. It was nice that the issue was recognized without us having to say something. We were a lil late to the game, but with the service we received we will definitely come here again for pre game drinks and food."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of HRC or Planet Hollywood as these places are usually packed, along with long lines and their food are way overpriced.  However, my friends and I were hungry.  We wanted to eat somewhere close to the Rogers Centre, where we would watch a Blue Jays game afterwards.  We were surprised that there weren't any restaurants near the stadium.  A security guard told us about HRC in the stadium.  Tired, hungry and wet from the rain, we went to HRC.  Of course, there was a LONG LINE of teenagers waiting to be seated.  Oh great!  Anyways, I went in and put in a reservation for my party.  The host told me it would be 20 minutes.  I thought, yeah right!  Well, to our surprise, we waited less than 20 minutes.  And, we were seated right by the window, overlooking the baseball field.  We could see the Blue Jays practicing.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Food was good! It couldn't have been better.  The inflated prices of our meals were worth it!"}
{"text":"I really like the Hard Rock Cafe... other than the fact they killed my friend (he has a wicked allergy to cheese... he did recover, but his heart did stop in the ambulance on Public Square)   The changes they have made to he menu and food quality have been a major plus, and I am hooked on the burgers, and their twisted mac and cheese. It's a chain, but it's still very solid for a downtown meal"}
{"text":"This cafe Is one cool spot!! It has an outside patio with great views of the strip, friendly staff, good drinks, and a hip atmosphere. Great place to bring a group of friends."}
{"text":"I had the fajitas. The shrimp were large, that was good.  But the food was really bland; it was like they didn't put any spices on it. Where I come from, fajitas are brought to the table practically on fire, steaming and sizzling.  Here they were lukewarm.  The cooked vegetables were also lukewarm and just limp, not really grilled.  I was pretty disappointed in this meal."}
{"text":"When my wife and I went here, I wore a KISS tee shirt, not knowing what would happen AS WE WERE LEAVING !  We sat on the second floor patio, if it wasn't for the tv screens showing music videos you would not know it was the Hard Rock. But hey, the food was fine, it was exactly what I would expect at a Hard Rock Cafe. Although the serving size of side dishes left a lot to be desired. Look at my pictures and you'll see.  To eat my wife had a barbecue combo. She loved the juicy-ness of her meal.  I enjoyed \"The Texan... Chipotle and hickory bar-b-que sauce, cheddar cheese, crispy jalapenos and crispy onions... everything is bigger in texas! go big & make it a 10oz. bar-b-que sandwich for an additional charge\" Yeah I made it the 10oz.  Yes I copied those descriptions from the menu.  Las Vegas Boulevard is famous for people dressing up like celebrities, Elvis, Hello Kitty, and various super heroes are very popular. Take a picture with them if you want, but these people usually ask for a cash tip .  As my wife and I exited The Hard Rock Cafe, I immediately noticed that four people were dressed like members of the rock band KISS. Ace Frehley immediately noticed my tee shirt and pointed at it.  My wife and I continued to walk down the sidewalk. 3 or 4 times people pointed at my shirt and advised me that \"KISS\" was \"just over there.\"  Las Vegas... never boring."}
{"text":"Good food & server! A bit steep but it is a touristy location. Solid music selection! :)"}
{"text":"There's an Autograph wall in the bar at this particular Hard Rock Cafe. For some reason, the only band I remember seeing was Sugar Ray. Wow. Go Phoenix! Way to bring in the big boys!  Really though, it's a typical Hard Rock. The beer selection was fine, the tables were sturdy, and all the Rock n Roll memorabilia hanging from the walls were able to bring in the post-game crowd. It also shielded us from the crazy summer storm that was building up outside. Hallelujah."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan.  The food and drinks are overpriced for what you get.  That's my big issue.  There are so many better places to go in walking distance.  The service is fine, but everything else is just not work the money.  That is unless you want to pay $10 for six wings or $15 for a mediocre burger."}
{"text":"The food here is so good, breakfast and lunch! We come to this place every time we are in Vegas. It's a little pricey but it's right on the strip (great views from the patio). The servers are fun and friendly. They are great, even when they're super busy. We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Hoo hoo. Turkey Burgers and Guitars!  Place is great for grub and for looking and cool music things on the wall.  My turkey burger was not the best, but it hit the spot!  Try Pink Taco's inside the casino. You will have more fun and see more bikinis!"}
{"text":"I took a few of my friends here during our trip to Vegas, and the food is absolutely delicious! However, the service was terrible.  My friend got two glasses of water spilled on her by our waiter, James I believe, and he acted like it wasn't that big of a deal, which I thought was rather rude. He was patronizing and it was hard to get his attention.  One of my other friends ordered a mojito and decided it wasn't quite what she wanted. She asked the same waiter if it was possible to switch the drink and he replied 'It's alcohol. Just drink it.\" When she tried to explain that she didn't want to spend her money on something that didn't taste good and wanted to try something else, he then replied \"Why? So you can just tell me that the new drink isn't what you wanted either?\" She then told him never mind and he left without another word. The service when I went was absolutely atrocious and I do not think that I will be dining at this location ever again."}
{"text":"Walked in for breakfast.  Great customer service.  Food was ok,  came out a bit cold though.  Coffee was good,  we had eggs Benedict,  ricotta pancakes.  The environment was cool,  nice music,  calm atmosphere.  We were going to go to Dennys a block away but that was a madhouse.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"my second fave hard rock of all of the hard rocks i've been to. nice set up. great for groups and social outings. not kid friendly"}
{"text":"Our server \"bunny\" was the rudest server I have had in my entire life. Anytime I would talk she cut me off and would not let me finish my sentences. Was trying to explain I wanted a burger with Just cheese and she told me that was not an option I had to get a burger with everything on it. I would never in a million years go back to this place. I wanted to leave as soon as she started talking."}
{"text":"Where other Themed restaurants fail, The Hard Rock Cafe keeps doing it right. The food is great, the atmosphere is unique (its just like all the other HRCs) but his particular visit was more about the service than the food or atmosphere.   It has been awhile since I have eaten at a Hard Rock and I have never eaten at this one on the strip.   This particular visit was in June 2014.  The day was hot my friends...110+ but since I had just endured one of the coldest winters up in Canada (Temps of -50) I opted to sit on the patio...it was a good idea at first, but after about twenty minutes I was hurting and the water service was lacking.  That is the only reason for 3 stars, but it's Vegas for crying outloud and it should be just common sense to keep checking on the water even though I was drinking beers at the same time...I ended up only getting one water in all that time.   The waitress who took my order was great at taking the original orders, but the follow through was lack luster. She brought me the original beer and water that I asked for, but then I never saw her again...not even to receive the bill.   After waiting and waiting...(there were other patrons on the patio, but I seemed to be in the twilight zone) I had to go to the bathroom. So I went. When I came back, the big guy at the door was looking at me a little sternly and then the waitress came up to me...shes like, \"Oh there you are, we thought you took off\". I was like WTF, why would they say that...you don't come to the table to check on my food, refill my water or beer and then you act like I am a dasher!   Needless to say the tip was about as stellar as the service. When I left I gave the guy a return glare. I should have talked to the manager, but I was honestly too perturbed to deal with excuses.   TIP: If you want patrons to pay the bill, give them the bill, don't treat them like thieves when they go to the bathroom if you haven't given them a bill yet.   It's Vegas, and I like the food there, which was great (Burger) but there are a lot of other places to go where they may treat you a little better. Once I paid the waitress said, \"I didn't think you would just take off\" to which I wanted to reply \"I didn't think you would be such a shitty waitress\" but I didn't because...well, I didn't think of it at the time :)  Cheers"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast. Because we choose to sit on the inside, we were seated immediately.   Our server was so very nice and attentive. After we placed our order it took a while for our food to come out. When our food arrived, mine was incorrect but the problem was solved immediately.   Hubbs ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the burger plate with breakfast potatoes. It would've been nice if our server told us that adding mushrooms and onions was an additional $3 each...really?   Overall our bill was $45, aside from food I ordered soda water and Hubbs ordered orange juice.  This place was pretty expensive for breakfast, but at least the food was good. We only ate here because the wait at Denny's was ridiculously long. This was cool to try for the first time but definitely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! The service was amazing and the food was even better!  The staff was very attentive and nice.  There is a lot of cool stuff on the walls to look at while you wait for your food, and many tv 's to watch. The gift shop is a tad pricey but the items are nice. I was pleasantly surprised with a 20% off check in offer. I will be back here when I make a return visit to vegas."}
{"text":"Located right beside Yonge and Dundas square, the Hard Rock Café is a restaurant you cannot miss. My girlfriend and I felt like going to the hard rock and loved it. It fills up quick, so expect to wait about 15-20 minutes minimum without a reservation.  There are TVs everywhere for your entertainment and a bunch of rock memorabilia! There are constant music videos on screen and music playing in the restaurant (a little noiser than I'd like it to be) so expect to talk a little louder than usual.  I had a burger and it tasted amazing, way better than I expected and my girlfriend had a steak. I tried her steak and it was cooked perfectly. Service wasn't that great though, the server barely checked on us and didn't bother to refill my drink.  Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend on a Sunday night while walking around the area and watching the ice skating. It wasn't crowded and our server showed up immediately. I ordered the colossal mushroom burger with onion rings. That thing was HUGE. I cut it in half and managed to stuff my face. It was delicious, but way more meat than this tummy can hold."}
{"text":"This review is for a private party we had there on the 3rd floor, not the general restaurant.  We hosted our company holiday party there this past week and the space is absolutely incredible.  sofa seating, a patio overlooking the strip, and a super helpful and knowledgeable wait staff.    The food was good enough given there were 160+ of us.  As far as a private place to host an event, this was top notch."}
{"text":"The server was fun and friendly. Atmosphere was great with mellow live music for a morning. I had the chicken and waffles with a maple syrup reduction. This was truly the best fried chicken breast i have ever had."}
{"text":"Veggie garden burger, fries and pina colada. Good music in the background. Feels like a holiday!"}
{"text":"Is it wrong for me to expect good food and good service even from an extremely busy and popular place?  First we tried to call ahead for a very large party - 15 of us for a birthday celebration  and Hard Rock is where she wanted to go - they were rude on the phone, not helpful and they don't take phone ahead reservation for a large group.  Our wait time was over  2 hours because of our large group!  Crazy!  Once we arrived the hostess staff continued on with the unfriendly theme.  Our waitress was friendly enough, but lacked in good service and the food all the way around for everyone was mediocre at best.  I kept my mouth shut while there since it was my cousin choice for her birthday celebration, but not on here :)  Shouting out that I'd rather go through a drive through than eat there again and that means it's really bad because I don't do drive throughs.  Scratching my head why it's so popular!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Aria on a family trip to Las Vegas. I took my parents here for our last dinner. I think it was the best meal that we got our money while on The Strip.  Pros -Our waitress was a superstar. She was ridiculously friendly and positive, even with my gloomy Asian father. She came to check up on us at least every 10 minutes, and never let our glasses get half empty. I don't give a lot of 20% tips, but I didn't need to think twice about this one. -Entertainment at the table! We were seated at a booth, and attached to the wall was a touch-screen that let you could flip through musical memorabilia and look at anything from Britney Spears' waitress getup in her Crazy video to the local newspaper after Lennon's death. -The music, of course! I feel pretty odd commenting on this obvious aspect, but the music was loud enough for me and not too loud for my parents. -$4 for my Groupie Grind! Recommended to me by my waitress. Pina colada mix with mango and strawberry puree. MMMMmmmmm...Oh, for some odd reason there were no prices on the drink menu. I was surprised when I saw the check that my fabulous slushie was just $4 and my mom's fountain drink (I think she got Sierra Mist) was something like $3.50. Moral of the story: Treat yourself to a special drink! -Beer battered Fish n Chips. I don't even like fish, but it was so darn crispy that we all stole some of mom's food.  Just OK: -Cobb salad. A typical and ordinary Cobb salad. Enough to fill me up, but didn't leave me feeling overstuffed. IMO, a good dish if you're not famished and you want to leave a little room to try other foods. I was also eyeing the Anti-Cobb, so maybe I'll try that next time.  Cons: -They make you take a picture with a drum set and guitars when you come in. Fun if you're going with friends, awkward when you're there with your already uncomfortable Asian parents.  Overall: Great service, great atmosphere, good prices and generous portions. If you're stuck on The Strip, this is one of your better options for food."}
{"text":"Okay Quick Tip!!!  If you're going to watch a concert at the Hard Rock Cafe, it would be better to buy your ticket here because they don't charge for service fee and you save about $20!!!  Also, depending on who's playing if you were to buy the ticket on the day of the concert and they still have a lot available, the price gets discounted (supply and demand)!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Hard Rock Cafe in eons, but I was craving a veggie burger. Hard Rock makes good veggie burgers.  I sat at the bar and the waitress was super-personable. I give it an A-OK because it was as expected; nothing better, nothing worse. It was just standard issue chain restaurant fare.  There were a few local foods on the menu including pierogies. I did not try them as I imagine there are much better places to eat them in Pittsburgh than at a Hard Rock, but I liked that they included a shout out to the local culture."}
{"text":"Arugula salad was good but had a little bit too much dressing. Legendary burger was not very memorable. Average american junk food spot. The patio area is nice and shaded and you can people watch from certain seats. Staff was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I love Hard Rock Cafe when I'm visiting Las Vegas. I enjoy their chicken and waffles for breakfast. The all you can drink mimosas are a perfect way to start the day on the strip. The wait staff usually will serve them one after another which makes me feel like I am getting a good value. The inside had cool music memorabilia and the outside has a great strip view."}
{"text":"Loud, bright, crazy, expensive. It's exactly as it should be.  It's about the atmosphere, and they deliver. Our group had a great time. The bartender made great drink selections and we had some great appetizers.  Never really had dinner, kind of forgot after the apps cane out."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. Everyone who works here seems like they love their job too and that is awesome!! The food tastes amazing and i just love eating and just coming here to chill"}
{"text":"The only reason these ratings are high is because it's mostly tourists that have never been to a really good place in Vegas. I've gone here twice now and I can only say that everything is mediocre at best. I went in when there was a show going on I asked the host if we could have a table for 6 and rudely she asked \"are you ordering food?\" As if she had to treat every person there like a vulture just wanting to mooch a table. The service took forever, prices are ridiculous, and the food kinda sucks. I would've ordered dessert but our server too so long I lost my appetite. My advice, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I came here for a show.  The 10 year reunion of Finch's album \"What it is to burn\"  The Hard Rock gets 5 stars for hosting this show.  But really, if I could Yelp rate Finch I would give them the five.  Love this band, this show really took me back.  Sound was great!  Two days later and the hearing in my left ear is still not quite right.  The venue was small, not even a 1000 at capacity.  There were several hundred here for the show.  Good for getting up close."}
{"text":"Our hotel had a little guide to Vegas on the nightstand and as I scoured it for free and/or interesting things to do, the Interactive Rock Wall caught my eye as something my musician husband would enjoy. While it's impressive in theory, the more interesting and fun techie toy we found was just in the waiting area. It was a table top touch screen, reminiscent of the old pac-man tables often found in restaurants during the 80s/90s, but WAY MORE AWESOME... er, well, those were pretty sweet too.   I'm drifting...  So the interactive rock wall has random images of memorabilia floating around which you can drag and touch click and enlarge... and is quite large, with basically 6 docking stations for 6 users to peruse the floating options. However, the table top touch screens had a search feature so you could choose whose junk you got to look at. We immediately searched for the Boss's items in the collection, enjoying the i-whatever type technology that allowed us to pinch and spread our fingers on the screen to zoom in and out and read old setlists and the like.   Fun times for music geeks.  I believe these are the same kinds of screens we saw in the booths, but our table didn't have one to play with... so if you want to enjoy that part of the place, ask specifically to sit near one!   Oh yeah and as far as the food went, it was fine, just as at all Hard Rocks, although I give extra props to the waitress who noticed me order my veggie burger without cheese and asked if I was vegan.  **Side note, vegans, don't plan to eat here. There's really nothing for you. That veggie burger had cheese in it, and I was so grateful that she let me know!!! The option for a side salad is there, but it won't really fill you... with food or nutrients since it was all iceberg or other light-colored lettuces with practically no vitamins."}
{"text":"Amazing Services the staff even more Amazing ! Will love to come her again ! We had a miss under standing in our order and the Manger Jason Handel it really well !"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Sitting at the bar everyone is soooo nice! Laylony is super sweet and wears pigtails just like me!!! Yay!!! I've been here a few times and this is my second review. I'll keep coming back as long as the service is outstanding and the food is yummy!!!   Usually I get the awesome legendary burger. Today I'm trying the potato skins and pulled pork. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in to Hard Rock to have dinner and a few beers tonight. We walked into the bar area and sat at a table with 2 chairs. We waited about 7 minutes and nobody came to wait on us or bothered to acknowledge our existence.  I finally walked up to the bar and when the bartender asked if he could help me, I said yes. I asked him if I could get a couple of menus and also have someone please head over and take our order. He said he would be right over.  About 5 minutes later, he came by and said he would be helping us and then said to look over the menu and he would be back. He quickly turned around and walked away. He never asked if he could start us off on something to drink. He just left.  Alright...anyway we looked over the menu and about 5 minutes later I looked around for him and he was behind the bar chatting with a few people. He was clearly not interested in helping us. Another few minutes went by and I said to my wife that we should leave.  We ended up leaving and on our way out I let the greeter know we were leaving because nobody bothered to help us. He shrugged his shoulders and didn't say a word.  Totally unprofessional on the greeter and a lack of customer service by the staff. I am sure glad the Tilted Kilt was nearby."}
{"text":"Very poor service from the main entrance to the waiter.  Dragged his feet all over forgetting requests and laughing at mistakes.   Had no napkins for a good while and than main course arrived but had no fork or knife.  Workers were sluggish and it was only 4pm.  We wanted to avoid late rush but got hit with mid day slugs. Food had ugly presentation and lost appetite as I didn't get memo this was just a place to drink and not eat."}
{"text":"A bit pricey since it cost 3 of us $75, my daughter didn't like her chicken tenders or fries, I tried them and tenders were not good. My burgers and fries were great though. My husband overall liked his ribs and chicken but wasn't a fan of the sauce and thought the chicken was supposed to have a dry run not sauce."}
{"text":"Kind of bland food. Hard veggie burger. Again, bland."}
{"text":"Had the nachopalooza with brisket, large portion but bland taste. Service was the worst part. Waitress never checked on us after bring served. Never again."}
{"text":"There might exist a need to separate reviews now, being that the venue has its own name and therefore listing, and there was already reason for an update in any case.   For those of you wondering, you can execute a review for the venue (Hard Rock Live as of 2013) for itself here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hard-rock-live-las-vegas.   The Hard Rock Cafe comprises three levels directly across from Monte Carlo's Diablo's Cantina on the strip. First floor is a merch store and box office (for HRL); second floor is the restaurant/bar; and, the third floor is a venue/bar known now as Hard Rock Live. There is memorabilia on all three floors.   This review will strictly be for the restaurant -- being that I have never purchased any merch -- and, the venue has its own listing where one can leave a rating (mine: 3 ). So here goes ...  Food is just alright; and the view is nice if you get seated with one. I have had salads (monstrous in size); burgers (usually cooked to the incorrect specified temperature [charred like a motherfucker]); and, fries (just fries: nothing special). In fact, the entire restaurant can be summed up to just that: Nothing Special.   Pro Tip: there is usually a coupon for money off of one's cheque in those Vegas2Go magazines found all around the strip corridor. They are small (brochure-sized) and red and white. - E"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio overlooking the Strip, fun to people watch, listen to awesome music and have great American food.  Love Hard Rock burgers!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me start off by saying on know this is a tourist trap sort of place... but wow, the service was terrible. My wife ordered a burger and fries and I ordered a side salad and chicken wings. Both meals were good, nothing to brag about but we had no complaints about the food. Once we order d our food we didn't see our waitress again for awhile. The server brought the food out to the table, put the meals on the wrong side of the table and walked away.  After taking a few bites of the food I realized I was out of water and so was my wife. Waitress never came around to check on how the food was or if we needed any drinks. AFTER we were both done with our drinks she finally came to the table and asked how the meal was and if we needed anything. I told her just the check. At this point it was a little late for anything. It took her another 5-10 mins to bring the check.   I give this review a 3 because the food was good.  Service would get 0 if possible. Hard Rock has some work to do on customer service."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about the legendary Hard Rock Cafe for a long long time now and finally got the opportunity to go. Maybe my expectations were set to high but it was kind of a letdown. It was pretty cool to see the memorabilia and some of the crazy outfits celebrities have worn over the years, but I wasn't as blown away as I had expected.   The food was pretty good but the service was.. How do I put it... Weird? We were greeted by a younger waiter who we could tell was a little bit nervous. I guess he was in training and the lady training him was standing directly behind him. He was trying so hard but every so often she would correct him on the spot or offer us something he hadn't mentioned. We felt so bad for him because you could tell how hard he was trying and she made him look like he kept messing up. I felt so bad for the guy, that's not a good way to train employees in my opinion. After they leave the table she could have offered suggestions for improvement not correct him on the spot, that doesn't promote confidence. Before we were done eating the guy stopped by our table to say goodbye and that they were sending him home. The lady that was training him came over shortly afterward to say that he had to go home and it wasn't because of anything he did wrong. HOW AWKWARD!   Aside from that I ordered a huge burger and yes I ate the entire thing, it was yummy :). I ordered a Bloody Mary and it wasn't the best, nor were the onion rings that accompanied my burger. My friend said her Mac and cheese was good but not the best. The meal ended up being pretty pricey but I would prob go back, especially if it was during happy hour or something :)."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average but the ambiance and service is great. My dad is law was loving the music and videos that were playing and walking down memory lane. It was adorable!  We tried: Appetiser sampler - massive portion. Onion rings were very good, potato skins & wings were ok. Everything else was meh... Pull pork sandwich - surprisingly delicious BBQ trio - the chicken was amazing! smoky, grilled and so tender. The pull pork sandwich was good. Ribs were disappointing and dry Fries - Not bad. Mango Tango - pretty tasty and refreshing  Good for a quite bite and place to catch up since it is such a casual place with decent food."}
{"text":"I had the Legendary Burger at the Hard Rock Cafe and it was excellent. Sam was my waitress and she was on my drink order immediately. I will definitely visit again. The twisted mac & cheese is awesome also. It was clean and the staff was very friendly. My only dislike is the music selection chosen by hard rock radio. It is not the hard pop café or the top 20 café it is the \"hard rock\" café. Please play hard rock! The earning them only four stars."}
{"text":"Target customer: Anyone in a generic mood  I've been to the Hard Rock Cafe several times, usually because a friend suggests we grab a drink.  The location is right at Yonge-Dundas square, which is great for business. However, the incentive to do anything interesting is quite low.  There is nothing terrible about Hard Rock Cafe, but also nothing outside the norm. It seems to be fairly clean and has a corporate vibe to it.  They normally play classic rock in the background, which is decent enough."}
{"text":"Had to stop in here while in Vegas. We only wanted the avocado spring rolls that we've eaten all over the world and unfortunately, they no longer serve it at this HR. So we just got a beer and continued our walk. Cool place inside. Love seeing all the different HR's."}
{"text":"The food was three star , but as a server myself service was five  stars.  Our server Summer,helped me navigate the menu for my food allergies which all came out good. She got y daughter her food right away. But was just all around really awesome server."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends ordered take out from here and the food was ready promptly, the BBQ burger was delicious and thick, BUT I got like 8 fries, and after paying $17 I expected to get more food. When I asked the waitress about the small amount of fries I received, she gave me attitude. I'm not sure if I'd go back here because it's not worth the stress or my money."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday at around 5 right before the Green Day concert. We were seated immediately, and had a very nice, attentive waitress. The food was outstanding, the banana pina-colada smoothie I had was to die for, and I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Let's address this first , I did a Yelp search for Kid Friendly restaurants and Hard Rock was way down the list... but this should not be the case.  Hard Rock is very kid friendly... bring the kiddos!  Located in Station Square with loads and loads of activities all around.  We did an early a Ducky Tour and knew we would need to have a place to go that was close by after the tour.  Especially with 3 kids in tow.  Initially we were worried that the Hard Rock might be too loud, however the tour came with a discount coupon for Hard Rock... so off we went.  We were seated in the main dining area.  Lots of tvs around and music memorabilia that you expect here.  Every single staff member said hello to the kids and treated us amazing.  Our waiter attended to them first and made sure each time they were taken care of.  Kids get their own cool guitar plates too.  Seriously I was impressed with all the kid friendly features.  On to the adult stuff... good selection of brews and yes the food was excellent.  I went with the grilled wings (with the spicy rub) and a salad that came with a white balsamic dressing.  I really enjoyed it.  The ladies in our group got buffalo cauliflower as an app, and they loved it.  And that's the thing... lots of options for all different kinds of eaters.  I was really happy and wouldn't hesitate at all enjoying some food and drinks again here.  Again... did I mention how kid friendly they are!! Hope my review moves them up a few spots at least."}
{"text":"Been to one, been to 'em all. Other than the city on the merchandise, they're all the same. This one is pretty small compared to most, but the outside seating area is great when its warm.  I feel like the menu has gotten pretty small though.. Maybe its just me? I don't know if I'm imagining things but it just seems like there aren't a lot of choices anymore. The food is decent, but I wish there were more entrée and salad options. Their salads are just boring! Grilled chicken Cobb, grilled chicken chopped, grilled chicken arugula and ceasar.. That's it! Anyway, just like any HRC, the atmosphere is cool and its a fun place, but I just wish there was more to be desired from the menu. That's just me."}
{"text":"I'm assuming this is the Hard Rock at Mandalay. I went for Breakfast one am. First off, they aren't open for breakfast until 8am, which I thought was more than strange considering the crazy hours one makes while in Vegas. I had jet lag during the trip and was eating breakfast at 630am and 730am and heck sometimes my friends weren't getting in til 9am!   Anyway, I digress... I ordered the standard 2 egg breakfast. It was massive. 2 people could easily split it. My only issue is that it was crazy greasy...even for this southern girl. Maybe they make it that way for all the drunks who need the grease to soak up the alcohol but it just made me feel sick. They were nice enough to sub out the bread for fruit and there was a lot of it. Service was a bit slow also. Otherwise, great value for the money."}
{"text":"Had dry rub cauliflower \"wings,\" an appreciated vegetarian creation. No complaints about food, and the outside seating area was wonderful with the Station Square fountain show and music."}
{"text":"I had to wait too, get a signal lamp, which light show a free table. The steak was burned too much, with some beer you will not real notice. But for me a must, like in Chicago or elswhere."}
{"text":"It's Ok.  If you're in Vegas visit the place.  The service was very good (slow night) but the food is not so great.  It's a tourist trap, just like most of the restaurants/bars on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Not a big variety f food here at this hard rock and the beer was watm nd even the bartender said that it has been that way for months"}
{"text":"@hardrocktoronto #HARDROCKCAFE #YELP #TORONTO #DUNDASSQUARE  Hard Rock has its novelty value, and that never fails to impress me - their decor is unique at every location and the Hard Rock ambience is fantastic. However, having been to Hard Rock in different countries, the cafe in Toronto falls a tad short.   Customer Service: It's alright. Wait times can be long for dinner. And once we were denied seats because we were wet in the rain.   Seating: Love those round booth seating for groups. The tables are a tad tight.   Food: Pricey, okay quality. New York striploin is $29 on the menu - usually $20-$25 in other similar restaurants. I'd pay that kind of money for Filet Mignon.  Drinks: $10+ for most.   Order Details:  We got the Jumbo platter as a shared appetizer. For 8 of us, definitely wasn't enough, although it gives you a variety of shareables to try. Perfect for a group of 3-4 people.   I ordered the New York Striploin medium rare. It came rare. I was in a good mood and slightly tipsy, reasons why I didn't send my steak back to the kitchen.   We also ordered a pitcher of sangria shared between 5 of us. Tasty, but I wish it was fruitier. I love some berries in my sangria. Others ordered beer.   Margarita rating: N/A (didn't try one here)   An observation: They added a 18% gratuity on the bill. That's the group rate, I am guessing.  BTW: I wish they hadn't taken those delicious blue cheese sliders off of the menu.  Verdict? Probably coming back. Novelty value."}
{"text":"*4 STARS for the patio view*  Enjoyed an early lunch here. Best place to eat on a nice warm day is on the patio. Food was okay, nothing out of the ordinary, but good enough to satisfy our hunger.  Can't really give a full review on the food because all I ordered was their potato skins. Again, pretty average..."}
{"text":"Recently came here as part of a large group.  I wasn't really expecting much, but the Hard Rock exceeded my expectations.  Service was fast and the servers were attentive.  The house salad here was comprised of some simple mixed greens, onions, and a sliced tomato.  Not bad.  I then ordered the Chicken Marsala.  Surprisingly good.  The chicken was cooked just right and grilled to perfection.  It came accompanied with mushrooms, green beans and pasta.  All quite good.  If I came here again, I would totally order this.  Overall, Hard Rock is a great place to meet large groups of people.  They also are positioned in Station Sq., which provides great views of the city."}
{"text":"My buddies and I were looking for breakfast outside of our hotel after putting back a few drinks the night before. We were going to hit the Denny's on the Strip, but the line was absurdly long and we had to be somewhere later that morning, so we popped into the Hard Rock Cafe since we saw that they had a breakfast menu.  We went upstairs to the restaurant and were promptly seated out on the patio which has a great view of the Strip. It was another gorgeous day in Vegas and the sun was starting to really heat things up.  We started the meal off in a very manly way - mimosas and cocktails. I wasn't originally going to get a big breakfast, but the chicken and biscuits were too tempting.   A short wait later, our food arrived and it was apparent that the kitchen just thought I had ordered a biscuits and gravy as my chicken was quite absent. After waving down a waiter, he said he would take it back to the kitchen and get the chicken. Unfortunately, fried chicken isn't the quickest thing to get done on the fly, so by the time my plate came back, my friends were already done eating. Our waitress was great though, and was actually getting ticked off that the food was taking so long to come back.   When it did finally arrive, it looked quite good with a good-sized piece of chicken on two country gravy-slathered biscuits. The golden brown batter was nice and crunchy, although the boneless chicken breast had a texture suggesting that it came from a freezer. The gravy was rich and hearty but the biscuits weren't so much the dense but flaky texture of a good biscuit, but closer to that of cake. It was odd. Not bad, just odd.  My buddy whose birthday it was received a complimentary birthday sundae and a free glass as well, which was really cool, and the waitress knocked $5 off our bill for all the hassle. All in all, she was a champ.  The food was kinda meh, but its a great location and the front end service was spot on. Swing on by, just not for the  biscuits."}
{"text":"Came here before a concert and had the Mac and cheese...best of my life!!! So mug fun and the staff was so chill and attentive to us at the bar even with it being so crowded."}
{"text":"I decided to give the Hard Rock Cafe another try, this time we just went in for dinner before going to a concert. I made a reservation for 6:30 and this time, we took a cab from our hotel so the lack of free, easy to access parking was a non-factor.  Upon arrival we headed up the escalator and was greated by a photographer. She handed me a guitar, we struck some rockstar poses while she snapped a couple shots. Then it was off to get seated.   Our hostess was friendly and tried to make small talk while she took us to our table. The eating area of the Hard Rock Cafe was almost identical to the club area, which is one floor up. The only differences I saw were the additional tables, and different memorabilia.   Our waitress was friendly and we were able to place orders for drinks quickly after being seated. My husband decided to order the pulled pork and ribs combo plate, I had a sirloin steak. When we ordered, the waitress gave him a choice in the sauces for the pulled pork, he went with vinegar.  After placing our food order, someone came by with the photo that had been taken when we entered. $20 later we had a 5x7 in a simple, touristy frame and 2 smaller photos. Pretty gimmicky but a nice way to remember the evening.  Food was brought out promptly. Not too fast but fast enough. I tried a little of the pulled pork, I was glad my husband went with the vinegar based sauce. Very tasty. He seemed to really enjoy the ribs as well.  My steak was fine, nothing exceptional.  I really did like that it was served with snap peas though.   Overall, a better experience then my first visit. Food was  good, a little on the pricier side but nothing we weren't expecting. Not really a place I think I'd feel the urge to return to often though. Maybe when people visit from out of town..."}
{"text":"Christen was a great server.  The food was so so but hey it's the hard rock. You can't expect too much.   Our server and her smile made the difference"}
{"text":"Walked in while on our vacation here in Vegas and usually I'm a bit skeptical about Hard Rock Cafe's but today's experience set that all aside for me. So we went up to the second floor and the hostess found us a nice comfy booth where our friendly server Lauren greeted us and explained our options for dining. She really made the experience positive by going above and beyond. She checked on us multiple times. And even was very fast with our food. Loved it. Thanks to you Lauren"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and excellent environment. Pricing is good for the amount of food that you get. Fajita was excellent and worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Hard Rock Cafe because it was across the street from the arena. The wait was about 15 minutes to be seated, but it seemed like there were many empty tables when we went in. We ordered the Texan sandwich, the Honey Mustard grilled chicken sandwich, and a kids cheese pizza. The food arrived cold, and although the sandwiches still tasted good regardless of the temperature, the kids pizza was wretched. It tasted like they spooned tomato paste into the dough and sparsely dropped cheese on it.  This took 45 minutes to get this food.   I guess I'd be ok with that if I hadn't paid almost $14 for a chicken sandwich that was only ok. I could've paid less for fast food and and been just as happy. I do love the theme there, but the service didn't even justify the food. The server left us with empty drinks and pretty much didn't come back until she dropped off the check. Everyone has a bad night but they weren't even that busy. For good reason, I guess."}
{"text":"Was a great place to grab a late lunch , located in the middle of the strip. Our party went for a meat feast with lots if BBQ chicken , ribs and a few chicken salads. Location wise we sat outside on a high table which gave a great view of the strip."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the service in Las Vegas restaurants (particularly on the Strip) seem to have one common theme - POOR SERVICE  The Hard Rock Cafe is no exception to this observation.   I get it. You work in a tourist trap. You get mixed (good and bad) tips regardless of effort because you are serving people from different cultures and different tipping beliefs, but that shouldn't mean you just disappear.   This week my girlfriend and I met up for lunch with a couple of friends that happened to also be visiting Vegas. We tried to get them to choose a non-chain, but they argued that they knew what to expect with a chain. Fine... Hard Rock it was.   We walked in, walked up the stairs, put our name down. The place was basically empty since it was about 2:00 p.m., so we were seated in about 5 minutes. This is where the service begins and ends.   We sat there with menus for 15 minutes (this is no exaggeration) . We flagged down several people and asked them if they could find a server for us, but instead they just kept walking by obnoxiously singing along with the music playing in the background (or in some cases, just shouting out lyrics to unrelated songs). I THINK the servers think this is 'entertaining', but I can tell you that none of us at our table were impressed - especially after waiting that long.   Once the waiter arrived (sweating), he apologized profusely, feeding us with several disjunct reasons. We presented him with 2 for 1 drink cards that were distributed by the people standing in front of the restaurant. He seemed to be clueless as to their validity. He ran back to his manager and came back confirming the 'deal'. We were debating on whether or not this waiter was drunk, as he just seemed disconnected.  Anyway... We ordered our food. It was what you expect from any chain restaurant like this, fairly bland, generic, etc. If you are not familiar with Hard Rock Cafe, it is basically a TGIFriday or Chili's with a Rock-n-Roll theme (walls covered in rock memorabilia). Needless to say, you are paying for the ambiance and to look at the rock memorabilia, not the food. Once you wrap your head around that, the prices are... well... still too high for what you get.  I would suggest avoiding all of the 'sit-down' restaurants that have doors that open to the Strip. They have a non-stop line of customers coming in, so they know they don't need to work hard. As for the Hard Rock Cafe, I would just avoid it regardless of the country you are in. This is a relic from the 70s and 80s that just doesn't know when it is time to close the doors."}
{"text":"My 6 oz. burger with Jack and bacon was so good here!! We came here on a Sunday afternoon for a quick lunch. The place was quiet for noon when we first entered. A few minutes later, the hungover crowds came, which made the noise level go up significantly. On a side note, I thought the decor was pretty cool in the restaurant.   In a nutshell, the service was great and the food was great. I'd definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Pros Amazingly consistent good food Rare rock 'n' roll memorabilia collection Regular live music Outdoor eating area  Cons:  No visible tv screens from all tables  Not playing rock videos from the few screens they had (playing sports, um if I wanted to see sports I would have went to a sports bar)  *super disappointing, as this is usually my favorite chain restaurant, but all the things I love about them is left out at this place. Except the delicious food."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio, watched the view, and jammed to the music while having dinner. Our server was Tina. She was very nice. The wait time for a table was minimal.   We bought some tshirts downstairs after dinner. The staff there were very friendly as well. No, shopping in the gift shop isn't a requirement. Yet, I get a Hardrock Cafe tshirt at each location that I've been.   If you like buffalo wings, then make sure you get some from here before you leave Vegas. You won't be disappointed.   The shrimp are good. The BBQ sandwich seemed to have something missing.   Would you I recommend this restaurant? Yes."}
{"text":"STEAK AND EGGS EGGS AND STEAK.   Best place to grab your late night after clubbing snack.   Okay, we had a really nice waiter, but the guy who was pouring our water gave us false pricing information. He told us that the special (steak and eggs) was only $9.99 but it was actually $18.99 (pricey)   Luckily we had our price adjusted and came up with a half off meal. The steak and eggs come with 4 slices of toast and hash browns. There was a ton of food and very plentiful.   I was very satisfied. If you end up only wanting to pay $9.99 there's the steak and hash one."}
{"text":"Had a get together for a friend.  I had the chicken Marsala, and the hubby had ribs.  The food was decent, and fairly priced, but the service was excellent.  Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and just plain awesome.  For example, I accidentally ordered a non-alcoholic drink, and asked for a shot of rum to add to it.  She brought me an entirely different drink.  That's gutsy.  But she made a good assessment of the drink I ordered and made a decision about what I might like.  Good choice, and great observation.     The manager came by to check on us.  On his second check, a person at our table realized he didn't like his meal to no fault of the cafe, he just didn't like it.  His meal was promptly replaced, and offered a free shot.  Also, our sever handled our moderately sized party with grace and speed.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"We went to have a drink and some wings on my birthday. We were seated and the waiter came over to take our order. We ordered our drinks and the wings. Several groups of 4 came in and sat next to us. Mind you, we ordered a single order of wings. Both groups that came in after us ordered full meals. They Actually got their food before us and had just about finished before we got our wings! I have to say the waiter was very good about it and made several trips back to the kitchen to see what was going on. The wings finally came out and looked terrible. The plating was terrible as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I (under 21) went to Las Vegas a few months ago, and on one long day on the strip we decided to stop in for lunch, despite the fact that we knew eating on the strip would be pricey. We were not disappointed. The service was better than any we had received that trip, and the food was delicious as well. We sat outside and enjoyed our food while we watched the busy strip go by. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was fine and friendly, location was central to a lot of other places in the Sheraton Square. Would have liked to walk around more and look out on the river, but was too blustery the night we visited.  The food was about what you expected, a couple things missing from the last time I visited a Hard Rock elsewhere a few years ago, but since I don't go all of the time, not sure if they just updated the menu or what.  Place was pretty quiet when we were there, but the music and video selection was kind of odd, it literally went from Shakira to classic 70s at times.  Overall, not a bad experience, but if there are other choices that you can explore, why not try something new?"}
{"text":"I went to a concert at the Hard Rock on the Strip last night.  It was my first time to this one.  I have to say, I am impressed.  The third floor venue is a bit of a hike for a lazy bum like me.  I took the stairs though there is an optional elevator.  I was concered how the concert was going to be pulled off given the nature of the act.  I saw GWAR, a group known for eleborate stage shows that saturate the audience, floor and surrounding areas with a red simulated blood and green slime.  I noticed when I walked in the memorabilia walls and support columns were wrapped in plastic sheets.  Smart move.  Security was tight upon entering.  Everybody had to take everything out of their pockets and get patted down and wanded.  It took a while (think busy airport) but I felt safe.  During the show security guards were taking down crowd surfing drunks.  It was entertaining.  Over all, the concert venue at the Hard Rock is like a bigger, cleaner and more modern looking version of the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  They have very similar set ups.  Down side of the eveing, the cheapest beer was PBR for $5.  That is a lot to pay for a pint of PBR.  That complaint aside, I had a great time for a great price (ticket cost).  I plan to go back if they continue to bring in the good acts."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. Memorabilia wasn't that great - my teenage daughter had never heard of most of them.  Tip: Kids eat free sometimes, but you have to ask your server about it."}
{"text":"Decided to come in here for lunch because it wasn't crowded at all. Our server was this lady who seemed to be overly bored/tired, but she'd try to give us a smile every now and then. We had to constantly be on the lookout for her the whole time to get some refills, get boxes, get the check, ask for a spoon that she failed to bring with the soup my husband ordered, etc. There were a few tables occupied so I don't know why she wasn't more attentive to her clients. And to top it off, food (rock burger and pulled pork sandwich)was bland and mediocre, so it didn't even compensate for the almost 30 minute wait time for it to arrive. Not worth my time."}
{"text":"This is a Review of The Hard Rock Live Concert Room...  Last Night I went with My Sister & Her Family to a Concert Venue at the Hard Rock Cafe! I have to admit it was Da Bomb! The Employees that Worked that Venue were All Very Pleasant, Happy People! They Checked the Concert-Goers ID's (it was an 18+) Concert! They Placed those Paper Bracelets on All of us in a Timely, yet Professional Manner! and Checked our Bags & Did that Whole Security Wand Very Quickly!   What Impressed Me was how Fast Those Employees were at Clearing up the Tables! I'm not sure how the Dancefloor was but the Bar Area was Managed & Handled Well! There were People with Garbage Cans Cleaning Around without any Problem! Security Was Visible, and Aware of Potential Problems!  There is/are A lot of Seating All Around the Concert Room, You had Barstool type Seating, or you Could sit in 3 Different Areas where you could have a View of the Las Vegas Strip, sit in Comfortable Sofas, and Chill with your Drink & Dance in your Seat! lol  I Would Come back for A Concert here!!! Love the Environment...  =)"}
{"text":"I popped in halfheartedly wondering if I could get a seat any time soon and I was at a table in about 3-4 minutes.  Only a few minutes later Tony had my Sailor Jerry and Coke in front of me.  Staff was friendly and on the ball and the food was good and quick.  I'm definitely now a fan and will hit the place up again next time I'm in town.  Kudos for actually having Sailor Jerry as most of the places on the strip have drank the Captain Morgan kool-aide."}
{"text":"Great location to people watch from the second floor patio seating area. But be cautious of the sun because it gets really hot. Basic menu nothing exciting about it. Great for a quick bite to eat. Decently priced"}
{"text":"Honestly... I was completed disappointed. I went there with a very large party.. maybe 20 people. We were separated in two tables, totally fine...would of expected exceptional service with the split up.  Our server was mediocre. You could tell she didnt want the party. She kept asking me if we were ready, what we wanted to do etc. I told her to check with the party host...it wasnt my party I didnt know what the plan was. But she kept asking me.  It seemed like she wanted to keep rushing us.  We had a $25 banquet like menu. We had a couple in the group who for religious reasons couldnt have pork, and 4/5 options contained pork. 5/5 contained meat so I guess if you are vegetarian you were SOL because they wouldnt allow customization.  We begged and begged for no bacon on the burger and she said no they wont allow. I mean you have a group paying you so much paying and you just wont put in the bacon on...its easier for you. Well, his GF made it clear...dont bring that back with bacon.  Sure enough it had bacon. The server just said \"its fine just pull it off\", and he explained again... for religious purposes it cant touch at all. So weird they wouldn't allow. I got my food and it said it came with beans and coleslaw which I never received...nor did anyone who order dishes with sides even get them. A little annoying considered the $25 price. We all received our food and all agreed it was not good. I got sick from the ribs... No one was happy with their meal. No one wanted to say anything because they didnt want to upset the birthday girl. Very very basic.  Next for dessert...on our menu it said \"bakers choice\"... I was SO excited for something delicious. We all received 2 cookies. LOL just kind of humorous as this point. That was your bakers big plan for dessert? I ws completely disapointed with the Hard Rock. I havent been there since I was a kid and remembered it being so good. Save your money."}
{"text":"Walked in not expecting much from a chain restaurant like HRC, but I was actually quite surprised on how good the food was. Staff very friends and service was great. Fun atmosphere, with a great location and view of the strip. Worth checking out"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food was mediocre at best -- and certainly not worth the overinflated prices. Regretted that we didn't walk another 25 yards to the Buca di Beppo."}
{"text":"Its chain of course, but one of the better ones in the Hard Rock chain, having better décor and atmosphere to it than most of the other ones I have been to. Everything is super clean, well organized, orderly and with a quality service staff.   Uniquely, this Hard Rock is actually entered through a mall (Tower City Mall), but has the usual rather overpriced souvenirs and run of the mill type of food not only common in taste and quality to other Hard Rocks but also what might be typical of a T.G.I. Friday's or a Bennigan's. It's touristy and gimmicky, but such is the allure of a Hard Rock."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch during our last visit to Vegas. Which was actually our breakfast. The place is awesome, especially for music lovers! We both ordered the bloody mary's which were good. My husband had some burger with buffalo sauce, bacon, and blue cheese, which he loved. I had the bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce. They were both yummy, and the fries were so good. My husband I think fell in love with the place when they told him they could put cheese and bacon on his french fries.   We will definately be coming back here."}
{"text":"We were here on vacation a few years back and had the BEST beef nacho salad ever! The waiter was real courteous/good natured toward my fiancée and I the entire time. We'll definitely head back for those Nachos next time we're in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"With so many other places to spend your time in Vegas, this HRC is a-ok. Compared to other HRC's across America, this one is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I stopped in just for souvenirs and was treated great! The person behind the counter was super friendly. There were two other people there complaining about the price of some of the items and asked if they could get a discount or anything and he politely explained no. He made some suggestions as to what I should purchase and I am completely satisfied with my purchase! Love visiting all of the Hard Rock Cafe's when we're out traveling!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to hang out on a day like this.  When it's hot out and you can't stand to be inside a casino or out on the strip.  Hard Rock Cafe has an awesome menu and stocked bar complete with mini stage for the occasional impromptu concert.  Try the burgers.  This location is located near the MGM and Ross Dress for Less.  Look for the giant electric guitar.  As a bonus, at any given time of day, you'll see your favorite celebrity impersonators out front."}
{"text":"This is one of the more vintage Hard Rock Cafes, with the wood paneling and the more hippy funk feel.  It is kept up perfectly and is wonderously clean, a standard to which all other Hard Rocks should aspire.  The menu is tasty, not a huge wow.  They do a much better job of delivering the standards than many other Hard Rock kitchens do, though, I should add.  Potato skins and good drinks go a long way.  But you're not here for the food. You're here for the overall experience. The music. The memorabilia.  Service here is EXCELLENT.  You don't compare this to a foodie joint because they're apples and oranges. This Hard Rock scores a five star because it does what it sets out to do admirably well."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch. They had live music playing and they were pretty busy. They sat us within 10 minutes so the wait wasn't long at all. The waiter was very friendly, made suggestions and a few jokes. We all ordered breakfast and it was served hot and fresh. I ordered eggs, bacon and toast. My husband ordered a waffle and sausage. The food was great and the atmosphere we fun."}
{"text":"It has become a pretty iconic place.  Food is pretty typical american, but prepared relatively well.  Hosts are not that professional, but our server was very very good - friendly and attentive.  What seemed strange - for the dishes that are priced similarly  - some have huge portions and some are very small.   Few dessert options were a disappointment as well.  They could easily improve on that."}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours only to be told it would be about another 46 minutes, an hour and half longer than we were told at check in. There were 18 tables open- help me understand why for a concert that was booked a year in advance this restaurant wasn't prepared for a busy day. Sad, overpriced, poor service , relying on the marketing of the brand while delivering so little. I will never spend a dime at Hard Rock in the future!  The GM ran around not knowing what to do, if I owned this restaurant, I'd take a serious look at my management staff."}
{"text":"We had such a glovely dinner at hard rock. It was truly like no other. How often do you get served an extra used glove in your sandwich, completely free of charge? Amazing.   Ok, in all seriousness, thank goodness my friend didn't take a bite out of this. It was disgusting and no manager even came out to apologize. The glove was inside out, used and smack in the middle of her sandwich. They also gave my other friend the wrong burger....   Just another place to avoid like the plague"}
{"text":"We were in town for a concert. We stopped for dinner & drinks the night before. They were having a fundraiser for kids & had kid bands playing. We were so impressed. Our waiter was Louis. He was on it!! He was super friendly & helpful. And quick & efficient. The manager Jennifer was awesome.  We came back next day for lunch because Jennifer said they had live music on the patio. There came up an incident on another table. The manager Jennifer took care of it with ease. I would recommend this restaurant and their staff any day. Thanks for making our girls weekend memorable"}
{"text":"It's a fun place for a quick bite. The food is consistently good and the staff is friendly. It's loud and usually crowded on game nights, but that's what it's for. Overall it's a bit overpriced ,but it's a fun place with good food"}
{"text":"Other than the cool multi-touch wall, service and food was disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant on the Strip, food is average, a little bit disappointed with an other Hard Rock Cafe... Flatbread is ok but the dessert was too industrial. Employees was friendly."}
{"text":"Super fun waitress.. She was very funny... Drinks are not great and food was not the Hard rock I know... Very disappointed but loved the waitress."}
{"text":"Food was good but had no idea that the place was that big! Service was great! Try their cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Thursday night around 6 it was somewhat dead, it started to pick up when we were leaving. Great live music started around 8. Ordered some garlic fries and onion rings to start they were ok, not very hot. We also had the chicken fajitas, they were great! The service was also great!"}
{"text":"Llegué a este maravilloso lugar pára desayunar, está muy lindo decorado con fotos y recuerdos de ROck Star!! Me encantó el vestido de Lisa Minelli y los del rey Elvis!!! Tenés que subir al 1 piso, en donde tenés una mejor vista de la StRIp, la música estaba muy buena, también hubo una cantante extraordinaria, como era pasadas las 10am, pedí los huevos Benedict que venían con papitas, y un exquisito te . Muy buena atención especialmente por el simpático y amable ALE!! Para volver y pasar gratos momentos."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars, almost embarrassed to be caught in such a tourist destination but what the hey, client is buying.    You come here for the gift shop and atmosphere, not for the food lol.  Ordered the nachos, which were good except for the beans.  They ordered burgers which looked pretty average to me.  Nice red velvet round booth seating on the left, good for meetings as they were several feet away from the main table seating area."}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend on a Saturday morning for brunch. Got seated within 10mins. Our server did a fantastic job at attending us. Ordered the \"Whole Lotta Love\" Breakfast Burger & comes with a side of potatoes. Very great choice, delicious & great for a hangover. They even had live music going on & not too pricey for being on the strip. The only disappointment is that I live 200miles away but I'll be back when I visit Vegas again"}
{"text":"Loved their bottomless mimosas! Their breakfast was great too would def go back to try out other dishes. The service was good and always made sure our cups were full!"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents (Hi Guys!) and Wife (stop looking at me like that) and had a great time, the service was A-MAZ-ING and the food was nice, I think we were getting a little sick of burgers by then and needed a break."}
{"text":"I've been to the Hard Rock for three different types of experiences: dining, special event, and concert. This is definitely a world class Hard Rock Cafe. From the interactive screens at the lobby, and select tables, to the decor and the staff.   The food is pretty consistent, and they have good options for those with dietary restrictions.   As a local, I found the staff to be very accommodating to both locals and tourists. I witnessed the staff giving genuine recommendations to tourists, and joking around with the occasional local that stops by.   Beyond the typical HRC experience, I've been very impressed with the concert venue on the top floor. I've seen both international acts and local acts in the concert hall. During concerts the venue is very intimate, and there is not a bad seat (mostly standing room, but you get the idea) in the house save the area behind the bar that overlooks the strip.   The sound is good, not the best I've seen, but for the type of venue it is more than adequate.   I look forward to concerts at the HRC because the parking is easy (just park in the Showcase mall, you have to pay, but it is worth it), and you can always see the band. The security can be a little hardcore (patting down kids at an all ages show), but as far as small venues go on the Strip, this one is outstanding."}
{"text":"It's on the strip in Vegas, so don't expect low prices or good service. We sat a the bar and the bartender let us sit for 10 minutes before talking to us. Her attitude was poor and she was not friendly. The food and wine were good. The restaurant had a average \"Hard Rock\" decor."}
{"text":"Ha! It had been at least a decade since I was in a Hard Rock Cafe. I guess I forgot about them after Bruce Willis and Demi Moore divorced? ;). This was the only restaurant with available reservations before a local concert, so I booked it with limited expectations. Well, there was a party going on here and it exceeded my expectations. Good food with generous portions, fun and friendly staff, fun and strong drinks. It was a winner! I enjoyed my bbq bacon cheese burger. The burger was juicy, loosely packed and perfectly cooked. I was able to substitute broccoli for fries. My friend really enjoyed her large  serving of macaroni and cheese with grilled chicken. There was a DJ somewhere that kept the party going. Great pre-event option in the area."}
{"text":"I ate here because we had tickets to a show nearby but there wasn't anything great that stood out about the place. There were some highlights when it came to the staff and some of the décor, but the food was just not that great.  Staff: Our waiter, I think his name was Glen, was great. He was friendly and chatted with us. He kept our waters filled and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a busy Friday night, but all-in-all couldn't ask for more.  Ambience: It is loud. Like... very loud. So I would not recommend for a larger party because you won't be able to hear them anyway. The décor is cool, there is some stuff that's been signed by musicians and artists. They also play music videos on the screens so sometimes it could be a nice conversation piece (e.g. ERMAGERD LADY GAGA!!). We had a booth in the back but there was this large party that was set up next to us which essentially created a bit of a barricade when we wanted to leave or step out to the washroom.  Food: I had the chicken fajitas, nothing too special about it. They did give me a plate of onions and about 2 or 3 slivers of peppers, so that was a bit awkward. The chicken was dry but there was plenty of meat. Unfortunately, I felt like I could've used another tortilla rather than stuffing each one full of chicken. I stole a couple of fries off my date and they were good. But the price of the meal seemed high to me for the quality of food.  Overall, the food was alright, and they needed to work on their portions. The staff there are friendly, but the food portion and quality, plus the volume levels, puts this place low on my list of places to eat in the city."}
{"text":"My experience was alright. The food was average. I was expecting amazing from all the buss about this place. Our waiter was sub-par and not very attentive to us, or nice for that matter and there was this really loud and obnoxious blonde waitress's that kept yelling and singing very badly to the music. She didn't even know the words. Very annoying. Just cause it wasn't that busy doesn't mean there aren't customers here. It was so annoying to eat with this waitress walking around being so irritating."}
{"text":"Cody did a great job. We got here right before a Suns game and the place was pretty busy. We were seated fairly quickly and ordered the sampler platter. Food was great and came in a timely manner, drinks as well. Shout out to Cody who was really personable and never stopped moving. When we do come back, he'll be the one we ask for."}
{"text":"We had breakfast and the prices are reasonable considering it is located on the strip. The food was good. My only complain is the bench was too high, my feet were hanging. It was not really comfortable. There was no footrest."}
{"text":"Well they made everything right ... I called back to verify if there were more rooms/floors for smoking ..Isabel at the front desk is who took my call regarding the wrong room preference.. she actually offered more than the second floor which was interesting because I was told there was only the second floor for smoking in the Paradise towers by David. She actually gave me options which included a suite in the HRH suites.. I told her to book me the room & I would wait for Stephanie to arrive at 11:00 to speak with her regarding the mistake .. Isabel said no problem .. I will book this room & will have Stephanie call you .. no more than 7 minutes later ..Isabel called back & said due to the inconvenience we will switch you to the suite at the same rate .. I told her thank You and she sent a bell man.. 10 minutes later Jeffery our bell man arrived & was GREAT.. he had a super sweet personality & good conversation .. NOW JEFF is a true definition of grand customer service. I must say .. Hard Rock Cafe redeemed themselves. I'll book here for Rehab come MAY 2017.. thanks Hard ROCK for making it right!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The breakfast potatoes were amazing! Price was about $11-15 per meal. The service was super slow for it not being busy."}
{"text":"Bring a flare gun to get the attention of a server, any server. Why?   If you are not a tourist, yet you find yourself sitting outside because the last of the good weather has seduced you to the patio after the baton death march from shopping accross the street please be prepared to wait.  It's not that business is so spectacular. It's that the patio servers can't seem to be bothered. You've been warned..Wish someone had done the same 4 me.."}
{"text":"Bf and I dined at the Hard Rock Cafe on 8/20/13.  The service is blameless.  We ordered the ribs, which was very dry and even brittle in some areas.  We enjoyed being here on a week night.  We came to Vegas for MAGIC.  The Hard Rock Cafe was not as crowded."}
{"text":"Located inside Hard Rock Live on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. This is perfect place to have dinner before catching a show upstairs at the music venue. Try the burger of the month, it is usually quite insane, the one I had, was a burger with avocado, bacon and shrimp! The service is great and the prices reasonable for the strip. I should mention how much fun it is to check out all the music memorabilia hanging on the walls. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"A typical HRC. You would think being in Vegas it would be lively & more impressive. The gift shop was out of both items we were looking for. I probably won't visit again...been there done that."}
{"text":"This was our (my family and I) second visit and yet again an outstanding experience.  Place is super clean and full with classic Rock music.  We got there around 10:45am - greeted and host offered us very good booth - but my daughter (8yrs old) wanted to sit inside - same place where we sat for the first time. Host was very happy to change our tables - no fuss!!! Our server (Star of the whole experience) Ashley came and took our order for beverages.  She even helped us with couple of items in menu and recommeded sauc for my chicken - which happeded to be the best choice.  My daughter was bit upset for somereason and was crying.  Ashley took a note of that but didnt say anything.  Our food came and it was awesome except my daughter didn't like the Pizza she ordered.  She told Ashley when she came to check on us....She took the Pizza off of our check! At the end of our lunch, Ashley said that she has a surprise for my daughter and brought a cup of ice-cream!!! Put a big smile on her (my daughter's) face.... Ashley saved the day for us....She even took a pin (Disney pin) out of her pin belt and gifted to my daughter.  She went above and beyond to make our dining experience awesome and she did that.    Yes the food is bit pricey, but you will enjoy your visit with your date, family, friends, colleagues, spouse or even just treating your self to lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Perhaps back in the days this was a good spot to meet at , but now with all the amazing restaurant I feel it has lost its charm. Eight of us went here for dinner on a Friday night. We had a plate of mixed appetizers which was good. I would recommend this for sharing and getting the conversations going! I love potatoes skins, and for the main I had the crunchy chicken salad. The salad was good as well, I only like crunchy salad, and the slices of avocado topping it made it that much delightful.   It was a pleasant experience, but nothing too memorable."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  Lots of great memorabilia and an interactive wall.  Nice bar with great, friendly service and of course a gift shop for all your souvenir needs."}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice and clean but the service needs to be improved. My wife daughter and I walked in to have dinner. The greeter asked how many in our party. I said 3 and they said ok we will put you in the back. Didn't understand why we were being buried in the back and I felt somewhat insulted. Not worried about it because I will never go here again. This is why I am writing this to make sure that none of my friends or fellow yelpers get hosed like I did. It gets better so please read on.   Shortly after being seated our waiter Larry showed up and seemed very nice. My wife ordered a water, my daughter ordered a pink lemonade and I ordered a Guinness. Larry was slick with pressuring my wife to order a frozen drink. I noticed that on the menu you could ask the waiter about purchasing a pint glass or a hurricane glass for an additional fee. we were never offered if we even wanted to purchase the glasses. Larry decided that we needed them. When I ordered my meal I ordered The Texan. I ate the meal and it was not that bad. Larry was helpful and courteous. Then I got the bill and found that I was charged the 17.50 super sized price for the meal vs the 13.50 price that I noticed was on the menu. I didn't ask nor was I offered the super sized meal for the 17.50 price. Larry was slick again and had gotten over on me. I had not noticed anything at this point on the check. Larry tried to get us to have dessert but we passed on it. Larry had asked me to do a customer survey as he gets great feedback from his job. I assured him that I would give him feedback. He also sat at our table and tried to explain something else to us about a menu item that was not on our table. we declined to have it and Larry said I just had to tell you about it because I always forget.  This Larry guy basically got over on us and made us pay for things that we really didn't want. I could have gone back up stairs and made a scene but I figured I would just tell everyone what they did to me and hope that no one else gets taken. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!! I am sure that his company makes him do these things to people and this is why you must go down stairs to pay for your meal. They are a sneaky and they got me this once. Never again!! FK U HARD ROCK!!"}
{"text":"So if your in to Rock this would be a place to good, great atmosphere, but and theres always a but. Even though the food was good and served pretty fast, its a bit on the over priced side and I got the feeling that that Waitress was wanted us out quickly, so we didn't really get a chance to sit and chat or enjoy the surroundings. So over all it wasn't bad."}

{"text":"great atmosphere-100% rock n roll. good service unless it's really busy!! lots of seating mostly booths. a large circular bar & lots of tv's playing music videos. the burgers are the best sround.seasoned & cooked perfectly & huge!!! a little pricy-2 people can eat for @ $50. we enjoy the burgers & of course the $8 chocolate shakes!! a must if you are visiting."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero I honestly would, the entrees we got (burgers, ribs, rib eye steaks) were all completely flavorless without some sort of sauce. I got the BBQ chicken combo and it tasted as if it was doused in salt. The only thing we honestly liked was the fries and drinks. When we talked to the manager he stated that there have been no complaints about this place ever but seeing some of the reviews here I'm guessing he doesn't care for his online reviews. The server was great but manager was completely rude and the food was bland. We're not all that picky (especially after all working in restaurants) but this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day brunch. They had good live music and very good service. I ordered the eggs benny and bruschetta. The hollandaise sauce could have been more flavourful. Waiting for them to open the patio. You get a really nice view of the Dundas square."}
{"text":"Amazing crew.. great music to rock out to! Great large cocktails and good food.   The sampler platter for a appetizer is always a go to. Awesome ribs that will fell you up. Staff will always go out of their way to make a guest feel comfortable  and welcome. Birthday shout outs and rock n roll."}
{"text":"Catch a live show here for free while you enjoy some drinks!  The food here is mediocre. Typical bar Americana food. They haven't really progressed on their menu, so vegans beware. Wait staff is pretty friendly and they come out every so often to give you a song and dance. The one guy that stood up on the ramp railing was sooooo into it. He cracked us up. It was nice to see some enthusiasm about YMCA!  I love their live music offerings here. THE SHOWS ARE FREE! They have a nice sized staged in the back of the restaurant, which is appropriately placed so you can get a good view wherever you may be seated. Sound quality is fantastic. Props to you, sound man! I thought it was really awesome of them to offer a free show without a drink minimum. That alone will keep me coming back here. They didn't try and pressure us to order anything; we simple ordered some tea and appetizers and watched a really great acoustic set.   I actually love that this place is NOT on the Strip. Sorry, tourists. It's in a great location to bypass strip traffic, and has it's own parking lot separate from the casino, which is never incredibly packed.   Hard Rock...you rock! Keep the free music coming back and I will too!"}
{"text":"I'm always weary of these huge chain restaurants and their verbose menus, but it was the only option at the time and the experience fell flat.   I don't know how they caramelized the onions on my burger but it was impossible to finish eating. There was so much of it that the bad taste of the onions ruined the whole thing.   Twisted mac and cheese was sent back to the kitchen immediately after it was brought, the cheese was curdled and had a very repugnant taste.   Server was nice and apologetic but would not make me return to Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"Guy is a awesome server. He can relate to anyone he meets. We sat and Guy immediately came over to greet us. His knowledge of the menu and suggestions were on point. John ordered the passion Fruit MaiTai w/16pz Ribeye Steak Medium with Broccoli/ Mashed Potatoes. I ordered the Fruitapalooza w/ Tupelo Chicken Tenders. One Word...Yummmmmm  Great Atmospheric Reality...Eating & Rocking Out To Various Musicians.  They celebrated John with his very own Birthday Sundae. Awesome Feeling Good At 48"}
{"text":"This review was about to be two stars.  And then everything changed.  First off, if you like eating in the dark, with loud music blaring, and iconic pieces of pop-history bathed in a Leprechaun induced green glow, then you'll love this place.  It's the place for you!  I imagine it's the place you go to on a first date, because you don't have to talk to each other (in fact it's difficult to converse even across the small tables) and if there is an awkward pause, you can always look to the green, and say - hey...  Isn't that Rush band pretty awesome?!  Look it's a guitar!  And if that fails, just direct your date's attention to the music video and order shots.    So first dates - that's what this place is all about.  But I was clearly pegged as someone who is no longer a young spry buck on the lookout for love.  Maybe they also saw the wedding rings?  I don't know.  But if I wasn't on a date - there was only one other purpose for me being there: I was a tourist.  Now, let me tell you - it would have been AMAZING if I was a tourist.  The waitress came up and asked what brought me to Toronto.  I told her dinner.  I think she thought I was joking.  She asked what I was going to do after dinner, and I said my wife and I would probably go home.  Oh no!  she cried, there's so much to do in Toronto, and we really must experience it.  She rattled off a number of suggestions (and to be honest, they were all good.  They were things I would suggest - not just tourist traps things, but places with views, and interesting locations.  If I really wasn't just out for dinner, I'd have loved to have done some wandering.)  When she couldn't sell us on that, she told us about the movie theatre on the north west corner of YD Square.  She recommended some films she'd heard were good.  This was getting awkward - but we'd committed too far, and so we went along with it.  I guess at this point we were tourists in Toronto.  For the night, anyway.  The worst tourists, who don't seem to care about anything, but tourists.  Now - I wanted to complain about the cost of food.  A burger for 15 bucks?  An appetizer platter for almost 25?  But then I ate the apps, splitting them, and I was full - with burgers still to come.  And then I had the burgers - and they were surprisingly good.  I really didn't expect much - but there are worse burgers in this city that you pay just as much, or more for.    Sure I had to ask for my water to be refilled, but hey - maybe she wanted to give us country folk some time, uninterrupted, as clearly this was to be our only city experience.  But then the miraculous happened.  We paid for our dinner with a $50.00 gift card.  You'll note that our meal was more than that, even before taxes.   Two burgers, and the apps.  So I expect the bill, and to pay the rest.  When she comes back, she smiles at us, and tells us, \"the manager covered the rest of your bill.  Have a great night.\"  I tell you what, I tipped better than ever there had been tipping before - and I left forgetting the loud music, the shamrock lighting, and anything else that may have bothered me.  It was a truly delightful experience, and I'd head back."}
{"text":"It's Hard Rock, it is neither a stellar dining experience nor a bad one.  It was early but I was tired and wanted to keep it light, therefore dinner was salad based.  Note the the cook (or the chain): a handful of deli sliced chicken packed tight and thrown on the grill is not \"grilled chicken\".   Hard Rock...the decor is usually fun and so is the staff. It is what it is. And in this location, better than some of the other nearby options for lunch and dinner.  Props to the Business Manager for taking the time to read reviews and comment on each of them; clearly she is working to make Hard Rock the best experience she can for each guest within the rules she must follow (all business have rules that are not apparent to the customer)."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised at how good the dinner was. We ordered a variety of food and shared and everything was wonderful. The child portions are large. We ate out many times in Vegas and have to say this was our favorite. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our server was great. I truly recommend going to Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"Great location. That is about all the good I can give this place. I have been to a lot of HRCs all over the world and this is by far the worst one I've been too. Food was like warm, service was alright but the general experience was abysmal. Unfortunate as I am a HR member and get apparel from each HR I go too. If you are going for the apparel or atmosphere, you won't be disappointed, but if you are looking for a bite to eat, move on."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Can't say too much good about the place or anything bad about the place. Happy Hour really isn't a happy hour it's only a dollar off cocktail and draft. I ordered a burger my lady ordered the fajitas they were both okay. The workers were nice as well. The quality of food and drink you can get at a local chili restaurant for half the price. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody or down the idea of going back if a group of friends wanted to go.. It was the ultimate so so experience"}
{"text":"Hele leuke hardrock café vestiging! Oprecht vriendelijk en ervaren personeel. Het was druk dus of ik kon even wachten of ik mocht direct aan de bar. Dat laatste heb ik gedaan. Heel aardig personeel en mijn drankje en eten was in een no time klaar. Ik had de vegetarische flatbread. Een soort platte pizza. Het was echt heel erg lekker!  Ik mocht de refill gewoon meenemen in een plastic beker! Goed zeg! Wat een service en heel handig met deze hitte!  Binnen vind je uiteraard wat items van bekende sterren en er is ook een giftstore aanwezig"}
{"text":"I've been to a Hard Rock Cafe in just about every major city I've been to, which is A LOT. This Hard Rock is the Bee's Knees! Granted we got there at about 11am, right at opening and just in time for lunch, the place was already rockin. Elvis is alllll over that Hard Rock, should've known!  We had some great food, some nachos and burgers and some great drinks that hit the spot. We had an even better waitress, much better than at other HRCs I've been to.  As all other HRCs, the place was adorned with rock treasures from years past. There were flat screens everywhere showcasing music videos and performances. It's just an all around fun place to eat and hang out, gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Had brunch on the deck. Food was okay, not the best burger, but not bad. Bottomless bloodys were definitely bottomless. Good deal on those. Simple bloodys but decent flavor. There was a pretty good singer playing on the deck until noon. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good service nice place very roomy and clean is much more better the one and San Francisco. Also food service fast I will came back thank you"}
{"text":"Phoenix Suns Knicks game.  Bartender Carrie absolutely awful.. you cannot get a drink from her and she just sits and talks to whoever without serving a drink.. this was terrible..0 stars"}
{"text":"Top burger e negozio cool sotto!! Tappa obbligatoria. Rock 'n' roll!!!!! +++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"My daughter really wanted to have early dinner here, and I caved contrary to our plan to skip chain restaurants on this trip.  The decor is so fun, especially for a teen.  Music is loud, hard to talk but the videos are completely fun and distracting so there is little talking anyway.   Even though i set my expectations at a minimum they brought my chop salad out with blackened lettuce and avocado.  I had to find my waitress to tell her there was no way I would eat it that....and I no longer wanted anything raw from their kitchen. HOWEVER, the manager brought a new salad to my table that I declined at first, but it did look good and I was starving....and I did eat it and it was good  AND they comped it.  SO, service was great, but I wouldn' t go back simply because there are to many independent options that are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the staff at the Hard Rock Cafe in Phoenix.  Our serve went out of his way to make our experience the best possible.  We had requested that he take our picture at the table for posterity.  However, he did more than that by having us do different poses and had us do pictures all around the place.  The food was pretty typical corporate type restaurant food, but it was pretty good.  The beer was great and we had a very good time.  I tip my hat to the staff at this place and highly recommend that you get your picture taken there along with ordering some great food & drink. (We were there in September of 2014.)"}
{"text":"Amazing, enough, I had gone along with my immediate family a day after my 40th birthday since it falls on Easter and had lunch at Hard Rock Café Phoenix.  Always love HRC's atmosphere!  Our server's name was Angel and I can't thank him enough for being so kind, gracious and patient with my family. The entrees' were so filling that dessert was impossible to order.   Angel even went out of his way and took pictures afterwards by the Hard Rock Café logo.  We absolutely had a great experience visiting from Wisconsin on Spring Break vacation!  Thanks again for making it memorable for us."}
{"text":"Service was lackluster, I stood there for about 5 minutes without being acknowledged, I finally found a hostess and was directed to the bar for a take out order. Had a Cobb salad, it was OK, nothing special, although the portion was really generous. It was 10 bucks. It's close to the Sheraton, it's main selling point. Eh, it's OK, nothing great.  The bartender, I think her name was Erica, handled being hit on by a sort of creepy guy with great aplomb and diplomacy."}
{"text":"We love Hard Rocks but this one really pissed my husband off when they ignored his priority seating even though there were tables available. Our party of four had one drink and left. When we get back to our home HR we will tell the Mgr there how we were treated"}
{"text":"El happy hour es un verso. Pedí ron con coca y me lo trajeron con whiskey. Pedí gin tonic y me trajeron vino blanco. Música en vivo, valorable."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat at.  Large burgers with a hefty price - $12+.   Add $3 if you want to substitute onion rings, $2 more for caramelized onions.  They have barbecue ribs/pulled pork on the menu along with steaks.  Not sure if I would pay almost $25 for a steak here.    Thick Milk Shakes for $6.  Had a chocolate one tonight.  I wouldn't call it thick but it was decent.  They also have brownie sundaes and a few other deserts on the menu (all premium priced)."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Miss the complimentary shuttle to the other Hard Rock Cafe. The music was not loud."}
{"text":"This place was a ghost town on a Saturday afternoon. At least, it seemed like it to me. Any other Hard Rock I've been to, it's a wait for a table. It looked like the balcony/patio seating was pretty busy, though, I will definitely check that out the next time I go.  We sat at the high-tops in the bar area and ordered a round of drinks while perusing the menu. We were both pretty hungry, but debated splitting a plate after looking over the prices. Now, Hard Rock has always been a pretty pricey eatery, but I guess when in Vegas you think, \"I could get like, two drinks for the price of that hamburger.\" I ordered a bloody mary (gin) and my friend ordered a specialty drink that came in a souvenir glass. I knew before the check came that her drink would be at least $15.   And I was right. My well gin bloody mary was about $7 while her floofy tanning-lotion reminiscent bath water cost her double. Here's a tip: never assume the server is trying to get you to order what they like best, they are trying to UPSELL. They will want to sell you the most expensive thing on the menu.   Our server had a bit of an attitude when he messed up my bloody mary but hey, I used to be a server and I know I was within my rights. Fix it. I'm not drinking vodka. We left within about 20 minutes to find a cheaper place to eat.  One cool note, however, a manager was making rounds asking guests where they were from and taking msuic video requests. I requested Cinderella and my friend Journey and both were played prior to our departure. What a cool idea!  I would think that Hard Rock would be more.... Hard Rock. It seems like this place has gotten a little soft. Where's the rock'n'roll, the tattoos, the black hair, the leather and lace? Perhaps I need to come back at night, when the Disneyland families with their porkchop kids are safely tucked in to their beds at Circus Circus."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dessert after attending an event at the Talking Stick Arena. Very good service and very good food. This was exactly the sort of place we were looking for and I was so pleased. We will definitely return if we're in the area."}
{"text":"While staying at the Hard Rock hotel, my friends and i decided a trip here was necessary. Our waiter, John, was awesome! I split the Mac n cheese with my friend and it was super good. Having been to a couple of other Hard Rock Cafe's, I was a little disappointed with this one, it just didn't seem as extravagant."}
{"text":"Love this location.  I've never had a complaint about any Hard Rock, food is always good, beer is always cold.  This is in a great location of Vegas with a great view of the strip.  Bartenders are usually always cool too."}
{"text":"I came here for my Valentine's Day dinner. It's not a super romantic restaurant but we celebrated the day after Valentine's Day so it really didn't matter where we went.  My boyfriend wanted to try out this restaurant for the longest time and he smartly checked my Yelp reviews to see if I've previously been here. Unfortunately, I don't write a review for every restaurants I've gone to so he didn't know that I've been here twice before. The first time I went, the food was mediocre and I don't remember the service being stellar. The second time I went was just for desserts and I don't remember much from that experience except that I wasn't wowed by the restaurant.  This time, I had a great experience! We were seated near the entrance so it was cold and we asked to move tables. The waitress was more than willing to help us move tables. My boyfriend ordered The Big Cheese Burger (with three different types of cheese) that came with a side of fries and I got the Hickory-smokes pulled-pork sandwich which came with fries, coleslaw and beans. I'm pretty sure he enjoyed his burger because he finished it pretty quickly. I really enjoyed my pulled pork sandwich. The meat was tender and I liked the sauce that it was soaked in. I normally don't enjoy beans but I liked the beans that came with my meal. The portions are large too. I couldn't finish my fries, beans and coleslaw and my boyfriend was dying from his burger so he couldn't help me out.  Maybe they changed the restaurant up or something because I had a lovely experience recently at Hard Rock Cafe. It's across from the Eaton Centre so it's a good restaurant to go to after a day of shopping!"}
{"text":"We won't hear back in March for dinner when in Vegas decided to eat here trying to find another favorite place since Harley Davison café closed it was always our back up place to go because it always had good food anyway about the Hard Rock Cafe the food was OK nothing special just food place was clean staff was friendly a bit on the expensive and a little on the noisy side"}
{"text":"Probablly the smallest Hard Rock I have ever visted.  The food is pricey but good.  Service was great and nice atomosphere.  Great place for dinner before a show."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to figure out why but outdoor bar/lounge space seems to be in short supply in Vegas. Hard rock fills a void here- offers an outdoor patio on the second level right over the strip. Heaters were out when the weather cools. We didn't eat, just had some cocktails but really enjoyed the space."}
{"text":"Service was good, but food was so-so. The food was overly priced for quality. It's not bad, but not memorable either. Similar to an Applebees and not quite as good as Red Robin. It is definitely a fun place to try if you're in Vegas. The ambiance is fun and laid back, and it's an infamous joint. When in Vegas I guess..."}
{"text":"Simply put, it's a Hard Rock Cafe. Good quality food, cool decor and friendly staff. Beyond that it's like every other one. With the exception of different T-shirts, pins and other items in the gift shop. I will say that the fries were better than other HR Cafe's I've been to, except in Amsterdam. Those are hard to beat. I will say that the burger was very good. Super juicy meat patty though I wasn't thrilled with the bun."}
{"text":"Phoenix Hard Rock, Rocks it! Love going to this Hard Rock right before a game or a show in Downtown. Keep Rockin Phoenix"}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre food at best.  The reason I gave this two stars  is because you can buy cool shirts.  Who doesn't want a Hard Rock Cafe Phoenix shirt? ...heh.  I think the nostalgia has worn off on the Hard Rock Cafe after all these years.  It's no longer (not sure it ever has been) THE place to hang out at.    Two stars because it's still the Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being served by Alyssa and Ashley both ladies were extremely helpful. We got our food in no time! And the breakfast I ordered was AMAZING! If you go be sure to try the Tropical Pineapple Express! It's a little pricey but you are in Vegas. What isn't right?"}
{"text":"The night we went this place was PACKED with people probably from the fashion tradeshows but we still managed to have a good time. We checked out relics from Kurt Cobain, admired the circular bar, drank a few drinks, then cabbed it back to Mandalay Bay. Compared to the crappy Hard Rock I went to in LA, this place rocks."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for breakfast! Food is good & priced good. We got eggs Benedict slider and Belgian waffle. Three words: endless Bloody Mary! The patio is excellent for a quiet Vegas morning overlooking the strip & there's always live music. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Booked a reservation 2 weeks ago, and when we decided today to double check the time of our reservation they decided to cancel our reservation. The manager said they tried to get ahold of us but never got ahold of us, so they cancelled our reservation when they wrote down the wrong number. They also said they canceled our reservation since they had a group of 250 coming in. Now we have no reservation the day prior to graduation. NEVER GO HERE AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Hard Rock Cafe. The food was good - I had the Red, White & Bleu Burger which had some buffalo sauce and bleu cheese on it. I ate half of it and was fine. The french fries were very good. The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled. For dessert we had the begger bag (I think that is what it was called) - you know, the hot cookie and ice cream combo. It was very good! I don't venture inside many Hard Rocks, the only other one I can recall being in was in the Bahamas, but I don't have a reason to avoid it. It is a little higher priced for a burger than other places, but you are paying for the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Great Food and always a cool atmosphere! Drinks are a little on the sweet side but my burger was on point! Good place for family dining! Took a selfie with our waiter Andre, he was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Hi friends!  I came here with my girlfriend and another couple on our recent trip to Vegas. We stop by on our last day before getting back on the road.   Warning: the burgers are huge.  The citrus chicken salad was pretty good.   No drinks this time since we were still recovering from the previous night out.  Overall, nice place thats a bit more relaxed than the strip just a few blocks away.  Rock on! :)"}
{"text":"Not a very large Hard Rock Cafe but I always think hard rock has good consistent food and drinks.  Friendly staff. Don't know how you can go wrong.  Possibly could have long wait in busy days since a smaller cafe.  I have their rewards vip so always get first available seating though. And pays for itself for the small annual fee if you go to a hard rock few times a year"}
{"text":"Totally offended by this place. I'm 62 and I could not order a beer because I did not have my ID with me. I was told it was corporate policy. Not true; I was just at the Phoenix location and was not asked. This is LAS VEGAS!!!!!!!!    Are you kidding me? Walked out."}
{"text":"Great place! Tessie is the best server very nice and super personable really made our night a 10/10."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff clean bathroom very quick on food service. I love the view on the patio. I come here very often. The sodas are perfect and cold. Great drafted beers."}
{"text":"I know this place is known for music, but does it really have to be so loud? I have to practically yell across the table to talk with my friends and yell my order at the servers.   I can't even remember what I ate here the few times I went in the past year, obviously the food is not very memorable.   Honestly, if you've been to one Hard Rock cafe, you've been to every Hard Rock worldwide. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"HRC. No, not Hillary Rodham Clinton. Not Human Rights Campaign. Hard Rock Cafe!  I've been here on two occasions - once for the grand opening and again last weekend for the Motley Brews craft beer festival. I haven't had a chance to actually eat in the cafe yet, so this review is purely for the building as a venue.  It's actually a pretty impressive spot. The bottom floor is the gift shop. If you're a Hard Rock junkie, I'm sure you'll find something to take home with you. The second floor is where the actual cafe resides.  It has a nice size with a balcony that overlooks the strip. In the waiting area are Microsoft Surface tables where you can play around with music-related trivia and activities.  The third floor houses a small museum, a bar, and a stage area for small concerts. During the grand opening, I got to see Chris Cornell perform. This is also where the Motley Brews event occurred. It's a nice open space for these types of events. It also has a balcony overlooking the strip.  I think it's a little strange that we now have two Hard Rock Cafes and one Hotel in Vegas. I haven't been to the other cafe in about 17 years, but I can only imagine that this new one blows that one away. Then again, if you're a Hard Rock junkie (like a few people we met at the grand opening), you'll visit and appreciate both places.  Overall, this is a good addition to the strip."}
{"text":"Mom & I came to Vegas for a concert & stopped by for lunch.  The BEST service I've had in a very long time. The staff was singing & happy & a fun to watch  Service was fast attentive & the food was amazing! We've had Hard Rock in several cities & even in other countries and THIS was by far THE BEST Hard Rock out there.  The food was so good. Hard Rock food  is usually the same; so-so, you know what to expect. However I imagine this is what it's supposed to taste like. Prefect! Delicious!  Mom had the burger with jalapenos, New menu item. I had my usual bbq cheddar burger. We shared onion rings, perfectly crunchy & seasoned Our beers were really cold!   I think what made the food taste so great was the experience; the atmosphere the staff created.  Enjoyed every bite! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Hard Rock Cafe before. I was GREATLY disappointed. The merchandise in their \"museum\" was kinda cool but nothing to get too excited about.  The service was AWFUL. Just awful. We were seated in the middle of the room and while it was somewhat busy, we seemed to be sitting at the Invisible Table. It took forever to get menus or water. We sat and watched as all the other tables that were seated after us got service. Annoying. But we weren't angry yet.  A waitress from another table came by and asked if our waitress had helped us yet. We said no and she was nice enough to get things started (menus, water). Again it took forever to put our order in. They screwed it up--we asked for mayo and they never brought it. After waiting, I flagged down a bus boy and asked him.  The entire process took over an hour and a half. I finally flagged some random waiter down and asked for our bill.   While the food was pretty good, the service was so atrocious, I'd never return. It was a bad experience for my first time at a Hard Rock Cafe. LAME!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on going to Hard Rock like I use to be, but this location on Las Vegas Blvd has changed my mind.  At least, I plan on coming back to this location on my future trips to Vegas.  My husband and I enjoyed looking at all the music memorabilia.  They had some really cool stuff like art work done by Jim Morrison and one of P Diddy's suits to name a few.  This place has 3 floors like most of the places on this side of the Strip.  Downstairs-Gift Shop, Second floor-Restaurant/Outdoor Seating(view), and the Third floor-Club/Full Bar/Rock Stage(view).  See photos.  The bartender there was really nice and everyone there dressed like a rocker.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"It's not so much the food I come here for but the atmosphere. If you're a rocknroll fan, this place'd be like heaven on earth. They've got televisions surrounding the neon lighted bar blasting MTVs of bands from Beatles, to Queen to Maroon 5, celebrity memorabillia lining up the walls. I had a lot of fun checking out the original animated cell from the Beatles yellow submarine cartoon! Food and service was good, reasonably priced and comfortable. Everyone's really nice!"}
{"text":"I gave them 3 stars for the main reason our servers was too slow 3/4 of the time he spent away from us and he had no tables. He was busy flirting with another table that had single ladies and bearing everything. We were more conservator because we were couple up and not bearing nothing. I order the pulled pork sandwich and they brought me the Texas sandwich. I ask twice and both waiters reassure me it was the right one and then I was notified it wasn't normally any other place will come the food because it was their mistake they just shrug it off and made my experience not satisfying and regret  being there."}
{"text":"SHOUTOUT TO FRANCIS!  He was probably the most legit host ever.   We were asked to finish our yardsticks before we were seated, so he hung out with us before showing us to our table.  Being from Portland, we had to explain to him that the show \"Portlandia\" is based off of how Portland really is, versus just silly jokes.  And since Vegas is such a tourist spot, we totally dig being asked where we're from and the person that asked RELATING versus just saying, \"Cool\" or something else to the degree of \"we don't care, we're just paid to ask.\"  Anyways, he seriously made our night. He was geniunely friendly, and just such a fun way to start off the meal.  The food was spendy for being nothing all that special, so maybe if we were seated by anyone else, we wouldn't have enjoyed Hard Rock as much... But Francis was legit."}
{"text":"2 the food was meh (i had the appetizers combo) but the music was good. There was no line which was also a big perk. Apparently the pulled pork sandwich was good and the burgers looked really good as well. I wouldn't recommend the appetizers platter or the bbq platter though."}
{"text":"Yikes, the only great thing about this restaurant were the acoustics. The meal was meh and the service was terrible. Waited 45 minutes to get our food because they sent one of our meals to the wrong table. They said they were going to take care of one of the meals and when we got the bill they only took $5 off. Was not happy and asked to talk to the manager and they finally took a meal off our bill. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and it was excellent.  Service was really good and the all the staff were very pleasant."}
{"text":"We went to Hard Rock for a special event, brunch with Santa. The food was plain and the experience was non memorable. What was an issue was the parking, valet parking was non existent and the parking garage was difficult to find and even more difficult to get to the restaurant from the parking garage."}
{"text":"Bad idea to eat here. They burned the chicken and the bacon for my SANDWICH which come with bun. Not delicious !"}
{"text":"Shared a plate of ribs with some sides.  Ribs were really good.  The meat fell off the bone and had just enough bbq sauce.  I wasn't big on the sides as I'm not big on sides to begin with.  Had the nachos as an appetizer..eh.  The cheese was melted on the chips, but it was not warm at all.  When you ask for guacamole, I'd expect enough for a large plate of nachos.  Was that like a quarter size avocado?  Service was great.  Our server was on top of it with the drinks and upselling their rewards card and % off on merchandise etc.  That was fine, besides we talked about other stuff and she was pleasant.  It's kind of out of the way to come to this place, since it's off the strip.  If I happen to gamble at the casino there then I'd pay this place a visit again."}
{"text":"Headed in here after a job interview, offer, and acceptance nearby.  It was after 2pm on a weekday and the place was pretty barren.  However, I received stellar service, food, and drink.    I opted to celebrate with a mojito and it lived up to my expectations.  I then ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries, slaw, and beans.  Yum.  Loved every bite of all offerings.  Then, to top off my celebration and have evidence of the day, I stopped in the shop and purchased a sweatshirt with the Hard Rock logo on it.    I am satisfied with my experience and my efficient and friendly server and shop cashier.  Thank you for adding to my celebration!"}
{"text":"We are from buffalo New York. Went here for dessert and I'll tell you what, it was amazing! The apple cobbler was soooo good and the Oreo cheesecake was good also! I would definitely recommend stopping here for dinner or desserts. The food coming out of the kitchen looked fresh and amazing!  Aside from the awesome food the server was also great! Friendly and fun!  If you're in town go here!"}
{"text":"While I live/work abroad, visiting a Hard Rock Cafe throughout the world is a favorite thing to do. HRC -- Phoenix is a top choice of mine when I'm stateside. This establishment is ultra friendly, clean, safe and completely relaxing.  The customer care team (most especially the bar tenders) are wonderfully personable and professional.  Often I sit at the bar where conversations are pleasant and non-intrusive.  The food-drinks-service is tops in my book and I highly recommend a visit to HRC-Phoenix.    Thanks ! NC"}
{"text":"I absolutely love hard rock cafe...travis moe the bartender was amazing as well as  the manager steve Lazar made this the best experience ever. I will definitely come back again. Drinks ate awesome....all I have to say is...what does the fox say!!!??!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"The first thing you should know when visiting the Hard Rock Café in Las Vegas is that they are NOT associated with the Hard Rock Casino and that is a very good thing. If you have read my review of the Hard Rock Café in Universal City California you'll know I love the place, and the Vegas location is just as good, same great service and friendly employees. I have been to the San Diego, Hollywood, Universal City, and Las Vegas locations and it is consistently great which is unusual in a chain.  Now if you're a masochist you can just wander across the parking lot to the Hard Rock Casino (again no relation other than the name) they don't seem to want to take your money or even acknowledge you exist. So don't go to the casino stick with the café have a drink, talk music and look at the memorabilia."}
{"text":"On our last night in Vegas our group of 8 went here and had a great meal.    We ordered two of the jumbo combo's to start, then I and a few others on the table had the New York Strip Steak, both were a good size.  I have had much better steaks for less though, so I will mark it down slightly.  The service was very attentive and friendly, I hope they are like that no matter the group size.  The atmosphere was lively (which was a good point) due to the number of people in, and music videos playing."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Hard Rocks, and they're all the same and there's a certain fun charm to some of them. This one didn't have it. The servers were very interesting (my waitress was a McGill student from California, so we bonded over that) and the food was meh. I do enjoy their burgers, and that's what I always get, but the prices, the noise and the crowds all lead to a 2 in my book."}
{"text":"*RETAIL SHOP ONLY*  I'm a pinhead and I've only been to this location twice. I visited today to locate a specific pin and realized that I hadn't been here in 7+ years! Anyway, Las Vegas has a really great selection of pins that represent the city well, which is an important element for me when I choose pins for my collection.   The gentleman at the shop was fantastic. He brought the pins out of the case for easy viewing (you'd be surprised how few people offer this to you) and had a slew of knowledge regarding the pins I pointed out. He mentioned if they were limited edition, its background story, etc. He also asked if I was enrolled in the rewards program and it turns out I was not. I couldn't believe after multiple visits to different HRCs, no one asked me to enroll. Then, he informed me that they offer a locals discount of 15% (F&B and merchandise)! He was extremely thorough and offered a wonderful shopping experience. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I collect HRC Collector's Pins, so this review is based on the store only. We arrived around 10:30pm and the place was empty (I overheard that they had already stopped serving food, although the bar was still open for a couple more hours). The hostess came to the store area and was extremely friendly! She explained some of the pins and made sure that I saw all the options available. I found one for my collection and was pleased to find one honoring the Year of the Horse (on sale too!) for my brother. The transaction was quick and we were out in a just a few minutes. The location is conveniently located in Downtown Phoenix across the US Airways Center. There is street parking available. I'm not sure if there is a parking structure available."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday a little while ago. I ordered a watermelon Rita (Glorified margarita) and he ordered a pitcher for drinks, We had their Nachos with chicken as an appetizer and I must admit it was very good, lots of cheese! The waiter was very attentive as well which is nice. For mains he ordered a burger, and I had their chicken/ribs combo. My main came with coleslaw (Mushy), a cornbread muffin (STALE!!!) and fries (Crappy), The fries tasted like they came from wendy's and the ribs were AWFUL!!!! They were super tough, small and basically inedible, I gave them to my man. The chicken on the other hand was pretty good, especially compared to all the other crap on my plate. Also, nothing was cheap, Our bill came to about 120 dollars which isn't great, especially for meh food. Wouldn't return"}
{"text":"Diego Pomona (that's me) loves the Hard Rock Cafe's.....at least the one's I've been to!  I do agree with the reviews that say it's overpriced, because it kind of is....but you got to expect it.  It's downtown and it's the Hard Rock......ROCK ON!  The nachos are spectacularly delicious and the burgers are so big that they are hard to finish.  They have a cool drink selection and it's always fun to buy the cup as a souvenir...it also helps justify the price of the cocktails.    I've been here a few times and the waiters/waitresses have always been fun and prompt.  It's definately not as big as some of the HRC's that I've been to but they got some got stuff hanging on the walls if you want to walk around and burn off your nachos while you wait for your burger.   Rock over there!"}
{"text":"Food was waaayy too over priced, and the food itself was not great. Ordered the Hickory BBQ Bacon Burger and I would pick a burger from Jack Astors or Pickle Barrel any day. Service was terrible too, took us forever to get a waiter's attention for water/pop refill and the bill.  Go across the street in the Future Shop building, there are plenty of better restaurants for you to choose from."}
{"text":"I will not be back the service was very bad she took forever with are drinks and food and when we asked for napkins she took another 20 minutes just to bring is napkins the food was good but the service sucked and was bad"}
{"text":"I dropped by Saturday night for a date night with my boyfriend.  I come here quite often and the last time I came here was when I was a MEAT LOVER, so I have pretty much ordered everything off the menu and loved it. Now since I'm a vegetarian, I definitely have less to choose from.  So, we arrived and saw several booths empty. The hostess was quite rude and dry and when we asked for a booth (since there were quite a few to choose from) without hesitation, she insisted there definitely were no booths and I told her to double check because I saw several. She got slightly pissed off and another gentleman who was a host as well directed us to our booth and he was lovely.  Our server was awesome, and gave us some good tips on what to order. We had the bruschetta to start us off and honestly it was mouth-watering. Probably the best i've ever had.  My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich which ive tried a year or so ago and he loved it. My veggie leggie burger wasn't so great, I actualy barely ate it and am definitely NOT a fan, but the caesar salad was to die for! I really loved the dressing they used for it!  All in all, they should have better hostesses front of house, she really was rude and dampened our night a bit. And maybe work on the veggie burger, but we had a nice time :) And I guess I can't be too biased just because their veggie burger sucked lol. Typically, the food is awesome :)  1 star knocked off for the stupid hostess."}
{"text":"Loved the burger and Parmesan garlic fries. My hurricane drink was bomb. Love this place. Rock and Roll baby"}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch today. It was great! Chicken tenders with fries and ranch were perfect. I love love their Cobb salad. Our server was attentive and the best server we've had here in Vegas thus far. They have a great selection of non alcoholic drinks so I tried their strawberry-basil lemonade- it was fantastic. Great atsmospere. Thinking about having dinner there again tonight."}
{"text":"I finally got to try out the Hardrock cafe in downtown Phoenix. My first impression is that it's smaller then I thought it would be, but it's still pretty roomy the way the tables are spaced out. This is a great place to go if you are going to attend a concert or basketball game at the US Airways center (directly across the street) or Chase Field where the Diamondback's play. Overall, it has a pretty neat atmosphere with everything being music related. Lot's of guitars and gold records along with pictures cover most of the walls. be prepared, it is very loud in there. Music videos will be playing. This does not bother me, but you may have to raise your voice to be heard.  Now, onto he food. My wife and I had already eaten, so we ordered an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps. Nothing to complain about. Eveything was fresh and the layout of the food was appealing. Ordered and iced tea that was better then most places. We also had a great waiter...don't recall his name though. Prices are a little high, but it is geared towards being different and your probably paying  for that. I would go back again, but I would not just drive into Phoenix just to eat there on a whim. Maybe next time I go to a D'backs game or the Roger Waters concert in May."}
{"text":"This place is just... wow.  In a good way.  We walked upstairs, got seated right away at a table by the window.  Our waitress was awesome and friendly as hell.  Our drinks and food were the bomb diggity and the service was great.  Went downstairs to do some shopping after our lunch and were pleasantly surprised at the prices of the clothes.    I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They need Cornmeal to be on time because we are old (35,37) hardworking folks and want prompt entertainment....  Servers are friendly, Thanks Hannah for the laugh."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the Hard Rock Cafe. Food never changes and services is good.  Only reason for the four star review is because this place has sort of lost a bit of its swagger."}
{"text":"This place is in the perfect location. Downtown, right by the PHX Convention Center and Chase Field. I bet the vibe around gametime is insane here.  Came here for lunch one day while wandering around the Superbowl festivities. For how many people were in the city, and how busy it was, we were shocked to immediately be sat. The restaurant is laid out very well; pretty open, lots of tables, big bar, and small outdoor seating area out front.  Took a few minutes for our server to come by, but it was crazy busy so it's completely understandable. My family of three split a large Chicken Caesar Salad, and a Club Sandwich. More than enough food; large portions. There was SO much turkey on the club, we ended up taking a few pieces off and tossing them in our salad for some extra flavor! Just a tip, ask them to go easy on the salad dressing; it was a bit overwhelming as it dripped off my pieces of lettuce.  The server was friendly, made conversation with us, and was pretty quick. Sad face for his hat though - he was a Patriots fan! Boo! Go Hawks! :)  While waiting for your food, make sure you look around at all of the music memorabilia. I saw stuff from Kiss, David Bowie, and many more!"}
{"text":"I've always liked the atmosphere at the Cafe. It's fun to watch the music videos and sing along. This HR Cafe is usually pretty slow when I've gone, ever since they opened a second one on the strip. So if you don't want to deal with big crowds, I'd visit this location instead of the strip location. Service is and has always been fast and the staff is very friendly. The food is good, same as the other HR Cafés it's pretty standardized across the chain. The cocktails are good, averagely priced for the strip."}
{"text":"I love this location!!   Awesome strawberry lemonade with vodka (I think), delicious fish and chips, and touch screen TVs at your table so you can look at handwritten lyrics and choose the next song.  Great waiter, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff!  Good food! Great drinks!  We always go to a Hard Rock Cafe when we get the chance."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the drinks, 5 stars for the atmosphere,10 stars for our server, Michael! Math has never been my best subject, but I am going to say that's a solid 4.   Honestly, I normally wouldn't come to a chain in Vegas.... but this was the Yelp Spring Break headquarters and we were enticed by the $10 lunch menu for us. Since we were checking in here anyway, we decided to check it out.   - Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders - They were decent, but the bread/filling ratio was off and I thought the pork was much much too sweet. Still tasty though.  - Braised Short Rib Tacos - My favorite! Great combination of flavors, perfect short ribs, and the dipping sauces were a great match.  - Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos - We were warned they would be spicy, but they were overwhelmingly so! I loved the crispiness and the way they were loaded with cream cheese, but I can usually handle spicy and couldn't handle much more than a few bites of these.  - Twisted Mac and Cheese - This wasn't on the Yelp menu, but who can resist mac and cheese? This one was a little different, with buffalo sauce added (which I wouldn't have been able to tell, had we not been told). It gave it an extra interesting little kick, and the dish was creamy, cheesy, and gooey, they way it should be.   The dishes were more tapas style/samplers than the lunch specials advertised, but it was still cool to check out a place that none of us had been to. The free drink tickets from Yelp made it more than worthwhile too.... our Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktails were refreshing and strong.   Michael was personable, hilarious, and enthusiastic. He really wanted us to enjoy our whole experience there, and he was beyond great. He gave some great drink recommendations to my drinking-partner-and-crime and I: their version of a Long Island and another SoCo-based sweet drink. Both highly recommended.   Would I come back? Hard Rock was an excellent sponsor and host for our event, and a great atmosphere to get the party started. The fantastic service would bring me back, and also my discovery of the patio...... the front of the dining area is a huge, shaded patio with a view of the whole Strip and Bellagio fountains. Great place to grab some drinks and get into the Vegas spirit."}
{"text":"A fun but loud place to come and eat.  Music is good and loud.  Staff is extremely friendly.  Lots of cool memorabilia.  Love the TV's at the table to watch the music videos.  Food is good.  Might be a little over priced, but you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"LV Hard Rock was pretty. I loved the decor and ambiance. Seattle's newly acquired Hard Rock is nothing compared to LV's. We came just to hang out... no expectations really. Our waitress was really nice and had a good and appropriate sense of humor. She was very easy to chit-chat with and answered all my questions about Vegas.  We had some drinks, nachos and greek salad. All were solid. The bill was gut-wrenching though... $100+ for not a lot of stuff. But it was vacation and it's Vegas, so no biggie!"}
{"text":"Food was good,  but service bad. A customer shouldn't have to ask for silverware or water after they've already received their meal, and had nothing to eat with. Servers need to pay attention to detail."}
{"text":"Really good, love Hard Rock. I was there last week. I ate there everyday."}
{"text":"Nacho's..that was my mood....Burgers....the kids loved them...sat in a booth..enjoyed every minute....so many posts have kind of dissed the food...it is upscale bar fare and done quite well indeed...plus where else can you dine with Keith Moon's suede vest and Prince's ludicrus outfits and Buddy Holly's tiny dancer shoes...and 10 reasons why I love Nancy by Sid Vicious and gorgeous guitars galore....I love Rock and Roll and I loved the experience..have been to Hard Rock's in Los Angeles and Chicago, each is different but you can always count on a great burger, crunchy fries and an honest to goodness malted milk shake....MMMMMMMmmmmm.....the downstairs is weel worth a little tour as well...Elvis's guitar..one of...but very beautiful!!!!"}
{"text":"great food and great place! also theres a bartender named either shelly or sherri. shes amazing and sooo friendly! we always go and sit by bar just so we can have her as a waiter etc. the other employees are nice too but shes the best"}
{"text":"Came for T shirts and the staff at the shop were super nice and helpful :) the inside of the hotel/bar is actually really cute. I wasn't expecting it to be cute"}
{"text":"I am not about eating on the strip as it's always way over priced. This is on the strip and is no different. Food was very basic but super expensive. You're better off going downtown and getting a lot better food at a lot less price. The sandwich was cold and it was supposed to hot, the waitress must have had a long day as she sat down at our table to take our order."}
{"text":"I rarely go to a Hard Rock to eat. In fact the last time I actually ate in one was somewhere near Sherwood Forest, like Nottingham. (No, I am not making this up.) I think that location has since closed, so it is probably a good thing that I don't eat at these places.   No, I go for the t-shirts. Recently, I have been going just for the polo shirts and always as presents for the hubby. He has the same polo shirts from Hard Rock except from different cities: Miami, San Antonio, Helsinki, just to name a few in his extensive collection from my travels. Since his birthday is this month, I had to visit this store to pick up his present.   I almost hyperventilated when I saw \"the\" polo shirt was on sale. Sadly, his size was the only one sold out, but that didn't stop me. After all this is a tradition. Right next to the \"sale\" polos was the new model of basically the same shirt. Success!"}
{"text":"Need more bartenders but the over all experience was fun.  Went down for a concert/live band"}
{"text":"Three stars only because our server was nice.  The food was nothing to be excited aboutZ  Seriously!  Came here for world burger tour menu.  First of all they only feature 4 different burgers and each burger is like $20.  I ordered the Kimchi Burger and the finace ordered the Jambalaya burger.  The Kimchi burger failed to impress me.  It was described to have a bulgogi patty topped with kimchi.  The burger had no flavor.  The patty definitely did not taste anything like bulgogi.  It was bland.  The Jambalaya burger was was good.  The toppings made it good but again the patty was flavorless.  Overall I was not impressed with the food.... but Hard Rock Cafe management, thank your server Kyle for that extra star since it was his polite and attentive service that pushed my review up to three stars because the food WAS NOT $66.00 good."}
{"text":"It was quite the experience. My hubby and I went here before catching our flights back home and it wasn't busy, but there were quite a few people there. Walked into this place and it's a shopping area downstairs and there's an escalator that leads upstair to the restaurant and that's where we intended to go anyway. Right on top of the stairs, there was a guy there who took photos of anyone who goes to the restaurant. We got seated right away and because of our time crunch, we already knew what we wanted. I ordered a Grilled Alaskan Salmon and hubby got the Jumbo Combo. Both food was very good especially the mash potatoes that game with my dish. They made it with cheese or something similar. It was very cheesy. My husband's dish was huge or jumbo in this case. Service was great and the decor was very rocker chique. I will come back next time but not on such a time crunch. After getting the bill they give you a coupon to shop downstairs. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"My companion and I had a great time this late afternoon at Hard Rock. We were down at Station Square to check out the Nina & Pinta boats (which were cool.). We decided on Hard Rock because we could get burgers and eat outside.  The food tasted great, the service was just right, and eating outdoors at 5:30 or so was awesome. The fountain was in time with the music being played, there were just enough kids enjoying the fountain to make it enjoyable to watch them without it becoming distracting, the air temp was warm, the sky was clear . . . simply a fantastic way to conclude the day!"}
{"text":"Decent food and drinks for happy hour took my boyfriend it was his first time. The wall  screen touch wall wasnt working so that sucked also this Hardrock was bland nothing like the one in Los Angeles. Waitress was nice big bar but it just didnt feel like a music restaurant at this location"}
{"text":"We love visiting Hard Rock Cafe anytime we are near one. Great food, great service, and always a great vibe."}
{"text":"I am giving this location 5 stars because of the customer service.  Our 5 year old son is autistic and loves the band Kiss, he loves to eat at Hard Rock because of the Kiss memorabilia. The staff at Hard Rock is so amazing and friendly.  Our son runs to his favorite table where he has a clear view of the Kiss items and the staff never steers us to a different table.  The food is good too!  But knowing that we have a safe and inviting place to take our kids is the best feeling.  Thank you Hard Rock Pittsburgh for being autism friendly."}
{"text":"The waitress was really good and I liked the atmosphere but the meal was quite pricey. I wouldn't have minded if the food had tasted better but but me and my wife thought the taste of the food was average at best."}
{"text":"This is the worst Hard Rock I have ever been to.  The service is great, the food is great, the famous stuff isn't great.  If you're in the area and hungry for some good american food, go here.  if you're looking for that Hard Rock experience, take the extra hours and just go to California."}
{"text":"I went with several of my coworkers for dinner here and had a so so experience. We had to wait almost 30 minutes for a table to open up for us. There were 9 of us and they only had 1 table that could fit us even though it was half empty in there. I ordered the New York strip, medium doneness and it was dry and had no flavor. The only good thing was the waitress was nice and attentive to our needs. Other than that, this is a so so restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is very average there, but even worse are the bar tenders.  In an attempt to refer to the bartenders by name instead of \"hey you\" or \"thanks to you\" I was advised that \"we don't like to be called by name\". I was taken aback and thought they were joking at first but as the night wore on, their attitude and limited customer service skills were lacking.  I happened to be standing next to a local sports star when he was attempting to make eye contact so the bartender at least knew he was there and was rudely told that I will get to you.  In a service industry I was pretty shocked at their attitude and even more surprised at a name like Hard Rock, looks to me like you should be blessed to be patronizing their establishment.  With the entire entertainment down the street, you would think they are trying to compete for the spend, but thats not the case."}
{"text":"This goes out to Dana who was spot on while serving my family in the bar area, she is a great asset to your Team."}
{"text":"The best experience we had in Vegas! The waiter was knowledgeble about the menu. The hostess put us on the balcony during sunset, letting us view the strip at night. Amazing!! The manager came out and talked to us for a while, comping us free drinks. Highly reccomend anyone who enjoy's hard rock, going there!"}
{"text":"Date night with hubby before show at playhouse square. Easy walk from there. The food was great. The hostess seemed a little grumpy but not too bad. The server was the best we've had at any restaurant In a long time. I have dietary restrictions and she was able to quickly make suggestions  and make sure the food was correct. She was friendly and helpful. The food was great. Drinks were great. Over priced but you get a HRC glass. I haven't been here in over 10 years but am sad to see this place go especially after this wonderful visit."}
{"text":"6 of us walked in to have a beer.  Naturally went to the bar.  Tables were empty, so we asked if we could sit anywhere. Was answered with a yes.  Someone brought us over menus.  Then we were approached, and told we had to go to the front to be seated.  Again,all we wanted was a beer!! Got up and left.  If you don't want our business, then you don't get it.  Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Server took awhile to get around to us, or even get us menus. He never did get us silverware, and passed us off to another server with the excuse he was \"going home\"- even though we paid out and left whie he was still helping other tables. The service left something to be desired, but the food was good.  The main reason this gets 4 stars and not three was the friendly music manager (I want to say his name was Mike but it could have been Jason) that stopped to talk to us and gave us some great tips about heading down to check out Freemont street when we asked about what else to do in Vegas besides the strip and casinos."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly a crazy HRC person, but this place was fun & quite spectacularly thought out. The touch screen displays, the MSFT Surfaces, etc were all a nice touch. The place was huge. The food is like any other Hard Rock, although I'll admit the servers were just on the ball here. Pricing is like any other Strip chain, but I can imagine this place rocking out on a night with live music."}
{"text":"Dessert aye llegue. Este lugar supe que lo disfrutaría me encAnta todo la mesera una chica bastante amable y las bebidas súper grandes"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing customer service and food! Our server was very entertaining and made our visit worth it. The atmosphere and interior was pretty cool and since we bought a drink, we got to get the glass as a souvenir (you just show your receipt to the clerk at the gift shop downstairs ^^). I'll definitely come back whenever I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here to see a show, and decided to come early because we figured why not eat here if we are going here.  Turned out it was a good decision.  Ordered the lettuce wraps and nachos for appitizer.  Both were good, but the wraps should have had more chicken with it.  The nachos were great though.   For dinner i had some chicken which was delicious. Definatly cant complain about the food here.  Then the atmosphere for the show was also great."}
{"text":"This is the worst Hard Rock ever.  Our server did not know what the word means and had a hard time finding our table back.  We got the only thing we wanted, a t-shirt and will not be back."}
{"text":"I think I got lost and ended up in \"Soft Rock Lounge\".  Sure, the manufactured decorations are sleek, and the furniture is comfortable, but what do you really have to look forward to? A weak beer selection with the bar running out of the crafts? $14 burgers that don't look interesting? I guess it's cool to come here to say you've gone to one, but everyone I know says it's the worst they've been to in the US. I have nothing to compare it to just yet, but I should have listened.   Two stars because they have a groovy sound system and seem to support local artists. But I get that at a lot of places with good food/drink and no bums lurking outside the front door."}
{"text":"Great experience! There were 5 of us, we all weren't really hungry, but needed to cool down a little. We were sat at the table, our waiter greeted us right away, he was very helpful( that special beer he offered was beyond good). A little pricey, but hey, it's Vegas, you gotta spend money;) to top it off- we got to keep beer and cocktail glasses as souvenirs! Loved it!"}
{"text":"If you've been to one Hard Rock Café, you've been to them all, right? Wrong!  The Vegas Strip location is massive and beautiful inside.  The food is a bit spendy but is always good.  The restaurant is on the 2nd level of this 3-level venue.  The first level is mainly the merchandise store, and the third level is for events.  We came in for lunch and I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The dish comes out on a smoking sizzling hot plate.  Trust me, everyone in the place will \"ooh\" and \"ahhh\" as the server brings it to you, haha!  It's not the most amazing fajitas you will ever have, but it's pretty tasty.  My coworker got the twisted mac and cheese and chicken tupelos, which is a form chicken tenders but breaded with panko.  Both of these were so yummy!  Next time I go in, that's what I will have to stick to.  My company also had our holiday party at this venue on the 3rd floor.  The venue for events is absolutely perfect.  It's huge and either a band or DJ can fit on the stage.  The staff is super helpful, reliable and friendly.  We've never had any issues.    Definitely recommended for both food and for events."}
{"text":"We waited about 45 minutes to get in.  Have visited many Hard Rock Cafes over the years and have always left happy.  Today's meal was just okay.  I had the local legendary.  Tasted like a bland pierogie.  My husband had the schnitzel sandwich and said it was \"alright\".  My son would not eat the chicken tenders, which is normally his favorite food.  The service was great.  Heather, our server, was very quick to refill drinks and totally embarrassed my nephew for his birthday.  The food is rather pricey and could taste better for the cost."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Food was way overpriced and quality was eh. It was all frozen stuff that they are just reheating. They have a beautiful location on the river. I would think of the quality and price were to change they could really do some business. Guess that explains why there was only 1 table of people in there."}
{"text":"This hard rock cafe is the best one which i've evere visited. We got soutwest chicken flatbread as an appetizer and it was amazing! For main courses we got beef fajita and extra side order mac and cheese so everything was wonderful. Unfortunately I forgot to take picture of foods before we devoured it :) service was great too I'll definitely be back whenever i come to vegas..."}
{"text":"We came here for a Christmas dinner. The hostess told us we were seated in an area with the best waiter! What a joke! His name was Sean. If you get put in his area, ask to move immediately. He never came to check on us, never asked if we needed anything. We all had empty drinks hanging by the edge of the table and he kept walking by and never stopped. We told the manager and he did nothing. Finally, I decided to flag him down. He then proceeded to tell me to wait a minute and walked away. Never have I ever had such horrible service! What a disappointment!   The food was also disgusting! I asked to substitute vegetables. My dish came out with literally two pieces of broccoli. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Ich war schon in vielen Hard Rock Cafes, aber dies ist mit Abstand das schlechteste! Bereits zum zweiten Mal in folge war das Essen als es bei uns ankam kalt. Beim ersten Mal wurde die Bestellung falsch aufgenommenen und auf das richtige Essen mussten wir dann nochmal 30Min. warten. Die Qualität ist nur mässig und der Service einfach nur okay! Die Drinks werden nicht mit Liebe gemacht, darum schmecken sie auch nicht immer gleich! Massenabfertigung pur!  Zum Hard Rock allgemein, es gibt nur eine Vegetarische Hauptspeise, den Burger, sonst alles mit Fleisch. Und diesen leckeren Burger hat man vor zwei Jahren durch einen Blumenkohl/Ziegenkäse Burger ersetzt (in allen Hard Rocks) nun ist er absolut ungeniessbar, weil viel zu viel Ziegenkäse drin ist! Auch wenn man den Käse sonst mag!"}
{"text":"Yes, there are now TWO Hard Rock Cafes in Vegas. The original Paradise/Harmon location (which is in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino), and this one, which is on the Las Vegas Strip itself.   If you are not familiar with the Hard Rock Cafe chain of restaurants, you have clearly been living under a rock for the past few decades. Essentially, they combine great food and tons of awesome musical memorabilia and the like on display. These places are a music fan's dream come true.   The Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip is unique because it is set up in a 3-story arrangement. The first floor and main entrance is the gift shop. The second floor is the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant itself. And the third floor is a bar/concert venue.   As far as the concert venue goes, this place is excellent. I went in here for the first time the other night to see Dio Disciples, and the size of the venue is just right. It is intimate, but still manages to fit a ton of music fans. Plus the sound quality is excellent. You can stand by the stage, or go to the bar or a table/chair to sit down, so you'll be well off either way. There is even a balcony with a kick-ass view of the Strip exterior.  Most of my complaints with the place stem from the entrance/location/lines for shows/etc. Being on the Las Vegas Strip, just getting to the associated Showcase Mall parking garage can be a challenge (it costs $3 to park in this garage, but it is far and above your best option.) Finding the garage is tricky because the signs directing you there are so small and easy to miss. Likewise, to get into the show, we had to wait in a line, and the line actually went up a flight of stairs. Traversing stairs is fine, but being forced to wait on them in a crowd for long periods of time is not pleasant. Also, expect the full \"being carded/pat down/metal detector\" treatment.   But all things considered, once you find the parking garage and a show that you want to go to, or even if you're just wandering the Strip and want to shop and eat, this place is great. Definitely worth your time, whether you're a local or a tourist."}
{"text":"Good food, great memorabilia, but terrible parking. More on that later.  I decided to have dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe one night because I had one tickets to a concert at the Joint, inside the hotel/casino. As a fan of rock music, I'd been wanting to eat in this place for a long time.   The first thing I noticed upon arrival - shitty parking. There were HARDLY ANY SPACES, over half of which were blocked off for valet use only. I looked all around for a place to park - none whatsoever. The guy at the valet booth gave me directions to a garage, but I never found or saw it. The only garage I was able to find was for Hard Rock employees only. I finally had to park in a lot across the street. This story continues later in the review.   The restaurant itself is jam-packed with memorabilia. What Planet Hollywood is for movies, this place is for rock music. Memorabilia from every popular rock band you can possibly imagine is in here. Not to mention they sell plenty of items in their gift shop. It's a music lover's paradise.   The food was very good. Not the best cuisine I've had in the Vegas Valley, but it was certainly good. Definitely better than I would have expected for a restaurant like this that focuses more on its gimmick than its food, although my girlfriend's mashed potatoes did taste like they came out of a TV dinner. Other than that, all the food was fine.  Remember the parking situation I talked about before? It gets worse. When I returned to my car, I found a big \"violation\" tag on it, and a boot. I HAD TO PAY A $200 FINE TO HAVE IT REMOVED. In other words, I had to pay more money to have this thing removed than I would have paid if I had BOUGHT the concert tickets I had won. Why should I have to suffer because the Hard Rock can't provide adequate parking to its customers? Seriously and literally, I parked in the ONLY PLACE I COULD FIND, and was made to suffer for it.  And just a heads up - If you buy a souvenir glass in the restaurant, they WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE IT IN THE CONCERT VENUE. This is utter bullshit, considering it was merchandise from THEIR FACILITY, and it is a SITTING venue (this isn't a raucous \"standing room only\" venue!) So I had to walk all the way to the coat check booth to deposit it during the show.   The Hard Rock Cafe is a great place for music lovers, but do yourself a favor and take a cab there. The parking is THAT bad. And don't even think about parking across the street unless you want to pay a hefty fine."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich here that was a little on the pricy side, but huge!  It was also very delicious.  This is overall a fun place to be in, music playing, video screens, and of course, the famous celebrity costumes and tidbits.  Staff was quick to serve us, and also the bus staff was helpful whenever our server wasn't readily flagged down.  We were there for lunch on a Friday, and the place was lively and happening - helps that it was right along the strip."}
{"text":"(English below)  Mit dem Hard-Rock-Café kann man nicht viel falsch machen... Wir waren zum Frühstück da und es fiel zumindest mir sehr schwer, etwas herauszusuchen, bei dem ich nicht ins Zuckerkoma falle oder platze. Wenig gibt es nicht. Eine belgische Waffel mit Schlagsahne und Erdbeeren klingt lecker. Zum Kaffee. Aber nicht als erstes Mahl des Tages. Zumindest nicht für jemanden wie mich, der daheim in Deutschland gar nicht frühstückt. Ich entschied mich für ein Roggen-Sandwich mit dünnem Rindfleisch. Das war auch wahnsinnig lecker, die Hash Browns daneben waren für mich persönlich vollkommen überflüssig. Um uns kümmerten sich drei Kellnerinnen, die verblüffenderweise alle falsche Wimpern trugen und eine damit fast erschlugen. Trotz der noch frühen Tageszeit (ca. 9 Uhr, da schläft man in LV eigentlich noch seinen Rausch aus), hatten wir auf der Außenterrasse Livemusik, die Sängerin war klasse. Der Ausblick ist toll.  Nur wenn man abends vorbei geht, finde ich es nervig. Aus Boxen plärrt die Musik es gibt extra einen DJ. Nur den Tontechniker hätte man auch noch investieren sollen, da alles völlig übersteuert und verzerrt klingt. Dabei stehen dann Mädels, die wie Cheerleader angezogen sind und animieren einen lauthals, ins Cafe zu kommen. Der Anblick der Außenfassade ist zumindest von der anderen Seite des Strips bei Nacht imponierend. Warum drei Sterne? Weil es ein Hard Rock Cafe ist, dass es überall sonstwo auch gibt :)  There's not too much that can go wrong when choosing a Hard Rock Cafe. We had breakfast there and personally, I had difficulties finding something in the menu that would not catapult me into a diabetic coma or makes me explode all over the place. Small portions don't exist here. A Belgian waffle with whipped cream and strawberries sounds great - for an afternoon coffee. But not for the meal I begin my day with. At least for someone like me who always skips breakfast. I decided to take a rye sandwich with roast beef... It was really good, the hash browns as a side being completely unnecessary (I know, Americans luv it though). We had at least three waitresses caring for us, all of them astonishingly had false lashes which almost struck us dead :) Despite the early hour (about 9 am, you should usually sleep off your hangover in LV) we had live music on the balcony. The singer was awesome. The view is amazing. Only if you pass by at night, I think it's rather annoying. Loud music blares from speakers, there's even a DJ. Why on earth didn't they invest in a sound engineer as well? Everything sounds distorted and overloaded. Next to the DJ are girls dressed as cheerleaders trying to whine you into entering the cafe. The view from the other side of the Strip on the facade is impressive at night. Why there's only 3 stars? Because it's a Hard Roc Cafe that you can find anywhere else :)"}
{"text":"Had absolutely amazing service here! All staff was busy hustling and bustling but making jokes and wonderful suggestions!! Seriously the best service I've ever had. Ronnie was the COOLEST waitress I've ever had!! Jeff was a great funny host as well!! And the food was delicious, best Bloody Mary I've had!!"}
{"text":"Ooooo girl oooo not the choice to eat at today and never again in the future. So I was with a friend and knower this location was still open and around the corner from movie theater in which we were planning on going to after lunch. Missy was our server. She didn't really seem to care about my order and rushed me very quickly thru my very specific order. I do have dietary restrictions and those need to be requested not disrespected or ignored. I was in a pardy of 2 and asked to be seated outside. The furniture needs to be replaced cus it looks like the chairs are covered with bird poop. When ordering my cauliflower burger I specifically asked for everything on the side and raw. This means everything. Also when even asked for extra onions it was like a total inconvenience me god forbid that I asked what kind of fries it comes with. Just trying to communicate with her was a burden. The burger as pictured cam the way it did, and not together when trying to move it. When arrived the cheese was mysteriously melted and the look on my face was not good. If she cared at all she would have a nice it back before delivering food, but did not. I was disappointed and told running server who corrected the situation. When mentioned to Missy what was wrong she looked at me and said Oh good and walked away. My friend sitting across from me was dumbfounded at the odd answer.     The melted cheese looks so nasty like human waist and it was melted into burger, ripping the burger as pictured. I even mentioned I was not happy with the way the sandwich came out and told her the running is taking care of issue and got the odd answer. She's more like a truck driver and no customer service.    Fries were not gourmet and just steak fries with salt n pepper, don't wait your money"}
{"text":"The server is very Attentive, food was descent I got the salmon, salad with broccoli it was good , my friend got that Mac and cheese with bacon and avocado she said it was great but the chicken was little salty as she said and her strawberry lemonade looks good but she said it was too sweet .. Pretty much it's good! Love the place and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.. we ate breakfast and listen to acoustic guitar music played live with a wonderful singer. We had the blueberry ricotta pancake which was delicious. And we also had eggs sausage and potatoes. Portions were generous service was great music was wonderful"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a -0 Star I would.   First off, I ordered a Bloody Mary, it was warm, tasted like the devil's urine. I asked if it was good and obviously I said no and instead asked for a Michelada... who in the planet will get a Michelada wrong....!?! At that point I digress and decided wth I'll drink it... but what bothered me the most was the waitress reaction as if I insulted her most valuable creation ever!   I go to every single Hard Rock Cafe in Hawaii, Waikiki, Maui, Honolulu, Palm Springs, Los Angeles, and this never happened.   I always, always buy a sweater or hat or something as a souvenir, because of this waitress attitude I WILL never EVER go to the location I Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"We stopped in before a concert with limited time and didn't feel rushed.  Even though it was packed the server was quick, attentive and friendly.  Our food came out fast and piping hot.  Drink from bar were brought quickly.  We all ordered the chicken strips which were tasty and crunchy with a hint of spice from chili flakes.  Fries that we shared were perfect."}
{"text":"Bartender wAs super friendly. Forgot her name she had green in her hair. Food and drinks were quickly prepared. Need more options in your gift shop."}
{"text":"We went here for the \"steak and shrimp\" meal for $7.77 meal which is now $9.99. You get steak, mashed potatoes and broccoli three pieces of shrimp. The portions are decent this steak is definitely not top-quality, but yummy enough. They do offer a beer and a shot for $10. The glass of wine was a pretty good pour. Atmosphere was nice and service was quick."}
{"text":"By far the best Hard Rock experience I have ever had. The service was phenomenal. I had the smokehouse ribs and bbq chicken and they were great. My wife had the twisted mac and cheese. All together it was a great experience and we will return from time to time."}
{"text":"Even though our table was at a terrible location by the kitchen door, I hardly noticed. We had wonderful service and amazing food. I ordered nachos as an appetizer and my wife and I ate such a large portion that we almost couldn't touch our dinner. Of course we sucked it up and did our best, because the food was great. I can't wait to stop by again during our  next Cleveland trip."}
{"text":"My review will only consist of my recent trip to the bar top.  I've made plenty of trips to Vegas through my years but this was my 1st & 2nd time going to this Hard Rock Cafe within two days over this past weekend.  We had the pleasure of having some of the best bartenders Vegas has ever seen during our visit. We were greeted right away from the badazz himself, Kyle! What a great guy. A friend of ours wanted to by us a shot but did not know what to buy specifically. Kyle made a very unique suggestion which was a great one in my books. I have heard of this shot before in the past but never attempted to have it up until this past weekend. He suggested \"Dead Nazi's\". Yes, it's a real shot! After that great shot, we asked for another recommendation in which he was more than happy to do so. He suggested \"Sex with an alligator\" and yes, this is another true shot! Kyle had Woody set up this next shot with us which was a great addition to the very unique line of shots. Woody kicked A$$ as well and gave us some pointers about what we were having. These guys rock!  You may think I am making this all up but trust me I'm not. No one in Hollywood could make this up!  I apologize in advanced for not adding the blonde female bartender who I thought had an accent for some reason. She said she had a heavy tongue when it came to pronunciation. She was very dope and took care of us on day one of our visit. Rock on!!  The group and I will unquestionably be back to soon!"}
{"text":"This review is for the place as a venue.   I've been here before for a Yelp elite event and Motley Brews, but I caught a show ( ill.gates - church of bass) here recently.   This HRC is one level retail, second a restaurant and the third floor is a music venue. I  like that it's a decent sized but still intimate. There's a large patio if you want some air as well which has a nice view of the whole strip. I am a old crab and in the back by the bar is a raised area with seating. I can't do this whole standing and squashed onto people type business anymore so when there is seating, I am way more happy. Sound is pretty good in here but depends on the setup can get loud in a small space.   It was a fairly decent place for a beer fest, given that it wasn't too busy but this can be a clusterfuck if it was double the amount of people.   Overall, good non club venue for music.   (Yelp 100 Challenge 4/100)"}
{"text":"Located on Las Vegas Blvd in the heart of the strip and walking distance to numerous casinos and attractions, Hard Rock Café Las Vegas offers the ultimate dining and entertainment venue. Their hospitality is world-renowned, and is committed to the Las Vegas community. This Las Vegas location gives meaning to their \"Love All Serve All\" motto. As with all Hard Rock's, this location is packed with memorabilia from rock legends, and the restaurant offers fresh, house made entrees and signature drinks. This location is open very late, making it a perfect late night spot for gathering after a concert, festival, or sporting event in Las Vegas.   They have great events here - everything from Nirvana cover bands, Kickboxing, and fundraising events to XX entertainment. Hot tip: If you're a Nevada resident, bring your Nevada ID for no service fees on most events!"}
{"text":"Amazing interiors with huge collection from music industry combined with delicious food. Its legendary guys... Ambience is quite vibrant n since its located in the middle of busy downtown , one can enjoy the view from its glass windows. Hub for Ontario bikers n fancy car owners  I ordered a combo of chicken, ribs , beef meal which was tender n juicy. My cousin got steak which was well done n u can select ur side .  Wouldn't recommend cocktails here as they were too sweet but my cousin gives 5 star to the chilled beer. Infact sit n hav a drink at the bar where tv blare sports channel . Apparently the souvenir shop inside the restaurant has good collection of souvenirs from mugs , wine glasses , magnets , shirts to jackets . 40% off was a good deal at right time for me . The best things that happened to me was dinning here"}
{"text":"We made reservations for a big party for dinner after my daughter's wedding on April 2. All the staff from the girl at the Rock Shop that helped with the initial reservation to Michael and Ryan our servers and Tessie the wedding cake \"specialist\" made the evening extra special! Our food was excellent too! I would recommend the Hard Rock cafe for your wedding as well!"}
{"text":"I had only been to the Hard Rock Cafe in los angeles and honestly my experience wasnt the best, so when my friend wanted to eat here in vegas i was hesitant but decided to give it a try. So we walked in the store and up to the second level where we were greeted and taken a picture of that would later be offered for us to buy... They seated us quickly which was nice since the place looked pretty busy for a tuesday afternoon.  I tried not to get seduced just by the nice decor and the great music, but i couldnt help it, the music was great. Our waiter was a super cool/nice guy that came and sat with us as he took our order. My friend was hesitant as to what to order and he suggested The Texan sandwich, my friend loved it! I ordered the simple burger which was good, we got a LOT of fries as well, i couldnt finish my meal.  The place is not expensive, the food is decent, the waiters are helpful and fun, and the music just sets the whole ambiance, if you like rock that is. I can honestly say they changed my mind and i would come here again."}
{"text":"We stop here before every Mercury game. It's convenient to Talking Stick Arena and always great food. From burgers to delicious salmon salad, you can't go wrong. Decent selection of on tap beer. I would have given 5 stars, but service isn't always as quick as it could be. Plus last time they overcooked my burger and didn't offer to \"fix\" my order. That irked me, but it was still decent. I guess that's why I'm going back tonight!!!"}
{"text":"This still has great memorabilia and friendly staff, but I otherwise thought this Hard Rock was a shadow of others I've been to.  The restaurant is large, well-worn, and somewhat dingy.  The menu is large, but my meal was only 'okay' this time.  What most stood out to me on this visit was that, oddly for a rock-themed restaurant, there was no recognition of Prince's death on the day after he died!  No Prince music playing, no black bunting or anything on his memorabilia, etc.  This _very_ much surprised me.  I usually enjoy Hard Rocks, but this one leaves me wanting."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks beore the Suns game. Sat at the bar and were entertained by Louis and M.K.  They pour a great drink and are lots of fun.  Love when the bartenders are engaged with the customers even though the bar is full.   Fun time!"}
{"text":"Right across from US Airways Center in Downtown Phoenix. Nice place to go to if your in the area. Lot of signed stuff adorns the wall here, as is the case with all Hard Rock Cafe's. Nice bar, food and drinks get pricey however."}
{"text":"Patrick was a great bartender and Mandy was so helpful and gave amazing service at breakfast! The food was delicious and the drinks were perfect! The location was convenient for us as it was right across from our hotel! We had some bad experiences in Vegas, but the Hard Rock Cafe here never disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"A great Hard Rock to go to! Same fun merchandise that the chain has to offer."}
{"text":"This Hard Rock is not too bad but it is a bit confusing that this one is so close to the other one near the Skydome. Personally I liked the one at the Skydome better but there are plenty of memorabilia to look at and get those T-shirts that are almost iconic for some people. Still worth going to if you are into collecting these things."}
{"text":"This is a good Hard Rock since it is right by the Skydome...downtown. (I think it is what it is called). Same merchandise you come to expect from the chain."}
{"text":"The location of this Hard Rock restaurant is ok it is by a river and shopping area, not too bad on that front.Food and merchandise is the same as any other Hard Rock which is usually good. I guess my main beef is that I did not like Pittsburgh and the regional area people call the 'Rust Belt' of the country."}
{"text":"This Hard Rock was ok. That is being generous considering when I went to Phoenix it eventually became a trip from hell. Downtown Phoenix has no character and apparently the rest of the city does not have any either and that is very sad considering how big the city is. I think the only reason Hard Rock decided to put a cafe here is because the city is so big but nothing really great culturally. You don't here about the great music scene this town has so this cafe seems to stick out like a sore thumb in retiree central. Still it is nice to go something familiar and get the signature T-shirt."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't eat the decor since that is the most interesting part of this place, but why oh why do they hide the Stones memorabilia by their water station? Many would pilgrimage to see a Jagger silk scarf as he's definitely one of Rock's icons in the spirit of the restaurant he deserves to get just a little respect and we deserve to get some satisfaction.  Anyway, was glad to see they serve local beer so had some unique Papago Coconut which had an aroma so coconutty powerful I thought I was transported to the tropics and intended to stay there with my Mahi Fried Taco but nope, I was dropped back into the desert with a vengeance as there was a skimpy amt. of fish, nondescript flavor, and a hefty price of $16.95. Shared a Classic Wings appetizer for $11.95 which was flavorful, but at over a buck a wing, no deal. Also, they were somewhat rubbery instead of lightly crisped and then rolled in sauce. I'll be crossing the street back to Coach's for their flavorful dry rubbed wings next time I'm in area."}
{"text":"We are traveling through vegas on our way to California and stopes for brunch here. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was THE BEST eggs Benedict I've had in my life!  Fun atmosphere and enjoyed the live music. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Night before we ate here, great great service, best drinks in Vegas and yummy food! 2nd evening, still delicious drinks but DO NOT set near bar and be served by the bar waiter/waitress! If you EXPECT HORRIBLE service! When I have to continually flag down someone to get a drink k or replace our stall chips it's NOT going to make me leave a good review:("}
{"text":"The reviews for this Hard Rock seem pretty mixed. And I think I get why. If you go like my wife and I did for a tourist experience, this Hard Rock is pretty great. They have more memorabilia than some other Hard Rock's I've been in. And, because quite a bit of the mementos are along the stairs down to the basement dining area that mostly goes unused, you don't have to crane your neck over other diners to take a close look at anything.   If you're going to the Hard Rock as just a place to eat in Cleveland, I have a feeling you'll be disappointed. The food is pretty pricey for what it is and the restaurant is crowded in design. By that I mean that the dining area is so tightly packed with tables, it's almost impassable. Service was so/so. Our waitress was attentive and even comped us a free beer when the bartender mixed up my refill. However, I did see other servers who seemed pretty brusque and I can't remember much of anyone smiling. If congeniality is important to you, this might not be the place to go.  So if you're looking to see some awesome rock memorabilia (maybe before or after visiting the nearby Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), I think this is a great place to visit. The food is tasty and the walls are lined with great stuff. If you're just looking for somewhere to get a burger on your lunch break in downtown Cleveland, this might not be the place to go."}
{"text":"I have family visiting from out of town. He collects Hard Rock pins, and wanted to purchase one. We got there right as they opened, and they were setting up for a private party, which they told us would last for about three and a half hours. I would understand if the private party had started already - clearly somebody paid a lot of money to rent out the entire restaurant, so good on them. But since it hadn't started and all we wanted was to pop in and buy some merchandise, that seemed like something that could reasonably be accommodated. Instead, we basically got a condescending \"Yeah, no\" from the very disinterested employee who clearly didn't care at all. I certainly hope he turns on his positive attitude for the private party."}
{"text":"One of my teen son's favorite restaurants - wherever he stumbles upon one. We went here to the Vegas location after another great show.  While I suggested we eat before the show, he wanted to come here in the wee hours for the evening energy!  This time, we returned with 2 friends!  I was excited to find that for a limited time they offered menu items from tons of other HRC so I tried the burger that came with pineapple and spam.  It was SO delicious and juicy and the spam was a perfect accent, not overpowering!  My son got his usual pulled pork sandwich, and my daughter her usual child's chicken strips (in the electric guitar plate).  Our friends got a few appetizers and a salad.  While I didn't taste theirs, they looked and smelled amazing!  Our  Three Thumb Review is two and a half thumbs up!  I loved the opportunity to share the evening with friends in a big comfy booth (But I gave it 1/2 a thumb less because our water disappeared after our order was taken.  It was kinda busy that night, but still...). My teen son loved the consistently delicious food and rockin' atmosphere. My tween daughter still thinks that HRC has the best kids menu for eating and for playing with!  We're planning a return trip with even more friends by the end of the year. I'm sure this will be on the itinerary!  #ThreeThumbReviews #MakesMeWander #Vegas #RoadTrip #FamilyFun #Nightlife #RepeatVisit"}
{"text":"Great balcony to party on with a view of the Strip!  Full bar and concert stage. Rock music, open bar, free eats, and partying like a boss during a company event!  Store on bottom level with all kinds of Hard Rock merchandise. You have to leave down a staircase that exits through this store. It's like Disney World when you exit a ride. They lure you in to suck money from your wallets on all kinds of shirts and souvenir items.   It's near the World of Coca Cola and not anywhere near the Hard Rock Casino which does confuse people. It's right on the Strip. Was here recently for a client sponsored event. Tons of free food (bbq chicken, salads, mac & cheese, dessert station, etc) that were actually pretty tasty. Seems like the food is pretty decent here. Spacious stage area and concert floor. Cool memorabilia and posters on the walls. Large bar area with a nice selection of tap and canned/bottled beer.  I drank Dos Equis all night on the balcony overlooking the neon lights of the Strip and felt like The Most Interesting Man In The World!"}
{"text":"If you are going for the ambiance, it is worth it to relive you rock youth days. The staff is also insanely friendly and helpful.   The food... is forgettable. Tastes pretty much exactly like the food across the street at the 50s diner, greasy.   If you want to see how small madonna's outfits are, head inside, else, just walk on by."}
{"text":"The wait staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is very loud. We wandered in here on a whim and ordered the ribs and pulled pork sandwich. Loved the ribs and the red berry press was fantastic.  Unfortunately the sandwich was dry and wooden.    They did comp us half the meal. The location is ideal."}
{"text":"If you like a little hard rock with dinner, Hard Rock is the place to go! Generous portions of all American favorites plus new twists on old favorite cuisine with live concerts weekly make this a favorite spot for young and old alike! Creative drinks and specials make the menu affordable and interesting."}
{"text":"You won't catch me saying something bad about the Hard Rock Cafe, this is a business I make sure to go to Every time I can find one."}
{"text":"We had  absolutely  the BEST  bartender and waitress, both days we came. The  food was excellent! I would  recommend  this  place  for  anyone  over  21. The artist  of musicians  on  the  walls  were way cool.  Next  time  I  am in Vegas , I  will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Rib eye steak, Rack of Rib, Roasted Duck, Salmon, top off with fugde  sunday, Food and Service was Excellent !!!"}
{"text":"Very cool Hard Rock Cafe.  This one in particular has 3 different levels.   It has level  1) gift Shop 2) bar area 3) bar w/stage for performers   We came here to watch the kids from School of Rock perform and eat some good food while enjoying some drinks."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was great, nice people. Cafe was pretty cool.  They play music videos on their many flat screen TVs.  They have a bunch of memorabilias to look at.  Small store is also attached."}
{"text":"Man, was I prepared to give Hard Rock Cafe a middling review. I kept thinking of other theme restaurants like Planet Hollywood or Marvel Entertainment's and WWE's forays into this business and therefore didn't expect to give The HRC more than 3 stars.   Blame it on Y&T, who put on a stellar set here this evening, along with strong local bands Dofka and Icarus Witch. I would have never come here if it wasn't to see a show.   It's a good thing we came hungry or I would have never tried their food.   They should just call their Legendary 10 Oz. Burger a frickin' Slayer Burger, for it is the heaviest burger on Earth.   I turned it into a Nile by adding guac for an extra charge, and I didn't care because it damn near blew my head off with its quality.  Real Men Play On Ten...And Eat 10 Oz. Burgers.  Manowar reference. I'm guilty again.   It even came with this huge knife. Why? To kill it first?  Of course it also had lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar and that newfangled onion ring business on it along with mayo on the side.  Mayo + Guac on a Burger= RAWK!!!!  The fries it came with were as tight as Opeth's rhythm section.   I forgot to ask for ketchup, so I dipped my fries in the spare mayo and guac. I'm Aquarian like that.   The encore consisted of a Hot Fudge Brownie. If you read my reviews, you know how discerning I am about these things. They use Haagen-Dazs, which already impressed me. The hot fudge and brownie further exceeded my expectations as did the chocolate sprinkles.  What I wasn't prepared for was that heavenly whipped cream! It looked...different, as if it didn't come from an aerosol can. Upon tasting it, I knew I was eating the greatest whipped cream ever. It... whipped my ass.  I asked Alex, our most excellent and strapping dude of a server (does he double as bouncer?), about it, and he confirmed my suspicions. According to him, they use real heavy cream. In fact, he went on about everything else they make from scratch; our brownie was on that list.   You don't normally run into waiters at chain restaurants who are passionate and knowledgeable about good food. The man was proud of the cuisine he serves, and I appreciated him sharing that with us. Very, very cool.   You get the horns, brother. \m/   My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep. My girlfriend only got a cobb salad (generous portion though, and she couldn't finish it), and our bill was $42!!! But as Alex explained, this ain't pre-fabricated, frozen crap they're putting out, and they do everything up BIG like a KISS concert. Still, I can see how people would find the fare here to be somewhat overpriced. It's not like we ordered filet mignon, lobster, and Baked Alaska.   Anyways, enough about that. Scratch whipped cream, children, with real HEAVY cream yet. Local ice cream parlors, read and learn.   Now for the live musical experience.   The sound is terrific. There are even booths off to the side if you want to eat while you watch the show. My only gripe in terms of watching a concert here is that the venue itself is just a bit small and cramped. Despite that, we had a great, melodic hard rockin' time. This is a pretty nifty place to catch a gig with all that rock memorabilia decorating the walls. Just be prepared to let the moths out of yer wallet.   If RPM's in Bridgeville went upscale and became a franchise, you'd have The Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"Nice location near Chase Field.  Very quiet when we were there and despite that the service was mediocre.  The food was ok, nothing special.  Would not go there again as have been to many of these in different states that were really good."}
{"text":"Great place for food and desserts great atmosphere. If u are in Cleveland this is a must see place to go to see more Rock and Roll stuff"}
{"text":"We didn't eat here. They have a huge gift shop which is nearly rhe same size as their restaurant!  I had a shot glass from here from a previous trip with Dad and sis, so we just stopped into rhe gift shop to gwt a new  better shotglass! They have so many great souvenir choices! The associates are friendly and really helpful! We had out kids with us I was trying to look at the glasses and shirts etc, watch my kids at the sa.e time. It does feel a but crowded in there! But we got what I wanted and then we went walking on the strip some more! HOT! FUN!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a routine consumer experience at Hard Rock, so I can't comment on service, value or any of the of the important things you may want to know about. However, I have been to the 3rd floor on a couple of occasions for special events, and I dig the clean, modern space. Plus, the floor to ceiling windows provide a breathtaking Vegas view if views of Vegas are your thing. It's weird because the building is not tall, but somehow the size of the windows creates a panorama that is impressive in its own way. The staff has always been helpful, and today, I got to sample some of the appetizer fare served buffet style, perhaps not doing it justice, but it was okay. Still, I am a fan. I would recommend at least grabbing a drink here, although I am not sure if the 3rd floor is normally open. In that case, find someone with a budget and host a party here! It's a great venue."}
{"text":"I have visited a number of Hard Rocks across the country and I have to say, this location tries really hard to do a good job and their food is some of the best. The decor, general theme are cool but the wait staff are really nice and they try to have a lot of local bands in. If you have the chance to be taken care of by Zoo, Angel and some of the veteran staff there, you will have a great experience, learn a few things and leave happy. Some of my favorite dishes here are ANY of the burgers, Twisted Mac and Cheese, the smoked/grilled wings if they have them and their signature brownie dessert.   FYI - totally get your mixed drinks/beers in a souvenir glass. The big glasses are like 22oz and the refills are super cheap. It may seem expensive, but when you get down to it... I am a klutz and always need cool glasses to drink out of at home.  If I have to take a glass home, to get a cheaper drink.... I just need my arm pulled just a teensy bit."}
{"text":"Staff was great and we were served fairly quickly. The food however is a bit over priced for what it is and at the end when you are receiving your bill you are informed they don't take debit. They do however have a wonderful ATM you can get cash from which you get charged a service fee for using. Not a terrible experience but I can't say I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"As you can imagine if you've never been here, this place has an electric atmosphere with incredible memorabilia. The food and drinks are outstanding, excellent service, grand view of the strip from the terrace and some great artists for after dinner entertainment. A favorite of ours on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Had the salmon and a Caesar. Everything was great including our server Louis! Burgers are some of the best. Get stop before a DBack or Rattlers Game. The server Elaine was also 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have had mostly average or poor experiences at this establishment so I have not been back for many many years but earlier this week, my company hosted a private function in the party space on the second floor and I was impressed with the quality of the food (albeit only hors d'oeuvres).  The sliders were outstanding and the crab cakes were good too.  The servers were very friendly.  I can't speak to whether that quality of food and service upstairs is reflective of the downstairs restaurant but I thought I would mention it in case anyone is looking for a private function space."}
{"text":"Took forever to get acknowledge by the waiter and the manager Jason is a racist pos worst experience ever"}
{"text":"Bar service excellent when I went into place my take-out order, including giving me a 15% military discount.  Disappointed that gift shop didn't have any XXL classic city T-shirts.  Salad and dessert were excellent."}
{"text":"Love the decor, the waitress was so energetic and infectious I'm sorry I don't remember her name. The wings were really good we had the tangy sauce. Otherwise just a place to say you visited"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this H.R. location.  Will I go back?  probably not as there are so many options on the strip with better food.  The ambiance is outstanding, as is the sound system, but the quality of the food left quite a bit to be desired.  I visited with my wife.  She ordered a BBQ plate and I ordered the New York strip steak ($27.95).  While my wife's meal came out fine, mine was barely warm.  The mashed potatoes were cold and stiff, the gravy congealed and the green beans cold and hard.  I normally don't send food back because I've heard all of the horror stories, but I couldn't stand the thought of paying this much for a barely tolerable meal, so back it went.  I will say that the server and management were spot on though -- the server apparently notified the manager who came to my table to apologize and offered me a salad to keep me busy while waiting for a new meal.  When the 2nd meal arrived, it was much better.  The cut of beef was not quite as tender as I'd like for a N.Y. strip, but it had good flavor.  I just wish that there was an option for a baked potato rather than mashed potatoes, but alas - there were no baked potatoes to be found on the menu.  All in all, dinner came out to a little over $70 for two -- but the ambiance made up for what the food quality lacked.  You have to pay for parking too an it's not validated."}
{"text":"Convenient spot from Alexis Park Resort to walk over and get a decent breakfast. I had an eggs and sausage with home fries and wheat toast and my friend had the egg and spinach scramble. The food was good (especially the potatoes--they were like tater tots!) and service was nice but the menu was kind of limited. I enjoyed watching all the old 80s music videos on the wall monitors and was pleasantly surprised to discover their 20% off Yelp check in deal (food and non-alcoholic beverages only)!"}
{"text":"It's not my venue for gaming, but it's well worth seeing the incredible display dedicated to so many musicians.   It off The Strip and a hike in church shoes or heels, if you're a woman, so wear comfortable footwear.  The casino is huge and you could easily spend a couple of hours there.   If you're in Las Vegas for the first time or broke, it is a must visit!"}
{"text":"i was drunk when i ate there, but here's a review nonetheless...  minus one star because the hard rock serves pineapple in their joe perry's \"rock your world\" quesadilla appetizer...as in, there were pineapple pieces IN the quesadilla...as in, the quesadilla was sweet.  that is so messed up.  fruits of all varieties, please stay out of my meals!  except tomatoes.  tomatoes, you can stay.  oh, and you too, avocado.  i love you both.  so i gave my boyfriend a hard time (because he knows i hate fruit with my food and apparently \"pineapple\" and \"mango peach tango salsa\" didn't set off alarm bells in his head), he snapped at me, i got mad that he snapped at me, and as a result, there was no trip to pleasuretown that night...or the morning after.  hmph!  joe perry's \"rock your world\" quesadilla, thanks for ruining my life!  the HRC cheeseburger and fries were good in the traditional sense.  bottom line: good satisfying grub, but nothing to write home about...especially the kitschy Las Vegas theme.  BONUS: jakob dylan's autographed guitar hung on the wall right in front of my face (behind my boyfriend's head).  that was awesome."}
{"text":"1st visit when after the nfl experience, it was busy. Service was good,could have been better but with it being full understandable. Great environment music playing tvs with the music video. Food was great had ribs and pulled pork combo, came with fries. Two side one of beans and coleslaw,these are small dipping sauce container size. However was definitely full afterwards, no room for dessert."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here to grab a drink and possibly an appetizer before continuing on with our evening. It should have been a quick in-and-out, but it ended up being a long and disappointing visit. We've visited several Hard Rock Cafes in the past, and this one just did not live up to our expectations.   The drink I ordered was off their menu, so perhaps that was the problem. It was weak and way too sweet. When I told the bartender, they looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. Rather than debate it, I just kept it and moved on.  My husband ordered a flavored lemonade, and he said for the price it was super disappointing as well. Seems like just plain old Minute Maid with a few squirts of flavoring. Definitely not worth it.  I'm sure we'll keep frequenting Hard Rocks in our travels, but if we're in the Pittsburgh area again I don't anticipate making this one a priority."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this one. I really wanted to give it at least 3 stars but I just couldn't. The reason why I couldn't was because of the customer service. I swear they do not know how to treat customers. Every time I've been in here the servers have been so rude and just looked like they didn't want to deal with us. Our server today barely talked to us and when she did she was looking around at other tables. Two of us ordered their lunch special salad which we later found out that it came with soup. She didn't tell us it came with soup or what kind of soup it was.   The salad was ok, not bad for a lunch soup and salad. The soup was a potato soup, it would have been good if it was hot but it wasn't even warm. For a room temperature soup, average soup and crappy service, I don't know if I will be back. It's a shame that they aren't trying to do better since Houlihan's went out of business."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for an impromptu VDay dinner. We were in town for a hockey tournament.  My sweet husband knows how much I adore my metal bands- at least I used to many years ago- he can't stand it so I know it was true  love when the KISS tribute band took the stage.  Our kids were mortified. It was awesome.  Now to the food... If you like Moscow Mules you'd love the perfect storm.  We got the huge sampler platter to start. Onion rings were great  so were the tater skins. Chicken tenders were kind of meh- same for the bean roll ups.  Had the so Carolina sauce for my pulled chicken Sammie. It's tangy.  And really good and really messy. The guys liked their burgers.  Our waitress was a doll."}
{"text":"I ate here a while back and walked away full. We had overpriced salads and hamburgers that were large and filling and tasted decent. This place is great for tourists staying downtown or going to an event, but there are so many better, local places you could choose from. The martinis were $15 but you got to keep the glass, and they were not strong. The service was good, but all in all this is just another chain that charges high prices for low quality food. do yourself a favor and go someplace else."}
{"text":"I'm a huge music fan and anytime I'm in a new city I hit the Hard Rock if its an option."}
{"text":"Decent food but a little overpriced. The place itself was neat and had cool memorabilia. The location is ideal, too."}
{"text":"As a foreword, every time my wife and I go to a hard rock café, we are trying to find a match to the nachos we had at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe. We've been to a few, but yet, none have been able to stand up to those first original amazing nachos. So when we decided to drive up to Tahoe to go to the hard rock café there's only one thing on our minds, trying the nachos. When we got to the restaurant we checked out the menu and only found one, sadly, nacho option.  After discussing our dilemma with the waitress, she suggested that we add some shredded pork to our nacho order. We thought it over for about two seconds and decided that was a great idea. Our nachos came and they were great. Were they as great as though nachos we had in Las Vegas? No. But they were still really good and totally worth the drive.  you know, there is one sad aspect to this review, our waitress told us that in about six weeks the hard rock café found in Harrah's Lake Tahoe is going to be closing down. There are rumors that it's going to be moving over to the now Lake Tahoe hard rock hotel but even our waitress did not know if that was going to actually happen. So head up to the hard rock café while you still can. It has some pretty darn good nachos."}
{"text":"I came here before my flight home to have lunch. We had the sampler platter and margharite pizza. The service was great. The waitress we had was nice. However while eating we notice some food didn't taste as fresh but we were hungry and had a flight to catch. After we left we almost immediately felt sick. Our whole flight home we were throwing up and felt awful. I called the manager the next day to explain the issue but he was completely defensive saying no one else had that issue. Which is fine. But it takes only one mistake. One person not washing their hands or bad batch of food. Nonetheless he said he would contact me and never did. $70 down the drain and the attention to the matter was lackluster. Never again"}
{"text":"Can't remember the last time I was at a Hard Rock Cafe. This visit was only memorable for 1) Amanda Peachey's gorgeous face and voice 2) the jungle like humidity inside the place.  Our servers were attentive. Our drinks were frequently refilled. But it's just not as \"hard rock\" when it's so family friendly. It's a very small space, and being in downtown Phoenix on a Saturday night in summer, it was sparsely populated as well.   Maybe I'm missing the point, but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a pin whore and Hard Rock is on the my list of whore houses. I came here during Yelp Spring Break and I got a chance to do a little shopping on Sunday prior to leaving our hotel.  They still do take AAA discounts here which is a plus.  http://www.hardrock.com/locations/cafes/cafesAAA.aspx So I got my pin fix.  What was a little disappointing was they didn't have the shot glass that we wanted. Strange.  Always thought the shot glasses and T-shirts were their best sellers? Maybe not.  I also stopped upstairs to the cafe at 11am to try and use my Yelp drink ticket.  Going upstairs, the hostesses did not greet and it took a bit of time to find a server but I ended up talking to the bartender who, after asking, told me the tickets were invalid on Sunday. I guess that was my bad.  I don't know if I just came too early on the lack of service but hopefully it will be better next time I'm in town.   Oh, and oddly enough, there's no \"LAS VEGAS\" on the guitar outside of Hard Rock. So when taking a picture, you still can't really tell what city you're in."}
{"text":"When I passed by the Hard Rock Cafe on the strip in Vegas, I had to laugh. This place brings me back to the days in high school when it was so cool to be seen wearing a HRC t-shirt.  Of course, growing up in WNY, Orlando is the most popular place that families seem to vacation, .... so it seemed that almost everyone owned an Orlando HRC T-shirt. And boxer shorts. We were so cool.  But not my BFF. She scored a Las Vegas one, and I was secretly jealous.  Fifteen plus years later, and I had to have lunch here for memory's sake. The restaurant is rather large, and was pretty crowded for a late Saturday afternoon. A friend and I scored bar seats, and within a minute or two had the bartenders attention. The holiday drink menu looked intriguing, but when I asked his recommendation, he said he wasn't too impressed and could make me a fantastic raspberry martini, after a few questions as to what type of drinks I enjoyed. It was delish.  Our entrees (pulled pork and chix mac & cheese) were delivered rather quickly. Sizeable, yet manageable portions, and very tasty.  Overall a very positive experience. Enjoyed chatting with our bartender about the local MTB scene, and will have to return for another matini. Will probably not be purchasing any more T-shirts though. The coolness factor has worn off."}
{"text":"Excellent hamburgers, that's all I wanted to say.  Definitely some of the best burgers in Cleveland.  And it's Hard Rock, so the atmosphere is great with lots of rock paraphernalia and flat screen TVs to watch.  http://www.hardrock.com/Locations/cafes3/cafe.aspx?LocationID=45&MIBEnumID=3"}
{"text":"This place is refreshing compared to House of Blues. Relaxed staff, very helpful and friendly. And good food. HOB food has Always sucked. The load-in is no fun here at the Hard Rock Cafe. Up a flight of stairs, down a couple of hallways... The merch area is awesome! Overall, Hard Rock Cafe rules!"}
{"text":"Got to try their  Cauliflower burger and it was very good.  Definitely will try it again if the restaurant decided to keep in their menu.  Service was good.  Will come back for sure next time im in town."}
{"text":"Yes, 5 stars for Hard Rock Cafe.  Came in for brunch, they had live music and the guy was great.  They had bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's.  And they didn't shut it down or bring them slowly, they brought more before we were even finished.  Shane, our server was awesome!  Good was pretty good.  But the service and atmosphere was great, if you are on the strip, recommend brunch here!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed their wings!  Service good!  Located along the river and conveniently located close to Sheraton hotel."}
{"text":"Way past it's prime.  For the price of the food, better going elsewhere"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for good food and drinks with great people. The Super Nachos are too much for two people. Massive appetizer. Couldn't even have entries, all I had was nachos. Great music. Tons of cool rock and roll memorabilia. A must visit spot in Vegas.  Lucky Lance Williams, Master Sports Gambler"}
{"text":"My friends and I had lunch after the duck tour. The honey mustard chicken sandwich was very good. Burgers and chicken fingers were also very good. Mac and cheese sounded good but was disappointing. The cheese sauce was not thick enough and not cheesy enough.  I had the best mojotio at the Aruba Hard Rock Cafe on vacation. I was so looking forward to this drink and it was just ok. We sat outside and it was a beautiful view of the city. Service was good."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us and the café was not crowded, so the staff let us choose our table.  I ordered the shrimp dinner - it was wonderful.  Light breaded large shrimp and just enough, with the best citrus slaw ever.  Two of us had the Western, pulled pork sandwiches and they loved them, said they were a great choice.  My granddaughter had a cheeseburger and loved the fries.  I think the meal was a great value, and the food exceptional.  About the staff - they went out of their way to make us comfortable, explain the menu, and brought the food timely and hot.  They were attentive as well.  I would come there again and so would my friends.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"So I'm not sure if my opinion really counts here. I only tried two thing from the menu one was AWESOME and the other really not.  Maybe I was extremely hungry but those nachos were simply delish! The cheese was yummy, chips with a perfect crunch! LOL. Here comes the sad news, the shrimp that came with the fajitas were really good but the fajitas beside them self were super subpar.  I'd try it, maybe get a salad with shrimp and shake or something if theres a next time! :) The customer service was really nice though!"}
{"text":"The location of the Hard Rock in Pittsburgh is fantastic. I love sitting outside, looking out on the river, the city and the dancing fountain.   The food is the same as every Hard Rock across the country, but it's still good. It's nice to have the comfort of the same Mac 'n cheese or fajitas anywhere you are in the U.S.  The customer service is always spot on and the atmosphere is lots of fun!"}
{"text":"We came in after a flight into Las Vegas. The server spent a ton of energy trying to get us to fill out an online survey about her. She even went as far as to tell us what to write. It was an awkward moment  when she asked us if we had completed it yet to get our $5 off.   The food was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say more about the food then the staff. The meal was spoiled by the regular survey questions from our server."}
{"text":"I went with my friends from school. They order a salad.  I was yearning for junk food that day so I ordered a hamburger; I haven't tasted a better hamburger than \"El Corral\" in Miami and Colombia South America.  The bread was old but humid; there is nothing more distasteful than wet bread."}
{"text":"Sat down for a drink and a bite after checking in for Yelp Spring Break events.  The good: Charlie, our waiter, was very personable, and attentive.  The bad: The pork sliders (which were on special for Yelpers) consisted of a slice of pork tossed on a roll, with some sort of basil-sprout-looking things. They were Mohave-style-DRY.  The you-gotta-be-kidding-me: $6.30 for a pint of Sam Adams."}
{"text":"Tradional american food, the service was good Our waiter was very friendly, the food came out pretty quick.  They have a nice selection of cocktails, I had the strawberry basil mojito very good.  Sometimes they have live music there , theres a nice outside area to eat where you can enjoy the fountain.  Theres a gift shop in the front of the restaurant where you can shop all the hard rock mercandise."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  Came here for a little get together for my company over the weekend. We had a private room on the third floor as a get together and served buffet style!  GRUB *Tex-Mex Salad (okay) *Asian inspired Salad (pass) *Mash Potatoes (yum!) *Mac & Cheese (uber yum!) *Pulled Pork + Dinner Rolls (yum!) *BBQ Chicken (okay)  SERVICE + Awesome service from staff members! Thank you for tending to everyone's drink requests!  The facility was clean and the set up was quite nice. I wouldn't mind recommending a group party here if you're looking for a venue! It's on the strip and nearby the MGM!"}
{"text":"Live acoustic music during the day?  Heck yes.  On a weekday?  Horns up!    I'm a sucker for a Hard Rock Cafe so on every one of my travels, I make this a must visit.  I have been here on numerous occasions and I must admit this is one of my fave HRC's.  Patio seating with an entertaining view, good food, great LIVE music and on top of that, fabulous service.  We were seated right away during the busy brunch hour and our server Laura...well we fell in love with her warmth and charming personality.  All that justifies the cost of the meals.    Take a gander at all the great outfits worn by anyone of your favorite Rock Stars.  Rock music is a dying breed and its nice to see places like HRC pay tribute to the best of the best.  Don't forget to grab a souvenir or tee on the way out.  The styles are always changing and they totally scream Rock God (or Goddess)."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks. The bar and restaurant are on the second floor. They have an outdoor patio with an awesome strip view. Their mixed drinks were quite good. One thing that is +/- is that to exit you will have to pass through the gift shop. It's great if you are looking to get some souvenirs on your way out.Not so great if you are just going outside."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with the Hard Rock Cafe, as far as the service. My partner and I wanted to share dishes and our server was very accommodating, giving us extra tortillas for fajitas. The food was also prepared in a reasonable amount of time. The restaurant had a relaxing atmosphere. I did feel it was overly priced, there was a lack of variety on the menu and the tables were a little too small."}
{"text":"This place was dead at happy hour time - which I found surprising. I think with all of the great options in the city, why Hard Rock Cafe? And I agree. Although our food was all OK, my meal came room temperature and my beer was $6.50 (at happy hour!). I wouldn't return, but only because there are plenty of other great places to check out to settle for a chain like this."}
{"text":"I stopped at the Pittsburgh location just to purchase a t-shirt. It just happened to be trivia night and so we decided to stay. What else is there to do on a Tuesday evening when you are in town on a business trip? We had a great time. The theme was Jurassic Park. Apparently thus location does different themed trivia nights on a regular basis so check out their schedule.   If you frequent Hard Rock cafes, I would suggest signing up for the rewards program. I have received priority seating coupons in the past as well as discounts for merchandise and food.   We shared the jumbo combo appetizer: onion rings, wings, chicken tenders, bruschetta, and southwest spring rolls. It was a nice variety of small bites. But we didn't stop there. We also ordered the cauliflower wings, which tasted just like buffalo wings but with cauliflower. You get all the goodness AND it's healthier, right?!   Good times and good food."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten in a Hard Rock Cafe. We had tickets to see a band in their showroom upstairs, so we decided to grab some drinks and grub before the show. Staff was great, fun, and helpful. Music playing in the background is loud but not too loud. You can't help but sing along. Drinks are yummy but expensive but thats to be expected. Our food was average it was tasty but needed some tweeking. We got the Twisted Mac and Cheese and a side of French Fries. Love the mac and cheese and the garlic toast it came with, chicken was dry and plain. Fries were ok, could be crispier, most likely frozen. Friends got the chicken fingers and a salad, they looked good, and all the food was consumed without complaints. Now don't go to The Hard Rock Cafe for a terrific meal, it's more about the experience."}
{"text":"There are two hard rocks in Las Vegas! This one is the one with their casino and hotel! It is a bit older construction but it's nice with lots of \"Kiss\" memorabilia on display! Pretty cool"}

{"text":"The first pit stop  for Yelp spring break, I decided to eat here after registering.  My fiancee cashed in on her free cocktail, and we ordered the ten dollar specials. One was the Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders(3) with Tomatillo Jam, Micro Cilantro and the other was the Braised Short Rib Tacos(3) with Frenso & Corn Slaw, Cilantro Lime Aoili. Both sounded pretty good.  The cocktail was super weak. I get Asian glow easily and this cocktail did nothing to me. Maybe because it was free? As for the sliders, I actually did enjoy them, though the jam was a bit on the sweet side. We just used some of the guacamole from the taco dish and it made the sliders amazing, haha. As for the tacos, they're just standard tacos. Not bad at all, but not amazing.  Service was a bit too... perky for my tastes. Waitress was definitely nice, but I can only handle so much bubbliness. Probably awesome if you're bringing a family here, though, so not factoring it into my rating.  But mainly, Hard Rock Cafe gets 3 stars for 3 star food. Though I have no idea why a cafe about Rock was bumping Skrillex."}
{"text":"So I dined here the night before my departure and I'm a little disappointed I left it for last. My husband and I were so glad we were not disappointed! I had a steak with a shrimp skewer and garlic mash! It was so tasty and the steak was cooked well to its best perfection! Jesus was it so good! My husband had their signature burger and my picky eater states it was the best burger he ever had!  I didn't have any deserts here so I cannot rate that, but other than that, it was definitely the best place ever.  And our waitress Megan was superb  The only reason it was 4 stars for me was because I had to call their attention about an empty restaurant at 4PM and no waiters."}
{"text":"My friend asked if I wanted to meet here for dinner last week and after a game of 20 questions that involved me trying to figure why on earth I'd ever go there instead of the many options in the surrounding area that I like, I succumbed to his declaration of \"good food, and a good locals discount\".    Warily I agreed.   After arriving my friend seemed stunned by the prices and the lack of a locals discount or the specials he thought they had.   To this day I'm not sure if he made those up or was at a different place entirely that he was thinking of.   Never fear, the yelp app was here to save the day!   Check in and you get 20% off.   I love you Yelp app.    Started with some Jameson and Ginger and they were okay.   For $9 not much value, but I've definitely had worse.   Went with the \"Local Legendary\" burger which differs by location and oddly enough you have to ask the server what it consists of as the Hard Rock apparently is too cheap to have each location have their own menu.    Ours had some fried jalapenos and spicy something or other which was enough for me to try it.   I see someone else in these reviews mentioned their local legendary burger had a fried egg.  Mine did not.   I'm now convinced the \"Local Legendary\" burger is just something either the waiter or cook invents in their own head that day.   Well our waiter sold me on this one.   Speaking of which, our waiter was a joy the entire time.   Friendly, efficient, and with a great sense of humor.   If it wasn't for the last round of Jameson shots I'd probably be able to tell you his name.  He kinda reminded me of Questlove from the Roots if that helps.  Onto the burger:  Pretty run of the mill.   I ordered it medium and I feel like it came out well done.   Very charred and with very little pink inside.  Wish I'd gone with medium rare as I normally do, but then I hate when it comes out rare.   Such a delicate game the burger ordering process.   I also didn't feel it had enough seasoning to overcome the wellness of the cook on it, but the jalapenos, cheese, and whatever sauce it was slathered with all were tasty enough to conceal the meat flavor.   Fries were hot and crispy with a nice flavor, but nothing to really differentiate themselves from any other fry.     Overall on food I'd probably go a 2.5, with the great service and 20% yelp discount bumping it up to a 3.   I've come to find out through other reviews that the locals discount is a measly 15% vs the 20% yelp discount.   Go technology!   Next time I expect a 40% discount if paying by bitcoin."}
{"text":"I love the hard rock cafe and try to visit every time I come to vegas! My server was great!!she was very friendly and kept the mimosas coming!! We went for breakfast it was very filling and I will return again!!"}
{"text":"It's a pain in the ass to get to (as is everything on the strip) but it's worth the hike for locals cause this place has the coolest local bartenders and supports local music! Plus it's a great place to see a show cause, contrary to the convenience factor of getting there, its on the strip! Tip: park at Monte Carlo for free and walk over to avoid parking fees in the garage connected to it ;) And try the breakfast quesadilla, its magically delicious"}
{"text":"$70.00 for two burgers and two drinks is a bit much.  Not to mention, this place refuses to accommodate a large group even with long time reservations.  The manager insisted he needed to keep the tables turning due to events happening in the area although, I counted 3 other customers while we were there.  I love HRC in our travels and will always stop at one but this one has seen the last of me."}
{"text":"The food was average, but STILL GREAT!!  The atmosphere ROCKED!! No pun intended...okay. Okay, Pun Intended Indeed! I loved the decor and the autographs, and countless memorabilia that surrounded all of the interior of the restaurant. So much in comparison with Planet Hollywood, yet I still prefer PH! That's just me, and that's my style ;)  But the waitress we had, I forget her name, but she made the night extra fun! Great personality and so outgoing! If the food tasted like Shatola, then her performance would've made it worth the tips alone!  I'll be going back here when I return to LV!!  Check it out!! Rock on!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and music which is what I'd expect. Went on a Wednesday afternoon and there was only a couple other patrons. Our waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. We both ordered burgers which were cooked perfectly and very good. The prices are what you would expect at a Hard Rock Cafe. Ordered a Guinness which was poured correctly. Very nice experience."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast in the typical fun Hard Rock atmosphere. We had the back to Cali omelet, chicken and waffles and a bacon cheese and egg croissant. All were well prepared and excellent. Fresh fruit side was large and very tasty. Wait staff was perfect. Didn't know they offered breakfast but if you are looking for a really solid choice on the strip stop in."}
{"text":"Im in Phoenix for work and like to try local places, but gave in on my walk as I past the Hard Rock Cafe. It was around lunch time, 11ish and I decided to eat. It was pretty empty and a typical hard rock, but the selection was ok. I was craving a burger and got their burger. The night before, I was craving mac and cheese and when i saw it on the menu, I was so happy. I ordered a side. My server was great btw.   The burger was ok, nothing special. It wasnt very juicy, and they didnt provide much more than a piece of lettuce tomato and mustard and ketchup. Overall pretty boring and non-cravable. The mac and cheese, however was great. It had red pepers with a little kick.   It was a chain, been to one, you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Besides the awesome rock memorabilia the food was the best part of the experience. As nice as the food server was we didn't see her until 10 minutes AFTER we sat which made my bottomless mimosa bottom out......and when she did take my glass it took forever to get it back.  The toast was burnt but the omelette was perfect! Prices were average and I would probably come back on the understanding my bottomless drink should never be empty for longer than 2-3 minutes."}
{"text":"Starting off with a five !!  Server Matt fast and attentive !!! Really like being off the strip !!! 20% yelp discount...!!!  Matt finished strong never had to sit with empty glass !! Really good pulled pork sandwich !! The fam got the old stand by hamburger ...... great as always"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Hard Rock Cafes.  I don't really know why.  I collect guitar pins from them and have been to 30 or so in my life.  I don't always eat there, but I always go in and check it out.  The Phoenix one is one of the worst I've been to.  The old HRC on Camelback had a bit of personality.  I hated the location, but I loved how wide open it was.  Reminded me of the Honolulu one.  When they moved into downtown, I was excited to see them helping move downtown into the big time.  The location is great and it is a good place to grab a bite before a game.  The food is standard.  Never great, never bad.  Just across the board decent.  My problems with this HRC start with the layout.  The circular design is really bad for traffic flow, seating, wait staff movement, and sound.  This HRC lacks a true performance space which is terribly lame.  The bar is off to the side instead of being in the middle like almost every other HRC.  The shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame.  This HRC is always so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation with your group.    The other problem I have with this HRC stems from an incident where my wife and I went before a game.  She left her hat on the seat when we left and we remembered about 100 yards down the road.  Turned around, went back in, and told the hostess.  She said she would check and then she came back and said they didn't find anything.  I argued with her because we had JUST LEFT and finally went back to our table where it was still sitting in the bench.  Way to go idiot."}
{"text":"Post Suns Game location, Hard Rock is located right across the street from the Ball Park and Stadium, it has a celebrity theme setting. Typically not a fan of corporate type restaurants, and this is the reason why.  Food;  the Food is bar food and a bit over priced, the Potato Skins are standard to several location spots.  Service;  The server was friendly enough and ensured we had our beverages."}
{"text":"Five star rating is just for the cheese fries with garlic aioli.  Burgers - were good but not great.  The nacho appetizer dish was huge and tasted good.  What will bring me back are the fries."}
{"text":"Jason, Tex and the team are awesome. They treated me and my family great. Thank you for the personal attention and service."}
{"text":"Food and service is great but the AC is cranked high because \"the kitchen gets hot\". Get a separate system!"}
{"text":"Crappy bar service. Stand there for 15 minutes. The bartender nods to me. But then he sits and chills with the other bartender with the waitress and flirting while we are waiting on drinks. Finally a bartender comes back from the restroom and serves us as the same too bartenders are flirting and laughing with the waitress. Plus the one bartender was sitting there and joking, yet drinking. Maybe he was off the clock. But then get from behind the bar when many patrons were waiting to order and being ignored. Last time I visit this bar...."}
{"text":"I have been to HRCs all around the world, the atmosphere is essentially the same in all of them, so it comes down to service and the food. The server was stellar, she was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. I ordered the Triple Platinum Margarita and the Legendary Burger; the drink was perfect and the burger was hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great location on the river, ate outside on a beautiful evening. Great view of the Pittsburgh skyline across the river. You can seen the baseball and football stadium from here and there was. A Steelers game the night we visited.   Food was good with the usual hard rock menu. I got the Texan, which is pulled pork with several toppings. The local legend burger is a pierogi burger with potato, onions, and cheese.  Fun fountains set to music outside the hard rock patio. The whole area is an old steel foundry that's been redeveloped into restaurants."}
{"text":"Long lines before/after sporting events. Limited beer selection. Mediocre food. I wasn't impressed. I can't tell you how many times I thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area, only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like a rock star  you should make sure that you're lucky enough to get Amy to complete your Hard Rock Cafe experience while in Vegas.  Her personality was the olive in the martini.  The food did not disappoint either. I had the Haystack Chicken Salad with grilled chicken and my friend had the club sandwich, which was sizable and yummy. The salad was scrumptious and the dressing was perfectly mixed in.    The decor was classic Hard Rock Cafe and so was the experience!"}
{"text":"A bit attention to detail is needed a this Hard Rock location.  Hard working staff, but they might benefit from chilling out for a minute and soaking in some of that Hard Rock cool af aura that I've experienced at other Hard Rocks. Make me think that paying $18 for a chicken Cesar salad was totally worth it!  This location definitely did not convince me."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to eat here. I'm glad I finally made the effort. It is beautifully decorated and clean. All the staff was attentive and friendly.  When we walked in we were greeted and offered to have our picture taken with the Hard Rock backdrop, which we did. Seated immediately, and our waitress was there quickly to get our drink order and came back with them to take our order.  Everyone's food and drinks were fabulous. We had a very nice lunch and the price was well worth the food and excellent service!   I had the Avocado Salad, my niece has an avocado sandwich, my daughter and her boyfriend both had burgers. Again, all the food was delicious!  I recommend everyone put this place on your to do list the next time you go to Vegas. Enjoy all the memorabilia they have all over the walls, the music and videos they play that brings back memories and be sure to stop in their gift shop before you leave!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice. Definitely newer and cleaner than the other Hard Rock Cafe in Vegas. The food tasted good. The waitress Rachel was phenomenal. She was very attentive and making sure we were happy with the food and services. The host acknowledge the kids and talked with them. It seemed to have more choices on their menu compared to the other Hard Rock but not 100 percent on that."}
{"text":"When we went it was surprisingly slow. We went on a Monday night. Supposedly, their was suppose to be live music but none played. Their service was great, food tasted good and a very cool atomosphere. The reason for the 4 stars is their lack of food choices. Was not much on their menu, we had to flip through a few times to find something."}
{"text":"Service was slow at first, until a server from another section realized we were still waiting and came over to take our order.  She was very friendly and cheerful the whole time, in spite of being busy.  Food was ok, nothing I'm going to go back for.  Prices are high for what you get. The atmosphere and Rock & Roll memorabilia is all very cool, but we didn't have to eat there to see it."}
{"text":"We came here expecting something a little more chaotic and were pleasantly surprised by the live music and very relaxed atmosphere. The breakfast we had was on par. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of Travis' company as our bartender and server. Kudos to him, was the best service we've had here so far, he was super friendly and very helpful in offering some suggestions for us while we're here. Thanks Travis!"}
{"text":"We had our company holiday party here, on one of the upper floors, and I really enjoyed the space. We parked in a nearby garage so we didn't have to walk far- I was grateful for that.  The decor was dark and modern, with art on the walls.  Maybe a couple of hundred people attended, yet the space was comfortable - the temperature was never too hot or too cold, and I never felt it was crowded. It was easy to get to different areas, like the bar, dance floor and major seating areas. The covered balcony overlooking Las Vegas Blvd was a nice spot to see the bustling street, and floor to ceiling windows meant we didn't have to go outside to see the Strip.   The dance floor was pretty decent- great lighting and a stage for the DJ. I thought the sound system was pretty good.  I'd definitely come here again for a party!"}
{"text":"So before heading home to L.A. from Las Vegas, we decided to have some lunch here.  Seating was quick and easy, our waitress was okay, but not sure if the whole place was ready to go, and i heard they opened a few weeks before, not sure if it was true or not, but some of those waiters were not all there.  Anyhow, the salad alone took forever to get to our table, and it arrived two minutes before our meals arrived, which is not cool, we need to enjoy the salad atleast half way before our meal gets there.  Had their Twisted Mac,Chicken & Cheese, and i was not disappointed at all, good lunch.  Just like any Hard Rock Cafe, the feel and your surroundings are Cool.  Hope to stop in again once i am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"quick bite before any event happening at Chase or US Air arena. BBQ sandwich was ok and wifes burger was ok also. will probably be back when going to game at either venues."}
{"text":"I still cannot believe this place is closing. My friends and I started coming here in high school (over 16 years ago). We loved taking the rapid RTA and visiting Tower City for fabulous Hard Rock Café milkshakes. And the memorabilia! We're rock and roll junkies and swoon over the Beatles stained glass and Tom Hamilton (of Aerosmith) bass every time.   Tower City has lost it's allure so I understand why this location may not do so well, but couldn't they just move it near the Rock Hall? There's nothing at the water for Browns fan, Science center attendees to grab a good bite! I digress....  Old high school pals decided on one last visit, so here is my review. Fabulous. Our server was so sweet and provided excellent service to our group of 9. I ordered a grilled honey mustard chicken sandwich and it was perfectly prepared. Everyone agreed the food was terrific and although I didn't partake.... I heard the milkshake still lived up to the hype. It was a little pricey, but overall totally worth the experience.   Still bummed about the closure."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Kelay aka Kyle is the best server! He answered all of our questions and gave us suggestions on what to order. He kept our drinks full and he promptly brought whatever we asked for. We were completely happy with our service and experience! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice patio.  Totally mediocre and expensive food.  A tourist trap basically."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have been here twice. The first time was amazing with an amazing waiter named Terry, who did bar tricks for us and catered to our ever need, even to our friend who has trouble making decisions and embarrasses us! Only downside was the prices.  The second time? I don't think I will ever go back. We had a waitress named Amy, with a high pitched and shrill voice, who forgot our drinks numerous times.As well as trying to be a bit too friendly, stealing one of my prize stuffed animals to my side and saying I should watch better...very comforting to know that my stuff could be stolen from me as I eat. Yes, she was nice and ok as a waitress I guess...but once it came to the bill, it said \"We added an 18% optional tip for your convenience\". The tip was going to be 25 dollars...we decided 15 would be good enough.  As we left, she ran after us saying we \"were a bit shy\" from the amount due, We gladly pointed out that the tip was optional, but it seems Ms. Amy was NOT happy about it. \"I aim for 20%\" That's fine, but you didn't get it. She got mad and said she needed to talk to the manager before we left. This got us very angry, because she treated us like thieves or something.  She then came back 10 mins later saying \"We can go\". Well, if I would have known she'd be pissy about a tip I'd have taken the tip back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, indoor and outdoor seating, and good food, and surprisingly good place for kids all made hard rock cafe pittsburgh a nice place to eat for my family."}
{"text":"typical \"big box\" restaurant. food was okay. service was okay. music was TOO loud. there are alot better places to eat in walking distance. to sum up, wasnt bad but wasnt phenomenal either. id dine there again."}
{"text":"Kinda expensive, but was seriously the best service I have ever had at a restaurant! All the staff was great and our waiter, Toad, was exceptional! Burger, wings, and mac & cheese were all great."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  Everyone was so friendly and hilarious!  The food was incredible, probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. All of of really enjoyed the food and the music too. Great place to eat on the strip!"}
{"text":"If you've been to one HR you've been to them all. I was with a large party (30) and they were ready for us. Drinks came quick, food came quick, and adequate wait staff. There was a live band that we enjoyed listening to."}
{"text":"We all got food poisoning immediately after eating here! Poor service, poor food quality for outrageous price, homeless people out front begging for money. Would not recommend eating here, there are too many other places to waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"Was in town with my aunt who won a trip to Vegas and we had lunch here.  The staff and manager were over the top friendly and even had a tour of the facility.  Would definately recommend this spot for a bite to eat and for great service."}
{"text":"I have given this place way to many chances to impress me and every time I come out of there more and more disappointed.  We came here in early September before the concert and wanted to grab a snack. The dining area was not even packed. They did seat us down immediately and then crickets!! No one came up to greet us or even fill our glasses with water. We sat there very patient for over 20 minutes and nothing. How could you miss a party of 6? After trying to track down who our server was we left extremely upset on their customer service. I will not be returning back to this place. I have given it many chances and hoped it might make a positive turn. Sorry Hard Rock...You do not rock my world."}
{"text":"Best service and food ever! Every time I come to Vegas I HAVE to stop by here! And did I mention the CUSTOMER SERVICE?? IT WAS AWESOME!! Thanks Hard Rock!"}
{"text":"It's official, Pittsburgh has the smallest hard Rock Cafe in the entire chain. But, it's also got one of the best collection of memorabilia of any of them. I've been to many HRC all over the country and even though it's small I think ours is the nicest. The outdoor patio overlooking that great Pittsburgh skyline, the 60 foot black and gold Strat that sits proudly on top of the building, but what I want to know is, what moron traded the famous Studio 54 Sun that sat proudly inside the HRC since it's opening back the the NYC HRC? Silly move!   Anyway the food's gotten better, and they've added a decent veggie burger. Desserts are always a great thing at HRC. and who can pass up buying a famous pin at the gift shop, or proudly wearing a Hard Rock Pittsburgh T shirt when visiting an out of town HRC?"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting a Hard Rock Cafe. I shopped the gift store first and then made my way upstairs where I was promptly greeted and seated right away. My server, Sid, appeared right away and took my order. I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My drink, water, arrived quickly as did my food. She checked back with me and refilled my glass promptly. The food was excellent. The salmon was hot and flaky. The broccoli was steamed to perfection and the mashed potatoes were like homemade with an awesome flavor. I would recommend the cafe to anyone"}
{"text":"Out of all the times I've visited Vegas, I've never stepped foot into this HRC until now. Downstairs you have your memorabilia and upstairs you have the cafe/bar.  Came here with some friends. We were given comped drinks at the bar. Our bartenders were hilarious!!! They were interactive, personable and very courteous. Spacious and some seating you have the view of the strip. Fun to people watch.   Strong drinks and fun ambiance."}
{"text":"Order the Big Kabluna,  Jumbo Combo and Texan.  Best food and atmosphere on the strip."}
{"text":"- Pretty dead scene for a Friday night and there weren't many people around. Maybe it was too late for dinner? You may want to stick with the hotel. Everyone looked bored and ready for their shift to end.   - $15 for a sandwich? Really?   - Too cool to provide, you know, service. Our server never brought us our drinks. I had to track down another server and ask for them. We never even had the opportunity to order food because the service was so obnoxious.  + It looked clean and had some cool memorabilia."}
{"text":"First meal was outside overlooking the strip had bacon and eggs, over cook eggs, paper-thin greasy bacon deep fried country style potatoes no flavor overcooked. Although the view is great nice waitresses,  can't blame them for bad cooks. Had a wedding party with 13 people that night ordered a pulled pork sandwich the grossest thing I've ever had rates among the top 10 worst food dishes ever."}
{"text":"The food here is not good. The selection is very limited and what I got just was not good. The prices are kind of ridiculous for what you get. I haven't been back here in years. Maybe the food has gotten better I have no idea"}
{"text":"Excellent service the food was great our server Leilani really took care of us. Then we went into the gift shop I was going to buy an item they didn't have our size so they called the other store not have the size we wanted and had them hold it for us. My only problem with the store and the reason I gave them a four star was because the bathrooms were disgustingly smelly I can smell the urine before I walk into the restroom. I was surprised for such a clean store to have a smelly bathroom"}

{"text":"They bartender made a bomb Bloody Mary the female one not so much. The draft was frozen =0("}
{"text":"I was hesitant to coming to a theme restaurant for descent food but was presently surprised. The hazelnut French toast was amazing and the service was all around exceptional."}
{"text":"Had lunch here; in the words of my nephew, \"yucky wucky\". The ribs had NO seasoning on them and the beans weren't seasoned either. On top of that; I understand that it is the HARD ROCK cafe, but can you please turn the music down so the paying customers can at least hear themselves converse? We are still at a restaurant, not a rock concert. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Sat up in the bar area before a Dbacks game, service was excellent and food was great!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, cool memrobilia on the walls and pretty decent service usually.  However, their prices are awful.  WAY overpriced in my opinion.  $22 for a burger, fries and diet coke for lunch after tax and tip.  Seems like too much to me."}
{"text":"Were in town for the 4th. Came to check out food and drinks here and there awesome. But what really got me is the service our waiter ryne was the best. Thank you for the great food and awesome time. We will be back."}
{"text":"RAWK! This is my preferred stop when walking from US Bank tower to Chase Field for Diamondbacks game. It's a long walk and I get thirsty. Don't judge me. The burgers at lunch are great but what I like best is how cold they keep their beer. You're thinking, \"So the Hard Rock has cold beer, big whoop.\" Well think again, Sport. Undercooled (totally a word) draft beer is an epidemic, even more so during the summer months when cooling systems are working triple hard.   I've been in this Hard Rock dozens of times but I never tire of the memorabilia, especially the Prince homage that stares you in the mug right when you walk in the door. The only thing I do tire of is the stale loop of videos that play on the monitors. I'm a music snob and Taking Back Sunday clips bore the crap out of me.   The staff works really hard and can jive talk with the best of 'em. Stop in, say hello, and order a ice cold brew (if you're old enough... they'll check)."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical Hard Rock and is very touristy. It gets very crowded and can sometimes be hard to get a table,especially on the weekends. It's right by the warehouse district and Tower City so it's a good place to grab a bite to eat or even book a night in their hotel."}
{"text":"The salads, as always here are bountiful and delicious. However, I have to give this place a three out of five stars because when I got my receipt, the section on suggested gratuity was circled and the text was highlighted in purple. No other Hard Rock Cafe I've been to seemed to beg for tips like that. It was almost like the server was assuming I wasn't going to tip at all, which seemed odd to me."}
{"text":"I like the Hard Rock Cafe! I was going to the Neil Diamon 50th Tour and this is a great place to grab a bite. I had the Texan with southwest fries. The sandwich comes in two sizes and I ordered the small. I finished the pulled pork filling but left about four bites of the bread. I could not finish the fries. The fries were great, I was just full.  Also had two beers. Very good meal.  After the concert, I went back to by my Hard Rock Cafe to buy a Tee shirt. I enjoy collecting the Hard Rock Cafe Tee's with the location.  I will be back you can count on it."}
{"text":"Ordered my good to go. Got marry the bartender.  I m preggers and have been craving potato skins.. not only was she very sweet. But got my order perfect. No sour cream and extra blue cheese... thank u Mary... u r a life saver"}
{"text":"I like to go to a hard rock cafe in every city I visited, but this one made me disappointed. That was the smallest burger ever. It was delicious but It was small compare to what you are used to get in a hard rock cafe. Customer service was great.  My Hurricane cocktail was delivered in a small glass, I am used to get this drink in the regular hard rock glass. what happened?  Thumbs up for the oreo cheesecake, delicious and in a good portion."}
{"text":"This is a review for the 3rd floor venue, not the shop or restaurant.  I have been here a couple of times and it's great.  The 3rd floor hosts many concerts/shows and is very intimate.  If you don't like large venues, this is a great spot.  There is a large bar just as you enter, with plenty of seating and a large patio, overlooking the Strip.  The staff is friendly and prices aren't horrible.  My only knock is that this place is obviously marketed towards tourists, based on it's location alone.  They don't really have their own parking, so if you are a local and going to a show, you could park at the Showcase Theater garage, or across the street at Monte Carlo.  Even the MGM garage isn't too far of a walk, but none are particularly convenient.  Anyhow, I've seen a couple of shows on my radar, so hopefully I will stop in again soon."}
{"text":"We built this city on rock and roll!  Or did we? The hard rock cafe is definitely rock n roll.  I recently had dinner there, and stayed for a club that was being promoted by some hip hop dj's, which was on the 3rd floor.    The food at the hard rock is not bad.  By not bad I mean it taste like most chain restaurants, so stick to the salads and burgers, you don't want to venture out there too far.  The club was a beauty.  I loved the layout.  Nice bar.  Excellent outdoor patio overlooking the strip.  Clean restroom.  Plenty of space to dance.  I went Saturday Night, and the crowd was small for a Saturday, however, it was big enough to party and not feel like the place was empty.  I liked the idea of being in a club in Vegas with good music, yet not being cattled around like most clubs on the strip.  I believe with the right promotion this place could be one of the hottest spots on the strip for a club (especially since Poetry aka OPM is no longer open)."}
{"text":"We come here every year for a party and the service is always good. The food is good, too, but we always seem to order burgers. Haven't tried anything else. No complaints other than the price, but it's average for the heart of Toronto. Overall, always a good experience."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome if u can get any service what so ever to eat!  Been here 3 or 4 times to this location and the service here is the worst I think I have ever seen in such a long time. Each time a different problem has arisen and each time the management is worse then our server. This time was we had a portion of our food left on our plates. As we got up to mingle with friends I let our lovely server know we r not finished and we will be right back. We return to see the food taken away.  The server knows that's an issue so she gets the manager.  Instead of management going out of their way to please us, he argues that the plates were practically empty.  Way besides the point.  I asked that my food in which I paid for was not disturbed so regardless of what was left, how are u going to fix it... He then proceeded to think about how to fix it by talking w the server again.  I came up to their convo to say I'm not being picky or rude I would just like the rest of my 30$ steak.  They cooked us a less then worthy steak to replace it. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Came here last August because My friends and I were staying at the Hard Rock. Uhhh, Not much to say but their food is mediocre. Came in during Mid day. It was very dead so I cant say much about the atmosphere. Maybe it gets better at night who knows? Anyways,  I believe I had their Mac and Cheese and Buffalo wings? Oh and their coconut mojito? I forgot. But eh, I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe yesterday. We were seated quickly and our server Charity was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. We ordered the appetizer combo plate and everything was delicious! We especially liked the \"heavy metal\" wings and the killer bruscetta, and the onion rings were crisp and tasty. There were lots of good-looking items on the menu so we'll go again soon."}
{"text":"Thanks for lying about your hours... \"Sorry the kitchens closed\" well I wish that was posted somewhere so we didn't come all the way here from our hotel just to be turned down."}
{"text":"Review is for the RETAIL store.  My friend Karen has not been to Las Vegas for over three years, so I took her to the Hard Rock Cafe to check out the casino and the café.  There's 2 Hard Rock Cafe's in Las Vegas, one on the strip (but it's a franchise), and the original corporate one is this one off Paradise Rd, diagonally from the Hofbräuhaus. The café is not connected to the casino or hotel. Even the parking lot is not connected but has its own separate area.  Karen wanted a shot glass and the café had a bunch, including a limited-edition one. That's when we found out the café on the strip was not a corporate owned store. The one on the strip does not have the same merchandise as this location. Like all the other Hard Rock Cafe is, there's tons of music memorabilia post it all over the restaurant. When you walk in, you'll find Life-size mannequins of KISS.   The gift shop is pretty large, and the one guy who helped us was pretty friendly. He even signed up Karen for their frequent reward program.  Overall a good experience, except when you're at the parking lot, there's a lot of homeless people which gave me the creeps. The Hard Rock Cafe staff member said there's a water channel located nearby, and that's where the homeless people live."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, I came here twice. The first time, was where the club crawl bus tour departed from, the club crawl was awesome by the way. The second time, we came here for a Jeezy concert, standing room only, it was soooooo hot, Jeezy was 2 hours late, but the concert was awesome."}
{"text":"good place to get a salad and a burger. our waiter was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Typical chain that hosts national, regional and local acts. Large selection of beers and other alcohol available. Decent food menu. My office is in Station Square and Hard Rock is one of the places that offers discounts. Chicken salad is what I usually order when lunching there."}
{"text":"Finally went here on a recent trip to Vegas. Started off with some skins, they were good. Then my drink came, I can't remember the name of it but our waitress recommended it to me and I said what the hey I'll try it. It was amazing. I got the Local Legendary Burger, I'm going to put this out there for the whole yelp world to see. That was by far one of the best burgers I've had in my life. It was so light, yet so filling and cooked PERFECTLY. Your waitress was amazing. So sweet and so willing to suggest her favorites. The only thing I really can complain about is the price...but its Vegas...you expect that.  I can't wait to come back here and try something else out :-)"}
{"text":"Best casino experience.  Live music. Great food. This place rocks. I shot a couple photo's at midnight.  Of the infamous Giant guitar. With the full moon at the right of the body of the guitar.  Was a perfect welcoming mat to my checking in to the hotel. Seeing it."}
{"text":"Just a tip for those with kids:  watch the bill that you aren't charged for the kid's included drink, which will appear on your bill for $0.00 as well.  Three times we've eaten here, they've apologized for the 'mistake' each time."}
{"text":"There are few things I want in a restaurant. Red wine... And for my wine to come in a wine glass, not a plastic cup."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner. We both ordered the Guinness burgers as promoted by our waitress (who was very friendly).   The burgers themselves did not impress me much. We could barely see any bacon despite it being a bacon cheeseburger, and the supposed charm in this burger is its Guinness cheese sauce. I honestly thought the cheese had a bitter aftertaste which I was not personally a fan of. The fries were good, and I liked the Sriracha mayo that came with it.   Overall, it was a filling meal with good service. I think for what essentially looks and tastes like a basic burger, this place is way overpriced. Drinks are $10+ because you get to keep the glass afterwards (they give you a new one), but I still think that's ridiculous. If you didn't want the glass, are they still supposed to charge you $10+ for lemonade or a milkshake? There didn't seem to be an option presented to people who don't want to pay for the glass. Just order water."}
{"text":"I went for dinner the other night with girls for my bachelorette party and we had a blast!! The service was outstanding and the food was so good! It was the perfect place to start the night off right! :)"}
{"text":"This was my third time there before leaving my review. Each time they have been unable to cook a hamburger the way I order it. The first two times I just ate it because I was on a schedule and I'm not really one to send food back. But this third time, my husband and I got the wrong patties on the different burgers we ordered. He got my well done patty and I got his medium rare one. He decided he could live with mine, but asked the server to send mine back. While we waited for my burger the manager asked if everything was ok and we told him no, here's what happened. He never apologized, he just said \"oh, okay so someone is taking care of that.\". They also forgot the bacon that my husband added to his burger so while we waited for my new burger and his side of bacon, the rest of our food got cold. If I'm paying $50 for 2 hamburgers, it better be right. We have been to Hard Rock Cafes in different states and countries, but we will not be returning to Phoenix Hard Rock."}
{"text":"I can only talk to the merchandise store because I did not eat here. (I have been to HRCs at other locations and the food is normally the same and very consistently good.) the merchandise store was very nice and clean. The people working there were very helpful and friendly. They helped me find what I was looking for and even made some additional recommendations. I might be biased because I normally try to hit any Hard Rock Cafe that I cane find to collect my guitar pins, but they all seem to have such a fun and active vibe. I highly recommend stopping in if you are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Coolest Hard Rock I've ever seen, went to the surprisingly uncrowded bar on a Friday night, which was nice. Bartenders were really friendly, my margarita was extremely weak though :("}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, delicious cocktails. This restaurant is one of my favourites to visit in Vegas.  It's awesome seeing the costumes and random artifacts from celebrity's. The waitress we had was awesome and knew every drink on the menu."}
{"text":"I thought I updated this, but I guess I didn't so here it goes....  After my unfortunate experience, the manager messaged me and left me his contact information. When I contacted him, he apologized for the inconvenience and wanted more details. He explained that the waiter was new and promised to search for my receipt to review the charges. It took him about two days but he found my receipt  and issued me a partial refund for the items I was overcharged for.   There was nothing he could do about my experience while it happened, because he was unaware of the situation, but he did what he could to rectify the situation.   What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the food selection. I like the breakfast but I feel that the food is more catered towards experience than it is to feed you and fill you. Smart way to get you to order more but not really my style."}
{"text":"Depois de comer um belo Hambúrguer e tomar uma cerveja excelente (no meu caso um chopp IPA, na saída, ainda ganhei os copos dos chopp que eu bebi... Não podia ser melhor.  Ps.: com  dólar a mais de 4 qualquer coisa custa 100 reais mínimo."}
{"text":"Great location on the water. Im just suprised that on an event night they only had 3 bartenders. They had to fill bar orders as well as for the resturant. Felt bad because it was bad on management but the bartenders suffer. They worked as fast as they could. Also. They should have roped out a walk thru for the waitresses. It was so many people they couldnt get by with food and drinks. Music was good and I order a gin tonic and a soda and it was only $6.50. So honest prices"}
{"text":"It's the Las Vegas Strip.  You want some simple American bar food?  Hard Rock seems like a no brainer.  Unfortunately, the visit to this location was a very big disappointment. Granted, the establishment was setup well; the atmosphere is atypical and enjoyable but the service?!?  The service was ABHORRENT.  Our server was James.  Started well and then downhill.  And fast.  Slow is one thing but then it's the mistakes.  We're all human.  We make mistakes.  Own up to it.  But in James' style?  Yes, it's wrong.  \"What do you want me to do about it?\"  Hmmm?  Fix it?  And in a timely matter,  please!  This wasn't the case unfortunately and it left a very bad taste in our mouths.  Dear James, every party at our table is in the service industry.  We were extremely patient, cordial,  and willing to let things go.  It just got to the point where we couldn't take it anymore.    Dear James' Manager,  our server went to you for approvals on the multiple mistakes that were made.  It was on different occasions and they all took some time.  I would imagine that on the 3rd or 4th trip,  you'd think you should at least stop by and check on this party.  No luck there.  Sad hospitality,  sad visit."}
{"text":"We hosted a small party of about twenty people here on a Friday night in October 2010 and it was 100% perfect.  They have three party packages to choose from and they're all reasonably priced.  I booked everything via email and it was super easy.  They set us up on one side of the restaurant and seated the other diners on the opposite side, which was really nice.  The food was yummy, they let us hang out for as long as we wanted, and our servers were so awesome.  The memorabilia helped keep the conversations rolling and the atmosphere was perfect for a relaxed get-together for our friends and family."}
{"text":"I went here on my 31st birthday with my new boyfriend Dan. This trip was planned while I was in Iraq so it was super special. We didn't have a place planned to eat and it was not quite dinner time yet. With that said we got sat right away and had an amazing server. The food was also delicious. I had the fish and chips with teo long islands (birthday drinks) and I even got to take a souvenir glass and Dan had a burger. What is great about Las Vegas is if your not finished with your drink you can take it on the strip with you,  and that exactly what I did!   This Hard Rock really has the best Rock 'n' Roll Memorabilia! While we didnt check any out they have shows as well. If you in Vegas and any kind of a music fan, which I am sure you are, check out this Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Sunday. 6:20pm. Downtown following another amazing Mercury victory.  Hungry.  Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.  I've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.  One of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.    This time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary.   They have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.  But unfortunately - I can't."}
{"text":"The three cheese Burger is beyond the experience of any regular cheeseburger and let me say I have had many Cheeseburgers.  Enjoyed my lunch very much at the bar, watching music rock videos of all eras.  The service was very pleasant too.  They also have original Elvis' outfits for public view."}
{"text":"Great place to sober up in between trips to and from the bar. I have eaten here a great many times after embarrassing myself and others at Body English. This time we ordered 2 plates of the buffalo wings, which were some of the best I have ever had, and fries. Check totaled about $25, and the service was super fast and friendly. Totally low key and nothing to really rave about, but if you find yourself in the Hard Rock and need something to nosh on, and don't want to spend a fortune this is your place."}
{"text":"Before standing at the ready to greet and assist fellow Yelpers registering for Spring Break, I enjoyed my first lunch inside the Hard Rock Cafe on The Strip.  It has less rock memorabilia on its walls than the HRC adjacent to the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise, but is more elegant, plus features a dynamite second level patio overlooking other Strip properties, and a large third floor suitable for concerts.  But I was here to try the vaunted HRC hamburger, and was not let down by the 6 oz. Classic Burger with bacon and Cheddar Cheese added, and accompanying fries.  This was the small variety of burger, but it was large enough for me.    Although it took awhile to get made medium rare as ordered, once my sandwich arrived it was a fine burger.  Deconstructing its contents, it consisted of cold pickle chips, a good slice of ripe red tomato, green leafy lettuce, Red Onion circles, a warm charbroiled hamburger patty, a soft bready bun, very tasty bacon, and nicely melted orange Cheddar Cheese.  The fries were neither thin nor fat, and tasted just fine with the juicy Bacon Cheeseburger.  Service was friendly and professional.  It was an enjoyable lunch in a very cool setting, and I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"The Hard Rock Cafe continues to be a prime place for juicy and very tasty 1/2 pound burgers.  On my latest visit I enjoyed an excellent Original Legendary Burger ordered medium rare, with French Fries and fine crunchy but yielding O-rings.  This  bacon cheeseburger arrived with a moist beef patty cooked at just the right temperature, dripping with meat juices.  Potato Skins contained too much potato and from an ideal perspective not enough cheese, but were still good.    Our booth was quite comfortable in a setting of piped in rock music; service was very good; and acceptance of a Birthday BOGO coupon made the cost of dinner for 3 persons quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Our server was really friendly and patient. He made sure we got the best for our buck! Ask for him his name is Chris if you ever visit! The food was great and it came out really quick!"}
{"text":"They food here was good.  Service okay.. Maybe I had high expectations.. I left looking for more..."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here.  The first time would be four stars this time they missed the mark.  The pretzel bread is great and cheese very average.  I got a salad to go and it was marginal.  They gave me the wrong dressing and no fork.  The dressing was sparse not enough to use with the salad. The manager reached out and apologized and I will be in again."}
{"text":"Location ist toll Bedienung an der Bar war sehr unfreundlich. Obwohl happy hour war hat sie nicht darauf aufmerksam gemacht, sondern das teure Bier verkauft. Das ist inakzeptabel."}
{"text":"Went to Hard Rock Cafe for dinner tonight, food was ok but not great. Ended up not keeping it down...not eating here again"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Hardrock Cafes and this one was not all that great. The decoration and choice of displays were impeccable. Service was great until we got our food. Just a little while to wait on a slow day with plenty of staff. I had the classic nachos with is a great vegetarian choice. My boyfriend bit into a bone in his pulled pork sandwich and it wasn't very small. A bayleaf was also left on his sandwich. Kitchen staff needs to pay a little more attention to their food."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to eat a burger. Before finishing our meal the waiter brought the bill and insistently asked if we had finished, even if it was clear we were still eating.  Poor price for value. Extremely bad service."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I wanted to eat before we went to the airport (as opposed to eating airport food - bleh!). Someone suggested this place, so we went for it.   Appetizers:   Jumbo Combo - Get it. It was pretty good as far as appetizer combos go. Spring Rolls (my fave), Chicken Wings, Onion Rings, Potato Skins and Chicken Tenders. Plenty of dipping sauces.   Main Course:  California Chicken Club Sandwich - wasn't bad! I don't remember finishing it, so I guess it was just OK.   Drinks:  I can't remember the drink. Possibly lemonade. However, the server gave me the option to upgrade with a souvenir HRC logo tall glass! I went for it! Love the glass (just used it today).   Service:   Seemed fine until she dropped a ramekin of jalapenos behind my chair. Had jalapeno juice on my shoe, pants and jacket! She said sorry, but that kinda sucked.   Bathroom:   Clean. A little dark, but clean (at least the areas I could see - LOL).   Atmosphere:   Just like every other HRC in the U.S. Nothing new.  Next time, we'll skip this chain and just ask the locals where's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I do not understand why the Hard Rock Cafe (HRC) is an oft-used venue for bachelorette and birthday parties. WHY? Every single time I go to Hard Rock, there is at least one overdressed table of ladies with phallic hats and party favors wearing buttons that say something like \"team bride.\" As a side note, ladies... just stop it with this crap.  You're not being creative, you're not funny.  Step outside of the bride-to-be box.   That being said, in order to actually get a table at HRC you must wait.  Often long times, too because aforementioned parties take up a great deal of space in HRC's small dining room.    The food is decent but boring.  I've enjoyed their twisted mac n' cheese and large salads. The specialty drinks are way overpriced and have contain little alcohol.  I don't mind expensive cocktails if they pack a bang for your buck (see: Acacia). But HRC favorites like the \"Mosh Pit\" (gin, citron vodka, basil, strawberries) tasted like pureed strawberries and nothing else.  I reluctantly sent it back and swapped it for a beer.   As with most HRCs, they have bands play on weekend nights.  Be aware, if you come for a late dinner then be prepared to either (1) eat quickly or (2) pay the ticket price for seeing the show.  This is all well and good but if you have a party that has waited over an hour to be seated only to be rushed out the door, there is no chance in actually enjoying yourself.    I was prepared to give HRC one star.  Why the two?  Because despite the tourist-trap prices, the long wait times, and overpriced drinks, the Hard Rock hires some very patient and friendly staff. They're really great. So there's that.    Unfortunately the nice waiters aren't enough for me to ever go there on my own volition. You will only catch me there if I'm at a friend's birthday party.  And I am so stealing a few bites of his or her free sundae."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT...  Our son is a Hard Rock Café groupie, if there is one in the city he is visiting, you can be sure that he will check it out.  While visiting Cleveland with him and his beautiful wife, my husband and I joined them here for lunch.  The service was friendly and efficient, the set-up was, as always, with Hard Rock, very interesting and on point.  The food, which is why, of course we came, was Outstanding.  The Salad that my daughter-in-law ordered was plentiful, fresh and delicious.  The burgers that we had were perfectly cooked, juicy and oh so yummy and the French fries were heaven, deliciously seasoned and steaming hot.  My husbands wings were prepared just the way he ordered them and they were perfect.  The drinks were pretty awesome as well, one of the best classic Margarita's I've had in a long time... Kudo's to the bartender."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese was wondeful!! The staff is fun and we had great service. We even received a glass to take home."}
{"text":"Breakfast is delicious, beware when they hand you \"complimentary dough bites with strawberry sauce\".  They're beyond stale and nasty.  Would go back for their food and service!"}
{"text":"This Hard Rock is really nothing special. It is much smaller than most of them and doesn't have any really spectacular memorabilia in it. Still, it is a good place to get souvenirs that say Phoenix and very convenient to downtown sporting events. Food and service are OK."}
{"text":"My friend and I were celebrating my birthday and decided to see Aaron Carter since we had both seen him as children. We paid $20 each at the door to stand for almost 2 hours waiting to see him. The tickets said 9:30-12:30 Aaron carter show. After the third \"opening cover band\" came on we asked for a refund as we had bought 3 drinks a piece and wanted to meet up with friends elsewhere. We asked for a refund for the entry fee as the online and facebook advertisements were grossly misleading. The robotic and unpleasant manager, Ryan Brynne (sp?) was extremely rude and told us that \"the show is 9:30 until 12:30 and I can't do anything for you.\" Extremely disappointed. Will not return."}
{"text":"If you guys are ready for the worst thing since Guy Fieri's Times Square restaurant you're in luck! Let's mix an laziness with a side of DGAF. BOOM Hard Rock Cafe. Want to wait 20 minutes for a drink? Hit the HRC! Seriously the best."}
{"text":"Can the portions BE ANY BIGGER! I rather pay 1/2 the price for 1/2 the portion. Ordered nachos to start, thank god I stopped there. The nachos were (no joke), on a 10 inch plate, filled to the top, with all sorts of things. I ate maybe 4 bites an couldn't look at this monstrous plate. Service was very slow, had to chase down a hostess to a waitress to someone to check you out. It's ok. Go sit outside if you want nice view of Station Square."}
{"text":"I had  the ribeye steak, while my two friends had the salmon.  The ribeye was gristly and flavorless.  They said their salmon was very dry.  The broccoli and mashed potato sides were decent.  The service was average."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a talking stick arena event and stopped here for some drinks before hand. I ordered a mojito that was not a mojito. It was definitely just a rum and sprite with some mint and limes. The bartender was very nice I just didn't like her bartending skills or lack their of."}
{"text":"I attended a hosted Las Vegas Meetings and Events Winter party here on the third level here last night.   I was very impressed from the moment I walked in with how friendly the greeters/hostesses were to the servers and bartenders. On the strip sometimes it's hit or miss with encountering service people who actually act like they love their job.   If you had the privilege of seeing the previous Hard Rock Cafe this one just blows the old one out of the water! Very spacious and spread out, on the third level which is where I spent my evening is a nice sized stage and dancing area, with tables around the outside rim if you wanted to sit and listen to the music. Upstairs (and on the 2nd level) they also have an outside patio overlooking the strip. Inside is typical bar and dinner seating, as well as a section of secluded lounge chairs. (They have these little loungey areas on the second level too.) The tables around the couches act as a touch computer screen where you can play videos and flip through photos all with the touch of your finger!  Since the event was hosted, I can't comment on cost or really the food, as they just had passed h'ordeuvres. Everything was fried, which is OK, but I know they were trying to feed the masses and those items were probably the cheapest.   I tried the coconut shrimp, pot stickers and egg rolls, not much to say, they didn't have any flare or kick to them that would make them stand out from any other bar, but having eaten at Hard Rock's across the country I know they always do a solid American Cuisine- Love the there veggie burger!   This would be a fun place to get a group together for a dinner party or birthday. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hard Rock Cafe is one of those places where if you've been to one, you've basically been to them all.  I've visited better Hard Rocks as far as the famous trinkets go, but the service was better in Phoenix.    Tips: - Parking for this HRC leaves much to be desired. - Across the street from the arena where Phoenix Suns play, so good to catch some grub before a game, concert or other event at the arena."}
{"text":"came here mega hungover for breakfast after attending a late-night vegas wedding. the place was super empty around 9.30am - not too surprising as i'm sure most people were still out from the night before or too hungover to move.  breakfast menu was pretty slim, maybe 5 or 6 options but the waitress said many of the normal menu items could be prepared if we asked. i ordered a standard breakfast for $10.85 - eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes. everything was great minus the bacon - a crazy thick layer of pepper and salt covered it. totalllllly gross. bacon doesn't need seasoning! it's great on its own!  service was fine, food came out fast, and it was more reasonably priced than i expected. it's good if you're in a hurry to get on the road, but if you're not in a time crunch, i suggest heading over to the strip for an amazing brunch buffet instead."}
{"text":"Michael was an AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME WAITER!!!!! (50 stars for him).   However, the food was HORRIBLE!  My taco was BAD!  The meat was cold, the tortilla was cold, and the whole thing was just COLD AND BLAND. Blah, not worth my $10.00 @ all."}
{"text":"I love Hard Rock Cafe, but this has to be the most unimpressive one I have ever been to.  The inside is your typical HRC, but there was hardly anyone there and the mood of the restaurant staff did not help, except for the manager.  She was upbeat, attentive, and had a constant smile on her face.  If it was not for her our experience would have been a total flop.    Kids' meals are $7.99 for an \"entree\", small side, and a drink.  We had 3 kid meals... Expensive!!!Chicken strip meal consisted of 3 strips that tasted like fish and 3 florets of broccoli.  The Mac-n-cheese was very good, IMO, but too \"cheesy\" for the 4 year old."}
{"text":"Welcome to the second largest Hard Rock Cafe!  Lots of great memorabilia. The King's golden microphone, Aerosmith sign, Keith Moon, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, and a ton of others. Acoustic breakfast everyday 8:30-11:00. Leave the hotel for a great breakfast and live music. Open air seating on the strip is nice as well."}
{"text":"Brand new menu debut for Hard Rock and the new burgers are amazing.  So unfortunately we had a little mishap with our order, but let me tell you first that's part of life, but how a staff deals with it speaks volumes, and man, the staff at the Hard Rock Pittsburgh is absolutely amazing!  One of the managers took his own time to explain a lot of the new menu, and really made you feel welcome.  One the mishap happened, they went out of their way to make it right and even go above and beyond that.  We also witnessed other servers working extremely hard to make patrons visits a good one!  Very impressed with the new menu and service!"}
{"text":"Food is good i went in September with a group service was great wait time was awesome for breakfast i suggest the breakfast burger great way to start your weekend in Vegas with bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Mary's"}
{"text":"Our waitress was really nice, I can't remember her name but she had long hair, dyed pink at the top of her head.   However, my boyfriend and I each had ordered medium burgers, which I always order from restaurants, and it looked like the burgers could get off of our plates and walk away. They were so rare that they looked like raw ground beef from the grocery store.  Our waitress was nice and had my burger re-cooked, but at the table next to us, another person had a similar issue. No changes were reflected on our nearly $80 bill. I'm not the type to complain so we paid and left, but we are not planning to go back.  I would go to a different location, however the new cook seems to be having issues."}
{"text":"They took a picture with me and a fake guitar and I didnt even buy anything. I just wanted to see if they have the FAT drinks you see everyone carrying on the street and they DO. Very nice staff and clean place to get some great food or a drink thats 2 feet long and $16"}
{"text":"Hard Rock is just okay.  I have actually been to many many Hard Rocks, but not always to eat.  Usually we are only going to get a guitar pin from the different cities we visit because we know the food isn't that good.  The food is never bad, it's just never that good.  Almost ever single time we go here, which I swear is too often, I order the Twisted Mac and Cheese.  I get this for two reasons.  One, I love mac and cheese, and two, I love cavatappi pasta.  HR's version of the classic cheesy pasta is a mildly spiced cheese sauce that lightly coats the curly pasta.  Don't expect to have a thick and creamy mac and cheese here.  You won't be getting that.  The pasta is then topped with the expected dry piece of blackened chicken.  Why expected?  It's expected because I have literally been to HR's all over the country, on both coasts, and every single one serves dry chicken.  I guess that's what they teach at the HR School of Cooking.  I guess they just put more focus on music than food.  Who knows.  Why I gave HR three stars I will never know.  Why I keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand.  Maybe they put crack in the mac.  That would explain why I order it time and time again.  If you haven't been, I suggest going just once.  It's fun to compare all the different HR's."}
{"text":"Use to be a staple when we traveled to go there and collect different t-shirts from all locations even I'm different countries.   Always had good burgers and use to like the orange smoothie which they don't have anymore.   Always very loud and great memorabilia throughout the restaurant.   Very good service and on top of things to please the person being served .  Kind of dated now but like the fact they are open late to serve you after a game or downtown activities."}
{"text":"I came here for a company event. Oh man, their food is terrible! Yeah....no.....that is all I have to say."}
{"text":"Nice selection of entrées. A bit crowded at times due to the location of the restaurant. Friendly staff. Nice place to people watch from the outdoor balcony."}
{"text":"I always love their fries...super yummy (and how I like them). I tried a new menu item, the Tropical Burger. It was definitely something different but pretty tasty.  My servers were okay, their service was passable lol."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, and an amazing atmosphere - highly recommended. All staff are super friendly and the bar staff love to sing along to the great taste in music."}
{"text":"My friend and I came into the Hard Rock for dinner before going to the Back Street Boy concert. We both work at a Hard Rock in Tennessee so we were thrilled to check out the Cleveland location. Our dinner was great, my friend ordered the fajitas and I ordered the Texan pork sandwich. I loved checking out the memorabilia on the walls. There were so many artists I like that they had their stuff hanging up. We both left with our souvenir glasses to take with us to remember our visit."}
