{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Quaint. It's the perfect word to describe this one. It's a nice little place to go if you have nothing to do on a weekend. They rent out quality bikes for the family (even double bikes!) and at a low rate, too! They have snacks and drinks and random things to decorate your house with and they little old lady and man that run the shop are just adorable!  Please, don't tell anyone I said 'adorable.' Just go there...it's fun, and the trail is pretty awesome. There was also live music happening today! 5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place.  Start, break or end your White River Trail bike ride here with a tasty sandwich.  In a world of franchise blah this is the real thing - a delightful, quirky, eclectic cafe and store in the historic Depot building in Springfield.  Everything's prepared fresh for you and the homestyle sandwich menu offers some delicious surprises and specials.
Most of all, go for the atmosphere and the care with which the owners run and maintain this unique spot.  Need to rent a bike?  They have those, too.  Sit outside or inside and just e-n-j-o-y.
So far I've sampled the chicken salad (yum!) - the brat (fine) - a pulled pork sandwich (delish) and a turkey wrap with added zing of cranberry.  Tastes home-made - simple, unpretentious fare - but GOOD.  And the venue is a WINNER.  We'll be back - and telling everyone we know to come here."}
{"text":"What a nice and quaint little place. We saw quite a few ads for the place so we thought we would check it out during our vacation in Lake Geneva away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

This place was so refreshing! We first rented bikes for an hour and took a ride on the trail that goes right past it. It's pretty much in the middle of nowhere but that's so refreshing sometimes.

After our ride, we came back and there were two guys pickin' and playing on the front porch. We went in and ordered a sandwich and smoothie. We had the sandwich special of the day, turkey with a cranberry mayo, made from scratch. It was so delicious! We sat outside in a gliding rocker and listed to the guys play some old songs.

We went inside and looked around the place at all of the little trinkets and antiques they have on display for sale. Such a great little place and the owners are so nice! They were so kind to us and chatted our ears off. We highly recommend you give it a try."}
