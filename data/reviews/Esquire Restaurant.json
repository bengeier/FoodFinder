{"text":"I've been coming here for years and mostly in weekends and around dinner time when the place gets busy and the food is fresh.  Since the new owner has taken over and installed the new TVs as menus.. I've stopped for sometime because the food went downhill. Now the food is good again but they've replaced tzatziki sauce with plain sour cream!! Are you kidding me??!??"}
{"text":"I have been enjoying late night Chicken Soulvaki Dinner's here for over 30 years.      Open very late on weekends and great place to eat when you are heading home from a nightclub .     Extremely generous portions and the food is always delicious .      It is hard to choose between the fries or the potatoes and rice .. as you have the option of either with this dinner and either option is so good .  .     The booths are a bit tight to sit in ,  there are a few tables with pull out chairs ..The place can get quite busy on late  Friday and Saturday nights .. The food is made as you order it and it usually takes about 20 minutes to get your order ,  but well worth the wait ."}
{"text":"I had it to go.  Ordered over the phone during lunch time and still had to wait when I got there but it was expected since I saw the reviews from the other reviewers.  I think I waited approx 15 min.  There were approx 7 customers ahead of me, but I think it was either because of my advance phone call or what I had ordered (large Greek salad and a stick of chicken), I managed to get my order before 2 customers ahead of me in line.  Either way, worth the wait if you have time.  The food was tasty.  I will go back when I am not in a rush,  will definitely budget the time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years as this is also a staple in the community. Anyone who knows anything knows to order the chicken dinner as I think that's what they're best known for. The hot hamburger isn't a bad choice if you're looking for something a little more rich. The Greek fries are my favorite with a side of the zatziki. Open late however they only accept cash so come prepared."}
{"text":"We ordered ahead of time, two pork souvlaki dinners.  We wait, head there and 20mins after placing our order they're just throwing it on the grill.  A customer dispute was holding up our order because a couple was served ice cold rice.  Finally we receive our order reluctantly it seemed and headed home to eat what we thought would be an excellent meal.  My pork souvlaki was undercooked and my wifes was burnt.  Might try it again as I have had fantastic meals there before, but this review will remain as a two."}
{"text":"Great Greek for this part of town. Beats a lot of places on the danforth too. If your really hungry get the full souvlaki dinner. If you're not that hungry get the souvlaki on a bun or pita. I prefer the bun over the pita it's a little cleaner to eat and feels like I get more (not sure if u actually do though). Steak on a kaiser is good too but can be a bit messy... But who really cares this is casual Greek dining at it's best."}
{"text":"If you want to wait over 45 minutes for mediocre food then Esquire is the place to go. Save yourself time and money and head over to Johnnys next door."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super yummy Greek food, large quantities. My brother and I got take out and ordered the gyro and pork soulvaki dinner and it came to $26 taxes all in. We were both beached whales when we are done. Super juicy and tender meat, heaping piles of rice and large potatoes, and a pretty large Styrofoam container filled with Greek salad."}
{"text":"I used to eat the hot hamburger here a lot, and it was really good, but when I had the gyros dinner I felt like such an idiot for not getting that this whole time. SO GOOD! I really like their tzatziki sauce too, it looks plainer than most tzatziki's do, it's just looks like sour creme, but don't let that fool you, it's very flavorful. The greek salad is also really good."}
{"text":"Super slow service! Staff is rude. Food is ok but they ran out of onions at lunch! You can't have a Greek salad or pork pita without some onions. Portions are decent."}
{"text":"Through the years, I've consistently heard many rant and rave about Esquire's Souvlaki. Our order tonight included a Chicken Souvlaki Dinner, Chicken Souvlakis on a Pita and Bun, Greek Fries, and a Greek Salad.  The truth of the matter is that though the portions are generous, they are kind of lacking in the flavour department.  The Greek Salad was overly dressed, and sour to the point that my face started doing all sorts of facial gymnastics to cope. I would definitely ask for dressing on the side the next time.  The Chicken Souvlaki lacked the zing of fresh lemon and oregano. By the volume that they're cranking out, I wouldn't be surprised to know that they don't have time to marinate it.   Moreover, the hallmark of any great Greek meal is Tzatziki. And unfortunately, unlike all the amazing Tzatziki I've had on the Danforth, etc, this was runny and lacked flavour. I don't think they use Greek Yogurt as the base, and there were no signs of garlic or cucumber to be found. The portion was generous, but not appetizing.  The highlight for me were the Greek Fries. Drizzled in a Lemon/Olive Oil/Oregano mixture, and topped with Feta. Though it could have used more feta. But truth be told, there can never be enough Feta ;)  Square Boy and Hunter's Pizza still have my #1 spots for affordable and speedy Souvlaki on the east end."}
{"text":"The food I have to admit is pretty good. .generous portions. .at reasonable prices. ..BUT the service and wait time for basically a Burger joint is a joke. .stop being so f___ing cheap and hire more kitchen help. .waiting over half an hour for a souvaki on a bun is ridiculous. .and showing preference to preferred customers is also something that happens quite regularly. ..Again not bad..BUT grab a bite to eat before heading out to this joint"}
{"text":"This was my spot for over 10 years if not more. The other week we were there...having our souvlaki dinners and noticed some confusion behind the counter only to hear the cook pointing to the floor and telling the cash girl and his assistant \"there's another one there\". Then the girl took some powder and pouring it over the floor. Then all 3 of them were looking at the floor.  What that something on the floor was, I'll never know but I'm glad that I was there at the right time in order to witness this. I will make sure to let all my friends know. I was going to report them and have the place inspected. I wonder if it's too late...."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. Don't believe anyone that says this place is a good late-night spot - because it's not.   I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner and the chicken was flavourless and more dry than sand paper. The salad was extremely soggy due to all the dressing and the potatoes were not fully cooked or even hot for that matter. And prepare for an earful if you want more than the 1 napkin that you've been given.  The worst part of the experience was with the staff. To say they are rude and unprofessional would be an understatement. They act as if it's some huge honour to be eating there. Yet, they take their sweet time in serving patrons (even during busy periods!) and show a total disinterest in you as a customer.   Overpriced, poor quality, and a total lack of customer service - You're better off going next door to Johnny's Hamburgers."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new management, but it seems that they're trying more as of late. Love their chicken and fries...please bring back the tzatziki sauce!"}
{"text":"Based on the exterior and decor of this restaurant it doesn't look very appealing,  but I have to say it's one of those 'hole in the wall' places with surprisingly good food!   I got a gyro dinner for about $12. The gyro pieces were huge, and it was fresh and delicious. Similar to Jimmy the Greek chains,  but the portions are even more generous,  including the tzatziki!   Overall,  good service,  bang for your buck in terms of portions,  and great taste."}
{"text":"If you live in Scarborough, you have to know Esquires. Family and friends have been coming here for years. Good for late nights out when you're hungry after partying or... just because you're hungry and want dinner.   Best bets are chicken souvlaki on a pita or on a bun, or chicken souvlaki dinner, rice, potatoes and greek salad.... or the poutine on the side. Opt for the poutine. Skip the garlic bread.   Cash only by the way."}
{"text":"This is my Review, Complaints about:  Esquire Restaurant 2581 Victoria Park Ave Scarborough, Ontario Canada M1T 1A4 email: info@esquire-restaurant.com phone: 416-497-0618 http://www.esquire-restaurant.com/   The tables are very dirty, they're not cleaned well, I posted pictures of them here on Yelp, they should use soap or Lysol to disinfect and clean the tables well, not leaving Grease on their tables.  I had ordered the food for dining in NOT takeout, when I ordered Coke, the employee had taken the Coke out from the fridge and placed it on the counter which didn't make sense, it takes the chicken about 20 mins to cook while the Drinks are outside getting warm, they should take the drinks out when the food is ready not 20 mins before.  So when the food was ready I asked the employee to replace the Coke with a new cold one from the fridge, he didn't understand why, the Indian tall guy Chef not sure what his name is, told the other employee \"Put the Coke in boiling water\" I guess it was a joke but kind of a stupid one.  Then the same Chef asked me \"Do you like Tzatziki sauce?\" Meanwhile Tzatziki sauce always comes with the Chicken dinner food that I ordered so it was stupid that he asked me that question, then he asked again \"Do you like Tzatziki sauce?\" With a smile, and then he said \"I thought you don't like it\", and the other employees on the side started laughing, when he said that he actually meant Sper*, which is very disgusting and Haram, he is calling Tzatziki sauce a Sper*, and he's asking me if I like it, which is very Haram and disgusting.  I will be reporting this restaurant first thing in the morning to:  Ministry of Health HMA \"Halal Certifier in Canada\" http://www.hmacanada.org Better Business Bureau http://www.bbb.org Restaurant and Food Service Inspection in Canada \"http://inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/report-a-concern/restaurants-and-food-services/eng/1323139279504/1323140830752\"  As well as posting on several other internet review sites about this Disgusting Dirty Restaurant."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Went here based on the bragging of a family member.  Two dinners comes to 28 bucks.  The Greek salad is in fact not Greek at all . It's made with balsamic vinegar. And pepper. Too spiced to enjoy. The chicken is burnt , the potatoes are bland and you only get two small pieces and the rice is plain white rice.  This was by far the worse imitation of Greek food I ever had. I will continue to go to Jimmy the Greek for the price and quality of food.  I was very dissapointed when I opened my take out dinner plate which is a round metal plate like at a Chinese food store, that there was one spoon of rice like a spatula full. If it wasn't for the bread ,I would still be hungry. Overall I definitely will not go again.   Very small amount for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Super huge fan of their GREEK FRIES. Oh my gosh man, so good yet so bad for us. BUT SO GOOD!!  I've sampled their chicken sticks, delicious. I'm sure everything else is amazing too. Awesome service, however the wait time can get annoying. But worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know too much about Greek food, and don't often visit Greek places but Esquire sure is at the top of my list!!  Whenever I get that rare hunger for Greek food, I always choose Esquire.   Big portions and extremely savory food, sometimes I'll finish the whole dish with regret, but it's just so damn tasty! My go to dish is always the chicken souvlaki dinner. It comes with souvlaki (obviously) and your choice of fries, rice, salad or potatoes. Mind you though you already get a salad with it but I guess if you want to double the salad portion. Also a side of two or three slices of garlic bread.  Marinade on the meat is spot on and got that certain grease to it that you will love. Everytime I order my usual, the chicken is ALWAYS juicy, ALWAYS. Salad and side choices are also great, super delicious flavours that never let me down. I can't say any bad things about Esquire because for the price you pay it sure is worth it.  A tip to keep in mind though is to call ahead of time, it can usually take a good 20 - 25 mins to make your order as this place is always rammed with people. Even on a slow day it takes that long. I'll always call ahead, and I live roughly 25 minutes away and sometimes my order isn't even ready. So give them a bit of a grace period.  Really friendly people here, the Chef you will love and really does enjoy talking to customers, makes me wonder how long that guy has been working there. I've never dined in so my review is solely based off of take out."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of business by everything is fresh and cooked well. I grabbed a souvlaki dinner ,  good portions well worth it"}
{"text":"Good food but loses plenty of stars due to the lack of service you receive. Employees are not friendly at all and can't even bring themselves to crack a smile. Would not recommend due to the lack of service you will receive, plus the super long wait times."}
{"text":"Best Greek Salad I have ever had. I love their Chicken Souvlaki Dinner. The portion is BIG and I really like their rice!  Sometimes you have to wait; it's casual but not 'fast food'.... But so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Service is horrendous.  Place is a dump. Food poisoning waiting to happen. Hope you like medium rare chicken!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  The prices are reasonable!  The Greek Salad is delicious EXCEPT.......  You gotta have Onions please!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a Greek-staple by choice of many including myself as you can see by the reviews - pretty self explanatory.  Exactly that; only order the chicken souvlaki entrée w/ a beer preferably.. And you're nestled in on a delicious, fresh & satisfying experience (every time).. without fail it's comfort food at your best!  . Everyone that's been here craves it and comes back.  The portions are proper, the quality is great also considering it's a fave for everyone so therefore freshness is inevitable.  The only extra portion is the garlic bread and let me explain..  wrap a souvlaki chicken inside that and dunk it into their in-store tzatziki dipping! Greek salad is fresh and standard.. Rice & potatoes or fries, whatever you choose it's all good! Don't forget to ask for hotsauce on the side lol..  Go enjoy :) classic joint for some classic goodness."}
{"text":"This is a great place to for a flavourful dine at any time... The tzatziki dip is really garlicky, therefore it might be a bad idea for a first date.   I used to go here a lot more often (when it was under the old management), but the somewhat slow service and the unfriendly staff sort of turn me away from this place. But never the less, if you can put up with that, the food still tastes great, and is very affordable. The gyros and the chicken souvlaki are really flavorful. Around 2-3am on Friday and Saturday, this place is packed, and the wait times are sometimes too long. They often run out of gyros too."}
{"text":"I've been reading some of the other reviews and I totally agree that this place is really UNDERRATED. I came across Esquire by accident about a year ago and I have to say it's one of those hidden gems in Scarborough. Huge fan of their Chicken Souvlaki Dinner - for about $13 they stuff it with so much food (Chicken Souvlaki, Fries/Rice, Potatos, Salad, Garlic Bread, tzatziki sauce).It's also one of the only stores that are open really late on the weekends (I believe its still till 2 am). Service is also really good, typically your food will be ready within 10-15 mins.   However, they only take CASH! So don't make the mistake of going with visa/debit."}
{"text":"This has been a regular spot for me for years. Why? I live close by, It's open late, reasonably priced and the food is consistent and good. The staff may be slightly biased towards me as I am a regular however the service is always amazing for me.   I typically get the chicken souvlaki and/or gyros with a Greek salad. The feta is always fresh as is the salad.   I don't really care for the rice or the garlic bread just because I find it to be extremely bland and tasteless. The potatoes are ok sometimes but again I find that it can be a little tasteless too.   I also highly recommend the homemade burger (one of my favorites! I usually ask for feta on it which is an extra cost but worth it) or souvlaki or gyros on a bun.   Just a suggestion: if you are planning on coming here it's probably best to call ahead of time and place your order just so you can be in and out and not wait long."}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably my favourite souvlaki place. Old styled diner. Huge portions. Lemon sauce and greek fries are amazing. I personally love the gyros on a pita that this place serves. Open till 3am. Tried ...tasted ...true!!"}
{"text":"I went there twice and left.  REASON: I have heard from numerous people that Esquire's gyro's are to die for. I went there the first time thinking I would order it at approximately 9p. They were sold-out, it was understandable. We ended up ordering pork souvlaki pita. I am not a big fan of pork but I enjoyed mine - it tasted like chicken. Second time I went there, it was at 1p on a Saturday. A few individuals were there but not a huge crowd. Gyros are sold out. I haven`t been there since last month. I am still waiting to go there as soon as they open for gyro.   Overall, I like their tzatziki sauce and pork souvlaki. It was pretty good and it also came with a salad. Order your salad separate from the dressing. Not sure if they use canola oil or olive oil for their dressing so I tend to have it on the side. It tends to be overwhelmed with dressing."}
{"text":"I agree that the portions are huge. Came here for a quick lunch after a meeting, the system they use for calling out orders could be better considering everyone orders the same thing and they just call out what you ordered.   I order the chicken souvlaki dinner which comes with either fries, rice or rice and potatoes + Greek salad and beard. I opted for the the rice and potatoes.   The quality of the entire meal was mediocre at best, the best part of the meal was the chicken. It wasn't dry but it wasn't THAT juicy. The dressing they used was lemon based and it overtook the salad as well as the rice as it spread over.   The price to portion ratio was good. I would come again but maybe for a late-night dinner as there are many more choices during the day."}
{"text":"This is the only greek restaurant in the area. It's close to my office. It's not a place I visit often because greek food is heavy and after eating I feel sleepy and can't work. But once in a while I splurge and come here.   I usually get the chicken souvlaki. It tastes like...chicken souvlaki. The food is decent and I have no complaints about them. Pretty standard fare. The only minor difference is they give you this piece of bread, which a lot of Greek restaurants don't. Not really a plus or a minus to me.   If you care about portion, there's the Hakka restaurant next door which is better bang for your buck. But this is greek food. The prices are pretty much on point. I would come more often if everything was just $1 less."}
{"text":"Their Greek fries and chicken souvlaki on a stick is to die for. All their foods are well done! So good, definitrly worth a try"}
{"text":"Esquire Restaurant is a family run Greek restaurant located in a plaza on the southeast corner of Victoria Park Ave and Sheppard Ave East that has been serving the Scarborough area since 1981. Esquire Restaurant and Johnny's Hamburgers have been staples of that area for a long time. You wouldn't know it by looking at the current ethnic demographics but years back, upper Scarborough use to have a very large Greek community and from my understanding this use to be the go to place for Greek food in upper Scarborough.  I decided to drop in on a weekday around late afternoon to grab a late lunch and I decided on the chicken souvlaki dinner ($12.25 plus) which seemed to be their most popular item since I noticed everybody dining in eating it. You place your order and grab a seat and when your order is ready, you would grab your food from the front and bring it back to your table.   The chicken souvlaki dinner was reasonably priced ($12.25 plus tax) and the portions were very generous. The dinner came with rice, potatoes, a Greek salad, a skewer of chicken souvlaki and a few slices of toasted garlic bread. Everything was fresh and nicely done but the chicken while nicely seasoned and nicely charred was a tad on the dry side and lacked the tenderness and juiciness a great chicken souvlaki should taste like. It was okay but definitely not great like some of it's counterparts on the Danforth which are priced a few dollars higher but the quality is better overall.  The decor is really old school with paintings on the wall and the outer part of the restaurant is lined with tables and the inner part of the restaurant are lined with booths. The place was quite clean from what I could see.   It's hard to comment on service since there are no waitstaff and essentially you pay for your order at the cashier and when your order is ready, you pick it up from the front which results in less interaction than a full service restaurant.  Overall, it's not a bad choice for Greek food in upper Scarborough and if you're looking for a hearty meal at very reasonable prices than you should definitely check out Esquire Restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.   GIGANTIC portions. It's usually packed during lunch with line ups sometimes near the door but there were no lines on Friday at noon-ish. My party of 6 was able to grab booth seats.  Paid $13 for the pork souvlaki dinner and it includes rice, bread, potatoes, and a nicely sized Greek salad. Tons of carbs but I can easily split this into 2 meals!  TIP: call in advance to place an order to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"This restaurant is across the street from where I work and I recently tried it after a co-worker recommended it to me.  They have amazing Greek food, and I was very impressed with the portion size also!  Everything is made fresh to order and not like a typical take out restaurant where they make items in bulk and leave the food under warmers.  You can call ahead to order and your food is ready in about 15-20 mins.  They accept cash only - no debit or credit, so come prepared for that.  They also have daily specials.  There is plenty of seating available if you choose to eat in.  It is also quite affordable considering the food is made fresh."}
{"text":"As someone who's worked in the service industry for many years, I'm highly offended. I only gave 1 star because I had to. A friend and I came in 30 mins before closing (they close at 10pm on Sundays) and we both ordered the steak dinner.  FOOD: First of all, I ordered my steak rare and it came out well done. I didn't ask them to fix it because I already waited so long for my food to be ready. I also realized they forgot my drink so I walked over and got it from them. I was ready to dig in until I noticed they forgot my garlic bread as well. When I asked for it, they gave me normal bread. I got up again and requested for them to put garlic on it, and I received burnt bread that was still garlic-less. Great. Lastly, I had to ask for my tzatziki sauce which they also never gave me. By the time I realized I never got my steak sauce, I was too lazy to get up for the millionth time to ask for it.  SERVICE: At 10:02pm, one guy asked if we were done because he needed to close. There was clearly still food in front of us. Maybe if there hadn't been so many issues with our orders then we would've finished faster, but anyway... 5 minutes later they rudely told us we had to leave. I finished what was left of my overcooked steak as fast as possible just because of how uncomfortable they made us feel. Then as we got up to leave, a worker pointed at the garbage and told us to clean our table. My friend and I were pretty upset already so we left the mess behind. As we were waking out, we could hear the same guy giving us attitude and kissing his teeth.  I would never return to esquire, let's get that out of the way. As a server, I know what it feels like for a table to stay longer than they're supposed to, but we were out the door by 10:10pm... Nothing too excessive. They should have let us stay long enough to finish eating our horribly serviced food in peace at the very least."}
{"text":"OK for a cheap late night eat in Scarborough, although their gyros could be seasoned better. Also cash only!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and very tasty! Portions are huge!!  Boy, this place does get very busy at times. I think it is much better to call ahead to order, because if you don't, you will probably end up waiting at least 20-25 minutes for your food.  Cleanliness is not so good at this place, though. Some tables I feel a little anxious to sit in, I just don't feel the seating area is clean enough.  I would recommend this place for a good take-out place, would probably not dine in as the place gets really loud, and the TV is very loud as well. But I have no complaints about the food - very tasty and the portions are huge.."}
{"text":"Nice place, like the booths. Seemed clean, staff was friendly. Open extremely late. Cash only, by the way.  We each ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Dinner  - Chicken was very good. Moist, juicy, well seasoned -- whatever marinade they use is great - Side greek salad was quite yummy, albeit small - Rice was decent although could have had more flavour... we ended up putting salt/pepper on it, then when it still didn't feel flavourful enough, we rubbed it around in the salad dressing - The potato chunks were huge. 2 big blocks. But they were tasty - The 3 slices of bread were really yummy, well seasoned too - None of us really found their tzatziki sauce that good... it had too much lemon. They give you a good quantity, but the taste was only average. I'd prefer a more garlic-oriented tzatziki, personally - We also tried their poutine which was average at best.  All in all, it was a good souvlaki dinner and filling, but also rather expensive at $12.25 (no drink)  I give it 3/5 because, one, I don't think the value is there. I think that chicken souvlaki plate is well worth it for maybe $9.... but $12.25? You're talking $14 with tax.  Plus one of my fave parts of a greek dinner plate is dipping everything into the tzatziki... potato pieces, chicken, the bread, everything... so if your tzatziki sauce is your weakest link, it scores a bit less.  Also, I found the service fairly slow considering it wasn't that busy.  Otherwise, we quite enjoyed it. I'd go back but because I'm frugal, it would be a rarity. It's a bit steep for me. Sure I felt full, but the components weren't enough to justify the price."}
{"text":"This family run restaurant has long been a favorite of mine.  With reasonable prices and generous portions, its hard to go wrong.  Id make this a solid 5 if the service was a little friendlier. I think many years in the food industry has left them tired and without passion for their business.   Its a good thing the food hasnt suffered as a result.  great for take out or dine in.  get the gyros dinner and you wont be hungry for a long time....."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. It's a small restaurant with big portions for a reasonable price. Sometimes it can be a bit slow BUT that is not a criticism because the food is made fresh in front of you (yes you can see them cooking). They have the best gyros I have ever had and their tatziki is so delicious. No matter where I go in the world, I always compare gyros that I eat abroad to the gyros at Esquire and I swear, nothing compares."}
{"text":"UNDERRATED!  My boyfriend and love their Chicken Dinner Souvlaki! Always huge portion. We love Greek food but this one is really IT!   Prices are cheaper than other Greek Restaurant in comparison but service level and food quality can still superb. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like the food here but they should never have \"dine in\" service.  I sat and watched as order after order of take out went out the door while the trays for those dining in did not move.  After 40 minutes of waiting I finally went up to complain and they basically brushed me off.  This place should be take out only."}
{"text":"Generous portions of food, always hits the spot for my Greek food cravings. Only thing is that it's missing that tomato sauce on rice/potatoes I usually get from other Greek restaurants.   Workers are always friendly and welcoming.   Food is 4 stars; chicken is never dry, rice and potatoes well cooked; salad is amazing.  Price is reasonable and I never leave hungry.  Tzatziki sauce; big portions but too much garlic in my opinion, still yummy. I love to mix it with my rice   Only reason this place doesn't get a full 5 stars is the cleanliness.. this place gets so busy that the workers don't have time to clean.   Would recommend this to hungry people who are down for Greek."}
{"text":"As someone who enjoys Greek food, I'm not coming back here! The food portions are ok in size but almost every other Greek restaurant I've been to is tastier and don't even get me started about the service!"}
{"text":"You walk up to the counter, and place your order. They feature delicious souvlakis and a basic assortments of other combos of Greek origin.  Their combos all feature an abundant order of rice or French fries (delicious). For the lighter eaters, they have a nice Horiatiki, but the Feta is grated (I much prefer it in chunks).  The service is fast and cheerful, and all items are prepared while you wait. Your number will be called, and you can dive into your order. They are open fairly late, so for us, its a good place to go for a late nosh.  Reliable, tasty and garlicky tzaziki......What else does one need?"}

{"text":"I love generous people. I love generous portions! I love generous portions of delicious, homemade, fresh greek salad, warm rice, MONSTER potatoes and chicken souvlaki dinner! Silly me still was asking for a side of garlic bread. It comes included!  The restaurant possibly seats about 50, but do note, there is at least a 15 min wait to get served. You order at the cash. Pay in cash (only cash accepted). And pay attention to what you ordered because your order will be called. Not your name. Not your number."}
{"text":"Dropped by Esquire since I was in the same plaza, the place is a little run  down, upon entering there were many tables that werent cleaned. You order up at the counter, and then fit and wait until they call for your order. I ordered the gyro and chicken souvlaki to share with a friend. Portions are huge, seems like everything is made in house, and they dont stinge on their tzatziki sauce. Overall, not bad, ill most likely be back for take out next time."}
{"text":"Good Greek food can be tricky in this city. Personally, I don't enjoy the restaurants on the danforth. They are always so busy and kinda expensive for no reason.   My sister introduced me to Esquire located at Vic Park and the 401, now don't judge a book by it's cover. The place doesn't look the greatest and probably hasn't been renovated ever. I ordered the Gyro Plate and Grilled Chicken Plate.   They are so generous with the food here, those 2 plates cost me around $25 (that's pretty cheap). When they told me my order was ready, I was surprised at how big it was.   Each Plate came with a separate side salad that comes in a large container, garlic bread and pita bread. Then in another big container, there's rice, potatoes, and whatever meat. PLUS lots of Tzatziki!  I was surprised by how good it was. It all worked perfectly together, the rice and potatoes had a lemon sauce that was delicious; the gyro with the Tzatziki was perfect.   I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back!   Oh and Cash Only!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Whenever I order Greek food I only order chicken cause I think the other meats are to dry.. but I decided to order the Gyro meal. The meat was hot, moist and delicious  I still think about it. And the pita bread there is soft and buttered. I ate everything on my plate! They accept cash only."}
{"text":"Restaurant is alway super busy and a good alternative to fast food. The food is consistent, fresh and is simply good home style cooking.  Bring your patience with you the wait for food is sometimes annoying. Also the cash only is strange in this day and age, make sure you have cash."}
{"text":"Instead of going to Johnny Burgers, wanted to give this place a try, and I have to say that I regret my decision....got take out from this place, chicken souvlaki dinner for $12.75....chicken was dry and tasteless, fries were cold and soggy and the salad was drenched in dressing that was pretty gross....I will not be coming back to this place ever again....expensive for crappy food, I rather eat at jimmy the greek in the mall food court"}
{"text":"So I am sitting here waiting for my food...its been 15 minutes already. Employees are standing at the front, cracking jokes and being loud and obnoxious.   I looked at the reviews and decided to come here. But after their customer service and seeing how they behaving, I probably will never come back again.  Oh, and I am writing this review instead of getting my food served might explain level of annoyance I am going through right now.  Update: I just received my food and I have to say its great.  Would have definitely came back if their customer service was good"}
{"text":"The tables are very dirty, they're not cleaned well, I posted pictures of them here on Yelp, they should use soap or Lysol to disinfect and clean the tables well, not leaving Grease on their tables.  I had ordered the food for dining in NOT takeout, when I ordered Coke, the employee had taken the Coke out from the fridge and placed it on the counter which didn't make sense, it takes the chicken about 20 mins to cook while the Drinks are outside getting warm, they should take the drinks out when the food is ready not 20 mins before.  So when the food was ready I asked the employee to replace the Coke with a new cold one from the fridge, he didn't understand why, the Indian tall guy Chef not sure what his name is, told the other employee \"Put the Coke in boiling water\" I guess it was a joke but kind of a stupid one.  Then the same Chef asked me \"Do you like Tzatziki sauce?\" Meanwhile Tzatziki sauce always comes with the Chicken dinner food that I ordered so it was stupid that he asked me that question, then he asked again \"Do you like Tzatziki sauce?\" With a smile, and then he said \"I thought you don't like it\", and the other employees on the side started laughing, when he said that he actually meant Sper*, which is very disgusting and Haram, he is calling Tzatziki sauce a Sper*, and he's asking me if I like it, which is very Haram and disgusting.  I've also seen many disgusting things they do while they cook, this restaurant is NOT clean, if you get diarrhea after you eat here, then you should go to your doctor and ask for a stool test, then contact the ministry of health to report them.  I had reported this restaurant to the following organizations and they didn't reply back to me, they didn't seem to care at all! the system here in Canada is just a show, it's BS :  Ministry of Health HMA \"Halal Certifier in Canada\" http://www.hmacanada.org Better Business Bureau http://www.bbb.org Restaurant and Food Service Inspection in Canada \"http://inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/report-a-concern/restaurants-and-food-services/eng/1323139279504/1323140830752\"  As well as posting on several other internet review sites about this Disgusting Dirty Restaurant"}
{"text":"This place fails to capture the greatest dine-in experience, yet is still in the good books for me as it's open late Fridays/Saturdays and serves decent chicken souvlaki in big portions. More than Mr.Greek portions and better quality for around the same prize. CASH ONLY amigos! There is a TD bank in the same plaza so fear not, you plastic card devotees.  Any resto with fluorescent fixtures is bound to put off ambiance to cafeteria setting, so I've noticed the drunkies walking in half blind trying to read off the menu and maintaining composure to prevent barfing on the cashier counter. Yes, so if you're here picking up some grub pass 12 am, expect to witness a few guys struggle with their table manners.  A lot of people complain about the staff being rude. Some of them are nice though, however I know of one who really got on my nerves (back in July '14)as he insisted on military way of taking orders and payment and refuse any menu inquiries. I haven't seen him recently which made the experience far more pleasant.  One employee shouldn't really hurt a business unless you've received the same poor treatment consistently from different servers. Just order ahead of time, you're in and out and souvlaki cravings satisfied."}
{"text":"Not bad. Good for what it is. Quick and informal dinner setting. Order at the bar. And sit down until you hear your name called. I would give it a 3.5. But no such option here. If you get the dinner it's plenty food. But for the same price and for service I'd rather goto hunters."}
{"text":"Tried this out on a friend's recommendation, the food here is good , good portions and a - ok for the price. Had the NY Steak Dinner with rice and potatoes. This I would recommend to everyone who loves meat (medium-rare of course) .  A must -try and staple . I'm starting to love greek food! At first , I thought \"mmm.. eh ok\" I admit the presentation isn't exactly 5-star, its like salad to the side with feta cheese and dressing dumped on top of a mound of lettuce, the rice in the middle of the plate baked potatoes and 2 slices of garlic bread just dumped on top and the huge steak to the side. (*whew! typing that was a mouthful already!)   As soon as you start eating, its good! Oh they give you fries as an option, rice for me just adds flavour and a kick to the steak! (herbed fragrant rice O_O)  Diner type Self-serve restaurant - I suggest you go early as the place can get easily filled up with their patrons. Is there a line-up, YES! definitely, but the line stays indoors. There's a line in cash, and another waiting time for food to be ready so be prepared for some pre-dinner entertainment for you and the kiddos.   Will definitely be coming back for their gyros and steak of course!  They open till 2AM on regular days Friday Saturday 4am and 10pm on Sunday."}
{"text":"3 stars??? I'm now convinced Torontoians are nuts.  What are you guys comparing this to?? This is one of the best Greek restaurants if not the best and yet it's half the price of the bugee spots on Danforth east, portions are huge, chicken is soft and fresh.  To quote our boy, this place is gucci down to the potatoe baby without the price tag.  Highly recommend for Greek."}
{"text":"Nice little Greek restaurant that has been around for years. I went with my friend who suggested it after a Roti restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for the evening. I ordered a greek souvlaki dinner. The portion was huge and the price was right ($12.00) However just when my order was ready, they told me they were out of potatoes and would substitute fries instead. I didn't want fries in the first place, so they should have offered another side dish or refunded me a portion of the bill. Giving a client something they didn't request or didn't want or order is totally disrespectful.  Rather than just shove an order of fries on the plate, they should have offered something else. Other than this issue, the food was fresh, but I had one other small issue, there were a lot of empty dirty tables there as well. No matter how busy it gets keeping tables clean should always be a priorty, there is nothing worse than walking into a restaurant and seeing messy tables everywhere ...Would I go back here again? Probably not..."}
{"text":"Classic joint. Not much changes around here, thank goodness. It is still cash only. What you have to know from the get go is that THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC GREEK FOOD, but that doesn't matter one bit! The value for the quality of the chicken is unbeatable. The salad is fresh and made on the spot; you just don't get that in many other places for this kind of money.  Sure they drench it in oily dressing, but that is because that is how we like it. It's not Greek food, it's Scarborough food. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We ended up at Esquire due to the unreasonable late night lineup at a nearby burger joint. The place was quite packed and seems to have a steady group of regulars. Service was pretty quick despite the number of customers and you have a chance to customize your sandwiches which is always a plus. The atmosphere is not the greatest but the rest of the experience compensates well.   We tried a few items including the burger and chicken souvlaki. The burger really was not great, but the chicken souv is good enough to earn this place 4*. Definitely one of the best I've had in Toronto and the closest thing to my favourite Greek spot in Astoria!   Overall, if you want a cheap and delicious souvlaki then this is it!"}
{"text":"Everything you expected from a quick N famous grab N go restro. The price was decent $12 bucks for a donkey (as in larger than a normal person can eat) sized plate of amazing Greek food. I know you can't compare Greek and Middle-Eastern, but for that price and portion, it puts Paramount to shame.  I'd love to go back again this weekend. The meat here cooked very well. The Greek salad was delish. Fries, omg, the fries were crispy! Even after I opened up the takeout container when I got home. ammmmazing! And what's more amazing about it is that I had enough left overs for lunch next day! Winners all around!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and always get the chicken dinner, it's perfect! Chicken is always so juicy and the salad with their signature dressing is amazing. Always freshly made."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years food is usually consistent for the most part but the last time I was there and I mean my last time, near the end of my chicken souvlaki dinner I noticed a hair on my chicken, I didn't pay much attention to it but then on the same piece of chicken there was another hair. I'm not one to complain but I went up to tell them and they immediately started shutting me down saying there was nothing they could do because I ate most of it, although I made no request for compensation all I said was I found this in my food and the people working there were up in arms getting mad at me and they took it away quickly and didn't even apologize. I live just down the street if your looking for food without hair in it I suggest going to paramount at the opposite corner."}
{"text":"I've been here before but not in a long time always remember Esquires to be a great place for Greek food as well as burgers and such but after returning here after a small hiatus I figured the food would still be consistently good. Boy was I wrong service was slow food took forever to come out and believe it or not it was cold. The girl who dressed my pita dumped a ton of taziki on that and I actually found the restaurant to be pretty dirty which was unusual I figure they must have switched owners over the time I haven't been there I think it's safe to say I'll find somewhere else to get my Greek fix next time"}
{"text":"Great food for great price!!  only con is it takes forever for your order to get ready."}
{"text":"This seems to be the go to place after a night out on the town. I have been here twice and have enjoyed myself both times. This a Greek Restaurant that has the typical dishes u would find elsewhere. Both times I have been here the place was packed with customers. There portion sizes are large and satisfying for low price that won't break the bank. I think because there are only a few places in the city that are open late and even fewer places with sit down seating they have really cornered the late night owl market.  I do feel on the other hand they should use some of the income to renovate the place, nothing too crazy as this is a very lo key restaurant I think a new paint coat or new dishes would really make a world of a difference.   All this all the service is friendly, food is taste, location is easy to get to.. being right off the highway and the hours are great."}
{"text":"The home burger is awesome here. But the service is super slow and if you want to pay with plastic, it's not happening. The boys working are awesome and I have nothing bad to say about them, but seriously, it's 2016 and they still don't take credit/debit? Wow! 4 stars for food and 2 stars for operation. Averaged to 3 stars. Accept debit and get more staff to serve rush hour and this place is an easy 4 stars. I'll come back in a year and see if things have improved.   They spend money on LCD menu but not on staff. People fall asleep in line waiting for food. Hopefully things change. Good restaurant though.  I waited 30 minutes for my burger and it wasn't crazy busy either.  Update: Went in again for a homeburger and fries. They still don't accept debit or credit, cash only. Seems like a scam for tax purposes, no paper trail.  This time I had a horrible experience. An older gentleman, appears to be the owner or a manager of some sort calls my order. I walk up to the counter and he said \"ok ok I called you twice what do you want on your food?\". With a full restaurant I told him he can't talk to his customers like that and that I wanted a refund and I no longer want my food. I younger well mannered employee came up and very calmly gave me my refund back and that was it. I will not return ever again!"}
{"text":"Okay I am not really a fan of Greek food myself, this is also pretty standard fare.  However, it is pretty close, cheap and of acceptable quality therefore I declare this place my \"default Greek restaurant\" right now.  The portions are okay, it's a bit smaller than Zet's at Mississauga.  I've only been here once and got their Chicken Souvlaki Dinner for $11.75 + taxes (no tip needed).  Their chicken is moist and tender and their Tzatziki sauce portion is good enough for what you get.  They provide potatoes and sweet potatoes in their dinner dish.  Next time I go there I'm just going to get the Pork Souvlaki in a Pita.  The nice part about this is you have a place to sit down if the weather outside isn't good and they have a lot more selection than Johnny's which is right beside them.  I'll need to try this place out a few more times to see if it can dethrone Johnny's."}
{"text":"I believe this is the best Greek Restaurant in Toronto. The food is always fresh and the Greek Salad is excellent. They only accept cash and they can do what they want because the place is always busy."}
{"text":"Above average great food! Quick efficient service! Great late nights! Clean! Tasty and consistent taste! Could be less bright! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you like souvlaki, this is a great place and its open very late! They marinade the meat each morning and grill it fresh when you order it.  Its well spiced and juicy every time.   I haven't tried the potatoes or salad in a while so I'll reserve judgement.    Make sure you order pork or chicken, it blows the gyros out of the water.    Food ***1/2 Service **** (no table service) Ambience *"}
