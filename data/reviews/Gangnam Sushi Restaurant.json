{"text":"Ahh yes finally I've been waiting for their yelp to pop up cause I visited here a month back but their restaurant was nowhere to be found. 4*s is for SERVICE POINTS. 

This was my first time here and I couldn't really sit in to dine in so I can't really review on the actual restaurant experience so this review is for TAKEOUT ONLY.

I'm pretty sure this was the owner because he was kinda hulking over everything and everyone and making sure everything was going well (but kinda awks). I mean he was all smiles and very kind. 

What scared me was when he served me tea and it spilt on his hand and when I tasted the tea, IT WAS LIKE BOILING HOT WATER. I WAS LIKE IN MY HEAD ARE YOU OKAY IS YOUR HAND OKAY OMG THAT MUST HAVE BEEN SO PAINFUL. 

So naturally he was a strong, hulking, smiling guy who put up a very good front and was kind all at the same time. If I spilt boiling hot tea I would be cursing to myself in the back and ignoring the customer out front tbh so props to you man.

I ordered a Katsudon (Fried pork cutlet with rice) and it was fried to perfection(?). It was extremely thin (like it's similar to chinese crispy beef) and crispy and wasn't juicy, more greasy than it was juicy. I'm not gunna lie, I'm a sucker for crispy things, but this was lacking in terms of flavour and meat. If you had the katsu by itself, it tasted like the oil they fried it in and that was all there was. 

The rice pportion was pretty decent and the amount of side dishes they give you is quite refreshing and nice to pair with the already 12 dollar grease crisp.

I got cabbage kimchi, pickled radish and carrots, miso soup, and the usual iceberg salad. The kimchi was okay, it wasn't creally fermented and had decent flavour, also not as spicy as I'd like but it might be spicy for people who don't eat spicy regularly. The pickled radish and carrots had a wierd chemical taste to it like it almost tasted like petroleum so I ended up throwing that out. The miso and iceberg salad was nothing new.

Hope the business does well though because the old lady who got me my food was extremely nice ajima from aKdrama! Her service was impeccable and was extremely kind to me and her smile was so heartwarming omg. 

I highly recommend dining in as takeout probably doesn't do anyone justice here if this was how my food experience was going to be, but the service is definately great.

I however, probably won't be in the area again because it was convenient at the time to eat here. Thank you for having me ^^"}
{"text":"This Japanese/Korean restaurant used to be named and owned by different people. The inside looks the same as the old Korean/Japanese food restaurant and is quaint and small. The service and Korean side dishes are good. The bibimbap with bulgogi was tasty. The rice was nice and crispy in the hot stone bowl and the egg was fried perfectly. 

The spicy salmon roll was okay and their rolls are
small but bite sized. It's a nice little place to enjoy both Korean and Japanese food at one place and it isn't as busy as some other North York restaurants. It does have an odd parking lot so, if you can't find a spot just park on a side street nearby."}
{"text":"So we're hit and miss in terms of value. My last review still stands. This time, I came with my parents, and we ordered two things. From the main dish section, we ordered the tempura moriwase ($14.99). We also ordered a grilled mackerel and seafood soft tofu stew combo ($15.99). I was assuming that with the rice included, it'd be enough food for the three of us. I was sorely disappointed. 

My parents dropped me off so I could order while they ran a quick errand at Rona. I ordered and said that they could start making the food, as my parents would be there soon. I asked for tea, which they didn't just automatically bring out. They gave me one cup of tea, and a small bowl with six or seven pieces of edamame in it. Last time, with four people, they brought us a whole bowl full of edamame. I don't know whether they were thinking it was just for me or not, but they didn't bring any more out when my parents got there a few minutes later, so I don't know what happened there. We then had to ask for more tea. This was also when the lady said that she'd bring our order to the kitchen because our entire party was there. Clearly, she missed that I had asked for our food to begin cooking when I first ordered it. 

The tempura moriwase came with 6 shrimp and an assortment of veggie tempura. It did not come with rice. This is odd, especially if it is considered a main dish. It was also served in an appetizer-sized basket. I was actually quite shocked. While there were six shrimp, they were not particularly large, and there were maybe seven pieces of veggie tempura in the basket. Totally not worth the price. It was good tempura, and I appreciate that there was more than one piece of broccoli, but I still wouldn't get it again. So disappointed.

The grilled mackerel and seafood soft tofu stew did come with rice, for which I am grateful. The grilled mackerel, contrary to the picture, did not come with a whole mackerel, but a mackerel fillet. This is fine. They have a disclaimer at the bottom of their menu that says pictures are for show only, and that the actual dish will not be a reflection of the picture. The mackerel was tasty, but nothing about it particularly stood out as exceptional compared to the other grilled mackerel fillets I've had at Korean restaurants. The soft tofu stew was fairly small. It was tasty, and the amount of seafood in the stew was decent given how little stew there was, but I am still struggling with the price of this. Oh. There was an egg in my soft tofu stew. That was a plus. The food in this combo I do not have a particular issue with, but the price for the food I received, I do. This combo is $11.99 at Oh Geul Boh Geul at Yonge and Finch. Sure, Gangnam Sushi gave me 5 of 6 side dishes, but so does Oh Geul Boh Geul. Actually, I think Oh Geul Boh Geul gives me more. The service is better there as well. I am thankful that our server at Gangnam Sushi refilled our side dishes, but that still doesn't justify the prices we paid.

Service here is very slow. One server taking orders, serving food, handing bills and cleaning tables is not enough, even when the restaurant isn't full. 

I will still be back for their jeongol and I do want to try their pork belly bbq ($25.99), but I will not be back for the two items we ordered this time."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Food is good. If you want both Korean and Japanese cuisine, this is the right place to go to."}
{"text":"This is a Korean / Japanese restaurant that I have ordered from Just Eats / Skipthedishes in total 3 times thus far. It's one of the only Korean restaurants that delivers to my area so I have limited choices. I have only ordered for delivery and never dined in, so this is purely based on delivery. 

First time, I ordered Soon dubu and Spicy Rice Cakes. The containers were not secure and it spilled inside of the bag. It was a mess. Aside from that, the food was average at best and nothing outstanding.

Second time, I ordered Soon dubu and Japchae. It was well packed this time and no spillage. The stew tasted a lot better this time and had more \"seafood\" in comparison to last time. Japchae was \"ok\" but I felt it was overly seasoned. 

Third time, I ordered Soon dubu and Futomaki roll (no crab meat). It arrived as ordered, packed well. The stew this time was poorly made and consisted of more \"soup\" and onions then tofu and seafood. Very disappointing. The roll was fine, no complaints with that. I mean it would be hard to mess up. 

Overall, food is ok for delivery but if it was for dine in I wouldn't bother. There are so many amazing Korean restaurants out there, this one has room for improvement. Just don't expect the same quality you would receive at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Service is poor. A group of drunken, aggressive labourers were yelling and swearing loudly. A family of five with young children were sitting close by and asked them to stop. They yelled even louder and made fun of her. They also said racist thing against \"the white people\". 

If I was the owner I would've called the cops already. Instead, the owner let the family leave. Come on. Stand up for your customers and keep it a family place. Don't let your customers be harassed by others."}
{"text":"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ZERO STARS IF THE APP WOULD LET ME. This place stole my money based on Terrible Food and Terrible Customer Service. Do Not Order From This Place. 

Now I will tell you why...we ordered delivery from this horrific restaurant using the JustEat Canada service. We spent 64 dollars on garbage. The beef in the beef teriyaki was so over cooked that it was like shoe leather and inedible as a result. The futo maki tasted like it had been sitting in a fridge overnight and I threw all but 1 roll out because it was so gross. We ordered dynamite rolls and instead got their California Rolls + Dynamite Rolls and we don't eat California Rolls which is why we didn't order them in the first place. We got about 8 California Rolls and 2 Dynamite Rolls and the whole thing went in the garbage. The balance of the sushi was like rubber and also was pitched. We found ourselves eating cereal at 10:45pm instead of the sushi we had hoped for. 

We asked for our food to be refunded via Justeats and were advised that the restaurant would not authorize a refund. Had we eaten in the restaurant you can bet we would not have paid for this garbage.

Beware of previous positive reviews as I noticed an \"under new management\" sign when I drove past recently."}
