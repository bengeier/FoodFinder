{"text":"Really confused here. This place looked so unsanitary, from their unkept bathroom to their cold \"turo-turo\" food. The choices were not great, but we thought we drove all this way, maybe their food will wow us. Womp womp, worst restaurant I have been to for filipino food. My brother could cook better than this, and thats saying something! I am not sure if the food was just sitting out too long, or it was cooked in a rush matter, but it really lacked taste. We could not finish our meal. It was horrible."}
{"text":"The best tapsilog at dasilog in town..love their sisig too..better than berto's, oriental and kusina..space is huge. No need to worry about seats."}
{"text":"The BEST Filipino restaurant in Mississauga! It is as authentic as it gets. Everything here is amazing. It's hard to pick a favourite but I'm obsessed with their sisig and garlic rice at the moment - the best in the city!  Wishing this place isn't so busy otherwise I'd be here everyday.   TIP: call ahead if you want some fresh bbq :)"}
{"text":"Coming from a Filipino, I must say the quality of food and taste at the handaan reminded me of a home cooked meal. I took my mom here, and she's the toughest critic when it comes Filipino food especially because she cooks it too and she cooks it well, and the food won her over. The prices were affordable, and the ambience was casual. My best suggestion is to try the tapsilog which is cured beef, garlic rice and egg, and it is actually breakfast which they serve all day. If your feeling for something sweet try a halo halo which is a Filipino sweet treat, shaved ice with taro ice cream leche flan beans and coconut and evaporated milk. I always love having something sweet after the savoury goodness :)"}
{"text":"For all my filipinos out there you have got to visit this place!  Their food is TO DIE FOR!!  I don't usually order filipino food because I can get it at home any time lol, but I decided to give this place a try and DAMN their food is as good as it gets.  I loved their tapsilog with the garlic rice and soup!! I definitely do recommend it if you end up here.  The sisig here is also amazing, it's so different from all the other filipino restaurants I've tried.  This place gets super busy especially during lunch hour so I do recommend you call ahead to place your order."}
{"text":"This is good ol' Filipino food in the heart of Mississauga. No fuss. No frills. None of that fusion/modern take on traditional recipes. This is food served up in Filipino homes all over the globe. We got tapsilog - marinated steak strips and fried eggs on top of fried rice. Dasilog - fried milkfish and fried eggs on top of fried rice. All at CAD$8 each. Pork belly cooked lechon kawali style is a must. Still reasonable at CAD$11."}
