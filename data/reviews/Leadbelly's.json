{"text":"This place is going to be one of the biggest go-to's in Champaign here in the near future. First off, this place is HUGE! It's a bit of an enigma: bar, arcade, restaurant, event space, and really anything else that you can think of.

They have a full bar, but their specialty is whisky and tequila and it shows. They have a beautiful display of everything that they have to offer. Their beer selection is quite solid as well. They serve a variety of different sausages (their speciality) as well as other foods. I didn't check out their food while I was there, but it smelled delicious.

There are a bunch of pool tables, dart boards, and a variety of vintage arcade games. I spoke with the owner and he said that they're set to get at least 40 more set up in the coming weeks. They also host a variety of different events: live music, trivia, and other specialty events. 

Definitely a cool place that's just getting going. In the coming months I'm sure this will be one of the hotspots in C-U for all things fun."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome.   They have the biggest vintage arcade and pinball and pool.   They have bands regularly and have excellent food and alcohol.  Vey friendly staff and don't have to wait long for your order.   Can't recommend this place enough as one of  my favorite places in Champaign-Urbana.  I have not seen anywhere that has original Super Mario arcade and vintage pinball and darts."}
{"text":"This is a brand new whiskey bar and gourmet sausage place. If whiskey is your thing then this place is the place to go. Their selection is second to none. For those interested in sampling, they do flights of up to 10.

They have a wide selection of novel gourmet sausages like duck and alligator as well as the usual suspects like brats. For the competitive, try their eating contest. If you beat the old score you can rename it.

Be aware though that this place is on the far West side of town, making it a bit of a hike from the nearest bus stop. Well worth the trip though and very bikable during the warmer months."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a place to shove a bunch of random sausages in your mouth and don't feel like going to C Street?
Have I got the place for you!
There's white sausages, dark sausages, various European sausages, wild sausages, foot long sausages, sausages sausages everywhere!
It's a serious sausage party up in this place. 
And it's not just the sausages, you can put most anything on top of it, so that the sausage that you are enjoying is unique and tailored just to your liking. 
The buns, don't get me started on the buns. If you like to have your sausage in a bun, these are some of the best buns out there. The foot long Ditka comes in a pretzel bun. Which actually tastes like pretzel. Possibly the best bun that I've eaten in a while. 
There's a huge selection of whiskey and other spirits on the wall as well. As far as I know, it's the only place in town that does a whiskey flight. And who doesn't want to have 5 different tastes of things going down their throat?
There are several pool tables, if you want to play with balls. 
Arcade games, for if you feel like handling a joystick. 
Darts, if you want the feel of a sharp tip in your hand. 
Random Trivia on Wednesday, live music on other nights. 
It's out of the way, so if you are just looking for a random hookup with some strange whiskey or a sausage, you probably won't see anyone you know... yet."}
