{"text":"Since I usually get off work late, I get pretty hungry and most places close before so I don't get much choices as to what I can consume to satiate my hunger. Heard from a friend that there was this awesome 24/7 noodle place called magic noodle and from his tone of voice, it was an awesome place to go to. Tonight I decided to go and was pretty satisfied. Ordered a large beef brisket hand pulled noodles (for only 8.99) which was super delicious and had a good consistency. What I didn't like however was their pork liver with soy sauce. It was super super dry to the place into where I had to take an immediate drink of water after each bite. Other than that this place is very nice! Will definitely come back to try out their other noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"Magic noodle is a small chain restaurant which makes hand pulled noodles.  The best part, it's open 24 hours.  The inside of this location is clean and bright inside, akin to a fast food takeaway rather than a Chinese diner.  Seating is self serve and limited because the place is busy.  The food is good although I find the flavour profile more middle of the road compared to the smaller hole in the wall places nearby.  However this is something you notice only if you live in Toronto, Vancouver etc. because we're spoiled by options.  Noodles are still good and a great option late night.  Good vegetarian options."}
{"text":"There aren't many places in the GTA to get Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles, so I'm really happy to have one not too far from home. Magic Noodle is super busy, but with rapid turnover - you can easily be in and out in 30 minutes, and you won't wait long for a table. The pulled noodles are delicious, quick, and reasonably priced, but I can't say as much for the other offerings.  The meat bun (meat burger?  sliced meat with sauce in a bun) didn't have much meat, and the sauce was overpowering.  Come to think of it, all of the non-noodle dishes were a little short on the meat, and felt overpriced. That said, I have and will again come back for the excellent noodles, but probably not anything else."}
{"text":"Place was nice but a bit too bright but I  loved the squid, it had really yummy spices and it was spicy hot. I also had the small soup which was good and I didn't have that bloating feeling after I was done. Will definitely go back with friends."}
{"text":"My friend loves going there. So, I'm most obliged to go there when he craves for hand-pulled noodles. He thinks it's the best in town"}
{"text":"I visited the Magic Noodle with my friend because of the high popularity of this restaurant among the Chinese community. However, I was very disappointed.  Service  Service was slow and impolite. We had to ask two times to get a menu. After we placed our order, we waited for almost one hour. I kept on thinking that it took that long because the noodles were hand-made and it was dinner time. Then I realized that the tables beside us were getting their food. After talking to the waitress, it turned out that they forgot to send our order to the kitchen...... No one apologized or anything.   Food The noodles, honestly, was only average. The soup was very watery and the noddles were under-cooked. (Maybe they were trying to rush our order because they forgot about it, then undercooked the noodle). The tofu skewers were very tasty. We put down two orders but for some reason they only gave us one.   Cleanliness I thought I'd comment on this. The place is quite small, but it didn't appear that clean. The floor and the table were very sticky and disgusting.   In short There's nothing really special about this place. Not worth going / going back...."}
{"text":"Their noodles are hand made (you can watch the chefs chopping everything up!) but a bit too strong on flavoring. The place is usually packed with people."}
{"text":"i go there a lot and i always have the traditional beef noodle (the one on the first page) i've never tried anything else yet but that traditional noodle is the BEST, even though the restaurant is not upscale the noodle there is fantastic !"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. Ordered beef noodles and pork gamo. As a person coming from northern china, I found the gamo made here was barely a decent gamo, more or less just some leaven dough with very little pork stuffed. And it took about 20 mins for them to serve the gamo, when I have almost finished my noodles. And what's with the waiters' cold attitude to their customers? I hardly felt I was welcomed.  An average place to have a bite of Chinese food with reasonable price. Far from a place to have a decent meal."}
{"text":"I had menu order 201.. so so as the think noodles soaked up the soup and the pork was on the dry side.  Stick with the hand pulled noodle and brisket, a skewer of lamb, and leek pancake.  Well priced but be ready to wait at least 15 to 30 mins."}
{"text":"Ordered two braised beef brisket hand shaved noodles takeout. They made both wrong with no season in the soup. It tasted like water."}
{"text":"I was in the area with my friends and we were looking for restaurants that were still opened at 3 AM. This was one of the only places opened in the plaza, so we figured we would give it a try. Boy was I ever glad we did!   I tried the hand cut noodles with beef brisket. It was amazing. It had plenty of flavour and  the portion size was super generous. What I liked most however was the tofu skewers I'm not usually a tofu fan, but they were the best tasting tofu I've ever had.   However, I wouldn't recommend it for large groups as seating was a bit tight. If you're looking for a quick bite, this is it!"}
{"text":"I want to get the bad out. The customer service is scary so I recommend to go during non peak hours.  This is a northern Chinese restaurant so expect cumin in almost everything and that's exactly what I want during fall and winter. There's nothing like bold spices to warm the soul. Just like other yelpers,  go with the beef brisket. Now that it's summer get the lamb and tofu skewers with a cold beer."}
{"text":"This place was packed when I went on a Monday afternoon.  I got the house special noodles and the noodles were very fresh.  You can see the chef making noodles fresh from the dough.  My only complaint is that the sound echos through the entire restaurant every time the chef slams the dough."}
{"text":"GROSS FATTY MEAT. DUNK IN A BOWL OF MSG AND NOODLES THAT NEVER BREAK APART.   The meat was such a turn off. Whatever cheap eats but still. The noodles were the only thing tolerable. I just feel like they should improve the quality of their meat and maybe raise the price a little? Overall it was okay. The broth was whatever.  My boyfriend and I came around 6pm. The place was slammed. We called and they said there was no wait for 2. Yeah okay, Lairs. Then we were told the wait was for 10mins. We waited for 30mins.   Once we for seated, we were rushed to order. Can u flipping believe it?! So much for dining experience."}
{"text":"The clear broth was alright .. Average amount of MSG. I had their signature noodle. There was too little meat :(   Will I go back? Probably not. But if you like noodles then you must try this place."}
{"text":"I finally got a table in this restaurant!!!  and it was well worth the wait.  the noodles here are prepared fresh and they are delicious.  soup, toppings, side orders were all very well prepared as well.  the only issue i have, is the price.    a small bowl of noodles will run you $7.99 while a large one will be $8.99.  the amount of meat you get, in my opinion, is less than average.  but i have to say, the freshness of the noodles will make up for the lack of meat.  i ordered the spring noodles (where the chef slices noodles into the pot) with beef brisket.  as sides, we ordered the shredded beef bun and spring onions in bun as well.  both were made fresh to order and no complaints at all.  will i come back... yes.  have to try the fresh hand pulled noodles.  the table across from me ordered the pork chop with fried egg, which looked amazing.  can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Noodles were amazing but the beef was really jelly like... like eating brown colored fat."}
{"text":"- Didn't go to Magic Noodle for awhile, compare to the Scarborough location, you can find seats at Richmond Hill location easily - Taste good, but not as flavourful as before - Price - reasonable - Recommend their BBQ skewer items"}
{"text":"Food comes fast and tastes okay. Not expensive and it's 24hr so if you're looking for a late night snack/dinner in Scarborough this is the place to go. However, the restaurant is small and the tables are very close to each other so don't expect to have much personal space. Also, don't expect to have any service.. They don't really care about you after serving you the food."}
{"text":"Prices were pricey for a tiny bowel of noodles,  service takes forever during full house.  All staff assume you speak Mandarin. Only thing they have going is that good place to eat for late night snack.  Otherwise,  this place is meh."}
{"text":"They only accept debit for meals over 20 dollars. No credit either. So come with cash when you want to eat their disgusting low grade meat."}
{"text":"This place gets very busy around dinner time, there was a bunch of people waiting in line when we got there. Luckily, we were a group of 2 so we got seated right away by the entrance. I got a small 101 which is their beef noodle and had tofu skewers on the side. The hand pulled noodles were definitely very tasty! The only complaint I have is that it comes with very little meat (3 small slices of beef) so I was pretty much eating plain noodles. The soup base was pretty good, not overly salty. The tofu skewers are coated in a very thick sauce which can be a little overpowering, but I quite liked it and it went well with my noodles.  Overall, this is a good choice if you're in the mood for noodles and is a nice alternative to pho and ramen if you've been having too much of that recently! I would come again, but try to get there early to avoid line ups."}
{"text":"Love the food here! This is one of our favourite places for noodles. This restaurant is always busy during peak lunch/dinner time, but we arrived early for dinner one evening and didn't have to wait for a table.   We ordered:  - Steamed chicken with hot sauce: The sauce is super delicious - peanut-y and quite spicy! It has a numbing affect on your tongue so beware if you can't eat too spicy! - Grilled tofu: They douse the tofu in seasoning but it's sooo good.  - Signature beef soup noodle: This bowl comes with a bit of everything (beef, lamb, pork, egg,  turnip), and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The soup base has enough flavour but they provide chili oil on the side if you want a bit of a kick to it.  - Szechuan style fried sliced noodle: The sliced noodle works really well in a fried dish but it's quite a challenge to pick up with chopsticks. This dish was cooked in a tangy and slightly spicy sauce with a chockful of celery, onions tomatoes and meat. Yum!   Magic Noodle is a cost effective and quick place to eat (quick provided that you don't have to wait too long), but don't expect great service here. The waitresses literally drop off your food without even a blink of an eye at you. At least it's quite entertaining to watch the noodle chef at work!"}
{"text":"Before choosing to eat here, simply look at the cleanliness of the kitchen, bathrooms, dining area, and entrance. The leaking pile of garbage in front of the \"restaurant\" on the street is also disgusting. The open dish of dirt at the front counter is atrocious. It is curious as to why they do not accept credit cards. The blaring music makes conversation impossible. There is not a liquor licence. They are rarely busy, as smart people do not eat here."}
{"text":"Large size soup is tooo small Ordered extra serving of meat but it was all fat Got 3 extra pieces of beef This just wasn't enough food I'm about to go buy a burger I'm still hungry as fo Got beef noodle soup Broth had so much grease floating on top from being cooked with all that meat fat Did not get a side of vegetables Better to just buy Ramen noodles and make soup at home"}
{"text":"food was ok. but i saw the noodles chef used his phone and didnt wash his hands before making noodles"}
{"text":"The food was good and noodles excellent...BUT customer service was HORRIBLE!!! They forgot an order from our group but did not acknowledge it. They kept telling us the item was coming but we had to keep reminding them. We told them that ok fine we will take it but wanted it to go. They still served it to us but were annoyed and angry when we told them that we had asked for it to go instead. We would eat there again but NOT DINE IN. Customer service is basically non-existent here. I don't know if you have to be rude to get any service but this place is only good for take-out."}
{"text":"Good value, a small noodle already has lots of stuff in it not just a few bits of meat.   Don't get the thin noodle. I find it was too soft. Regular is just right.  The pork knife sliced noodle was really good.  It is hand pulled noodles so don't expect the noodles to be uniform.  If going for lunch arrive around 1 to avoid waiting too long."}
{"text":"We went to Magic Noodle because of my friend's recommendation, she said that they have good noodles etc.   We went three times in 3 weeks between March to April  and our experience went from very good to \"no thank you, I won't be back\" .  Why? It is all about service ....  The firs time we went was a Saturday at lunch.. We ordered the original and lamb noodles. The table as well set up with their spare bowls and ready to drink water jug which I found a delight in a CHinese place.   Even though it was busy, the food was great and the noodles were definitely home made with a great broth. On the Menu, it said that you may ask for additional broth for no charge. Being a broth lover, I asked for some and it came promptly with a smile in two small bowls (yes, this is the service differentiator ) ... The servers were polite and I thought that this would be my best find in Richmond hill, and saved me time to go downtown.   The second time we went was a mid week and they were not too busy. We ordered the BBQ lamb skewer. And 2 bowls of noodles. This time, we had no bowls on our table and we had to ask for water. It went okay with the food being delivered. When we asked for additional broth, they gave us a look and grudgingly took OUR bowls which we were using to eat , and brought it to the kitchen and poured broth on it.  We looked at each other and found it odd that they would take a customer's bowl (saliva and all) and pour broth on it.  York region health inspector would have a field day!  So this was our odd experience.   The third experience was worse. It was an icy April evening and they were not that busy. They sat us near the front where the cold air just blew through ..we figured that they probably had reservations for other customers but I observed that they would let their mandarin speaking customers to pick their seats.  We were too hungry to worry about little things but again they would bring spare bowls for the mandarin speaking customers and we had to ask for them. The KICKER was when we asked for the broth. The sever said that they do not offer it even though it was still listed in their menu. Really?  What a crock of lies!  So we ended up eating oir food and vouched never to return...  Unless you are mandarin speaking, don't come here. They don't want our service and man, don't ask for the free broth."}
{"text":"Good soup and fresh noodles. Fast pace restaurant and constant line ups so be prepared."}
{"text":"Number one traditional Chinese noodle. It taste good. I love this place. I think this place better than Big Beef Bowl. Last time I went to Big Beef Bowl, I saw that guy forgot wash his hand before pull the noodle! He doesn't care about customer's health! And I found there is human's hair in the noodle. So disgusting...."}
{"text":"Great noodles, but as the other yelpers mentioned, they don't give much meat.    We got here just after 11am on a Sunday and got the last table. It gets busy here.    If I had to stand in line just to wait for noodles, I probably won't come here.  There is another restaurant nearby where I do not have to wait and I know I can get a consistent, satisfying meal."}
{"text":"This is me returning for dinner this time to find out if there is still 'Magic' in those noodles. I didn't want to eat at Chako, so I decided to come here again. When I arrived around 6:30pm it was a quarter full. Within 20, it filled up. This place is open 24/7 as well.  I got the 'Dumpling Noodle Soup w/ Dragon bone'. I dunno what a Dragon Bone is, so I didn't want it. I asked for more dumplings! It came out pretty quick, maybe less than 5 mins. I also got two steam buns with meat. One pork and chive. Second was leeks and meat for 99 cents each.  Soup noodle was alright. I can see the guy doing the fresh noodle is actually pretty hard labour work. The noodles are not my fav, but its different from eating ramen noodles for sure. The steam buns were ordinary. I like it how you can order individually.  I would come back again in the future, bc the hours are nice. The service is just drop the food and leave you alone, until they need the table, then they looking for someone to kick out (not really doing it) but giving you the stare down.  Food cost: $12.50 before tips. Pretty good in the pocket books."}
{"text":"This place never fails to disappoint me with their fresh hand made noodles along with their extremely fast service! Can be quite busy during lunch and dinner, don't be surprised if you end up waiting outside"}
{"text":"Loooove this place!  Always on the look out for fantastic new noodle places.  The noodles are hand made before your eyes and serve as soon as they're cooked in a flavourful and hearty broth.  Portion size is perfect but for those with a heartier appetite (or who have to share with little ones), you can add on extra noodles for just a dollar more.  Try the sides -- they're surprisingly tasty! No wonder this place is always packed."}
{"text":"I just had a satisfying lunch at Magic Noodle (Lanzhou beef noodle soup). It's the downtown location of the nascent chain of the same name with locations in the suburbs. The noodles were expertly pulled and cooked to order and thus have that addictive chewy texture. Another good sign is that the soup does not have any alkaline after taste, which unfortunately plaques too many noodle/ramen shops. The portion was also very good. Only complaint is that while the soup is authentic tasting, it is too salty and has perhaps just a little too much MSG, characteristic of Chinese mainland noodle soups. A little less heavy handed and it'd be perfect. Will return and rate again."}
{"text":"Their noodle soups are absolutely amazing. I'll always come back for the food here but the 2 star rating is for the absolute horrible service I get every time I come. Servers regularly mess up on orders, they never come by to check in, servers have also spent time sitting around and chatting with one another, many times they have done that and it takes me forever just to get some ones attention to get my bill. Also, I live close by here and like I said I mainly come for the amazing noodle soups but be aware, like many occasions, they will close an hour earlier unexpectedly even though it states they close at 11. This is very sad as I come back all the time for the food but am very disappointed with the service I get all the time, really needs some changes in the way they manage their employees and the restaurant."}
{"text":"Bi weekly visit to this place for last year. Best prices and loved the shaved noodle. Beef soup base is great!"}
{"text":"Noodles are average but worth the price. The skewers are amazing though and you should try all of them. They are also open 24 hours. That's super convenient for everyone since that's almost unheard of for a non fast food place."}
{"text":"Great price and great home made noodles are very authentic.  Sends me back to China every time. I recommend this restaurant a lot and get some of their appetizers like the chinese bao."}
{"text":"THIS IS HONESTLY THE PLACE TO GO... after work. It's opened 24 hours! Since I get off work at 11pm, this is honestly the place I go to.  Don't expect too much space because they tried to cram everyone into their small restaurant. I don't personally mind it too much. Their noodles and snacks are pretty good, I haven't been disappointed \"yet\" in terms of their food. They have a chef handmaking noodles which I enjoy watching. Their food has quite the MSG in it and is somewhat oily (which I don't really prefer) but nonetheless it has my praise."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time for lunch. Was excited to try the food after seeing the menu as most of them sounds great. But it all goes downhill from there. First off, customer service wasn't great. Most of them were busy chatting and not serving. Even though there was no line up, but ppl that came in had to wait for them to get seats as their back were facing them.   We ordered 2 noodles and a few small dishes. Noodles were not bad but nothing spectacular. The intestines we orders, part of the dish went bad. The top few pieces  tasted fine, but as we get to the bottom, it has a creamy consistency. Definitely not part of the sauce.  From that point on I didn't really want to eat anymore and wanted to leave. Who knows what else I ate are cooked with food that went bad.  I guess the only up side to this place is they open 24hr. But regardless, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Despite some negative reviews here we had a good experience there. Parking is not a problem and the place is very easy to find. The place was crowded when we got there and we occupied the last table left. It was a good one just in front of chef preparing the dough - such a spectacle! The food was really good and brought to the table quickly.  I ordered the small bowl and it was more than enough food to me."}
{"text":"First time eating here and we had a table of  6, 2 of us have been here for lunch service before. Food came out fast and hot, and I made the mistake of ordering the thickest noodles in the menu, my fault for ordering the thickest noodles and not being able to read Chinese off the menu.....but the size of the noodles were the size of Lasagna noodles, just wish the menu could've explained it better of if our waitress could have educated us at table side.  1 beef roll in the aluminum foil, 3 lamb skewers, 1 noodle with shrimp main, 1 wonton noodle soup, 2 beef special noodle soup, 1 wonton and dragon knuckle soup and 1 braised beef noodle soup - except for the last order, everything had the curry flavour to it, menu has goods not as advertised, better they change the name of the restaurant to Magic Curry Noodle.  They won't be getting my money anytime soon as I have concerns that any other dish I will be ordering in the future will taste like curry.....only good when I want to order curry for when I feel like eating curry"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early dinner on recommendation.  Friendly staff, seated quickly.  Nom nom chicken not bad... cold dish of chicken with their own spicy oil/sauce.  Signature house noodles a bit disappointing... one piece of lamb, one small piece of pork chop, some slices of beef... noodles were ok.  Best was the lamb skewers... big flavourful chunks of lamb that were tasty and not overly done.  Only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for noodles. We tried the pot belly with ribbon noodles, and it was great! The braised pork was tender and flavourful and the noodles were nice too. We also tried the magic, and it was pretty good also. One of the best ones was pigplant stew. The meat was perfect and the eggplant was flavourful. For dessert we tried the sweethearts, and they were warm, as if they were freshly cut, and tasty. It is too bad they have removed it from the menu. Overall this is pretty nice. P.S. Check their website for details on how the owners were inspired."}
{"text":"2.5 star, noodle is not bad.. I like their in-house make noodle , but soup and snack is not that ??.  Service is kind of slow."}
{"text":"Feb 2016 - Work lunch Magic Noodle Signature Beef Soup Noodle Sm $7.99 Standard Noodle was good - Ok due to rest of dish being unimpressive, especially meat.  http://www.magicnoodle.ca/magic-noodle.html#anchor-u11424"}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the one in Scarborough.  Bigger, not as crowded, better service. I would not go back to the one in Scarborough because of bad services This one I might"}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl of beef noodles , texture of noodles is great but we only got 3 little piece of beef in a big bowl..disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant a few times and decided to give a review on how I think of the food and the service. The food was okay , nothing spectacular but I suppose it is good place to fill up the belly when it is so late. The service though, I have to say I was not satisfied. The waitress that was serving our table , she seemed very rush although she shouldn't be consider there weren't many customers. I hope the restaurant will realize that  building up  good relationships with customers is also important,it is not just about putting the food on the table."}
{"text":"There have been many Lanzhou style noodle restaurants popping up over the GTA in the past while. Magic Noodle has been here for a few years and is open for 24 hours, with a decent sized sitting space. I have been here many times, trying different items such as the magic lamb, the triple b, and recently the pot belly.   For all of these, the main weakness is the portion size of the meat and the soup. Each dish gives you a few pieces of lamb or beef, with the pot belly being significantly better but still not above average. The stock that they use lacks flavour from the meat and tends to be a bit too salty, and the chili oil isn't spicy enough.   That being said, the hand pulled noodles are still very great as well as the daoxiaomian, which I prefer because there tends to be more noodles in each bowl. I have not found any decent replacement as of yet, which I will update you on in the future. If you are around this area Magic Noodle is worth trying out."}
{"text":"I ordered their hand pulled noodle with beef. It tasted very good. I will order extra beef next time cause there isn't much to begin with. I ordered a small size and it came with a lot of noodles. I also ordered friend pancake with green onion. Tasted good but needs more green onion. The pork intestine with soy sauce was hard. Their pork intestine is prepared like grounded up pork and fat and sliced like deli meat. Will not be ordering it again. Service is like typical Chinese restaurant. You always have to try to get someone's attention to order, ask for more things and bring the bill. McNicoll location was extremely busy."}
{"text":"I love the hand pulled noodles here, I came her for lunch time and it was filled with people! The broth is very flavourful. They give plenty of noodles. I got the beef brisket noodles and the green onion pancakes, the pancakes were a little oily though, but still good and crispy.  The staff is very busy so it isn't that great, they are usually short of staff."}
{"text":"This place is only good if you go out very late and looking for somewhere open late to eat. Food was below average, this place is called magic noodle so obviously i would think the noodles must be really good, it was honestly below my expectations. I was shocked that i enjoyed the lamb skewers more than i enjoyed the noodles.  It is loud and packed in there. We had a table for 6 and they made us squish in a tiny little table that only fits 4 people.."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Chinese noodle soup. It has a good variety of selection for both noodles and side dishes and very reasonable pricing. My favourite dish is the Magic Noodle which comes with beef, lamb, grilled chicken, and fried egg. All the proteins tasted good and tender! Those freshly made hand-pulled or hand-shaved noodles were definitely a perk! Soup base tends to be salty, so I usually don't drink them."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant on Harbord Street, lots of noodle selections along with hot and cold appetizers.   Taste is pretty good for the price and the restaurant is nicely decorated.   So if you feel like having a bowl of noodle around this area, drop by! It is nothing special to write about but it is pretty decent with a good value."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, decided to check this place out late night because not much else was open. The skewers were good (equivalent to those you can get at pacific mall or night market), but wasn't a big fan of the broth. Both my friend and I felt it was a bit too oily and were a little queasy on the ride home."}
{"text":"Service was non existent. Waited for 35 minutes after ordering and still no food. Almost everyone who came after us had received their food within 10-15 minutes of ordering. The one server made no attempt to check up on us until we decided to leave. I'm sure the food would've been decent but the service was just terrible."}
{"text":"Amazing Braised Beef Noodle Soup in town! Myself and a couple of friends went on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was very busy so we knew we came to the right place!!!!   We each order a large braised beef noodle soup which was about $8 per bowl and the portions were big.... The soup base was perfect and I wanted more spicy so I added there fried garlic chilly sauce and it was so damn good!   5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap and fast. Loved watching the hand pulled noodles being made. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Tuesday afternoon and it was packed. They serve some delicious spicy stir fried noodles. I complimented the main dish with their unique \"Nom Nom\" chicken starter. I also tried the kebabs which were well cooked. Quick efficient service and reasonable priced, tasty food. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Tried it at afternoon, good noodles but very tough meat. Service was okay had better at Scarborough location."}
{"text":"I am a soup fanatic and this was so so awful. I had the Triple B brisket soup. The noodles themselves were good - nice and chewy. But the soup was flavourless (except for all that salt and MSG...) and the meat in the soup was pure fat, inedible. I really wanted this to be great since it's so close to where I live, but I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. My go to dish is their Triple B noodle soup. It's good. Also their beef and pork scrolls are good as well. I didn't really like the pork/beef flats. I've had their stir fry rice noodle dish but it was very oily. Did not enjoy that much and I have not had it again to see if it's changed. I would still come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is clean?noodle is fine?service is bad.Sometimes is so busy?need wait long time."}
{"text":"We ordered popcorn chicken to go and the portion was very small for the $4.99 price  My significant other wanted to give one star but the service was decent and they give you these pager things to tell you your food is ready which was a nice touch.  I would not come again given the poor reviews and the fact I'm not really in the area a lot. There are a lot better Chinese restaurants out there."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here.  I had the noodle with duck and pork.  The noodle was bland and soft.  The soup was bland as well.  I am not sure why other reviewers said this is the best noodle in town?  The beef patties were tasty though but I had tried similar ones at Markham Place foodcourt.  The place didn't look too clean.  Perhaps because there were too many people and the waitress was in a hurry to clean tables, she just sweeped things off to the floor and there is no one to mop or clean the floor afterwards.  Something that is typical in low end Chinese restaurants.  I had two little kids with me so we ate a little slow and one of the waitresses came and asked us in a rather rude manner if we were done.  I did understand that she was anxious to give the table to someone waiting but still it wasn't a pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Love their freshly pulled noodles~~  Side dishes were pretty good too~~had the peanut chicken & pork ears   Not a big fan of the service & the shaved noodles are kinda soggy~~"}
{"text":"This place is going to do REALLY well. They have a perfect blend of traditional regional Chinese dishes (pig ears! Beijing style zha jian mien!) balanced out with cute, playful names and a very modern/homey space. Chinese students at U of T will love the balance between feeling at home with the food, but still being in a trendy, updated space. There are things on the menu even my dad would like!  I tried the 102 Magic noodles. In comparison to Homemade Ramen at Dundas and Spadina, I didn't like the noodles as much, but I think based on the proximity to campus alone, I would consider coming back here. I found some of the dishes in need of more flavour - you should definitely make use of the sauces on the table (chili oil is my favourite). Service is quick, and there's complimentary lemon water."}
{"text":"I came here twice so far. On my first visit, I had to wait for at least 20 minutes before I got seated but on my second visit since I visited on a weekday I didn't have to wait. On both visits, the restaurant was incredibly packed. On my most recent, I noticed that the restaurant had installed a 24 hour sign outside-interesting concept! You get to see the chef making and pulling/ slicing the noodles in the open kitchen ( it does get loud though).  I shared the shredded beef pancakes, sizzling tofu and lamb kebab with my friend. I got the hand-pulled noodle with beef brisket- the brisket was quite tender and the broth had a bit of a kick to it. I had my noodle with a bit of the chili sauce and I have to say their chili sauce is really good! The sauce was incredibly aromatic and really complimented the beef brisket. The noodles were really good and you could tell the noodles are fresh! As for proportions, they are quite big and you could most likely share one and try more appetizers.  I found the shredded beef pancakes to be lacking-it was a bit dry and just underwhelming. However, the sizzling tofu and the lamb kebab were both absolutely delicious. The sizzling tofu was savoury and wasn't bland at all. Out of all the lamb kebabs I have had before this one was one of the better ones- the meat wasn't dry and the fat made the meat really flavourful.   I can't say much for the service as it wasn't really existent, I can't say I was expecting it either. We got our order pretty quickly. And when we asked for the bill, they were able to get the bill back to us quite quickly and we didn't have to wait long at all.  *Tip* Bring the receipt and pay at the front!"}
{"text":"Fast, simple and delicious noodles in North York! The chicken friar was off the hook. Broths and soups were quite good too if that's what you're after. This place is also open 24 hours which is awesome."}
{"text":"I was debating with my love, should be 3 or 4 stars.   We decided a 4 because: - handmade fresh noodles right in front of you, kids had fun watching it & laughed every time when the guy pulled the noodle & hit the board making a loud bam bam bam...  - chewy texture of the noodle, some like it & some don't.  For us, it was perfect, we usually ate after the kids so after the noodle soaked into the broth a while; not too hard & chewy lol... So for those who don't, ask to cook the noodles a bit longer otherwise wait few minutes like us.   - I personally didn't like their soup base, a weird/ unique after taste.  I ended up finished the dry noodles with black bean sauce.  I wish they would give a bit more sauce.    We didn't like the sweet potato cakes, too doughy but they were in heart-shaped, had to try them :) we will not order it again.    - pancakes: green onion & in beef/pork, the pancake itself was in flaky side.    We went right at 11 when they just opened & long line up at around 11:30.    Service was good; the girls were nice.    We will go again & will try more of their snacks."}
{"text":"I've been to Magic Noodle on 4 separate occasions, each of them were not amazing but the most recent visit was downright abysmal so I felt compelled to Yelp my experience.  If you're looking for the short version, basically, the service was so awful to the point where I left them no tip whatsoever. If you want to know all the details, continue reading.  It started with the waitress who seated us. She looked so miserable and bitchy; not a hint of a smile. That doesn't usually bother me as I'm sure everyone has had a bad day but it definitely doesn't help when you're dumb as nails.   We proceed to order. I wanted to get their pork chop noodle soup but I wanted their \"sliced\" noodle instead of the \"hand pulled\" version; their pork chop option only appeared under the \"hand pulled\" section. I requested if I could get it with sliced noodle instead and she immediately shot that down with \"No.\". I gave her this look of disbelief so she proceeded to say \"We don't substitute. It's too much work for the kitchen.\" Too much work to use the other batch of noodles?!  The next annoyance was when she started to take my wife's order and then all of sudden she stopped listening to her during mid order as something or someone apparently said something that caught her attention. She turns around and stares at something for about 10 seconds and then decides to come back to finish taking the order. No apology or anything.  We were sitting in the booth in the front corner of the restaurant and adjacent to us were 2 small tables used for a table of 4 and at the time occupied. When that table of 4 left, they had to seat 2 parties of 2 so they decided it'll be cool to separate the tables and leaving less than a foot between all 3 tables. It shouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that my wife was (8 month) pregnant and it would have been impossible for her to leave the table now, aside from having the adjacent table lift and move their table aside with all their food on it, which we ended up having to do.  For our beverages we asked for 3 glasses of water and one tea. The waitress apparently has such a lack of common sense that she thought it'll be ok to bring the glasses to us by carrying them in one hand with 3 of her (dirty) fingers on the inside part of the glass clamping them together. At this point, I was certain the waitress had the IQ of a peanut so I asked another waitress to get us 3 other glasses and explained don't bring them holding them like the previous waitress, as I demonstrated. They had no more glasses though (facepalm). Oh yeah, the tea never came.  The final thing I'll say about the service was when we paid, I noticed they over charged us one of their steam buns ($0.99). We ordered 4 but returned 3 of them because they were raw (yes, what a night). They had the tenacity to argue saying we ordered 4 - which we did - and we returned 2, to the point that the waitress called over the other 2 waitresses and all 3 of them had to discuss this. It got to the point when I just said, \"I don't care. Its 99 cents. Get on with it and let me pay!\" I paid and left them not a cent as a tip.   Now for the food. Like I said earlier, I've been here several times so I've tried several of their items.   Their hand pulled beef brisket had good noodles and the broth was flavourful, however, I don't remember counting 2 good pieces of beef I actually ate. All the pieces were huge chunks of fat or tendon.  Their hand pulled lamb noodle had a clear broth, and like the beef brisket, had good noodles. Unfortunately, also like the beef brisket, the choice of meat they chose to serve is ridiculous. Lots of bone, little meat, and lots of inedible pieces. The broth was also very oily.  Their steam buns were very good the first time I ordered them. Flavourful and moist, but the more recent time, as already mentioned, raw. So obviously they have a consistency issue with this item.  Green onion pancake should just be called.. Pancake. Very little to no green onion, basically.  The meat used for the lamb kebab is such low quality that it has a very gamy flavour. It was like eating mutton."}
{"text":"Hand cut noodles with pork was great!  The pork had a nice toasted / fried texture, noodles were perfect with a generous portions.  Lamb with hand pulled noodles soup was excellent as well.  The lamb broth was so tasty!  The bbq tofu was very unique, tofu was cut thinly and skewered.  It had a light soy/BBQ sauce, it was great.  The vermicelli and egg grilled buns were good.  The only downer was the buns of the grilled beef buns were a bit dry.  If you like noodles and plenty of side dishes, a great place to go!"}
{"text":"I live around yonge and finch, and I was a big fan of their Scarborough location. I always drive all the way there to line up for their delicious noodle.  I was so happy to have it so close to my home. The first time, I ordered Uber. it was not good, the noodle are so hard, even tho they separate the noodle and soup.   I figured it better to eat fresh, so I went in their store. The store was simple and small. The services was only okay. I went into the store 10:55am and the waitress was looking at screen seems busy. So I waited. When I order at exact 11am she told me I past the breakfast hour...  The food is decent, a bit salty. And somehow is not as delicious as the Scarborough one. But overall, still a good Chinese noodle place in yonge and finch"}
{"text":"I would give a half star if I could. I have been to this establishment a couple of time, and the customer service is FAR Off from SUB-PAR. I am Chinese, so I am accustomed to the Asian style of customers service (but this dining experience was just rude). The cashier shot me a nasty a** look to pack a sandwich to go (we got like 5 items). Magic noodle management: We were here January 11th, 6 am in the morning."}
{"text":"I have been to this place like a couple of 100 times!! Lol. I am a skewer lover and I really like the skewers (specifically - lamb and beef tenon) here. I love that this place is open all the time - in the description it says 24/7! Whenever I have a late night party or work, I end up here for food! This place is always crowded. The servers are friendly and the place itself though small does not feel too uncomfortable. A couple of times, my friend and I had to share a table with another couple. That's fine with me coz they ask you at least if we mind. When you are in this place, you eat and leave! Ofcourse you can take longer and sit and chat. But me being me, I feel bad for the people lining up to be seated !  They have a lot of noodle soup options as well. I usually jus stick to a noodle soup and couple of my favorite skewers! You can also choose the thickness of your noodles. The best part is it's freshly made in the kitchen which is visible to the public's eye. So there you go, you have entertainment too here ! The price is also very reasonable as well, if you order reasonably lol. All in all, a great place to contently eat and have a good time with friends.  I must mention that they take only cash or debit. No credit cards.   Signing off,  LW"}
{"text":"Great little space; nicely decorated, and you can watch the chef make noodles by hand which is kinda cool.  Portions are good and taste is on point. I got the Magic Lamb, which I really enjoyed. My friend got the Magic Beef, which he said was quite good and authentic. Good amount of meat and the broth was delicious. We also ordered lamb skewers which had a nice amount of spice and were very good, albeit slightly chewy.  Only downside is the service. Waitresses were unenthusiastic and slightly rude. I'd still come back for the food though!"}
{"text":"Came with friends, we had Triple B and pigplant stew, the triple B is very good, but the pigplant is kind of weird."}
{"text":"Tried coming to this place on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed so I decided to come back another day. I come back today on a Monday night and I still had to line up! The 3 of us ended up squeezing into a 2 person table because we didn't want to wait much longer.  Ordered fried pancake with leeks, pork bun, cow tongue in wrap and the hand pulled noodles with lamb.  The leek pancake was done well - the stuffing was not too salty and the pancake was not over fried.   Pork bun and cow tongue wrap was average. Nothing special.  Hand pulled noodles - it was ok, the lamb chunks were slim pickings and the noodles weren't as chewy as I had liked, despite it being freshly made. The soup broth had a hint of cumin or something non-Chinese tasting and a little oily.   Overall, this place wasn't bad. The only thing I would come back for is the fried pancake with leek. I've had better hand pulled noodles and broth in some other places in Markham and Chinatown."}
{"text":"Good chewy noodles! Portions kinda small for the price. Enjoyed it but am not rushing back for more either"}
{"text":"Very bad service and food.  Service - the attendant was not helpful at all when i was making my order. I asked her questions but her answers were short and curt, as if telling me to hurry up already. Then the same attendant didn't bother cleaning our table even when she saw us wiping it with tissue. I don't know what she was busy with, the place only had five customers that time.   Food - i ordered the make-your-own noodles with beef broth, beef short ribs and bokchoy. It came out with two pieces of meat on it. I asked if it was really supposed to be two pieces, they came back saying it should be three and gave me a piece of meat on a bowl. Didn't even had the courtesy to apologize and give more than a piece additional.   To top it off, I swear the soup had msg on it!!!   Terrible experience and waste of money. Won't ever come back!"}
{"text":"What happened here!? It earned the second star for becoming a 24hr restaruant while keeping up their fast service but other than that, SERIOUSLY, what happened here?!  Prices range between $6.50 - $15 per bowl of noodle depending on the type and size you order. A small will fill you up with the addition of side dishes and appetizers ranging from $2 - $6 per dish.  When Magic Noodle first opened thier broth had depth and their noodles had a bounce back to your bite. Maybe it was because we went at 7AM or they've just lost their touch but their richest broth (beef brisket) tasted like watered down beef water when we had it the other day. Had to add spicey chilly, vinegar AND soysauce to my soup for SOME flavour in the dish.  The beef brisket roll was once a filling size (easily could be considered a meal on it's own) with delicious seasoned meat to wrap ratio. Our roll the other day was bite size pieces with a thin layer of beef. The seasoning still tasted the same...I think... but there was too little brisket to tell.  1/5 for food 2.5/5 service (it's more of an in & out place rather than enjoy your time)  If it's 4AM with nothing else opened I'll consider a revisit. Else, I'll wait the few extra hours for Jim Chai Kee to open next door for my cheap noodle fix."}
{"text":"Did a few take out here as it close to yoga studio.  Services: pretty bad, the girl there were so in patient. Food: really good. 2 person take out around 32$"}
{"text":"Noodles are fresh and chewy but the broth was weak and not hot  Atmosphere is clean and bright  Step it up Magic Noodle there area million noodle shops in the area"}
{"text":"Came here for my friends birthday and absolutely loved it. Cozy little place, they're open 24/7 and the price range is reasonable. Noodles are fresh and handmade per order. The broth is tasty and their dishes warm your belly. Especially great during the colder seasons. Portions are filling, they have 2 sizes of bowl options small and large. However, the difference in size isn't that significant but I've never needed to order a large considering their Ramen Bowls are very filling. Service is also very quick. Atmosphere does get busy though. Highly reccomend and will be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Good tasty noodles... I got the first one on the menu I guess that's their signature dish? It had beef, lamb, pork, eggs and vegetables.  It's not spicy unless you add in the spicy oil.   But you have to try the lamb skewers they are the bomb!"}
{"text":"An underwhelming meal, saved only by the \"tentacle\".  Tree hugger soup was underwhelming - I liked the texture of the noodles but the broth was too plain.  My partner had the Beijing Bang and the portion was quite small. He said it tasted \"very ok\" and he had trouble finding any of the minced pork in his dish.  We redeemed the night by ordering the mysterious, non-descript \"tentacle\". The squid had just the right amount of flavour and spice, was quite tasty. Would only return for a noodle dish full of tentacle."}
{"text":"We always come here late night as they are open 24/7. The restaurant has around 20 small tables. They are usually full, even late at night. The mainly serve noodle bowls and side dishes. They make the noodles in front of you. And you are given the selection of extra thin noodles to curtain flat noodles. The prices for these noodle bowls are very reasonably priced. I tried the lamb, beef, and beef brisket. The lamb was okay, nothing special. The beef noodle bowl is what keeps us coming back. Their soup is flavorful, noodles are decent."}
{"text":"PSA: There was a grasshopper in my soup.   This happened at least half a year ago and I swore to myself to never go back there again. I went with my family to eat here and we each ordered a bowl of noodles and some sides, including the leek and vermicelli in a pancake, and tofu skewers.  The leek and vermicelli pancake thing was very good. The tofu was horrible: it just tasted like stale tofu slathered in very salty sauce.   Now, the noodles. In all fairness, I did think the soup was good and I enjoyed the texture of the hand pulled noodles. But having already taken a few bites of noodles and sips of soup to discover a whole grasshopper corpse having a dip in my broth really killed it. I mean, a fruit fly, fine. An entire grasshopper the size of my pinky though; totally unacceptable.   What shocked me the most was the attitude of the server when I politely informed her of the foreign item in my soup. She stared at me blankly and unapologetically, and bluntly asked if I wanted another one. Um, no thank you. You can have it. Enjoy the grasshopper. Keep it as a pet or something to remind you of how disgusting it is to have it float around in your meal.   Anyway, we talked to the manager and she said that the grasshopper probably came from green onions. Okay, sure. My guess was the huge pot of soup but whatever. Even so, major sanitary issues. She was more apologetic but did not offer to do anything to compensate us or make the experience better. My family had to ask to have the grasshopper bowl removed from the bill.   I am giving Magic Noodle one star because of that pancake. Otherwise I would've gave it 0 stars (if I could) because of the horrible experience. I still don't believe the grasshopper was from green onions though. It's more likely it had been brewing in the huge pot of broth (aka everyone in the restaurant got to try some of that grasshopper stew minus the grasshopper). Needless to say, I am never going back. For those of you who have yet to try it, good luck."}
{"text":"Their place is nice and clean. Their pho is good but their noodle is like instant noodle. Their specialty snakes are good. I don't like their wraps or burgers. I feel like they use the same sauce on everything. Which is the standard sweet Bbq sauce and chilli sauce. Everything tastes the same ."}
{"text":"Good place for noodles. It's worth the lineup and wait. It's one of my frequented locations for food. I personally enjoy their pork bone noodle soup, the broth is really good. And best part is they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good and the service was garbage, but now that the service has improved a bit (still not great) the food has gone downhill. The only good thing about Magic Noodle is that it's 24/7 and their lamb skewers and saliva chicken are good. However, be prepared for the big amount of msg they use in everything."}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual dinner.  My friend ordered the magic chicken and I got the magic. Both were very satisfying bowls filled with pleasantly chewy noodles and plenty of favourful, well seasoned meat. Their chili oil with sesame seeds (which they sell for $5.99 per jar) is also quite good. Will definitely be back for the food, friendly service, and budget friendly prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good . Fast service. Reasonable price. Authentic.clean. quick lunch option. Packed with Chinese. Then you know it's good."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 8/10  Conveniently located nearby a subway station, Magic Noodle is a great go-to if you're craving noodle soup.   I've seen the complaints regarding the soup flavour; I thought it was good! Hand-pulled noodles come in different sizes/widths, which is nice if you want to vary your meal that day.   Hot and cold apps are also fun to try. If you're adventurous, the pig ears are quite yummy, or if you want something more on the safe side, they have this shredded meat/bao-type app that's to die for.   Place is new so it was very clean when we went.   THE BOTTOM LINE: good food, convenient location, clean!"}
{"text":"Food is average. Nothing really special. Very small portions for their prices; I wasn't full with a bowl of noodles. Hard to find parking. I wouldn't come back unless I was really starving."}
{"text":"While the various forms of hand pulled noodles were decent (slightly better than the ones in pacific mall), the seating is really uncomfortable as they really pack the tables in there like sardines (came in on a long weekend sunday around 5:30pm).  Other dishes we tried included spicy seaweed, spicy noodle w/ tofu, broccoli and cauliflower, turnip w/ peanuts were just ok.  The pork chop in my noodles soup was too thin and dried out.  Don't think we'll be back here in awhile."}
{"text":"I'm a big sucker for hand-cut noodles and hand-pulled noodles. Not only are the noodles here 'magical', they're also perfectly chewy! You can see the chef slicing away at fresh dough to make hand-cut noodles, and another chef slapping and pulling the hand-pulled noodles.   We ordered two small bowls of beef hand-cut/pulled noodles, one beef wrap and two tofu skewers - and our bill was less than $20 after tax, sounds pretty reasonable to me!  Although I ordered Small, the noodles are very filling - I suggest ordering your noodles in small just so you get a chance to try out their other items. Tofu skewers were pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the beef wrap. Too much dough was used, with one thin slice of beef wrapped in between and no other condiments used - this dish tasted too dry and a little bland.   Service is lacking - we were not given any tea or water until we asked for it and it didn't get served till after our noodles arrived. The seats were a bit oily and we had to wipe it down ourselves - I guess they didn't have time to properly wipe down the seats due to how busy they are? If you look into the open kitchen, you'll see that there are more kitchen staff than the wait staff - this is why the food arrives at the table within minutes of ordering. However, the service outside of the kitchen is slow and I don't think the cramped restaurant can fit any more servers..   The line may appear ridiculously long, but it moves fast! If you're a party of 2, you'll be seated within 10 minutes! Aside from the slightly disappointing service, I can't resist fresh noodles at such a decent price, so yes call me a fan!"}
{"text":"The noodles were awesome, chewy and soft. I thought the broth was cooked well with great flavours. The restaurant itself is in a popular plaza with good lighting and was very clean. However the customer service was lacking. We droppped our utensils and the waitress saw but didn't come to assist us."}
{"text":"Hungry at 3AM? No problem, Magic Noodle's got you!  Open 24/7 and the noodles are to die for! Service is so-so depending how busy it is, but the servers to try.  I usually get the beef brisket noodle soup with their green onion pancake, which I'm pretty sure is frozen.   Broth is amazing and noodles are as fresh as they come! Very recommended!"}
{"text":"Magic Noodle kicks your typical noodle soup up a notch. Their broth tends to be a little oily, but is very flavourful. The handmade noodles are a must. The portions are generous and the prices are good. Bottom line - I would go back."}
{"text":"I got takeout for the shaved noodle and braised pork and they totally ripped me off. The broth was in the paper takeout container and only half full. Also, the noodles, the broth and meat were COLD. I should have took it back for refund but I was in a rush. The two pieces of veggies were all shriveled up as well...It was fine the previous few times I came here besides a small portion and lots of MSG. I won't be coming back even though it's convenient for me to come here."}
{"text":"Love the hand-pulled noodles here!!  SOOOO good!  Broth is super tasty and noodles are even and the perfect ratio of chewy vs. Soft.  My fave is the pork bone soup noodles!  Also tried the squid skewer today and it was amazing  The line ups r out the door for this place, but that's okay because their service is super efficient!  I watched them clear the line again and again with quick service, immediate clean up after guests leave and seating of new guests.  And as a bonus, this place opens late!  Till 1am!  Perfect for late night munchies! :D"}
{"text":"The magic happens again at Magic Noodles in Scarborough. I ordered \"The Magic\" which consisted of Sliced Beef, Pork Chop, Braised Lamb, Beef Tripe, Pickled Turnip, and a fried egg served over a big bowl of classic hand-pulled noodles submerged in tasty beef broth. Portions were generous and service was quick as usual. I think I was in and out of there in about 30 minutes. They have an extensive menu with a variety of dishes to choose from. If you're craving for noodles in the Scarborough area, Magic Noodles will definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person who eats a lot in one sitting now but the portions here were too much for me. I ordered the bbq buddies and enjoyed it. It comes with a good amount of meet and a lot of noodles. I got the thin noodles and liked it. My friend ordered the curtain and honestly tasted handmade. I didn't like the broth as much but the beef broth was definitely worth a try. The coconut avocado is a good smoothie will a more avocado flavour than coconut. I'd love to come back and try again. The restaurant has a cute atmosphere and they take card. The price isn't too bad either for a large portion. $10-20 range."}
{"text":"Crowded lunch service, so I came in after my friends got a table.  I ordered the lamb hand pulled noodles.  Good amount of lamb meat, and noodles are made better than the one at the Pacific Mall food court.  The soup reminded me of a traditional hot pot broth, so it felt like I was eating hot pot, which is a good thing!  Would come again, but be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEats because it was early and one of the only places available for delivery. I waited longer than expected; it took about an hour to arrive. I got the wrong order and gave it back to the driver immediately - you would think they would check first to make sure it's correct before sending the driver off. I called them back and they blamed the driver for picking up the wrong order and that there was nothing they could do. Twenty minutes later I was about to order from somewhere else, when they called back and said they could have someone deliver another order for me with extras. It was another long wait. I live pretty close so I'm not sure why it would take so long. There wasn't any extra and I'm not sure if that order was even correct. It looked different from what I imagined. The portions were extremely small and basically inedible. Not sure how the actual restaurant is, but I definitely will never order from here again, and probably won't waste my time going there either."}
{"text":"Trying to communicate with the servers here is almost IMPOSSIBLE. How does the customer communicate with the server if the servers only know how to speak chinese. Why don't you hire some employees that speak English.  Been here a few times and it's a nightmare trying to speak to the employees inside. They literally don't understand anything you say. They're quite rude as well and often show a lot of attitude.  The food is mediocre and I only come here for their kebobs. Their noodle is FAR from magic.  The crowd is mostly teenagers or students.   It's better to get takeout. I would not recommend dining in!!  Service 1 star Food 2 stars"}
{"text":"Had the house special noodles; plenty of meat and noodles.  For $8 it was very good.....both was also flavourful.  We waited about 10 min for a table to free up. Overall very satisfied with value, quality and service."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my experience at the other Magic Noodle locations in Richmond Hill and Scarborough but this location needs improvement. The service is decent for a Chinese restaurant but the food is definitely of lower quality (in comparison to the other 2 locations I've tried) and the noodles only come in one size. I usually order the Braised Pork Sliced Noodles and while the flavour is similar to other locations, the overall quality of the meat & noodles were worse. Most of their business comes from students at UofT so they probably don't emphasize food quality as much."}
{"text":"I have become addicted to the noodle soup of this place! The noodles are just like any other hand pulled noodles, however the soup is the selling point. How do I say this, I come here just for the soup LOL!   P.s. Other stuff that's good here are the skewers (ex tofu, lamb etc.) and the hot sauce. The hot sauce is just so tasty and makes my mouth water even as I write this review.   So come check this place out and enjoy their awesome endless soup!"}
{"text":"The Magic This is the house noodle. I really like the noodles because they make the noodle from scratch, from the flour. You can actually see the chef making noodles from where I am sitting. There are different types of noodles that you can select from and I chose the traditional type. The noodles are chewy and taste good. They go well with the soup. The house noodles come with pork chop, lamb, beef briskets, turnip slices, and an egg. The real noodle look different from the picture in the menu. In the picture, it shows a while piece of pork chop but when the real bowl of noodle arrives, the pork chops are in chunks and they don't look like a whole piece of pork chop.   Besides, the waiter who delivered the noodles just dropped down the noodles that we ordered at the table without telling us what kind of noodles was that and for whom. I came with friends and a couple of us ordered the same item but one with extra noodles. We could not figure out which bowl was a regular size and which one had more noodles.  Nevertheless, I like their noodles but not their services. I would come again for more noodles."}
{"text":"This location is different than the Scarborough location in that it is much bigger and more spacious but is not opened 24 hr.    There's a bar/high table seating along the back wall which is great for if you're by yourself and grabbing lunch - this is usually empty and you can bypass the huge lineups for tables.  The noodles are great here, though as always I find that the meat/noodle ratio is unsatisfactory.  There always seems to be more noodle than available meat.  However, I overlook this because i always order their side dishes - especially the lamb skewers.    I've tried all the skewers here and definitely enjoyed lamb the most.  The octopus is great too but almost impossible to share."}
{"text":"Note: The restaurant was closed for a few days back in the summer due to not passing health inspections but is now open again.  I don't see any visible upgrades or changes though.  There's always a slight wait, but as the food comes so quickly, the wait time is not too terrible.    The noodles are pretty good, though the meat-to-noodle ratio is sub-optimal.  I'd like more meat to go along with my noodles, but i guess that's their way to get you to order their side dishes.  They have a wide variety of side dishes for pretty cheap, and in particular their skewers are really good.  I've tried the beef and lamb skewers and even the fried tofu - all were right off the grill and very delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Ordered: Nom nom chicken  Magic beef soup Magic soup   The nom nom chicken was ICE COLD. I'm confused. My companion got his magic soup 15 minutes before I did. He waited and then I had to ask for what happened with my order. 15 minutes!! The finally brought my order. Felt so awkward and the place is cramped.   The soup itself was ok, noodles a good except some parts are lumpy. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant that offers delicious handmade pull and push noodle dishes.  For two people, I recommend sharing one appetizer like the spicy cold sliced meat dish and ordering two noodles dishes (one dry and one soup). This way you can try the noodles in different capacities.   The restaurant is open 24/7 which is great and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great homemade noodle restaurant. Service was as expected and all of the dishes are reasonably priced. Pretty much the same as the uptown location. Will see me here in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered the Triple B and the wife loved the noodle with fried egg, pork ears were good too! Will definitely gonna come back, cant beat the price for those fresh noodles and awesome flavors! Service was fast and generous on the servings"}
{"text":"This place is actually really good. Been here since it first opened. Their Lamb skewers and tofu skewers were delicious. Noodles was really chewy, soup base was flavorful. Now They're opened 24hrs, Which amazed me. Definitely worth a try If you're in the area"}
{"text":"My wife and i visited Magic Noodle on Sunday 11/27/2106.  It was quite packed for our first time there.  Most of the seating was occupied.  Friendly wait staff.  about the food experience.  we ordered Seafood friar noodles and Dragon Wonton noodle bowl large.  The noodle soup was very good for the price worth going back for.  I enjoyed the fresh pulled noodles..should have requested extra noodles since my wife and I shared the bowl.  The seafood friar dish (with fresh hand shredded noodles) I was hugely disappointed in.  I am unable to eat cabbage and literally 1/2 of the dish was cabbage the noodles on the dish appeared to be less than a handful overall.  There was barely 4 small pieces of shrimp and maybe like 3 small pieces of scallops.  The fresh hand shredded noodles were good along with the sauce for the noodle dish..but more seafood please and more vegetables other than just cabbage and onions.  for a dish that is at a price point of $10.99 pre-tax I would have expected more out of it.  I would probably suggest stick with the hand pulled noodle soups and skip the friar noodle dishes.  As for the Dragon Wonton Noodle soup dish, the noodles were the star of the show..the wontons were lackluster in size and the addition of the pork bones in the soup..meh..could have done without it.  Maybe next time all request to leave out the pork bones.  If you want good sized wontons with your noodle soup..would recommend elsewhere.  Would only recommend visiting here for the fresh pulled noodle soups only."}
{"text":"The noodles itself was great.  The noodles are all hand pulled and fresh.  You can actually see and hear the chefs making the noodles in the restaurant.  You'll occasionally hear a loud whomp inside the kitchen which is the chef smacking the flour onto their table while making the noodles.  On this occasion, I ordered the beef with their clear broth.  The beef was thinly sliced and the broth was nice and hot.  The noodles was cooked just right.  It was very tasty and it's definitely a noodle joint.  I also ordered panned fried onion cakes and a lamb skewer.  The onion cake was so-so and a little soggy if you ask me.  The lamb skewer was spiced very nicely with a kick and tasted just fine.  However next time I come here, I would only order a bowl of noodle...it's what it's known for.  Oh and the place was packed at 2pm on a weekday.  It's not a very big place but I was surprised to see it so busy.  People kept coming in non-stop."}
{"text":"We've been to the other locations numerous times and tried this one.  First thing we noticed is that the prices are higher than the other locations and they charge extra for the hand cut noodles.  I had the lamb noodle, tastes as good as the other locations but a bit skimpy on the meat.  There are more snack selections though.  Food is quick to the table which is good."}
{"text":"The photos and descriptions in the menu looked really good i.e. noodles packed with a huge variety of toppings. We were quite disappointed when the actual food arrived. The noodles had a good texture and a fair amount of it. There was so little of any meat and they looked like scraps. The fried egg was way overcooked. Everything looked like they drowned in the soup except there was nothing hidden. Broth was okay but nothing special. The original lamb skewer was quite good traditional cumin but a bit salty. The spicy one was too spicy."}
{"text":"Bless me up with noodles!  The Chinese provinces are taking over Ynf and no one can complain! All this culture in the span of a block leads to Sichuan, shanghai type noodles and personally the skimpy ramen joints down the block don't do it anymore.   Give me some beef brisket and hot chilli oil. Comes with handfuls of knife shaved noodles. Killer deal for under 10$!"}
{"text":"We came to Magic Noodle on a Saturday evening around 11PM. The place was quite busy but we got seated quickly. The restaurant is small and you will be expected to sit quite close to other customers. They have a variety of noodles - varying in thickness. We ordered Magic Beef and the Shrimp Wonton. The broth was delicious and flavourful, but we wanted a bit of spice and kick - so we added the chilli oil that can be found at every table. The noodles were amazing - perfect elasticity and not too chewy.  They had a number of different drinks on the menu and we opted for the coconut + avocado shake. It was delicious, creamy and smooth. You could actually taste the avocado. I would rate it 4/5.  We would definitely recommend trying Magic Noodle. Prices are decent for the portion that you get."}
{"text":"Disappointed to magic noodle in harbord st! I throw up!! Looks like they changed owner. It was a good restaurant. But now everything is terrible. The waitress has very bad attitude, I am afraid of her ugly face.   Cooking materials are not that exquisite anymore. Now their meat in noodle taste disgusting.  I start to doubt whether they have hygiene problem.    I WON'T GO THERE ANYMORE!"}
{"text":"Errr very meh. Got our order wrong. Meat was terrible. Actually there was barely any meat in our bland noodles.   Cool decor tho."}
{"text":"We were looking to eat dinner but it was already 10:30pm, so we stumbled across this 24/7 noodle spot. I believe this is the same restaurant as the one in scarborough - at Midland and McNicoll.  This is a small spot located on Yonge Street, with not too many tables for seating. This place is run a little differently from other restaurants- you pretty much order, grab a number, grab a seat, and they bring you your order.  There wasn't much servicing involved by the staff here.  I ordered #1 the Magic- it's almost like their house special where the noodle has a bit of everything (beef,chicken, lamb & fried egg). The portion here is HUGE !! I couldn't finish it, but the bowl was certainly very flavourful.   The pricing here is fair- around $8 to $9 dollars for signature bowls, there are also build your own bowls option which i didn't try.  Overall this is a nice place to stop by especially if you were hungry late night and craving for a big bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Man this place is amazing! They make all of their noodles by hand on the spot, and you'll hear the occasional bangin' from the dude stretching the noodles. The noodles always comes out doughy and chewy, just how I like it! They've got quite a variety of noodles and they are all quite delicious. But out of the many times I've been to this place I've gotta say that the lamb pulled noodles is hands down the cream of the crop. The soup base is rich and definitely the most flavourful out of all the ones I've tried.  For less than $10 a bowl definitely come and give this place a try. It'll probably be quite packed if you are trying to come at anytime during eating hours so just be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Its not amazing but the taste and texture of their noodles is good. It's ok and does the job for a company that doesnt charge a delivery fee. I'd do this again."}
{"text":"Fortune favors the bold - and I bump this place up one star for the novelty value.  I am an American Southerner. We have little to nothing that resembles this where I live. So it was very bewildering for us to visit a place with nothing but Asian Canadians speaking Mandarin.  Even so, it was no problem - the wait staff promptly sat us and brought our menus (in English). I have had more types of Asian food than most people in my home region (Americanized-Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean) but this sort of native noodle shop was a new experience.  Our orders were actually mixed up. Forgive me if I get any of the nomenclature wrong, but I ordered the standard noodle with beef while my co-adventurer ordered a shorter noodle (wide?) with bbq pork. The meats came with the wrong noodles from what I can, but we just switched bowls, no biggie.  I really preferred the taste of the short, fat noodle over the longer standard noodles. I did not like the bbq pork, but the beef was pretty good. For some reasons the cut of meat restaurants like this favor are never what I consider the \"choiciest\" bits, but that could be a cultural difference. The flavor was still very good. Frankly the whole thing reminded my of Pho, but I'm sure y'all who eat this stuff all the time could point out myriad differences.  We drank the delicious cucumber water which each table is given in a see-through plastic carafe. We also order some leek cakes as a little side dish, which came piping hot and were a novel, but good taste.  Prices were very reasonable. It was one of the cheapest and most filling meals we had in the country. Could NOT finish all those noodles. Also, wish I would have brushed up on my chopsticks skills - I made a go of it for a while but it's harder to use them on noodles than on sushi when you grew up using a fork.  One of the major pluses of this noodle shop over all the similar joints in Markham is that is NEVER CLOSES. That was dang handy for the night we returned from a drive to Niagara Falls so late the rest of Ontario was already shuttered for the night.  Bottom-line: This review, obviously, is intended more for novices than for those of you who grew up eating this stuff. Obviously I can't tell you anything about it you don't already know. But for anyone out there who might be like me, don't be scared off by the strangeness of it, the food is worth checking out and it's really an experience in and of itself if you're a first-timer. Check out Magic Noodle!"}
{"text":"My second time here, they have MANY different options of noodles and soups so that's cool :)   First time I went two months ago I order the triple B and the magic beef. They came in literally like 3 minutes, so quick!!! One of them the noodles were undercooked so you could taste the dough in the soup, hard to finish the soup when it tastes like dough! The other soup where the noodles were cooked properly tasted good. Honestly I would have preferred if my noodles came later so that they would've been cooked better :p  Second time I went they were slower delivering the dishes but I had one squid skewer and that came instantly. I ordered the Gi JU X hand shaven noodles. I wanted to try hand shaven noodles but I realized I have a preference to the hand pulled instead. The shaven noodles kept slipping out of my chopsticks and I had to rely on the spoon, too much effort! They tasted fine just slower to consume :)   Prices are reasonable and lots of servers for prompt service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the place to go for a bowl of delicious noodles. From its taste to its texture the noodle is flawless. What I didn't like about the bowl was the meet inside; I remember getting their house special, and the pork chop inside is very salty and tasted like old meat... I thought it was a very bad combination with the noodles."}
{"text":"It was a great experience to see them making noodles by hand. The soup was way too salty, while there was no flavour in the noodles. I mean, there usually is no flavour in noodles, but don't you at least have to put some salts in it?"}
{"text":"The noodle was decent.  The lamb kebabs were average.  The whole experience was underwhelming. Half way through the meal I got bored. They give you tons of carbs and barely any meat. It's cheap but not really my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. They give you an electronic device while waiting.. One of those that beep when your table is ready. I rarely see this at Asian restaurants.   Their service was typical Chinese restaurant service.. Not really attentive and you have to wave them down.  As for the food... Well I prefer the one in Scarborough. Their portions felt smaller. The noodles.. I could taste the floury dough.. It did not taste like the dough was thoroughly mixed. Maybe I will go back next time and see if that was just a bad batch or their chef just makes it like that.  One thing I liked was their lamb skewers. Meat was plenty and flavourful!  When we got our bill they tried to bring us another bowl of noodles and charged us for it too..the waitress was confused. When we asked whether or not a bowl of noodles was ready (since everybody's arrived except one) they assumed we wanted another one and went ahead to place the order. When we politely told them we did not order it and would like it removed form the bill.. They asked if we could just pay for it and eat it as take out..."}
{"text":"Coming here during a weekend lunch hour required a 10 minute wait. They hand you a tag and when it beeps you can get seated.  The seating looks similar to the location in downtown. However, the menus are different. There are no cute names for each noodle, such as G.I. Ju for the pork intestine noodles. I assume it's due to the fact that they try to liven it up downtown where all the students are.   The regular ramen noodles here seemed to be machine made...given the uniform shape. When i ordered the same noodles downtown, they didn't look like this. Again, the noodles were over cooked. The knife cut noodles were better, but a bit thinner and smaller than the ones from the location downtown. The pork intestine noodle also looked different from the menu. I do have to say that there were a lot of noodles in the small size that I ordered.  The traditional LanZhou beef noodles only had 4 thin slices of beef, the soup base was very ordinary. As for the beef noodle soup, the noodles were again slightly over cooked, but the beef had tendons attached and very well braised.  The Shanxi style cold noodle appetizer was not worth ordering. The noodles were very oily with a strong peanut flavour to it. It also didn't look like what was pictured in the menu. The noodles were alright, they were like rice noodles.  I personally like the downtown location better for the noodle quality. However, if you are around Markham/Richmond Hill and want some Chinese noodles, this location is okay."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 8 PM and the seats were filled here and there. We were seated soon after and were given the menu and lemon water. I liked how they give lemon water, but it may not be the best if you're eating spicy food...  The seating was comfortable and the design of the restaurant was nice. There is a variety of seating: single seats facing the street, tables with chairs, and the comfy couch benches. At the back of the restaurant, you can see the noodles being made in-store!  The menu has a lot of photos and cute names! We ordered the Triple B (beef brisket) noodle and the G.I. Ju (pig intestine dao xiao mian - blade cut noodles). As well, we ordered a Juli Jelly, which consisted of mung bean noodles, cucumbers, carrots, chili sauce, and some vinegar. I mixed everything together, but it came out to be way too spicy...I had to get a bowl of water to dilute the spicyness. One thing about the jelly is that it is already pre-made, so the waitress just took it out of the fridge for us. I would have preferred if it was made to order.   As for the Triple B beef brisket noodle, I got to pick from the different kinds of noodles on the menu, so I picked the classic noodle since it is the only round-kind. The other noodles are flat, which I don't enjoy as much. The food came quicker than I expected. Upon first glance, the beef noodle looked like any ordinary bowl of noodle, but after tasting it and seeing the beef and white radish inside, I was pleased. However, the noodles were a bit too soft and the soup base could have been better. The brisket was very tender and there was a lot of tendon attached to the meat which I really liked! Also, the soup is not spicy, so it would be perfect if that's what you're looking for.  I have to say, the pig intestine noodle was very well made. The dao xiao mian was delicious! They were chewy and on point. There were some shanghai bok choy, pig intestines, scallions, and a VERY SPICY soup base! I had to rest after each time of eating the noodles because it was too much for me to handle. If this wasn't this spicy, I would have to say this noodle is my favourite. The soup base was good, but it was slightly too spicy for my liking!  Another bonus is that this location is very close to UofT campus, so it is a very good spot for students and late night eats! The staff were all young and friendly, and pretty quick with bringing the food/extra bowls we asked for to us!"}
{"text":"Hand-pulled noodles made from scratch? Check! Assortment of snacks like chinese cold appetizers and spicy lamb skewers? Double check! After Ling Long Legend closed down at FMP I was really concerned that I would no longer have a go to hand pulled noodle place to satiate my cravings. Then I discovered Magic Noodle who makes equally good chinese hand pulled noodles and along with an extensive menu of northern chinese snacks and apps!   On my visit I tried a few of their skewers and the noodles and was very pleased with the flavours in the dishes. The noodles had the perfect bite (in my opinion) and the skewers were hot and juicy without being overly seasoned. Super happy to have this as a go to northern chinese lunch place that offers affordable pricing and reasonable portions!  Be warned for lunch time though since they tend to get really busy. I would recommend visiting during non-busy hrs so you don't have to risk waiting outside for a table!"}
{"text":"Had noodles, lamb skewers and tofu skewers here.  Amazing.  There's always a line but the wait time isn't too bad. Skewers are on the pricier side. Wish there are similar restaurants like this one in downtown.."}
{"text":"Their hand-pulled noodles are super long but yummy and chewy. Magic noodle signature noodle soup was pretty good and same with Shanxi style beef burger.  Be aware if you are planning to have dinner here, they can get pretty busy with long line up."}
{"text":"Good place to eat a bowl of hot noodle! Reasonably priced, this place is a short walk from UT -I was studying at Robarts library. The noodles had a good chewy texture, and the broth was delicious too. We had the beer brisket noodle and the lamb noodle. They were both great."}
{"text":"What do you do when a storm hits Toronto in the middle of April? Eat noodles of course!   I came to Magic Noodle today hoping to get some warm noodle soup but ended up straying off the menu to their cold noodles instead lol. As a (sometimes) vegetarian, I've had their Tree Hugger noodle soup in the past which is a fairly large portion with abundant veggies. I can't say I loved the broth too much (too plain) but it's better if you add in their homemade chili oil! Today I had cold ramen noodles with their spicy peanut sauce (I think they call it schezuan?) and tofu. This dish normally comes with chicken, but I had it made with tofu instead. The sauce was pretty good, but again even better with the chili oil added. My only complaint is that the noodles were kind of clumpy, and I actually think this dish would've tasted better a little warm rather than cold. I mistakenly thought their cold noodles would be room temperature.   Overall, fairly decent food and portion sizes for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Magic noodle quickly became my place to go for lunch. It's fast and they serve consistently good quality noodle soup. I only been there for lunch but I they are open for 24 hours a day. I usually get a lamb skewer on the side and it's been amazing every time. Quick and fast and no need to tip."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and ordered items off their advertised sign. Food was okay...tolerable. The hot soy milk we ordered was microwaved and lukewarm when served. Service was terrible. The attendant was not helpful with short and curt answers when asked about menu items. She made us feel like we were bothering her for being there as customers."}
{"text":"Good food- definitely a yes.  I ordered tofu&squid skewer both were seasoned the same.. And squid was so small for $2.50 . rip off   Salty~ high sodium = high blood pressure  yes!!  Service : so-so ( seeing how they were hellabusy, noone really noticed us ..) Also don't like how they judge your looks and assume you speak the same language as them... Constantly kept speaking to us in mandarin even though we told them we don't understand!! [This is why I am giving them  -1star]   Other than that i will probably be back to try more noodles and different sides ~"}
{"text":"Why can't this stuff exist downtown Toronto?  I had the hand pulled noodles with duck- but it looks like the beef was the way to go as the broth is way tastier.  Skip the sweet potato cakes- they are just fried sliced of sweet potato."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night for the first time. There were some positives but unfortunately the negatives overpowered the good for me. First off, the hand pulled noodles were great. The dish (chicken friar) left something to be desired as it was lacking some flavour. However, the portion size was good and the price was decent.  Where I really have an issue is with the service. Our server was slow, dry, and not helpful at ALL. The food came quickly, but the server really left a bad impression on me- so bad that I don't think I'll be returning. He did not smile once, did not greet us, and just made me feel as if he wanted everyone out. Possibly the rudest service I have ever encountered.  The restaurant also had no cold water in sight- only room temperature. They also cheap out on their napkins (ripping them in half so that everyone only gets half a napkin).  They also don't take credit which is somewhat annoying. It's worth a try, but this place definitely has some improving to do before I return."}
{"text":"Open 24hrs, been here a few times and found some inconsistencies to their food. Noodles are made in house and there's often a chef making noodles.  Was there the other night with some coworkers and the noodles were a bit overcooked, the broth warm, and it felt like the energy and hype is gone from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. Good place to go if you're just looking for a quick meal around the U of T campus on a cold, winter day. The portions aren't too big but at least you can get extra soup for free!   Watching the chef in the back making the noodles is actually pretty cool :)"}
{"text":"Great noodle place. So happy to find a 24 hr place that serves deliciousness. Absolutely love their tofu and beef brisket soup."}
{"text":"When in doubt, and nothing is open, then head to the Magic Noodle. They're open 24/7 (that's a lot of noodle slamming) and all of their noodles are freshly handmade (you will definitely hear and see the guy making them when you go).   Unless you like plain soup, don't get their signature magic noodle dish (should be first menu item). Instead get the beef one (forgot which one) with the darker soup base. Much more flavour that compliments the handmade noodles.   Also, you must order the lamb skewers. Must.   The place is small so unless you go as a pair and share tables with strangers, be prepared to wait in long lineups during peak hours (after bar hours and dinner time)."}
{"text":"Jennifer K beat me to the punch-line - this place is clearly magic. It's small and homey but definitely a delicious place. My four-person meal came out to $33 overall (tax + tip), which is a pretty good deal for their delicious food.   We ordered the beef brisket soup noodles, the ja jiang noodles, and the lamb soup noodles. The lamb was by far the best - the broth was flavourful and there was a good amount of meat provided. We also ordered the pan-fried beef bun, which was okay but it's not high on my list. Their red bean cake was amazing though, and I'd say you need to get that if you come here. A good amount of red bean and totally worth its price.   Overall the place is really fun (I always enjoy watching the chefs at work creating noodles) so it's yummy and entertaining at the same time. If you're in the area, it's worth a stop by.   Bonus - their bathroom is single room style, but clean. So yay!"}
{"text":"Another to go place for noodle! This is way different than Japanese ramen, so don't expect to be the same thing! I prefer their hand made pull noodle than their signature Dao Xiao mian. If you like to eat lamb, then you must try their lamb soup noodle. It is full of favour. Overall, great restaurant for a fast and convenient meal"}
{"text":"Magic Noodle has always been a good go-to noodle place for late night noms. I've always enjoyed the hand pulled noodles here but the Pork Scroll definitely stole the show. I wasn't expecting it to be as tasty as it was -- it had a very Peking duck-esque texture and flavour!! Super delicious and definitely a recommended must-try when you come.   The ladies here were also very polite and gave us excellent service. We told them before ordering that we would be doing separate bills and it was not a problem at all. The food came out quickly and we didn't have to wait very long -- granted it was not busy at 11:30 at night on a Friday. ;)   Overall, it's a great place to chill and have a casual meal! I'll definitely be returning for the Pork Scrolls!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Did not think it would be this busy at 3 in the morning. Was kinda hungry super early morning the other day, but didn't know where to go. Eventually made our way here as they are open 24/7, but was definitely surprised with the amount of people around.   Always nice to get some nice noodles at any time of the day, but this definitely hit the spot. Had been to the Richmond Hill location before, so knew what to order.  Service was a bit slow, and they were quite busy. They definitely did NOT want to be there, so wasn't the most pleasant service received. Did get everything we needed, and everything worked out though.   Nice to know that this location is open all the time, so when in doubt, you can always head here for a late night meal!"}
{"text":"Yay! Finally got to try out Magic Noodle, and I have to say it was pretty good! I had heard that waiting for a table could be killer, but was lucky to get one right away.   Parking is a bit of a hassle in this plaza, as there are very limited spaces, but coming at a later time seemed to help. Upon entering, the 2 of us were asked to sit at the high top area, but there was an available table in plain sight. Not the best impression, in my opinion.   After sitting down, nobody came to check on us for over 5 minutes. Had to eventually call over a server to put in our order. Ended up getting the Hand Pulled Noodles with Braised Beef and the Flavoured Pork Wrap.  The noodles in a rich broth and the noodles at perfect tenderness. Definitely a difference with hand pulled noodles! The pork wrap was also very good, with crispy pork on the inside, coming together deliciously with sauce.   Service overall was on the poor side, with them not wanted to seat us at a free table, and only ever coming to our table to give us our food. Overall decor was nice, and definitely enjoyed the open kitchen concept. Just make sure you bring some cash! They don't take credit cards, which is a hassle for those, like me, who only ever carry plastic!  Guess it's one of the restaurants you come to enjoy the food only, and the service is virtually nonexistent."}
{"text":"You come here when you want to get a late night stack because they are open 24hrs.  You end up waiting for a table at 2am because it's packed at 2am.  They do, however, have those vibrating wireless devices that notifies you when there is a table available. Quite high tech for some Chinese noodle place, much better than waiting for your name to be called.  Anyways, noodle is good, decent snack options.  Probably not the cleanest place but whatever, it's Chinese a Chinese noodle joint.   Oh, the water has lemon in it, fancy."}
{"text":"It's great to see Magic Noodle opening downtown.  Who doesn't like hand pulled/shaved soup noodles?  We had the triple b and magic beef, as well as seaweed salad on the side.  The magic beef was tasty, but the triple b was the star.  The broth was a little more flavourful with a tinge of spice and the braised beef they give you was generous and tender.  The seaweed salad was delicious and spicy - note this is NOT the seaweed salad you get a run of the mill sushi resto.  The service was fast and extremely friendly.  This is a great alternative on a cold night if you are not feeling ramen or pho.  Also - I got a free air freshener for my car!    Frankly, I am a bit surprised it has so many 1 star ratings. It's a bit comical reading some of them though.  I've eaten countless bowls of soup noodles and Magic noodle is excellent."}
{"text":"Really happy magic noodle is now in north York! Loved their lamb skewers and tofu skewers. Staffs are super friendly too."}
{"text":"I really love their noodles. Love Beef noodle soup and chicken fried noodle. I usually take out dinner cos they are really busy in rush hours."}
{"text":"Questionable cleanliness every time i go here. Try not to eat food off the table. The prices are pretty reasonable and lots of menu items. I like the pork belly noodle soup. Its salty and terrible for your health. I've tried most of the noodles now on the menu. Slightly above average in taste but the noodles are always great. This is a great lunch place. Like all asian places bring cash."}
{"text":"Was just here. I ordered the hand cut noodle with pork belly, 2 sides and boiled egg. Noodles were tasty up to the point that I had asked for more soup - assuming they would just charge me for the extra soup. Waitress was nice to ask me which base (beer, pork, chicken). I said any is fine. It came back filled to the top with hot water! Could have suggested for me not to add it or just fill it with the damn broth!  Noodle soup ended up tasteless. I'm a cook/chef myself so I do know the difference. Horrible practice."}
{"text":"The worst take out food I have ever had. Period. We ordered two orders of popcorn chicken, and guess what comes.. A small box with a little bit of chicken, that they wrote 2x on. Something about the chicken also tasted like bleach too. Definitely do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Came here late one night after consuming some adult beverages.  The beauty of this place is that it's 24 hours!  If you are looking for fresh handmade noodles in a rich broth, this is the place to be.  Had their noodle soup with lamb and it was great.  The soup was a tad salty, but the texture of the noodles was perfect.  We came here at about 2am on a Saturday night and they were packed, but service was still on point, quick and accurate!  To end, great food, great service."}
{"text":"Its a cute small little noodle joint! I've always wanted to come here and it's good to say I wasn't disappointed ! I got The Magic which contains sliced beef, pork chop, fried egg, braised lamb, beef tripe, pickled turnip. There is Chili sauce & vinegar on table for your preference of taste as the soup base is plain.    there are other noodle sizes so I changed mine to the ribbon! I didn't really enjoy this change bc it made it more difficult to eat plus when the noodle slips through my chop sticks it splashes soup on me.  This place is unique because they make and hand pull the noodles. The texture of the noodle I got was slightly chewy.  the staff were very quick and on top of their stuff, the food came very fast as well.   Next time I would like to try some different side dishes!"}
{"text":"It is the Chinese-featured noodles. Really made me think of Lanzhou, which is the origin of this, also a cozy environment for launch or dinner"}
{"text":"Definitely had high hopes when I read all the comments and pictures, however the food wasn't as good as expected. We ordered the signature noodles and signature beef sandwich/pancake. Not sure what the name was but I can tell you noodles are fresh but the broth was meh. The food filled me up but not satisfied at all. I suggest u guys try something else."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner.  I really liked the hand pulled noodles, but not the chopped up ones. I found the soup noodles were pretty good, as were the dumplings, but nothing really blew me away. The barbecued items were good, though.  The place was busy and there were only two servers on staff, so you had to flag them down whenever you needed something."}
{"text":"This place seems to always be busy. I passed by one time at 1 AM and it was still busy. I guess it being a 24-hour restaurant really helps if you're looking for noodle soup at midnight.  Compared to some other noodle places near Yonge and Finch, this place is somewhat bigger (I'm talking on the scale of  25 seats vs 10), but it can fill up fast. The layout is pretty tight, with a small path from the entrance leading up to the counter, and another path circling around the right. And then they just fit in as many tables and chairs as reasonably possible.  The washrooms do not provide paper towels, but in exchange they offer an over-powered hand-dryer that will blow you away if you're not careful. Rarely see that in a restaurant.  They specialize in hand-pulled and sliced noodle bowls, with the option of noodle soup or fried noodles. You can choose to build your own bowl, or pick one of their signatures. A number of snacks and appetizers are also available, and they have cups of (what I assume is) fresh soy milk available for purchase. The cups also come with Magic Noodle logo for the collectors.  Ordering is done up at the counter. Pay first, grab a number if you're dining in, and take a seat. They offer take-out and dine-in options so if you're planning to dine-in, you should grab a seat first before ordering otherwise someone else might do it and you lose.  Food was served in 3-5 minutes. I ordered the Magic Lamb for $8.49. It comes with goji, dates, and various herbs, so it has a nice herbal soup flavour. Lamb is good, but doesn't come with too many pieces. You get a lot of noodles, and I liked the texture; should let the noodles sit a few minutes to let it soak in the broth.  One thing I noticed was that the broth was a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"I get their soups often off of Uber eats. They're SO good. I haven't found a soup that I didn't like yet. Everything is super flavourful and makes you want more.   Their noodles are really easy on the mouth and easy to slurp on. Their soup bases are so delicious. My favourite so far has been their magic beef noodles.   Their menu is diverse and customizable. If you don't want meat options they'll gladly take it out for you.   If you order through Uber eats they open up in the morning hours, and deliver very quickly. Perfect if you wanted to pack something for work."}
{"text":"Chewy noodles in hot, savoury broth. You can also get little side dishes and meat skewers. The proportions are huge and usually the noodles come with some meat and depending on what you choose, an egg. Really filling and warms you up! Open 24 hrs so you could go at 2 am when you're craving ramen!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to cheap noodle places in Richmond Hill and I always order the most popular beef noodle soup with a lot of hot sauce on the side of course. Don't expect anything fancy in here, it's just a standard restaurant with some tables and chairs. You can see the chefs in the back making the different types of noodles though. It's very reasonably priced and any bowl of noodle soup will only be about $10. The portions are pretty big so you won't leave feeling hungry. I haven't been there in a while though, but I've heard that the quality has been deteriorating. Still, if you need a quick cheap bite to eat, I'd still recommend this place for that. Just keep your expectations reasonable."}
{"text":"The noodles were super delish. I love the fact their cold dishes were not too spicy.  Their beef broth was so flavorful.  The hot sauce on the steamed chicken was really yum."}
{"text":"I came to the realization that if you're in this area looking for a late night meal, then this place is probably your best bet. The service is quick and the food is good - for eating at a restaurant at this time in the night, you get a bang for your buck.   My only warning would be that my lamb skewers were overly seasoned with MSG/salt (although it was more meaty this time since my last review). I mean, it's the perfect type of food for a hangover.. but not so much when you're sober.  I also found that the lamb noodle soup was lacking in actual pieces of lamb meat but the broth was very flavorful. Oh well, I guess that's what happens when lamb is expensive and the selling price is kept reasonable. Overall though, the soup noodles are fairly tasty (especially when you're craving something hot and filling past 11pm)."}
{"text":"Decent meal affordable price A lot of people this only means it is indeed popular and has clientele Chilli oil was superb too"}
{"text":"As a loyal customer to the Richmond Hill location, this downtown one disappointed me twice.   The service was horrible the first time I visited, but the food was alright and made me happy.   The second time I went with my boyfriend, my soup was service barely lukewarm. My boyfriend did not get served his soup until 30 mins after mine, even though we ordered the same thing. Even then, his soup was just warm at most. It was -20 degrees outside and I was thoroughly disappointed.   I don't think I'll be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our go to place for beef noodles. It's 24/7 and the wait time is short - I received my food within 5 minutes, which is pretty rarely in Chinese restaurants. The soup base is just perfect and their spicy oil is my fav!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken friar and got a bottle of water... I'm celiac so i ordered the rice noodle dish specifically. I sit down and open my water bottle and take a sip and relax waiting for my food...ten minutes later the waitress comes and says she made a mistake and they are sold out of rice noodles so i say unfortunately there is nothing i can eat. I ask for a refund and they agree they refuse to refund my water... i ordered the water in conjunction with my meal which i originally paid for and they said was available... i don't need a bottle of water without food... it's just bad customer service...   TH was my third time here he other two times they got my order wrong..."}
{"text":"We ordered hand-pulled noodles - one with lamb and the other with beef. The broth was flavour-less and we only got two pieces of meat each. My lamb was technically just large pieces of bone with little to no meat on them. To add to this, their service was also very poor. I really wanted to love this place because I LOVE noodles. I order noodles everywhere I go, so I'd like to consider myself a trusted source when it comes to judging noodles. If I ever plan on returning to this place (probably never, unless a friend forces me) and have a more positive experience, I will consider editing this review."}
{"text":"This place never closes and the service is quick and efficient! The hand made noodles are not easy to make but its super cool when you see the chefs pound the dough on the table with authority! I would love to learn how make these noodles and in the process gain some 20 inch Guns as well!  I came here and ordered the triple beef noodle soup with the thick hand made noodles and it came out in a flash! The broth was super hot and delicious and I totally burned my mouth when consuming it!   We also ordered some bao buns for appetizers and they were of a \"meh\" quality.  Note to self...order noodles at a noodle bar, not baos.   Check."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Magic Noodle by the boyfriend who asked if I'd be interested because he knows I'm all about those carbs and I love noodles.  We went here for a late lunch and there was a line up outside the door and it was packed!  We waited less than 5 minutes and was seated right away, thank goodness cause I was starved.  The inside of the restaurant was obviously very congested with customers but in the back was an open-concept kitchen where you could see the chefs hand-pulling the fresh noodles.  I was so excited to try it and I ended up getting their Hand-Pulled Noodle with Braised Beef Brisket.  I was not disappointed at all. The broth was delicious, the beef brisket was tender, and the noodles were cooked to perfection.  I highly recommend this specific dish to anyone who likes beef brisket.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was their room temperature lemon water that they serve.  Yuck!  The service was mediocre for a very busy restaurant and they obviously want you in and out as quick as possible, so if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, come visit Magic Noodle.. They're Magically Delicious!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend tried this restaurant and asked if I'd be interested in trying it.  Thank goodness I did.  I'm a big noodle fanatic and I wasn't about to pass up this opportunity especially because he told me that they hand make and hand pull the noodles.  We went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and it was jam-packed, luckily for us we got a seat right away.  I ended up ordering the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Braised Beef Brisket.  The noodles were cooked to perfection and the broth was so delicious with just the right amount of spice that kept me wanting more.  The only downside to it was that the portion size was a bit smaller than I had expected.  I ordered a small and was still hungry after, which was unfortunate.  In terms of the customer service, given that they were really busy, was very quick.  But again, being an Asian restaurant they're all about getting their guests in and out quickly and effectively.  None the less, I am definitely coming back here and I highly recommend all those noodle fanatics out there to try it because it is magical!"}
{"text":"Had The Magic noodle bowl for lunch (small size) and it left me very full. Our waitress was friendly. We asked about the difference in sizes - small vs large - and she said there is not much of a difference. She said the large has a few more pieces of meat and some more noodles. I went with the small and it was plenty. I have to say the presentation was lacking (the meat was tucked away under the noodles so it didn't look like much in the bowl when it arrived) BUT the taste was definitely there. The broth was tasty and not too salty. The noodles were chewy (I got the pulled noodles but I also tried the shaved noodles and that was very good too). The pork chop was tender and flavourful. The beef slices and lamb were both yummy. The lamb had great lamb flavour. The egg was ok. The bowl had one piece of lamb and 2-3 beef slices. Their chilli oil is also very good! And they sell them in bottles. We ended up buying a few bottles to go. As for price point, it seems to me on the high end for a bowl of noodles (about $9 for small Magic). All in all though, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This place has gone down in quality! Stop adding so much salt!!!! The soup base is so salty now that I need to get a drink at McDonald's next door. Quality has really gone down. People are not focus and experience not too good customer service and can't be imptoved"}
{"text":"This time around, this place really wasn't very good. I don't know if it is the lunchtime crowd, or if it was something else, but I was really not impressed by this place today.   The pro is that seating was abundant....maybe that wasn't a pro after all.  I ordered the special noodles. IT LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. There were like 2 pieces of meat, two pieces of pickled radish, and noodles. No spices, and nothing else. They skimped on everything.   Then there was the cold potato dish. The dish was half empty. What a crappy experience. I really wont' be going back unless someone else insists....  Pro  No wait times this time,   Con  Half empty appetizer No meat or veg in the noodles Left feeling hungry"}
{"text":"Food was fairly decent, especially at it's price point compared to what you'd get anywhere downtown.  However the service is errrr militaristic.  We were in a bit of a rush, needed to basically dine and dash (while paying of course).  This place gets stupid busy at around 6.  We came in at 5, with no one really coming by other than dropping off a canteen of water and menus.   We spent a bit about 5 minutes going over the menu, and by the time we were ready to order, then entire staff went on break and started having dinner.  The kitchen staff was on one side, and servers on the other.  The whole place just came to a halt.  When we tried to explain to someone we were in a bit of a rush, her eyes glazed over and responded to us in Mandarin.  Uhh, none of us speaks Mandarin.  She went back and sat down to her dinner.  5:20 rolls around.  And finally forced someone to take our order.  Luckily the food came quick. And we were out of there by 5:50 (we needed to be out of there by 5:45).  We woofed down our food like probably the two guys who escaped the NY prison would if they had the chance.  So... meh."}
{"text":"No good... super salty broth and so so knife cut noodles.  It's open 24/7. This should have been a sign...  I got the beef brisket with knife cut noodles. I don't know what else to say but that the soup broth was really bad. It was super salty and not tasty. It left a bad taste in the mouth. I think the noodles would have been okay if the broth was at least decent. The beef brisket was not bad but quite fatty. And, they don't give you many vegetables.  I also found the inside a little off putting. It was really cold and their dirty dish cart was not put somewhere out of the way.  One plus is that the portion is quite big and will probably fill you up. The knife cut noodles expand with liquid too, which I think makes you feel even fuller.  For a filling, cheap eat late night, it would be satisfactory. Otherwise, I would stay away! Personally I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever got. As soon as I order the food, the service asks me to pay the fee+tips NOW.  The noodle is so so(big size is smaller than normal). Plus They offer me a sports bottle (fill the water by yourself man).... DIRTY ENVIRONMENT (seriously)."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy they opened up in my area. I used to make it a mission to go to the Markham location when I'm in the area. Now I can get it with a short subway ride.   Same great taste as other location. Fresh hand made noodles are awesome. The flavors are pretty good. It doesn't taste like a load of MSG, though I wouldn't be surprised if they use a little MSG. Overall, I like this kind of Chinese noodle over Japanese ramen which I find far too salty.  I'll definitely come back once in a while."}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for a table and it's worth it. There are lots of reasons why this place gets so many customers.   I really like how this place specializes in noodles. The standard Chinese restaurant offers a million items on their menu. The result is that when you go to the average Chinese restaurant, some dishes will be good, some will be bad, depending on the cook working that day. This place does noodles (and some appetizers) and they do it really well. They have different broths and you can order different size of noodles (e.g. thick vs thin).   I had the beef noodle and my partner had the lamb noodle. The beef soup is very similar to Pho. The lamb was good too.   Price wise, this place is very reasonable. It's not \"cheap\" but it's not expensive either. If you just want to stuff yourself, Pho is better value. But for authentic Chinese style noodles, you must come here. I'd be coming every week if I didn't live so far."}
{"text":"As a fresh hand-pulled noodle restaurant, during normal business hours, they are definitely worthy of a 4 star for rating for delivering hot and consistent bowls of noodles. But the fact that they are 24hrs makes it an easy 5 star rating.  The broth is rich and meaty. The noodles are chewy and soak up the broth well. Be sure to mix your protein choice in well as the meats are sometimes cold when thrown in the bowl."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend. I'm so glad I came here to try! They have lot of unique flavors. The space is very cozy and staff are nice. I love the selection they have between thin or thick noodles. They also have a noodle chef that's on site making live noodles in front of you! It's like a free show.   I would also recommend getting their snacks. They start at $2.50 and I LOVE the spciy tofu!"}
{"text":"While everyone is all up in the ramen craze - I don't see what the hype is all about.  I've tried it and it really isn't $11.50 more tastier than your usual instant noodles at the groceries store.  So this weekend,  I traded in the ramen for some lamian.  Magic Noodle (not to be confused with the low-carb Miracle Noodle) is located in a plaza in Scarborough and specializes in lamian (??), originating from the Northwest province of Lanzhou, China.  Lamian, which means \"stretching noodles\" is made from the stretching and folding of dough into strands; the thickness of the noodles is dependent on the number of times the dough is stretched.  The place was packed full of people, both seated and waiting but we were seated in 15 minutes which isn't too bad.  The eatery also features \"sliced noodles\" similar to a Pappardelle in thickness (though shorter in length) which hails from the province of Shanxi, China.  If noodles aren't your thing, I highly recommend the steamed buns.  Hand Pulled Noodle with Beef ($6.99, small): Unlike ordering a small bowl of pho at a Vietnamese restaurant, this one was not all-soup-no-noodles.  The broth was extremely flavorful and the noodles were cooked to a perfect al dente and was served with thinly sliced beef tendon.  While there were condiments at the table (your usual soy sauce, chili oil and vinegar) - it didn't need it.  Sliced Noodle with Traditional Braised Pork ($6.99, small): While the hand pulled noodles were delicious, in terms of flavor it didn't hold a flame to the braising liquids used in this dish.  Flavors of anise interlaced with soy sauce and a tad bit of sweetness coupled with pork belly makes it a hard dish to top.  The texture of these noodles were slightly different, closely resembling that of the Shanghainese nian gao (??, savory glutinous rice cakes).  For those who don't feel like slurping on noodles there are also a variety of skewered meats, steamed buns and pancake rolls to choose from.  Leek + Pork Steamed Bun: It is pretty hard to find a good steamed bun that has a good filling to bun ratio in addition to being supple - this one is pretty darn close!  The filling is hearty and the braising liquid soaks the bun just enough without making it soggy.  The housemade bun has just the right amount of \"elasticity\" to it while still being supple.  Beef Pancake Roll: Carnivores will rejoice as this pancake roll is 100% beef - no scallion fillers here!  However, I found the pancake to be a tad too thick (but perfectly crispy).  The beef filling was tender and saucy.  A plate of freshly made pasta rings in at $18+ in the city - this is by comparison a steal!  It doesn't get any fresher than watching the chef stretch the noodles in anticipation of a bowl arriving shortly at your own table.  The damage at the end of the day was a thrifty $24 for 4 dishes and it was more than enough food for 2 people.  There's nothing more comforting than a bowl of warm noodles and when it's this fresh; it's even better!  The service, like most casual Chinese eateries is virtually non-existent, but then again they don't expect a 15% tip.  Also note that it's cash-only.  The kitchen is well-staffed (5-6 people) and service comes at the wave of a hand.  This is definitely my go-to noodle place east of the city."}
{"text":"If you want some ok hand pulled noodle and want quick service this is the place to be. They have quite a list of different types of hand pulled noodle and soup base. We ordered the beef tendon with spicy beef soup and got the thicker noodles. This was tasty but quite salty after finishing. A large can definitely feed two people if you're planning on ordering side dishes.  We also ordered their cold spicy chicken (not sure why).. but definitely will not be ordering again. It is essentially a steamed chicken leg with some sa cha sauce and hot sauce on top. We also got a lamb skewer and beef tendon skewer. Very cumin tasting... super strong. So if you do not like cumin I would avoid or ask for NO seasoning.   We also got the squid skewer and it was decent at a ok price (if i remember correctly it is 2.95 per skewer).   This restaurant could get quite busy on weekend and late night eats but the turnaround for tables is quite fast. Not sure if they take credit card here but similar to any asian restaurant, always bring cash."}
{"text":"Craving for some noodles and decided to try this place out. Was very impressed. Place is clean, servers are nice and noodles are plenty. Reasonably priced and they give lemon water to drink! They got noodles and some snacks too. Accept cash and debit( only if spend over $20 before tax)"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance.. TO BE SEATED! It so happens that everytime I visit (both locations) that they're full. Line goes out the door and the wait time is not very cool. I guess that's what happens when there's good food in town. Luckily, I was not disappointed - the noodle (hand pulled noodle + braised beef) was certainly one to remember. Although the soup did not give me a kick, the noodle was absolutely fantastic. Every bite was chewy and not overcooked - I hate soggy noodles! I also ordered the wonton soup on the side, which had about 7 wontons. That was also very tasty, though it was a bit salty. The wontons were cooked just enough so the skin didn't peel off. The meat in it was fresh, but could pack in a bit more because the 3/4 of it was the skin and 1/4 was meat.. So I ate more skin than meat! So sad.. Chinese restaurants always find little ways to cheap out lol!  On the flip side, this is why I took a star off - slow service and washroom. I can look past the slow service because the place was just that damn crowded! However, I still didn't like how the washrooms were. Literally 3 rooms (female, male, handicap) with ONE toilet, sink, soup dispenser and paper towel dispenser.. Unbelievable. I waited at least 10 minutes for the dude to finish before it was my turn. I always thought male washrooms were always free.. Until last night lol. Perhaps I should have used the ladies or handicap..  I'm not sure exactly how this place got a 1 star review, but it oust Zoup next door Lolol that certainly speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Seeing this pop up on my Yelp radar actually got me excited as I was scouting for a new noodle place. It also surprised me that it was in the Midland/McNicoll plaza as I've been there a couple of times, but haven't noticed Magic Noodle!  But... Perhaps my expectations were a little too great because I left with quite a disappointment.  Coming in a little before lunch time, it wasn't as packed. Our waitress was on her phone and yawning while she told us to sit wherever we liked. Alrrrrright... Maybe she was from the overnight/early morning shift since Magic Noodle is open 24/7 were my thoughts to let this one part of the service slide because I found it to be kind of unbelievable even at an Asian restaurant standard.  Menus were given and Magic Noodle offers quite a number of stuff! From appetizers, to fried noodles, cold dishes, skewers, but I think they specialized in noodle soups since they have more options of those.  We settled for The Magic and the Foochow Bowl both from the Hand-Pulled Noodle category. Upon taking our orders, she seemed to not really care, but when she was talking to her co-workers, she was very loud and making a ruckus with them, all while speaking Mandarin.  Each table has a water jug filled with water and a lemon slice in them. Along condiments like chopsticks, tissues, chili oil, soya sauce, etc.  The Magic noodle bowl consisted of beef stock, sliced beef, pork chop, fried egg, braised lamb, beef tripe, pickled turnip, cilantro and scallions with chili oil on the side, but my friend opted chili oil in general because of low spice tolerance (since we're not sure how much they were going to put in).  I got the Foochow bowl which had a mix of chicken and pork stock, fishballs, imitation crab, seaweed and scallions. The fishballs were stuffed with pork fillings which surprised me, in a good and bad way. Good because it was stuffed, bad because I actually prefer regular fishballs compared to the stuffed ones.  At first glance, they didn't give us much or at least comparing to the pictures on the menu. But to be fair, it was written at the bottom of the menu that \"pictures are for illustrative purposes only. actual products might differ\". Damm straight it differed from the pictures...  It was a disappointing experience for both me and my friend. My friend's meal actually had more bones than meat... and we had both expected more meat in general as well. My meal was just alright but nothing special nor would I get it again... just didn't feel that satisfying.  The only thing we both agreed on was that the noodles were really really good. I'm assuming they make the noodles by themselves in the store considering they labelled it \"hand-pulled noodles\", and it was just really soft and chewy. But that is about the only good thing I have to say about this restaurant.  The food didn't satisfy us, and needless to say that the service didn't improve at all. Won't be back and it's such a shame because they seemed to get decent reviews and it wouldhv been a new go-to spot to come for late night eats if I had a better experience."}
{"text":"My first time and loved it. Amazing choices for noodles either in a soup of as a regular dish. Great service hot fresh food and I love the background music"}
{"text":"Was left a bit dissapointed. I wanted so much to enjoy this place due to raving testimonial reviews heard from friends. However, I was not impressed by what was offered. Dinner for two we ordered, 1 sm intestine hand pulled noodle, 1 lg pork sliced noodle, a serving of beef and tripe in chili sauce and 1 lamb skewer. To start off, yes that was quite a lot of food and I was thankful my dinner partner put his foot down on limiting my order, as if left on my own device, I would've ordered without consideration. The cold side dish was the first to arrive at the table, the price was reasonable but the portion was a bit small (seemed like the theme of this restaurant on the protein portions). I loved the taste of the cold dish, the sauce was deliciously balanced between savoury, sweet and spicy...just wished we got a bit more. The two noodles followed soon after. Right off the bat, the lack of protein was noted. The amount of noodle ratio to meat was ridiculous. When you have a big bowl of noodle that lack veggie and meat then you are pretty much left with the noodle to bear the burden of being the star of the dish. Unfortunately, I did not feel that the noodle here can bear that burden. The noodle was nice in the first few bites and quickly became boring to eat. I actually felt full from sheer boredom...could not eat anymore, not because of fullness, but from the noodle just becoming tedious and lackluster. The pull noodle was what I took issue with most. It was heavy and became overly starchy as the broth cooled. The broth and intestines were flavourful but the bowl itself lacked dimension and that wow factor. One the other hand the sliced noodle faired a bit better in scale but presented with the same issues on a lesser scale. The soy based sauce failed to impress (unlike the sauce found in the cold dish). The lamb skewer was prepared well but the seasoning and spicy left an unpleasant after taste that had to be washed of in our broth. Overall, the noodle did not shine and the ratio was not impressive by any means. I don't think I would ever go out of my way to come here, but wouldn't too strongly oppose to coming back, if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"the food is great! i usually don't post reviews but the service here is horrible -- the female waitresses were very rude -- just made the experience here unenjoyable..."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go to if you are craving a fresh bowl of noodle soup. My bf and I came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch and the restaurant was half full so were seated immediately. We scoped out what everyone was eating and decided to opt for the beef noodle soup. I ordered it with the thin noodles and my bf got the thicker flat noodles (which tasted better). Broth was flavourful but a little slightly over oily. Think I will try the lighter broth next time. The portions were big but the meat given was a little on the stingier side. We also had a side order of their beef and pork pancake. Nothing special (not enough meat) and probably wouldn't get it next time.  Typical of an asian restaurant, the service was quick and efficient. It was also pretty cool with their open concept kitchen to see the chefs making the handmade noodles.  Overall, a great place for late night eats since they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Long wait times and the taste is quite average for handmade chinese noodles. Beef brisket noodles were lackluster and featured some chewy brisket. Other than that the food was quite authentic. Service is definitely lacking when they ask you to order before you've been seated. I would say it looks relatively clean for a 24 hour restaurant but only time will tell."}
{"text":"I came here for the hand pulled noodles and they were okay - I got the braised pork with hand shaved noodles and while the noodles had a good texture, the broth and pork were too salty and it felt off with the noodles. I also tried the scallion pancakes and they were delicious. The noodles I had were 7/10 for me so I'm willing to come back and give them another try."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. It is the second time I've eaten here and was much busier before. I got here at 1.30pm and it was about half full. Last time I came, we were waiting outside for a table. I ordered the pork bone noodle and the bones were still cold in the centre. My friend got the beef brisket soup noodle. Overall, not bad for a bowl of soup noodles for $6.99 (s). We also ordered a bbq tofu stick and a bbq lamb skewer. They were both flavourful and not charred. Worst thing was the small flies that were flying all around the restaurant because of the water bamboo plants. You shouldn't have those in restaurants because you do get the tiny flies from them.  Overall, it's not a bad place to go for a bowl of noodles and some bbq skewers."}
{"text":"3.5 rating.  Finally opened a location downtown, very close to UofT - great for students. I wanted to try a few things and so we ordered the pig's ear with soy sauce, the pork jiamo as apps. I ordered a bowl of triple B which is consisted of hand pulled noodles and beef brisket in beef broth.   I found the pigs ear not that special and for 4.99 I'm like..ehh so I'll pass on that next time. The pork jiamo is quite nice the bun is crispy but not a lot of pork as I like. Lastly, the noodles were thin and the beef brisket was a bit fatty. I liked the broth but found it somewhat salty, have a feeling they put msg in it!   I'd come back though because there are other things I wanna try such as the beef and tofu skewers."}
{"text":"Always full of people here. The food is just okay. This two star is for the poor service."}
{"text":"First time here. Personally I prefer ramen and vermicelli. But I was passing by and I was craving a bowl of hot soup so I decided to give them a try.  I ordered the \"tree hugger\" (minus the egg). It's noodles with green veggies and shiitake mushrooms. Noodles are prepared fresh from scratch. Veggies were fresh and tasty. Next time I'm trying their fried menu.  Place is clean and spacious. Good for group. They open late which is convenient. Free Wi-Fi courtesy of McDonald's.  PS. Real tree huggers don't eat eggs."}
{"text":"I tried the one in Scarborough and for some reason the flavor and portions are way better then the Richmond hill one. I went here last night for dinner and order the Original Magic noodle bowl. The meat was so lacking, and all they throw in is lots of noodles, lots of onions and celantro and literally 4 thin slices of meat. BLAAH! I also ordered the mixed veggie cold dish, and the cucumbers tasted like it was sitting there for awhile. I'm a bit disappointed. I been here twice and I doubt I'll have a third time here. Sorry."}
{"text":"My go to spot. Very traditional northern  noodles place. It's always packed with people. And for good reason. Very good food. try the egg plant noodle. You can ask for free soup on the side."}
{"text":"Fantastic noodles!! I recommended to my friends! Everyone loves it. And it's pretty popular now.  Top recommend:  1. Featured beef noodles and Pork Noodles! Noodles are very chewy and soup is very fresh and tasty. 2. lamb skewer and squid skewer. Yummy! perfectly marinated and grilled. Tender and tasty 3. All other noodles are good too but those two mentioned above are my favorite.  Not recommend: cold dish. I have tried a few and don't like them."}
{"text":"So ive been here a couple of times now and i must say that this place is overrated. The first time i tried this place it was above average (not bad). Each successive time ive gone, however, the foods been tasting more and more bland. In fact, the most recent time i went (got the braised beef noodle soup) my bowl of noodles was ridiculous. Unfortunately i forgot to take pics otherwise u guys would see what i was talking about. I got 2 pieces of beef and lots of noodle in my bowl. The only thing that seemed to have a bit of seasoning was the beef. Everything else tasted bland as hell. my noodles tasted like the chef had forgotten to shake the water off before putting in the soup. Said soup felt like it had been diluted a lot. Maybe it was just a busier day than all the other times i went but then again, food quality should always stay consistent (bad service i can let slide more often). all in all this place is decent for grabbing a quick bite but ive prolly drawn the line to stop returning as my taste buds seem to require richer flavours. You can definitely taste the freshness of the noodles though (proper springiness and bite), so at least that's a plus."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for comfort food that warms your stomach. I always get the magic beef with mid-flat noodles and add their homemade chilli oil to it. It hits the spot and satisfies my cravings. Their chilli oil is amazing and adds a kick to the noodles. They even sell jars of it at the front of their restaurant.   I always go around dinner time and it's never too busy. The noodles are pulled to order and the food arrives quickly. The portion sizes are pretty big and more than enough to fill me up, but you can also choose to add extra noodles for $1 and extra beef for $3."}
{"text":"We sat down at 6:45 PM and ordered by 6:47 PM with a waitress called Stephy. The food here is simple, all dishes take 2-5min to prepare as all the items are premade. By 7:10 PM we complained to another waiter that our food still hasn't come yet whilst multiple other customers who ordered or even sat down after us got their order. He comes back and tells us to try order again, WTF?????! He tells us it must be a system issue...Umm, NOPE. Stephy was nowhere to be found, meaning she left for the night and decided that an order she took from a customer was less important than her getting off work. She couldn't even input our order into the system before leaving. Then why the f*** did she take our order to begin with? This is outrageous and simply unacceptable customer service, and extremely irresponsible."}
{"text":"Had a number of items here.  Wanton noodle, triple beef noodle and a pork bun and beef Sesame crispy pancake.  It's was not to my liking. The wantons were not as good as those from the grocery store in terms of flavor of content.  There was not much beef in the beef noodle.  The noodles were freshly made and as expected don't have much chew.  So if you prefer them style noodle you may not like these.  I did like the pancake item... It's like a scallion pancake minus the scallions... And with lots of roses Sesame seeds and chopped beef."}
{"text":"Weird how most of the kitchen staff stared out into resturant floor (watching you eat.. lol) expressionless. While I was eating a sever wiped down a table next to me like a mad woman and flung a piece of chewed on bone at my leg, without apology. I'm a big fan of hand pulled noodle, but can't say I was impressed by the noodle or broth. Felt and tasted typical."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their noodles because they're fresh and chewy. I will definitely come back for more. Best noodle soup place I've ever been too!"}
{"text":"Love love love the noodle. I am totally obsessed with the pork and chicken noodle soup base ! The stir fried style noodles are a bit too greasy for my liking but I definitely would recommend the noodle soup !   Most of all the chilli sauce is also amazing ! Must try !"}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah. I'm back. Now I know what you're thinking. \"Hey Allen, if you hated it so much the first time, why did you come back?\"  I recently saw a post on blogTO about magic noodle and figured I should really give it another shot.  I'm glad I did! I came in during an off-peak time on purpose because last time I came in was very busy (as it usually gets here). My first impression of this place, with a fresh outlook, is that it's a quick and delicious and economical place to have a good lunch or dinner anytime. They're open hours are absurd from 11 a.m. until 5 a.m. the next day, which makes it very convenient for some. I came in and ordered the braised beef soup and was not disappointed. It came separately with the noodles and all the fresh greens in one bowl and the soup with the protein in the other and by mixing them together only when you're ready to eat it creates a really fresh and delicious meal. The only complaint I would have about the food that I received is that a couple pieces of beef were pure blubber, however the rest of it was so delicious it's almost not worth mentioning.   The reason I gave this place 3 out of 5 stars is because if you come in during on peak hours you're not going to be happy with the service. It's kind of hard to give a place a 5-star review that doesn't deliver consistency. I deducted another star because I have a problem with their options on the menu. As delicious as my braised beef soup was, there were really limited options, especially for vegetarians. I have to say, off the top of my head, I know more people that eat chicken than do haggis, but unfortunately chicken is not offered as a protein option, but you're in luck if you like haggis!  They only have lamb, beef, and pork. I can imagine that, as they are now a franchise, they should consider adding new options to their menu to cater to a wider audience (vegetarians, pescatarians, chicken, and vegan). But otherwise this place was quick economical and truly delicious for a quick bite before work."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because it's a two minute walk from my girlfriends house. We decided to try it today and they had good staff, cheap prices, but awful soup. It tasted like microwaved noodles with tasteless and badly cooked meat, and cheap bouillon cube broth. If you want good quality noodle soup, just get pho from pho hung on spadina for excellent soup at the exact same price. Not impressed at all"}
{"text":"We came to magic noodle around 9pm and it was still pretty busy, so it seemed promising. But when I first walked in I had that lamb smell hit me, which I don't particularly enjoy, but I thought it would be fine if I just didn't order lamb...  I ordered Triple B with hand pulled noodles. The noodles were alright. Not the pulled the best, since some were stuck together. But more importantly, the soup had the a gamy taste, which was a bit unpleasant. Also wish they would give more vegetables in the dish.  My friend ordered the pulled pork with sliced noodle, which actually tasted pretty good. But the noodles were cut a bit thick.  All in all, it was average."}
{"text":"Nice place. Was pretty quiet when I went. Quick service and polite staff, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The only thing magical about this place is all the bones in the broth that I had to pick out. The service was awful. And my standard for \"awful\" is the staff was not even able to refill the water at the table or get the bill right. I will definitely not be returning. Also, as a tip for those who unfortunately do go, they don't accept credit card yet they will still hand you a machine and not tell you it's debit or cash only."}
{"text":"The dishes are very simple, which means there is nothing for the ingredients to hide behind. With that being said, the noodles were amazing and tasted really fresh, the other aspects of the dish (beef, onions, etc...) were also pleasant and high quality. This was also a downfall though because I think that the dish was so simple that it lacked flavour. It was barely even salted and after more than a few bites, I wasn't really impressed as I was expecting something with more substance."}
{"text":"The vegetarian soup was so bland and not satisfying. The flavoured edamame was okay and the tofu was such a strange flavour. Super disappointed in my $50 order."}
{"text":"Their noodles are okay, but their broth can be definitely be more flavourful. It is quite light tasting. Good if you like that.  They pull their noodles and usually they display it proudly.  Not bad for a quick cheap eat."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle Bowl: Noodles are great. I loved that it's hand pulled and it absorbs the spicy chilli oil. But the soup doesn't make going out to eat worth it. I wish there was more to the bowl as well... some greens/onions and such would have been nice. They just give you some pickled turnips. The meat was okay - nothing special.  The spicy lamb skewers are an illusion. You're not actually eating lamb, you're only eating the spicy powder - as that's what it only tastes like, so initially you'll think it's good. It smells like lamb meat. However, it definitely does not taste and feel much like what lamb meat usually is, but it does come off as meat. Maybe it's too overcooked? Maybe it's over flavoured?   This place isn't bad but it's not good. I was still hungry at the end of the meal but I didn't want to order more because it was all so mediocre. I came home to make myself an egg sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Went here after work around 12am ordered food and patiently waited for about 35 minutes before calling it quits when our server came to retake our order. Prior to leaving we noticed two or three tables that came in after my friend and myself and within 10-15mins they each got their food and drinks before us. This is a Cantonese establishment and I feel if you don't speak the language you lose priority in service, we felt like outcasts."}
{"text":"Friend swears this is one of the better noodle places in downtown. I beg to differ.  Nothing was memorable. The service was meh. The noodles were forgettable and the portion of meat was small. Wouldn't come back again because it isn't that much of a deal/value. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my bf on a Sunday evening at around 6pm. It was busy but there were still a couple of seating options available so we didn't have to grab seats beforehand.  This joint is similar to other Chinese eateries where you order first at the counter, grab a table, and then a server brings your order to you. It was my first time here and I made the mistake of allowing my partner to order for me. He ordered stir fry noodles with chicken for himself, magic lamb for me, and lamb skewers to share.  The lamb skewers were the first to come out and they were sooo good! Cumin pairs really well with lamb. Cumin can be pretty strong in flavour but it didn't overpower the lamb.  The stir fried noodles were thicker cut than the hand pulled noodles and while they tasted good with the sauce and seasoning, it found the dish to be on the saltier side.  The magic lamb consisted of hand pulled noodles with lamb meat (with bones attached) in broth. While the noodles tasted good and had a nice bounce and chewiness to them, I found the broth to be on the blander side. There were also goji berries and other stuff in the broth that just gave it a slight Chinese herbal medicine taste to it which I'm not a fan of.  I would like to come back and try the Magic Chicken next time. The portions here are on the bigger side and while they are generous with the amount of noodles and broth, the bowls can use more protein."}
{"text":"This is a 24hr Chinese noodle restaurant it focuses on northern style as well as other styles of Chinese noodle. I went to this restaurant on a weekday, however this is not the first time i've been to this restaurant.    It is usually very busy and very popular among the community around there. we ordered two noodles and shared a bit. The noodle here is usually pretty standard, the service is fast and efficient when it comes to noodles. The BBQ meat however is not so much. the noodles are very authentic, and the soup is generally pretty flavorful. i would recommend the pork belly noodle as it is one of the more popular noodles, and good for people who also want to try the handmade noodles.      They are however not good at everything, outside of the noodles, they are not very good with their \"chinese hamburgers\" or some of the other snacks outside of BBQ meat. so i would hesitate to try those, as they are neither good nor authentic   This restaurant i would recommend for those who really love noodles. and want to try something from a different region of china."}
{"text":"First time here since I'm in the area. This is a 3.5 star from me. The service is quick and the atmosphere is pretty good. The food is very tasty and the fish ball noodle I had was good.  The downside is the first thing I didn't like when the food came the edge of the bowl is chipped. They should not serve chipped bowl because the particle can fall in the food and it can cut your lip. The fish ball has meat inside which is a bonus but a fish ball should not have meat that's why I order fish ball.  I would go again only after hour because it's 24/7 ."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the beef brisket noodle. The soup was little salty. Noodle was ok. I think the Scarborough location is better. Nice place to seat and chat since it is quite here in the late afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of time in the past and this will probably be our last visit. I ordered the beef brisket noodle and nom nom chicken. The beef brisket were completely inedible.. Hard and not even chewable... At least the broth was flavourful and noodles good. I noticed they are also pretty skimpy when it comes to toppings. Overall, quite a disappointing visit."}
{"text":"When my friend mentioned hand pulled noodles, I was immediately convinced to go. The texture of the noodle is what makes it for me and I can appreciate a good chewy consistency. It's so hard to find a good one as I feel like most care more about the broth flavours. This place definitely delivered in terms of the noodle texture. One of the best I've tried, but this is where it ends for my Magic Beef. The broth, while good, was nothing special. Same goes for the beef.  There were many other side dishes that looked delicious as well. I would definitely come back for the noodles because it's my thing and try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The classic noodle was really good! My friends and I all loved it. But there's another one, the Shanxi Daoxiaomian ?????, was not very good. The noodle was thick so there's no taste of the noodle itself.  We ordered 3 starters and they're all very good! Definitely worth of trying their starters!"}
{"text":"It used to be really good but I think it just keeps going downhill from here.."}
{"text":"Amazing place never disappointed. Staff very friendly and remember what u order. We are weekly customers."}
{"text":"\"NO MAGIC HERE!  Bland and Blah! Not Returning.\"  I knew eight people who had went before and had advised against it but I had to see for myself. Boy, was I disappointed! The noodles were bland and did not taste freshly pulled. Water has more taste than their broth for the braised pork noodle soup. The pork was very fat but at least it had some taste to it. The large is only marginally bigger than the small and we all had to go to MacDonald's next door afterwards as the servings, even the large is not filling enough.  I would rather go to Deer Gardens or Lemongrass nearby for yummy filling soup noodles. Or go to Shaangxi on Hwy 7 if you want delicious fresh pulled noodle."}
{"text":"I came here on the second day they opened so the place was packed. The design of the store make it difficult to find seat or carry your food. They food was mediocre as well as the drink. The service was slow and unfriendly, even worse than going to a fast food. The only good thing about this place is it runs 24 hours."}
{"text":"Food is ok but small portions. Very little meat in their noodles. Some tables are small, four adults cramped into one small square table. We asked to switch to a bigger table (three were empty) the 'manager' full on lied and said they are all reserved.   The food also don't justify the pictures on the menu at all. I ordered a spicy soup noodle but got clear broth. The egg was also way overcooked.   Ambiance is loud because they hand-make noodles so every ten minutes they make loud slapping noise. Probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle is good if you have no where else to go after 1:30AM, since it is a 24 hour restaurant. The place is small but usually, when I go with my friends, we only need to wait 10-15 minutes. The menu holds a lot of really good chicken and beef broth based soup noodles and they're very filling. I recommend all of their drinks, especially their mung bean smoothie. The service is great and if you're lucky, you might catch the noodle makers hand pulling their in house noodles. The price is also very reasonable. The only downside is that it is not very vegetarian friendly. They have SOME vegetarian dishes but they are cold noodles only. I would recommend this place for people who are having a hangover and need something hardy to eat haha"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch on my own when I passed by the u of t campus. It wasn't packed so the service was quick. It's an affordable northern Chinese (I thinks it's north west Chinese) fast (but not too unhealthy for you) noodles restaurant. I got the classic Lan Zhou Beef noodles which came with beef, green onions and cilantro on top. The bowl was huge and I was no where near finishing the entire bowl of noodles (so sorry for wasting food T_T). I probably wouldn't come here everyday since I don't live close by but will definitely check out their hand pulled noodles next time. Final verdict: I like the noodles but the beef broth was too salty."}
{"text":"This place is really horrible. The noodles were so hard and flavourless that my friend and I couldn't even finish the meal. The service was really bad, the guy didn't know what on earth he was doing. Although this place is really cheap, I might as well pay extra $ next time for actual food. Do not recommend.!.!.!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go after midnight. If you don't want fast food, you can get a freshly made noodle soup and some other Asian style bbq skewers and dishes. We went around 1am and you'll occasionally hear banging because of the fresh noodle preparation. There is a variety of flavours and dishes in their menu. I think there's something for everyone at this place. The prices are decent and nothing I've seen is too expensive (around 10 dollars for most things on the menu).  There is a bottle of water on the table with fresh lemon. The wait staff was pretty quick to seat us and was very patient when we ordered. When the soups arrived, I recommend getting a small because it's quite a generous portion. The only downside is the soup is a little on the greasy side, but the flavour is there. The fresh noodles were really tasty, slightly chewy and long. You're seated pretty close to everyone since it is a small space, but all in all, a good experience for me."}
{"text":"Came here around 2am because we were starving and nothing else was open. Oddly enough, the entire restaurant was full at this hour and we had to wait a bit before getting seated. People come in and out fairly quick, so the speed of the service was not a problem at all. With the restaurant being open 24/7, it is definitely convenient and accessible, especially for people who get hungry late at night and don't want to eat McDonald's (like me) so that's a big plus.   The noodles came in huge portions that I was unable to finish even though I was extremely hungry. The generous amount given with each bowl is certainly worth the inexpensive prices, but I would still suggest sharing a dish with someone else to save some money. The taste however was really bland in my opinion, so I probably wouldn't come back.   Also, the server kept spilling stuff everywhere - she got some soup on my jacket which left a stain and also dropped a dirty bowl that rolled off and could have hit someone. Not only did the apologies sound insincere, but it was hazardous and unprofessional. I pretty much left wishing I had just gone to McDs instead."}
{"text":"Decent place for late night eats and also available via Uber which is nice if you dont feel like leaving the house late night or want it waiting for you when you get back home from a late night out.   Noodles are decent, you add your sauces to give it the flavour you like, the meat quality wasnt great but hey this is magic noodle not magic noodle and meat lol  Def worth a try as a 24 hour late night option"}
{"text":"Great to go for a 24 hour place when you crave hand pulled noodles. It's of course a typical restaurant you would find in this area. It's cold in the winter, cleanliness is questionable, the guy at the front dropped a skewer on the floor, looked at it and put it back on the plate...what's new? Despite this, i will be coming back. Consistency is odd though as some days it will taste great while other days are unsatisfying. Wait time is usually quick. Sometimes busy at night. Skewers are pretty good (maybe the floor adds flavour). It is meant to be a quick \"what to eat at 2am?\" kinda restaurant."}
{"text":"The noddles is amazing .   Also the cold dishes are nice .   I like the beef seasoned with soy sauce,sliced pork tripe in soy sauce so much.."}
{"text":"Sigh...it is really hard to find good food. I saw the advertisement for this place and I was excited to try hand pulled noodles so I got my boyfriend to come eat here with me. He jokingly said we should eat mcds beside magic noodle, honestly I should have opt for that option better. Bf order the chicken friar fried noodle and I order the pork belly hand shaven noodle. Also in addition to the meal, I ordered the garlic wings. The waiter who came to took our order barely spoke , and when he did, he was whispering..no, he wasn't even whispering. He spoke so quiet , that we both couldn't even hear him. He barely made eye contact and when he punch the order in, it look like he doesn't even know how to do it. I told him to replace the bok Choy with shiitake mushrooms and add bean sprouts to my bowl. After ordering he comes back 12 minutes later and says he can't replace the mushrooms with bok choy, I told him it's fine as long as I have beansprouts and mushrooms in the bowl. A long wait later , bf got his noodles and starts eating and 10 minutes after I got my bowl. Keep in mind the wait is justified if it is busy but only me and my bf with two more people were there cause we came at night. My bowl came and there were no beansprouts , they took out the bok choy which is fine and add in TWO tiny pieces of mushroom..for 1$-$2? And that's what you get apparently. Portion of the food is both small, and the broth or sauce taste like Chinese medicine and bland. After a while , I was wondering when they will bring the garlic chicken wings?..as soon as we put our chopsticks down, that is the only time the waiter came to us to slap the bill down and we asked him if those wings will ever make it out. He looks soooo confused as if we spoke alien to him and I said we order those but I guess the waiter didn't pay attention and he said we didn't ordered it and made no attempt to say sorry or even tell the kitchen to make it. Both of us fed up with time and bland taste of food that we just paid and left."}
{"text":"I like their handmade and shaved noodles, it's not overly doughy and taste fresh.  However, I do think their soup bases and overall flavours could use some improvement. I ordered the beef brisket noodle over the weekend, and it was pure oil. Their appetizers are a bit stingy and of course customer service does not exist. I would still come back since it's one of the better handmade noodle places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came in at 3:30PM which is in between lunch and dinner, hoping the place wouldn't be too busy. And we were right!! Tons of tables open!   My BF got the hand pulled noodle soup with bbq pork. It was delicious! The broth wasn't salty with just the right amount of flavor. The bbq pork was good. Not very fatty, compared to Imagine Noodle which just opened in Scarborough.   Service is pretty fast when they are not busy. We sometimes have to wave for the servers to come to our table.  I got the shanxi beef burger. The bun is chewy. But it could have used more beef and most importantly, sauce. It was very dry. And there was not enough meat in my opinion. It was acceptable, I guess, for what you pay.  I would go back because I know Magic Noodle is number one when it comes to hand pulled noodles. I will use the technique of coming at 3:30 because then it is pretty dead."}
{"text":"This place still remains a solid option and good value for money in my opinion.  Perfect for those that are living on a student budget.  The hand-pulled noodles are still chewy and springy and provide moments of long slurpy deliciousness.  The few times where slurping is accepted and encouraged! :-)  Started with the Spiced Up Marriage which is a melange of beef tripe, beef lung, and regular beef.  I have always enjoyed dishes that highlight animal offal because those can be so tasty when done right.    Decided to try the BBQ buddies noodle bowl this time and it was as advertised.  There were good portions of the BBQ duck and BBQ pork piled on top of the noodles.  I asked for extra noodles and they definitely provided a noticeable amount more.  The soup still tasted clean and it wasn't oily due to the BBQ protein floating in the bowl.    The service is fast as usual because the noodles cook in minutes and depending on the time of day, you may have to wait a little bit before a seat opens up.  Another enjoyable experience. :-)"}
{"text":"Summary: popular noodle spot has great variety and is open late, but broth is somewhat bland across the board, and portion sizes are underwhelming  Top Must-Get: \"The Magic\" (signature dish) Top Regret: beef rolls (appetizer)  This is one of the most popular late night restaurants in the area. It's notably smaller than the Richmond Hill location, so sometimes you have to wait for a seat - but once you get a table, your eyes get to feast on a superb menu with options for everyone.   However, it's pretty much just your eyes that do the feasting - your tastebuds will be jealous: looks can be deceiving, and in this case, the products taste a bit underwhelming.  A broth can make or break a noodle soup, and unfortunately, the broth here is distinctly bland. It's not so bad if you add in sauces yourself, but it detracts from otherwise well-made noodles and a decent amount of meat.   I actually love their sliced noodles, but the blandness of the broth just ruins it.  The fried noodles come off as a bit too oily to me, too.  Big eaters can opt for extra meat and/or extra noodles, which I highly recommend as the regular portions consistently leave me with a bit too much room in my stomache.  The appetizers also lack flavour. Beef rolls (served while wrapped in aluminum foil) is one of my favourite appetizers, but the ones here do not have much meat nor sauce. The result isn't particularly impressive. This is true for most of their pastry-based apps, although the meat ones are slightly better.  All in all, Magic Noodle isn't a bad choice when it's super late and you need a quick meal - but it wouldn't be my number one option for noodles (unless I want to look at them on a menu)."}
{"text":"The only reason this is 3 stars is because the noodles are fresh and tasty. Service is ok/quick-ish too.   I ordered the shrimp wonton noodle. The wontons maybe have 1% shrimp in them - and I'm basing this off the response of the waitress \"it's pork and shrimp mixed\". It is literally a gumball sized piece of pork with wonton skin. Tastes exactly like the filling of a pork dumpling. Also my large game with like 6 wontons. The picture has the whole top of the bowl filled. Ok.   One other time I ordered the hand shaved noodles with pork belly. I found half a sticker that said Mexico on it. I guess someone forgot to take off the sticker when dicing up the cilantro.  Tasty. Does it make it Asian/Mexican fusion cuisine?  Skewers are also pretty good but I've only had tofu and squid tentacles.   Overall it's alright. If they didn't have fresh noodles, I would probably never come here. So they're good for noods and skewers."}
{"text":"My friend Larry took me to this joint for fresh made noodles. Was pretty impressed. I got the knife cut noodles and my husband got the hand strung noodles. Both were Cooked really well. Very eldante and the noodles didn't go soft while you ate it. Ordered a couple of sides as well... The lamb skewers are amazing but other side dishes I wouldn't bother. Nothing too good and it was kinda waste of money. Not much flavour and the dough was kinda soggy for the onion pan cakes . I would def come here for the noodles again tho.."}
{"text":"Came back from a short term missions trip and my father was super excited for us to try this noodle place he had just tried. Yep. Magic Noodle. What he did not know was that I've been to another one of their locations.  We were a party of five. We did get two noodle dishes that weren't particularly outstanding in my books. They were okay, but nothing I would find out of the ordinary. I actually prefer their small bites/side dishes to their mains.  Their BBQ squid (three different kinds, if I recall correctly), were more or less not worth the price. Their lamb skewers were tasty. Their tofu skewers were delightful. They've got a hoisin and perhaps cumin sauce on them, and they're very reasonably priced. Next time, I'm getting a bunch of these. Their spicy cold chicken dish was alright, as was their braised pork intestine, but I could probably skip these two and try some other things. They had a sesame cold noodle dish that was very tasty. I'd order that again. Their cold broccoli is my friend's favorite. The cold celery and peanuts dish is my grandfather's favorite. Their pancakes with pork (or was it beef?) were tasty. I'm now going off of my memory of a meal that was about a month ago...  I wouldn't crave Magic Noodle, but I would not be surprised if I came back with family and/or friends."}
{"text":"I ordered their magic beef signature noodle soup. It's okay. The soup stock is very Salty, the noodles are good though. They definitely have a fresh doughy taste which can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste and preferences."}
{"text":"Let me just comment on the service. They messed up our orders for two dishes out of five. When they finally (20 minutes later) got the right order to our table, the noodles were soggy and there were no soup left.  Also, some of the employees were unnecessarily rude. My sister left something in the restaurant and when we explained to them why we came back, one of them gave me the dirtiest look. They didn't even help us look for it; they just brushed it off. I guess they don't really care about customer service. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"The place is really good imo.. Highly recommended!.. Still as good as the one at Midland and McNicole"}
{"text":"Oh, magic noodle. I was enlightened to another dimension when I was introduced here by Dude.   Is this place ACTUALLY open 24h? Because that's insanity.   Taste was quite alright. I thought it would be dingy due to the long hours but quality's definitely up there. I had the Magic Pork and although it took me a while to disassemble the bone, the taste was good. Broth was super flavourful, thank you MSG!   Their snack menu looked great too, but I didn't try any. The portion sizes were mad decent.   Place is pretty busy but it's got a pretty big dining area so you don't feel cramped.   A big pull for me was that this place is relatively clean. Cutlery wasn't sticky or gross, and there's no residue from the previous customer. Hygiene at Asian places isn't usually top notch so I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times within 2 weeks! Good for casual family dinner, might be packed during lunch/dinner time.   Must try their bbq toufu skewer ( \"toufu Manchu\")! We ordered non-spicy. 6 minimum. Love their bbq sauce!  We always order one of their soup noodles if we dine in. It's average, portion is generous, and probably no msg cuz I don't feel thirsty afterward.  Stirring fired noodles are delicious and portion is generous. I always ordered hand-shaved noodle cuz the texture of the noodle absorbs the sauce and make it more flavorful and chewy. Remember to add the black vinegar and  some of their home-made fried garlic chili oil!  Spiced-up marriage (????) is always freshly made and one of our regulars. I always added a few drops of vinegar to make it more flavourful.  Magic scrolls is delicious, but Gamos are so so-a lot room to improve.   Service is good, lemon water , washroom is clean. Will be one of our regular dine-in / take-out places.  Oh, the lamb skewers might be one of their specialties but I had better ones."}
{"text":"The good: At least the employees are polite. The bad: We got overcharged and didn't get a refund, they screwed up a delivery order, and the food was very bland.   We got delivery from Magic Noodle in North York through UberEats and had several disappointing issues.  We ordered 2 slightly different bowls of Tree Hugger vegetarian noodle soup. The restaurant mixed up the details of our orders and added extra cilantro to a bowl when the request was for NO cilantro, which really sucks for someone who hates cilantro.  The soup's aroma was really enticing, but the flavor was unfortunately really bland across the board, and the broth was also kind of greasy. This could just be a preference thing, but this soup really didn't do it for us. The veggies were also delivered to us cold and had to be reheated.  The final straw was that the amount that was listed and charged to us via UberEats was $4 more per bowl than the amount the restaurant's physical receipt showed upon delivery (and what Magic Noodle's own menu lists). UberEats said that Magic Noodle is in charge of prices and told us to talk to the restaurant, and the manager at Magic Noodle said the price difference was UberEats' cut and to talk to UberEats. The employee and manager we talked to were polite in trying to explain their side, but neither the restaurant nor UberEats offered a refund or was ultimately helpful in resolving the issue.  Definitely not going back to Magic Noodle again."}
{"text":"I didn't find this place memorable at all, so I didn't write any reviews on it. But now, since I have a midterm this week, what better time to waste time than now? Live in the moment, am I right?  ANYWAYS! Magic Noodle is 'aight. The place is big, certainly bigger than the other one in scarbs. It's also clean and has that new restaurant look to it- let's see how long they can keep that up. Many times I go into this plaza, the restaurant is extremely crowded so I just avoid. It shares a small lot with mcdonalds and st Louis.. and also this other soup place nobody really goes to. Parking is hell during dinner rush, oh goodness...   The service is quick and blunt, and they all speak mandarin, which they'll sputter continuously out to you, even though you can't understand a word. The noodles come quickly, and they're mediocre. I know they're handpulled and it sure does look cool as they're throwing down the show, but it really tastes like nothing special. I love noodles but this wasn't doing it for me. I like the fact that I didn't taste any MSG in it, and the broth was fresh though. I also got this sweet potato pancake thing, and it was absolutely delicious. So yummy, although a bit oily. I'd so come back just to get it.   I'm not saying I wouldn't come back here, but is it worth all that hype? To the point where I can overhear people raving about it in public? Nah, son."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  A good representation of Taiwanese hand pulled noodles, made fresh in-house, served shaved to order.  For a satisfying lunch or late night dinner, Magic Noodle serves up a wide range of soup noodles and appetizers, the most enjoyable among them for me being their Pig's Ear and Pork Belly shaved soup noodle.  Additional soup for most shaved noodles is recommended as they tend to asborb the broth quickly and will often leave you with more noodle than you are able to have soup with.  Wait times are food are not long and service is on par with what you can expect from most mainstream Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Pros:If you're looking for a great place to eat after hours, this is a good place especially for a quick midnight meal after a party or karaoke. If you come here during regular hours, food is average and not bad. One of their best sellers is their stewed beef brisket noodle with their hand made noodles. The hand made noodles are fresh.  Cons: Sometimes you get too much soup and not enough noodles to go with the soup. Service is average during regular and after hours and especially when it's busy, it's hard to get service. I usually go here with friends when we can't decide where else to eat."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Magic Noodles. There's one in Scarborough near my house and it's always super packed. There's no doubt this downtown location will also do well. I ordered the Triple B Soup Noodle. The dish was quite food with good seasoning and very flavorful. The spice level was just right and not overpowering. I'm just a really big fan of hand pulled noodles. For the snacks, we ordered the Green Onion pancake. I love this dish every time that I ordered. Hands down, a great snack to share and recommend to others. Overall, great location and friendly staff. It does get busy during lunch time. Will definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my boyfriend. We came in on a rainy day, so the restaurant was not busy but not desert either. They had a place where you can leave your umbrella near the front door, which was convenient for people coming in from the rain.   This place basically serves hand pulled noodles in soup accompanied with different types of meat to choose, cilantro and scallions. We can also choose from 6 different size for the noodles (from \"silk string\" to \"curtain\"). The price is very decent. I think the small bowl is $7.99 and big bowl is 8.99  I had \"The Magic\" which is a combination of sliced beef, pork chop, fried egg, braised lamb, beef tripe, pickled turnip. They gave about 2-3 pieces/slices of each meat mentioned above (except fried egg). This is be a good choice for someone who would like to taste the different meats provided at Magic Noodle, or someone who doesn't know what to choose, like me, so I just go with the one which contains a little of everything.   Overall, the food was good, but I personally felt like there was too many mixtures of meat, and I will definitely try something more \"unique\" next time I go. Also, they have chilli and soy sauce on each table which you can add to your taste.   Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5"}
{"text":"Dinner was good until I watched the chef blow his nose into a paper towel and then go back and start rolling the dough without washing his hands or changing his gloves."}
{"text":"Chili oil.  This is a popular 24-hour noodle spot at Midland/McNicoll. Even late into the night, there is a high occupancy rate with high turnover. In fact, after about 45 minutes we were given our bill because by their standard, we had been there too long. I don't have an issue with this, because even at nearly 4am, they were still busy. Just an FYI for those who may be looking more for a spot to hang out rather than a quick meal.   Their menu is heavily focused on their fresh noodles made in-house, and there are many pages devoted to different soup base/noodle/meat combinations. They also have a grilled section where you can find skewers and other street foods.   I had the spicy pork intestine noodle soup. I've had pork intestine only once before and really liked it, so I jumped at the chance to order it here because it's quite a rare menu item.   My friend got the beef and ox tripe in chili sauce.  Our food came quickly enough and both dishes were delicious. The noodles had a distinct texture and taste that was different from premade noodles, and the meat was tender. The pork intestines were chewy and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my dish and it's definitely a go-to spot whenever I'm in the area late.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Very tasty noodles but loaded with tons of MSG so my throat suffered badly as the after effect. Been to the scarborough location a few times and I think this location has way better space and service but a smaller portion. I like their clear soup base noodles and their tofu skewer (very tasty). Freshly made noodles is good, we can choose thickness and wide noodles too if we like. Their hand cut noodles are good too. Minus 3 stars for the MSG, making great soup base without MSG is not that hard for a restaurant, why such shortcut?"}
{"text":"Someone say Beef Brisket and Rice Noodle Soup for brekkie?  Oh ya!  Tasty yum yum.  The restaurant is open at 6am and offer all sorts of Noodle soup dishes.  It was approximately 10am as I watched people walk into the restaurant.  I hadn't had anything to eat all morning and was starving so I decided to check the place out.  The restaurant was almost packed full of people eating noodle soup.  The space itself was very clean and what I liked most about the kitchen was that it was open concept.   I love restaurants where you can see the chefs cooking the food. The Beef Brisket Noodle soup was deliciously good.  The broth was tasty and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The beef was soft and tender and had a really nice flavour to it.  They didnt skimp out on the beef either.  Their pepper oil was a nice addition to my soups flavour. 10 bucks for my dish was money well spent."}
{"text":"One of the rare places that are opened 24/7 in the Uptown area (aside from McDonald's/Tims/Shoppers). I haven't gone here in the past, so I can't any comparisons with the difference in quality. I can say that it's a great noodle place.   I ordered the Lamb Noodle Soup ($7.49 small). I loved how warm the soup was. It had a flavourful lamb flavour with a hint of ginger. The noodles in itself were hand-pulled and had a bouncy texture. Superb! It had onions, a date and some goji berries in it as well as garnishes. The lamb was off the bone and I had about 6-7 small pieces so it's a lot more then I'd expect.  The pig ears ($4.99) were cut into thin slices and were soaking up a soy sauce. I loved it. You could eat it two ways: cold as is or soak it in the soup for a softer texture  They understand mandarin and english, but not cantonese. Debit and cash accepted!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place near my parents, love that the noodles are hand-pulled. My go-to is The Magic (#102) with mid-round noodles which I feel gives you a bit of everything.  For appetizers, their fried tofu is really good.  Restaurant is usually pretty busy but it's open 24 hours which is quite convenient. Service is quick and efficient. Only downside is that it's a bit cramped inside, so not a really a place you want to hang out and chat with friends for too long."}
{"text":"Waitresses are impolite. I walked in and the waitress didn't greet or say anything to us or lead us to our seat. Terrible service. They look like they don't want to work there. Food is mediocre. Would never go again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Awesome hand made noodles and very speedy service if you have 3-5 people.  It's a great place to eat and go.  It's not a good place to sit and talk because the restaurant is noisy and the seats are not comfortable.   The price is a little bit on the expensive side because a small bowl is $7.49 and about a dollar more for the large.  There isn't a real large difference between the two, quantity wise.  They also have a variety of side dishes."}
{"text":"I had the magic beef noodles.  The broth was much too salty and the beef was mostly fat and gristle.  There are so many better noodle places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, expect to wait 10-30 minutes for a table. There is nothing fancy about this little restaurant at all. It's all about the food here. I find the soup base to be very very flavourful, and their hand-made noodles are cooked al dente. All the noodle dishes are very very good. Their skewers are not up to par though. They are too dry, and tough. Either they need to marinate it longer, or use more fatty cuts of meat. Their cold appetizers are really good, flavourful, and the portion size is just right for 2 people to share. I wouldn't recommend getting any of their deep-fried dishes, they tend to be way too oily, every time. Most of my friends from China would say this place isn't authentic, and they had better noodles elsewhere. I think this place is still great, and considering their opinion of authenticity, would definitely recommend this place as a training-wheels for Northern China cuisine. I actually frequent this restaurant maybe once or twice a month in the late evening, they are open 24 hours. A large bowl of noodles for me every time!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry, on a budget, tight on time, AND in the area - Magic Noodle will satiate you but leave you wishing you chose a hearty bowl of top-notch ramen instead. Service is good and food arrives fast. We tried The Magic and GI Ju and both were decent. It's pretty cool to see the noodles being made on-site, though, so I can somewhat understand the \"hand-made\" appeal."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place for noodles since I go to U of T. I have been here more than 50 times (no exaggeration) since September 2016. I remember when they first opened they had lots of meat in The Magic--there was beef, pork, beef shank, chicken, and an egg. Throughout the year (around March), they started cutting the slice of chicken in half, but I still came here since the noodles were great and it was full of flavour and meat.   Fast forward to June 2017, I went back after not going for a month. The menu got renewed and now there are way fewer items, with most items being more expensive. I ordered The Magic like always. When it came, there was only beef slices; gone were the egg, the beef shanks, chicken, and the lamb. The soup also tasted like water (it used to be beef broth). I asked the waiter what happened, only to be told that they renewed their menu and that's what they had now. The waiter did add beef broth to my noodles, which tasted much better; nonetheless, there was only beef and I was extremely disappointed.   I don't think I'll be coming back or recommending this restaurant anymore. Super disappointing, since this was definitely one of my favourite places."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of noodle soups in Markham and Toronto, and although they have a location uptown, I'd unfortunately never heard of it, because this place is definitely one of my favourites (and less expensive!). The texture of the noodles is perfect and they have a really good flavour! And don't even get me started on the soup broth! Every time I go back, I expect to be disappointed because of how amazing I remember it tasting, but I never am! I've had the triple b, the magic lamb and the magic beef. The triple b was my favourite: it was a bit spicy (in the best way) and the brisket was so tender :) I really liked the other two flavour wise (and everything) as well, but I probably won't get the lamb again unless I'm craving it because I can't bother with the bones lol.   Ps: it's really cool seeing the guy behind the counter making the noodles by hand!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of noodles and came across this place thanks to yelp when i was searching for nearby noodle places.  This place did not disappoint!  Their selling point is they do their own noodles and thus, it's supposed to be super chewy and it lived up to that reputation!  I had their hand cut noodles and regular noodles already and both were amazing!!  Soup base is very flavorful and if you are into spicy noodle soup, this place has those as well.  My bowl of beef noodle soup was amazing, beef was very tender and noodle is so chewy!  One star off due to the a minor language barrier (they tend to speak mandarin only) and sometimes not as attentive.  If you go during lunch or dinner hours on weekends, good luck finding a table within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of school and I was starving! I found their noodle soup actually really good; not because I was starving lols. I had their house special, which included various topping. They have two selection of noodles, thick and thin. I tried both and I really don't have a preference. Imo the thick one is a bit more unique to have. The broth was tasty and I loved how every bite I had always had a different topping, such as tripe, radish, porkchop, beef, Bok Choy etc. Definitely had my noodle fix. Place is clean and they give complimentary lemon water."}
{"text":"I normally love this place! But tried out their online ordering and when i arrived to pick up they said they didnt know of my order and i sat there and waited for them to make it ."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations. Apparently, this place used to be a lot better (more generous meats and better service). Well, too bad.  I have had better hand-pulled noodles at other places . The food was below average. It was packed when we got there (Sat. just before noon). They didn't have enough staff to serve tables. We had to ask for water and wait for a long time to place the order. I managed to take a picture of my dish to look like it has a good amount of meats. The ones shown in the picture was it. Nothing beneath the noodles. Soup was bland, not much flavour to it.   Overall, I won't be back here. I don't recommend this place if you want to have good soup noodles. I don't know about other dishes. As their name indicates, they specialize in noodles....so chances are...other dishes are not worth trying."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places where I can get my favourite knife sliced noodles. They do a fantastic job with the noodles. I greatly recommend it for those who like chewy, thick, and textured noodles or just want to try something new! I would recommend the lamb noodles as every time I got it, it was good. However, I can't say the same for the signature noodles. Half the time, either I or someone I am with orders it, they are disappointed. It's either because there is a lack of flavour, too salty, or they are missing some of the toppings. A BIG HIT OR MISS.  The side dishes are also a hit or miss. I don't recommend the cold dishes but the sizzling side dishes are pretty good. My favourite being the lamb skewers. =)"}
{"text":"You would never know that one restaurant had closed and a new one opened by the interior.  But I noticed a new sign and stopped in for lunch.   I had a noodle soup dish, and like the old place, it was just as good. I need to come back and try a few more dishes, there might be some new items that will get my attention.   Service is fast, they make the effort to communicate the menu options, and the servers remain attentive. As winter approaches, I can see a lot more visits in my future.  I'll update in any new dishes I discover."}
{"text":"Small restaurant.  Supposed to be known for their noodles.  Was okay.  You get to see the chefs behind the scenes prep the noodles from scratch.  My prob at the moment is the after-taste which I'm burping out...Bleah.  Trying to wash it down with a brandy and coke at the same time.  What is it that I consumed?  The sliced noodle with traditional braised pork.  It must be the herb content added to the soup which is causing this bleah after-burp."}
{"text":"This place is supposedly pseudo-famous for its hand-made noodles.  Indeed, upon entering you can see them hand-stretching the noodles at the back - quite an interesting process!  Anyways, on to the review..  Location - wow parking mayhem.  Coming Friday at 12:30pm is not ideal - this place is a fricking zoo.  Indoors was packed as well but fortunately got in pretty quickly after about 5-10 minutes of waiting.    Food - menus are clear and nicely illustrated, though choosing the thickness of the noodles is a crapshoot - you basically choose one of 5 or 6 thicknesses from a miniscule thumbnail picture where it's impossible to tell what they actually look like.  I chose something in the middle which turned out to be about twice the thickness of spaghetti.  Proceeded to order their standard beef soup and it was quite nice - the noodles were, well, noodles, and the broth and meat were reminiscent of pho.  Actually, if you just replaced the wheat noodles with rice noodles, you couldn't pho'led me (har har) into thinking this was a Viet soup.  Anyways, it was ok, but nothing spectacular.  As for other food, the lamb skewer ordered as a side actually tasted nothing like lamb to me and was overly spicy, but perhaps I'm comparing too much to a western preparation where the lamb's natural gaminess comes through more.    Service - food came quickly, but as with most busy Eastern food establishments, for anything additional a server had to be flagged down, including ordering and paying.    Overall, a decent experience, though nothing to write home about.  I'd come back if the need for noodles resurfaces."}
{"text":"Found a nail in our friends food. All we got was \"Sorry for nail. Here's new bowl and 10% discount\". Food wasn't that good."}
{"text":"This location is really close to home and is a good way to get the Northern Chinese fix.  Our kids often see this place on the way home and want to come back.  It's also conveniently located next to a McDonald's and St Louis Wings.  So it's always a toss up when we come to this plaza what they really want.  We've been here about 5 times now and previously I would have given it 4 stars.  I think that 3 stars is more appropriate.  The hand-pulled noodles are still tasty but most of the portions for toppings like meats and such are on the skimpier side.  Fried noodles are good but too greasy -- same for appetizers like the beef wraps or chive pancake.  I do wonder if this style of Northern Chinese cooking just calls for more salt and oil.  We were feeling pretty thirsty after lunch.  If you have small kids, they may not appreciate the cook slapping the noodle dough really loudly on the counter.  Our son was still covering his ears due to the loud noises."}
{"text":"had the hand-pulled noodles w/ beef noodles were not QQ despite being freshly made in fact, it was slightly soggy  the broth & meat were just okay  if i do come back, it would be from 2-5am 'cause they open 24/7"}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the others. Not sure if it's the 24/7 store hours that affected quality. Noodles are alright, and very little meat in the soup."}
{"text":"Had the brisket ramen and what I wanted up with was more veins and fat then anything that resembled beef brisket.  Broth was OK and the noodles were indeed good but not sure if I would go back"}
{"text":"Noodle's better than the average, but watching the guys making noodle is a lot more fun. Since their open 24/7, I would recommend it this place."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Sunday afternoon around 1-2. The parking lot is small here so it may be hard to find parking depending on what time you come. We had to wait around 10 minutes for a table for 5. I thought the tables could be spread out a bit more so that it is more spacious as i felt quite close to the neighbouring table. The table came with a pitcher of water with lemon slices in it as opposed to normal cold water which I thought was nice.   They were quite busy when I arrived but it was not hard to get the attention of a waiter as there were quite a few employees working there. We each ordered a bowl of noodles and a side dish. The side dish only took a couple of minutes to come out and the noodles came out not long after. Overall fast service.   I ordered a small bowl of the short rib noodles. I thought the noodles themselves were good but then the short ribs were tough to chew. I would not recommend this dish.   There was actually a surprisingly large amount of noodles as the bowl did not look that big but it was actually quite deep. Everybody at my table was very full by the time they finished their meal.   After we finished our noodles we sat there for a couple minutes to rest and then a waiter brought us our bill without us even asking for it. I understand how there were people waiting for a table but they could have at least let us sit a bit longer before handing us our bill. I guess this is how they get a fast turnover and why our wait time wasn't too long.   The place should turn up their air conditioning since everybody at my table got quite hot after eating our noodles.   I enjoyed the noodles themselves so I'll probably be back next time to try another noodle bowl."}
{"text":"Cute little noodle place close to home that's serving up some delicious comfort food.  Known for its noodle soups, hand pulled noodles, etc. their menu has a lot of options that can cater a range of clientele.  The ambiance is clean, contemporary and open with plenty of seating arrangements for those busy times. We came here on a Sunday afternoon and after some thought I went for their #102 - The Magic beef stock, sliced beef, fried egg, cilantro and scallions in a spicy broth.  Portion and presentation was pretty good and the food came out FAST!!!   Jen had the hand shaven noodles, hmmm not a fan of that. Thankfully hand pulled noodles is the way to go!   Overall I had a great experience and i'll definitely be back to try the other options available."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times. I enjoy their hand-pulled noodles and their skewers. However their soup is not great (has MSG) and the amount of meat you get with the noodles is pitiful!! I ordered a hand-pulled beef brisket noodle to-go a while ago. Only when I opened the containers and ready to eat did I found out there were only 2 small pieces of beef in there, the rest were fat. And this wasn't just one takeout experience, but several times. When you dine in the restaurant, they seem to give you a bit more meat (still not alot but definitely more than takeout) then if you do takeout, which I think is horrible. I should get the same amount of meat regardless of dine in or takeout! Oh well. Still a not-too-bad place to eat if you are hungry late night - they do open 24/7 :)"}
{"text":"I went here with two friends in the afternoon after hearing about it from one of them and on the media. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the price. I also loved the fact that they offer cold dishes that you can eat with beer. It's very reasonable and tastes great. The only thing is that the noodles my friend ordered did not have much broth and a bit salty. I think it's more of a dry dish. However, the overall experience was really good. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very decent 24/7 noodle restaurant. I got the Triple B noodles and the chive pocket. The noodles were more on the salty side and the broth was pretty oily but all in all it was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"To be honest, the MAGIC BEEF didn't seem all that 'magical'. Broth was average, warm (not hot). Biggest issue, small space is crammed, lines at and outside the entrance. The design (shifting tables is cumbersome, booths are fine). Experience felt more like work than pleasure. If was almost 9 pm, so it's busy and often."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional northern Chinese noodles. There aren't many northern noodle places downtown so this place is a gem. The broth are a tad salty though, otherwise very tasty."}
{"text":"Magic noodle is definitely a go to place when you're craving for some daily hand made noodles. They are open 24/7 but are always busy. You probably have to wait in line for quite a bit at the busier times of the day but other than that its worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had lamb skewer and tofu skewer, Steamed Chicken with Hot Sauce, Magic Noodle Signature Beef Soup Noodle.  After the meal I bought House Special Pork Burger, and Flavored Beef Wrap for takeout as lunch for tomorrow.   The delicious noodle soup is very good for cold weather. And they operate until 2AM, which is quite unique since this is not a fastfood or bar."}
{"text":"This place was a great find. Open 24 hours for a bowl of hand pulled soup noodles? If only this were closer to where I live. You get to choose the thickness of your noodles, but I played it safe and went with the normal size. They came out nice and chewy, and the broth was hot. Broth could have had more flavour, but that's me just being picky. All in all, I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area"}
{"text":"24 hours. Nice hand pulled noodles but i prefer the sliced noodles. Braised briskets the way to go. Good size and speed. Awful snacks. Would go again. Can't be too picky with these type of joints. Better in the winter. Lights are too bright and floors too moist. Awful chairs."}
{"text":"Love this place for their Magic Noodle Soup. Noodles are made right before they boiled them for me. Broth is not too fat , as I like. Couple peaces of beef and little bit of cilantro. Tastes Great!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at the new Magic Noodle location at Richmond Hill. This location is at least twice the size of the Midland and the wait is considerably less. The seats are also more spacious and comfortable as well. There is also bar seating near the wall, which is great for solo diners.  Magic noodle is THE place to go for noodle soup. The noodles are made fresh and hand-pulled right in front of you. You can choose from different types of noodles and choose the thickness as well. I ordered the traditional lanzhou noodle with beef (?????). The noodles are perfectly chewy (al dente) and the broth is sweet. You can even add more broth for free if you find yourself running low on soup!   There is also a large selection of snacks and skewers available from from pancakes to cold dishes. For snacks, we had ordered the spicy pork lung and tripe. and the seaweed salad. Both dishes pair well with noodle soup and refreshing. As well, the skewers always come out hot and fresh. The tofu skewer is a favourite. The tofu crispy and it's slathered with a sweet chinese bbq sauce. The only flaw, is sometimes they put too much sauce and it can be overpowering. Lamb skewers are also another popular choice. The lamb is juicy and seasoned with plenty of spice, delicious!   The service here is hit or miss. The restaurant gets so busy, the staff is always getting pulled left and right. It can be difficult to get the attention of the staff but understandable as the restaurant is packed. However, the food will keep bringing me back :)"}
{"text":"**BAD SERVICE**  This place is always busy especially on a weekend or Friday night. But the good thing is they give you a beeper and when you're table is ready, the electronic device beeps and you know to head back to the restaurant. Very convenient if you don't want to squish inside and get in the way of people walking in and out. Wait time is usually 15-20mins.  The place is quite small so as for their tables, if you're in a group of 4 and get one of the square tables, having a bowl each on it is ridiculous, there's basically no space you can place your bowls, nerveless the side dishes which you have ordered! In order for them to max out the seating space, they have stool along the walls where you can face the wall to eat.   There's basically no service here, so don't expect any! They just sit you down and give you a bowl of WARM lemon tap water which you self serve. The menu is pretty simple, noodles, rice, side dishes nothing too fancy or unusual but PLENTY of pictures in case you don't understand what it is, which I find great!  We ordered a few side dishes, the lamb skewers and pig ears to share for the table. And each one of us ordered a bowl of noodles. Noodles don't come at the same time even though you ordered at the same time. We waited 15mins from the first to the last bowl so we could eat at the same time. Noodles tasted great, as well as the soup but as to portion size, it was LITTLE! The side dishes were also good! I would recommend ordering the pig ears and lamb skewers.  As we finished and wanted our bill, they brought us a new bowl of noodles and charged us for it. We told them we didn't order and the fact that we didn't place a second order and we were clearly finished eating, they were so confused! They brought it back to the kitchen and came out again with the same noodles to our table and asked if we could pay for it and take it home! After a 10min discussion, they finally agreed on removing it from the bill.  Terrible communication and forcing customer to pay for something they did not order! Very bad service because they don't care! Would come back again for the FOOD but hate the service!!"}
{"text":"Had the magic beef, it was good - the huge plus for me was the noodles as well as the option of adding extra noodles for just $1. Service was good, they give you lemon water!!! Totally beats getting regular tap water. Not all the options from the website are shown on the in store menu, so I'm not sure if there's a secret menu or they just don't have it."}
{"text":"My first experience with Magic Noodle (down in Scarborough) was not a memorable one and this location has not done much to change that. At first glance you may be lead to believe that this place is off-the-charts delicious but don't like the large crowd fool you! I have to give kudos to their noodles. There' something about hand-pulled noodles; tender and soft all the while still remaining al-dente. The various soup stocks they offer are bland at best and the meats are negligible. Most of their snacks and small eats are again negligible. There are highs however, most notably the skewers are tender, juicy and pack a good flavour punch! Also the stir fried noodles are to-die-for. Absolutely greasy and delicious."}
{"text":"What we had: Braised beef noodle, lamb soup noodle, noodle with pork belly, stir-fried sliced noodles ShangHai style, stir-fried sliced noodles GuangDong style, stir-fried sliced noodles XinJiang style (tried both sliced and hand pulled noodles, sliced noodles are chewier and don't get soggy), a crapton of skewers of all sorts (This was over multiple visits, our stomachs are not that big.)  Taste: 10/10   Our go-to noodle place. Great broth, great sliced noodles. Stir fried noodles are a little inconsistent in terms of amount of salt and other ingredients, but overall pretty good. Lamb skewers are tender, flavorful (spicy with cumin, just like the ones you get on the streets in China before street food in China became ultra sketch), and delicioussss. Best lamb skewers we've had in Canada. Other skewers are OK but why get the others when you can have a crapton of lamb skewers?  Value: 9/10  Prices for skewers are pretty on par with other Chinese skewer places, but these skewers taste better. Noodle prices are fair too. $15 (after tax) per person will get you full and some more.   **Average cost per diner: 15$ After Tax+Tip  Service/Convenience: 5/10  Finding a parking spot is almost impossible at regular meal times. Also the parking lot isn't very spacious so it's a one-way path going around the lot. This place is also super busy during regular meal times so you'll probably have to wait 15-20 min. Service is not super fast but fast enough given how busy they are, you get a jug of water at the table so you don't have to try to flag the waiting staff down for water.   Once they got my order wrong and when I politely insisted on having what I ordered, the waitress was visibly annoyed. She gave me my order nevertheless. Could be more professional; I wasn't even being rude nor was I asking for special treatment, and they weren't very busy that day. All the other times we went were smooth sail in terms of service.  Edit additional note: In Chinese restaurants, you typically have to wave at the wait staff to get their attention for taking orders and other needs. If you just sit there and wait for them to come fawn over you, you will be waiting for a loooong time. This is standard service level and most efficient. Also, servers usually do not come check on you. To them, no news is good news. You only wave them down during the meal if you need something or have a complaint.  Would go back? Definitely, whenever I'm down for some soup noodles. (At least once a month.)  Would recommend to friend? Yes, the sliced noodles and the lamb kebabs.  Similar places: None as far as we know.  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"What I like about Magic Noodle is that the chef actually makes the noodle in front of everyone.. So they weren't kidding about handmade noodles! Haha  I'd recommend the LAMB and TOFU SKEWERS - so yummy! I like the sauce they marinate it with.. It's both sweet & spicy.  I ordered the imitation crab & fish/meatballs noodles, it is more on the light end of taste buds - I'll come back again to try the Taiwanese Beef Noodles ( ?????)."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles does make a difference. It's an alright place to grab a quick bowl of noodle to satisfy that noodle craving. Just be prepared for the sporadic \"bang\" from the sound of dough hitting the table...the violent process of noodle making. I like the lamb soup noodles because the broth is quite clear and not too salty. They have different noodle shapes to choose from so whether you like thick or thin noodles, you'll find noodles you like. I do have to mention the poor customer service especially from the manager (at least she seemed like the manager, you'll recognize her)."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle is a franchise chinese ramen restaurant that make hand pulled noodles to order. Personally, I prefer Chinese Ramen to Japanese Ramen. There are just so much more herbal chinese flavours in the soup.   My favourite is the Magic. I like my noodles extra thin or regular depending on the day. The portion is large enough for the average eater but for big eaters, you can add extra noodles. I never finish the noodles because its a large portion. The deep fried chicken is fantastic but the portion is a bit small for $5.   There are no reservations unless you are a larger party. I recommend you read the menu before you get there and order right away! The service is a bit slow but the ramen is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"A fine place for Chinese-style meat + noodle + soup. Noodles are handmade by the chef right beside the tables. The service was fast."}
{"text":"This place is a Small Joint. All their noodles are hand made to order! We came here to celebrate a belated birthday with a friend of ours. It was around 7pm when we got there and it was packed. There was no table for 3, so we waited around 10 mins or so for a table. I was checking out their menu while waiting, and I love their menu design. Their menu was like a Food & Drink Magazine Spread.   Our menu:  1. Knifed Sliced Noodles with Braised Pork The noodles were made and cooked right in front of us. The noodles had a chewy texture, which was quite nice. The braised pork was so-so. The noodles really absorbed the broth, so you really have to eat quick, or ask for more broth next time.  2 Sizzling Tofu It was fried tofu squares marinated in a ma pao tofu sauce. A ting of spice,  it was quite yummy.  3. Hand-Pulled Special House Noodles Noodles had a nice texture, meat and egg was a bit over done.  4. Hand-Pulled Spicy Pork Intestines I enjoyed mine the most.  The noodle texture was excellent, nice chewiness and texture. The broth was to my liking of spice level. But there wasn't enough intestines in my opinion.  Overall, the place was a great place to eat with the added bonus of the noodles made on the spot. I subtracted a star because the water jugs were kind of murky."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle hit the spot for our noodle cravings! I'm not sure where the poor reviews are coming from as we had a pretty positive experience here. They're open 24/7, and also do take out.   The noodles are hand pulled in house and the broth is super fresh! You can choose from several noodle variations: silk string, classic, mid round, mid triad, mid flat, ribbon, curtain or hand shaved. The menu naming is quite fun - such as Hear Me Oink, Nom Nom Chicken, G.I. Ju, etc. The Magic Beef and The Magic seem to be the most popular dishes.  Tree Hugger - Vegetable stock, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, fried egg, bok choy. An excellent choice for those vegetarians or those who want more veggies.  Magic Chicken - Chicken & pork stock, pan-fried chicken filet, cilantro, scallions. The chicken filet is huge! Would recommend.  The portions for the noodles are very generous, and we really liked the food here!"}
{"text":"Saw BlogTO's latest article on the new location of Magic Noodle on Harbord and discovered I live close to the one in Scarborough...  Figured I'd give this Scarborough location a try and I haven't been underwhelmed by a restaurant in a while... Seating was fairly cramped (they're really going for maximizing the number of customers in their unit space) -- it was awkward getting up or flagging wait staff because you'd end up smacking the person at the next table.  Ordered the Triple B (Beef Stock / Braised Beef Brisket / Pickled Tumip / Cilantro / Scallions ), The Magic (Beef Stock / Sliced Beef / Pulled Chicken . Fried Egg / Braised Lamb / Beef Tripe / Pickled Turnip / Cilantro / Scallions), and Pork Flats.  The Magic... was not what we expected -- it didn't even have a lot of toppings in it, nor did it look like the photo in the menu.  The Triple B only had one slice of turnip and less brisket than I thought there'd be.  The only thing that came as expected was the Pork Flats (even then it was just mediocre).  The soup base for both seemed like they just mixed in broth intended for the lamb noodles because I could taste a bit of mutton in it (also they mixed in a bit of kidney beans???).  The noodles themselves were actually the only good thing from the meal...  Skimmed some reviews before posting and noticed that some people have commented on the noticeable drop in quality of food... maybe I was just unlucky, or maybe it's what it is now.  Don't think I'll be coming back to this location but am willing to try the Harbord and Richmond Hill locations to see if they're any better."}
{"text":"Very convenient location near campus and good for both eating with friends and grabbing a quick lunch by yourself. Service was also reasonably prompt and friendly.  I got the Morning Sunshine (hand-pulled noodles with tomato & egg sauce); noodles were quite good - nice and chewy - but the sauce was just average, something I could make myself at home. It didn't look like a large portion in the big bowl but they actually give you a LOT of noodles.  All in all, great for an easy meal on campus. Unfortunately, they have very limited vegetarian/seafood options so I probably won't be going back often."}
{"text":"Pretty legit northwest ?? food. . .  For Toronto . Their beef noodle soup was more authentic than their Beijing Bang ??? which I found to be too sweet. Their lamb and tofu skewers were yummy even if hoisin sauce on the tofu is not very typical of that region. Their Rou Jiamo like the Chinese version of a Sloppy Joe were decent but we are used to them being full of messy fatty pork or beef. These were a bit dry and the bun was not right and seemed as if it had been reheated. Would like to see some faves such as biang biang noodles or dapan ji or Lanzhou la mian and the like. It would be nice to have less fusion and more focus. No one goes here to eat egg rolls or if they do they should have the chopsticks slapped out of their hands."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle is a solid after hours spot. That being said, it can usually have a long wait. My group of five took maybe over twenty minutes or so before we got seated. On the bright side , the food came out relatively quick. I'll have to say within minutes of ordering   I ordered a large tender Riblet and it was around $10 CAN with tip. I feel it was well worth it for the portion and variety they offered. I must say they service was kinda disappointing. One of the guys in my group did not get what he ordered and apparently he just took the meal since he was afraid they would spit in our food. Not sure what the fear was about since it was my first time experiencing the location.   It was kinda far off and off aside to where we were staying at, so I don't think I will be venturing here too often but it's a good hidden gem if you need something to eat when it's late since it is 24.7."}
{"text":"Big portions. Awesome pulled and cut noodles. Chewy and good texture. Delicious tofu skewer. I came on a cold morning. The place was clean. The restaurant was half full at 10AM. Good service with good prices. I recommend coming here at all hours. It is 24 hours after all."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for a while now. Finally had the chance and it was definitely a good surprise to see the place packed close to 2pm on a Sunday. It was nice to see the menu had pictures of most of their popular items so you get an idea of what you're ordering. The noodles were firm and bouncy so that was really enjoyable. What I didn't like was the beef was a bit small and chewy. The soup wasn't super flavourful either. But I'll still come back to try other flavours."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of Noodle houses. I would leave that for a good Pho shop or something like that, but I have to admit that Magic Noodle was pretty good. Given the location, it would take a lot of convincing for me to go here over some of the other restaurants in the plaza, but it is definitely a competitive option. I decided to go with the house bowl and try some of their hand made noodles. The noodles were definitely the star of the dish! I haven't had anything like that in awhile. If I feel like getting a noodle bowl, this is definitely one of my new go to spots."}
{"text":"3 stars for food - good side dishes, beef broth & noodles, and one of the few places I know that opens late.   Worst service ever, on multiple occasions but the most recent visit prompted me to write this. I don't expect much but we all deserve basic respect. I ordered the beef noodle and was given the noodle with egg (overcooked) & pork. I waved to the server and he mumbled \"chili oil on the side[table]\" - which was not even my question. He came over with a menu so I could verify that my order was wrong, and responded with no emotion, no eye contact \"it's the same. Same broth. Same beef......do you still want it?\" Obviously it's not the same - beef and egg & pork are not the same thing. The beef was tiny bits unlike the photo showing large slices. But I still kept it as I didn't want to waste food. I read a google review that described the staff as 'walking zombie' - pretty accurate description."}
{"text":"Dropped in for some beef noodles and lamb skewers. We also tried the noodle with tomatoes and eggs - it reminded me of chef boyardee from a can. Lamb skewers were good. Beef noodle soup was ok, nothing special.  I've driven by and seen super long line ups and I finally figured out why. The menu and prices say it all. This place is like a cheap noodle dive. The prices are very low and super affordable, and the food comes pretty fast. It's good for a quick in-and-out. The food quality is so-so, nothing special, except their corresponding low price. The wait service is bad, they're rude and just want people in and out. We were seated at a table, where soup was spilled on the chair, so I asked the waiter to wipe it, and he did so VERY reluctantly, rolling his eyes and didn't even clean it all off. We asked for an extra napkin and chop sticks and again, EYES ROLLING, and SIGHING - seriously? Yes, this happened!  I really don't think these people understand what common courtesy is or what it means to work in food service. Good service = high tips $$, but not to worry because the service is so terrible here, you'll get to save even more money by tipping very little or not at all. The service is below average for a Chinese restaurant. I'd rather pay an extra couple bucks and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I know that some of the dishes in this restaurant may not be the greatest. But the two times that I've been there I've always ordered the same beef noodles with thick hand pulled noodles. It reminds me of my childhood beef noodles back home, in Asia. I'd give this noodle dish a five star. It was awesome..... But I know the rest of the noodle items were just not bad, however my kids still loved it. The grilled items are not that great although they are priced fairly low, I wouldn't even waste money on them. I don't know if it's true but I taste a lot of MSG. I didn't mind it for my noodles because that's how it is when you eat out. But for the kids, I'd think twice about giving them the soup from there."}
{"text":"There's one of these uptown in Richmond Hill that I've been to. This one is comparable and a nice addition to the neighbourhood. They do the hand-pulled noodle technique that many restaurants are doing now near and in chinatown, which is great for competition and choices.  I've gotten most of the soup/noodle dishes here and they are decent in size. I usually get extra noodle and a side for myself and my wife. It's just the right amount although we could finish two noodle bowls separately if we wanted to. The extra noodles are only $1 so it's an easy choice, however, the base prices are higher than others such as handmade ramen on Spadina. The meats are average and sometimes dry (e.g. lamb or beef brisket).  I would go here if you're in the neighbourhood and craving noodles but wouldn't go out of my way to check it out."}
{"text":"Quite underwhelming. I feel like ramen is pretty simple, and this restaurant managed to present very mediocre bowls of noodles. I ordered a small with bbq duck, chicken, and choy. The picture on the menu displayed upwards of 10 slices of meat and at least 5 stalks of vegetables. What I ended up with was about 4 slices of meat and maybe 2 tiny stalks of greens. I also found the noodles slightly undercooked. Overall, the meal could've been much better.   I will say that service was extremely fast. We got our orders in two minutes, so we were in and out within half an hour. However, there are much better places to fill up on noodles."}
{"text":"Really great first impression. My husband and I went and had soup noodles and a full spicy squid. I liked that the chili oil was on the side so you can add as much as you like. They also offer free extra soup, I wasn't feeling 100% so I had mine gone pretty fast and the waitress came over and offered more.   I don't do pork so they gave me more beef and made sure the kitchen staff knew so they wouldn't use the same utensils.   Over all it was fantastic, definitely will be back for something else."}
{"text":"Noodles are freshly made and good, but toppings were mediocre quality. Fried noodles are too oily."}
{"text":"Alright folks, this is my 3rd review of the same place. I guess Yelp likes it more when people review different places since they don't count repeated reviews as \"new\". Today is Saturday and it was absolutely jam packed there. The only reason I got a seat right away was because I went my by myself and sat on one of the stools in between two other guys. Nonetheless, the food was very good and the service was average as well.   Let me first start off by saying if you are looking for a place that's quiet and serene and has excellent service, this is not the place to go because this is a Chinese restaurant. It is not the same as western restaurants. This is the nature of Chinese  restaurants. It is rustic, noisy, loud, and the food is good! Or at least should be good!   I ordered the knife shaven noodles again today with BEEF not pork belly. The beef was good, and the noodles had a perfect texture once again. I like a place that is consistently good. The beef is braised, then chilled, then sliced into slices. Yes, it is still VERY tender and melt in your mouth even though it might look like it on the picture I took.  I also ordered one spicy lamb kabob. For those of you who are chinese, this is yang rou Chuar. I don't know how to write chinese so the best I can do for all of you is write pin yin. This kabob was good, for the price or 2.99 or 1.99 you get a good amount of perfectly seasoned hot lamb meat. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth. Thinking about this right now is making me salivating. The seasoning has a punch to it and is spicy do be careful! You might want a glass of water on the side just incase shit hits the fan. Also, the tofu kabobs are also the shit. They are beyond perfectly seasoned and cooker. Lightly crisped on the outside and lighter than a cloud inside. The seasoning is a mix of chilli peppers, cumin, black pepper, and hoisin sauce for the tofu. For the lamb there is no hoisin sauce, that ain't traditional.   This place continues to impress me and obviously I'm not the only one who thinks so because this place is constantly full on weekends and weekdays. The food is what matters and they are killing it. The price isn't bad also and it's in a very nice location.   Will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Freshly hand pulled noodles are brought to their full potential in Magic Noodle's savoury broths. Certain pitfalls exist, but what Magic Noodles does best is pretty special. Open 24/7 for business, it's ready for your business around the clock.   I am a frequent customer at Magic Noodles. There was a time last summer where I ate here at least twice a week. This means I've tried almost everything on the menu. Which by the way, is no easy feat.   There is quite a selection of noodle bowls here. They are split between hand pulled noodles and shaved noodles. Shaved noodles are made using a medium sized metal apparatus that \"shaves\" thin slices from a big piece of dough. However, despite having many flavours and choices, it really boils down to pork broth, lamb broth, and beef broth. All are really good.   There are three staples that I order. One is the beef tendon noodle soup, another is the lamb noodle soup, and finally I order the house special, which is pork based. Pick any one of these and you'll find yourself very satisfied.   What makes this place even more special is the price. You can have a large bowl of noodles here for under $10. If you combine the quality and the cost, this place is hard to find alternatives indeed.   Now onto the pitfalls. It's a very crowded place. Management wanted to cram as many people as they can into a very small space. This not only means you might be seated uncomfortably close to strangers (I'm talking about elbows almost touching), it also means really long wait times during peak hours. On top of that, service here is really subpar. Over the period I been a customer, they have gradually increased number of staff. However, this only made everything more fanatic. The wait staff cannot seem to manage high traffic or multitask. Increasing their numbers only seem to make them more confused and less organized. This means forgotten orders, long wait time between requests, and delays in providing your bill.   At the end of the day, I prioritize food before service. It's nice to have both, but sometimes a place will come by with food so good, you'll ignore the fact your waitress just gave spilled water all over you because she practically threw the water pitcher down on the table. Today, that place is Magic Noodles."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle is simply amazing. I love freshly made noodles, but then again who doesn't? These are the words that I live by with food. \"Nothing better than fresh!\" That is basically what these Magic Noodle bowls are filled with. Freshness in every bite, it is almost Magical ;) What makes these noodles so magical and fresh you ask? Its hand pulled in house. You can go right to the back where there will be someone making these noodles right in front of your eyes. Its an art of hand stretching and slamming the dough on the table, and it is quite entertaining to watch.   There is a wide variety of bowls and dishes, but when you visit you need to order a bowl of noodles, specifically freshly hand pulled noodles. If you are not sure what bowl to get, just go for the Traditional LanZhao Beef Noodles. It's my go to bowl of noodles. I have tried the Magic Noodle Signature Beef Soup Noodle, and the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Braised Beef Brisket in Beef Soup. They are all great but if I had to die eating my last bowl of noodles at Magic Noodle, the Traditional LanZhao Beef Noodles would be the way to go. The soup broths are a tad bit salty but the noodles are what you are going there for. What are you waiting for? The magic is waiting... Until next time, JimStar Out!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a bowl of noodles, Magic Noodle can hook you up with some great options. They do hand pulled or knife shaved noodles in a variety of broths or sauces. The last time I was there, we snagged a table in full view of the chef pulling/shaving the noodles, so they are obviously made fresh for your order!  First step is the broth base. My personal preference is the lamb broth, it was light and flavorful without being oily or heavy. If you want something with a bit of kick, the braised beef brisket soup gives an extra bite. You can still taste the beef broth under the spice, so the balance is good.  Noodle choice is next. I like my noodles al dente so the classic noodles was perfect. They stayed chewy and consistent from the first bite to the last. If you like your noodles softer, the knife shaved noodles would be good. Due to the unique shape from the knife shaving through the dough, the noodles start on the chewier side and slowly softens further as it sits in the broth. I did try the curtain noodles, however due to their size, it was unwieldy to eat and I found myself either chewing on noodles alone or drinking soup separately. Probably not the best choice, but an interesting experience.   Prepare to wait at peak weekend hours. It seems easier to snag tables for two people than for larger groups. The space is small and the tables are packed close together. Be prepared to overhear plenty of neighboring conversations, or have your conversations overheard by others."}
{"text":"Pretty great hand stretched noodles. Also has some nice side dishes to go with your noodles. A little squishy inside the restaurant but the service was nice."}
{"text":"I really like Magic Noodle's concept (fresh noodles made right in front of you) but the taste at this place just doesn't make it four stars for me. The place is always super busy (24 hr places typically are) and the restaurant is quite small so it can feel stuffy. But the servers are quick and friendly. And the portions are good, I can never finish a full bowl because there are so many noodles. There's something about their noodles that just seems a little bland for me... but I do like that you can choose your noodle width! From thin and spaghetti-like to thick ribbons and everything in between."}
{"text":"They have the best hand cut noodles and hand pulled noodles in town!!  The tomato & egg noodles is  surprising good~  And of cuz, their beef noodles is very very good!  Waitresses keep saying that it will be a loooong wait for hand cut noodles, and will convict you to order hand pulled noodles, but it's definitely worth the wait! (I personally like hand cut noodles... so~!)  However, I'll recommend you to go with someone who can speak in Mandarin.  I will consider their service as \"standard\", which you can get from other Chinese noodles restaurant.  (Just pay attention on their foods, not their services!)"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The lady serving me was rude, messed up my order and then scoffed at me when I corrected her and told me I was rude. I paid for my drink and left. I will not be giving this company service. It could've been an easy fix but the waitress was having a bad day and took it out on her customers. Unprofessional service."}
{"text":"The noodle is Chinese style (different from ramen). Quite delicious (maybe I am hungry), crowded in the lunch time, you need to pay first and no tip."}
{"text":"One of my favourite noodle shop.  Authentic and fresh!  Vegetarian noodle soup is my #1 choice with a fried egg on top.  Soup is tasty & even better with house made chilli sauce, must try!"}
{"text":"The meat was really fatty but I personally like it and the portion size was big. Service was great, food came quick and hot. The seating was clean and the atmosphere was great for a 2am dine-in spot. Everything was great, if the tentacles were a little hotter when served and there was a little more meat in the noodles along with a little more veggies, it would be 5 stars. I love how they keep chilli sauce at your table for you to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.+ 0.5 star for services and cooperation.  Total 3.5 stars.   Magic Noodle is a good and simple noodle canteen.  The decoration is no frills, with just walls of pictures.  We went for dinner last Saturday.  Since bowl noodle is not known as dinner food, getting a table took no more than 15 minutes wait.  Further parking was a breeze on a non-Tuesday evening (St Louis next door runs dinner deals on Tuesdays).  We ordered a House Special Noodle (large) and a Classic Noodle (small).  I taste-tested and confirmed that they had identical broth.  The broth was clear, flavourful and not overwhelmingly salty.  I could not taste much MSG.  The meat was average.  The portion of the meat was unimpressive.  I could not visually see a noticeable portion difference between the small noodle and the large noodle.  The noodle was the star at Magic Noodle.  It was high quality, as in it was fresh, smooth and chewy.  The noodle itself was one factor that contributes to the chewiness.  My BF was correct that the cook was careful not to overcook the noodle, and the technique contributed to the chewiness as well.  The services was very good.  We told a waitress that we were in a rush when we asked for a table.  She gave us menus to review while we waited.  Hence, we literally placed the orders the minute we were seated.  We were in and out in 45 minutes.  We were quite pleased with the efficiency."}
{"text":"The vegetarian cold noodle is delicious! I love the ingredients they put in the dishes and the pricing is also really good. Giving this place a 4/5 star just because there are limited seating and occasionally the noodles can be a little tough. Otherwise, I am a regular and I love it here."}
{"text":"Great noodle soup place for a good price! The good thing about this place is that its open 24 HOURS. THATS RIGHT. YOU CAN GET BEEF NOODLE SOUP AT 2AM IF YOU WANT TO.   As far as the taste goes, I would recommend getting either the beef noodle soup or the pork belly noodle soup because the broth for those soups surpass all others. The noodles are also freshly made by a Chinese guy in the corner right before they are served. Its only about 8 bucks per bowl and they are pretty filling. Looking forward to coming again."}
{"text":"I tried their Juli Jelly, Lamb Stir fry noodles and beef scrolls. Everything was excellent. The place was packed but we were seated within 5 mins and the food was served very quickly. This was my first time here and I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, tasty, chewy noodles. I had the BBQ pork and duck soup, it had good flavour, the BBQ pork better than the duck. Definitely want to try other dishes for the noodles alone!"}
{"text":"really great hand pulled noodles"}
{"text":"I've passed by here so many times and seen coworkers eat lunch from here but I've never had it myself. We stopped by for Saturday night dinner at around 8 and there were quite a few people waiting. There's not a huge amount of seating. You get a number and you get one of those beeping pager things you get at the Keg or Red Lobster.   Although there were quite a few people we waited for less than ten minutes. I feel like I need to mention the look of the menu cause I quite liked it. Full color, lots of pictures, nice design. They tell you about allergy information with little icons by the name of the item. Magic Noodle has quite the range of choices, some of which are really interesting. The \"Organ Donor\" which has haggis in it caught my eye. But I'm not that adventurous so I went for hand shaved noodles with beef brisket. You can see them shaving and making the noodles fresh in the kitchen.  I was surprised by the hand shaved noodles. I've never had anything like that before - the noodles were really thick with uneven pieces and doughy, but not in a bad way. Don't expect regular noodles or something like ho fun if you get this. They do have regular hand pulled noodles (these are shaved off a piece of dough). The noodles are incredibly filling. The brisket was decent, not the softest I've had and there wasn't a huge amount of it. The soup was a little on the oily side and has a bit of spice to it - perhaps chili oil. If you're the kind of person who can't tolerate even a little bit of spice keep this in mind. Overall not bad. Probably not something I would really crave but I'll likely be back.  Service was cordial, nothing out of the ordinary. This is a good spot if you're looking for a simple meal with a good price point."}
{"text":"I always went to magic noodles before, but this time, I found all the meat and noodles were down to about half of before, I even did not recognize the noodles when the waiter gave that to me. When I ate the chicken, I even found the eggshell, it really sucks."}
{"text":"My first Magic Noodle experience and it couldn't have been a more perfect day for noodles: Cold, snowy and blowing winds. Needless to say we donned our winter gear and trudged our way through the slushy sidewalks for a slurp of the new noodle joint in North York. I love the choose your own noodle adventure, however I went with a house special, Magic Chicken mostly because it was cold and chicken noodle soup warms the soul and I dug the combo pork and chicken broth. It was good, really good! I would have enjoyed some more veg in my bowl as opposed to ALL those noodles (the noodles were fantastic, hand-pulled and all) it's just that for me the portion was more than I could chew. I saw they had a breakfast menu because did I mention they are open 24 hours! I'll come back, but may ask for half the noodles (I hate feeling wasteful!)"}
{"text":"Wonderful hand pulled noodles.  Noodles can be a bit oily depending on which you choose, but still delicious.  Note if you are not a fan of lamb, read the descriptions carefully as many of their dishes contain lamb.  Their staff is not as friendly as Richmond Hill location, but the 24/7 hours are super convenient.  It's also a bit noisy when they are making and slamming the noodles.  A glass window like some places would have been nice.  This location can be pretty busy during peak hours and weekends, so be prepared to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"The hand pulled noodle with beef brisket soup was way too salty ( I wonder how some would say it's flavorful, hmm). We ordered the pork burger.We have to remind the server about it after waiting until we were almost done with our soup. Somehow I believed she had forgotten to order it. When the server decided it was time to serve the burger, we ended up not having it as it had been sitting on the counter.  It was a waste of time coming here, there was definitely no Magic here."}
{"text":"This is the Chinese version of ramen, but called lamian in mandarin. I think both means pull noodle in there own language. Ramen derived from lamian long time ago, so maybe that's why they sound and mean the same.   I ate here a lot of times, mainly because it's convenient, tasty, and not too pricey. Service is typical Chinese restaurant, takes the order puts the food on your table, nothing much more. It's always busy but much easier to get a seat compared to the Scarborough location. It's noisy, and not very good for big groups so make sure to take that into consideration if you want to have a comfortable place to talk.   Compared to Japanese ramen, the soup is kind of bland. Chinese Lamian emphasize much more on the texture of the noodle itself rather than the soup. So the noodle is chewy and springy, which is a good thing. At least I like it like that. The toppings are adequate and compliments the noodle well.  Overall, it's a nice place to grab a quick lunch, but nothing fancy or extraordinary.  Taste *** Price *** Portion ***"}
{"text":"VERY disappointing.  thin broth, meh noodles.  Lacklustre service. wont go back.  but maybe this is what one should expect given the Harbod location."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is open 24 hours! So key. To be honest, I didn't have high expectations coming here at 12am on a random Saturday night. Most 24 hour restaurants lack in taste but exceed in convenience. This place hit both. I got one of the beef noodles and it was pretty good..like I'd come here on a normal day for a bowl of beef noodles! Was very pleasantly surprised. The service was also better than expected for a cheap Chinese restaurant. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon the place is absolutely packed to the rim. The lineup looked like it would take at least 30 minutes to clear up but we were seated in about 10 minutes. Even though they were so busy I consider the service to be acceptable. All the workers were running around and working so hard. I could see the exhaustion in their faces.   I would disregard the review from Andrew F. - Opening and closing times are posted for a reason so if you are still eating when the place is going to close within 5 minutes then its really your own fault. Even though Campbell's does make some good canned soups, I think the only way I would be eating Campbell's soup is if zombies took over the Earth and the only form of food left over was canned.   Went off topic there but anyways, as for the food....  Ordered the beef pancake wrap $5.99 - The wrap tasted very good but you can tell it was very rushed when put together. The tin foil was heated up with the actual pancake and when they sliced the pancake wrap it created small pieces of foil within. So beware - you could accidentally eat some foil.  House special (large) $7.99 - this dish comes with an assortment of meat which I believe comes with sliced beef, tripe, lamb and pork chop. There is also a fried egg and some pickled sweet and sour radish. The soup was pretty good and the noodles were spot on. A nice chew to them with great texture. I wish they had an extra large on the menu as I found myself wanting more. Luckily my sister couldn't finish her bowl :) More for me."}
{"text":"I just  love the noodles here. I tried both the hand cut noodles and the traditional hand pulled noodles. Both were amazing but I still prefer the hand pulled noodles. The texture of the noodles were perfect and it was cooked perfectly aswell. Not too soggy with a good bounce to it. As for the meat I tried both the beef ribs and beef tenderloin and  I found the meat to be a bit tough and chewy.  We also had the house special beef pancake $3.99. I hint of sweetness in the sauce and tasted pretty decent.   From the outside the place looks to be pretty large but once you get in you realize its much smaller than it looks. The service was very fast. Workers speak mandarin we used half Cantonese and English to communicate and there were no problems.   The awesomeness of the noodles gives this place an extra 0.5 stars   3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Can't believe I never tried this place since I lived in the neighborhood for several years. It was packed when we arrived but didn't have to wait too long since we were only a party of 2 (10mins max). A lot of noodle variety and soup bases. Can specify your preferred thickness. They have hand cut noodle too. A good variety of side dishes. We ordered the intestines one and enjoyed it (still prefer the deep fried ones from hk tho). Noodles are made on site, open style kitchen. My husband enjoyed his hand cut noodle and i got the regular noodle and thought it was okay. Beware when ordering hand cut noodles, it may take longer until yours come since they said they need to finish making the other ramens first...at least that was our understanding of it. Pictures may not resemble your actual noodle (as mentioned by some other reviewers). Open 24hrs. They take cash or debit only (I believe debit only allowed over a certain amount). Overall, I  would come back again for the noodles, especially on those late nights."}
{"text":"I love that they have so many options of thickness of their noodles. ? is like Udon and ? is thicker and more flat. The portion is more than enough and the taste was excellent. They've got a lot to choose from.   Beware though, if you order the thick flat noodle (the biggest one) it's super thick, long and chewy."}
{"text":"Coming into a neighborhood where the noodle competition is extremely cut-throat, Magic noodles has proved that they are a strong contender and looking for here to stay.   When you come in, you are asked to wait in line to place your order. There isn't a lot of seating available since its recent opening has stirred quite alot of people to come visit. Getting the chopsticks, condiments and napkins need to be done by yourself.   The noodles overall has a wonderful texture and I enjoy how they are nice and chewy and not overcooked. The soup isnt the most strongest or anything special but it does the job.   Overall price of each bowl is $9 + tax and the portions are reasonable compared to some joints that I've been to. The beef bowl comes with enough slices of meat and the quality is alright.   I noticed that you can order online here: http://www.order-magicnoodle.ca/foodticket/ (I havent tried to see if it works but this location is up here) and maybe next time I'll try the takeout and eat at home since it is more convenient.  Keep it up Magic Noodles!"}
{"text":"Magic nooooodle! This place is right near my workplace and wow. Definitely going to come here more often! Came here about 12:40 and it's super packed.  Recommend going in twos to get fast seating! The service wasn't anything special just a quick seating and order. The food seemed a decent price for what you get.   I ordered the house special and yum that was very good! Hand pulled noodles all day! Definitely taste the chewiness in them! The soup and rest of ingredients were so tasty and soft!   The area isn't that big so be careful on Tuesday nights since it shares parking with St Louis!"}
{"text":"Not a good restaurant. Noodles taste like cheap ramen and soup is very salty probably has a lot of msg. Not authentic at all."}
{"text":"Ordered the 'BBQ Buddies' soup with the ribbon noodles. Food was excellent.  There was a guy making noodles - fresh. He WAS hand pulling them like the ads say. I actually saw him roll-out and cut the noodles that became MY meal. Doesn't get fresher than that! I read some other reviews about bad service but I think this is due to a language barrier. Personally, the food was amazing and I'll return. I've travelled around the world and have no problem pointing and speaking in broken English to order excellent food. Haha Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for Markham people when you're looking for a late night bite. The number one perk about this place is that it's open 24 hours!   The customer service is here is super mediocre. Especially if you are coming late at night, don't expect a warm greeting or anything. The wait can get pretty long too, especially if you're coming from an event.    The noodles here are freshly made which is really good but the meat and soup base are alright. There's a chef in the kitchen that makes it in front of you!   Overall the food makes me feel disgusting afterwards because of all the oil and every time I come here I have to wait. It's alright but it's definitely not my first choice for restaurant."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  If this restaurant wasn't called Magic Noodle, I would've given this place 4 stars. If it was called something in reference to the various snacks they have, it would have been an easy 4 stars, cause honestly I enjoyed the snacks more than the noodles themselves.  This restaurant is 24 hours, which is quite shocking considering there's no wifi...and the place wasn't insanely busy when I left at around 9:30pm. It also doesn't immediately ring \"24 hours\" considering the not-so bar-like atmosphere (no alcohol!).  We had both kinds of noodles, and also ordered the beef pancake, beef skewers, and squid skewers (whole and tentacle). My parents preferred the hand pulled noodle over the sliced noodle, however I preferred the sliced noodle a bit more...personal preference I guess. However I really didn't find the hand pulled noodle that good, cause it was too...soggy. The seafood that came with it felt like it came from the packages you get at T&T, not to mention the imitation crab was undercooked.  The skewers, on the other hand, were excellent!!! I loved the sauce that came with both the squid skewers. The beef skewers were also just as good, and quite honestly I would rather have these skewers anytime over waiting in line at Night It Up, which happened on the same weekend I tried this place.  Service was excellent and we were attended to the entire time we were there. Even the chef who was making the noodles said thank you when we were leaving, so we left him a tip as we left. Overall I would come here for the skewers and snacks, not so much the noodles."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle is now (somewhat) closer to my home, and there's actually space in this branch! Actually it's just as busy as the Scarborough branch, but I managed to grab the last table on a Sunday night at 8pm before a large line formed.  One thing I like about this place is you can come here even if you're hungry or relatively full. If you're hungry, order the noodles. If you're full, order snacks or skewers! My party of 3 decided to order both noodles and snacks/skewers.  We started with a hand-pulled noodle with beef. A note that people should know: The picture shown is only possible if you add the spicy sauce; the broth actually comes plain, so if you're not tolerant of spicy foods, there's no problem with ordering any of the noodles. Either way, the broth wasn't anything special, but I really like the springy-ness of the noodles!   In the sizzling menu, we ordered the sizzling fresh squid, fresh squid tentacles, fresh squid head, tofu, and lamb kebab. The squid and squid head were excellent; the tentacles I would probably skip next time as they weren't anything special. The tofu is a must: the outside texture is very sweet and unique! Finally, the lamb kebab is their specialty, and there's a reason why: extremely juicy, not too tough but quite chewy, and the spices they add are overall delicious! Not too spicy as well!  Service wasn't too great, as they missed some of our orders at the initial round. They also seem to be understaffed and overwhelmed by the huge demand for this place. Hopefully things will be better once everything is more settled.  Nonetheless...I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed during lunch or dinner or night snack hours... When there is a line, you have to get the pager from them first.  Overall this place tasted great from other chinese noodle shops. However, I think they put a lot of MSG and salt to make the soup based to taste this good. The price was alright, and they have a choice of small or large bowl. I always ordered their small bowl which I think its enough already.   Stay away from the noodle soups that have the actual pork bones in it. There is so little meat on the bones, so basically you are like a dog, smelling and chewing bones the whole night :D  The small cold plate of veg was about $4. I think I will order something else instead...."}
{"text":"Pretty decent noodle spot! The noodles are all made in house and if you get a good table you can watch them being hand stretched.  We went on a Saturday at lunch and the place was packed. I had the beef brisket noodle soup and my wife had the house special. Both were flavorful and jammed full of fresh noodles. My brisket was not as lean as I would have liked and i spent a little bit of time \"trimming the fat\" from the meat. Personal preference but I thought I should mention it.  Service was what you would expect: adequate, not great. We had to wait a while to put our order in but once the food was ready it came to us quickly.  Iif you've never had fresh made noodles before definitely give it a try. They are more substantial than factory made noodles, and pleasantly chewy too.   Note that this is a Chinese noodle restaurant, so you won't get soba or ramen here."}
{"text":"Magic noodle is a hit or miss. Depending on the noodle puller. Open 24 hours; they serve to satisfy my cravings for some soupy noodle goodness during the twilight hours.   Acceptable Serving sizes and consistent flavour on the grilled foods. Expect to wait for seats. Large and abundant parking.   Will return at the wee hours of the night after a couple beers and drinks."}
{"text":"The noodles at Magic Noodle were great! The noodle had a chewy texture and the soup didn't make me too thirsty. I like how the chef makes the noodle in house at the end of the store. However, the skewers weren't as good as the Japanese skewers. Also, the place is a bit small so I would recommend going earlier to avoid line ups. I would definitely come back to Magic Noodle and recommend it to friends. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Magic Noodle's noodles were pretty magical. I went with 3 other friends on Wednesday night and had a really great time.   It was a delight to watch the different noodles pulled right in front of us, freshly made for each order. The noodles were cooked to the perfect level of chewiness. We ordered the popcorn chicken and skinny beef to share then each ordered a noodle dish: Magic Beef with curtain noodles, The Magic with classic noodles, Triple B with classic noodles, and Magic Friar with the mid triad noodles. The first three were soup noodles and the last was a plate of fried noodles. The soup base was very light for the first two, if you want something more hearty, I would recommend the Triple B with the richer soup base. The Magic Friar is a must try. It was the first time I've had fried freshly made noodles and it completely raised the bar on fried noodles for me. The toppings were very normal but the noodles are so good that it more than makes up for it. The bill came out to be a very reasonable $14 per person after taxes and tips.  We stayed there for a long time just talking after we paid; the servers never rushed us and continued to bring us water refills until we were ready to leave. I will definitely return again for more of the fried noodles very soon!"}
{"text":"I was quite excited to try this place out given I am a big fan of handmade noodles. Noodles here are delicious and I like how they give you the choice of different thicknesses. However, I did find that other than the noodles, they are stingy on the meat, etc that comes with the noodles. Overall, dishes were good but for the price I am paying, they are not delivering much.  It is also very busy here all the time which means long wait times. Service was not great."}
{"text":"3.5/5. I've been to the Magic Noodle uptown in Markham and wasn't the biggest fan. However, was pleasantly surprised by this location. There appears to be a larger menu and as the location appears to be less busy, food is prepared better in my opinion. It was my first time trying the curtain noodles and I found them to be just the right amount of chewy. You can never go wrong with soup noodles so it's nice that there is a variety of noodle thicknesses to try. We decided to opt for a bunch of side dishes as well. Just like the Markham location, the lamb skewers were deliciously seasoned with cumin and at times, a bit too spicy! My favourite would have to be the popcorn chicken. It came piping hot, meat was juicy and the breading had a perfect amount of crispiness! As for the skinny cow, I found the scalilions gave it a nice touch. The most disappointing parts about the meal however was the pork gamo which had a stingy amount of stuffing and the bao itself was dry. Another complaint I had was the fact that the waitress would not seat us at the booths eventhough we order quite a few dishes and the shop wasn't too busy. Overall, service was mediocre but food made up for it."}
{"text":"Amazing display of making the classic noodles.  A packed house at lunch.   Came back to try a different dish.   Tofu was amazing.  The wonton are small and you don't get a lot of meat.   The vegetables soup was really good. Was the best choice on this visit.   Service is ok, pricing is not bad, cash or debit only.   For soup I would say this place is average. But the noodles are spectacular and make it worth the trip.   Next time I'll try a stir fry dish."}
{"text":"I've been eating at magic noodle since they opened their first location in Scarborough. The owner has come a long way from the days of flipping flour dough all by himself from 11am to 11pm. His tenacity and grit is something I truly admire.  Over the years the food quality has lose a bit of its authenticity and taste due to mass production, but they make up for it with streamline service and convenience with 24 HR service and app ordering. Overall it still tastes great and it satisfies your soupy food cravings more than enough."}
{"text":"I sometimes go here for breakfast, but I have to say the food is average, noodle tastes a bit salty and it makes you wanna drink tons of water after eating it. Btw, they give you lousy service.   I've never received such a bad service like this. They made a mistake about my order, never said sorry, really rude. Save your money, don't come here."}
{"text":"As restaurant folk, my boyfriend and I don't get back into the city until around 12 AM, so this is one of the few places we can go out to eat together after work.  The mood and atmosphere is nothing to write home about. It's literally just a large room with booths. And a constant awkward slapping noise (The guy making the noodles).  The service has absolutely no personality. I feel like I want to hand my waitress some batteries sometimes. They can come off as rude, uninviting and judgmental. At least the females anyway.  The saving grace really is the fresh hand pulled noodles. I also really enjoy the sweet potato hearts."}
{"text":"2.5  Pros: Build your own noodle available  Cons: Broth is way too salty  If you live in the Yonge and Finch/Sheppard area, you'll know that noodle places all popping up like crazy here.  Magic Noodle is one the latest of such places to appear here.  I've been to the one in Scarborough in the past, so I decided to try this place out here.    Magic noodle specializes in hand pulled soup noodles.  They have some stir fry ones as well, but you will be coming here for soup noodles most of the time.  This review will only focus on take out as I've only done that the 2 times I've been here.    Magic noodle has a set of noodles to choose from the menu.  If you're me, you'll like the fact that you can build your own noodle.  When building your own noodle, you choose the type of noodle, broth, protein and vegetables.  There's a lot of choice here and the combinations you can make here are almost infinite.    As with every Chinese restaurant I go to the first time, I always order in English.  For the most part, the server's English was good enough. They are however, much more helpful in Chinese.  It's not because they prefer Chinese, it's just the language they're more comfortable speaking in.  Still, if you only speak English, you will still do fine here.  All the menus have English as well.  On to the food.  The noodles here are all hand pulled and made to order.  I've had the Triple B and the Magic Lamb as well as 2 create your own noodles.  The noodles have good bite as expected from hand pulled noodles.  The proteins and vegetables are not bad though I wished they would give you more portion wise.  The main negative here is the broth.  Broth is for me the 2nd most important part of soup noodles (and for some the 1st).  It's way too salty here.  It's so salty it makes you think it's full of msg.  I was so thirsty each time after having a bowl of noodles here.  This place would easily be a go to for me if not for the broth.     Magic noodle is decent, but in my opinion could be better.  Big beef bowl is my go to in the area for hand pulled noodles.  Magic noodle is still worth a try though."}
{"text":"I came here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner - and I had to line up for both times even though it wasn't during peak lunch (1:30 pm)/dinner (6:30 pm) time.  The first time I came here was for dinner and I ordered hand pulled noodle with beef offal ($7.99), sizzling tofu skewer ($1.50) and sizzling fresh squid tentacles ($1.99). I thought that the prices were fairly marked. The small bowl of hand pulled noodle was very filling - I could barely finish it. The offal were very tender and the noodle was a good chewy consistency. The tofu was on the spicy side but flavourful. The squid tentacle was mediocre. The sauce that it came with was like hoisin sauce but tastewise, it wasn't anything special.  The second time I visited this restaurant, I ordered more snacks and shared a small bowl of noodle with my mom. We got the beef wrap ($5.99) which my mom loved since there was no onion in it. I thought that it tasted great too (although I wish that onion was included). We got a chive pancake ($2.99) which was quite tasty. However, price wise, it's more expensive than my usual new Northern Dumplings restaurant. Taste wise, they're completely different but one isn't better than the other. I got a lamb skewer ($1.99) and it's the best lamb skewer I've ever had. It was tender, juicy, not too salty and not spicy at all. It was perfect. The last snack we got was sweet potato patty ($0.80) and I didn't like it at all because it wasn't sweet (it wasn't supposed to be sweet but I didn't know that).  I'm glad this restaurant is near my area because I quite enjoyed the food here and I'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I liked this place before but now I think I'll never go back again. Although I can speak mandarin, I still feel that it's impossible to communicate with waiters. They didn't really care how long I have been waiting for water, my order, even my bill at all at AMOST EvERYTIME I went there. They are always look busy but always ignore me, and I found I'm not the only one being treated like that. It's the new menu make me decide to never go back again. There are only a few choices left on the menu. It's very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 5 or 6 times just this month alone so needless to say I'm a huge fan of this place. Surprisingly I've never had bad service at this place like my fellow yelpers, maybe I'm lucky? Sometimes the server would even flash me a smile. But when it gets busy it does take a bit of effort to flag one of the servers. Besides that I don't have any complaints with the service.   The noodles are yummy! Freshly pulled in front of my eyes, cooked to perfection with the perfect bite. I never realized before but fresh noodles has a yummy subtle flavor that dried noodles just lack. My favorite has got to be the braised brisket pulled noodles. Good amount of spice in the soup base and the meat is tender. I also love their grilled tofu, a little spicy that's balanced with hoisin sauce. Their cold veggies dishes are pretty good. They have a glass fridge near the front where you can see what cold dishes are available that day.   Their plain broth can be bland but if you are eating the grilled tofu I think it's the perfect combination.   Overall I do recommend this place for those that enjoys a good bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"This location opened within the last year right near my house, serving freshly made noodles and mainland Chinese food.  The menu offers a large selection of appetizers, dry noodles, soup noodles, etc.. they are all delicious and reasonably priced...but the clientele at this restaurant brings the entire atmosphere down.  When we got in around 7pm, it was very busy and there were about 3 parties ahead of us..not much standing space at the entrance. As we stood there for about 15 minutes, the next table available was to be ours. As the table left, a Chinese lady waiting behind us for a table suddenly jumped to the table, food court style and claimed it as hers, ridiculous.  The staff there did not even notice this (they were quite busy) until we brought it up and had the waitress approach the lady.  I would come here again maybe during slower times but definitely would not wait in line to eat here."}
{"text":"This has slowly became my go-to place for noodles, especially for after hours. They are 24hrs, cash and debit only.  The noodles are really tasty and not too oily (unlike some of the other Chinese noodle places I've tried!) my favourite one is the magic lamb noodle that's on their second (?) page of their menu. They also have lamb skewers (not as good as other Chinese BBQ places I've been to, but not bad either since it is 24hrs and it does specialize in noodles after all, it's something I'd still order there if I wanted lamb skewers).  Fast service!!! ***"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and has the braised pork bone noodle soup and beef rib soup. The broth is a bit too salty for the braised pork noodle soup and they don't put enough meat regardless of what dish you order. I felt shortchanged considering the price. However I come because the noodles are delicious!"}
{"text":"The handmade noodles are pretty good, though if you have it once you'll know it tastes like Man Tou (plain white Chinese bun). Unfortunately that's as interesting as it gets. The pork belly I got was incredibly dry even in the broth which is pretty much just msg and water. The pork scrolls were so oily I had to use several pieces of tissue to soak it up. They are open 24 hours a day, so that's one of the redeeming points, but the food is honestly mediocre at best. The portions are good for the pricing though, but the taste just isn't there."}
{"text":"A 24 hour joint located in a sea of late night eats along the strip of Midland Avenue in Scarborough.  Generally busy all the time even at 2am in the morning!  The main draw for people are the hand pulled and sliced noodle soups.  They also serve some Chinese BBQ such as lamb and beef skewers, and other northern and western Chinese specialties.  You can see the noodle chef making the noodles behind the glass window to the kitchen.  When they first opened up I would have given them a 5 star but went recently and it's definitely not as good as before.  Maybe I'm getting old and both my taste buds and memory are fading but the broths are no longer as rich and flavourful as once were and the noodles are no longer as chewy and delicious as I once remember it was.  My broth was kinda bland and noodles were overcooked to be honest the last time around.  Prices of most noodle soups are under $10 and appetizers under $5 so it's still definitely a great value.  Most of the servers generally only speak Mandarin so it's a good place to brush up on your dialect when you order:)  The place is a little small though so it gets pretty cramped when crowded as the tables are really packed in tight.  Food generally comes out quickly and service is generally pretty good.  Overall it's still good but like seeing your first love after 20 years apart, he/she are not like what you remember:)"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, everyone I go. It's also 24/7 which is awesome!!!  First time, I came here, we obviously ordered soup noodles which was really good.  We also ordered a whole bunch of side orders. The bill was $80 for 3 people - we ordered a lot of side dishes lol, but my friends were from out of town and then wanted to try everything..  The noodles were awesome, 5 stars.  Side dishes were no so great.. 2 stars.  Went back again twice with different family members, noodles again were 5 stars. Ordered different side dishes from last time.. Still 2 stars for side dishes lol,  Went back again for lunch, just had noodles, 5 stars!!  I think you get the picture.."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounding down to a 3  Same deal as their midland and McNicole location which I gave a 3.5 rounded up to a 4.  The noodles here are legit good.  The 3 of us had a Magic Lamb, Magic Beef, and Magic Chicken. $8.99 each.  The Lamb is mutton with bone.. needed more time braising.. 2 stars on the lamb, 4.5 stars on the noodles.  The Beef is more of a tendon braised and then sliced. 3 stars on the beef.  The chicken was Pan-fried dark meat. Not bad.. portion was good.  The Kalbi (short-ribs) were not tender at all.. its deep fried. Lacked seasoning and flavour. 2 stars   The nom nom chicken was 1.5 stars.. not authentic at all.. pretty bad tasting.  Overall, I would recommend the noodles here, the soup base was different for each noodle we ordered, but it was full of MSG.. expected more..  If we're to come back here, it was be a Magic Noodle and then pay extra $1 for extra noodles.. no need to try any of their appetizers.."}
{"text":"Great noodles, good vibe. Open 24/7  The magic is $10 and a huge portion. My new 24hr spot."}
{"text":"Subpar service, good food.  There was far better consistency in noodle size with the hand-pulled noodles than the sliced noodles. The staff make quite a show working the hand-pulled noodles. Sit too close to the counter and you'll be startled every few moments. Unfortunately, the meat content in the dish is too low... and the presentation of their dishes resemble..... will there's no resemblance to anything since I don't think any thought was put into it.  Staff will speak to you in whatever language they feel like at the time. I'll talk to them when I enter in Cantonese and be seated in 30 seconds in Mandarin. They're also extremely hard to get a hold of... tried to get someone to bring the bill, which was impossible until they decided to bring it to us because there were people waiting outside the door.  No credit cards.   I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"The place is really nice and the service is real quick but the food is not THAT great  I made my own ramen with vegetal broth and tofu, and both of them lacked on taste :/"}
{"text":"Came here because I've been to the uptown locations and this location is very near UofT.   I got the traditional beef noodles (magic beef noodle? I forgot the name) ($8.99) which was just average. I don't know if they actually make the beef broth in-house because it really doesn't have anything special or \"magical\" about it. I also ordered their seaweed salad ($3.75) which came instantly (so it's definitely pre-made then refrigerated). It was flavourless so I wouldn't recommend that.   Service was okay, they have free wifi (pw: their phone number), clean restaurant, total came to about $12.50 per person.  Wouldn't come here again unless I'm desperate for noodles and didn't want to mission to Chinatown for better Lan Zhou noodles."}
{"text":"*The quality has gone down over the years, but the food is decent consider the price that I paid for.  *The good thing about Magic Noodle is that you know for sure you are getting fresh homemade noodles.The chefs are constantly pulling and stretching (occasionally slamming) the noodles right in front of your eyes.  -House Special Magic Noodle - $7.99 Small:  this looked nothing like the picture on the menu LOL.On the menu the broth seemed to be red and there were more varieties of vegetables, so expect that the pictures might not resemble your actual dishes.  The texture of the noodle was spot on, slightly chewy, soft but not too soggy. The soup base was packed full of flavour, quite refreshing and not too salty at all. The pork was good, I just wished the pan-fried egg had a more gooey yolk and some kind of green vegetables would have been nice as well.  -Hand-Pulled Noodle with Pork Bone - $7.99 Large:  Friend said there was nothing special and complained that there was barely any meat. The broth was not oily and again, very flavourful. I say skip this dish and get other type of meats with the hand-pulled noodles :).  -House Special Pork Burger - $3.99:  Albeit it's a little bit oily, but I would order this again and I definitely recommend it! The pastry was crunchy, and it had a hint of nuttiness from the sesame seeds. The pork was a bit salty, soft and had a layer of fat running through. Together with the sesame pastry, it was a wonderful combination....   -Goubuli Chinese Bun (Pork & Leek) - $0.99 If you don't feel like having a bowl of noodle, lucky you there are other snacks or side dishes as well, and they are all cheap! The bun had a good filling to bun ratio and it was very \"supple,\" and had the right amount of elasticity to it. Furthermore, the filling was hearty and seasoned just right, the braising liquid was just enough to soak the bun without making it become soggy."}
{"text":"If you are here for a late night then it's a good option to eat out. Aside from your regular all-canadian food places. Good with budget and has a lot of food options as well."}
{"text":"I love the place.  I'm a noodles fan and this servers great hand noodles with so many selections.  The space is small and may end up lining up."}
{"text":"I went to Magic Noodle tonight and was kind of disappointed.   I ordered the Magic Beef and popcorn chicken as a side. The Magic Beef ($8.50) was a great portion size. I wouldn't say that there was \"a lot\" of meat, but I do think there was an adequate amount for the price you are paying. As for the flavour --- the noodles were absolutely amazing. The were so chewy and you can tell that they were fresh. Unfortunately, the broth was a huge letdown. The broth had a bit of a strange flavour to it. They used a spice/seasoning that I can't put my finger on, but I can go as far as saying that it tasted out of place. Flavourful, yes, but I personally did not find it tasty.   The popcorn chicken was also a disappointment. The flavour was great, the chicken was tender, and the dipping sauce was also tasty. Unfortunately, the portion size was really small considering they charged $5 for for it.   Overall, I may consider coming back here and trying a different noodle bowl, only because the noodles were so great!"}
{"text":"Very authentic noodles and Chinese appetizers (lamb skewers, pig ears, etc) at a very reasonable price. Place isnt the cleanest and there is usually a line up. Best thing however is that they open 24h."}
{"text":"Great location - right on a busy street and open 24/7. That's a plus considering we just landed at the airport at 11:30pm and needed comfort food.   We've tried this place before and can't remember if we loved it or not. So we've decided to try it again, but this time take out.   My husband got their specialty, beef noodle soup and I got a side order of Tofoodles (Tofu Noodles). The noodles was great because of the pulled noodle part, soft and chewy is what makes it delicious. Tofoodles was definitely bland. Total of $15.80 after tax.   Overall it wasn't bad but wouldn't come here so often. It's a good back up option for 24/7 noodle soup place. But there's nothing special or unique about their food.  Note: this place only accepts debit or cash"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. Had the eggplant dried noodle, and it was just one slimy horrendous mess. Took few bites and almost threw up. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I got the Magic Lamb, The soup base is a bit sweat, which is quite unusual. The quality of goji berries in the soup is not good- Extremely red, which means they are dyed. I prefer the LanZhou pulled noodles at Spadina."}
{"text":"My partner has been trying to bring me here for so long so I finally decided to on a day I was feeling a bit under the weather. He ordered a few different items and then we sat down to wait. The Infinity Edge drink was light and refreshing, the Magic was very hearty, and the Triple B was flavourful! Definitely very filling and satisfying on a cold day. As for the sides, the Popcorn Chicken and Magic Scrolls were also tasty. Would love to come back to try the stir fried noodles!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a midnight meal if my friends and I ever stay out late at night. The food here is great, but I often find that their soups do not have enough meat in comparison to the amount of noodles they give. Thats why I often order myself lamb skewers in order to compensate. Overall great restaurant, and I will always be back."}
{"text":"Meh.  Was hoping for a little more, but it was meh.  The soup needed to be spiced with more care - it was pretty bland.  The noodles were well pulled but my curtain noodles needed to boil about .30 seconds longer.  Prepared salads:  don't.  The taofu pi was stuck together like glue - definitely not made the same day ...  THe lamb skewer - meh.  Asked for it to be mah-lah (very hot) and it was barely a tickle on my tongue.  Adequate.  What this place is lacking is a little soul and authenticity ..."}
{"text":"The fired noodle is on the very salty side. The original beef noodle is mediocre and I don't think they use the true beef stock soup base.  Don't bother with their breakfast as it looks like left over meat from the previous day heated on demand...the one I got was still cold...the only redeeming quality is that it opens 24hrs"}
{"text":"Great place for noodle soup if you're trying something else other than pho. The broth was very delicious (they added very little salt!, which was a plus on my end). They have different types of noodles from wide to thin hand pulled noodles. They also have plenty of apps which was also worth your money! I recommend the pork and beef jiambo (very filling) other apps also seemed delicious and SPICY!   If you want something else other than pho, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Did not have such a \"magical\" experience and I will explain why. I ordered the curtain noodles with pork (see image). The soul broth was completely opaque and dark because the cooks ONLY put a large amount of soy sauce inside the bowl - no water, no dilution of the extremely salty taste. It was so horribly disgusting that I had to send it back. When I got the dish back, all the chefs did was remove the soy sauce and added a lot of water. The dish turned from super salty to completely bland. On top of that, the pork pieces were so small which makes it inefficient and unenjoyable to eat the dish since you will be spending 80% of your time picking at the pork.  I left the rating as 2/5 because I have had a decent experience a couple of months ago.   If you're looking for a better noodle place with better attention to detail to their food (seriously, who drenches a noodle soup with only 250mL of soy sauce?) try something else.   WILL NOT GO AGAIN"}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this place? I went with a friend, eagerly hungry and ready to consume copious amount of authentic hand pulled noodles. We were seated promptly and we looked around. Aesthetically, the place looks like a can of sardines, you are seated so close to your neighbor that you are forced to listen to their conversations. The waitress brought our menus and we spent some time looking at different types of noodles.   During this time, the waitress brought a jug of water and we drank from it to quench our thirst....   I have never been so turned off by water so quickly, drinking this water felt like torture. I felt like I was being waterboarded. Water is such an quintessential part of our survival, it is so simple; and yet with this simplicity in mind, a restaurant to screw up on water is like a fish not being able to swim. First, the water container was stained. When I mean stained, I mean stained like an inner glass of a dirty aquarium, where they just refused to clean the place. I could literally swipe my finger across the inside of the jug and my finger would come out chalky.   Additionally, water from this jug tasted like swimming pool water. Just imagine yourself swimming at a public pool; you dive into the deep end to to see how long you can hold your breath. You miscalculate, panic, and haphazardly chug a mouthful of water when coming back up. That's how drinking this water felt/tasted like: a glass of water from a crowded swimming pool, slow cooked at a ripe temperature of 35c. In attempt to hail mary this devastating jug of liquid they called water, they put an ample amount of lemon to mask the pungent taste of chlorine, sweat and swimwear. Despite this lemon-nuke, I vividly remember tasting the floor of my local swimming pool.  Their hand pulled noodle was good, texture was chewy and soft. No complains on the noodles. However, the soup itself was displeasing. I could easily condense the soup into two parts: MSG and Water.   Price is fair. I mean for someone to pull your noodles and serve it in a bathtub of MSG water, $11 - $15 is easily justifiable.  Everything else was OK.  1/5"}
{"text":"Freshly made noodles in the back of the restaurant! Really good quality food, however just a bit to oily for me, It may just be the lamb dish I ordered. Will definitely be back to try the beef noodles."}
{"text":"This location is open 24-hours so we came here for a late night snack after a bit of drinking! Around 2 am, we had to wait 10 minutes for a spot for 10 people and boy was it packed. It was packed and there was always a line for a table from when we got there to when we left.  The prices are pretty good - usually $7 - 8 for small and around $9 for a large. I got the magic noodle which comes with beef, chicken and lamb. The noodles were MAGICAL, they were really really good and I haven't had noodles like that before. It tasted fresh and authentic, and was probably the best part of the meal. Unfortunately, there was barely any meat in my meal, it was actually pretty sad how little meat there was, a tiny piece of chicken, with little strips of beef that were the size of a macaroni and like 2 pieces of lamb that were very small, probably the size of a USB, so that was fairly disappointing.  I believe it is because it's late and the chefs put no effort, so that's unfortunate because the noodles are really good. I believe if I come during the day the meals will be more reasonable and better, so I'm excited to come back during the day to try this place out. Then, I'll update my review if it's actually better."}
{"text":"Live in the area, tried this place today.  Never been to a Magic Noodle before, apparently there is a few of them.  Being a first timer and looking at the menu in the restaurant I had to ask what a lot of things were.  Like a menu item would be called Triple B, well what's a Triple B?  What's a Spiced Up Marriage and how do they know I need that?  Unless you know how to read Chinese you have no idea what 1/3 of the items are.  Then I noticed they had the full description in the take out menu.    Good points is its 24 hours, its also on the authentic side and has not totally Thai Express-ed.  It's like an eat and go place so no tip but they also give you proper bowls and utensils to eat with.  Service was friendly and the noodles are made onsite which you know then is fresh.  You can also choose the type and thickness of the noodles.  Bad points, We ordered the Magic Lamb, Magic Beef and the Spiced Up Marriage.  The bowls were of decent size but the meat was almost non existent.  I had about 4 decent chunks of lamb, and within a chunk, part of it was bone.  The Magic Beef dish also hardly had any meat. The noodles were good.  Broth for the Magic Lamb did not taste like lamb broth though.  I got it spicy which was good and not overly spicy.  Overall not enough protein in the main course to keep me coming back.  Just be aware that the pictures posted on Yelp as of the time of this review is posted by the company and not by customers.  The food does not look like that.  After the meal, marriage is still bland."}
{"text":"I came to Magic Noodle a couple of times, and I enjoyed the food very much :) Yes, magical indeed lol. Both times this place was busy but wait time wasn't too bad, maybe 5 minutes tops. Their traditional hand-pulled noodles and hand-sliced noodles are definitely a delicious and inexpensive alternative compared to the overrated and costly ramen noodles in downtown Toronto.  Clueless of what to order, we looked around curiously to see what our neighbors have ordered... they seem to know what they are doing lol.  1. Handmade noodles (seems like a no brainer lol) - many combinations, all cooked al dente... love the chewiness :) The broth was a little on lighter side but I love drinking the soup while eating my noodles, so it is perfect that the flavour is not too salty or overpowering. 2. Pan fried pancake stuffed with chives and leeks - so hearty with lots of stuffings and the outside was crispy. I ordered this both times because everyone else did too lol. 3. Seriously GO for the skewers! I've tried the sizzling tofu, squid, and lamb... really delicious! You order by the skewer. Their house made marinating sauce tasted amazing. It was sweet with a bit of a kick. Btw, the lamb was the only one sprinkled with super spicy herb... and I was breathing fire after lol (I can't eat TOO spicy!) but my friends all loved it XD 4. Pan fried pancake with red bean paste -  perfect way to end your meal :) It was not too sweet. But be sure to share this one because it can be quite filling!  So, come here if you are craving for noodles or if you just want a quick bite! The food is great, the service is fast, and you will even get a live show when you order their hand-pulled or hand-sliced noodles! Be sure to tip the chefs at the station for their hard work - there is a tip box in front of their work station :) Happy noodle eating!"}
{"text":"It was a MAGICAL moment when I drove by Harbord and randomly discovered this new location :D  I'm so in love with the 24 hour one uptown... I can't stop raving about it to my friends :D  But the BAD news is that the downtown location isn't as magical :( The Pot Belly with hand-shaved noodles was quite disappointing. The braised pork belly was a bit tough and the noodles, zomg, where do I even start?  Inconsistent thickness... some thick and some were paper thin broken pieces - it was to the point where I can't even pick them up with my chopsticks D: As some yelpers mentioned, the noodles were stacking together (near the end for me) . . .  What saved this review from getting a getting a 2 star.  1. Chives pockets - it was piping hot and flavourful :D Dip it in some vinegar and I was in heaven! 2. Popcorn chicken comes with sweet ketchup mayo dipping sauce 3. Avocado & Coconut milkshake was so creamy and delicious! 4. The Service. The waitress was courteous and gave us good suggestions :)  I REALLY hope the hand-pulled noodles are better or else I will have to travel uptown for my magical cravings :( I will be back again to try more food and update y'all... so hang tight!"}
{"text":"The magic noodle definitely lives up to its name. Hand-pulled noodles, made fresh to order for every dish. I decided on the triple B, beef broth with beef brisket, cilantro and spicy chilis. The meat was subpar, and the broth was above average, but the noodles were terrific, flavourful and had fantastic consistency. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came here after all the hype about the hand pulled noodles here. In terms of food I would give 3 stars, the texture of the noodles wasn't bad however the soup base was not as flavorful as other places I have tried. Also, my friends ordered the special and said it was too salty and only made it through half her food. However, the service is terrible. It might be open 24 hours but they are inattentive, not helpful and generally don't care about their customers. I wouldn't be back unless no where else is open"}
{"text":"I tried b3, \"the magic\", tofu noodles and seaweed salad. noodles are nice and springy, and as expected, the star of the restaurant. the broths are okay. the place is bright and clean. servers are inattentive. there are definitely areas of improvement"}
{"text":"I mean I really wanted to give 5 stars because I love hand pulled noodles like no tomorrow and they make pretty well but.......  Has anyone else ever has a stomach ache after eating here???  I feel like 3-4/10 times I come here I will get a pretty bad stomach ache...(my mom has gotten it, my boyfriend, my friends).. maybe it has to do with them being 24 hours and maybe their stuff isn't fresh.... I heard they were closed in the summer for a week for failing health inspections.... I don't know. Lol somehow I still find myself here taking a chance with the stomach ache and coming to eat here anyways.  But recently their beef in their noodle dishes have been super low q(all fatty pieces or some tendon barely any quality meat)...and now my boyfriend and I promised to never come again :(.  Maybe will come back one day in the future.."}
{"text":"The place has a nice modern look to it. Menu is a little different than the Scarborough location. I had the magic scrolls, popcorn chicken, and beef noodle soup. My favorites. I was not disappointed. Soup broth was great. The beef chunks were nice and soft. Tons of noodles. Holy I was so stuffed after eating there. I'd definitely go again. Perfect on a cold winter day. Beef noodle was the best. My family tried the other noodles and no complaints. Love this place.  Popcorn chicken is served really hot so be careful. But super delicious"}
{"text":"My go to place for late night food since it opens 24/7. It usually gets pretty busy at night, so expect to wait 10-15 minutes to get a seat. The noodles are handmade in house so it's really fresh. All in all I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant other than the service, which could be a bit better.   *this restaurant does not accept credit cards and accepts debit cards with a purchase of $20 or more so keep this in mind!*"}
{"text":"Given how much I loved this place before my previous negative experience, I had to give Magic Noodle another shot. And I'm so glad I did! We ordered the bbq buddies and magic friar and they were both great, flavourful, and arrived at about the same time (no more half hour wait between meals for me and my partner)! Everything I loved about this place was true again, lots of good noodles for a good price. Only thing from 5 star is maybe the appetizers are small for price, but still good. I'm generally happy with a main dish."}
{"text":"First time trying this place as it is always busy at lunch and dinner time. The menu is very good and the service is very attentive at times but when it is busy it can get a bit tedious as they will try to accommodate you the best they can. The food was overall excellent, with the hand made noodles was a bonus, will try next time. Other menu items are great as well. Hope they stay for a long time."}
{"text":"Great noodle place to the west of Markham.  Started out quite popular and great service.   But very quickly turned into a run of the mill quick stop super fast turnaround and get you out the door establishment.  I'll go back for a quick bite but understanding what I'm getting.  Note: my last visit I found tin foil in my noodle soup.  They offered my a new bowl but I was almost done anyways."}
{"text":"Magic noodle is located right beside Chako's of Scarborough. Its open 24 hours which makes it an awesome place to go to for a late night bite. I visited during the day around 2pm and even though thats a bit past lunch hours, it was still very busy.   The soup was great. It was less spicy than the ones Ive tried here before and it was all thanks to the chili oil being left out. Man....that was hard to eat last time.   Noodles: The noodles are my favourite part of this place. You can hear the constant thumping coming from behind the counter, so if you are familiar with the cuisine, you know what that means. They are hand-pulled, making them fresh and slightly chewy. Perfecto!   Serving size:  I ordered extra meat and noodles but only because I was REALLY hungry. I could barely finish my food. My brothers had normal serving sizes and they too were filled up by the end. We all got the large size and it did well for all of us.   Price:   Pretty much all the soups were priced around $10.00 or less. Obviously the extras cost more but they are fairly priced. Including my extras, we spent $42.00 before tip for 4 people. Not too bad!"}
{"text":"Noodle quality not as good as a year ago.. I went on a visit 2 weeks ago and the noodles were over cooked, soggy and didn't have the same al dente chewy texture as a year ago.. Different sifu at the noodle station.. Maybe he was tired and didn't want to pull the noodles as much?? Beef broth is still too salty.. But the lamb soup was decent. I wouldn't really recommend it after visiting it recently unless you're craving noodles in the middle of the night..   They are 24hrs.."}
{"text":"24 hour noodle joint! Recommended by a friend. No wait for late dinner on a Friday night at 9ish. I was told the place gets pretty busy later on the night especially after karaoke parties lol  What i ordered:  The house noodle Grilled pork chop noodles  Beef wrap Tofu skewers Lime lemonade   Noodles were freshly made in store which were delicious. Service could be better. I made sure to tell my server i want no greens, no cilantro in my noodle, and it still came with, so ofc i had to say something. And she tried to tell me theres no cilantro, just green onions. So i told her I specially asked for none of those and i can smell the cilantro. Then she unwillingly took it back and yelled at some lady at the back who preps that. Other than that, food came fast, everything was pretty good. I would say tofu skewers were my fav! Def a place that can satisfy my late night craves."}
{"text":"Magic Noodles? More like Tragic Noodles.  Look, I wasn't expecting much from this place's food after reading reviews from yelp but I decided to give it a shot anyway. It had listed a few of my favorite noodle dishes from when I lived back in China and I thought, maybe, just maybe they'll be authentic.   NOPE! I was wrong. The only thing authentic about this noodle place is that they screwed up my order. I ordered the lamb shaved noodles which is a form of noodle that they make by sliding a sharp knife along a huge loaf of chilled kneaded protein rich dough. Here is where it went as wrong as a liberal at a Trump rally.   1) They didn't give me lamb, they gave me beef. Now unless I am mistaken those are different animals. Actually I'm not mistaken; those are different animals.   2) They didn't put cilantro in my dish. It specifically says it comes with it and even says if you want it taken out you need to holla' at them to let them know because it seems like they'll put that green leafy goddess of a spice on everything. Not mine...  3) The noodles use a cheaper version of rice flour... not traditional bread style flour. I mean, how cheap do you have to be to use a cheaper version of flour. Look I'm Jewish, I get it, but to save 5 cents a lbs you end up with mushy, not chewy noodles.   4) Sugar... look I get it... you have no idea what you're doing but you don't put sugar in a rich savory dish like this. Spices like cumin, pepper, chili flakes, onion oil, all have their place here but the sugar was so pronounced I felt like I was eating candied rice pudding.   5) Overcooked food is a sin. There is a special place in hell for people that over cook noodles and still serve them.   I could keep going but in the spirit of valuing my own time I'll cut it off here. Don't eat here. Like never ever ever eat here... you're better off boiling a cup of noodle in your own urine."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style eateries are usually hit or miss and this one is definitely a miss. O.k, its open 24 hours, has fairly good pricing and a good selection of items to choose from. The bad? Under-cooked noodles (maybe they rush them when they are busy) and too many fillers (using more sauce and pastry when they should be using more meats and vegetables) Service is average here and they don't pay attention to small things like keeping your water glasses full. The dishes I had there were very bland and lacked the 'wow factor'. Its not very often I regret coming to a restaurant, but I definitely regret coming here, especially with so many great options in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"24/7 fresh hand pulled noodles what more can I say? If you're at Magic Noodle, I don't know why you wouldn't get the noodles. You can hear them being smacked and pulled and made with your own eyes. I only come here after really late nights so I don't have a problem finding a seat."}
{"text":"Came here late night with one of my friends around 11:30pm. I live right around the corner from this noodle joint, and when it first opened, it was actually pretty decent. Every time after coming back, I found that the quality had been constantly getting worse  Food - This time around, I ordered their regular noodle soup, served with an egg, porkchop, variety of veggies, and noodles. Noodles were hard. I kept wanting to cook them somehow, but I felt that I couldn't.   Honestly, if I were to choose a different noodle joint, I would just spend another 5 minutes to drive a little further to reach commerce area around Highway 7 and eat at a noodle joint there.  Good luck! Cheers."}
{"text":"Our go to place for noodles and asian food!  Their noodles are hand-made fresh on the spot which you can watch the chef prepare! It's pretty cool to watch while you wait for your food.   Being hand made and fresh the noodles itself is definitely the star of every dish - it's never too chewy or soft - always the right consistency. The broth they use is full of hearty flavour goodness (which the noodles soak up too!). Prices aren't bad either.  My favourite is the bbq duck & pork noodle soup bowl. They duck and pork is savory and always retains is flavour unlike most other bbq soup bowls where the soup soaks away the bbq flavour."}
{"text":"Best noodles I've had in the GTA!  Comparable to the hand pulled and hand cut noodles that I had in China, mmmmm. Portions sizes are good - couldn't even finish off my bowl.  Next time, I will get a large and share it with my husband.  Price is decent, nice space and you see the people pulling the noodles right infront of your eyes!  Although the wait is a bit long, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I decided to order from here on uber eats. I'll never order from here again! The portions for the meat were quite small. I also found the food tasted like leftovers that just got re-fried again. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tldr: handmade chinese noodle-soup place, decent price and good portions. Would not recommend this location unless you're really craving substandard service and filthy food.   Magic noodle is a chinese noodle joint that serves hand-stretched noodles and hand-shaved noodles that are made in-house. This place used to be really good for noodle-soup dishes when it first opened up. The food was delicious and the price was great. However, over the years in my opinion it kind of went downhill for this location.   The soups are more greasy and oily, and the service is terrible. Noodle consistency is still pretty good, and the price for the amount of food is not bad. But after eating a bowl of noodles i feel a little bit dirty on the inside and outside. The cleanliness of this location is quite questionable as well. From time to time i saw servers picking their nose.... and who knows what's going on with the guys who are making the noodles. Overall, if you're looking for sketchy food and crappy service then this is the place for you! Would not recommend this location, maybe the other ones are better if you wanted to try the magic noodle chain..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is usually filled after 6PM.  However, waiting time is usually short if you're not at the back of a line coming out the door.    The menu is not extensive in the sense of a pho restaurant that ranges from soups to rice to appetizer and etc etc.  They have roughly 10 soups with another page of cold dishes and another page of skewers.    The main language spoken here is Mandarin.  This honestly throws me and the waitresses off as when I order I speak Cantonese and they sometimes answer me with a big question mark.  BUT they are proficient in English & if worse comes to worst and they don't mind if you point at the menu itself to order.  I ordered the beef soup.  If you cannot finish a medium at pho - do not get a large here.  They bring you a huge bowl with a pile of hand pulled noodles topped with a variety of meats.  The soup base is so flavourful and it does not seem like they use MSG.  It comes out steaming out and it's perfect for a cold late night.  I also ordered the skewers and although I liked them and their flavouring - I didn't think they were worth their price. The cold chicken with hot sauce comes with a peanuty/bean sauce splashed on top. It didn't taste like much to be honest.  The restaurant has 3-4 servers running around taking orders - which means service and delivery of food is very efficient.  They also give you water with lemons - which I thought was a nice touch.  My ever-so-helpful boyfriend just nodded when I asked him what he thought of his soup.    Overall the price does match the quality as you will walk out of there stuffed for roughly $20.    This is not a quality restaurant during nights - you go in, you eat, and then you leave.  It's not a \"let's talk this over for an hour after we've finished eating (old asian parents style)\" type of restaurant.  I will definitely be back this winter."}
{"text":"My favourite noodles place. Compared to Japanese Ramen, these noodles are hand pulled to order. The broth is so rich and flavourful. You can tell that they have been stewing it for a long time. There is a hint of chinese medicine and does not have a fatty mouthfeel like Japanese Ramen. My favourite is the Magic Noodle Special Ramen with a Fried Egg, Beef Tripe, Lamb, and sliced brisket. If you like spicy food, try the G.I Ju, pork intestines in spicy broth. The popcorn chicken is addictive but portion is a little small. The cold appetizers are great as well. I love the cold shredded potato salad. Great spot for lunch so get there early!"}
{"text":"The noodles with braised beef brisket had a rich broth, but what makes it better than other beef brisket noodles at other restaurants are the beef briskets! Very tender and plentiful! We paired it with classic noodles and I thought the noodles were very well made (not soggy, not hard).  We also got the lamb with triad noodles. The triad noodles (shaped in a triangle!) were a bit thicker and a little more chewy than the classic noodles. I usually like thinner noodles so I prefer the classic but the triad was still well made. The broth for the lamb noodles had a herbal undertone which made for an interesting bowl. The broth had lamb flavours too and was not gamey at all. Once again, plentiful noodles and tender lamb.   My favourite dish, however, is not the noodles but their cold dish: a spicy chicken snack (I don't exactly remember the name!). The chicken is meaty and covered with this peanuty, spicy, sweet, satay-like sauce; it's really good!"}
{"text":"This place only takes debit and cash so be warned credit card users! The broth was very flavourful, however I found the portion size to be small especially considering that I asked for extra noodles. They give you lemon water by default as well - it'd be nice to have the option of having tea or plain water. I will definitely come back to try the other types of bowls."}
{"text":"Came here with my bf at 1am b4 and it was packed!! I thought it was pretty decent for a 24/7 restaurant. (Food wise)    Only problem was that our meal totalled to $5 short in order to pay with debit/credit i believe min was $20.... So we ended up buying 4 different pop drinks..... Otherwise the food was 4+   Advice: dont forget your cash or order more food. ^_^"}
{"text":"We ordered the basic beef soup and the brisket soup, pork jiamo (sorry if I messed up the spelling) which was DELICIOUS and two of their special drinks. We found the soups quite bland and the noodles were nothing special, a bit gummy and stuck together. I loved the avocado shake and would probably stop by for just that and something off of their appetizer menu.  Service was good and the restaurant was clean. Too bad we didn't much care for their signature dishes."}
{"text":"It was my first time walking into this place recommended by Ben!  I can honestly tell you that I had a wonderful experience here at Magic Noodle! We ordered a good variety including lamb skewers, squid skewer, and beef tendon skewer. All of which were amazing and perfectly grilled. We started off with a wonton soup actually, let me begin by saying this soup was the best it gets, a perfect balance of onions, shrimp, cilantro and silky wrapping of the wonton. The soup base held the entire dish together perfectly, simple yet complex! Then came the beef noodle, hand pulled noodle at its best, there's even a guy slamming raw dough in the background while you eat. Then came a pork/leek bao and a pork/cabbage bao which were perfectly steamed. The leek pancake took a little bit but well worth it!! The perfect balance of leek, egg and dried shrimp makes the entire experience heavenly! Not to mention the paper thin dough that holds everything together.  I will definitely be back to try their hand cut noodles and other small eats!!! Until then, this is at the top of my list of places to go for a food orgasm!"}
{"text":"We ordered two appetitizers (??? & ???) and a bowl of beef noodle. Food is not bad..would like more sauce in the ???"}
{"text":"It's a great location but the service is poor. The entrees listed online are not available in the restaurant. Tried to call the number on their website repeatedly and the voicemail isn't activated. Walked down and I couldn't get past the hostess stand without experiencing poor customer service. While waiting I noticed everyone who had asked for assistance seemed frustrated and repeated their request from ordering water to requesting the bill. Based on service alone this place isn't worth the effort."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for years now but unfortunately the experience was less than satisfactory. When we walked in the server sat us right next to the door even though there were a bunch of seats available. I asked for a seat away from the door but she completely ignored me. We also waited for a long time for the food as she forgot to punch in our order. No sorry or anything. Food was also bland and salty. Next time you're craving noodles try a nearby Pho restaurant instead."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, and every time I leave satisfied. They're more of a no frills, no bull(pardon my French), kind of restaurant.   My go to item is the triple B because I can't get enough of that beef brisket. The meat is tender, and the broth is deep and flavourful. Definitely give it a try. My only gripe is that I wish they gave more meat. I always run out of meat before I finish my noodles.  If you're feeling a little more adventurous give the pork intestines (GI Ju) a try. It's chewy, fatty, and delicious. I've tried a few of their other side items, but nothing compares to the noodles.  Also, this place may be open 24/7 but I've never seen it empty. I usually don't have a to wait for a table, but space is limited, so just a heads up."}
{"text":"This noodle restaurant is still a decent place to grab a late night meal, but the quality and quantity have been on a bit of a decline over time. Must say they were much better when they first opened. The main perk of this place is that it's open 24/7 year round. I'm more of a fan of hand-pulled noodles and this place used to be pretty good for that however the texture of the noodles were terrible the last few times I've been there and they seem to make up for that by adding more MSG in their soup.   Their snacks such as the cuttlefish, the grilled tofu, and the potato pastry are still quite good but this place is sadly no longer my top choice for noodles. I only go if I'm looking for something other than McDonald's on a late weekday night."}
{"text":"This place is open 24/7? Yes it is and on most nights, you will know why. This place is crazy with customers with a waiting line that goes out the door. Not fun when it rains or the dead of winter.  The atmosphere is your typical Hong Kong Style Chic place with a clear view of the kitchen at most tables. If your lucky (or unlucky, depends on how you view it) you can have the table just outside the chef making the fresh noodles and get reminded that he is there when he slams the dough onto the table. This is not to freak you out, but it is traditionally how the noodles are made, and they are delicious. I usually get the braised beef noodles and it is very tasty. Portions are ok, I find it a bit small for my liking.  The lamb kabobs are tasty aswell but seem so bare when you order 1 or 2. They usually serve your lemon water in a plastic pitcher which doesn't look too inviting but I did drink from it and all is well.  Staff are your typical \"get your seat, place your order and here is your bill, pay me and get out\". Take no offense, it is just the way the factory runs.   That being said, I do find myself going back every once in a while and it always satisfies my hunger for noodles in soup."}
{"text":"my friend introduced my to this place tonight. i was really hungry after a long day of driving and im told this place is open 24/7 but dont' quote me on that. the noodles are hand made, you can see them stretching, shaving, swinging, and whatever it is that they do with the noodles.  point is, the noodles are made fresh and are delicious. i ordered the sliced noodles beef brisket and it was bomb. i really like it, the beef was nice and tender and didn't get stuck in my teeth. the soup was delicious. and the noodles were cooked to perfection. based on just the food, i'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The noodles were alright, as expected. I had originally come at 3AM for a mid-study break, however the restaurant was closed... originally advertised as open until 5am. The menu barely has any English, which will confuse non-Chinese speakers. Great for a snack, isn't anything special."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My brother kept raving about how great this place was and I can see why he loves it so much. However, for me, soup noodles need a strong soup base, and unfortunately Magic Noodle, though with fantastic QQ noodles, is below par on its soup, and I have trouble rating it as a 4 star place. Between my mom, my brother, and I, we had marinated pig's ears and intestines, and three noodle dishes. My mom got the orginal lanzhou ramen noodles, I got the spicy intestine knife-cut noodles, and my brother got the cold ramen noodles. The cold dishes were just okay, while both type of noodles are fantastic. The only weird thing is that the ramen is not cut and it goes on forever, which makes it difficult to share. You can ask them for scissors if need be. Again, the soup bases were really meh. The cold dishes were kinda gross cuz the intestines were full of fat. .  What did wow me, however, is there house chive/garlic leek boxes. The stuffings were so full and delicious - i believe it is the best i've ever tasted. I would go back for those, and maybe a noodle on the side.   The services is really great there but i am hesitant to give this place a 4 star, as I'm just not crazy about eating there in general."}
{"text":"Hand made noodle soup - good but doesn't stand out from others  Location/decor: - The restaurant is located on the south side of 16th avenue. If you miss the early turn in to the plaza, you'll have to do a u-turn at Valleymede to get back in to the plaza. - We went early on a Saturday night expecting it to be quite empty but it turned out the place was busy - Inside you will find a modern and clean looking set up where you can even watch the chefs in the back pull and pound the noodle dough on the counter. Very cool to see!  Food: - The menu is quite good with a combination of soup noodles, dry noodles, hot/cold appetizers and grilled snacks. - We ordered the following: Magic Noodle Signature Beef Noodle Soup, Hand Pulled Noodle with Roast Duck and BBQ Pork, Fried pancake with leek and Grill squid tentacles. - For the noodles, we ordered the small size which is definitely quite filling and the noodles came by very fast - matter of minutes after ordering. However, when it arrived, the food did not quite look like the menus. But appearance is not the only factor.The soup base was tasty but I found the toppings for both noodles to be a bit of let down e.g. my beef noodle has a pieces of beef and porkchop tucked underneath the noodles and soup while the other only had 3 pieces of duck and 2 pieces of BBQ pork. The noodle themselves were great - chewy and thin which worked with the soup.  - For our snacks, the fried pancake with leek was a hit! Crispy outside while stuffed with leeks inside - must try it with the vinegar! However, the grilled squid was a miss - I was expected a bunch of large tentacles on the skewer but it was tiny little piece. It was also quite chewy and it did not taste good.  Overall - I give it a thumbs up for the noodles and soup but the rest could be improved upon as more toppings would have been better. In the huge flood of noodle places, this one is good but it doesn't quite stand out from the rest."}
{"text":"?????????? ??10??????? ????????? ????????10?? ????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ????????? ??"}
{"text":"24 hours is a plus, so its a nice late night snack or place to go. But yeah it was OK, nothing too outstanding, not the best but not the worst either"}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese noodle soup, good place for casual meals.   The food waiting time is short, probably they pre- made most stuff. The noodle is good, however, the beef I had is bit cold. I asked my boyfriend, his pork is cold too. That's why I would give them a 4 star instead of 5.  The place is not that spacious, the tables are too close. You can always overheard others conversations. I believe takeout would be better.  The satay lamb/chicken are pretty spicy. Should try it out if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"Truly a 2.5 star review.  It passes but not by much.  It is more a show than sitting and enjoying or maybe I just don't know how to appreciate this craft.  I ordered a braised been hand cut noodle, chili oil on the side.  When it arrived the presentation was OK but there was very evident the chili oil.was added in.  Took a taste of the broth. It was OK.  A bouquet of spices but not as rich as what I have read about.  The noodles were OK,  could of had another smack or two on the counter to build up more gluten/ chewiness.    The brisket was braised for a long time but somehow lacked beef flavour.  And after consuming a big bowl of noodles did find myself a bit thirsty. It is open 24 hours and lots of parking to fulfill people's needs when ever necessary"}
{"text":"2.5   First off, I love noodles..especially in soup.  Unfortunately Magic Noodle needs to up its tricks. We got their Magic Beef and Triple B, both with hand pulled noodles.  Food arrived pretty quick, piping hot with good amount of noodles. I have to say I enjoyed the springy texture of the noodles, but their broth is too bland for my liking. I also did not enjoy the spice they use (Allspice? Cumin?) as that's all I could taste.  It's a shame because they have a nice, clean interior and service was wonderful. So maybe I will give it one more try next time and hope they improve."}
{"text":"Very delicious!  Shared lunches with friends. Had the knife cut noodle with beef brisket and grilled tofu skewers.  Highly recommend as it's also 24 hours and for noodle fans!"}
{"text":"Magic noodle in Scarborough is known for its fast-paced, no nonsense approach to noodles, but the harbord street location offers quite a different feel.   There isn't the same rushed feeling and it is a more relaxed atmosphere. The best thing about magic noodle is that they're a great alternative to all the other noodle/ramen joints and their selection is awesome. I almost always get 'The Magic' with the ribbon sized noodles. Usually I get a few lamb skewers too. Portions are gigantic and the pricing is so competitive.   While the broth is still pretty good, i think there's some room for improvement."}
{"text":"The quality of the food went downhill. I came back for the heavenly sliced noodles and it was not as tender as I had it the first time. The soup was not flavourful at all however, they did give me a good portion of lamb.  Poor customer service is a given here. My friend was served a bowl of noodles with half the soup that she was supposed to get and her noodles weren't even hot. We asked the server and she told us that they ran out of this kislnd of soup. I was applaud. How can you serve your customers half the amount and not even inform them that there wasn't soup left anymore?! In the end, beef soup was added and this time she got a full bowl of soup just like how it was supoosed to be.   I don't think I'd want to visit again due to poor customer service and the quality of the noodles. Perhaps, I'll seek out another location."}
{"text":"Ive been here numerous times and this if this accident didn't occur I would give it 3.5 - 4.  I've been to magic noodle at all sorts of hours and the food is normally pretty good. This time I ordered the tomato and egg with hand slice noodles - my favourite, get it all the time,  for take out. I get home in about 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant and started consuming when I got home. I saved half for a bit later. After about 30 minutes I go back to finish the other half and I open the lid to the soup base and it had bubbles all over the top and smelt like really strong stinky cheese. I held up the container to my ears and I could - I kid you not,  hear it bubbling... Grossed out, I emptied it out.  I tied it up and waited for the morning to throw it out. Garbage doesnt open til 7am and I waited exactly at 7am, because at this rate my whole kitchen smelt like stinky cheese. Oh yeah, I'm writing this while trying to survive this case of food poisoning. TT_TT"}
{"text":"Noodles are great, and you get a different variety to choose from. Also, there are lots of nice little snacks to share as well. My wife and I personal like the sliced noodles the most. We find that the taste and texture is better than the other ones. The portion is just perfect for us as well, as we don't eat a lot, so the small size is perfect for someone who doesn't eat a lot. Although the food is great, all the other aspects of this place isn't that great.  Lineup - Depending on when you go, the place can be really packed, and you'll have to wait 30 min or so to get a seat.  Cleanliness - The place might feel a little dirty, as there is a huge traffic of customer, the staff doesn't have a lot of time to keep the place clean  Service - Also because of the huge amount of customer, they are sometimes a little under staff, and so the service can get a little rough."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple locations of this noodle restaurant chain, and the experiences have all been mediocre. The smell of the restaurant is strong and not very appealing, but that could be because I don't like lamb. The noodles and the broth were ok, but the toppings were quite minimal for the prices they charge. I would choose a lot of other noodle restaurants over this one."}
{"text":"Despite the average reviews I actually loved the food and service that was provided for the past several times I've been here. We stumbled upon the restaurant while we were nearby and we were amazed by the food. The restaurant is pretty cramped as they try to fit as many tables as they could in the small seating area that they have.  We've tried the Magic Beef noodle soup, friar, cuttlefish balls, and tea eggs here. The noodles here are fresh as they're hand-pulled. The broth bases are packed with flavour and coupling it with bouncy noodles makes it my favourite menu item here. The tables have black vinegar and chilli oil which can be used to add to your noodle soup as it's frequently done so. The friar looks unpleasant to the eye at first but it's actually pretty decent in terms of taste. You need to try the cuttlefish balls! I don't know what sauce they're putting on them but they're so addicting to eat.  The great thing is that they also do takeout and leave their takeout containers near the front. If you ever do decide to take any unfinished food home, you can help yourself to the containers."}
{"text":"Having been to their other location at North York, I was hoping that the noodles at this location will meet my taste expectations. We came here during the weekday lunch hour and surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all. Unlike their North York location where you place your order at the counter and sit down for service, this place is a full-service restaurant.  I ordered the lamb noodle soup, magic beef noodle soup, and lamb friar. Both of the noodle soups were incredibly delicious in terms of the broth and hand-pulled noodles. There was a generous portion of noodles and meat so it is quite possible to share one bowl amongst two people. The friar was also amazing as the noodles were bouncy with a perfect amount of sauce and flavour.  Service was above average than what you would typically receive from a Chinese restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and polite.   Would love to come here again if I'm nearby Chinatown. I would say out of all of the restaurants in Toronto Chinatown, this one is my favourite!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Hand pulled noodle is MAGIC!  I love the sound of fresh noodle slapping and whipping, it makes my heart goes pitter-patter.  Magic Noodle is a brand new noodle place that open in Scarborough recently. The deco is chic and young, the price is reasonable... MAGIC!  We ordered the following to share:  Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef ($7.99) - Noodle perfectly done: great bite, cooked just right - The soup base was surprisingly good with a slight delicate flavor of cumin - This is what I consider as hand made ramen, the traditional way with no machinery  Beijing Style Sliced Noodles with Soy Bean Paste ($7.99) - I always love hand shaved/sliced because of the more chewy and heavy texture, reminds me of pappardelle - I found this noodle a lot more filling and would satisfy my carb craving!  Cold Flavoured Assorted Vegetables ($3.25) - Cold veggie was A-OK to munch on while waiting for your noodles - Cloud ear fungus, tomato, cabbage, cucumber and of course hot pepper!!  Goubuli Pork and Leek Bun ($0.99)  Service is kind of awkward though. No tea was offered and when I asked for some, I got served with hot water?!   Right now Magic Noodle is opens till 11 pm but in the future as their business card states will be opens 24/7?!! Seriously, I can have Noodle anytime I want?!!  This must be MAGIC!!"}
{"text":"Opens 24/7  If you have cravings for comfort food, look no further than Magic Noodle! On a rainy night or 3 am when you have this \"I need something to eat!\" urge, I suggest to give them a visit! Of course, you do have the option of McDonald, Tim Horton's or even making an instant noodle at home... but a fresh bowl of handmade noodle?!   This location is self serve. You ordered at the counter and paid upfront and your noodle will be cooked to order for you. This is the only location that has built your own option.  Service though is lacking. You have to ask for a glass of water, then they would give it to you. The other locations, you are served with water without requesting!  I will be back at those wee hours to satisfy my noodle's urge when I am in the area. I guess it is kind of Magical when you can have something decent to eat in the middle of the night?"}
{"text":"I am excited to see Magic Noodle is doing its magic up at Richmond Hill.  This new location is much better the one ar Scarborough. The interior is a lot more spacious, hence more seating and love the bar seating against the wall. As a frequent solo diner, the wait would be significantly shorter.  For this location, there are wait staff that can speak Cantonese or Mandarin and English. Some are even speaks all 3. Communication is not going to be an issue. The colorful menu with nice photos makes ordering super simple.  My Langchou Beef Noodle ????? ($6.95) with the choice of noodle (??) was really well made. The soup is hot with nice herbal aroma. The star of course is the Magic noodle: cooked perfectly with great texture and bite but not doughy at all.  Hopefully this Magic Noodle would opens 24/7 like its Scarborough location. But for now the hours is 11 am -11 pm."}
{"text":"The reviews confused me as it did not represent my experience. The service was quick and friendly and she spoke pretty good english (maybe it was just the day).  The noodles were really good too. I've had hand pulled noodles before but not like this. These (classic) noodles were stretchy with a bit of bite and did not fall under their own weight. Not too chewy but not hard at all. Great value for the price, they definitely did not skimp on the noodles and filled the bowl up with broth which was delicious as well. The meat was quite tender and flavourful.   I would have to go to more hand pulled noodle houses but I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"The fried noodles were very greasy. I know that you can't fry something without oil, but you can drain off half a cup of grease before you put it on a plate."}
{"text":"Without Yelp I would never even have known that this place existed in Scarborough! Even when I got to the plaza it was a little hard to find, the English name was really tiny on their sign and we circled around the parking lot twice before we realized where it was. When we first entered the restaurant, we were slightly horrified by the size of it - it's pretty small and cramped - and the fact that there were a shit ton of people crowded in the doorway waiting for a table. I think we were somehow really lucky in terms of timing though, because three tables left shortly after we arrived, so in the end we only had to wait about three minutes to be seated.  We ordered a few different things to try; my parents and I all got the hand-pulled noodles but with different ingredients: the house special (it came with a pork chop, some beef, and a fried egg), noodles with lamb, and noodles with fish balls (also came with crab meat.) We also got a skewer of sizzling tofu and a lamb skewer. What they say about the noodles is true - the texture is just amazing!! I don't think I've EVER in my life had noodles like this that are just the perfect mixture of soft but not soggy, and slightly chewy. I also loved the soup base, which was lightly flavoured and not too salty! It was actually really refreshing. I will say that I thought it was a bit too oily, but on the whole I still really enjoyed it. I got a small house special for $7.99, and it was a good size for lunch. For an extra dollar you can get a large, but I didn't think it looked that much larger. The tofu and lamb skewer were... very flavourful. They come quite heavily seasoned, and I can see why other people would enjoy them. For me I found whatever they put on them to actually be a bit too spicy. I will say the texture of the lamb skewer was probably the best I have ever had though. It was super moist and juicy, whereas most other places usually overcook them and make them too dry. But this was just perfect.  Service at most Asian places is usually mediocre at best, and I'm like pretty accustomed to it, but I thought our waitress today was particularly bitchy and basically barked out answers to our few questions and looked thoroughly displeased. I wasn't too impressed with her. They did bring our food pretty quickly though, probably within like 5 minutes after we ordered. Also keep in mind that they only let you pay with debit if your tab before tax is $20 or more. For what we ordered, our bill was just over $30 for three people, which is really reasonable!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after a movie. The food was pretty good. The noodles tasted great. Had a wonderful texture. The beef noodle I had was very flavourful.  I would've gave this place a 4 star. But the  beef noodle only had 4 tiny pieces of tiny beef. That I didn't expect that from this type of dish. The beef was good but still overly tiny. One star lost!  Hopefully next time I go again it will be fixed."}
{"text":"The home made noodles, pulled or sliced were amazing. I highly recommend this noodle place. the biased beef or pork was extremely tender and flavourful.  This is my go to place for noodles and it is 24 hours."}
{"text":"Its pretty darn good and it's 24/7. Enjoyed the delicious hand made noodle. Good prices, 8.99 for a large size. Lots of parking too, can't complain."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving ramen, unfortunately all the ramen places near us close early. So we decided to get noodles and after searching up what's nearby and open, this place came up.  The place itself was very clean from what we seen, which was a huge plus.  The service was pretty good, the staff walked around to make sure we got everything we wanted and to see if we were doing okay.   I got Triple B with classic noodles and wow it was so good, I loved it! The noodles were good, but the broth itself was amazing and the beef pieces were pretty big. I got the small size and it was more than enough for me. The portions were huge and worth the price.  I will definitely be back!  P.S. they are open 24 hours & only accept cash and debit."}
{"text":"Very tasty! The food definitely lives up to the name. I ordered the Shanghai stir fry noodle and the classic Lanzhou beef noodle soup. Everything tastes very fresh, and you can even see the chefs making the noodle by hand. Super cool!  A few pointers for the daily noodler: - free soup refills!!! This is very important since the noodles absorb soup over time, and they don't give you a proportional amount of soup  for the large slab of noodles in the dish - extra noodles does not mean extra noodles. Spare yourself ur buck and just upgrade to a large/ buy another bowl - the leaf cross section noodles are my favourite : ) - the fat flat noodles taste best stir fried  Would consider coming here again.v"}
{"text":"I tried this place over the weekend. There is a huge crowd that goes there, so if you plan on going, expect a line up!  I had mixed feelings about this place, as I had mixed reviews about it. I honestly wasn't really hyped up about it, but I wanted to give it a try, since it's hand cut noodles. Nothing can go bad with hand cut noodles right?  I ordered their beef noodle. There was limited sliced beef, and it was really tough beef. I found it too tough for my liking. The soup base was okay, I was hoping for something stronger. I think they need to add more beef to it so the flavour will be there.  I didn't find the noodles to be amazing. They just tasted like...noodles. I guess they do taste fresher than the usual frozen ones or 'fresh' ones at the grocery store. They give a lot of noodles, which I suppose is what fills you up.   If you're just out to get a bit bowl of noodles on a cold day, then this might be the place to go, but I honestly think there are better places for noodles and cheaper noodles than this place. For myself, I don't think I'll come here again, but if I do, maybe I'll try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Stir-frys are the best thing there. I would say it's sort of reasonably priced but you do seem to get more on your plate when you sit down over take out. The food tastes very good there overall though and definately worth a try. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner. By the time we left around 7 the place was 80% full but we were not impressed.   - The noodles were ok texture, u can tell they r fresh but so many were clumped together.  - The broth was just not good.  It was like beef powder and water. In order to add depth to the broth you must use a large amount of the the condiments on the table and add soy sauce, tons of chilli oil, pepper to the soup etc. broth was not good at all. No complexity, no umami, no richness. It did NOT hold up to the noodles.  - The toppings on the noodles were gross. Not fresh. Scrap pieces of meat, one price of tripe. We both got the magic, which comes with a fried egg. It was obvious the egg they put on top was pre-fried and sitting out for hours because it was so rubbery and resembled bean curd. They fried it hours ago and it tasted like shit. Same w the meats.  - Apps were interesting in terms of selection but mediocre in terms of flavour. We got the seaweed salad and the pig ears. Again, you have to use those condiments at the table.   - The tea they serve comes in pitchers and they are room temperature. No hot tea. How friggin lazy do the staff have to be to have everything prefilled, pre prepared, pre fried, etc etc. nothing was fresh.   Won't return or recommend."}
{"text":"Stumbled in with my boyfriend the other week to try out bites in our new neighbourhood. The cashier helped us make noodle decisions and we ordered the Magic Beef and Triple B along with an order of garlic sauce wings.  It was surprisingly busy for a -30C night but we managed to get a table not long after ordering. Service was quick and we were swiftly brought out our meal. Broth was hot, flavourful and the noodles were perfectly al dente. Portions were also very generous for the $8-$10/bowl pricing.   It is quickly becoming a neighbourhood favourite for us !"}
{"text":"I had a delicious late lunch of Szechuan cold sesame noodles. The portion was large. Good service, quiet space and a nice escape from a busy street outside. There is a lot on the menu so it took a while to choose, but I'm happy to have had a very satisfying simple dish. Excellent noodles."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for a quick dinner; had the Tradition Lanzou beef noodle (number 1 on the menu), beef brisket noodle, and sesame pork burger. Portion is small; large noodle soup is not very large and its $8.5. You generally will get a larger portion at most Chinese restaurants for that price. Hand pulled noodles were alright; kinda expected better. Noodles were \"stiff\" and hard. They were skimpy with the meat: there were very few thin slices of beef in my noodles.  The pork burger/sandwich was bad; boiled sliced pork drowned in salty hoisin sauce. It was very salty and grease and lacked flavour. We each took a small bite out of our halves, and left it behind."}
{"text":"This place has decent service, plentiful noodles, and a good amount of customers coming through.   Like someone else has said in their review, the actual bowl you get looks nowhere near as appetizing as the pictures. It does look sloppily put together, but since I'm only there to get a quick meal, do I really care? Of course, presentation is important, but it's something I can let go for this place. My only complaint is that while there were lots of noodles, the meat to noodle ratio was completely off. I ordered the lamb noodles, and the pieces of lamb were tiny and bony. Highly disappointed.   Good to try out for a first time, but I don't know if I'd frequent this place. On the plus side, they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"This place definitely feels like you are warped back to Shanghai. They have great noodles that are hand made and it is very fascinating to see them cut the noodles in front of you. Though they are a little light on the toppings and the extra skewers and appetizers are quite pricey. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and what is better then  they are open 24 hours! Definitely can help satisfy that late night craving for some noodles! If you go during regular times, I would warn you that the line up could take 45 mins depending on your luck."}
{"text":"a lil slow and packed at the beginning.. but noodles were fresh and soup was good.. has a cumin taste in it and salty enough you dont need to add anything to.  i got the pork bone one .. you will have to get your hands dirty with that one..  this place is 24 hours now so if i need to get my noodle soup on in the middle of the night i will know where to go."}
{"text":"We have been ignoring uptown new offering recently and have been sticking with some old favorites. So sticking with our ramen addiction, we went for some traditional Chinese hand-pulled noodle ?? instead (Chinese Ramen).  We arrive at Magic Noodle ??? for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed with quite a wait but the service and turn over time was pretty quick. We got our table within 15 minutes which was very acceptable in my opinion.  Cold Flavored Assorted Vegetables $3.25 ~ We saw most table ordering this and decided to give it a try.  ~ It was just slightly pickled veggies which was sweet and slightly tangy which was a perfect side to the noodles.  Sliced Pork Foot in Soy Sauce $4.99 ~ Another cold dish but I have to say that I'm a bit bias on this since I like mine hot and melt in your mouth version but cold ones are more \"al-dente\"/springy in texture. ~ But this was very flavorful and Ben did love it.  Sizzling Tofu $1.50 ~ Not sure why it's called sizzling but it was just your typycal Chinese BBQ skewers (they have a few meat options).  ~ Love the sweet sauce here together with the typical Chinese skewer dry rub mix.    All the noodles are made fresh constantly where you could see the process through their open kitchen which they didn't allow me to video or take picture thou  They have 2 types of noodle here, the regular hand-pulled ones (Lamian ??) and the hand cut noodle which is where they hold a large piece of dough and slice it with a special cutter over boiling water/broth.  Hand Pulled Noodle with Beef - Small $6.99 Large $7.99 ~ We decided to go with the most basic one since it's our first time here and it was amazing with perfectly cook noodles, pho like soup and tender slices of beef. Just like pasta, you can definitely taste the difference of fresh hand-pulled noodles.   Sliced Noodle with Traditional Braised Pork - Small $6.99 Large $7.99 ~ The sliced noodle are thicker and here doughier (almost like rice cake) which I love while Ben prefers the noodle.  ~ This one didn't have soup but was tossed in the braising liquid instead which can end up being rather oily for some people but I do find it perfect with the thicker noodle while I can't imagine it with a soup which may end up being rather bland for this. ~  And let's not forget about the pork which was packed of flavors of soy sauce, spices like anise and  cloves.  Fried Pancake with Leek $2.99 ~ Made fresh and served pipping hot, this was perfect for these cold winter days with the perfect crisp exterior to the moist filling of leeks, egg and bit of vermicelli.  Verdict : ~ Love everything and will definitely be back real soon, maybe for take out to avoid the the crowd. ~ Super affordable, authentic and delicious ~ Perfect for our stay-uptown weekend ~ Service are almost non-existent just like most Chinese eateries but here they expect a 10% or less tips  P.S - Cash Only"}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of hype about Magic Noodle lately, so I finally tried it out for myself. I arrived around noon on a Saturday and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad considering I've heard horror stories about the wait.   I ordered the classic hand pulled noodles with sliced beef. The first shock was that the bowl of noodles that arrived looked completely different from the picture on the menu, which showed a bright red soup base deeply coloured by Chili oil. In reality, we had to add chili oil ourselves. After getting over the initial shock, we devoured the noodles. I liked the texture of the noodles, and the soup base was decently flavourful. It was also extremely filling. But overall, it wasn't special enough that I'd be willing to wait for more than 15 min for.   I also tried a meat bun (gou bu li), which they offer individually for $0.99 each. It was pretty good and also quite filling.  All in all, I would come back for pulled noodles, but perhaps not during peak lunch/dinner times."}
{"text":"Magic Noodle's new expansion to their late night eatery is in my opinion, not so magical. The establishment itself is actually quite modern and the appliances are all new and spiffy, but the food is supposed to be the main star of the show, and unfortunately, it was not.   I ordered \"The Magic,\" which has a lot of random stuff included. I was excited because the pictures looked very yummy and appetizing, but when the actual food came out, it was uninspiring and quite sad looking. Yes I know it's not supposed to look the same, but the differences are big. It was also an ok taste and size. I was not that hungry when I came, and I was not that full when I left. Magic Noodle is known for their tiny appetizers, but I am pretty sure their prices went up so all the dishes are $4 and up. This makes me not want to order anything because the money issues are real and I can get 2 McDoubles next door instead of a small plate of seaweed salad. The service was inattentive and uncaring.  I give this place 3/5 because while the menu is nicely updated and the decor is modern, the food quality was not amazing and the service is lacking. This place is quite a drive for me and I wouldn't come back again unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"They're noodles and sides are below average. Nothing stands out to me. Been here twice and won't be going back anymore as was not impressed in either occasions."}
{"text":"Very quick lunch here. The taste is ok. Recommendation when you want to fast food and want to try Chinese noodles."}
{"text":"Their noodles are awesommmmeeeeee!! Pot belly and triplle b are my fav! Highly recommended! I don't really give comments but their food and service really makes me so impressed!"}
{"text":"Because too many days I didn't have Chinese food. This restaurant was good enough to taste the Asian food."}
{"text":"Love that this place is open 24 Hours!  Service was super speedy and quick!  They were very attentive without being overbearing.   The food was delicious but the meat in the dishes tasted kind of old? Not juicy or particularly amazing. The noodles are great. I ordered the dragon wontons noodle soup and the wontons were pretty tiny. The broth was yummy but it also tasted like Top Ramen chicken flavoring which makes me think their food is incredibly unhealthy and I probably shouldn't have it any time soon again.   However this place is a really great deal for noodle soup, so great if you're looking to be cheap and don't mind how unhealthy it is."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, there's always people waiting outside. From the noodle to the snacks, most of it was a bit on the saltier side. The soup base was tasty but got really thirsty after lunch, there might have been too much MSG. The braised beef was tender and very easy to bite. The noodles itself was well made and had good texture but was too salty.  Overall, maybe go back months from now."}
{"text":"Came in during dinner time and it was full, luckily there was a table leaving so there wasn't much of a wait. They said to sit down at the unclean table first and totally forgot to come by later to clean up. The tip from the previous customers was still sitting on the table. It was also a task to try to flag a server down. They seem to make eye contact but then go in the opposite direction.  Hand pulled noodles are consistent with the other location, the entire meal was very familiar. Good standardized product, this location is much bigger and can sit a larger party if needed. The sliced noodle definitely soaks up a lot of soup so it would be wise to eat up while its fresh and hot. The braised pork was really tender and fatty, very delicious. Only disappointing thing was the soup. It just seemed like a soya sauce soup, probably the braised pork liquid. Would be nicer if it came with the beef or pork soup from the other noodles.  Overall, noodles the same as the other location but service was worse so will stick to the other place closer to home."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the noodles here. Freshly made by the chefs and you can watch them as they prepare it!  Recommend the braised beef noodles."}
{"text":"Haven't been back since they opened.  Meh then.  Meh now.  The only really good thing about them is that they are pretty economical for fresh noodles. Maybe things will change in another 1.5 years.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Great price for homemade noodles. I ordered the beef brisket soup (or I think that's what it is called) and it was delicious. They have these tofu skewers that are definitely worth a try. Will be back especially since it is 24h."}
