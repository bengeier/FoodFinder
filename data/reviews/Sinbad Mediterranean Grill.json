{"text":"The food here was ok. I ordered the chicken shawarma and it was a bit greasier than I anticipated. The salad was also greasier than anticipated.  

The staff was friendly I just wish I had ordered something else as all the grease I ended up just throwing my meal away half eaten. 

I'd try it again but will likely stick with vegetarian dish."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kabob wrap and it was delicious! Service was fast and the lady was very friendly!"}
{"text":"For mall food court food, Sinbad is great. For actual Mediterranean food, Sinbad is great!

It's an amazing surprise to find fresh and delicious food at a good court. The falafel is some of the best that I've had. The salads are always fresh, as are the hummus, baba ghanoush, grape leaves, basically everything that I've tried.

It definitely takes longer to get your food here, as opposed to the other places in the food court, but it's so worth the wait. If you want something fast, go elsewhere. If you want something delicious, go to Sinbad."}
{"text":"You want to try the best falafel in Pittsburgh?  It's.... wait for it... in a mall food court. Not only is Sinbad by far the best food choice in Monroeville Mall, there's something for everyone here.  They even have a separate vegan/vegetarian menu with everything clearly labeled!  (For the carnivores, my husband went nuts for the chicken kabobs and said they were the best he's ever had.)  Well worth the trip from the North Hills!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place, so I figured what the hell... Wow am I glad I did! I got a shawerma with the standard toppings plus I chose to make it spicy. The taste was phenomenal and the price $5.99 was acceptable. There was no line and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma in Pittsburgh! Generous portions and good prices. It's a shame it's in a food court."}
{"text":"It's fantastic! An Egyptian kind shop owner gave a piece of chicken to us, which made us order 2 dishes. The taste was beyond my imagination! I kept eating until ate it up. Meanwhile if you want to know some stories about pyramid, you can chat with the shop owner :)"}
{"text":"Great mall food but the last time I was here total was 7.48 and the man didn't bother to give me the change.  I had to ask for it.  Could be unintended but I don't think so.  We are turning into a third world country.."}
{"text":"Monroeville Mall was far from busy when a friend and I decided to grab a quick bite after seeing a movie at the mall's under appreciated Cinemark theater. She was looking for a vegetarian offering.   The food court was virtually empty.  All but one of the food stands had its name on a large sign indicating what kind of food was served.  There didn't seem to be any options for her until we noticed Sinbad's smallish sign, in the corner next to Subway.  

A quick glance at the menu confirmed she would have several options.  While placing our order other people (apparently regulars) lined up behind us.  

The food was more than ample and really good.  I ordered the gyro platter - a generous portion of lamb gyro meat on a bed of rice, a small salad, and gyro sauce on the side.  She had the red lentil soup, the plain salad, and baklava for dessert.  

Did I say generous portion?  Perhaps I was already half full from the movie popcorn, but I brought home a snack sized portion of gyro meat with rice. I swear there were two scoops of exquisitely seasoned slightly sweet rice in my order.  

And something happened you never experience at a mall food court.  The cook/owner came out to talk with us.  He is proud of the fact that nothing is prepackaged.   The dressings, sauces, desserts, etc are all made in house. He truly appreciated our accolades and answered questions about the preparation of our meals.  

We'll be back.  

And if it means anything there was a sign stating \"we serve halal,\" despite serving a shawarma wrap with pork."}
{"text":"I loathe Monroeville Mall. It is the pit of hell.  I had to go there today to run an errand with a family member.  We were really hungry and against our better judgement we went to the food court.  Much to my surprise there was an excellent Mediterranean grill.  Who knew you could have a good, fresh, healthy meal in the midst of suburban chain restaurant hell?

Their kitchen was incredibly clean, their menu large, the service extremely friendly.  I got a baba ganoush wrap.  The pita bread was great.  Everything is made fresh in house.  Veggies were good.  What a nice surprise.  While I don't hope to find myself in Monroeville Mall anytime soon, I would certainly eat here again if I were."}
{"text":"I love to try new foods and the food at Sinbad looked great. I'm so glad I decided to try it! I got the chicken kabob platter and it was excellent. The chicken was seasoned well and the rice had a nice flavor to it. You get a good amount of food you for the price. Restaurant was clean and the woman at the counter was friendly. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"While staying near the Monroeville Mall, I was looking for a place with some decent vegetarian meals. Found Sinbad and was impressed with the freshness and quality of the food. Would definitely recommend trying them out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Delicious! We avoid malls typically but went there just for the food because of great reviews here on Yelp. The kind of restaurant that would be jammed in other areas. evidently Monroeville doesnt know what a gem they have in their midst. We had chicken kabab in a pita wrap, and sides of grape leaves and humus. YUM, Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food I've found in Monroeville. I've actually stopped at the mall just to eat here. Do yourself a favor and get the shawarma platter. It's excellent food, more than I could eat, and it was inexpensive. Falafel is also very good."}
