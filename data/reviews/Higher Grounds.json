{"text":"This is a drive through kiosk: so a bit of a 'no frills' coffee vibe, but they serve up a great americano.  I came back the next morning for brewed coffee which was also good. I give the espresso beverage the higher rating of the two.  If I ever come back to the area I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Great coffee in the morning. Sandwiches and cool drinks in the afternoon. Only place to get good coffee on the hill in Madison. ."}
{"text":"This is the only coffee shop on the hilltop and sadly, I wont be back.   I pulled in for coffee and the gentleman had the radio inside loud enough that he couldn't hear my order.  He made my drink wrong and when I asked him to correct it he huffed about.  He handed me my drink and I said, \"I asked for whipped topping\"  He insisted, very angrily, that I did not.  I asked for my money back.  We exchanged mutually frustrated comments, but in the end, if you want a customer to return, you treat them right.   Sorry, folks...I'll take my money to another coffee shop that has a more pleasant atmosphere."}
