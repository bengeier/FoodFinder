{"text":"Food is excellent but not professional.  i complemented the cook he wasn't friendly. I usually take out. I don't like that ambience..Biriany Not meaty enough n  portion became smaller. I find it pricy."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Indian/Pakistani food. Definitely worth a try. Avoid if you aren't big on bold flavours, spices, chilies, etc. 
Highly, highly recommend the tandoori chicken and any of the stewed meat dishes."}
{"text":"Ok spicy actually really means spicy here! For those who are looking for the mecca  Pakistanese and Indian of take-out restaurants in Montreal, look no further. Open 7 days a week until 11:00pm every day, you can find an elaborate variety of 17 types of curries, 7 different types of balti, 10 types of biryani, 14 assorted vegetarian dishes, 10 Pakistani naans and the list goes on. Personal favorites are the lamb vindaloo, chicken bhuna, shrimp jalfrazi, bhindi and dal channa. Ask for different levels of spice to get a feel for the difference - you won;t regret it!"}
{"text":"old and ugly restaurant.  the food is FIRST RATE.  excellent.  it really is not the the cover but the content that matter here."}
{"text":"Les plats sont excellents. Je recommande le kebab masala. Le seul reproche est le lieu: prenez votre commande pour du take out. Vous ne serez pas decu."}
{"text":"I ordered vegetable biryani and butter chicken for take-out. The biryani was ok (but not great) and the butter chicken went into the garbage after a few bites as the chicken was rubbery and tasteless."}
{"text":"I used to work here a long time ago when mister Larry owned the restaurant and they had the best food around. On my last visit to Montreal I tried it with the new owners and it didn't taste as good. The food was bland not enough spices. But it's still good if you live in the area."}
