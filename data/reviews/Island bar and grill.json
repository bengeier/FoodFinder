{"text":"Island Grill is not closed. They underwent renovations, added a full kitchen and now serve great food. My friend loved his NY Steak, which was cooked medium rare, just as he ordered it. I had the chicken tacos and enjoyed them. It's a fun, friendly place."}
{"text":"Wow, I've never had a worse time... went there 2 weeks ago

Horrible place. The owner was using the word \"faggots\" all night, it was really classy, \"faggots\"? wow. DO NOT GO HERE, SHARE YOUR MONEY & GOOD TIMES WITH OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS, THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"This bar can easily be labeled as a weird bar...the layout is weird the patrons are weird drinks are extremely watered down & overpriced...there is 1 good thing i can say about this bar is that the bartenders are top notch down to earth genuinely cool people...other than that no dice.. Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Torri is awesome.  She made me feel at home.  Very low key place with great prices and a great vibe.  Ask about what to do and where to eat she will steer you in the right place.  Good to know a friend in Vegas.  Thanks Torri."}
{"text":"Always fun and one of the best bartenders in Vegas, the unforgettable Tori. She's committed to making it impossible to not have fun and skilled as they get behind the bar. I have yet to leave without a smile and some fun memories."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a drink after work. The bartenders are so nice an make you feel welcome. Misty is so cool. I love talkin to her. They even have karaoke. Its the place to chill. I go there often."}
{"text":"I went late on a Thursday night. Lots of gamers and drinkers. The place is a bit divey but that's what I like. It was decorated like a tiki bar. Had a few pool tables and TVs. Stevie at grave shift is awesome. :) Neighborhood is a little harsh. I would go here often if it was closer to home."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other night. Closely located by downtown, so my gf and I are always looking for a nice local hang. The staff were very friendly. The food was good and prices were right. The house wine was under $5. Good hang for locals. Ps and the restrooms are clean!"}
{"text":"Trying to find this bar, but Yelp has no app for Windows phone, so it's impossible to navigate here. Trying to pull up reviews, to no avail."}
{"text":"I was looking to pick up a quick bite to eat on my way home from work. When I called the bar I asked for a takeout order and the lady proclaimed that they don't do takeout orders! WHAT?!?!?! Its 2018!! Do yourself a favor and avoid this crackhead Corner infested bar and treat yourself to Steiner's Pub!! Not only do they do fancy \"takeout\" orders, the food is delicious and they have graveyard specials!"}
{"text":"Really solid local bar. Cheap drinks and expansive food menu at very reasonable prices. Great service from staff. No need to go out of your way to seek this place out but certainly if you're in the area and are hungry or thirsty you should consider stopping in."}
{"text":"OH MAN! This place was really fun.

I came during karaoke night, and it is a really non-judgmental, laid-back karaoke scene here. 

We kicked off our experience with a nice pitcher of my NEW, old stand-by Hamms. After a few glasses, my friend decides he wants me to get up there and sing. Even though my voice was jacked up from laughing my a*s off all night! But he begged, so I decided to give the best rendition of Ginuwine's \"Pony\" I could muster.

They LOVED it, surprisingly! I had two guys ask me to go up and sing again. And they loved my cheesy dance moves that I had thrown in to mask my utter embarrassment. Who would have thunk it, huh? 

While there, some crazy, super drunk guy accused the bartender of taking his leather jacket. Mind you, she's like 5'2, small and seemed really nice. The dude flipped out and punched one of the game machine screens!! Luckily, two regulars quickly stepped in to subdue him and take him out.

They have a good selection of tap beers, some pool tables and some slot machines (in the bar and a few stand alone). They had a small menu of some bar snacks, like egg rolls. I liked the island decor, with the huge fish tank in the back. Good times."}
{"text":"Cheap and divey! My kind of place. Karoake was great, James kicks it up there, great place for that. The drinks were poured nicely (read: heavy) and the beer was cold. What more can you ask for? Bottle service you say? Go to the strip for that you fool. Give this place a try, classic Vegas ambiance style bar. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Casual tiki decor
Definite locals
They do allow smoking, and you can tell they fry a lot of food in the kitchen; billiards, pool, video gambling; fair prices, no happy hour; probably won't make a directed effort to come back"}
{"text":"This is the old Office 7 bar.  (A few still exist) Vegas' local bar. Friendly staff and welcoming customers telling stories of years ago! 
Fry bar food available for cheap.  TAB beer. And all the usual bottles of goodness. Large seating area and a EXCELLENT JUKE BOX.  A pool table and great GAMING BONUSES."}
{"text":"Cool tiki / island bar theme. Has the feel of being inside a cave. Drinks are cheap and well poured. Lots of t.v.'s and a stage for karaoke and open mic night. Occasionally they have live bands."}
{"text":"Came out to Island grill for the first time Saturday night...well ok, Sunday morning, at about 2am.  

I really like this place.  Very open, spacious, clean, with a \"tiki hut\" kind of feel...

Tero, the bartender, was incredible, pouring REALLY strong drinks!

Drinks are super cheap and good here.  I can't believe I waited so long to come out.  
I'll go back again soon."}
{"text":"Service is great. Bartenders work very hard to please everyone. Burgers are overcooked but delicious. All priced at $5. Fresh French fries are worth the trip here. Yummers. Soft pretzels are tasty and warm. NY steak is tough, but cheap and filling. Machines are good. TV viewing is great. Kitchen is in full view. Right in the bar."}
{"text":"Great locals bar, have a decent bar food menu, most of the items are around $5, 1 pool table, cheap drinks beers come in 3 different size glasses, single beer, pitcher and they have a beer tower that is almost 100oz. $10 domestic, $13.50 import. They had music and karaoke but construction has halted that. Pretty decent internet based jukebox and plenty of TV's to watch the game or what ever else may be playing. Over all its a pretty kick back place to relax."}
{"text":"Always a great time with great people. Excellent fun efficient bartenders. Great place to hang out with friends. Never a dull moment. Great service and very good food. Drink specials galore. Love this watering hole."}
{"text":"I went here with my out of town guests to redeem a match play deal advertised on the bar's Web site. It's a typical neighborhood poker bar with a tropical theme (love the small waterfall) and tiki decor. Any place that offers a match play is a winner in my book, though we didn't try the food.
The bartender offered to serve the Blue Moon with orange juice, which is also a winner. 
This is a Steelers bar, and as such, promos and prizes are offered during all games."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! It's always a pleasure to see a lot of locals hanging out. Very good priced and quick service. The bartenders are nice and accommodating.  My bf ordered a wrong drink and then asked them to bring him another one. The ladies didn't charge him for his mistake. The food was excellent too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great local spot all the food is great bartenders are amazing thank you hats off to Amy and Tony they are the best I'm in here almost every day since I was 1st in and love the place me and my girlfriend love it"}
