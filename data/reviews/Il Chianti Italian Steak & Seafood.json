{"text":"The food here was excellent. Far better than any overpriced Italian I've had on the strip. The wait staff was friendly, and Rudy the owner/head chef stopped by often to make sure everything was perfect. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very friendly staff, terrific food! Must try adobo nation and lemoncello dessert. The Filipino fusion dish was unlike any dish I've ever had at an Italian place, and it was fantastic. I can get lasagna anywhere, and this dish really show cased the chef's background and his Italian focus. Don't be afraid to try something new. The chef frequently came out 2 or 3 times) to our table to greet us and ask if the food was to our liking, I am sure if you didn't like something he would make it right. This is our new favorite Italian place!"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Seattle, one of the things I miss, and feel Vegas is lacking, are high quality truly local neighborhood restaurants.  I am delighted to say, I found one of those rare gems tonight thanks to Chef Rudy.  The food was outstanding, especially the Lynn Pear and Cheese Tortellini.  The Chicken Marsala was also delicious.  My five year old couldn't eat the meatballs fast enough, and after stealing a bite from her I could see why.  The food is only part of the story. Chef Rudy interacted with every customer, making us feel like family.  It wasn't a forced interaction, but a genuine heart felt greeting and welcoming into what after a few minutes felt like his home and not his business. He couldn't have been more sincere.  We will most certainly be back to enjoy Chef Rudy's food, hospitality, and company."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  I dont know how it is open, because it never seems busy.  The food is good.  It it higher class than you would assume, given its location.  The chef/owner is often there and gives it a personal touch."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had the lasagna and fettuccine and both were great. Very friendly environment and great service. Very nice people. The bread sticks are amazing. My kids devoured them."}
{"text":"Go now!!! This is a gem!! Impeccable service, delicious food, cozy atmosphere... Go on a Saturday night and there is beautiful live music."}
{"text":"Gawd, I love this place.  Found it driving nearby one time and now I eat there whenever I'm in the Las Vegas.  It's worth the drive to Henderson.  Was just there earlier this week when I was in LV for business.    Doesn't look like much from the outside because it's in a strip mall, but it's very nice inside and the food is freaking great.  The service is great too.    I'd eat there for the bread alone."}
{"text":"Well...after my expensive disappointment a few weeks ago at Giada, this was a nice hidden Italian gem only minutes from my home. It is nestled in a strip shopping center on Horizon right off the 95 heading to the Hoover Dam. It is a very quaint restaurant that probably has about 16-20 tables, the decor is very tasteful and well done....but the food is truly the highlight of this place.   So we were sat down and they took our drink orders and then our waitress Rosa came by and ask is if we were doing appetizers. We requested the calamari and an onion soup (yes I know it was 116 degrees outside, but I really wanted one). Then the owner, Chef Rudy, came by and he could tell it was our first time here so he brought a little something extra as an appetizer. So first came out the fresh bake bread with your traditional olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was very good, but it also came out with a chunky tomato sauce that was also very creamy at the same time and had really an exceptional taste. Then, came the calamari and the French onion soup the calamari had two sauces and one of them was sweet and tangy. The French onion soup was thick and not too salty and the guyere cheese was melted perfectly. Then, Chef Rudy came by and brought us two slabs of pork belly in adobo!!!! You need to ask for this when you come it, it was amazing and full of flavor. I just wanted to lick the plate. Then, for our main entr√©es we ordered the risotto pescatore and the Lynn Pear and cheese. I had the risotto, but I am so anal about having shells on my plate that I asked Rosa if she could shuck the mussels for me and she did. My plate was huge two to three people could have eaten from it. I brought enough for lunch tomorrow. There were scallops, shrimps, mussels and clams and the Risotto was cooked perfectly.   Now my husband had the Lynn Pear and Cheese and oh my god, it was one of the best Italian dishes I had in a long time. I would say that is their staple dish based on a lot of the reviews a must have if it is your first time there. The Pear is not overpowering but it gives the plate some interesting flavors for your palate. Chef Rudy came by again and he was making rounds to all the tables being very attentive and telling us about brunch and special events there and we will definitely come back.   For dessert, have the Lemoncello Gelato it's not to overly sweet or bitter from the lemon but the sauce that goes over the gelato just tastes so good. This place is also very economical and the plates range from 18-25 dollars for an upscale restaurant with the majority of the ingredients made in house. Chef Rudy mentioned to us, if you don't love to cook and have the passion the food is just not going to come out right, the food was amazing so  I take it he is very passionate about his food. Everything was fresh and made to order.   So, if you are looking a for a new restaurant and venture out this is the place for you. Yes, it maybe 15-20 min from the strip in the eastern part of Henderson off of Horizon and the 95, but trust me, you will not be disappointed. Rosa, thank you for the amazing service too you rocked and we will be back very soon to try your brunch."}
{"text":"Don't drive by!  This place is in a strip mall and you think \"cheap Chinese\" until you walk in the door. The menu is extensive and the service is superb. Food is awesome too. To bad we have to fly back to cincinnati tomorrow. Great place and great time."}
{"text":"The food. The food. The FOOD. Most delicious thing the ever graced my taste buds. I wanted to just eat the appetizing bread, was the softest bread I ever had. I ordered the cheese tortilini and I was absolutely fantastic, great portion size, and the sauce is out of this world. Great service, Nice relaxing music playing, a peaceful quiet atmosphere. Really a nice fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Hubby loved the lamb with risotto, I had fettuccine al fungi it was delicious. The lava cake ....melts in your mouth, would recommend to everyone.  Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The food is excellent great service my second time here and I plan on dining here alot"}
{"text":"Great new little Italian restaurant, intimate setting and outstanding food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in Southern Nevada. Entrees are $21 to $25. Quality is great. Everyone was happy with their meal. Obviously not chain restaurant food. Service was awesome and friendly. Order bottled water, regular tap water is bad. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I got to come to Chef Rudy's restaurant finally. It exceeded my expectations. Chef Rudy's food is amazing and he is an awesome guy. I really recommend coming down and checking it out and you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Chef Rudy is amazing!  The egg rolls are delicious. The flavor combinations are genius. Will definitely be back with friends"}
{"text":"Very very good !! New Year's Eve and the food was fabulous!! I'm sorry we didn't get here sooner! The sauce was great and service was excellent!!!  We definitely we'll come back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with a personal touch!  I had the orange roughy special and my husband got the chicken alfredo.  Both were very good but the roughy was exceptional.  We also highly recommend starting with the shrimp bruschetta in a spicy vodka sauce - melt in your mouth deliciousness!  The chef/owner visited all the tables and was passionate about the food and brand.  Highly recommend!  A hidden gem in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and quaint location. Only complaint is how hot it has been in there on a few occasions."}
{"text":"Most amazing Authentic Italian restaurant I have found. Just like I had growing up in Naples Italy. Thank you so much Chef Rudy for making our fantastic meal today. This restaurant is a family friendly place and also romantic at the same time. Very professional, knowledgeable, and attentive staff. We highly recommend IL Chianti to anyone looking for the best Italian restaurant in town! Totally worth our drive from San Diego CA!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! Fairly priced! This place is now in the permanent rotation of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this restaurant. Food is so tasty and nicely served. Rudy is great, comes to your table to make sure everything is good, which it always is. Service is great, kudos to Rose and everybody else. So happy this gem is in our neighborhood. My husband always orders the Cioppino and I order something different every time and have never been disappointed. Thank you Rudy and staff."}
{"text":"Five stars? You bet! Il Chianti IS as good as it gets!! Papa Rudy has created such a lovely intimate atmosphere for dining. Soft lighting, great music, friendly service and the food, OH MY GOD where to begin about the food? It is phenomenal!! Can't recommend just one dish, they're ALL exquisite!! We LOVE Papa Rudy's interpretation of classic Italian dishes. Its so good you want to lick the plate! One of the best things about living and/or visiting fabulous Las Vegas is the myriad of dining choices. If you leave Las Vegas hungry, it's your own fault! I would highly recommend Il Chianti as one of those choices."}
{"text":"The staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly. The food and wine selection is amazing! My son could have had his 21st birthday anywhere in Vegas, and he picked IL Chianti.  Thank you Chef Rudy, Rose and the rest of the staff for creating such a special memory. I highly recommend this local restaurant. I can't wait to try their lunch and brunch."}
{"text":"Really awesome Italian food. Really awesome servers and owner! A place to make memories. I love on the west side and think about this place every time I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"Service is always great here. Food good, but risotto had way too many peas. Overall, very good."}
{"text":"No way is this place $$! The food is good. The waitress asked, \"Would you like soup or salad?\", which we took to mean that it was a part of the $20 - $40 meal. The petite salad, which comes with a vinegarette dressing on it, was big enough for us to share and still not finish because of the size. The dressing was good. The french onion soup was delicious - it was kind of thick, with lots of onions, a slice of french bread, and cheese on top - nothing like the other reviews here say. The capellini al pomodoro was good with lots of flavor. The carbonara della nonna had more pancetta than my taste, but otherwise delicious. Chef Rudy came out and chatted with us for a few, which was great. He replaced the salad with dressing on it for a dry salad on request.   All was great, until the surprise on the bill - $9 for soup and $7.50 for the salad."}
{"text":"New Italian restaurant in town. One of the best Italian restaurant I have ever been too! The ribeye and spaghetti must try. I'm crazy about tiramisu and this place has the best one so far! The head chef Rudy intruduced himself to us and greeted my family. The service is AMAZING! Ask for Ross, she is wonderful and gave excellent service!"}
{"text":"Greeted at the door by a chef as he was hugging goodbye the patrons leaving his restaurant.  Ordered lumpia, chicken masala, truffle risotto with veggies and lemon cake with ice cream. Delicious, but pricey for Hendo. We'll continue to support this business as the food, atmosphere and grateful staff make for a great date night treat."}
{"text":"Loved this home owned Italian place. Chef Rudy came out to make sure I was happy with my food! I had caesar salad, seafood pasta & homemade lemoncello gelato.  I loved the ambiance & quality of food!"}
{"text":"Our experience couldn't have been better. We were looking for a quick late lunch after swimming and happened upon this charming italian restaurant. Chief Rudy greeted us, sat down with us and told us a bit about the restaurant.  The spaghetti and meatballs was fabulous. I ordered from the Sunday brunch menu: lemon stuffed french toast, omelet, and fruit.   The French toast was awesome, crispy and filled with a wonderful lemon filling. (It was like a dessert) We will definitely go back on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner and to listen to the jazz for a date night. We usually like to eat out during the weekday when restaurants are less busy, so lunch or dinner, this will be our place to go to treat ourselves to great tasting food, friendly staff, and very personable Chief."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for a fine Italian meal.  The chef talked with us ahead of time and the food was excellent.   A little too much for me to eat and as we were passing through, couldn't take the leftovers.  Our server was a little spacey--didn't have our reservation (but no problem as the early crowd had gone) and walked by with our check although we were only one of two midweek tables still there!  But the food made up for those little bits. Plus the music was great--Broadway/movie show tunes in Muzak.  So figuring out what was playing (if you are into that) was fun. Great bread, great salad, great dinner and great dessert."}
{"text":"Dining at Il Chianti was an epicurean's delight. The ambiance, staff, and food was great. This restaurant, tucked away in Henderson, was a fortuitous find. I highly recommend everyone to check it out."}
{"text":"No joke the best bread starter I've ever had. Light breadsticks toasted with some cheese crisped on the outside, and he makes by hand a balsamic reduction to dip it in. The owner greeted us when we got there, there was a guy playing some music, great environment, amazing food. Quiet, next time we won't bring our two toddlers lol good thing they served the food quick so we were in and out!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant delight. We came here while visiting family who live there in Henderson. We also were there with family visiting from Brazil. Everyone enjoyed their meals and found if to be prepared with quality ingredients which makes all the difference. Don't let the location or size deceive you of the quality of food they provide. We had very good service as well. Good food takes time to prepare."}
{"text":"So incredibly impressed by this place! Authentic Italian with amazing staff. There must have been 4 diff people serving us. Friendly and personable with delicious dishes. Tried a unique entree with pear and cheese - a bit risky flavors but it was incredible! A must try. Will go there every time we're in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"This was the worst food I've ever had, it cost $100.00 for my husband and myself, and all we were able to eat was the caesars salad and the bread sticks. I had chicken parm and pasta with alfredo sauce, it was unedible, so salty, it was as though they emptied an entire bottle of salt on the food, and this is coming from a girl who likes salt. The French onion soup tasted as though it had a bottle of soy sauce dumped into it, and it had less then a teaspoon of cheese on top. My husband had the chicken piccata, it to was unedible. It tasted as though you were biting into a raw lemon, it was so strong it even made your mouth pucker up. Diner beware, also we both were sick after eating here."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Henderson and beyond, bar none. We've been enjoying Il Chianti for two months now, 7 visits in all, and every time the food, service and ambiance have been nothing short of impeccable.   We met warm-hearted Chef Rudy Janeo on our first visit, he greeted us enthusiastically at the door, and checked in on us several times throughout our meal. This is one highly experienced top-notch Chef who is extremely passionate about his food and his guests, who truly desires to bring you the very best dining and entertainment experience. And it shows. Truly a one-of-a-kind extraordinary chef who serves each meal with kindness, laughter and genuine feeling, makes you feel a part of his family from the start.   On our most recent visit two nights ago, live soft jazz was playing which set such a beautiful mood throughout our entire meal. Thank you Chef Rudy, we loved it!!  We were greeted and seated immediately, and within two minutes had some of Chef's famous pillowy bread loaves with a balsamic and olive oil dipping sauce. These rolls are fresh, warm, flavorful and addictive, and are generously served throughout your meal.   Now that we've had a chance to meander our way through the beautiful and lengthy menu, here are some of our repeat favorites:   *Apps* Involtini di Michelle -- An extraordinary crispy-light lumpia, filled with fresh-crisp hot veggies and wrapped in butter lettuce with thai basil and an amazing sauce drizzle. Plus sweet chili and wasabi aioli for dipping. So delicious, we order this every single time, you should, too!  Calamari & Onion Ring Fritti -- Fresh and light calamari and onion rings combined with a spicy marinara and just the right kick of jalape√±o cream. Never greasy or heavy, just perfect!  Burrata Caprese Salad -- New to the menu and therefore by request only, but if you love burrata (fresh mozzarella filled with fresh cream, gently aged to perfection), it's a definite must-order, with thick-sliced real tomatoes, red onion, capers and eggplant.   *Mains* Linguine Fra Diavolo -- Succulent jumbo shrimp and basil leaves in a bold marinara sauce over fresh linguine pasta...I like to add a bit of fresh spinach and I could eat this every day all day long, it is that good!  Lobster Ravioli with Blackened Shrimp -- OMG need i say more, this is an incredible dish full of love and character, beautifully prepared with asparagus and an amazing vodka tomato sauce finish  Lynn Pear & Cheese -- Most recently tried this popular specialty combining rock shrimp with homemade cheese and pear tortellini, the to-die-for vodka tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese baked atop. You can't go wrong with this one, it's compelling and creative and oh so delicious.   Cioppino Alla Livornese -- Outstanding flavorful broth with abundant lobster, shrimp, scallops plus clams, mussels, salmon and more. Trust me, you're going to want extra bread to soak up all the delicious flavors!  Hubby swears by the Chicken Scallopini, Veal Piccata, and Spaghetti Bolognese...best he's had, bar none. The Italian Sausage is large and in charge, two fat juicy links of wholesome Italian goodness.   You really must save room for one or three of Chef Rudy's outstanding desserts, all lovingly prepared in-house. Lemoncello Gelato, Tiramisu and Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e are must-have favorites, and new surprises are appearing all the time. Honestly, we've never had a better or more beautifully flavored Tiramisu, ever!  Il Chianti is a small drive for us from Boulder City, but we would gladly drive twice as far to experience truly extraordinary Italian cuisine at its freshest and finest. Say hello to Chef Rudy whenever you visit, he'll be delighted to meet you!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which I enjoy more, the food or chatting with the chef. The food is delicious and the staff is lovely.  A perfect place to take guests if you want to impress them with a delicious Italian meal.  It does get pretty noisy and crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings. Reservations are highly encouraged at those times."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a good restaurant in the neighborhood! Waitstaff was very nice and food was excellent. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Portions were generous. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant's customer service is extremely good. Very friendly and very attentive staff - from seating hostess to chef! Chef Rudy has trained his staff well.   First the bread (we learned in Italy, years ago, it's a good indicator of whether an Italian restaurant is going to be good) was good - nice and hot. I was a little disappointed in the olive oil with which it was served - not very flavorful.   For an appetizer we ordered the grilled marinated baby lamb chops with mint served with figs & a wasabi sauce. They were recommended by the chef/owner as he came by to welcome us to his restaurant. They were amazing!  Main courses: I ordered the Lynn Pear & Cheese which was pear-stuffed cheese tortellini with Rock Shrimp, spinach, mozzarella baked in a tomato vodka sauce. The sauce was just a touch salty, but otherwise very good. Dish was a good balance between the savory and sweet.  My husband ordered the veal scaloppine and loved it - said the veal was delicious, pasta was al dente and sauce was very good.  No room for dessert, even though they all looked yummy."}
{"text":"We found this wonderful place by looking get on yelp and it was the best restaurant we have found.  Chef Rudy cane over and visited.  Checked on us several times.  Food was fantastic !! Atmosphere fantastic! All the employees made you feel comfortable and were very friendly.  You can tell they all enjoy their job!  Laura and Billy bob Thornton :) 2/10/18"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came with our daughter (3years old). Delicous food.  Kids menu is great. Our daughter loved her spaghetti.  Good service.  The cook came out and Shook our hand.  Sangria was great. So many good things to say."}
{"text":"The food tasted delicious, big portions. Noodles and seafood cooked right. Even the serving of seafood are enough. Place is really hot and humid, maybe AC isn't working right? We were sweating! The service was a little bit slow. Chef came out and was very nice and welcoming as he greeted every customers. There garlic bread is really good, probably the best i had as well as the red dipping sauce, im not sure if its called marinara but really delicious.   We will come back but i hope AC is working."}
{"text":"Great place here in Henderson!! Don't let the strip mall fool you!  Food was excellent! My Hubs had the chicken parm! I had chicken picata! Cooked perfectly with great flavor! We even had enough to take home leftovers, Win!!! Service was great! The Chef was so personable!  They make their dessert in house!"}
{"text":"This is a place that cares about what they are doing. From the hostess, to the waiter, to Chef Rudy who may visit you at your table.   Its in a strip mall but that's not what matters.  The food is wonderful as is the service (Roger).  I just ordered what Roger told me was good (Adobo nation) and my wife had the liguini Mediterranean.  Bread is hot, sparkling water presented like champagne, and home made desserts.  Chef Rudy has assembled a great crew. I am jealous of the locals as I was just passing through town."}
{"text":"I love this Italian restaurant. The food is amazing. I had the baby lamb as an appetizer and  cioppino with angel hair as the main course. Chef Rudy was very nice and came to every table to greet his customers whenever he could. Everything was  Delicious!!  Service was exceptional! I  will be back for more... I will bring my friends and family here too."}
{"text":"Went for dinner Saturday evening with friends, we were seated and taken such good care of from the beginning. Roger was our server, he was wonderful and his recommendations were spot on. You will not leave there hungry as their portions were huge! We enjoyed the live music and the upbeat yet intimate atmosphere. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic Italian food.  We will be returning again. thanks so much"}
{"text":"I was enjoying what I've ordered and at the same time busy trying out everyone's dish. Good thing we came right before they close coz that would have been very embarrassing. And the chef, chef Rudy was just very friendly and accommodating. We will surely come back for more. Thank you. The food was really good and the portion was just perfect."}
{"text":"Very successful & fine establishment due to the unique combination of mixing Italian with a Filipino twist that you really can't find anywhere else! Chef Rudy, along with his staff Rose & Carlo have surpassed our expectations when we held our son's baptism reception at IL Chianti. We couldn't have asked for such better, superb service, such great quality in food  & wine  and yet the feeling of a welcoming family all in one day! If you are ever in the Henderson area, please make sure to visit IL Chianti-- you won't regret it! Chef Rudy & his awesome staff will take great care of you and most of all, your taste buds will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As soon as we were seated we met Chef. He spoke to us for a few minutes and made us feel welcome. My mother actually suggested this for my birthday and we both live very close to the restaurant. Both of our meals were great we both had a pasta dish. I ordered the linguine Alla Mediterranea a linguine with shrimp, scallop, asparagus, brown butter sage and white truffle oil. It sounded amazing. When our dinner was brought to us I was so stunned by how beautiful it looked I started pulling clams out of the shells and couldn't wait to taste it. At about the time I got all of the clams out, I realized that I was staring at linguine and clams. The waiter walked up and asked how everything was. I said, \"I bet this is going to be amazing, but it's not what I ordered\". I didn't want to send it back since I had already pulled all of the clams. It was amazing non the less and this experience gives me good reason to go back and try the Mediterranea. There are a ton of awesome looking dishes on the menu. Give this restaurant a shot. You'll love it and you'll go back.  *Update* - I returned last night 8/14/16 and had The Mediterranea. It was great and everything I had hoped for. I also had the Vegetable Egg Rolls. They were very light and tasty. Chef Rudy has this place under control. It was quite busy too so plan your dinner by maybe making a reservation."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Chef Rudy, Rose, Roger, and their team are amazing! Such wonderful hospitality and the food is divine. I've been here 3 times and loved everything I've tried: the signature carbonara made in the peccorino cheese wheel, lobster bisque, fresh breadsticks, bruschetta, eggplant Siciliana, and the list goes on. My personal favorite is the chicken piccata.  The service here is extraordinary and Chef Rudy is so passionate about his food and his guests' experience in his restaurant. My family loves coming here."}
{"text":"How about ILL in my stomach from this food rather than il Chianti! The execution is poor. Shell fragments in the linguini with clams that almost broke a tooth. Breadsticks that tasted worse than Olive Garden. They don't even have balsamic vinegar because the reduce it into a sweet, disgusting syrup-like balsamic reduction mess.  Wine list selections you would find in a one buck chuck wine list at PTs Pub. All this for a whopping $8-10 dollars a glass. Boxed wine quality at its finest. I suspect these great reviews are from the owner's friends and family. Owner is non receptive to feedback, however, is overbearing in trying to glean compliments from you by visiting the table frequently.  Way overpriced-save yourself the time and the nauseous feeling and go elsewhere when you're in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"Not great - steak and chicken pretty tough. We didn't enjoy the experience or the food all that much."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day and I understand holidays are busy but WORST customer service ever. I will never return. Claustrophobic, poor quality food. But we still enjoyed each other's company. Also forced tips suck when the service is so poor..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in town!! The people working here make you feel like you are old friends visiting their home for dinner. They go out of their way to make sure that your whole experience is wonderful. Thanks Chef & team for providing such a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this spot a bad review, as they're a small neighborhood restaurant and I don't want to discourage that. However, after standing inside the restaurant for several minutes without being acknowledged by anyone, we left! The space is very small so it was obvious that we were standing there waiting to be seated. Multiple workers looked at us (including the chef, who was out greeting a table), but no one spoke to us or offered us any assistance. Not even to say \"We'll be right with you!\" To add to that, the restaurant was stiflingly hot, to the point that patrons were fanning themselves with their menus. We also noticed that none of the people seated had food on their tables. We decided to leave. After we walked halfway to our car, a waitress came running out and offered to seat us but we told her it was too late. We went to Ventano, were immediately seated by a very nice hostess, and had great food & wine."}
{"text":"Fabulous Food! Love the Lambs and lots more... Great Service! good Ambience? Chef Rudy is very personable and charming"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.  We had the cuban sandwich. It was delicious. We will be back Wednesday night for dinner and the ribbon cutting ceremony. Everyone was so friendly. The chef came to our table and introduced himself.  Very nice place."}
{"text":"Love that we found our friend Rudy just down the street!  Loved his food at Ventano and thrilled to find him in his own restaurant right by our house!  My chicken piccata was spot on. daughter adored her first dish of lasagna and hubby's definition of great Italian is their eggplant parmigianasean . He gave it 2 thumbs up!!!  Thank you, Rudy! We're so happy your near us!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had a cooking class with Chef Rudy. I can't say enough positive things!  He sat down and got to know us. He went over the menu. We picked out our dishes and we made what we chose. We had one on one time in the kitchen with Chef Rudy. He is passionate about cooking and his school in the Philippines. Our food was fantastic. I highly recommend!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Culinary explosion. I forgot how wonderful this place is. A terrific family restaurant with fantastic flare for favor and exceptional service. The lumpia egg rolls have fantastic flavor as do the adobo mushroom and dates albeit rich. I have had the cioppino which is fantastic especially if you spice it up. The chef is incredibly talented and can tailor every meal to your taste. The wine selection is fantastic. They have an incredibly fantastic pasta dish that is made in a cheese bowl drenched in fresh flavor. They have great specials throughout the week and on Mondays you can even book private parties to cook with the chef.    Make sure you put this place on your bookmark for any night out.  You will be back again and again."}
{"text":"An amazing local find, with Strip quality gourmet food and unbelievable service. You walk in a customer and leave as family. Had a celebration dinner last evening. Lamb chop and Pork Belly appetizers are sensational. Pasta Mediterranean, a second time winner.  Veal parmesan the best ever. And the Cheese Bowl that finishes off the pasta is just incredible and my little grandbaby gets to be Chef. Portions are very substantial and there is a great ambiance. We've been back four times and this has become our favorite place. Ask for Rose as your server. She is just so attentive and fun. Chef Rudy is so personable and makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Food was excellent.  From the bread to the entree which was lobster ravioli.  The lemonchello(spelling) was to die for.  Rose the server and Rudy the chef made our visit pleasant and made us feel like we were old friends.  This a must for Italian food. I will go back often to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. We had just moved out here and hadn't taken advantage of a good Italian establishment. After rummaging through the many Italian spots and reading reviews we chose Chianti's. Where do I start, well the service was superb. What made my experience great was when the owner Rudy sat with my wife when I and just had a great conversation about life. Eventually that conversation led to food and his history, which was interesting. When you talk to Rudy it's like he's been your friend for years and you just want to bring others around him to experience that.  On top of the great conversation he has an amazing staff that's very attentive and cares about the restaurant just as much as the owner does.   Now the food, WOW. Rudy is not only  the owner, but the chef. Pretty much everything he makes is from scratch. I had a seafood pasta dish that was full of flavor and sea food (scallops, shrimp, clams) and my wife had Lynn pear and cheese dish. Now when I saw pear i was hesitant,  but after I tried it , awesome, very delicious. Then Rudy came out again and told us about his Lemmoncello gelato, I typically don't eat lemon anything, but this dessert made me change my mind. He makes every part of this dessert from scratch. Everyone pretty much goes to a restaurant and never really orders dessert , but this one you must have.   Extras: So while we were there they told us about a free wine tasting in the beginning of the month. Now it's not extensive,  but they are good wines and you also get a discount on their bottles when you purchase for take home or dinner. We decided to take a group of friends and we had a blast. Even with a packed house Rudy managed to make his way to our table and have a conversation with us and we introduced him to futures guests at his place.   BOTTOM LINE: The ambiance is great, the views are awesome, the menu is perfect with options for everyone, the food amazing, and the best part is the owner had now become a friend. Anyone that takes that much pride in their restaurant I want to eat there. So the chances of me going back are preeeetttty high, like 100% high. People, try this place you won't be disappointed and when you go and Rudy comes out to talk to you tell him Zee sent you, the nursing student. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Place has the best Italian food.  I had the lenguni and clams and was perfect in every way.  Hubby had the lemon pasta scampi and it was to perfection. .. service is great. Must come and try"}
{"text":"Happy Mother's day!! Lunch here today we had the Chicken Parmesan it was excellent a must try nice portions and my hubby had the Meatball Hero sandwich very nice too... We will be back to try dinner next time."}
{"text":"Dining here is an experience.  The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly.  I think its great that they have the open kitchen.  It gives an experience to see the Chef cooking and then also come out to meet and greet the guests."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I've ever had. The owner and staff make you feel welcome. Overall one of the best places I've been to. Went with some friends and everything each person ordered was tasted by all, not a bad dish among them. Will be going back very soon for the eggplant."}
{"text":"What a strange experience for me. I believe there must have been a full moon out when dining here for the first time.   We arrived for a mid week dinner.  Our friends made a reservation but I think we would've been fine.  It's a very cute and quaint dining area. We were seated immediately and someone was right over to get our drink order.  Here is where it starts to get weird.  The gentlemen with the water pitcher leaned over the edge of the table to pour everybody's water glasses.  I thought it was strange to begin with but it continued even through our meal.  I think our husbands didn't appreciate the gentlemen's tie in their food while trying to refill water.  I hope he learns quickly to refill them from the sides of the longer tables.  Continuing on...  I had ordered a Caesar Salad to begin.  It was a very generous portion.  It could've been shared with the 4 of us at our table.  I didn't finish it because of the size but it was good.  For my entree I ordered the Carbonara Truffle Risotto.  As I began to eat my meal, the chef came around to our table.  He took one look at my risotto and was very displeased.  He took it back so he could remake it the correct way.  Strange? Yes and was probably the first time that has ever happened.  But I appreciated him wanting his food to be made and presented correctly.  It was indeed much better the second time around.    It was definitely an experience I won't forget too soon.  I am willing to try it again with hopes of the kinks all worked out."}
{"text":"So far this new local restaurant has been incredible! The meals we've had, the atmosphere and service pretty impressive for this quaint Italian restaurant located in the strip mall in the Black Mountain area of Henderson.   I got to admit when I first saw the sign for Il Chianti and peered into this restaurant, and saw the owner/chef was Filipino, I was a tad skeptical. Even after knowing he also was the exec chef at another local Italian restaurant.  All that went away though, from the first bite I had of a pesto dish and a pasta dish with clam sauce...omg..the flavors were poppin!!  Both Mr B and I are really particular of Italian cuisine and very few left good impressions. Next day I pleaded and dragged Mr B here.  It's a good thing other than seafood, Il Chianti offers, chicken, lamb and steak dishes.  Chicken Francese with a creamy lemon butter won hubby over, and Im addicted to the lamb chops with roasted figs on the anti pasti section.  There's a good selection of pasta to choose from as well as Chef Rudy's specialties. He also incorporated some Filipino food in there. The veggie lumpia/eggroll wrapped in lettuce with mint leaf and drizzled with a wasabi sauce is delicious! Even Mr B who does not eat vegetables, cleaned up that plate!  It's that good!! The flavors in all the dishes so far has been great!  Prices reasonable for lunch and a little higher for dinner, and can add up pretty quick if you are ordering appetitizers, soup, entree, alcoholic drinks and dessert. Worth it though!   The staff and service here rocks!!! And one reason that is the general manager here is none other than Rose who use to run Bernard's Bistro.   Hard to believe this restaurant used to house a fast/casual Mexican place...the transformation is 10x nicer looking.  Upscale feel with white linen on the tables, Frank Sinatra crooning in the background, just feels more classier than your average casual neighborhood joint.  There's also patio dining...with some very cool views of the Vegas Valley. Many people come up here to view fireworks, or tv reporters are seen here using the backdrop of the valley when they need a tv shot of the strip. I also recommend try out patio dining at the front tables during sunset. Some vino, delicious meal and tiramisu made in-house, you're all set!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on Mother's Day. The food was great -- I especially loved the veal piccata -- and the servers kept our water glasses full even though it was busier than usual. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The family checked this place out last night based on the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed! Chef Rudy has done a fantastic job of combining a great casual atmosphere with superb food and genuine service.   The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. We had a hard time trying to decide. The starters of Bruschetta and Calamari were perfect. All 4 entrees were amazing and the house made Cannoli finished things off.   It's very evident from Chef Rudy's interaction with guests that he loves what he does and is passionate; you're made to feel welcome as soon as you're seated.   This is an amazing restaurant with outstanding food. We will absolutely return for more!!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food.  The service is decent. Not sure about any happy hours specials. It is pricy for what you get.  It is a very nice location, right off the freeway."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The location is super accessible from the 95 and Horizon Ridge, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect...clean, throw back Italian, and relaxing. We ordered the chicken parmesan and the another dish that I can't remember the name of (it had vodka sauce, rock shrimp, mushrooms and asparagus)...both were delicious! The portions are generous, so we each had a box of leftovers at the end. The service was also great. Our waiter was very attentive, and the chef stopped by towards the end of our meal to check in and say hi. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were going out with friends and wanted to try a local restaurant that none of us had been to before. Il Chianti fit the bill. Ambiance: the restaurant is one of several eateries small nondescript strip mall just off the 515 freeway. The restaurant is fairly small and only minimally decorated. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights they have a piano player /singer. When we first got there, the restaurant was pretty packed. The combination of a crowded restaurant with a piano player / singer made it pretty noisy when we first got in. As the night went on the noise level went down and it was actually fairly enjoyable. Service: almost immediately after the hostess seated us, our server, Rose, was at our table to get our drink order. She was also very helpful in making menu choices. She was very friendly and welcoming. I especially like it when the owner or the chef work the room to make sure things are going well. Rudy, the owner and Chef, was in the dining room multiple times during the night talking to the guests and getting feedback. Overall, five star service. Food: photographs of the adobo mushrooms made it appear incredibly appetizing. We ordered them as a share item for the table. It did not disappoint!! An outstanding dish. For a main course I ordered the chicken Angelo. It is a huge portion of food with a couple of pounded chicken breasts, artichoke hearts, other veggies , in a light creamy sauce. Delicious. My wife had the chicken Vesuvio. Also a huge portion and quite delicious. You can bring your own wine for a corkage fee of $20. Value: excellent service, huge portions of very tasty food , an owner / chef who circulates throughout the restaurant during the dinner, live entertainment, all for about $25 a head. Now that's real value in a local restaurant. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Walked without reservations and glad it was slow or probably would've had a wait.. but they sat us right down and had bread and water at our table immediately. To have the chef come out and introduce himself and make you feel like royalty was awesome! The food, atmosphere, customer service was on for the books! Definitely plan to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Christmas Eve dinner without a lot of expectations, and was I pleasantly surprised! Amazing food, from appetizers, salad and entrees. As a former server in a high end Italian restaurant, I can be picky, but would not hesitate to recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The best Italian in town! We've only been twice now and each time we say we need to dine here more often. The food is outstanding, I really like the cheese tortellini with vodka sauce. We also tried the bread pudding with gelato, so amazing. The chef is awesome as well as all the staff."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful, we cant' wait to go back and try some other items on the menu.  The only thing we didn't care for was the tiramisu but the lemoncello ice cream was excellent."}
{"text":"Added a few new items on the menu and still great food and superb service. Monday-Thursday they have serve Pasta in a Cheese Wheel. Thursday-Saturday 6pm-9pm they have live music."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome ...the food are all delicious ..chef RUDY is very nice and he's very friendly...even the staff are gorgeous and good looking.....and everybody is welcome ......"}
{"text":"Friendly but forgetful wait staff. Olive Garden bread, not toasted through, came out first. Started with onion soup. Obviously broth was doing double duty...too thick, no onions, no French bread, just croutons. Ordered eggplant as my entree. Great portion, included pasta. Eggplant cut too thin so really couldn't taste it through the greasy breading. Wonderful Live music but placed too close to diners. Very busy Friday night. Might try again during the week."}
{"text":"My son has tennis in this area so we stopped for a late lunch.   Really excellent Italian food!   The portions are huge.   I ordered a half salmon sandwich and my son ordered a half meatball so we could share a side of pasta.  It was enough food to feed us that night as well : )   Great service."}
{"text":"Wife wanted something different.  Thought we would give it a try.  I am allergic to cheese... Italian restaurant... they accommodated me as if it wasn't an inconvenience at all.  All the staff helped each other as if it was normal (I think that here it is).  Chef came out a few times.  A great experience"}
{"text":"Beyond amazing.  I love their chicken parm, meatballs and their Alfredo is to die for.  They have a great staff that makes it feel very family oriented.   The atmosphere is welcoming and cozy.  If you want to indulge after the amazing meal- you must try the cannolis and tiramisu.  If I could give 10 stars I would !!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to/favorite spot when we feel like getting  EXCELLENT FOOD, EXCELLENT service, EXCELLENT VALUE and EXCELLENT AMBIANCE!! In the world of chain food, this place exceeds your expectations with the most mouth watering made-from scratch Italian food in the valley! And Rudy, the owner/chef makes you feel so special, as a customer, and a friend. He always comes out to the floor and let's you know that you are appreciated! All the ingredients are top shelf and you will NEVER be disappointed in the size of the dishes! EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious, and if you want something special, Rudy will whip up something irresistible!! The also have a wine- tasting cooking classes that a group can take! CANT WAIT TO EXPERIENCE THAT!!  Take my word, GO CHECK THIS AMAZING PLACE OUT!!!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a milestone birthday. First of all we were seated over 30 minutes past our reservation time. We had brought our own wine but it took repeated requests to get them to open a bottle and to bring wine glasses, not to mention that they broke the cork and half of it was still in the bottle. The server did not know how to fix this and had to bring it back to the kitchen.  He later turned up with 4 glasses of wine, poured in the kitchen!  He brought out the empty bottle and placed it on the table. When the dinner finally came they did not serve the ladies first .  The servers were very inexperienced and unprofessional .  We could see them eating through the kitchen window. When it was time for dessert and we asked what it was they were serving they did not know what the name was. Finally when the bill came we were grossly overcharged, being charged for infants in our party who did not eat anything. When trying to discuss this matter with the manager we were treated very disrespectfully, even being thrown the bill at the end.  The food was delicious and Chef Rudy was very charming; however it was disappointing that he was nowhere in sight when trying to rectify the bill at the end of our evening. Sadly to say the celebration ended with a very bad taste."}
{"text":"Delicious. Expensive but good. We've passed the strip mall so many times, and finally went in to dine. Glad we did. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Chef Rudy and his staff are super nice and welcoming. I ordered to go and felt like I was a regular even though it was only my first time there. I got the Lynn pear and cheese tortellini and it was amazing. I'm usually not a fan of sweet pastas but this was just the right balance of savory and sweet. The decor is very cozy and would be a great place for date night! I want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that the best Italian food in Vegas/Henderson was right down the road from me. Why it took me so long to get in here I do not know, all I know is I've been missing out on incredible food, perfect ambience, and the most friendliest Chef (Chef Rudy). We 1st had some very good bread that we nearly filled up on because it was that good. I was served the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had in my life. My daughter is a tiny little thing that never finishes anything, let's just say she didn't need a to go box for her Chicken Parm dish. My pasta finished off in a cheese wheel (that was so yummy). The Tiramisu was on point and they had Spumoni ice cream that my daughter loves. Overall we had great food, great service, and a fabulous Chef."}
{"text":"Great food reasonably priced. Italian food done right. Chef Rudy  and his crew are  most congenial."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Burned the pizza and $4 for a soda? Yikes. The chef did apologize for the pizza but I was literally the only one in the place."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while!  First off, the ambiance is nice. It's a small restaurant and when I went last Saturday they had live music for dinner that really set the tone. The small restaurant also provides a very community feel to it. People interact with one another, it's lively and friendly.  Service was great. Our waiter was great and gave us some great info regarding the specials and dishes. I'm 20 so I can't drink, I asked if they had anything like a Shirley temple, which they didn't, but what he basically recommended was a virgin sangria and it was great. I loved it. Basically it was sprite with sangria mix and fresh fruits.   My parents ordered sangrias as well (1 red and 1 white) that were apparently very good as well.  For appetizers, we tried both the calamari and the adobo mushrooms. Mushrooms were amazing, the sauce was amazing and had some dates in it that gave it a little sweetness. Calamari was good too, but the mushrooms were undoubtedly my favorite between the two.   For dinner, my mom and I split the special: prime rib with green beans and scalloped potatoes for 36$. They split it for us in the back and it was so much food. They brought the plate and my mom thought that's how it normally came until they put down my plate. It was really yummy, prime rib was tender and cooked well, greenbeans had lots of garlic.  My dad ordered the adobo nation which was super yummy as well with lots of chicken and porkbelly and my little sister had the fettuccini alfredo and a bowl of clam chowder.  Chef Rudy also came by to talk to us, which was so nice. Apparently they do cheese wheel pasta on Wednesdays and Thursdays which I have to try sometime. Being from the Philippines, he and my parents were talking about where they're from and the influence in his food.  Also, definitely get the dessert. We had the limoncello (lemon gelato on a fried wonton) and the lava cake. Both were amazing, the lava cake was the best I've ever had, rich and creamy. The limoncello was refreshing and just perfect.  We'll definitely be back!  PS: the bread is amazing too, kinda reminded me of pan de sal."}
{"text":"So far the service has been odd, as several people are helping us. In spite of this, everything has taken a while. I ordered chicken parmigiana and my daughter had linguine with seafood. Mine was ok. It is heavy on the garlic and the meat is super heavily breaded. The truffle oil on the linguine is a tad heavy and truffle isn't something to truffle with. I'd probably give this a half hearted recommend at this point. I remain open minded though that it might deserve more depending on what is ordered."}
{"text":"A gem away from the strip! Chef Rudy will make you a meal you won't forget. I had the seafood pan roast tonight with risotto and it is now my favorite dish. The service is top notch like the food. I am sure you will find your favorite as well."}
{"text":"came to here from looking on google. So glad I decided to come here. The owner and chef came out spoke with us as if he already knew us. Made us feel at home. The food was AMAZING. recommend this place 10000 percent"}
{"text":"We love this place and go often. The food is phenomenal. Every dish we've ever tried has been delicious. The atmosphere is great and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This is place EXCEPTIONAL because it fits all kinds groups and everyone feels comfortable in Chianti. I was here with a few friends of mine who visited just a few weeks ago, and we all wanted Italian for dinner. It was my first time then, and I truly enjoyed the ambiance, the food, and the price. It was also great to see Chef Rudy entertaining other diners, so we knew we were in the right place and felt like family. This is the most Italian you can go if ever you're in Henderson, to be honest. It's a great place to bring in friends who are visiting the city."}
{"text":"This place is one of the finest examples of how a restaurant experience should be like. Food is awesome.  Chef Rudy, Rose and the staff break their backs with a smile to provide a family, let me get to know your name experience.   Have been here three times and counting and will keep referring friends clients and family.  The food is delicious and atmosphere perfect. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Chef Rudy is amazing!  The favors of the dishes are incredible and the portions are so large.  You will be enjoying the favors the next day. Chicken Angelo is excellent and rib eye special was spectacular. Try the lemon cello ice cream None better!  Service is warm friendly and accommodating.  We will be back many times."}
{"text":"The Best fine dining we've been to. Every time we go to Vegas for a special occasion we always stop by to this place. I love their Filipino-Italian inspired dishes. The best!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  What a great meal, great service and great live music.  Chef Rudy was very engaging and friendly.  Our server Carolyn was very kind and helpful on what choose for our dinner.  Calvin was on point with his renditions of Nat King Cole and Louis Armstrong and played some smooth jazz guitar.  And the food...some of the best Italian we (my wife and I) have had in a while.  Another gem of a place and so close to the house.  I'm a believer.  The reviews were right.  This place is yet another hidden gem that I look forward to coming back to again and again.  Thank you all for making this a pleasurable experience after a long week at work."}
{"text":"I just randomly found and decided to try Il Chianti one evening and...WOW...what a great surprise!  Chef Rudy offers up some of the best Italian dishes I've had the pleasure of trying (4 dishes and counting).  This place is literally a hidden jewel, with an unassuming exterior in a small strip mall.  I've always found that when the chef is the owner...be prepared for an outstanding meal.  This is most certainly true here.  Great ingredients, interesting menu with a good variety of dishes...and...the hot fresh bread...to die for."}
{"text":"Great food.  Fun atmosphere. Chef came out to say hi and check on everything.  Food was fresh, beautiful, and delicious.  Anti pasta and seafood were great. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Best calamari that I've been had!. The Lobster Bisque was very tasty. I will definitely make the drive to enjoy IL Chianti again :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service, very friendly. Owner/chef comes to the tables and greets the diners. Food is very well prepared. Would come back again. Had the lamb appetizer. Best I've ever eaten. Served with dates and a mild wasabi"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the staff, chef/owner, everyone here are all amazing! The food is truly amazing. When we want Italian it's always our #1 go to."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 on our first time visit. This is a fantastic Italian restaurant. The service was outstanding and the food was phenomenal. My compliments to the chef. Very well priced and the portions are Huge. If you're looking for an inexpensive meal with the quality of fine dining restaurant come to this restaurant and enjoy."}
{"text":"This is more of a 4 1/2 star review, but I love local restaurants....and all around, we had a very satisfying dinner experience so I bumped it up.  First thing I noticed was the ambiance. Dimmed lighting with Sinatra music playing in the background.....gives me that whole Chicago/New York vibe. We told our waiter this was our first time here and he gave us a quick run of the menu, specials of the day and some of their popular items.   I ordered the beef and cheese tortellini and my boyfriend got the veal vesuvio. We both were highly pleased with our entrees. Food came out pippin hot and portions were plentiful. Enough for leftovers too. We will definitely be returning...there were other entrees I wanted to try...like the Chicken Parm or the Carbonara Della Nonna.  FYI, restaurant is closed Mondays so plan accordingly. Smaller sized restaurant so you may have to make a reservation if you're planning to come with a big party."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner. Friendly staff, awesome chef, delicious food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant. The bread and lamb chops appetizer were the standouts. They put a little too much dressing on salads. Both the Caesar and spinach salad were tasty. Had the pasta with garlic cream sauce with prosciutto which was too salty for me. My friend has the veal which she enjoyed. Would go back and get 2 of the lamb appetizer as a meal! Don't have any pics as I was too hungry and forgot. Service was also great, Carlo was nice."}
{"text":"OMG what a hidden gem!!!! we stumbled upon Chianti on our way to Green Valley Ranch.  Were greeted warmly by the server and she also made some suggestions for us.  We had the Barrata cheese with balsamic vinegar.  TBH we just had fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and basil literally the night before so I was hesitant to order it.  BOY WAS I GLAD I DID! the flavors were so good that we devoured it! Together we shared the Chicken Marsala and the Spicy Seafood Pasta.  Both had some excellent flavors and most importantly.. the pasta was cooked to a perfect authente texture! The server also told us they have live music on the weekends!  will most definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"We came here for a nice family dinner since we knew chef Rudy from Ventanos. We got the antipast that was absolutely amazing, the breadsticks are fantastic and all the entrees we had were delicious. The staff and hospitality was very nice as well. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I hate to complain but im not sure how they collected 5 stars from so many guests. Our spaghetti was average, nothing special. The risotto was not good; rice was tough, not creamy as risotto should be and the \"crispy pancetta\" was more like tough chicken. Added to that, our repeated request for water refill went unheeded until dinner was over and a complaint of same was made. I love to dine out but I'm not a fan here. Too bad...attractive restaurant and lovely music from guitarist."}
{"text":"It's really good! I had a craving for veal, and it exceeded my expectations! I forsee us becoming regulars. Thanks for bringing a quality establishment to this neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas for over 50 years. Nice restaurant and wonderful service. My food reminded me of Italian restaurants in New York City. Everything from the breadsticks to the pasta is fresh made. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the city right now for many reasons. Truly authentic Italian food, which you certainly don't get most places. Service is very personable and attentive. The prices are reasonable and Chef Rudy is like none other. He's the owner/chef, is there every day they're open, and comes through the dining room at various times, sits with the customers, talks and enjoys himself. He also does very unique things with the food he learned in Italy through the years. What else could you really ask for in a restaurant?  Definite \"locals\" feel. This is a place for a foodie."}
{"text":"Il Chianti is a mom-and-pop type of feel Italian restaurant in the heart of the suburbs.  It's very personable and feels like you are going to a friend's house for dinner.  The food is good and all the dishes were good.  Portion size was also generous.  The most amazing was the homemade lemon gelato.  Worth checking it out just for that.  Will continue to stop by!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday because we wanted to try the cheese wheel pasta. We didn't know that the cheese wheel pasta was only on certain days of the week, and of course my birthday fell on NOT one of those days. But the chef came out and made our pasta in the cheese wheel anyway! Which was completely unnecessary, but absolutely wonderful! Rose has provided amazing service and we will definitely be back! The food, atmosphere, and the Moscato wine are amazing. :) 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was amazing, especially the Zuppa Di Vongole Pier 13 clam chowder soup! I loved the calamari and the egg rolls too. And the cannoli?? Wow.. The servers are nice and prompt, and the owner Rudy is awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night. We had heard great things and wanted to try it out. We love Ventano's and I heard the former chef opened this place up! I just finished my leftovers for lunch and had to sing its praises!! I had the Lynn Pear tortellini with rock shrimp. Fabulous!! Seriously, one of the best Italian dishes I've had in a long time. Homemade tortellini, yum. Slightly sweet kicked with a mild cheese makes for a smooth delicious dish. Shrimp was a nice flavor added and it had yummy cheeses and spinach in a vodka sauce. I highly recommend this dish!"}
{"text":"What an incredible experience at Il Chianti! The hospitality was absolutely perfect by Chef Rudy and Rose.  Genuine, kind hearted people.  The Lobster Ravioli and Cioppino were delicious.   Live music on Thursday through Sunday nights which added to the ambiance.  We will be back again real soon!"}
{"text":"All the 5 star reviews made this place the perfect choice for my dad's birthday dinner celebration.  We were disappointed.  The caprese salad had huge amounts of raw red onion which were too spicy, hardly any tomato or basil and the burrata cheese was ICE cold (ruining the opportunity for it to melt in the mouth. ;(((  My mom ordered the Mediterranean per the server and I was shocked to discover that for $25 (which is expensive for a pasta dish) you get teeny tiny mini shrimp and teeny bay scallops, and very few of each.  It was mainly pasta, not homemade and not what I would consider high end.  Dad got the lobster ravioli, he said he could not taste the lobster and the shrimp on top were average.  He said not something he would come back for.  My eggplant parmiagiana was the big winner.  I loved the texture and overall flavor, and since that is a tough dish to get right, this is what earned the 3 stars.  That and the fresh bread sticks which my mom loved. The service was left to be desired.  It took forever to get water to the table.  After our food came out no one came by to offer fresh grated parmiagiana.  We stared at our plates for a while waiting,  Finally after 3- 4 minutes we had to flag someone down, and that was a challenge.  The place was 10% full so it was a surprise they could not provide better service.  I asked them to bring out cheesecake as a surpise for my dad's birthday. Our server came out with a piece of cake, a lighter in hand and just puts it down in front of my dad.  Then she starts talking about something...who knows what.  The candle was not even lit!  I just stared at her like - are you kidding me?  Light the damn candle and lets sing!  We all left full with a good amount of leftovers but not even close to a 4 star dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!  The staff especially ROSE and Rudy the owner made us feel like family. I highly recommend this restaurant. If you're in the area and craving awesome Italian food come on out and meet Rose, Rudy and the rest of their awesome staff. You won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an early New Years Eve dinner with my family, including small grandkids, and was completely satisfied with the food & service. Chef Rudy was ever-present to make sure his guests were being attended to & server, Rose, was a complete delight! We especially enjoyed the entertainment- a perfect complement to a great evening. We were made to feel very welcome & appreciated - we will definitely be back and will gladly recommend."}
{"text":"I picked this spot because I wanted an authentic Italian food. I made a good choice...The people and service also were out of this world!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. The food is so darn flavorful. And the chef...the chef loves to cook and is very friendly. This is our Italian go-to spot!"}
{"text":"5 stars all around! Wonderful service, cozy atmosphere, and fantastic food. Definitely a hidden gem in this part of Henderson. We ordered calamari, pear & cheese, and the lasagna and each one was equally delicious. There was also live entertainment (who was awesome) and the owner made it a point to stop by each table and say hello. So glad we chose Il Chianti for date night!"}
{"text":"WOW!  We have needed a nice restaurant in this area for a long time.  I've been there for lunch and dinner.  Service was great both times.  Chef Rudy comes out and stops by the tables.  The atmosphere is very nice, very clean, and comfortable. The chicken parm was delicious and an ample portion!   The seafood pan roast was tasty.  Salad was large enough to share before our entree. There was live music on a Friday evening which was very pleasant."}
{"text":"There is a new restaurant in town.  Great Italian fusion fare and great wait staff.  Can't wait to try the entire menu ... Lunch and dinner.   Jan T."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service. The chef came out and talked with every table, he was very personable.  We order pear tortellini which was superb, as well as the lamb chop appetizer. We would go again."}
{"text":"I've known Rudy for a long time, he was my basketball coach growing up. My family and I have followed him to ventanos where he used to be head chef but now he has his own place which is outstanding. The food is best in Henderson and even Vegas hands down. He comes out and talks to every table making you feel at home and you can tell the food is made with love n care. When ever I have family coming in from New York, this is one of the places I take them to."}
{"text":"By far the best French Onion soup ever!   Just had the 1/2 meatball sub and French Onion soup for lunch today.  Super stoked that Chef Rudy opened Chianti Italian right down the street from my real estate office Nevada Desert Realty."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation, it was early so they did seat us last night, in no time it was packed, chef made his rounds and then some, very at home like  atmoshpere a pleasure will be back again and again"}
{"text":"First impressions are key when it comes to any business, especially when you get a personal invitation from the Chef of an Italian restaurant.¬† Most times it starts with an introduction, in promoting it's a face, or in marketing it may be and ad with photos.¬† At Il Chianti it was a succession of all; and a very well made first impression plus inspirations.  Chef Rudy's invitation arrived three weeks prior to our visit.¬† In the days leading to our first dining experience here, a good friend had been raving about dishes and desserts.¬† Finally a plan to dine here was put forth.¬† We met Chef Rudy.¬† Dang whatta guy!¬† He's so personable, made us crack up, sat at our table and chatted up.¬† Diners were coming and going and you can just see with the interpersonal engagements that he's an appreciated human being.¬† Really awesome to meet you Chef!¬† Thank you for having us and for your crave-a-licious food!  Gratitude as well to our servers and introducing MacMurray Ranch Pinot.  Dinnertime meet up was 7pm on a perfect autumn evening, where the view from outside seating is the after sunset glow blanketing the horizon, and the city lights are awake.¬† Such a sight!¬† The location is perfect.  Add to that some red wine and antipasti, you're on a roll to a well spent evening.¬† Beef Carpaccio with burruta cheese...first timer.¬† How interesting is the way the meat covers the plate like one sheet, then peels off like soft butter.¬† I like this appetizer, together with the garlic bread sticks served with infused olive oil.¬† Great for sharing!  Dinner plates: Chef Rudy's Adobo Nation, Lynn Pear & Cheese Tortellini, and Risotto con Funghi.¬† Heavy? Yes.¬† But delicious?¬† Ultimate YES!¬† We believe it cuz we've tasted it... the unique fusion and pairing, with flavor knock outs!¬† It's different and savor worthy.¬†   I had the Lynn Pear & Cheese Tortellini in tomato vodka sauce.¬† This dish with all the playful flavors woohooo went surprisingly well together.¬† I ordered it for the pears, cuz it's not a usual pasta dish I'd point out.¬† Actually it's not a dish I've seen anywhere else at all.¬† I got more than just a curious satisfaction.¬† Tastes really delicious!¬† If you order this, try to consume it while it's still hot.¬† Of course having a conversation with laughs and sentimentality during dinnertime may cause difficulty to keep food hot while conversing.  Desserts: creme brulee, tiramisu, limoncello ice cream.¬† They're all to cry over for more.¬† But I beg you please DO NOT MISS OUT on the limoncello ice cream.¬† Perhaps you've never been here before and you're so undecided with all the wonderful menu choices.¬† Let me help you... Start out with the limoncello ice cream.¬† Sure why not?!¬† I'm all for dessert first!¬† May you dream of the limoncello ice cream... Hear it beckon you...  Chef, twas an honor!¬† You're an inspiration, a good influence, a supporter, a positive presence in the community.¬† Thanks so much for the tip on cooking classes, Cooking With Papa.¬† Sounds like a fun idea for a birthday gig!¬† We shall see ya' again especially for the... c'mon everyone LIMONCELLO ICE CREAM!!!¬† Good job high ten high ten :D"}
{"text":"WOW!! This place has the most unbelievable food! If anyone goes to this place and doesn't like it is jealous they can't cook this awesome!! My wife and I ate everything, the desserts are the most delicious! A must for your bucket list, go as soon as possible so you won't be asking yourself why didn't I try this place sooner!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It is close to our home. Delicious Italian food with some dishes that pay homage to some Filipino Fare. The Italian Flavors capture the essence of Italy with rich sauces and pasta cooked perfectly. The seafood is fresh fresh fresh! Le Especialita eran Molto deliciozo. The pasta mediterranea is my favorite."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. Excellent Italian food in a very nice atmosphere that you would not expect in a strip mall. Entertainment Thursday-Saturday. We asked about this since we would definitely go back to be entertained by the gentleman playing guitar and singing Sinatra era tunes. We had the lasagna and veal parm. Both above average. The menu has so many favorites, we'll probably try something else next time. Great bread sticks!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner two weeks ago. and our meals were amazing. Atmosphere was nice except for the loud sales lady at another table trying to sell the owner products. It was a mood spoiler and they should have scheduled a better time when restaurant is closed or not during a meal time.  Especially when our meal for the two of us was over $100. Will return in future, and hope the atmosphere is more romantic, like other Italian restaurants we have frequented in Henderson."}
{"text":"Very personalized service warm atmosphere Chef Rudy is the best and he personally greets his diners, his staff is on point, you will feel very comfortable, like part of Il Chianti family. My personal favorite Specialita' Della Puglia and the lemon cello dessert to die for."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful surprise when we ate at  Il Chianti  delivered delicious and everyone was so friendly.  We just randomly stopped in.  It was superb"}
{"text":"No matter what I write you won't realize how great this restaurant is until you come and eat here. Look my amazing dinner:)"}
{"text":"Chef Rudy welcomed us seated us at our table.  The first service was very slow outta the gate and first server, a young lady never brought my iced tea. It took a long time for the next server to take our order and the garlic rolls to come. Once we were served our salads the service improved immensely and the entrees were delicious. We had chicken scallopini and chicken parmesan.  Chef Rudy came by twice to check on us."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. Rose was very attentive. And they even make pasta in a big cheese wheel! Nice local restaurant and not too expensive."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and food was great. The chef came out to greet us and the other patrons while we were there. They did have an issue with the A/C, but hopefully it has been fixed. It probably would have been even more enjoyable. Either way we will be going back for another visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Have only enjoyed 6 items so far and am looking forward to experiencing several more. Ambiance, staff, live music from Calvin (left handing his guitar while belowing the blues) and the tastiest offering from chef Rudy. Thank you and thanks to your passion for what you do."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The atmosphere is great and the food even better. Chef Rudy comes out to greet us every time we come and is sooo nice always feel like your having dinner with the family. Every thing I've had here is killer!!! Every thing is made from scratch and I would pay for the free bread sticks they bring you they are the best I've had! You have to come here and bring your family so they can meet Rudy too!!"}
{"text":"The rumors are true this place is REALLY good! Perfect way to end the night. Everything was super tasty. Our favorites were the baby lamb chops and the fettuccine mediterr√°nea but everything else was perfectly wonderful including our chat with the chef and our server Gilbert!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had the chicken piccata which she said was one of the best piccatas she's ever had (this is a huge compliment. She is quite the foodie)  I had the Lynn pear and cheese tortellini with rock shrimp. I too found this very delicious. Nice and cheesy with a delightful sweetness.  We also ordered bruschetta, a kids entree, tiramisu and cannoli. Total bill was $90, a bit more than I expected given Yelp listed it as $$. I think $$$ would be more accurate. But the food was amazing and definitely worth the price.  This was our first visit, which we took as a carry out order after a hard weekend of housework. But we discovered the inside would make for a great date night and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Omg! The Food is so good! This is why I love Italian food. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend. The chicken Florentine is to die for lol, paired with a nice glass of wine you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm blown away with this Italian restaurant and love everything from the simplicity of this restaurant to the friendly staff and exceptional food. Chef Rudy is friendly and very accommodating!!! It's a must try and I promise you the food and friendly staff will not disappoint you! AWESOME FOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"From the service to the amazing Risotto this place is a must try. Such an amazingly friendly staff out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Oh they have these amazing appetizer lamb chops with a wasabi dipping sauce! Great! My daughter and I come here specifically for them"}
{"text":"My wife and I wandered into here by accident. The staff was very friendly, and the food was amazing. Everything was cooked fresh (not frozen) and cooked to perfection. The tiramisu was to die for."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with my husband.  The food & service were both wonderful. The bruschetta was REALLY good. The Caesar salad was very good as well. I prefer when salads are served on chilled plates though. My chicken francese was very tasty & my husband LOVED his lamb chops. The chef visted our table & made food suggestions, which was a very nice personal touch. The embionce was very lovely, with music in the background. It seemed ro be playing from a radio station however, so there were a few commercials. Maybe a CD or mp3 player would be a better choice. I will definitely go back here without a doubt. The prices were decent as well. We skipped dessert because we were too full!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this quaint little place was in December during the Holiday shopping madness on our way home from the Galleria. 1st,the Service was great. The owner came by to welcome us- very nice!  They gave us garlic bread sticks, they were ok - possible they were not homemade??  We ordered a coke $4- ouch! Linguini Carbonara $21  Chicken Parmesan $24  Honestly, the food was so hot, we had to let it cool down before we could eat. I had a few bites but burned my tongue and couldn't eat any more. We took it to go.  The chicken reheated well,  a bit too much garlic but that's OK.  The carbonara had way too much oil/butter & i didn't really enjoy it.  I think we will try it one more time. There were some enticing dishes listed on the menu...  Won't be bringing the kids with these prices though. I hope they do well, it's a nice place.  PS- they also had a man in the corner playing some music. He never smiled.  Cheesey old school touch but really pleasant to hear."}
{"text":"Very delicious food! Chef Rudy was very accommodating and personable! Will definitely be dinning here again!"}
{"text":"Truly great & personable service! I would suggest trying the pear ravioli, a wonderful combination of sweet and savory. Outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious. The owner and Chef Rudy came out to greet us and tell us his specials, what he could cook up for us- you can tell he really cares about his patrons. The food was incredible! Fresh everything, he's been in the food business for over 35 years and you can tell! Don't pass this amazing restaurant, it hits the spot! YUM!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, home-made dishes that leave your palate overwhelmed and wanting more. DELICIOUS food, great ambiance and servicre... definitely worth checking out if you like Italian food.. Kudos Chef Rudy!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure, great food and the best staff. Rudy makes you feel like you are at home."}
{"text":"The service was so bad here that I am truly shocked. We came on a Saturday, they didn't give my mom her food until we were all done eating and my husband was brought the completely wrong meal. We were here for over an hour before the food arrived. It was very good- the eggplant a little salty, but the breadsticks were good. If you do come, make sure it isn't Friday or Saturday- I'm pretty sure everyone had horrible service."}
{"text":"This place is now our go to Italian restaurant! The meals were flat out delicious! We ordered the Adobo Nation, Carbonara truffle risotto and a New York steak with shrimp linguine. The service was fantastic and the Chef was very friendly! We had dinner on a Saturday night and they had a wonderful singer who sang some great oldies. This is certainly a hidden gem that we're real happy to have found."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Had a fabulous time on a Thursday night. Live entertainment (Calvin) was so good and so much fun. Rose is the hostess with the mostest. The food was amazing and the chef came out to make sure all was well which was a nice touch. Had a fabulous time and will definitely revisit the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"A former colleague from New York was in town for one day with a group of Rotary exchange students and we planned to meet for lunch or dinner.  As it turned out, dinner was the better option so I started checking on Yelp for places in Henderson where the group was spending the night.  Il Chianti jumped out for its good reviews and I bookmarked the restaurant and I'm so glad I did.  I met my friend where the group was staying on Boulder Highway and Il Chianti was a mere mile and a half away.  Il Chianti is in a non-descript small strip mall that I've driven by many times on the freeway but never on the Horizon Ridge side.  We arrived close to eight and were seated promptly.  While looking at the menu, the chef/owner came by to welcome us to this small restaurant that was dimly lit.    We were told two specials and then we both ordered the lobster ravioli with blackened shrimp, asparagus, in a tomato vodka sauce.  The shrimp were very good.  Some of the lobster flavor was overwhelmed by the sauce but the ravioli were good.  My friend isn't a fan of asparagus and there was no problem substituting a different vegetable for her.  For dessert, we shared an order of cannoli.  I asked our server if they were pre-filled or filled to order and she said they were filled to order.  They were very good.  Service was very good, the staff was very nice, and it turned out to be a good choice for dinner.  Yelp comes through yet again."}
{"text":"I don't know what drew us to this place but from the moment we walked in we were greeted by the most inspiring man who happened to be the owner who happened to be the infamous Rudy Janeo Jr (google him) I just told him what I liked he brought me the most unbelievable dish I've had, sat down and broke bread with me and my family, shared his story and made us some off the menu food that was out of this world! I will most definitely be coming back to this gem as well as to visit my new buddy Mr Chef Rudy! This place is a one of a kind experience"}
{"text":"Clam chowder - very flavorful and not high on sodium as other places. Linguine Alla Vongole - very good also.  Overall, better than a lot of places and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and am thrilled to have Chef Rudy and Rose (the most amazing hostess) in our area. Great great great food   Go soon and I know you will  thank me while your mouth is full of their delicious meals. Tell them Linda sent you"}
{"text":"Im so glad we found this restaurant. The wait staff was excellent. The chef was personable and interactive with us and even stopped by our table to ask how we liked the French Onion soup. Which by the way is quite possibly the best French Onion Soup i have ever had.  We had lumpia for appetizer. I loved that not everything on the menu was Italian. There are bits of Filipino flare thrown in. The pasta was fantastic! The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. The service is great. You feel very welcome and you don't feel rushed.  The food is five star.  I am looking forward to dining here again soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. What a hidden gem. Definately recommended. The food was incredible and the service was great. From the minute we walked in the door, we felt welcomed. Thank you I'm chianti"}
{"text":"Yes this the place that I have heard so much about, the personality of the restaurant goes with the personality of the owner / Chef Rudy. The lunch that I had was the magnificent lunch wrap. Tasty unique and right on. The cost was right as well. I will be back with more friends for dinner this time. Well done Rudy"}
{"text":"Last month my business trip took me back to Las Vegas. I drove to Henderson where I normally stay, and stopped to grab a small bite. I usually take back routes because I enjoy the scenery. Driving on West Horizon Ridge Parkway, this illuminated new sign, caught my attention. The sign read, \"Il Chianti Italian Restaurant\" (pronounced \"Kee Auntie\"). I decided to check it out although dressed in sweats. Once inside I thought to myself, \"oh no, this is a white table cloth place and I'm in sweats.\" I felt out of place; but not for long since the hostess immediately made me feel at ease.   While looking over the menu, I could smell the aroma. I observed my surroundings and saw so many happy expressions, and delighted faces. A few minutes went by, and was shocked when the Owner/Chef Rudy, came over and introduced himself. This friendly gentleman welcome me with a great smile. To me, that told me, he was very involved in his restaurant, and noticed new patrons.   Ultimately, I decided on the Insalata Classica and Lobster Bisque. I wasn't too hungry to begin with, but the aroma lured me in. When I took several mouthfuls of the salad, I was blown away with the variety of different flavors and spices. The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Those caramelized walnuts were mouthwatering. What really blew me away was the Italian Garlic Salad Dressing. This sent me to Heaven and back. \"Wow\"!! No words to explain.   Several minutes later, the Lobster Bisque arrived. I began the journey of consumption of \"MY\" Lobster Bisque. That first spoon \"sent me into orbit\"!! I honestly was taken to another planet, passed Pluto, than landed in Tuscany as my final destination. Cannot say enough of how delicious it was. Finally, stuffed and content, I motioned for the waiter to call the chef again so I can give him my compliments and kiss the ground he walked on. The waiter smiled and laughed. Unfortunately, I was too full to eat the rest of my amazing salad, \"I so loved.\" I took it to go and promised to return on Monday. The chef informed me that Monday was the only day they were closed. I plan on going back solely for the eating experience, on an empty stomach and to enjoy the rest of that phenomenal menu. A very happy customer, Yasmin Steinke"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant through random search while in town from Seattle. Extremely glad we did. Food was excellent. Service top notch. Definitely recommend for dinner."}
{"text":"This was disgusting. I had the calamari and spaghetti with meat sauce. The calamari was way over breaded you couldn't find the meat and when you did it was super chewy and no flavor not even salt or pepper. The meat sauce spaghetti had a terrible smell and tasted horrible like sweaty old cow. Gross! I only ate the breadsticks because I was starving but even those were plain and maybe frozen before. The worst was when I went in the restaurant no one was there. Should've been a sign I guess. The host waiter charged me $27 bucks for the crap and when I called to complain about taste they hung up on me. To top it all off I had my 18mo old baby on my hip and my 2 week old in his car seat hands full....she handed me the bag and said \"here you go\" I had to get the door myself and juggle it all to my car wondering what's that nasty smell I just paid $27 bucks for? Hoping it was good when I got home. Well it was not good. I'd give it No stars if I could."}
{"text":"There are a handful of up-scale restaurants in the local strip shopping centers; one becomes used to burgers or sandwiches.   But this is among the few that have food, a more-than-average wine list, and that blessedly quiet atmosphere that soothes (and yes, sometimes live entertainment! ), for a couples dinner or a peaceful dinner for any number to enjoy.   Chef Rudy is personable and the staff is quietly attentive.  I would compare this experience to Sonoma Cellar or Fuego, without the parking a mile away or the noisy casino to trek through.   And no waiting.     Definitely worth a first visit.  Chef Rudy remembers you when you become a regular.  Trust me, you will."}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant that delivers excellent quality food and service. Rose is a serving staff there and she is Fantastic."}
{"text":"Appetizers were so yummy, cant  wait to try full menu!! Loved  the mushroom appetizer,meatballs and clam chowder soooo good!"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Henderson HANDS DOWN! The entire staff is super friendly and accommodating. The food is just to die for!! We feel like part of the family every time we dine at this place! The chef comes to check in EVERY TIME to make sure things are up to par. Only one complaint, PLEASE BRING BACK THE MOTHERS DAY CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH CAPPUCCINO GELATO. Oh my goodness, that was the best chocolate cake I've ever had.   Seriously, you have to stop in and get some authentic Italian food. This is the real deal!!"}
{"text":"I've dined here twice because I couldn't make up my mind about how to review them after the first visit alone. Overall, I think Il Chianti is a good option for Italian food in the area.  The restaurant is easy to access, located in a parking lot with plenty of parking. The dining area is clean and has a nice ambiance.   The menu has a wide variety of options with different protein dishes, pastas, salads, and risottos. On my first visit I had the Chicken Vesuvio which I enjoyed. There was a nice portion of chicken and pasta. The sauce and toppings were good too. My husband had Veal Parmesan and thought it was good. For dessert we shared the Lemoncello Gelato that chef recommended. I thought it was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again.   On second visit I had the Seafood Pan Roast which had a variety of seafood in a pink sauce with asparagus risotto. I didn't love this dish. The pink sauce was tasty, but I didn't think the sauce paired well with the salmon. The risotto was well prepared, but not very flavorful. My husband's Gnocchi Con Vodka was very good and well prepared.   The best part of this restaurant is Chef Rudy. I love that he comes out to the dining room and talks to all of his guests. It's great to see someone so passionate about their business and that seems to genuinely enjoy interacting with their customers."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been here a few times for special events.  The food is always terrific!  Chef Rudy is one of the best kept secrets in town - his restaurant has been around for about a year.  He start a new lunch menu - I had the adobe nation burger- best burger in town - looking forward to trying his ramen burger.  Make sure you say hi to Chef Rudy - always will make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Food is great,  service is top notch. Prices are a little out of touch for location but you get quality and the servings are pretty hearty."}
{"text":"Delicious food and lots of it we should've split our meal but we didn't  plenty of it for the next day I will eat there again next time I'm in Henderson"}
{"text":"OMG SO good!! I can't wait to go back!! Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing (I had the eggplant)....This was one of my favorite culinary experience of my life! We didn't leave anything in our plate!!! Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man! This place was brilliant! I loved everything from the experience to the food, it was worth every penny.  I came here for lunch with my grandma around 12:30 and there were a few other tables seated, but not many people in general. Our server gave us a table and promptly got our drinks started. We ordered bruschetta instead of getting a bread basket and it was outstanding! Seriously. I could have eaten all the bruschettas as my lunch haha, but I digress. The bread was crispy and sturdy enough to hold up the small mountain of tomatoes and cheese and vinaigrette sauce of heaven. Very delicious, a must. For my meal I ordered the penna la donna or something like that (I know, sorry) with a side of clam chowder. The clam chowder came out literally boiling and bubbling so that was interesting but once it cooled down below scorching it was fantastic. My grandma said it was just good, in comparison to everything else, but I liked it. My food came out and my lord was it huge and delectable! The waitress grated some fresh parmesan over the noodles, which were coated in a rich buttery garlic sauce with bits of meat (rasher? balogna? delicious!) and peas. It was super tasty but definitely filling. I felt like the portion was enough for 2-3 people so I only made a small dent in the dish before getting it boxed to go. We then ordered two cannoli, which were by all means ridiculously sweet in all the right ways, but it was too late. My grandma and I were stuffed so we could only eat half of one cannoli and we got the rest of our stuff to go. I guess I should mention, my grandma got the meatball sandwich with a side of fries and she said she had never had meatballs better than the ones in her sandwich. To say the least, she was pleased, as was I! The chef came by towards the end of the meal to say hi and check in, and inform of us weekend brunch with champagne. While it was a little pricey, it was 110% worth it! The servers and all employees we talked with were super friendly, welcoming and efficient. The food was off the wall good and the place is decorated very elegantly and had a relaxed but upscale atmosphere. If you are still reading reviews, stop and go get a table and eat away! :)"}
{"text":"This place deserves PERFECT RATING! Start with the warm fresh bread that is delicious, then the pasta: we got the Creamy Carbonara and the Cheese tortellini and we could not stop eating! We wanted to try the desserts but the portions are so big and tasty that we had no room. We plan to come back and explore more items from the menu. Finally their service was stupendous!"}
{"text":"I hate to bash a small business, but our dinner was thoroughly disappointing.  First off, the beer that I was served had gone bad and I had to replace it with a mainstream \"water beer\" to ensure it wasn't old.   Our bruschetta had so much fresh minced garlic that it rendered it nearly inedible.  I managed to choke down one piece.  The lobster bisque, which is devoid of actual lobster, tasted downright fishy.  Not briny, mind you, fishy.  We both tried two bites to confirm my initial impression, and sat it to the side uneaten.  Lastly, the pear ravioli arrived.  While I'll admit the sauce was pretty good, the shrimp that were part of the dish were beyond disappointing.  They are most definitely of the frozen variety, from a bag.  At $28 (including the $5 share charge), I don't feel that the dish provides enough quality ingredients to justify the price.    We truly wanted to enjoy our meal, and only chose this place so that we could support local small businesses.  I'm giving an extra star for the friendly service.  However, based on this experience we definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"Best tasting Italian food I have ever had.   We went to celebrate our anniversary & chef Rudy came to our table with free appetizers & sat & chatted with us!! Such a great guy Rose, our server was so very polite & attentive to every need! She gave us wine recommendations & explained each dish & I absolutely love the fact that she came to our table to let us decide when the entree should start cooking, we were not in a hurry & we wanted to enjoy our appetizers & take our time! What amazing attention to detail!  The appetizers ( bruschetta) were perfectly done, &  had just a hint of spice which made it over the top perfect! The fresh bread & balsamic vinegar dipping oils were the best we ever tasted. That balsamic must of been aged 100 years, so smooth! The main course had such fresh explosions of flavor. I had the eggplant siciliano & it was nice & hot & cooked to perfection with just enough cheese & sauce...we are looking forward to going back again & again!"}
{"text":"What a Jewel of a place to eat the food is to die for.  Best calamari. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. The Chef came out to see how we liked our meal. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Restaurant is amazing!!!  Food is fantastic!! The Chef is personable  and passionate !! This is a hidden gem!!! I had the lamb chops with the mushroom risotto.  The lamb was juicy, I cut it with a butter knife, and the risotto was cooked to perfection. My husband had Mediterranean pasta, again cooked to perfection with each different seafood cooked exactly the way it should be!  The sauce should be bottled and sold delish!!!!  Oh yeah and the complimentary/warm garlic bread simply delicious.  The service was A+! We stayed after dinner just to listen to the live singer.  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Such a good place, all around. Support local, the food is excellent, and I highly recommend Wed/Thurs the pasta cheese wheel.   The chef usually comes out and greets diners, and remembers if you've been. Vegas needs more places like that. He does a great job of giving you a unique and delicious experience, and hey I don't even like Italian! But it's that good."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent! I had the eggplant Parmesan and the flavor was wonderful. I loved the breadsticks and dipping sauce and the house salad was wonderful. Can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Finally after a year of searching the Las Vegas area we found this place!! Omg... if love Italian food and cheese... and just food in general.. eat here!! Found this place on Yelp and I was sold when I read Weds nights were cheese wheel nights. So my husband and I came here and ordered the Vegetable Lumpia as an appetizer and Lobster Ravioli and Chicken Marsala with the cabornara? Pasta from the cheese wheel as a side. We were in Italian food heaven. And the place is so intimate. Don't let the shopping  mall fool you this is the place for family dining. My suggestion is everyone order something and just share it all. I loved that the chef came out to talk with us as well. I'm very excited to look into his cooking club that meets twice a month. Definately a diamond in the rough here in the Las Vegas desert.   UPDATE!!  May 26th, 2018... ordered their special.. Filet Mignon with shrimp, mushroom risotto and asparagus... OMG sooo mouthwatering!! Seriously.. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"What a Gem in Henderson, Nv!  Finally, a restaurant with a beautiful ambiance and fantastic food! The service is amazing and the Chef even cooked with our children. Thank you Rose!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for accommodating us this weekend - our group of 22 ppl had so much fun, enjoyed the yummy food/breads included, good services (thanks for separating the checks for us!) and great atmosphere - bravo for the live music!   I'd recommend this place to anyone, family style, no dress code, plenty of parkings, i'd love to come back.  thanks again!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem had great food and friendly service. The chef is super friendly and came out to check on everyone.  We started with the caprese and the lobster bisque. The caprese was done with fresh burrata cheese and perfectly ripened tomatoes. The bisque was tasty, especially when paired with the fresh breadsticks. My husband had the adobo nation, which is a braised pork belly and chicken dish. The flavors were beyond expectations. It's served with a risotto. He was really happy. I ordered the Linguini alla  Mediterranean. The seafood was perfectly cooked and tender. The flavors of the pasta and sauce were fantastic.  This visit reminded me of my trip to Italy. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Booked an reservation for a family birthday. Upon arrival, the reservation was cancelled as a private party was booked for the venue. Quite displeased by the handling of the situation and the communication. I would not recommend this restaurant and prefer to use others in the area."}
{"text":"This is a small Italian restaurant that opened this past May.  Chef Rudy previously served as executive chef at the long standing Ventano's.  Warm garlic rolls were served which were largely ignored.  We decided to share the chef's eponymous salad, but what arrived at our table 20 minutes after ordering was the frisee classica (frisee, cherry tomatoes, caramelized walnuts and apple wood bacon dressing) which was light and delicious. The restaurant was busy for a Tuesday evening and Rudy had only a sous chef in the kitchen so it was a full 45 minutes after ordering that we received our entrees.  I hitched my wagon, or at least my waistline, once again to the chef by ordering Chef Rudy's Adobo Nation (chicken Adobo, pork tenderloin, soy, red wine vinegar) that was served with a side of creamy asperagus (sic) risoto (sic). This dish was very good with kudos extended to the the excellent  risotto.  My wife was not as fortunate with her chicken Marsala entree that came with pasta awash in Marsala sauce.  Near the end of the meal I caught our server and requested a glass of water.  Either he did not understand or simply ignored my request in order to bus 2 empty tables. In my opinion, Chef Rudy needs to spend more time tending to details in the kitchen than spending time  schmoozing with his customers."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food all around!! They have live music and the service is awesome!! Can't wait to come back to Il Chianti again soon!! Even though it's about 30 minutes away from our house, it's definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was absolutely fabulous. This is a once a month or every other month kinda place for us though because of the cost. Only complaint if it's even a complaint is when ordering to-go the gal who took our order was \"flighty\" didn't seem interested in what we were ordering. Never got our name or anything and had to put us on hold for a bit because she was talking to someone. Was great for the pick up just not great on the phone."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and the food is always amazing.  My favorite dishes thus far are the adobo nation and the cheese tortellini. I love the intimate atmosphere, from the white tablecloths and dim lighting to the live soft guitar/piano music.  Everytime I've come, Chef Rudy has come out to personally greet us.  I appreciate that nice personal touch.  Today, the service was slower than usual but it was understandable as it was a full house! This is a definite hidden gem in Henderson that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, quiet and friendly. Service is excellent and the food is delicious and all home made. Come meet chef Rudy he'll create you in person. If you live in Henderson your crazy not to come here, we drive from the rest side to enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere.  We've been here for dinner and lunch and had excellent experiences both times. Chicken parmigiana was delicious, as well as the chicken Marsala.  For lunch I ordered the Philly cheesesteak, which was one of the best I've ever had.  The service was excellent with the chef coming out to talk with customers.  Henderson needed a place like this. And before I forget the bread and calamari were both great as well"}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food place in the city not only excellent food but food is prepared with love.  The chef is very personable and clearly loves to cook for people.  I've been here twice now. My friend had chicken Parmesan and it was amazing. I had the Mediterranean pasta w scallops and shrimp also I had the lobster ravioli Both were delicious. Small firm scallops tasted perfect! Great selection on wines as well."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Actually just stop by after the gym figured I would give this place a shot and I was so pleasantly surprised period and incredible menu and very unique food and not unique in a bad tasting way but combinations of foods you wouldn't have thought to put together that are absolutely terrific. For example lamb chops with dates and they were actually terrific. Chicken piccata, chicken franchese, Chicken Parmesan they have everything you can think of. Chef Rudy very nice comes out and is very appreciative of the business. Not like some of these restaurant owners that act like you owe them to come to their restaurant. He is very grateful and his food and staff show it. I actually recommend this restaurant and will be returning many many times."}
{"text":"2 person's dinner for $100 not worth it for a tiny place that has no ambiance, very loud and cramp. Backround live singer sounds nice  but hey there is more than enough noise going on in this place.  Staff spends more time talking to customers about who knows  instead of getting our order quick and getting drinks and food out.  Bread sticks dripping in butter (yaks ) , chicken parm cut in tiny slices  ( who does that ) and creme brulee cold and bland( yawn)   house cappuccino $ 7.00 yaks . besides I noticed they have no website on their own. Great staff going around too often    asking you to comeback  buthey improve this place and I might."}
{"text":"These are the delicious items we ordered   the names don't matter cause everything is so amazingly good  Everything is made from scratch here and the chief Rudy is an amazing cook and person.   The service here is on point and you feel at home   This place is a MUST TRY!!!  Enjoy and thank me later"}
{"text":"What delicious food!!! The cheese and pear tortellini was so amazing, you can tell it is all homemade. The staff here treats you more like family then anything. Great atmosphere, live music and every nice diners.  5 Star for service! 5 Star for great tasting food!"}
{"text":"My daughter graduated HS today and our family ( 12 of us ) celebrated with dinner at Il Chianti. This is the place for the best Italian food in the Las Vegas area. We each ordered something different and every one of our dishes was delicious!  The service is on point and the staff makes you feel like you are part of their family.  Chef Rudy came out to our table to welcome us and have a few laughs. Great food, great service and a comfortable atmosphere! I can't wait to go back! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant! Staff was amazing and on top of everything. Their bread... ohhh my god their bread. Freshly baked and sooooo good. They get 4 stars just for the bread! I went with my family and we all said that their main courses were okay. I got a sausage dish but I really didn't like the taste of the sausage (a first for me with sausage). Two of my aunts got the pizza and said it was only okay. We all ended up throwing away our leftovers."}
{"text":"The best veal dinner I have had since I left New York! Chef Rodolfo Janeo is a master in the kitchen and a warm host. DJ took care of us at the table and the live music helped make the evening such a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Walked in at approx 2pm and was seated at a table on a Saturday.  There was myself and 2 other couples. There was a breakfast menu on the table and thought she misunderstood.  While looking at it and not wanting anything on the menu, I was about to walk out.  Then she asked if I wanted the dinner menu....yes!  Got fettuccine with sea scallops and shrimp with sauce.  It was delicious!  I am not a big eater and always have leftovers, which is preferred; however, this was truly a dish for one; I finished it all.  While waiting for my meal, the chef/owner came over and mentioned that I should make a reservation.  I was taken aback since 1) I was seated immediately and 2) only mtyself and 4 other people in the restaurant.  It was obvious they were setting up (& loudly) for a large party.   PRO: excellent food; would have loved a larger portion for $25.00 CON: Was told: \"Next time make a reservation.\"  No bar. Plain ambiance."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and lovely atmosphere. A real gem, I now how a great Italian restaurant to go to when I visit my parents!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch with my husband and we were pleasantly surprised by such good food! The atmosphere was cute and quiet for a Sunday afternoon, exactly what we were looking for. Service was great and the chef even came out to the table after service to say hello. Homemade pasta was delicious and the dishes were so good. Only downside is that my sauce broke while I was eating so by the time I finished my meal the pasta was sitting in a bowl of melted butter. Now I a awesome at repressing my knowledge of butter and cream levels in a cream sauce (yay for subconscious rationalization) but that was too much to be appealing for me. Overall we'll definitely come back and give it another try. I love to see and support a local chef in a setting like this."}
{"text":"This place is, and forever will be, Rudy's Place!  My folks had been here once before and took me, themselves having been invited by friends who are regulars here. Their rave reviews were well-warranted.  Chef Rudy is clearly classically trained, and his menu shows it, with favorites such as over a dozen pasta dishes, salads, and an abundance of chicken and veal entrees. However, I believe that Rudy's Filipino heritage still shines true with a healthy attention to southern Italian seafood with coastal greats like cioppino, and a whole section dedicated to risotto -- and if that wasn't enough he features his own spin of chicken adobo and lumpia!  While located in a shopping mall the locale of quiet Henderson, NV keeps it away from the chaotic hustle and bustle of Las Vegas proper, but still within sight of the Strip. In fact it even overlooks it, making it a great spot come July 4th or New Years when the fireworks start to fly! The interior is decorated smartly, with a corner bristling with wines, a large open window to the kitchen in the back, and a live guitarist/keyboardist near the front.  We were immediately greeted by smiling servers who took us to our seats. The other patrons were attired in a mix of smart casual, sportcoats, dresses, jeans, families, and young couples clearly out on a date. In short, no one felt out of place.  While initially my thought was to try Chef Rudy's chicken parmigana, which is how I gauge all my Italian restaurants, my eyes were immediately drawn to his chicken adobo and its description. Chicken filets paired with risotto, with asparagus and pork belly, there was nothing in that sentence I didn't like.  For an appetizer we tried the shrimp bruschetta. The shrimp had delightful heat, the bread crusty but soaked through the center with the sauce and oil giving each bite an almost juicy feel. Paired with the bruschetta slices was a salad with a smoky vinaigrette, smoky due to the bacon bits that gave the greens a nice crunch.  The table bread was fresh out of the oven, soft on the inside, delicately topped with toasted cheese, and absolutely amazing. The only reason we didn't order triple refills was to save room for the main course. And I'm glad we did.  My adobo was scrumptious, Chef Rudy's adding a bit more sweetness and tang to his adobo sauce to complement the risotto and asparagus. The chicken was incredibly tender and aromatic, and the risotto itself perfectly al dente.  The other entrees we selected were the cioppino - which was overflowing with clams, mussels, squid, salmon chunks, and shrimp in an aromatic broth with just enough of a zesty kick; and the veal parmigana which was melt-in-your-mouth with al dente pasta.  All throughout the staff were incredibly friendly, always refilling our beverages and checking in on us. Chef Rudy himself was personally checking at each table, greeting and making small talk with each of his patrons. With his regulars, of which there were many, he would stay and chat even longer, even pulling up a chair and conversing with them at length before returning to his kitchen.  He even recognized my folks from their last visit, even getting my mother an extra side of pasta for her cioppino without blinking. In talking with him, he is a man very clearly proud of his food and his craft, expressing that he was more interesting in delivering quality food and experience rather than opening countless locations. He loves giving back to his community and to his homeland.  Apparently on Tuesdays and Wednesdays he hosts a special dining event where pasta dishes are served in cheese wheels. If that was not reason enough to go out and try Rudy's Place, then clearly you just don't love good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Excellant atmosphere. Did not have reservations but was seated happily. Seems to be many regulars where the staff hugs and welcomes. Has an old school feel. The food has an excellent flavor.  All around great experience. Will be back without a doubt.."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant by accident and we weren't impressed with the cooking. We were looking for an Italian restaurant and everything tasted like Asian cuisine. For appetizers we had pork belly on sliced bread.  The pork belly was covered with teriyaki sauce and the bread was covered with garlic butter. The calamari appetizer was very chewy and very messy to eat. As a main dish I had Adobe Chicken with Pork Belly and the sauce tasted just like my appetizer. The meal for two people for 100.00 was not worth it. Olive Garden would have tasted better and way cheaper.  However, I did like the service of the staff and we thought it was awesome that the Chef came out and greeted the customers"}
{"text":"Food is excellent as always.  Dinner is great and the lunch menu is really good.  Love Chef's take on a Cuban sandwich.  Very flavorful.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in, I already knew this place was going To be AMAZING! Chef Rudy Janeo is super hospitable. First thing he did was hand me a sample of his DELICIOUS pork belly. Food - FANTASTIC. Service - On point. HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)"}
{"text":"An unassuming foodies dream in a strip mall. Aren't they always the best? Very deserving of the Near-5 star rating on yelp. Service is top notch every time. Food is Italian done well and right. Delicious. Ambience is intimate or community with your choice of white linen tables inside/outside or a big community table on patio with twinkle lights. Choose your own adventure. I've had the eggplant parm, Caesar salad, meatballs and canolli there. All super yummy. What can I say. I am a fan of il Chianti."}
{"text":"Exquisite meal!  On a consistent basis this restaurant has exemplary food. Chef Rudy has skill, passion, and a clear love of cooking.  Chef Rudy greets and chats with you to make sure you get what you want. Today they were doing their brunch menu, but the chef whipped up an on the spot alternative for us, a pork belly burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was outstanding topped with pork belly, cheese and  a freshly fried egg. The sweet potato fries were fresh and perfectly seasoned. The service was friendly, and quick."}
{"text":"Dinner was wonderful. Nice atmosphere and the prices aren't too bad considering . This is a date night kinda place.   Lunch was an epic fail. Dry sandwiches with very little on them. We were surprised at the difference from lunch to dinner.  I would go back but not for lunch."}
{"text":"Il Chianti is so delicious! It is one of my favorite local restaurants and my daughters and I love to go have a meal here about once per month. The owner/chef is so friendly and amazing! He comes out from the kitchen and greets his guests throughout the evening, asking with genuine care how you like your dish. Everything we've had has been simply divine so our answer is always \"DELICIOUS\"! I am certain though that if something weren't to our satisfaction or liking her would personally see to it that we had something more suited to our tastes without hesitation.  The ambiance is also lovely. The restaurant is small and quaint, and feels so warm and welcoming. Some nights there is even live music (piano and/or acoustic guitar). We love Il Chianti and will continue to frequent and support our local business owner. If you haven't yet tried this place do your taste buds a favor and go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very good service. The owner is the chef so you know he aims to please"}
{"text":"Looking at the outside you would think it was a regular small mall Italian restaurant, but we were wrong. This is probably one of the friendliest and most comfortable places to eat. I had exceptional prime rib w/ a unique Italian sauce. My girlfriend had the veal which she said was fantastic. All I can say is this place was great, the waitress was SUPER and chef came over to make sure we were satisfied. We ended up getting there at 6 P.M. and staying till they closed. Having dessert, wine and enjoying the guitar player. A truly GREAT experience and evening for a Thursday."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant that I have been to in Henderson. Love it! The chef treated us like we were regulars. We will be.The wait staff were do awesome. I have celiac disease and they made sure I could eat. My son absolutely loved the eggplant silano. I cannot wait to bring my husband. Whenever we want Italian, this restaurant is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Loving this new restaurant! It is really delicious!! I love the Chefs unique additions to the Italian menu, like the \"egg rolls\" for appetizer(YUM) This side of Henderson has been needing a GOOD Restaurant for a long time and it looks like our wait is over! If your contemplating whether to try this little hot spot, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight on a date based on Yelp reviews.  Upon pulling up I was a little nervous as it was pretty much in a strip mall.  But we had reservations so we walked in and was seated promptly ( our seat had a reserved symbol).    Long story short, our server was incredible and recommended every dish we ate.  The Chef came out and greeted every table (so awesome), and there was an awesome guitarist playing music to tracks softly in the background.  Screw going to the strip for fine dining.  This is a hidden gem.   Advice.... Make a Reservation!!! This place packs out quick for dinner!!!   Will be back here many more times to hopefully try all their dishes."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Italian restaurant in Henderson.  The food is superb, cozy atmosphere, and very friendly staff!  Chef Rudy is so nice and came out to greet us!  Try the mushrooms and dates in adobo sauce appetizer...fabulous!  This is a restaurant you should definitely put on your list to try out soon...you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this dinner.  Wonderful chef Rudy really cares about his food and his customers.  Support this family run business and have a nice, romantic dinner with the one your love!"}
{"text":"This was excellent italian food. Some of the best we've had. Great seafood dishes and the lamb chops were amazing! We don't live here, but will definitely come back when we're here on vacation again. Chef Rudy came out and chatted with us, that was very cool!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came across this place and we decided to try it.  He had the Veal Parmesan which was delicious and I had the Linguine Fra-Diavolo.  Spicy but very tasty.  We will be back"}
{"text":"My girl and I walked in not expecting the staff and chef were so nice. I had the chicken Marsala my girl had the tortilini..... amazing!!!!! Definitely a must go!!!! Fantastic work chef!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me and my friend here for lunch and I must say I had the best bruschetta ever and the onion soup was bursting with rich flavors and of course the Lynn pear and shrimp pasta was full of deliciousness...i will definitely come back here on my next visit to Las Vegas.  The place had the right ambiance and the service was good...Next I come back I must say hello to Chef Rudy and personally tell him how delicious his food was.....see you next visit..."}
{"text":"5 Stars! I love this place! This place is on my list when my expectations are high and my appetite seeks to be satisfied for an nice Italian dinner.  Love the food! Love the people! Love the atmosphere! and........  I just love the Chef! What is the Chef's secret ingredient? According to the servers, the Chef's secret ingredient in preparing his signature dishes is . . . cooking with .... \"LOVE\" !! ------  That explains is all........ --why I leave IL Chianti as a more loving person! Thank you Mr. Chef Janeo, for your warm welcoming smiles, your dishes that feed the heart as well as our tummies, and your inspiring reminder to live in the moment of enjoying your restaurant with food, family, friends, & fun."}
{"text":"*Customer service is top notch! Friendly smiles, recognition, very attentive, the chef Rodolfo is awesome! Super passionate and warm gentleman. Tons of laughs shared.  *Very clean as well. Wouldn't expect anything less. Had to use the restroom later on, very clean as well.  *The food was AMAZING!! I had the lobster ravioli and antipasti, to die for! Very fresh and flavorful! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places I have ever been. The food is always amazing and the chef makes you feel like you are right at home. I have never had bad service. Did I mention that the food is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"What a great birthday dinner tonight!  Started with tasty, hot breadsticks.   My mom started with the french onion soup and said it was the best she ever had. Dad started with the caprese salad - ditto.  For entrees,  the table had veal piccata, pizza,  capellini pomodoro,  the antipasto platter and tonight's special,  which was pasta in a cream sauce after being stirred in a 50 lb circle of cheese!  Homemade desserts of gelato and cannolis ended a delicious dinner.   Service was great and Chef Rudy spent quite a bit of time working the room.  We are going to come back for the next family birthday!"}
{"text":"OMG!  nom nom nom!  Awesome Salmon Special!  Canoli was over the top!  Gonna 'splode!  The dining room is white table cloth, the Friday night live music was very nice.  This is a really enjoyable restaurant and is close to home.  I think this will be my \"go to\" spot for upscale Italian cuisine.  The chef really cares and visited all the tables.  During the week, this is the place to take a date for a nice romantic meal.  Good food.  Good wine.  Good loving!"}
{"text":"Wow   Even though there was a wait to get our order in and to get water the food was so worth the wait.   We set a reservation at 7pm but arrived early, the hostess said there would be a 10min wait so we waited outside. The chef came out to apologize and sat us right away. He was super nice but even if he hadn't done that - the food speaks for itself.   Word to the wise - make reservations"}
{"text":"I had the Linguine Con Scampi and it had way too much lemon it was way too difficult to eat. I had my friend try it and agreed. I didn't want to take it back of fear that they might do something nasty to my dish... not saying they would have, but I wasn't going to take that chance."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. I like how Chef ? visits each table. They start you off with the  ... I  it! I can eat it all day! Scrumptious food  ."}
{"text":"Beyond fabulous.   Not much to look at on the outside, but inside it is very nicely decorated, and great atmosphere.   The food was some of the best Italian I have had.  All of us loved every portion of  the meal.  We had a date and mushroom appetizer, with light red sauce - more Asian than Italian, that was to die for.  I had the special - a sausage and shrimp linguini with a light garlic sauce.  Loaded with shrimp and sausage - just a little spice, and tons of flavor.   Sangria was also fantastic.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  We have eaten at so many Italian restaurants, and if not the best, certainly ranks right at the top"}
{"text":"We saw that this restaurant had opened in our neighborhood, so we wanted to give it a try. My husband had the chicken marsala.  He has a thing about ordering this at almost every italian restaurant.  This is how he decides whether the food is good or not.  It was amazing!  I had the cheese tortellini - tons of chicken and gooey cheese! We also had two appetizers and they were equally delicious.  Service was outstanding - Chef Rudy came by several times to check on us.  Obviously takes pride in his work.  Staff was friendly and attentive!  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place when we come to Henderson/Lake Mead/Las Vegas.  The service is always top notch, the food amazing, and the owner always comes out an talks with you."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian restaurant! The fresh bake bread is to die for...super yummy! My husband had the pear pasta dish that we all loved, I had the spaghetti bolognese that had so much meat in it, the rest of our party loved what they had. we shared a yummy calamari and bruschetta that was just delish. The owner/chef makes you feel at home, he came out a couple of times and checked on each table.  A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good restaurant close to home and Google Maps recommended this spot.  We read Yelp reviews and reviewed to give it a try.  We are so glad we did!!!!   The bread basket was so good!  The balsamic vinegar with the oil was delicious!  It was an aged balsamic that was sweet but savory.  We opted for the chef's special and it did not disappoint.  $35 for salad, pasta and filet mignon.  It was a dressed Caesar, which was delicious.  The pasta was bucatini, which was cooked in a Parmigiano Reggiano cheese barrel!  Soooo good!  The filet was small, but just the right size to accompany the decadent pasta.  It was atop a marinara sauce, and accompanied by crisp prosciutto.  The fresh pasta was simply amazing.  The chef came to our table twice and we enjoyed chatting with Chef Rudy.  We assured him we will be back.  The waitress told us about the special Valentine's Day prix fix menu and we were intrigued.  This is a neighborhood gem in Henderson.  Small, quaint, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the \"BEST ITALIAN\" we've had in the Vegas/Henderson area!!  Chef Rudy, and his staff are amazing, so nice and right there for your every want!! Such an amazing dining experience!! And Calvin (entertainment) made the evening perfect!! Thank you, we will certainly be back.."}
{"text":"We went to Chianti to celebrate my mom's birthday last night. The service was impeccable, the ambiance was beautiful, and the food was top notch!   We had the vegetable egg rolls and the calamari for appetizers. The egg rolls were delicious. The sauce that was drizzled on top was what people from Hawaii call \"ono.\" The sauce for the calamari was also delicious.   I had the chicken adobo with risotto. The risotto was yummy in my tummy. I love the little bits of asparagus with the risotto. The chicken adobo was very tasty, a little to sweet for my liking, but still enjoyable. I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder but the kitchen was out of clams. I had the lobster bisque instead. The bisque was very rich and tasty.  My sister ordered the seafood pan coast and she let me have a taste. The pieces of salmon, scallops, shrimp with the sauce was so yummy. My mom ordered the seafood risotto and it was a heaping serving of seafood: lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, and squid. It was very tasty. My nephew and brother had the veal adobo and they said it was good.   Then the kitchen made a special dessert for my mom, ice cream and little fluffy donuts. The staff and other patrons help sing and wish my mom a very happy birthday! Thank you Chef Rudy and your wonderful staff for a delicious wonderful evening! Chef Rudy came and sat down with us at the table and talked about his passion for serving great food and providing a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Chef Rudy made my dad's birthday dinner a wonderful evening. It's unusual to dine at a restaurant where the chef gets so involved in the dining experience and it truly adds to it.  We live just up the street and had heard good things so we decided to try Il Chianti out. Portions were generous, bread was good, service was great. For a small sized restaurant it has a nice feel and the food was not cheap at all. Will be coming back to try the Dalla Forma pasta"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for dinner and the food was below average.  Cold chicken breast that had been reheated with some red sauce, I have had better tv dinners.  The real kicker was an 18% gratuity added to our check with out saying a word."}
{"text":"Each plate costs about $22, which isn't terrible considering the location and other mid-scale chain Italian restaurant prices. The problem I have is that both plates my wife and I ordered were served to us on dirty dishes.  This also isn't a deal breaker most of the time if the wait staff handles it correctly. Unfortunately in my case when I pointed out the dirty dishes to our waitress she immediately gave an excuse about how the cheese that gets put on the dishes burns to a crisp when under the Salamander heating table they use. This was a problem as she didn't even look at our plates before giving the excuse- which implies either they've had complaints like this before and have chosen not to do anything about it, or more importantly, she didn't even care to examine in case it was something other than cheese (which it definitely was in both our cases-- mine was a caked on sauce with flakes in it, my wives looked to be dried Fettuccine sauce). Not the type to be argumentative, I simply asked for the bill. The waitress then gave me the bill and a speech about how she told her chef to be more careful in the future. Much to our surprise the chef then came around the corner and asked us if we had tried the Limoncello and asked if we enjoyed our meal-- which wouldn't have been the case had he been informed we didn't eat it because of the dirty plates as we had -just- been told he was informed of. The restaurant was not busy. There is no excuse. Further complaints: the shrimp used in one of our dishes was clearly store bought frozen shrimp. The ambient music was from Pandora- which wouldn't be noticeable if the commercial free pandora was being paid for instead of advertised in between every third song. Finally, as it was apparent we weren't going to eat the food provided and were not satisfied with the excuse of cheese being melted into our plates (which even if it legitimately was -which it wasn't-, maybe take a second to wipe the 22 dollar plate off before serving it) we were given a 10 percent discount on the plates. These should have been comped. I will never return."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  Go early; it fills up fast."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian food!!!  Chef Rudy out does himself in his own restaurant! !!  Congratulations,  chef!!  You have a winner!!  Best Italian food in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and the menu was excellent. Try the eggs and waffles or the stuff french toast! Mimosas and sangria,"}
{"text":"My wife goes to the gym next door and came home having seen the menu proclaiming we needed to try Il Chianti.  I immediately went on Yelp and checked out the menu and became excited after reading the reviews.  First off, my wife and I are about 30, and have three kids, so it's very hard to find a night where we can go out and enjoy a dinner alone without the whole fam.  Tonight, however, we had a babysitter and an early movie - so we decided to drop in at 4:30, old folks style.    We walked in, only one other couple was seated and eating, so we decided to eat outside in the gorgeous weather.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, we had about three others come out during the course of our meal and fill water, clean plates, etc.  All of the wait staff were friendly, chatty, and professional.  Rudy, the chef, wandered out after we received our calamari and chatted for a while, asking about us and talking about kids, life, etc.  He was incredibly charming, very polite and I have to say he has it figured out, from other reviews I can tell this is something he does regularly and it is a fantastic touch and you can tell it is not forced.  On to the food.  We received two warm, oversized breadsticks that were soft and buttery, with a fantastic sweet balsamic with olive oil.  The calamari app was lightly breaded and the cuts were very tender, served with a marinara with sprinkled red pepper and another pinkish, house-made sauce that I believe the waitress said was a jalape√±o/cream sauce.  Both were fantastic.    To the meal; my wife ordered Lynn Pear Tortellini with rock shrimp.  Her meal immediately drew the eye, with a perfectly colored, reddish-orange sauce that was bright and made your mouth water.  My wife took her first bite and her eyes popped open, proclaiming the burst of flavor was incredible.  I tried a bite and loved what I had tasted as well.  All in all, a very lovely dish.   I had the veal piccata and it was flawed? But I am not going to include this in my review until I give it another shot - to be determined!  I would love to give Rudy and Il Chianti another chance.  It was, however, only one bad dish.  But again, date night doesn't come often and testing veal doesn't come cheap.  I am going to chalk this up as (hopefully) a one-time bad dish by the crew.  But 90% of what we had was fantastic!"}
