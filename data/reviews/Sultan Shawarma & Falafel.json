{"text":"If you're looking for a shawarma in this area, this is your only option. Better tasting options are downtown or in Scarborough. 

Had the traditional chicken shawarma. one of my favourite toppings are the pink pickled radishes. For some reason the ones here were not looking very appetizing. They were old and grey looking. I decided to opt out of those just to be on the safe side. Disappointed that they don't make their own hot sauce like many of the small mom and pop shops - this one was commercial. 

Price was good and the sandwich size reflected the price you were paying.

This place gets a bit of traffic from being in close proximity to the subway - hungry passengers picking up something a quick lunch or dinner.  Convenient place if you live/work in the area."}
{"text":"Shouldn't say you're open until a certain hour but not serve up until that time... Wanted to try it but couldn't."}
{"text":"Last night two of us tried the Sultan for takeout. Small as it is, the food and service were great. We got chicken plates, with extra eggplant and cauliflower. Great taste and quality. Convenient location, so next time will try eating there.Glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"Business did not honour yelp offer. Was told the offer applied \"to another location\". Sandwich was good though."}
{"text":"My favourite Shwarma/Falafal place in the East End. Reasonable prices and so tasty. As was mentioned it is not the best looking restaurant but the service is friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice guy behind the counter. Quick, efficient, and easy going.

I got a mixed plate, which was delicious. The food all seems to be on the high-end of standard shawarma fare, in terms of quality and freshness. Large portions at very reasonable prices.

Decorum is a little dingy, and there isn't much space for seating if it's busy, which it appears to get. While I was sitting plenty of locals dropped by for a chat; that's always a good sign."}
{"text":"Great food at any time of the day.the best shawarma ever.  Fresh and hot. Great staff"}
{"text":"I think this place is amazing an totally great cause the food is awesome an I think what makes there even better is the people who are currently working there now cause it's great to have wonderful food but it's also great to have The workers having a conversation with the customers an myself seeing mostly everyone who goes in there leaving with a smile an the pricing is Awesome an filling I also love how it's open late"}
{"text":"I love their chicken shawarmas and chicken  shawarma plate. I always get the plate-- loaded with chicken, crisp & crunchy, fresh veggies, everything is light and healthy. Quite a hefty portion compared to other shawarma places I've been to. None compare to Sultan's, I swear by it!!!!! 
Everyone needs to check them out. Great service, too. They always know my order. :)"}
{"text":"By far, one of the best shawarma places in Toronto. The staff is always friendly. The food is fresh, generous and best of all, cheap!"}
{"text":"Went in for some late night eats as everything in the area was practically closed - should've just gone to McDonald's. 

Ordered a falafel on a pita and a drink.  

Upon checking in from this app I noticed a free drink with sandwich purchase promotion and proceeded to show it to him.  Decided not to honor it anyway. 

When I got to eating it I noticed inside the pathetic excuse for falafel inside!
So small and misshapen. 

All in all it appears they dont care about business and the lack of quality really indicates the latter."}
{"text":"I'm a falafel fiend and this is one of the best in the city. Fresh ingredients, cooked to order, tell em to go light on the sauce unless you like to make a mess and get extra turnip.

A special spice in the balls gives them a distinct flavour. All for under $4 bucks, I always grab one when im in the hood."}
{"text":"I've been picking up food here for mmmmm years.   Good shawarma -chicken/beef/mixed.  Love their pickled turnips and their homemade sauces are great. Buy some of the sauces (in the fridge by the cash) to take home.  Soooo good.  Definitely fast and uh fast service.   Missed my Mortimer 62 bus by minutes.   12 minutes til the next one.  Zipped into Sultan's, ordered 2 fully loaded beef shawarma and made it back to Main Stn with 2 minutes to spare. The shawarma were still hot when I got home.   Tasty, no frills, super affordable (2 beef shawarma, inc. tax =$10 straight up)."}
{"text":"Two mixed plates with veggies spicy with extra white sauce and pita bread . When I used to take the TTC i get off at Main Street and walk towards Sultan and order this almost daily. Never got tired of it even till this day. If I couldn't decide what to eat I wouldn't hesitate to get mixed plates. I get their wraps when I need a snack and plates when I'm hungry. Love this place. Great staff and service ."}
{"text":"This was my favourite place for shawarma, portions are large and about $13-14 a plate that comes with meat, mixed rice, salad and a plain pita. I use to come here more often but less now. The rice and salad that is included in the meat plate is nice. But the meat is a bit dry. I like the white sauce and hummus that is included. The shawarma wrap is also nice too."}
