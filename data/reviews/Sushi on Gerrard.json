{"text":"We were thrilled to find a new sushi place within walking distance from our house and even more thrilled to discover that it is terrific! The owner, Queenie, and her chef husband are warm and welcoming and eager to please. They have renovated the old Collegiate Diner, which had its charm for sure, and have made it comfortable and modern. We love sushi and were not disappointed. We have been back with our children four times. The chef finely chops his fish before literally stuffing the handrolls so it melts in your mouth. His hot sauce is unique, less mayonnaise-y than the hot sauce used at many sushi places. The beef teriyaki and vegetables are fantastic. Oshitashi was delicious and light. Wonderful miso soup. Try the spicy tuna handrolls, spicy white tuna roll, spicy scallop roll, sashimi, chirashi, it's all great. Service is attentive and charming. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Don't order from here if you want quick delivery. They will tell you an hour, but it will be way longer.sushi is decent if you are willing to wait"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out on a lazy Friday for lunch. It just so happened the place was packed with students when I arrived. Apparently there is a student special that consists of several rolls (California, spicy salmon, combination). It wasn't advertised so I'm not sure of the price. So I peruse the menu, although it appeared vast, the lunch specials were somewhat limited in their combinations. So I see this photo of a bento box on the menu with sashimi, seafood veggie tempura, and some fish teriyaki on rice - I asked the waiter if they had that option as I didn't see it on the menu. He said no, that is just a picture. Huh?!.....Lunch options were limited to sushi lunch, sashimi lunch, bento box with teriyaki or tempura options, or rolls.  You could for the life of you not mix and match & there were no pre-set combos that would allow you to do so. Later on, I realized why...

I decided to try the sashimi lunch for $12. My order came fairly quickly. The starter salad was ok. The dressing was good however included in my salad was a piece of cucumber that was an end piece taken off a previously refrigerated cucumber. The miso soup was mediocre as I definitely have had way better. 

Despite the place being a full house, my order came fairly quickly. My sashimi platter consisted of generous portion of salmon but unfortunately, the pieces progressively got smaller. There was salmon, tuna, hamachi (yay my fav but boo bc portion was skimpy), octopus (two teeny tiny pieces) and two pieces of seared white tuna (extremely tiny and flavor was meh). The whole thing came with a bowl of rice and a side of ginger that you have to specifically request.

Overall the selection was adequate and the sashimi tasty. Portions were however very skimpy. Had I known, I would have ordered the 18 piece sashimi dinner. 

The service was impeccable for me in spite of the waitress and staff were working frantically to fill all the orders. 

Since the orders took so long, one of the students had to forfeit a second order of the salmon lover platter since he had to rush back to class. They however were nice enough not to make him pay eventhough they had started cutting the pieces and he had consumed the salad and soup. He generously offered to pay but they were nice enough to let it go. 

The decor is a mix of modern and old school. The walls were decorated with mirrors with gold splatters and a stick on number was placed above each table. They do have alcohol however for some reason no cranberry juice (as I overheard the other table ordering and the waitress stating that they don't have cranberry). There is also a poster warning pregnant women not to drink during pregnancy. Interesting... I thought pregnant women aren't supposed to be having raw fish.... The irony. 

I noticed that the other table's customer had ordered the sashimi lunch but had received two pieces of white tuna that were a bit larger than my 1/3 of a kit kat bar portion but they were not seared. Also, I overheard them charge $15 for the sashimi dinner for a regular customer. Whaaat?! 

Overall, I give this place a 3 star as food is decent and service is good but portion were too small and the 3 staff looked like they were having trouble keeping up with the orders.  There was a small confusion at the table where they ordered 4 student specials as it comes with either a drink, salad, or soup & the 4 girls had ordered different types of roll.  No wonder the lunch menu was so simplified - if you allowed mix and match, you can only imagine what the outcome might be.  They did give me extra tea even after I paid my bill which is nice bonus."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Tried it out because it had decent reviews. Wasn't busy and everything was delicious and tasted very fresh. Very nice presentation and friendly service"}
{"text":"Have had lunch here a few times and always great. Kind, polite service. Clean restaurant. Good food. Good prices. 

They also deliver and have take out. Haven't tried that yet but, will try it soon!

A definite must try for the neighbourhood folk!"}
{"text":"Finally! An alternative to Sushi Marche. 

Visited on Valentine's Day Eve as the SO and I were both too tired to bother with dinner. Street parking is free after 4pm over here, so we decided to drive and save ourselves from the snow. Smallish restaurant, with four booths and four tables of four (or so). We started with Miso soups, which were delicious. Soups and the green tea ice cream are not on the house here, take note. We then ordered a sushi boat (Maki) which was around $40. It was delicious. Good quality sushi, inventive flavours. Nice little touches like nice quality dishes and soy sauce dispensers. Servers are warm, friendly and accommodating. They definitely do takeout, as multiple people came in for pickup during the time we were there.

At the end of the meal they brought chocolates and a red rose as it was valentines day. Very sweet.  Welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I switched over to this place because my usual take out joint (Kibo Queen E.) sushi was closed. Turns out the food here was way better. I always get Chirashi when I get sushi and although the Chirashi is slightly more expensive at Sushi on Gerrard, it's definitely worth it. I find they always take time on the presentation of the food, even with takeout. The fish tastes fresh, and there's quite the variety of seafood in the Chirashi here. Other places will give you three pieces of salmon, tuna, and 2-3 other seafood and call it Chirashi, but here you get a piece of everything. I really like the variety and the addition of the veggies too. And there's a good rice to fish ratio. The miso soup & salad are good here too. Anyway, I'm a huge fan. I've never eaten in, but the atmosphere seems nice and the restaurant looks clean."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times in the past and always really liked it... But we just placed an order for delivery online (6pm on a Sunday), and after an hour and 45 minutes of waiting, plus many unreturned phone calls, drove by to find them inexplicably closed (at this point abandoning our desire to have food delivered). I'm glad we had planned to pay cash rather than credit card, because the online system accepted our order and had even sent us a confirmation email. The least they could do is set up some kind of a notification either on their website or outgoing msg."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local sushi restaurant.  We go there so often that we've become regulars and the staff know us.  The sushi is tasty and relatively inexpensive. We have food delivered from them a lot, and the only reason I'm docking a point is that they've forgotten items on multiple occasions. Last time they left out a whole meal. Though the initial delivery time is long, they're relatively prompt to bring any items that were left out, though, so I can't get too mad."}
{"text":"having just moved to the area, found Sushi on Gerrard on yelp. glad i did! coming from Vancouver, it doesn't compare but for Toronto standards compared to other places on the Danforth..its much better. will be back for quick take out!"}
{"text":"Good food at fair price. Delivery is a little slow. But not terribly. Go to delivery sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Probably the freshest tasting sushi in the area at a fair price.  I've eaten here a number of times, and the food is consistently good. The menu has a large number of options to suit everyone's tastes."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of sushi in the area.... but overall I've found sushi on gerrard to be one of the best. Very fresh, good variety of sushi and sashimi, including handrolls. Also deliver via just-eat which is always great!"}
{"text":"I always order from this place. The reason is that it is one of the few more authentic Japanese restaurants in the city. It is actually the only place I found both Hiyayako and Takoyaki on the menu. Plus the fish is fresh!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Not many sushi places in the beaches deliver! Always great food. Fish is fresh and their sunshine rolls and AMAZING!!! They are quick with delivery and very pleasant to deal with!! I think the best thing about them is how accurate they are. We have been ordering from them for over 6 months at least once a week and they have not made a single mistake. And we love the little extras like soup and salad they throw in!! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Great food but not enough.

I bought a Red Dragon roll but only 3 rolls had all the advertised ingredients. 

Making the rolls a little bigger with all the ingredients would have netted these guys a five star. The food is actually very yummy."}
{"text":"Great place: great food, friendly staff, pretty quiet.  Our go-to sushi place.
I'm hoping this place can thrive with some of the new restaurants coming into the area."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was good except the sashimi. It wasnt bad but I would like it to be fresher. Understandable since its a new resto its hard to control the quality when there isnt a steady flow of customers yet. Over all thumbs up! I will be a repeat custome."}
{"text":"Delivery through Just Eat. Delicious vegetable sushi, vegetables, spring rolls, and seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"Not bad! Came here for dinner with a friend. Ordered: 
Seaweed salad (typical, which is good! pricey though - $4.50?)
Dragon roll (not bad, had a lot of spicy mayo on the plate for decoration so I used that as my sauce)
Spicy salmon roll 
Takoyaki (came with 6 I believe)
Small sake (enough for 4 shots - more than enough for 2 people lol)
Coconana (deep fried banana topped with honey and coconut)

No complaints, everything was good. Not mind blowing, but a nice find in the neighbourhood, so if I'm ever craving sushi I don't have to go downtown or further."}
{"text":"The only place I eat if I'm in the area. Sushi is so good, service is great. Always fast & friendly. The prices are fare. You get what you pay for & I believe it's worth it. Not that it's expensive. Cute atmosphere. If you're in the area it's the place to go."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this restaurant through JUST EAT.  I received a call from the restaurant 30min after the order was placed telling me they don't have a driver.  Then they asked me to come there to pick it up.  If I could go pick it up, I wouldn't have ordered delivery.  So I informed her that I don't drive and can't come.  I asked if I could just cancel my order and get my money back.  She then proceeds to tell me the food is already ready so she will try to get a driver and call me back in 15min otherwise cancel my order.  I had to agree because I was in the middle of taking care of my child(another reason for delivery).  All I could think while waiting for the call is why the heck would I want cold food?? Nothing she could have done at this point would have gotten the food here warm.  And this restaurant would have been fine serving cold food?  Very disappointed.  Hopefully, I get my money back with no trouble."}
{"text":"Great sushi for cheap!  Service is very polite and friendly but sushi is pretty slow, but worth it.  Have come here several times now for a snack on my way somewhere.  Clean and quiet.  Definitely one of my favourite spots in the area.

Wish they had AYCE"}
{"text":"Ordered a party platter for delivery and let's just say that I will never order from them again. Total waste of money. The sushi was OK, nothing impressive. Even my grandmother thought it was a joke when the food came. The pieces were the size of my pinky! 
I only ordered because of the unusually high rating but am really disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the Sashimi Dinner,  18 pieces of assorted sashimi for $23. It was fresh and tasty.

The dinner consisted of salad, soup and rice. Plus 3 pieces of each
Salmon
Tuna (deep red, firm, less fatty part)
Octopus
Butter fish
Bonito Tuna
Yellowtail"}
