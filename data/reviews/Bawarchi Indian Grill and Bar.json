{"text":"If you like flavor and spice this is the place to go! Great service by Praveen and a very nice atmosphere. We had the ginger chicken appetizer, chicken masala and chicken curry. The curry was very spicy in a good way and he did warn me ahead of time. Try the yogurt sauce if it is too spicy. The tempernillo red wine is delicious as is the king chakra beer. Oh and the cleanest bathrooms I have seen at a restaurant in a long time!"}
{"text":"As Indian food lovers, we drove out to Concord mills area to try this Indian restaurant. It sits back by Great Wolf Lodge. We each had an appetizer of chicken 555 and chili paneer. Our main course was chicken mughlai, and butter chicken. We had plain naan and puri. All of it was delicious. Although I had to ask for a plate to dish my food out on to. I did order my chili paneer to be mild, but it definitely had some heat whoo! The place is huge and has a full bar and an outside patio. There is another adjacent party room for functions."}
{"text":"Cut down on the batter and put in more fish in your Apollo dish.. $12 for 4 lil pieces of chicken in the tikka is day robbery.. persis biryani is the way to go if you are ok to drive an extra few miles.."}
{"text":"Nice authentic taste.. hope they maintain it for a long time.. one time there was a confusion with my Togo order.. could have been avoided.."}
{"text":"So good.. I ate take out from here last night but I'm already craving more. 
Just go.."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Especially Guntur chicken and goat biryani. Try it and you'll not be disappointed:("}
{"text":"This was an amazing find in Concord, NC. It just opened less than a month ago and grand opening is this weekend. Please try this restaurant.
I wanted a new place and boy did I find it. The food, customer service and environment are worth every penny.

I had the Tomato soup-not your everyday soup-as an appetizer. So delicious. I love Butter Chicken and Garlic Naan, and it doesn't get any better than this.

I just can't say enough about the incredible flavors in this food.

This is a must stop. Robin at the bar and Praveen, your host, alone are a reason to stop here. But it's the food that will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place and i was willing to give a shot. The service and quality of food was amazing. Our server Mahati, who was amazing and took care of everything we needed, she gave us really good recommendations to pick from the menu and we were not disappointed by it. We tried the Bawarchi Goat and masala chicken lollipop for appetizer. We also had palak paneer. Everything was amazing from start to finish. The only recommendation i would make is while most of the servers were professional and did their job flawlessly, but there was one server who was walking around with straw in his mouth and chewing on it. Its not appealing to customers as they are their for good food and ambiance. Its a minor thing to fix, and I will be back again. 

Overall I give this place a 4 out of 5 stars. 
Score from 1-10 = 8.3"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Went for soft opening, and while they are still working out some kinks, everything was delicious. Warning.. food is spicy for westerners and kiddos not used to spicy food."}
{"text":"Really liked karampodi chicken and mutton biryani...will come in again to try other delicacies for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! The biryani is so good. A little tangy with just the right amount of spicy at the medium level. The owner and wait staff were all very friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable and the portions are larger than expected. This is my new go to Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Biryani was good, but the Chicken tikka Masala was Outstanding! Loved it..good, friendly staff and great service as well!"}
{"text":"This is our 4th Indian restaurant since moving to Charlotte on May 25th. Each one has been very good, each one has had some dishes which were good but also some which should have come with warnings. The Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower) was very good but also very spicy. The butter chicken was everyone's favorite with the right amount of spice and flavor. The Vegetable Korma was also very good and full of vegetables. The Bawarchi Royalle Kura (shrimp curry) was good but needed several flags for the level of spice and fire. Eat it last after you've eaten everything else because you will not be able to taste or enjoy the other dishes. My lips and mouth are still burning 2 hours after we ate. But then, I savor the sensation. 

The most impressive thing about the restaurant was that most of the tables were occupied by families from India. That speaks loudly for the authenticity and quality of the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have ordered chicken dum biryani n boneless chicken biryani and veg biryani, all of the biryanis are worst. Boneless chicken biryani was mixed with fried chicken with some biryani rice. Chicken dum biryani was with full of oil and taste was bad, except carrots nothing was there in veg biryani. We couldn't even ate 1/4 of biryani\"s and it was bad experience in NC."}
{"text":"We are so thrilled that Bawarchi has opened one of their 42 locations in Concord, NC. 
My wife and I absolutely loved the food here. This place has become one of our favorites after just one visit. We received an excellent service by the Owner (Krishna) and attentive staff members. The chef (Suman) even came and spoke to us asking about food quality and all. They are still in process of adding more food items so looking forward to trying even more variety they have to offer. 
From appetizers to dinner to dessert, we enjoyed every bite. We highly recommend this place to everyone wanting great Indian food."}
