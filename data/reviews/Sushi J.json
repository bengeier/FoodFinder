{"text":"Its pretty good for a non-Japanese owned Japanese restaurant(note i am Japanese).  I will come again. I advised them to start offering ramen and curry for lunch. We will see..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Sashimi slices are generous!!  Service is great!  My new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this sushi joint. Not extremely fancy as some sushi joints can be, which is nice. The fish is so fresh and tasty. They have \"happy day\" instead of \"happy hour\" so you can get special deals on drinks and rolls ALL day long. Their happy day rolls are also really graciously sized unlike some happy hours where they just cut the roll in half for half the price. Not really a deal if you ask me. Really great service as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here on a very high recommendation from a friend who owns THE top restaurants in Scottsdale (Posh!) and Sushi J kicked ass.  I value freshness, presentation and a chef that knows how to bring out the flavors in the fish.  Everything was spot-on and I heavily recommend it if you're a fan of sashimi and nigiri.  It doesn't have the \"ooontz ooontz ooontz\" of most other sushi joints trying to moonlight as a dance club, which is a HUGE plus.  Sushi should be about the fish, the chef and preparation.  And Sushi J is."}
{"text":"Wow!...what a treat it was to eat here this evening ...very fresh...great service...nicely decorated...fairly priced...can't ask for more..."}
{"text":"Went there last night. The service was great fast and friendly,  what more could you ask for.  I ordered the Las Vegas roll which was very good, California Roll which was good and fresh and the tootsie roll which was also excellent.   The best part was the prices, the Happy Day special makes it a very affordable and quality Sushi place in the Old Town area.   Highly recommend to anyone who is a Scottsdale local who wants affordable but very good Sushi."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi bar. Great rolls. Our favorite is the monster roll and fire in your mouth. Generous cuts of sashimi. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Blown away today. The fish was fantastic. The Marilyn Mon roll was delicious. I regularly dine at high end places in LA and Chicago and the food quality matched any of them. The ambiance was fine - simple, not high end, certainly not trendy. Exceptional value for price. Fantastic service."}
{"text":"I came here directly from the airport. Due to a flight delay, I ended up arriving 2 minutes before closing. The hostess was very accommodating. She told me it's closing time, but I can still order food to go. I ordered the Monster and the Scottsdale rolls. They were both excellent. Would like to come back here again and try other rolls. They're located in a strip mall so parking is convenient and plenty."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Scottsdale!  No need to ever go to Stingray again!  Especially since it is walking distance from my home!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Scottsdale the fish was fresh. Service was great.  Best sashimi in Arizona."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant i have never eat before.The music over there is good.And the roll combinations are unique I am never feel bad.Amount of the vegetable and fruits mix together is the most delicious food in the world?i like it"}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi experience I've had till date. I ordered a California roll which the first time they made, was so chewy that it was unbeatable. The second time they made it , there was a rock in it. I also got a half order of tempura which they charged me full price for. And charged me for something else as well. I will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Sushi J , I always have a good dining experience . The fish is very fresh and high quality. The Shy guy roll and monster roll are my favorite rolls.  The Sashimi combo is really a good deal. Once a while I order their specials on the special board, like blue fin toro , the chef will ask if you like to flame it, I always choose flaming it, the toro is the best part of the fish like filet mignon, flaming is the best way to enjoy it! Recently they added ramen noodles, the char siu pork is so tender and juicy and the broth is so flavorful. I also enjoyed their thoughtful service. I think it is the best sushi restaurant  in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Amazing service, quick ticket times, and reasonable prices. Food was on point and I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Such a great experience. The employees are all so nice! And lovely place, not to mention the unbelievably delicious food!"}
{"text":"I've only had Salmon (Sake) this good in one other place in CA where we live. J brings in this fish from Scotland!  It is the absolute BEST!  It melts in your mouth like butter!  We also had the Eel roll which was very tasty. My wife had the Ahi Ahi Tartar which had a fantastic flavor as well. The people that live in or around Scottsdale are lucky to have such a great sushi restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi joint in AZ. The fish is as quality and fresh as any high end restaurant in the valley, except the portion sizes here are much larger than any of those high end places.  what distinguishes this place from other restaurants in general is the food and people. The staff is awesome and J is a great guy. The food is prepared with pride and I've never been disappointed.  I feel like this place should be kept a secret it's so good. Highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food.  Their location is at the back of a shopping mall and difficult to find but worth it.  They will be in a new location adjacent to sprouts in September."}
{"text":"Super delicious. We had the Dragon Roll, Vegas Roll and Tootzy Roll for our entree. Stuffed jalepenos for appetizer. I would highly recommend any of the above. Staff was friendly and food came out quick."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I have tried. I travel a lot and always try Sushi in every city. Huge pieces of fresh fish on the nigiri with a small, perfect amount of rice. Try the special wasabi. It is amazing. It's not only the fresh sushi that makes this place great. It's the personal touch and friendly chef and staff. The only place I will try when in Phoenix. Was in the Phoenix area in June and ate at another 4.5 star place that was less than stellar. If you like fresh well prepared sushi with great service, SushiJ is a must try."}
{"text":"it was worst sushi dining experience i ever had. yellowtail was looks like it was there for few days and sushi rice was so mush which it means that it is very old. slow bad service and old fishy sushi they are serving. i will warns everyone, you will have high chance to get food poison eating place like this one"}
{"text":"BEST sushi in Scottsdale! If you like salmon, make sure you try the Love Me Salmon roll (not on the menu) I also love the sea bass sushi and tempura udon. Sushi J is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"When you thinking of the greatest basketball player you think MJ  When you think of the great morning drink you think OJ   When you think of the greatest oral activity you think B....(you know where I'm going with that)   But when your in the mood you got to go to the greatest and that's Sushi J   I looked at the menu and I was like I really WANNA have some white rice   Then I was like I really WANNA have  A Las Vegas roll  Finally I was like I WANNA put back 8 rum and cokes like Johnny Depp from pirates of the Caribbean   All I know is if you WANNA have something you must have the best waitress ever Wanna( thanks for an incredible experience)"}
{"text":"Sushi is sub par and doesn't taste very fresh. Service was decent. I probably won't be returning As there are better sushi places in scottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a scattered amount of times over the past several years and always enjoyed the sushi. Our mediocre but pricey meal last night left us both feeling sick and vomiting all night.   I don't want Sushi J to do poorly- wish they would turn the ship around. The quality of sushi wasn't good, the rice didn't particularly taste good. The atmosphere needs an update at well. $6 tekka maki? Everything seems at least a dollar over priced for unremarkable sushi.   After falling ill, I'm not sure I'd return unless the restaurant got overhauled."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. Waitress kept forgetting our order. Didn't bring us water and it took us so long to get our food that we had to complain to management. The sushi is delicious but is it worth the frustration..probably not :/"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Something as simple as salmon nigiri is amazing here. Great staff. Look forward to the new location they're moving too."}
{"text":"I love sushi so I basically tried most suhi places in the valley and this is the ONE!!!  The fish is fresh and thick cut, you won't see this kind of sushi anywhere else.  Also, I absolutely LOVED the torched yellowtail, white tuna, and blue fin tuna.  So thick and juicy, just pure yumminess.  And if you like spicy, the Fire in the Mouth roll is awesome.  If you're a true sushi eater, sit and the bar and ask for the special that day.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so surprised that this was rated so high because my experience was pretty poor.   I went here for dinner specifically because the Yelp ratings were high. Quite honestly it was one of the worst sushi rolls restaurants that I've ever been to and is a one star restaurant.  Service was average and food was poor.  I don't usually review anything on Yelp but this was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had!  Service was great (although we dined late and it was not packed) and food came quickly.  I would make the trek from Mesa to go again!  Also agree with Lindsey F, very eclectic mix of 90's and 00's music, which we enjoyed."}
{"text":"The sashimi was too thick, the salmon skin roll was very salty and after dissecting the skin roll, it was not fresh and looks to be sitting out awhile."}
{"text":"So, a lot of people are doing the \"sushi\" thing now as a trend or what have you. With that said, the quality of sushi has restuarants overall has gone downs significantly. I've had sushi all over the world and I must say, Sushi J is one of the best sushi joints in the states that I've been to.   The fish is so fresh. You don't need a drop of sauce; the flavor is totally there. Since discovering this little gem, we have to hold ourselves back from going TOO often for the sake of our pocket book ;)"}
{"text":"We were just looking to satisfy our late night sushi craving and ordered the candy cane roll. It was amazing!! All the fish used were very fresh.  The chef/owner was friendly and encouraged us to not hesitate to ask for special requests.  The staff was very attentive and friendly which made for impeccable service .  We will be returning!  Ps went with my food snob fiancé."}
{"text":"We have been to sushi restaurants all over from Glendale, Tucson, Chandler , Gilbert, Scottsdale and Phoenix, not to mention we are from Los Angeles.  This is one of the best sushi places in AZ.  The nigiri IS the best, very fresh and buttery!!.....Sushi J is really awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food experience. Extremely authentic sushi that is flown in from around the world in less than 24 hours. Make sure to ask for \"fresh wasabi\""}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over 9 months due to my wife being pregnant and this place is still as good as I remember. Still hands down the best sushi place in Arizona.   What's great about this place is that they have items off their normal printed menu and on their specials chalkboard menu. I highly recommend asking your server or scoping out the chalkboard menu in the corner.  They have great items on there such as their Aji aka Spanish Mackerel,  fresh grilled scallop, Japanese Tai Snapper and Blue Fin Toro (tuna belly - get this one seared).   The quality and pricing is hands down the best anywhere if you are truly a sushi fan."}
{"text":"Well, you have to give this restaurant a try. I believe it is absolutely the best sushi place in town. Everything is fresh, never  frozen. Jay is the sushi chef and is glad to explain the different offerings. The Sea Urchin was incredible (tasted like oysters). Others around us how disappointed they had been with this entry in other restaurants, and how much they enjoyed it here. The service was fast and friendly, everyone who works here is upbeat. Very clean too. We are so lucky to have such an outstanding sushi restaurant in our neighborhood. Thank you Jay!"}
{"text":"Great service and local place to try! I highly recommend the monster roll #bonjourberlin"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Best sushi in Scottsdale. Jay the owner really takes pride in the quality if the fish. Some of the best yellowtail I have had I. A long time. The mixed tempura a must!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a couple of Kyoto employees, so we decided to give it a try for lunch.  The food was delicious and the service was outstanding! Save room for the Mochi!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the chef buying produce from Sprouts, so I had to try this place. Competent wait staff and looks a lot better on the inside them the outside (with Asian places, then you know it's good ) Miso soup was a nice starter and the Spicy Salmon roll was delicious. As was the California roll, and Shrimp Tempura roll. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Started with the complimentary Miso soup and salad. Good.  Then...the absolute highlight of the meal...The salmon Toro nigiri was fantastic. Super buttery. Melt in your mouth delicious. I will order that every time we come to Sushi J.   The Marilyn Mon-roll was just ok. However, the Prince of Persia roll was full of flavor and really good.  The Scotty Roll (soft shell crab) was really  good.  The service was excellent. Prompt. Our server, Kevin, was very knowledgeable and provided excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"I love the \"Fire In The Mouth\" roll with jalapenos (also tried the Marilyn Mon-roll which was good as well and comes with a rice wrapper instead of rice and seaweed if I recall so it's a \"lower carb\" option.)   + They have a nice small sized house salad with wasabi in the dressing.  + At lunch they gave me a free miso soup.  + They sell Asahi Dark which is one of my favorite beers and you rarely see it.  + Friendly staff.  + Very conveniently located near a Sprouts health food grocery store so you can run other errands and they probably get some of their produce fresh from there.  + The low carb sushi rice wrapper idea is inventive.  I live near Japantown in San Francisco and I can tell you that this place is very good.   I tried Bei (also near Scottsdale) a few months ago and didn't like it as much but I think they'll probably do ok because they seem to appeal to a younger crowd that just doesn't know any better.    When I travel outside of San Francisco/Japantown I miss eating Japanese food and I always try the local places but usually end up disappointed. I find that most Japanese places outside of major urban areas are not that great...for instance, I ate at 3 Japanese places outside of Baltimore, MD last month and none of them were very good.   In short, if you are visiting Scottsdale from a big city and you are missing good Japanese food you will like Sushi J. Dinnertime seems popular but lunchtime is more quiet and slower if you don't like crowds - the restaurant is a nice cool dark break from the heat outside."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously awesome! Me and my wife just ate here and were blown away. I was skeptical at first because I am from the Pacific NW where seafood is as fresh as it gets, but Sushi J is leaps and bounds better than any other sushi establishment in Arizona. This place is über fresh and tasty. In addition to quality, this place offers quantity. The cuts are so generous and prices are so cheap, I really do not know how this guy makes a profit. Me and my wife are definitely going to become regulars."}
{"text":"Straight up, no frills, well-executed, well-run and served, sushi. I visited on a Thursday night and it was decently busy, so that was a good sign. The ambiance was quiet and the decor was straightforward, nothing too crazy to report on those fronts. I ordered a couple of my go to sushi rolls: a spicy tuna roll, a salmon roll, and something pretty adventurous, a roll topped with scallops, crab salad, mushrooms, and misago. It was excellent! Pricing was about what you'd expect, about 15 dollars a person to get full on sushi alone. Definitely check this tasty place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Ok sushi. BAD services. Been to this place couple of times and since it's close to my place and the sushi was pretty good most times I gave it few tries. still its not worth the service! Poor costume service that start with waitress that are hard to understand and not really know to explain the menu when a question pops. Beside that I've never seen a place that is so cheap about the spicy mayo. You can clearly notice that spicy mayo here is really hard to get at the amount desire and if you ask for more they will make you feel uncomfortable- experience that each visit here. The worst case with this spicy mayo scenario was when I got 2 rolls to go and ask for an extra spicy mayo on top of the one they have already put at the box guess what happen they just max the same spicy mayo little jar that already was inside! Thats definitely ruined the experience . Big time! Yet I didn't mind the spicy mayo thing as long as I get my food and leave pretty quick when I have a busy day. Last visit here after long time I haven't visit when clearly I'm a return costume the owner is always greats me when I come and I usually order appetizer, one or two rolls and mucchi ice cream for dessert still it didn't make them think that's enough to wave off a roll I accidentally order off my check - a roll that and didn't eat. Deeply offended:(  You probably guess this time I didn't stay and order my favorite mucchi ice cream. All I can say is: SAVE A PENNY LOSE A DOLLAR"}
{"text":"The monster roll and salmon skin roll are both amazing. The service is great, especially David. He is attentive, polite and knowledgeable. We'll be back just for him."}
{"text":"My second time here at Sushi J ... absolutely wonderful .. food is amazing; fresh and impeccably prepared.  Service is so personable and Maggie is delightful.  A MUST GO .. saki, beer and cocktails make it an awesome accompaniment to the meal."}
{"text":"Unbelievable sushi and rolls and a great price!  Calm easy atmosphere and super nice staff.   I eat here every time I am in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I come to sushi J extremely often. We both moved here from Southern California. We love sushi and are very picky about it. This place is consistent and great. We go in and always get the happy day rolls. The roll is 5 pieces but they are big. Definitely getting more than your money's worth. Food is quick. Service is ok. We don't really go there for the service. It's more the fact that the sushi is great and we go at least once every week to 10 days :) two thumbs up..best we have had so far in Phoenix!!   - The Kreiders"}
{"text":"I'm from Hinsdale, IL just outside Chicago.  We have great sushi.  This place could easily be one of the best in the Chicago area.   We had Ahi Ahi Tartare:  a taste extravaganza, great combo of ingredients with just the right amount of seasoning.  When you get there, it's worth reading the menu for this item. The Marylin Monroll, you'll think it may be pricey but believe me well worth indulging your taste buds.  These 2 items were premium selections, $12.99. On the budget side, they have several rolls in the $3.5-$5 range that indicate only 5 pieces.  We had the Spicy Tuna, the Tootzy and Crunchy Cali.  Don't be deceived about the 5 piece serving, these are not your typical super market rolls, they're huge easily the equivalent to 50% larger.  Then there's the taste.  OMG.  Everything is real fresh, combination of ingredients is killer. We also shared a bottle of perfectly drinkable pinot grigio from Washington for $24, good value.   Service was great.  We had Mei Qi as our server on a Sunday night about 6pm as the place was filling up.  Did I mention she was great. I was in town with my wife on business.  I'll have to make the effort to create more work in the area just to be able to come back for an extraordinary dining experience.      Bobby C"}
{"text":"I don't get on Yelp to rip people, especially when most people do usually after only trying a place once but when they are good I definitely like to let people know.... I'll keep it simple , all the staff were great, totally friendly and did an awesome job. As for the Sushi, I'm not a pro but tasted very fresh and thoroughly enjoyed it.. we tried several different rolls and all were very good..... I think one was called the Fire Mouth and  they were delicious .... Want good sushi and service, check it out"}
{"text":"We have been to Sushi J several times and have consistently had good experiences. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. The staff is always friendly and prompt as well. I would highly recommended."}
{"text":"Update: second time at Sushi J. Much better than first! Took the whole family this time. The wait staff was excellent, our little \"monsters\" can be a handful for everyone. I took the Monday Night Football suggestion of the \"Cardinals Roll\" and it was a FANTASTIC surprise! We loved it! Also, I re-ordered my standard Philly Roll and was wonderfully surprised that the cream cheese was perfect, it was standard full fat cream cheese. I know it's strange, but light cream cheese changes the whole texture of the roll.  I am extra excited to change and update this review, love this place even more now!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with my experience at Sushi J last night.  We were seated right away, the bus boy was kind and took our drink orders and after a while our waitress followed. She took the orders of half our table and put her book away, thanked us for our order and I reminded her that I still needed to order.  We waited. And we waited. Finally the first of our order came out and we waited some more. It's fine that it came out a little at a time but the wait in between each was very long. I watched as people who arrived after us received full orders while I was still waiting. After 30 minutes of waiting for my last roll to arrive, I wasn't hungry anymore and wanted to cancel the last roll. Everyone around me had finished their dinners and wanted to go. I was just about to tell them nevermind when it arrived, 40 minutes after ordering. We asked what took so long and the waitress, non apologetic, told us they had a lot of take out orders. I took that to mean that all the take out orders were more important than me, who was sitting in their restaurant, waiting. She still wasn't apologetic when she said she would give us 10% off. In fact, at our complaint she seemed irritated, playing more to the idea that my satisfaction was meaningless to her as she had more important customers to tend to. In short, I will not be returning to Sushi J. If their take out orders are so important to them, perhaps they should switch to a take out only restaurant. Maybe then, in house customers won't be such an inconvenience to them."}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious. Everything on the menu is prepared in such a beautiful way and each roll is fresh. You can't go wrong here, it is a tad expensive but totally worth the price. I highly suggest the Samurai and Las Vegas. The service is a bit slow when they are really busy but besides that, definitely a delicious place for good sushi."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for business, and when I had a free minute to myself, I hit up one of my friends who happened to be stationed in Arizona for his military duties. After telling him about my lenten diet that requires me to abstain from meat and rice, we settled on Sushi J.  It was nothing short of fantastic.  Parking is easy because it's located in a plaza that wasn't even close to busy, and we were seated at the bar.  I was telling the chefs about the situation with my diet, and one had the audacity of saying, \"Don't worry.  I got you.\"  He asked what kind of fish I liked, and then proceeded to make two customized rolls for me--each of which were fantastic.  One used both hamachi and spicy tuna, with rice paper wrapping it together with some lettuce, green onion and cucumber.  The other roll was also wrapped in rice paper, and it included unagi, avocado, topped with a drop of Sriracha with something else crunchy.  They were awesome.  I haven't seen this friend in a while so we also ordered some sake bombs as well as the calamari, which was also quite tasty.  The green tea mochi ice cream was also good.  After dinner I found out that the person who made me those customized rolls was the head chef.  How crazy is that?  I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible hostess!  We arrived just after 6 to find the restaurant half-full. The hostess sat a party right before us, leaving 2 booths open. Did not acknowledge or welcome us. We anticipated to be seated in one of those, but instead were told to wait 2-3 minutes while she walked around and talked to other staff.   Finally she returned and pointed us to an area with no windows, in a corner, tightly up against an another couple. Claimed ALL other tables and booths were reserved. Come on!   We left! Won't return. If the restaurant wants to be taken serious, hire professional and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing people. David is a g-damn rockstar. GO HERE OR REGRET YOUR LIFE."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious sushi! Wonderful service - quick, responsive and very attentive. I'm from out of town in for work and found this on yelp. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have recently moved back to California and I'm still thinking about this place. This was my absolute favorite when I lived back in Scottsdale. The Monster Roll is out of this world and I hope I can find somewhere here in CA to copy. The roll is so good and full of fresh fish. I had the Marilyn Mon-Roll before I left too and it was amazing. I'm usually not a mango person but with all the reviews saying how insane it was I had to try and it was worth it. Love the staff but definitely busy at lunch so I recommend dinner mid-week. Love this place and know that when i'm back I'll be going here!"}
{"text":"As you can see the majority of ratings is very positive. There is a reason it's good food. Been there 5 times. Prices are reasonable atmosphere outstanding.  Remember if something is not good bring it to the managements attention just saying"}
{"text":"This is not a chic or trendy sushi place which made it so much better! My wife and and I had vegetable tempura, edamame, and two rolls. Everything was fresh and tasty. I really liked the cardinal roll. Good, courteous service. Happy hour went till 7 on a Friday! Not among my top tier sushi spots in Phoenix it will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not always in Phoenix/Scottsdale, but when I am, Sushi J is a regular stop!  I've been dining here since late 2014, and I've never been disappointed.  Living on the Gulf Coast and fishing as often as possible, I have a deep respect for the quality of the fish that I eat, and these landlocked artists deliver high quality fish every time!"}
{"text":"Every time I goto a sushi restaurant there are a few things I always order. Just to compare. We ordered the tempura calamari with jalapeños. It came with a spicy mayo mixed with something else in it. I would say this dish was a 3 out of 5 compared to what I've had in the past. Good but not great. It could have had more calamari and maybe a different flavored sauce to dip in The second dish was sashimi salad. This was 4 out of 5. 4 types of fish with a hearty salad We ordered the spicy tuna, this was good as usual. Kind of tough to mess this up.   My favorite was the dragon roll. Very well made. Probably the best dragon roll I've had.   Overall I really like this place And would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 100 stars! I'm not from around here so I looked up sushi places around to go eat at and this one was the closest and the ratings were good so we decided to eat here. Best choice ever! Their food is so good. It is a small little place not much room inside but it is very clean. They are reasonable as well on their prices. I was kind of scared when I got my plate because it is different at the places we go back home but it was very good!"}
{"text":"The yellowtail and salmon nigri were delicious! They were so fresh and I would definitely get again! Wasn't too crazy with the dynamite roll. The service was excellent. Food came out pretty fast too"}
{"text":"Out of towner that was craving sushi. Sushi J is right across the street from where I'm staying so convenience is an A++.    As I walked in, I was warmly greeted as I ran to the restroom which was spotless! I'm kind of weird and a bathroom can make or break a good meal/restaurant so Sushi J passed another step.   Once in my seat the service was top notice. Not too much but yet very attentive. I was pleasantly surprised by the Lunch Happy Hour with a long list of items. I'm pretty simple and started with the house salad, which was much bigger than expected, especially for HH. Very colorful with mixed greens, red peppers, tomatoes, and radishes.  The miso soup was fantastic and the avocado rolls were perfectly ripe.    Despite my simple meal, they have some really fun rolls and a great drink menu.   The rest of the restaurant looked very clean as well!  And, the sushi bar is a good size and looks pretty fun.    Overall, 5+ stars. I'll be back and do recommend Sushi J."}
{"text":"It was okay. Sorry, I am a sushi snob. Good quality fish with limited menu. Each roll and we ordered many came out separately without wasabi or ginger. WTH!?  Again, being anal. All rolls should of came out on one huge plate with a side of wasabi and ginger. In short, food was good. Price was good. Service was good. Presentation sucked."}
{"text":"J is a great Chef and had stellar recommendations. Tina was a great waitress and always made sure I had what I needed, Maggie was the sweetest of the bunch...she made sure everyone in the restaurant was happy."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the plating is exquisite.  The suhi cook here is very good. I love everything about this place"}
{"text":"Update to original rating.  Not the same quality since Jay left.  Chefs barely spoke and service was not the same.  Good thing Jay opened up Sushi Kaiyo in the same strip mall."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was unimpressed. The waitress brought us soup and salad as soon as we sat down and then was gone for like 10 minutes. No drinks. I did not try any sushi, so it could be spectacular for all I know. I had the lunch portion of Teriyaki beef, which was a good portion, but the meat was really tough. I did like the sauce, though.  We also ordered gyoza, which I liked, but the dipping sauce was off. My bf ordered the Tempura lunch, which was a good portion but again, the dipping sauce was off.   Probably would not rush back here, but I am always willing to try something more than once, because you never know!"}
{"text":"Staying in Scottsdale on business and was craving sushi, but I am pretty picky about it. So I chose this place based on the yelp reviews. I went in and it was not very crowded so I sat at the sushi bar and ended up sitting in front of Chef J himself. You could tell he really loves what he does because he was making fun rolls for customers and making stuff up as he went along. I ordered a spicy salmon roll, spicy yellowtail roll and the Friday Night Fever roll. All were great and it is great quality sushi. I would recommend this place. My only complaint would be that it was kind of a boring atmosphere, but it was only a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place while at Petco and am glad we decided to test it out. The food was incredibly fresh and delicious. Sitting in front of chef Jay was the best decision I could have made. Watching him make everyone's food helped start my list for my next visit.   Everything looked incredible. I love that they have daily specials 'happy day' instead of happy hours.   I will be back. If you are looking for a great sushi place near old Scottsdale with good prices check this place out."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years now and always exceptional service and 5 star quality you would expect at some of the best sushi bars in LA, NY and Seattle. Highly recommend going to J's"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Phoenix! The fish is as fresh as anywhere I've had on the coast. Must try if you like sushi!"}
{"text":"At the end of the day this sushi is ok. The best way to frame it up is that it wasn't great but it wasn't bad.   I started with the fire in the mouth roll and it did have a subtle hint of spice but nothing id call spicy.   I then had the Tootzy Roll off the happy day roll menu finishing with the Las Vegas roll.   I have been to a lot of sushi spots some in AZ and some not in AZ.   Will I be back, maybe. My tab for 3 rolls and miso soup was $27, which isn't bad for sushi.   For those just starting to venture down the sushi roll this is probably up your ally."}
{"text":"Uber Fresh and Delish!  I always sit at the bar and talk to the owner. If the fish isnt fresh, they dont have it. Uni is from Santa Barbara. They get toro in usually too. They are moving locations in the same plaza.  M-Th they have happy hour all day"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local sushi spots. Low key, unpretentious; great sushi that won't break the bank and the staff is always awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"we really enjoyed our first visit to Sushi J.  food and service was really great!   decor is far from hip and trendy but the food and service makes up for the atmosphere.   they have a nice selection of food, the quality of their sushi is excellent and the pricing is incredibly reasonable for the quality and quantity you get  (our party of 5 had drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 teriyaki entrees, 4 specialty rolls for less than $80 before tip).   their portions are big especially the monster roll (delicious and huge!).   if you want a great meal with super nice service and excellent food come here."}
{"text":"Definitely just mediocre.  I asked to substitute real crab for the fake mix stuff in a few rolls and it was $5 PER ROLL.  I've had a $1-2 up charge for real crab but never something as obscene as $5. That made an already overpriced $13 roll nearly $20. And it wasn't very good at all. I have no intention of going back, which is too bad given its nearby and I've gone there for years whenever I'm in town.  Definitely prefer RA Sushi or Geisha A Go Go to this place."}
{"text":"A long-time favorite, Sushi-J has undergone quite significant changes lately.  Throughout at least the first six months of 2017, the quality of the sushi has diminished significantly, its presentation is remarkably inconsistent -- highly variable portion sizes prepared, seemingly, by inexperienced sushi chefs, and service is very hit-and-miss.  No longer a place I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Love love... this place. I don't usually review for a restaurant cause I am lazy. However, this place is worth a five star. I don't need to say much.. real crab and fresh sushi said it all. I HATE FAKE CRAB STICK. No matter how famous is a sushi restaurant as soon as they have the crab stick that is nasty.."}
{"text":"The sushi here was pretty good and the service was kinda meh. I think this restaurant's strong suit is it's special rolls, they are very unique and pretty good. When ever I go to a new sushi spot usually get a tuna roll in addition to a specialty roll. I was very disappointed by the tuna roll.   I'm not sure if they were under staffed or just a little swamped but we waited a long time in between visits from our waitress which was kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely floored by this place.  Living in LA my whole life, I've sort of come to expect a certain caliber of sushi joint.  I've been lucky enough to experience good sushi around the world as well.  So when somebody at the hotel happy hour told me about Sushi J's, I was sort of thinking \"yeah right.  400 miles from an ocean, I'm sure it's great.\"  But the Yelp reviews seemed encouraging so I decided to check it out.  HOLY COW!  The fish was fresher than most of the placed I go in Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, etc.  Places that are spittind distance to the LA Fish Market.  The service was outstanding as well.   Now I'm not a guy who orders a roll that \"looks cool.\" I order sashimi off the special board and have fairly high expectations.  A cute name on  a roll is NOT going to win me over, but yellow tail toro so fresh it was probably swimming early this afternoon surely does.    Over the past decade or so, I've had some decent sushi in the Phoenix area, don't get me wrong.  But this place is in the top 5 I've ever eaten at world wide.  San Fran, LA, NY, Chicago, etc.    Yeah, I'm still high on my sushi buzz and you can be too.  I just really hope I can find an excuse to get back to Scottsdale soon to eat hear again."}
{"text":"Came here Thursday morning, watching the chefs preparing special blue fin tuna. Order couple of bluefin sushi and sashimi, they taste fresh and yum! Excellent service by the way. The server told me that the happy hour is available for lunch time too. Definitely come back next time!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because it was Valentine's Day, although it was only 5:30 PM, but something has changed dramatically at this place.  It was a complete and total mess.  The majority of the food didn't arrive and what did was the wrong order.  The waitress who said she was new, repeatedly, had no idea at all what dish she was delivering, no idea of types of what different sushi looked like and was just lost.  Three different employees couldn't get the bill together.  It took 14 minutes standing at the cashier waiting for them to figure out how to total the bill.  I finally said, \"I'll add the correct items that were actually delivered, I'll show you the correct total and pay it in cash to end this nightmare.\" It was a complete uncoordinated mess.   It was so bad, it seemed like a Saturday Night Live sketch where no one working there had any idea what they were doing or what they were serving.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Very good Rolls and friendly people , asked to turn airco lower and they did . I Will come back for sure ."}
{"text":"Friendly, good service, ordered salmon skin roll, spider roll-both very good. Salmon sushi was fresh and huge pieces, rice good consistency. Nice atmosphere, good product. Here on business, but will visit this place again."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had!! The shrimp tempura is amazing! When we  ordered the shrimp for our appetizer they said it would be a bit cause they just changed the oil for the fryers. As soon as they told me they were changing the oil my 1st thought was take all the time with something like that. So we made our dinner order and everything came out together which wasn't a big deal cause didn't take very long at all. The sushi was amazing some of the best I've ever had. I had a monster roll and the spider roll. I was sad when it was gone but full and extremely satisfied! The shrimp tempura was so perfect and the sauce it comes with is awesome! My fiancé doesn't like sushi so she had the combination fried rice which fresh and so delicious! When it came to pay they brought us out some green tea ice cream on the house cause of the wait for the appetizer which again wasn't a big deal. They were so friendly there and awesome! It's a small drive for me to get to but definitely my go to sushi place now!"}
{"text":"Went here two nights ago, it was our first time. Staff was very attentive. My favorite roll was one of their we love salmon roll, I believe that is the name. We also have salmon nigiri ( cannot go wrong), tuna and mango roll, and one other I am forgetting. It was all very good. It was delicious and hit the spot. We will be dining there again"}
{"text":"This is an easy review to write. Good clean fresh sushi. They use real crab meat in all rolls. Pricing is on point. The location is moving to the other side of the street toward the end of the year. Service is great and all the fish was on point. I had the ahi sashimi, the salmon nigiri, and the fire mouth roll. Exquisite!!! Must try sushi place!!!! Ask for the pickled wasabi mix."}
{"text":"Blah. Blah. Blah. Holy shit! $13 for that? and $17 for this? Hmmm... I think its cheaper to go across the street to Safeway... Might be better quality also, just saying think about it"}
{"text":"The best sushi place I've been to in Scottsdale. An amazing staff, nice music and atmosphere. I will definitely be a return customer. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The sushi was great. A little slow with only two servers working but if you sit at the bar you can order straight from the person making it. Recommend if you go shopping at fashion square because it's just a few minutes away. Really great food!!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best sushi place in Scottsdale. It is my third time here and I'm never disappointed. The service is impeccable, the food comes out fast and is good quality, and I am always full when I leave. I would highly recommend this restaurant for sushi lovers. And if you don't like sushi they have great non sushi options like an amazing chicken teriyaki and stuffed jalapeños!"}
{"text":"So fresh! This is my new favorite spot for sushi. The roll combinations are unique and I am yet to be disappointed. Highly recommend the Prince of Persia. It has just the right amount of crunch and fresh tuna. I love that they don't have BS rolls with cream cheese that are ultra deep fried. Only the real deal. The size of the special rolls are massive as well. You will get plenty full here.   The prices are very reasonable as well, even when you go Fri-Sat when \"Happy Day\" prices are not valid. Ended up getting 3 rolls and an appetizer to share for around 45 bucks. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Yelpers do it again...  The positive reviews are warranted.  Service was great and they have a great selection of rolls.  Booth seating is comfortable and provides ample room to surreptitiously unbutton the top button of your pants."}
{"text":"This place has quickly became one of our favorite places to go. If you have the opportunity to come here then make sure to get David as your server. He goes above and beyond to make sure that the customer is satisfied and does so while making the customer smile. Every time we come here, David is so kind and loves showing us what the best sushi to enjoy is. He makes sure that we try new things and makes sure that we get the best. Both David and the owner Maggie are super kind and have passion for what they do. This place can quickly become like home as everyone is so Inviting. The drinks are good and the food is spectacular. Thank you sushi j for being a great place to eat and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in, for lunch, earlier this week.  Service is very cordial and server very knowledgeable about the complete menu.  The tuna tartare is superb and is served with a complimentary miso soup and small house salad.  Along with a very decent Oregon Pinot Noir, that constituted my lunch and I was, indeed, very well satisfied.  This is a very good place and, lucky me, it's only .3 of a mile, from my house."}
{"text":"Looking at the outside of the building, you would not expect the quality of sushi you're served inside. So far we had the j rolls, dragon and geisha rolls. Although they are a little on the pricy side, you'll get a lot for your money.  The rolls are almost twice the size of other places and really delicious. The service was very attentive and authentic with Japanese servers. It's a good place and we'll go there again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the service.  Located in the heart of old town Scottsdale this is just a hop and a skip away from your favorite party spot.   My girlfriend had the fried rice, she enjoyed it. I had the Vegas rolls and was very impressed. Definitely will go back when I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing!! Stop by and try. You won't regret it. Happy hour every Monday. Service is amazing.   Clean-10 Speed-9 Taste-9 Innovation-8"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Scottsdale and want great sushi, get off the beaten path and go to Sushi J. Fabulous and friendly servers and the fish is beyond the freshest sushi I have ever had. The building looks questionable from the exterior but don't let that or the TJ Maxx and petco next door scare you off. I highly recommend Sushi J. My husband and I love sushi and we left so happy. Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly service. Get the Monster roll- amazing and they don't go shy on the fish! They have 30% off dinner and 20% off for the grand opening. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When we were looking for a place to eat we found sushi J. Looking on the outside it is honestly not very welcoming it looks dark in the building is old and I particularly don't like the red car parked on the side of the restaurant. Sitting inside at the sushi bar you can see the red car, probably the owners car parked right outside the restaurant. I thought this was a little tacky. However food and service definitely made up for it. J, Who is the owner of the restaurant is actually the sushi chef behind the bar. She really put his personal touch on all of our roles and sushi. We ordered over $150 worth of sushi and it was really really amazing. I especially liked the eel and scallops sushi that we ate. Also the service was outstanding. Are we just stopped by multiple times to check on if we needed a refill.The waitress even asked my friend if she needed a drink refreshed. Who asks if someone wants to refresh their soda half way through?   I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ONE THING, although small touch. ..Amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Their udon and sushi is amazing. So sad the place across the street opened because the atmosphere is so much better there. But the food/ menu here is better than theirs."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday tonight and it was amazing! They definitely took care of my parents and me. I mentioned it was my birthday and they did the best to accommodate me. The food was super fresh and filling! The green tea ice cream was delicious as well! Come here if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"J is not here! This place is trying to sponge off his good name. Bad service and poor food management. He's across the parking lot at his new restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi we've ever had! A real neighborhood find and favorite! I had the Monster Roll and my wife had her usual California Roll. Both were great. Place was packed on Saturday night so that's always a good sign."}
{"text":"We just got out of Sushi J, the nigiri were well done, the staff was nice. However I'd say the rolls were not made with much \"love\". Overall, not bad but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"I got extremely excited when I saw that Sushi J was opening as I live less than a mile away and am always looking for new sushi restaurants. I went in with low expectations because the old sushi restaurant that used to be there was pretty mediocre, but I was quickly blown away by my very first bite!  I came with a friend and we sat at the bar and started to chat with J the owner and head sushi chef. I put our order in his hands and he served us Suzuki (sea bass), Hamachi belly (yellow tail belly), and Big Eye tuna nigiri. Each piece was absolutely delicious. This was the first time I had Suzuki and it was so flavorful and went perfectly with the ponzu he brushed it with. Yellow tail belly was served slightly torched, and was rich and melted in my mouth. Fish pieces were very generous and were in perfect proportion to the rice. Rice was also perfectly seasoned (I am very picky about my sushi rice!) Then we ordered the Lord of Tuna roll which was wonderful and had an interesting twist with some mango included inside. Loved the tuna tataki served on top of the roll.   I had accidentally left my credit card there and decided that it was a good enough excuse to come back the very next day.......for yet another sushi dinner! This time I ordered the Fire in the Mouth roll - spicy tuna inside topped with hamachi and jalapeno. I loved how spicy it was, and the combo of tuna and hamachi. I also ordered the scallop nigiri (one of my very favorites) and it was wonderfully flavorful and fresh. I also ordered some hamachi and salmon pieces, again very large, fresh cuts that melted in my mouth.  Service was excellent, and it was great to be able to talk to J and watch him make his beautiful creations. Freshest fish I've found in Scottsdale so far. Only thing that would make this place better in my mind is if the atmosphere were a bit more lively or trendy. But still, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Blue fin toro...yup!  I have not found another sushi restaurant in old town Scottsdale that has it!  It's not just the cuts either.  The chef has been one of my favorite sushi chefs since I have moved here 3 years ago. Formerly working at another very popular sushi restaurant north of their current location.  J has been so successful that he opened his own restaurant due to a great fan base and superb sushi.    I would recommend this sushi restaurant over any other sushi restaurant in Scottsdale just for the quality of the food and cuts.  If your looking for a sushi restaurant that is yuppie and pretentious there are others to choose from and way more over priced.  But here, you really do get the Japanese food experience.    I give J 5 stars for their outstanding sushi, sashimi and other great dishes.  If you can't find the restaurant it means you have never been here and do not live here all year round!  So follow the map and come in.  Your welcome!"}
{"text":"We came in tonight and based on recommendations on Yelp.  What a mistake.   We ordered one eel tempura roll, two spicy tuna rolls, and two salmon rolls along with Miso soup.  We asked the waitress if the tuna and salmon rolls were made with raw fish.  She said yes.  The salmon rolls came with mostly fake crab mixed with Mayo, gross.  The eel roll was 90% fake crab with Mayo, gross.  The fake crab was not described as part of these rolls.  We sent the salmon/fake crab roll back.  The eel one we dumped.  The spicy tuna was fine but wonder what they put in it.  We live a few blocks from the place and will never return."}
{"text":"I like sushi at least a couple times a month and have lived near old town almost 10 years.  RA, Geisha, Kyoto, Stingray (when it was open), are all places I've been countless times.    I think this will be my new spot if I am going out primarily for the food.  The service is really good and the food quality is great and it's one of the more authentic Japanese restaurants in the area (actual Japanese people work here which is rare in Scottsdale).  We loved the Udon soup - the broth was excellent.  I hope some day to see Ramen on the menu.  Also, the sashimi salad was really good and tons of Sashinmi and all fresh.     Pros: mostly Japanese staff that are attentive and good service Great parking - next to Sprouts parking plaza; always can park right out front Cool atmosphere - I like that it's not too small and not too big Nice menu and what I've eaten so far - delicious and fresh"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi I have ever had. We got take out from here tonight and tried three rolls, seaweed salad and miso soup. The rolls we had were the monster roll, which was put together very poorly and was falling apart, fish was cut uneven and it was only 5 pieces for $15!!!!!! I was appalled at this! We had two other rolls as well both tempura fried, disgusting, small cold shrimp and black salmon not cooked properly at all. I could not believe this place had such great reviews. Yelp completely steered me wrong on this one. I wish I could take this experience back, but I hope I can help others to not go here. This place is disgusting, this food was horrible and I would advise people to go anywhere else for sushi."}
{"text":"Was looking for sushi after visiting a relative in the hospital. I live in Vegas. Managed to run into Sushi J. Amen!!  Not only were they open late, but service was great--even for a to-go order. Ordered Sashimi and a roll and the food was amazing. Will def. come back when I'm on the area. Thank you Sushi J!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!  My personal favorite is the monster roll. I get takeout from here like every week :)  I recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Prompt service is the first thing that comes to me. I walked in alone and was instantly greeted when I walked in , the ambiance is a little dark and dingy, but the delightful staff makes up for the lack of decor. My order was very straightforward , spicy tuna roll, and miso soup. Two staples that I think put a restaurant to the test, and I think they passed with flying colors. Fresh ingredients, substantial portions, frequent water refills, and happy staff."}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of sushi place here in the Scottsdale area and this is my favorite! Friendly staff, fresh sushi. Coming from Seattle I was a little cautious on the seafood, but this place is great."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE sushi spot in Scottsdale!  Bold statement I know. The fish is so fresh. The service is always outstanding.   Monster roll - Nom! Candy Cane - fresher option and Nom!   The other notable point is their sashimi and nigiri is always wonderful portions. They don't skimp.   A must stop! - heads up there are two sushi joints in the same plaza so make sure you are at sushi J not the other one."}
{"text":"Sure Sushi is usually expensive but holly crap it's still so expensive even tho we were here during happy hour.... pricy, yet not satisfying. Three stars still for good service and having daily special menu  We got jalapeño bomb, spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, salmon toro/yellow tail toro nigiri and scallop nigiri. I also had mojito happy hour price.   Unfortunately our best item was jalapeño bomb and mojito... that's really sad for a sushi restaurant.   toro tastes like normal cut of fish, scallop doesn't taste as fresh as the one we bought straight from mitsuwa supermarket or chula seafood but quiet slimy and tasteless. We usually get the set of simple spicy tuna/salmon to grade sushi restaurants new to us, quiet disappointed as they were loaded with rice probably 75% of the rolls."}
{"text":"People who don't know the area may go to the other Sushi restaurant across the street and may be convinced this quiet treasure isn't open. That would be their loss! Sit at the Sushi Bar and get a roll by Martin and you won't be disappointed! Maniacal about the quality of their fish, they throw something away before risking that someone will get something past its time. A great find in Old Town!"}
{"text":"The servers were great.  However, I found it pretty tacky that they tried to offer us $10 off our next visit for a good Yelp review that we had to show to the waiter to receive the gift card.  Ok sushi but I'm pretty sure I got sick from it...guess that's why you don't eat raw fish in the desert!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and the food was absolutely the best in Scottsdale!!  The Sushi was fresh and delish.  Service was great too!!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here, I would highly recommend!!! David best server ever.  I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a new place."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. The sushi was very disappointing and very expensive. Definitely not worth the price at all. I felt like I paid for premium sushi and got something you would find at a cheap revolving sushi place. The rolls looked haphazardly prepared and the soft shelled crab was mushy in the middle. The shrimp tempura was mostly flour. All the rolls seemed drenched in sauce. The setting are dark and uncomfortable and two of our family members got bit by bugs while sitting there.  Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Working in the area and found this Sushi place. Very good fish was fresh, sushi chefs were very friendly and made sure and asked how was everything."}
{"text":"First of all, the music here is on point. They play everything that makes my little 90s/00s heart happy.  Its the same playlist every time I'm in, but where else can I consistently hear LFO non ironically?!   I tend to get the same 3 or 4 rolls every time I'm here but why mess with a good thing. I love their tootzy, crunchy bay, and dynamite rolls.   I will say this has been the only one of a few sushi places where I haven't liked their variation of the Las Vegas roll. Too smoky. Ah well..you win some, you lose some.    Every 4 or 5 times Im in they will be severely understaffed with one waiter taking care of every table in the place,  otherwise Ive always had great service.   I've been here numerous times and as its within walking distance of my home and I predict many more delicious dinners between SJ and myself."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ. I eat a lot of sushi and the fresh and original taste here can't be beat, especially for the price. I love to sit at the sushi bar and do Omakase - letting Chef J really show his skills and in my opinion it's the best way to taste the rainbow and try things you never had before."}
{"text":"New management (has no clue) used to be very good - tonight's service was well below expectations. We ordered ebi-they didn't have it. We also ordered edamame, squid salad, octopus sashimi, caterpillar roll and spicy tuna roll after being there an hour we still hadn't received the tuna roll -and gave up and left. Took a while to get the check and pay it too. So sad. We really liked this place"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! You can rate a sushi restaurant by its miso soup and they for sure pass!! Love their miso and salad. Agedashi tofu is amazing!!!! Sushi portions are great too--never had such huge pieces of fish for nigiri. They are great!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were a bit hungry and decided to try Sushi J. We got here a few minutes before they close and got a superb customer service from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. The owner came by our table couples of times with a radiant smile checking on us. We ordered Spicy Salmon Roll which was delicious light fresh and good texture. The Monster roll was also spicy with a mix of Salmon, Tuna ,shrimp tempura, and surimi. We were extremely satisfy we the attention, service and food. Maggie the owner offered us a Green tea ice cream for this being our first visit, it was creamy delicious. Thank you for a great dinner I will be returning here with my friends and tell everyone of this little hidden jewel."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and I'm finally getting a chance to put in my five stars.  Great lunch specials.  It's now my go to lunch sushi place and has passed up Sakana.  Very good quality fish and J is great!"}
{"text":"You gotta be kidding me. Nobody in here Sat night Hostess/owner upselling me left and rt Plus some if the shittiest sushi ive ever had Blaaaaaah Nobody remotely a sushi CHEF"}
{"text":"Great spot and the staff is awesome!  Dragon roll was so good I came back 2 days later. They even offered complementary champagne Christmas Eve!  I will most certainly be a regular whenever I am in town!"}
{"text":"A couple of my Sushi peeps were bragging about this place and I had an opportunity to check it out.  I'm so glad they talked it up, it was very good.  Service was a little slow but I'm going to chalk that up to culteral differences since I was having a power lunch and my server was trying to keep it casual.  We tried three rolls, Philly, Spicy Tuna, and THE roll (in house specialty).  They were all thick rolls, almost to the point of being too thick, but very very good.  The Miso soup and salad were great starters as we waited for our rolls to be prepared.  Both my friend and I will be returning to enjoy this resturant again as well as my other friends!"}
{"text":"It's been a year or so since my first visit and Sushi J keeps hitting home runs.   this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best sushi I have had in Arizona. Came after work only to discover they have all day happy hour - SCORE! Had the Tootzzy Roll, Eel Tempura Roll, California Roll, and Dragon Roll. Each and every one was amazing. Everything tastes very fresh and the rolls were very large and filling.  My only downfall (and it's not costing them any stars) is that some of the non sushi items, and Sake, are a bit pricey (I.e. Seaweed salad for $5.50, large sake for $5.99). It's honestly a better deal to get one of the \"combos\" which include a large beer. I was lucky that I was with someone who wanted a beer, so that I could enjoy my large sake for an add-on price of $2.99.  To match the delicious food, the staff was also delightful. Hostess was friendly and our waiter/server was taking care of the entire restaurant but never skipped a beat to ensure everyone was well taken care of.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best sushi I've had. The salmon sashimi was unlike any other, so fresh. We ordered 4 rolls, my favorite in order - Prince of Persia, Fire in the Mouth, Lord of Tuna, Spider-Man. All super fresh and tasty, but the Prince of Persia was soooo good.   Ambience is casual and low-key. Service was great - they were attentive and friendly and despite having a party of 12 food and drinks came quickly. They were on top of it.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came at the suggestion of friend and noted Sushiphile Ryan R.  Sort of loud with a cheap karaoke bar feel but don't let the 'also ran' atmosphere dissuade you from some of the freshest and best executed Sushi in the West.Will likely gain a star with future visits."}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on reviews but the place smelled like sewage and was overpriced.  I went with recomended rolls, like the MonRoll, and have had better."}
{"text":"First time here since Dozo closed, and I find it just as good.  \"And I know good sushi,\" because I saw it on Food Network and my husband was stationed in Japan...before I ever met him.  Actually, I don't know sushi.  I just thought I would say it to see how it felt.  Not good.    In fact, I'm not a sushi lover, and there was a time I wouldn't eat it at all.  But it's grown on me.  Although I've yet to graduate to sushi rolls with raw fish as the main ingredient, I have moved to where I can handle a little tuna as long as there's some other stuff in there to hide it.  But even this non-sushi eating diner finds some good things on the menu.  My favorite roll of the night was...well I can't remember the name of it and their website is down...I think it was the shy guy or something along those lines.  And with that, I conclude this exceptionally useful review.  I guess I should take better notes, or any notes for that matter."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the area for great sushi. They have real crab! That is rare, indeed. This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's very traditional feeling on the inside. Not a overly commercialized sushi place, they stick to the basics and do it right.   Great place for a lunch with co-workers, too. Fast, fresh, good quality food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Some of the best rolls I've had and some quite unique ones.  I will always get the Fire in the Mouth roll, spicy but just right.  The stuffed jalepanos are awesome also.  Great sushi at a great price and walking distance from my place...can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Driving by this place, I thought it looked janky and probably had janky sushi. But with such a high star rating on yelp, I knew I had to be wrong. The food was quite delicious. We normally never get rolls because of all the rice, but Sushi J has 4 great no rice roll options. We had the Marilyn monroll and the Phoenix lite roll. The Marilyn was wrapped in cucumber and was so flavorful. The Phoenix was wrapped in rice wrap and was also cool and refreshing.  You don't even need soy sauce the flavors are so great. And lite doesn't mean not filling. These 2 rolls had us plenty full.  We did get a starter combo with a large kirin light and a squid salad. We exchanged it for a seaweed salad because the squid was a bit too tough and chewy.  But a great spot thanks to yelpers."}
{"text":"We sit down and look at the menu a little when the waitress asked us if we would like something to drink. I asked do you guys have pina coladas or strawberry daiquiris? She said, \"I'm not sure what's that, let me ask.\" She comes back and says no we do not. My girlfriend asked do you guys have Shirley temples? She seemed confused and had to ask her manager. Eventually she figures it out and we receiver our 2 Shirley temples. I asked the young girl what kind of vegetables are in your chicken teriyaki? She had to really think about it.  She tells me it has mushrooms, carrots, bell peppers, onions. When I get the plate of chicken teriyaki it's full of veggies and hardly any chicken. For $11.99?  what a joke. Then they charge $3.99 a piece for Shirley temples."}
{"text":"Wifey and I are regulars at Sakana...  The wait was unbearable tonight so we hit up yelp for a little nigiri udon guidance...  Yelp, you are a jedi master.  Enter Sushi J....  Wifeys Udon was.. Udon.  Kinda hard to F that up, right.?    My fish was pretty f**$% mind blowing..  Let me preface this with the \"I'm not a noob\" statement...  I've had fish from some solid joints on both sides of the country (shiro, morimoto)   Highlights of the night were the Sea Bass and Scallop.  Both were fan-F**-tastic..!  The scallops was simply sea-meat-butter... so damn good.  The blue fin was surprisingly fresh as well.  Another note on the blue fin, it was easily a 2 oz portion.  Their oysters (treasure cove, WA i think) were a perfect desert...  Oh...  I forgot to mention.... dinner was only $100..."}
{"text":"Super fun night eating here with colleagues.  Food was super fresh and tasty!  Monster roll lived up to its reviews.  Unagi was one of the best I've had, served warm and perfectly sauces.  Delilsh!  Will be back when we return for our sales meeting in January!"}
{"text":"Since our last visit, we found out that the original owner's separated, Jay is no longer there, and it isn't as fantastic as all our previous experiences. The service is still great but the quality of food has gone down hill a little. The fish quality doesn't seem as fresh and good as all the times before. My husband got food poisoning from his sushi this time, which has never happened before."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi so unique stuff that may be on specials or off the menu not from the area but every time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely stop by Jay's love this place. Very happy to support this great establishment"}
{"text":"This use to be Dozo.  The new owners gave a fresh face to place and updated the menu.  The staff is friendly and well trained.  I've been here several times.  I've tried several different rolls and everything tasted pretty good.  The nigiri sushi have a large portion of fish covering a small portion of rice like it should be at a good sushi restaurant.  The entrées looks like standard Japanese dishes like teriyaki chicken, pork cutlet, etc.  I did try the ginger calamari which I haven't seen on a Japanese menu. They use large body sections of the calamari pounded until very tender (maybe a little too tender, I like a little chew on my calamari) sautéed with onions and mushrooms in a light sauce. I couldn't taste much ginger in the sauce, but the it was pretty good and different.  I had the squid and jalapeno tempura appetizer plate.  It came on a large plate which in itself was a meal   They separate the body and legs of small squids to tempura separately.  The sliced jalapeno tempura added a nice bite to the plate.  The dipping sauce was really good and help cool your tongue from the jalapenos.  The ice tea was strange.  It was very dark colored like a strong tea, but it didn't have any taste.  It was like colored water.  Also had a diet Pepsi which was a little flat.  The Kirin beer was good.  Also the water was good.  It tasted filtered.  Some of the items on the menu have the wrong price.  For example the uni sushi is priced at $7.99 on the menu, but you're charged $8.99.  Right now they have a 30% discount for dinner.  Not sure how long it's going to last, but it's a screaming deal.  *** 7/1/16 ***  I come here about every 2 weeks.  They've fixed their ice tea.  The squid and jalapeno tempura is still good, but it's smaller portions for the same price.  Sushi hasn't changed.  It's fresh and great quality.  Fresh fish is very perishable.  You don't have to toss it, but it shouldn't be served raw once it passes several days. The fish should be sliced before you serve it.  Pre-slicing the fish starts decomposing it.  The rice is always perfect here.  I've been to other places where the rice is too soggy.  Rice is like pasta.  It should be served al dente."}
{"text":"Wife and I looking for sushi after 10 months of pregnancy and banned from anything raw we reluctantly ventured out with our five day old and found sushi j just around the corner from where we live.  I work in San Francisco and have traveled quite a bit dining at some of the best sushi restaurants in the country so know quality fish when I see and taste it. I highly recommend sushi j!!!  We had the sashimi combo which featured yellowtail, salmon, albacore, and tuna. The portions were huge and the fish extremely fresh. Some of the best I've had and definitely the best ive had in phoenix. Also had the spicy tuna handroll and a special roll simply called THE roll.  Staff very friendly and prices are reasonable. Excited about quality sushi in my hood!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale!It's tucked away in the corner of a large shopping center, so I probably wouldn't have discovered it had I not found it on Yelp...which is crazy since I can practically throw a rock to it from my apartment. The rolls are fresh and they also have a ton of yummy appetizers. I've dined in and also gotten takeout and the service is always great! I suggest the Samurai roll if you like fried rolls, but their classic rolls are great as well."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Lisa Loeb - Stay)  You say I only write what I want to You say I eat so all the time...so And I thought what I ate was simple And I thought that I should review And now that I am finished Now you hope that you did something right cause you fed me Yeah, yeah, you fed me  And you say I only write what I want to I Yelp lyricals I Yelp with intentions of dictations that you're listening or to any words, any place You don't understand if I really care But you only see positive: stars, stars, stars  At...Sushi....J   Had to cut the song short so I may review! Sorry Lisa Loeb fans but you all can finish it yourselves! Haha!  Sushi J is a little hot sushi spot located behind the scenes of Oldtown.  Sushi J provides a warm cozy welcome compared to the buzzing night scene.  I came here with a a couple of good friends.  Needless to say, I've known chef Jay for quite some times and it was good to see him again behind the sushi table.    We started with some edamame and sake bombers to wet our palates.  As for the entree we ordered the Marylin MonRoll, Geisha Roll, and the Prince of Persia.  The Marylin MonRoll came as a rice-less roll; wrapped with rice sheets and within Lobster mix, cucumbers, avocado, mango and cilantro.  Overall, reminded me of a spring roll with lobster, but a solid start since if anything I'd rather eat a rice-less roll - low carb!  The Geisha was a regular rice wrap and came with crab meat, cucumbers, shrimp tempura and topped with tuna and avocado; served with yuzu and Siracha sauce.  I would say this was my favorite of the night because I always enjoy a crunchy and spicy roll.  The Prince of Persia came with Ahi Tuna, avocado, green onion, tempura and served with ginger garlic sauce and Siracha.  Again, a crunchy and spicy roll which I love, but this one had that extra garlic aroma and bite to it.  I came back a 2nd time with a foodie friend of mines and this time we shot for the Sushi Omakase tailored to our price point.  Totally awesome!  Our omakase came with Uni roll, a spicy tuna hand roll, and a plate of sashimi.  I totally love the Uni Roll; creamy to the bite and a burst of the taste of the sea.  Our sashimi came with Yellowtail, Yellowfin Tuna, fish liver paste, tuna belly and scallops.  Overall, a solid dish and I can't say enough about each bite.  Fresh as can be and and seared to perfection!  In the end, I really enjoyed my visit to Sushi J.  I think it's one of the few better sushi joints around town and plus I live close by!  The service is good and the amount of specialty sushi is  plentiful. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to sushi but came here for a friends birthday. Yummy!!! I had the salmon sashimi, Marilyn Monroll and Dragon roll. Prices were reasonable and the service was amazing! The servers always made sure we had what we needed, they didn't make any mistakes at all with our orders and checks ( we were at least 20 in our party). Will def be back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch again with my son and am happily surprised to learn they are open more than just Fridays for lunch.  I know they are closed Sunday and Monday, but I am not sure if they are open Tuesday through Saturday for lunch.   I know they are open those days for dinner.  I had the sashimi mixed plate again with the sushi rice.   It comes with miso soup and salad.   My son ordered the mixed tempura appetizer, which I shared.   Battered, seasoned and fried to perfection.   Light and tasty as it should be.   '  He ordered the mixed nigiri, and, of course, he loved it since it was more or less the same sashimi that I had.  I was trying to guess what the salad dressing is, but it's a good mix of ingredients.   I think it has a dab of wasabi, maybe ginger, soy sauce, miso?   Don't know.   It was good though.     Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Cute place, great food, to die for sushi rolls! First class, amazingly friendly staff. Get the Eel rolls!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to sushi spot in AZ. Not sure how it took so long to go here, but have probably been 5 times in the last month. If you're into rolls, they have some of the best I've had. After coming back from LA and getting hooked on omakase after being to some awesome sushi spots, we were searching for something to fill the void. This is it. Jay serves up the best omakase in AZ and the value is insane. Sit at the sushi bar and have Jay serve you up an omakase meal. You will not regret it.   In terms of the ambiance, I am pretty sure this used to be a Wendy's or Starbucks or something as there is still a drive-through. Doesn't matter. Inside is put together well and Jay told me he's moving to another spot across the parking lot in a few months. Speaking of parking, since it's not in the middle of old town, the parking is super easy and available without having to deal with the normal old town scottsdale drama.   I'm almost hesitant to write this review, as I want this place to stay a (somewhat) hidden gem. That said, Jay is one of the nicest guys in the world and serves up the best sushi in AZ. Whether it's sushi rolls or letting Jay treat you to omakase, this place is leaps and bounds better than anywhere else we have been in AZ for sushi and we go out for sushi basically every weekend. The fact that it is lacking the usual old town snobbery is just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"New place, nice people and good service.  I had the salmon and tuna sashimi and got good large pieces.  Great value and really fresh fish.  They have some interesting \"low carb\" rolls and I tried the Marilyn Monroll based on the server recommendation but I think I will try the Friday night fever roll next time.    Lastly I had the Geisha roll with siracha on the side which was a perfect addition!  I will certainly return when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Las Vegas and found Sushi J online while searching for a sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.   For me, I like a sushi restaurant, Japanese-owned and it must serve fresh and quality seafood. Sushi J is off the beaten path imo, a nice family run place I believe.  We walked in and was immediately greeted by the staff. My bf said we wanted to sit at the bar, she walked us over and we picked a good seat.  Hostess, waitress and itamae were very friendly and very prompt with getting drinks and food.  We ordered so many items, I don't remember them all. I remember everything were delicious and fresh. I really like the Soft shell crab, Shrimp tempura, Fried Calamari with Jalapeños, Cucumber Wrap, and Albacore.  Pricing was good too. I recommend this place for fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi j's is seriously the best and most fresh sushi I've ever had! You won't be disappointed with anything. Everything is outstanding! And the environment is very relaxed and comfy! The sushi chefs ( and chef J ) are all so friendly and nice! You can't go wrong with this place! You would never think by the outside of this place that it would be a 5 star joint!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm gonna have to recommend it any who is interested in good sushi"}
{"text":"Not sure why so many others love this place on Yelp, but I wasn't impressed. Servers were friendly, but the sushi chef behind the counter must have been having a really terrible day.  Miso soup was hot and the cucumber sunomono fine. The fried tofu on the salad was heavy- not the nice light agedashi style I was hoping for. Takoyaki from the specials board seemed to have no octopus at all.   Tried 3 rolls and they were underwhelming- lots of fake crab/mayo filling. Skimpy on the fish, eel, and avocado, but heavy on the sauce.  They did bring out a free green tea ice cream sundae (not sure if that's standard?), but though I appreciate the gesture, it wasn't really wanted.  The place had a decent crowd on a Friday night, but I wouldn't return. Will leave it for the other fans."}
{"text":"Excellent chirashi bowl. 21.99. Tasted very fresh and tender. Plenty of rice. House made tomago   Happy days Las Vegas roll was good, and different with the smoked salmon. 5.99  Cardinals roll was ok but nothing special. 13.99   I went back and forth on whether to give them 3 or 4 stars.  Landed on 3 because the cardinal roll was unimpressive and expensive for what it was.    I would go back for the chirashi bowl, but that is it."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the sushi here. We were in town for a concert and thought we give it a try I'm glad we did! We ordered specialty rolls not off at the happy hour menu and we Love them both. Great way to start the evening"}
{"text":"Sushi J is hands down the best sushi in Arizona and that I have ever had. I travel frequently across the country and I have eaten sushi in hotspots like la and Seattle and I can honestly say that J takes the cake.   It's so rare to find a restaurant that truly upholds quality above all else and remains consistent. I have been eating at J's since he opened and I have been delighted by the finest sushi cuts and custom creations by J. You will never be disappointed here and be prepared to become a sushi snob after you try torched fresh salmon belly!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. After spilling hot miso soup on my bare leg and all over our table and chairs, you would think they would have offered a discount on our meal. Nooo.  We love sushi and do not go cheap when we have it.  I won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"The fish is some of the best I've had, everything from the kitchen is good, but my favorite part is the staff. Can't think of a better place I'd rather spend my money to fill my tummy."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out, had it bookmarked for a while and finally got around to it. The venue is clean with a classic Japanese feel and a sushi bar with Itamae that greet everyone coming in. The reviews I previously read were solid and I had a good feeling when the server came and  we could place our order.   I was with a friend and we started of with a miso soup and seaweed salad each, coupled with the hot sake, I believe they only have the one type of hot sake(good value for the price). I LOVE seaweed salad, and this one was really great! Afterwards we ordered some salmon nigiri. I'm always a bit picky with my salmon since I come from Scandinavia, and if there is one fish I really know, it's salmon. I was extremely pleased with what I received. The quality of the salmon was really top notch, as was the ratio of salmon to rice.  The bulk of our dinner was comprised of the maki we ordered next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, we came on a Tuesday in order to take advantage of the \"happy day\" rolls. We ordered the eel tempura roll, Alaska roll, crispy cali roll, and the tootzzy roll. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with what I received. All rolls had a very similar consistency and taste. The majority of the maki was simply a \"smear\" of crab/mayo and the Alaska roll only had a minimal amount of salmon.   All in all, I'll give the place a 4. This is an average of 5+ for the nigiri and the seaweed salad, but a weak 3 on the maki rolls. If It didn't come across, all the rolls we picked came from the \"happy day\" menu.   So, in conclusion (wow this was a long one), I would come back due to the AMAZING salmon nigiri and seaweed salad, the venue, the atmosphere, and the reasonable price. Maybe I'll try the \"full priced\" rolls next time. However, I won't be ordering any of the rolls I already tried!"}
{"text":"Man, I was totally torn whether to write a positive review or not... I always wanna get a table and I felt like if people knew the truth about this place it would be way too packed all the time.  I decided to be a good person and give credit where credit is due. Here's the lowdown:  -- Service is awesome, never had a bad experience but most places in Scottsdale have the basics down when it comes to service.  -- Atmosphere, is nice, no frills really but clean and nice and a good casual date place  --Fun level, if you sit at the bar the sushi chefs are pretty laid back and cool, talkative but not annoying chatty either.  At a table you can have fun, but it's not really a party atmosphere   -- FOOD (the good part, the part we are here for right????) man I tell you, I'm from New Orleans and we take our seafood seriously. This place has some of the freshest sushi I've had ANYWHERE not just in Arizona, Anywhere, seriously, it sounds like I'm joking but I've had Yellowfin Toro every time I've gone cause it's so fresh. Like Will Smith Fresh Prince of Bel Aire fresh. I'm telling you, places in Vegas and New York could take notes on some of the imaginative fun (and tasty) rolls they got here.  The Monster roll (look it up ) in particular is pretty killer but I honestly haven't had a bad roll, some are different and if you are more of a traditionalist, you may or may not want some of them but if that's you, no worries!!! Just get their awesome nigiri cause like I said , it's super fresh.  -- Price, yeah I mean, you could go places cheaper, but why would you? I mean that's like saying \" but some gas stations and grocery stores have sushi for like $5 a roll...\" Yeah yeah, I know, but which would you rather? A frozen burger with no cheese or a good burger with great meat and great toppings ?? Yeah that's what I thought ....   ------------/--/--/--/----------- SUMMARY: If you like sushi, go to Sushi J, see my man \"J\" and get yourself some delicious ass food...  EDIT: I went there again tonight and ordered some fried rice and a couple pieces of sushi(raw fish). My waitress put the items in separate bags so as not to alter the temperature of the raw fish from the hot fried rice. That's how good the service is!! So awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent fish quality. I have nothing to complain about. If you're worried about eating sushi away from the coast, come here. The fish is incredibly fresh and delicious. My new favorite sushi spot in AZ"}
{"text":"For a Sunday night, there wasn't a wait for dinner. My friends ordered some of the simpler rolls (don't remember which, my bad) and enjoyed it. I ordered various nigiris (hamachi, salmon, unagi, hotate), and I thought it was pretty fresh and tasty. I always have a hard time finding a place whose sashimi/nigiri aren't slimy/old tasting, so it was refreshing to find a spot that is literally behind my apartment building that serves up some good fish! I read the other reviews about terrible service? I must've came on a better night, 'cause I didn't have any issues regarding service at all, it was super nice!"}
{"text":"You know the sushi is great when you can't wait to get home to write a 5 star review! My friend and I sat at the sushi bar. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that J, the owner, makes the sushi. Every roll we watched him make looked like a piece of art! J has talent!  I ordered a bowl of edamame (steamed or nuked perfectly), the happy hour Las Vegas roll and the Alaska roll. That was by far the best Vegas roll I've ever had. The salmon and crab meat were soooo fresh! The Alaska roll was good, but I probably won't order it again with so many other choices.  My friend had the Candy Cane and Superman rolls. She liked the Candy Cane roll so much that she ordered a second one. The service was excellent- almost a little TOO good because the wait staff kept standing behind us in anticipation of our last bite to remove our plates (were they short on dishes?). I hadn't even started chewing my last piece when he reached to take my plate. I almost choked on my food as I tried to ask him to leave my plate so I could save the sauce for my second roll.   I loved our experience at Sushi J so much that I returned the following night to try the Candy Cane roll. My new fav roll AND my new fav sushi restaurant.  I highly recommend you try Sushi J!"}
{"text":"Great selection of rolls and affordable lunch specials.  Sashimi was very fresh and tasty. Also provided a free miso and salad to accompany the sashimi lunch special. Las Vegas roll was delicious to!   Fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious sushi, great variety, and super-friendly staff and service! The food is always fresh, generous, and filling. There hasn't been a roll I ordered that I didn't enjoy, and I leave stuffed to the gills and happy as a clam. (Though, come to think of it, clams probably don't have the self-awareness to know if they're happy).  I say just go on to Sushi J for your sushi needs. Figure out clam feelings later."}
{"text":"Went shopping at TJMax with friends and after quickly looking at YELP and seeing this place had 4.5 stars thought we'd try it out. The place was almost completely full at 8:00pm on a Wednesday night. The menu was huge with good prices. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. We then ordered the best sushi I've had in AZ for quite some time. I'm talking melt in your mouth sushi. We had a variety of rolls and Nigiri. All of it was excellent. The cucumber salad was delicious too, thinly sliced with just the right amount of vinegar...light and refreshing. The tempura veggies were yummy too. Boy was I surprised when I opened up YELP to write this review and saw all the recent one star reviews. All I can say is this was my first visit and I will be back."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  I've never had sushi in Japan and I'm not a sushi expert.  That said, this place is great.  They serve high quality sushi that is very tasty.  It seems a lot more fresh than some other sushi places I've tried around Scottsdale.  The Prince of Persia role is my favorite.  But any roll will do because they are all delicious."}
{"text":"Ok sushi at best. Prices are pretty average so that's a plus. The service was very good and the sushi chef was very courteous. I would go back... and I did and it was horrible. Changed my original review from three stars to two stars"}
{"text":"SUPER fresh sushi. Great service. $2 off our wine glasses. Don't be fooled by the outside; the inside is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Bad quality of Sashimi. Less amount of seaweed salad. The roll is not tight, it fall apart when you try to eat it. I will never come back this place called Sushi Joke."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant when trying new sushi places; however I went here for a friends birthday with a huge group and was very surprised.   It's clean, modern and very well kept. The owners clearly take pride in their business. The service amazing. The food is even better. Homemade Wasabi- WOW. it's the best. Rolls are made to order with super fresh ingredients. Miso soup was hot, flavorful and had great seaweed in it. They brought out a plate with butterfish and I was very iffy about trying but I'm glad I did. Overall I couldn't be happier. The prices are also very reasonable.   If you are hesitant about going here- don't be. It's bomb.com."}
{"text":"Great fish quality. Not bad customer service. But why did we have to wait 20 minutes for our last roll? Meaning we ordered 4 items, finished 3, then stared at each other for 20 minutes with nothing to eat. It wasn't like they forgot, our server kept coming back around and apologizing saying it will be out soon blah blah but eventually we just cancelled the last roll cause our appetite was gone. I guess they were trying to serve each table 1 or 2 rolls at a time instead of finishing the entire order at once. I really dislike when restaurants do that because I'm not trying to spend 2 hours to complete my dinner! Also, if people came in after us it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if they got their food after us. That's normally how it works. Such a pity cause we liked the food.  And one thing, don't slice the pieces into odd numbers! The monster roll was delicious but I contemplated whether or not to rock paper scissor the last piece. Lol"}
{"text":"Try the monster roll, you will not be disappointed, it's massive but tastes amazing.  The sushi J roll is good and the fire in the mouth, they pair their sauces really well."}
{"text":"I'm by no means an expert on sushi. I usually allow others to order and pick around blindly finding things I like. I can tell a huge difference in taste, freshness and presentation. This place does that well and has a very friendly vibe. We sat at the sushi bar and had the right amount of friendly conversation as we enjoyed our meal. It was good and I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent FRESH Sushi! Loved all the rolls I had. Ordered Escolar Sashimi which just melted in my mouth. Our server was great and offered advice since she knew it was our first time. I will go back anytime I'm on the east side of the valley."}
{"text":"Being that I travel for a living and my overwhelming enjoyment of prerty much all things sushi, I like to try as many places as possible when it comes to sushi bars. This one is amongst the best and is my favorite!  Not exactly cheap mind you. For the best deals come in Sunday through Thursday and select from the Happy Day rolls."}
{"text":"Yes, this sushi place was great, incredible rolls and extremely fresh fish considering its miles from the nearest body of water.  Our server Edison picked out a roll for us (some sort of salmon roll with salmon sashima on top of it as well) it made the evening !  highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Sushi here was fresh and made to order. They have a good happy hour roll selection that lasts all day Sunday thru Thursday. They do close between lunch and dinner but if you love close to this little hidden gem, for sure try it out."}
{"text":"We love this place! We always stop through when we're in town. The waitress we like there always has spot on recommendations and upgrades (we know to say yes!!!) and everything has been fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"If you want fresh quality fish and unique rolls do not pass up Sushi J!!! Don't hesitate to ask J to make you something special, he never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price! I ordered carry out and it was still great. They were also offering 10% off all orders to celebrate their anniversary. Such a nice surprise! I'll be coming back again as I work right down the street!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, and very economical!  This is in part due to their awesome 30% off dinner deal they are doing right now for their grand opening.  So far, we've been twice and tried the Vegas Roll, The J Roll, The Dragon Roll, and two of their low carb rolls, the Marilyn MonRoll and the Friday Night Fever Roll.  The only one we wouldn't order again is the J Roll.  It's wrapped in a soy paper that had a weird texture, reminded me of chicken skin!  But I'd definitely order the low-carb rolls again, they are so yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, kinda over prices and the service was so slow I watched people leave!"}
{"text":"We were impressed with the positive reviews and let them overcome our hesitation upon see the place from outside. The inside wasn't anymore reassuring. The worn carpet, fishy smell and torn bench in the booth should have sent us back to our car to continue our search. If mediocre food is your idea of five stars, you found your place. The miso soup was tasteless, the pot stickers were bland with a sauce that was way too salty, and our two rolls were uninspired. When the rolls came with white ginger and both the specialty Crispy Bay and the classic Rainbow roll were ungarnished and skinny, we knew we were going to be disappointed. I was willing to grant another star if the dessert even came close to the waitress' lavish praise. But unfortunately it too was pretty weak. Two stars is generous."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. Driven by several times but never when hungry lol. Finally made it in and it was worth it. Place looks closed most the time so make sure to park and walk up. It's worth it! Nothing we had was bad. Homemade green tea ice cream was amazing. Will def be back to try all the other rolls!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience! Delicious sushi and excellent service.  In particular, Yan greeted us with a warm smile and was so hospitable. She had us laughing, and we learned some of the sushi she enjoys too."}
{"text":"Raw fish that's fresh in the middle of the scorching-hot, arid Sonoran Desert is a huge challenge, I would imagine for sushi restaurants. But Sushi J has defied geography and has made it his own \"standard\" to always have the best cuts of the freshest fish (recently caught) with papers to prove otherwise.  I've only visited once (on a date) and had the special opportunity of having off-the-menu plates made exclusively by \"J\" himself. It was near life-changing - let me tell you... Quality of fish was on par with fish found in CA or WA, in my opinion.   I'm also not a wasabi fan - I hate the taste and avoid it at all costs. My date pleaded with me to at least try J's \"real wasabi\", not the fake, mint-green paste I've been avoiding. I try to be open-minded and so I did - quite impressive! It was almost a \"relish\" type consistency and really didn't taste similar to the mint-green paste at all!  The atmosphere isn't fancy or upscale, but it isn't a dump either. It's simple and serves its purpose - to provide a high-quality sushi experience. I would definitely rate this restaurant as #1 in the Valley, by far."}
{"text":"I find myself at Sushi J every time I come to Scottsdale. I love that I always see the same people working with their fine hospitality. Price is very good value and the sushi is very fresh for being in the middle of a dessert. Will always return."}
{"text":"Great sushi, sashimi, and everything else! I came here for the first time last week and have been back a couple times already. Great happy hour deals and the Las Vegas roll is really yummy. I also had their sashimi lunch special which comes with miso soup, salad, and an appetizer - all fresh and delicious for a great deal! They currently have a 15% off deal for customer appreciation, so one more reason to eat here! Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Excellent quality.  Reasonable prices.  Fantastic wine special: $32 for a bottle, app, & 2 rolls!  Lightning fast service!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly tradition with my partner. We love this place! The staff is very nice and they always make sure you are taken care of. We tend to have dinner on Monday night, during happy hour. They have a great assortment of rolls and appetizers, as well as drink options. The fried rice is amazing (always fresh and hot). If you're looking for a quality sushi spot in old town, Sushi Js will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific place!! The fish is very fresh; crunchy sushi rolls are served with the tops still warm. The \"Happy Day\" discount menu for Sunday - Thursday is limited but offers very generous portions if you just want to sample and share basic rolls like Philly, Tootzi, Spicy Tuna, Cal rolls. (This menu is not available for takeout.) We will definitely be going back to Sushi J!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been to an I've been to them all. I tried everything an it was ALL awesome! The chefs are pros they can do it all and some. Always has an attractive and friendly crowd which never hurts ;)  Try the Butterfish ;)"}
{"text":"I'm really confused as to what all the good ratings are about.  My wife and I went there since it's the only place in the strip mall area that's not a sports bar.  Their \"happy day\" selection is pretty mediocre and those are the only specials they really have.  We tried the crunchy california, the spider, and one special roll.  All of them were OK. Their eel sauce is \"homemade\" but its weak and not flavorful.  If the pricing was lower maybe this place would be acceptable but for the same bill I can go to Sakana or Sakebombers and get way better quality, service, decor, and overall experience."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a good price. The stuffed jalapeño appetizer and the crunchy bay roll were awesome! We called and made a reservation which was probably good since the restaurant is a little smaller."}
{"text":"There are sushi restaurants and there are \"Sushi\" restaurants. We're fortunate in Scottsdale to have many to choose from, but there are none better than Sushi J. \"J\" is an artist. Food quality is super; the salmon sashimi is absolutely exquisite. But where \"J\" sets himself apart is with his supremely creative rolls. I'd suggest a particular roll, but we normally just ask him to be creative so if they have names, we rarely know what they might be. He has never let us down. Delectable and beautiful. The ambiance is homey, warm and friendly. We have a couple of very nice sushi restaurants close to our home, but we find the drive to Sushi J's well worth the effort."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this restaurant and I have to say that everytime I've been there I've never been disappointed. The service is amazing and so is the food! I crave the food all the time!  Will be in again and again and again.   I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Honestly not the best sushi by far. My boyfriend and I went to try it out as we just moved up here. However we left leaving two full plates untouched due it not tasting good. And when we said we didn't like it sever said \" ok\" and we still paid for it even though we didn't touch it and didn't wish to take it home. After we left we both started to feel sick and nauseated. Now we both are at home wanting to lay down or be near the bathroom. I do not recommend going here."}
{"text":"The sushi was decent. Got a las Vegas and \"the roll\". (i can't remember which was which but I'm 85% sure the las Vegas was the fried roll with cream cheese and poached salmon )The las Vegas wasn't that good in our opinion, it tasted more like Americanized sushi but that might have just been poor choice on our part since that is why we usually don't get sushi with cream cheese. \"The roll\" was good though, it tasted fresh and spicy and I believe it had tuna and eel. Other than that the experience was mostly good, the miso soup was good(though I do wish they would give more per bowl, it was pretty small), my friend said she loved the house salad, and the veggie tempura was good. Also our waitress was super nice and attentive. I would go again."}
{"text":"I don't know if Sushi J has changed owners, I went on an off night god knows what happened during my disastrous visit but I can tell you is that I will never ever visit this place again.   I came here after a fellow yelp buddy recommended it, who is like me, a fan of traditional Japanese no frills just great fresh fish sushi and after reading a ton of great reviews (and seeing some insane pictures) I thought this was going to be a great evening. Wrong!  I walked in, and asked to be seated at the sushi bar... They were busy but not insanely busy. My waiter (who was the only saving grace of this evening) came over and asked me what I wanted to drink, I ordered some sake and asked him if I could do an omakase meal he said absolutely and he spoke to the sushi chef, I told my waiter and the chef that I eat everything and prefer more traditional style sushi. The chef then tells me he will make me a great roll - I should have known right then that this wasn't going to end well. I clarify to him that I do more nigiri sushi, sashimi and wanted like ebi, uni etc. He says ok ok....  I wait for what seems like forever, I am then served my first dish... Two pieces of salmon sashimi wrapped around KRAB with spicy mayo and avocado on top and two pieces of tuna belly nigiri.... Ummmmm, no. I call over my waiter and politely say that this isn't really what I was wanting, that I don't eat krab and that I had asked for whatever was fresh.   My waiter, bless him... gets me a new sushi chef, I move closer to them. There was obviously ZERO communication between the chefs or my waiter and my new chef because after waiting about 15 minutes for my next plate, I was served nearly an identical plate of two tuna nigiri and salmon sashimi. After I receive that plate the sushi chef asks me if I was done. While I was eating my mediocre sushi, I saw my sushi chef take out a VACCUM SEALED BAG OF TUNA, that was enough to take my appetite away. I told the chef that I was done and I just wanted my bill. I explained to her that I had driven 30 minutes in the rain that evening to try their place out after hearing great things and that I was frustrated that I was served basically the same thing twice. I arrived at 6:40 and left at 7:35 with two courses, beyond upset and frustrated.   The manager/owner came over as I was waiting to sign my bill, apologized profusely, gave me a hug and you could tell she felt bad and gave me a coupon for 10.00 off a future visit, she didn't charge me for one order of the sushi and took 15% off my bill.   I appreciate them going to great lengths to try and rectify the situation but things went so bad that I don't think there is any way I could ever look past the faults of the evening, and the whole tuna vacuumed sealed in a bag... ick  I am borderline 1.5-2.0 stars for this place based on my experience. I would assume if you are looking for more traditional sushi this would be a great spot for you, but if you're like me and you want traditional sushi your better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love sushi J.  It was my first time visiting~  The saying, \"dont judge a book by its cover\" is right!   Its very modern and clean inside and I love the layout of the restaurant.  I tried the Friday night fever, sashimi, and the udon! I absolutely loved it:)"}
{"text":"Incredible dishes (high prices). Friendly people. Too dark lighting though for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, inventive rolls, excellent atmosphere, no unnecessary frills....I have been to many sushi bars over the years and this is one of the very best."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale for work and found this place on Yelp! So, I decided to go check it out.  My server Jessica was a complete delight. She was great with suggesting and her recommendations where on point."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little spot.  My GF flew in early today for the weekend and she was craving Sushi.....saw the Yelp reviews and had to give it a try.  we arrived before they opened.  They still seated and served us.  Really friendly staff that was  great with the lunch special suggestions.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The owner Jay holds out on the good fish for his regulars. Gives the shoe meat to new customers."}
{"text":"The fish quality was amazing. Loved the sushi and had to be rolled out of there. Yum. Our waitress was fast and good. And the prices were quite reasonable. This restaurant is a small hole in the wall in a strip mall. Definitely not aimed at tourists.    My complaint is with another member of the service staff. The girl who was responsible for taking empty plates away, re-filling your water, etc was there literally every 2 minutes. And she would interrupt your conversation to ask if you wanted more water, were we done with this or that, can she take it away. At first it was like OK...let's stay hydrated. But then it became very annoying as we could not actually even have a dinner conversation since it was being interrupted so often. So in no way was it a relaxing dinner.   If I was back in Scottsdale, I would want to go back for the food as it was delicious. But I would not do it I wanted to have a fun, relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in town. The owners are really nice and the prices are fair. The live shrimp Friday and Saturday is fantastic and worth a try. I have eaten at this restaurant since 2014 and I have never been disappointed in the quality of food or the service. It may be busy some nights but that is expected in a restaurant with such high quality food. Even if you order food off the happy hour menu it is above what the competitors are offering in both quality and portions.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't remember what this sushi place was called before Sushi J took over, but I remember over the years it went downhill (it was good at one point), and I wasn't surprised when it finally closed.  I finally came in since the change was made and thought the sushi itself was delicious! In fact, from a pure sushi/taste/freshness standpoint it's probably the best I've had in the Phoenix area.   I ordered rolls from the \"Happy Day\" menu (basically Happy Hour), which is offered all day Sun-Thurs. Both the spicy tuna roll & eel tempura (which is not roll you'd commonly find on a HH menu) were delicious. All the HH rolls are under $6, and there's a few more options than just the standard things you'd see at most sushi places (in addition to eel tempura I know the Las Vegas roll was on the menu).  For the sushi and service alone (our waitress was very attentive and OFFERED to split our bill individually for 6 people) I'd give this place 5 stars. The reason I'm not is I guess a personal one, but hey, it's my review.  I generally associate sushi places w/Happy Hour, and like I mentioned this place has rolls all day Sun-Thurs (not Friday), and that's it. No appetizer specials. No drink specials (although I believe our waitress mentioned something about house wine specials that weren't on the menu). The sushi itself here is great though, and I definitely come back for it."}
{"text":"Good sushi, great service, reasonable price.  My wife and I were looking for a new sushi spot and were very pleased with Sushi J.  They have a great variety of rolls, nigiri, and, sashimi.  Rolls are unique and not drenched in mayo or eel sauce like many other Phoenix sushi restaurants (Sushi Brokers).  The server was quick and responsive  The environment was upbeat and comfortable, great for families  Highly recommended !!!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite sushi restaurants! I have not had a roll that was not fantastic. The different sashimi dishes were all amazing. Try anything that J makes for you."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials on many rolls and appetizers. Good kitchen dishes like extra crunchy tempura and calamari with jalapeños."}
{"text":"Great Location at downtown Scottsdale just by the mall.   They have huge Happy hour menu and all day HH on Monday and Sunday.   Must try the toro!!  It's so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"First off, the service was great which can always make or break a restaurant for me. I had the Thai heat drink and it was delicious. Sushi was also fresh and great. We came on a Thursday so it was sushi happy hour all day and luckily some of our favorite rolls were on happy hour. Very pleased, will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Had lunch. Went in at noon as soon as it opened. Really nice waitress. Had the Prince of Persia, Cardinal Roll, salmon tataki and hamachi carpaccio. Freshest fish. Was shocked only one other table in there. Some really creative rolls but only so much we could eat for lunch! Drinks were iced green tea and Bad Panda IPA. Recommend both!"}
{"text":"Don't judge this restaurant by its exterior. Good fish and well done sushi. The staff and sushi men are fantastic and have a great memory for return customers! An oasis in the TJ Maxx parking lot."}
{"text":"Very good menu, especially if you stop in Mon-Thursday. The staff was very friendly including the sushi chefs...very helpful. Beautiful plate presentation. Maybe my favorite sushi spot especially since its so close to my house"}
{"text":"We really liked sushi J. My parents and I were in town for one night only and I was craving some sush. It was dec 30th and we weren't sure operating hours so we rolled the dice and called sushi j. They saved their last table for us and we were very grateful!   Hungry upon arrival they served us with a smile and ran around  like crazy for what seemed like and unusually large crowd.   My lenders got the cardinal and monster roll and really enjoyed them.  I got the chef's choice sashimi platter, even got to substitute for some mackerel, and it was hearty! The tuna cuts were so thick, it was fantastic!   Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is excellent here, hate to say it but it's just as good if not better than Dozo was.  Would be nice if the J made the rounds and introduced himself with more than the regulars and the service staff could be a tad more attentive but the sushi was sublime.  I wish I could find a place in Az that utilizes black cod too in some sushi dishes!"}
{"text":"Nope. Once you walk in, there is a smell. I couldn't put my finger on what smell it was but it sure wasn't a good smell. We were the first customers of the day. We were seated and given the menu. We waited and waited and waited for the server to take our orders. The sushi chefs saw me looking around waiting for the waitress. The staff were just talking and ignoring that we were just waiting. When she finally arrived, I began placing my order and was surprised to have the waitress interrupt me mid sentence. She continued to talk about how good the monster roll was. Also, the Alaska roll is on the happy day menu but not on the normal menu.   We ordered the monster roll, ahi ahi tartare, and dynamite roll.   The ahi ahi tartare was good. Surprised how small it was though.   Monster roll was by far the best option we ordered. You get 5 pieces.   Dynamite roll was odd. It tasted like something was missing. I appreciated the nice pieces of scallop but was a little disappointed by how little of the topping there was.   Overall I'm disappointed. I can't believe this place was voted top sushi restaurant. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been back several times.  Service has been great and sushi has been very adequate.  I'm a sucker for yellowtail sashimi and it has been delectable.  We also enjoyed the specialty rolls which I typically avoid but must admit the Marilyn MonRoll and cucumber rolls we awesome.    Also they have been giving 30% discount for grand opening and that has made it the best deal I'm town.   I'd say it's better that the sushi ra and stingray BS while not at Roku Akor, Shinbay calibre but it's not nearly as expensive"}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials. Definitely try it out.  We got several different rolls and was so stuffed at the end of our meal, we fought over who had to eat the last piece...happy arguments...  All the rolls were very good and weren't just full of rice. We got the toro too which was like butter. Delicious!   Service was very good. The facilities were clean too:)"}
{"text":"Came in as part of a big group. I had the chicken cultlet which was juicy and breaded just right and the sushi was up to par to other places we have been at a reasonable price. Will definitely put this on the list of places to check out when we are in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in all of Scottsdale! It is super convenient to get to and has a ton of parking.  Every time I go in, they are busy, but I have also never really had to wait for a table.  They only have one area that I have seen that can be used for larger groups as they mostly have little tables.    My favorite rolls are the Monster Roll and the Lord of Tuna Roll.  Everything is amazing though!  I have ordered most rolls and I would recommend pretty much anything. The non sushi dishes I have had a more limited experience with, but  again everything I have tried was very very good."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. It is a small place and was pretty busy. They didn't have enough people working and service was a bit slow. I couldn't decide whether or not to get the Geisha roll or Cardinal roll. I decided on the Cardinal roll, spider roll and my husband got the Samurai roll. We didn't care for the spider roll. It had a weird taste. The waiter brought me the Geisha roll instead of the Cardinal.  It was good but the Samurai was better. As we finished up the waiter realized I got the wrong order and brought me the Cardinal roll on the house. I liked it better than the Geisha. Overall, our experience was OK. I can't say it was any better or worse than anywhere else I have been."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a friend while on vacation in Scottsdale for a week and a half after someone had recommended it to my friend. I'm ALL about sushi but honestly had no idea what kind of sushi place this would be.  I ordered the miso soup and three rolls. The soup was great and I really enjoyed all of the rolls that I ordered. What's nice is that Sun-Th you can order smaller versions of some of the rolls (5 pieces vs. 8 pieces) for a fraction of the price, which allows you to try more. Two of the rolls I ordered were tempura fried, but in a different way than I had ever tried before. It was more like the rolls were coated in breadcrumb-like crunch rather than a full on deep fry of the roll, and I liked it because it didn't feel like a heavy deep fried sushi meal.  My friend ordered the vegetable tempura and really liked it. She said the same thing about the crunch as well--different but really good. She also had sashimi and enjoyed it, but that's not my area of expertise.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars here is because the service was slow (didn't see a server for 20 minutes at a time when we actually had a question or wanted to order or get the bill), but I hate to completely tank a rating based on one service experience, especially when I see other reviews about good service."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had in AZ. Eager and friendly staff. Seems like they have a lot of regulars. Was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, they've worked well with the space they have but I'm excited for their new location!"}
{"text":"Sushi J is a great local sushi spot in old town Scottsdale. Definitely not your 'see & be seen' overrated & overpriced Ra or terrible service of Stingray. Locally owned, Chef J is knowledgeable & takes great care in creating an experience you want to come back for. The salmon skin roll is one of the best I've ever had & the yellowtail sushi was fresh & well portioned. The Lord of Tuna roll with thin slices of lemon, plus \"fresh\" wasabi was incredible!  The portions are generous & the pricing fair. They have great \"Happy Day\" specials...all day specials vs just a happy 'hour.'  Maggie was awesome & so personable on the phone we had to come in for he 4th of July to celebrate with them! Tina was wonderful as well & as a team their service was delightful.  If you're looking for your neighborhood sushi spot in old town Scottsdale that's perfect connecting & enjoying sushi with people who want you coming back, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating at Sushi J quite a few times and have always been happy with the service and food. I've been fortunate to experience some of the best sushi of my life in New York and California so being able to find high quality sushi here in Scottsdale makes me happy.  I would gladly recommend Sushi J to anyone who's in the area looking for some great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Place was good as Dozo, better now as Sushi J; we look forward to coming back. The 30% grand opening discount was an added bonus!"}
{"text":"I live in LA.... I have been to the hottest and best sushi restaurants in Malibu, and LA. Like Nobu... This place is just as good if not better!!!  Fish is very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went in there yesterday for lunch. I asked for a sushi roll to be made a specific way and they were able to complete that perfectly! All the food was really tasty and the service was really nice! We will definitely eat her again!"}
{"text":"Presentation was good, but the quality of the fish wasn't there and the prices were pretty high too, $8 for a spicy tuna and all specialty rolls were more than $12.  The \"deal\" rolls are the same price per piece as the regular rolls, just less pieces.  Even with the 15% discount because they just opened I was still disappointed.  Overall I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Phoenix. Whenever I go someplace new it becomes a mission to find delicious sushi. Originally I wanted to go to one of the local conveyor style sushi places but my husband found this place on yelp instead. All he needed to say was \"Love Me Salmon\" roll and I was hooked. That and the cucumber roll were definitely my two favorite dishes of the night! We also ordered the Monster roll and another one which I can't remember. My husband had a beer and I had some hot green tea, and we both finished with a scoop of green tea ice cream to share!  The only thing I was disappointed with was the hot tea. I was expecting something flavorful but I'm convinced it may have been dish water. It was very burned. It's hard to screw up tea so I set my expectations pretty low after that. I couldn't even drink it. Fortunately everything else was delicious.   And for the most part the service was stellar! At one point during our meal we overheard two servers talking about how they were going to get a massive tip from this other party. It's not major but I thought it was a bit unprofessional to discuss on the floor within earshot of other patrons.  In the end our bill was close to $100 including our tip. It's definitely not cheap, but the food was phenomenal. If you've got deep pockets and an empty belly craving sushi, I'd consider this a place worth visiting once a month."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted very politely.   Seated right away with preference to bar or booth.  Edamame wasn't soggy and was good.  Tootzy roll was larger than most and filled with flavor.  Service was excellent!   Great food! Green tea is delicious too!   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in scottsdale!! If you haven't been do it!! fresh fish, awesome, service and happy hour all day."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and awesome service.  Good atmosphere and at a great price.  My wife, son, and I really enjoyed our rolls.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best prices I have seen. They have a Sunday threw Thursday menu that beats most. The roles were very big and very good. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I went to Sushi J two weeks ago with my wife and a couple of friends. The entire meal was awesome. I only had sushi and sashimi, so I can't talk to the other items on the menu. However, everything I ate was very fresh and tasted fantastic.   The only things I would change: Colder beer and warmer room temperature. The beer was cool, but I like my beer very cold. The restaurant air temp was a little cold for me, but I think it was because it was chilly outside. That is all I would change.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for great sushi and at a good price."}
{"text":"I told my wife: \"Sushi in AZ?!...no thanks!\"   Soooo glad I did though.   Mountain of meaty fresh & well flavored fish!  For lunch, we got the J sashimi combo (plus the \"ADD\" of spicy tuna), cucumber wrap (didn't even get a chance to try it since my wife said it was so good), & Prince of Persia roll (lots of meat and lots of good flavor combo)  Sashimi slices were more like burger patties!  No joke.   I don't eat rice, but I actually wanted to get some rice because the slices were so big.   I hope Arizonians (I'm a San Diegan) support this place so we have a legit place to keep coming back to for business trips.    Side note...The playlist stood out to me because I don't think there was a single song that I didn't like (I know, it's minute, but it helps the ambiance...which, while we're at it, good ambiance, except the tables needed an upgrade)."}
{"text":"Love the Uni here best around and the Prince of Persia roll is amazing. Best sushi spot in AZ!!"}
{"text":"So I'm back again for the second time in a week... and tonight I am requesting Omakase. When I walk in, J's wife greats me, remembers me, and seats me at the sushi bar near J. I order some sake and let J know that I'm along for the ride and I'm excited to try anything he puts in front of me. I love omakase dining! I get to experience the chef's creativity and taste off-menu items that are unique and oftentimes, a little more adventurous.  My server James, who is also happy to see me back so soon, quickly delivers the bottle of cold sake that chef recommends, Kikiumo or something like that... is the lt blue bottle.  My first dish is presented and J explains that he's made striped bass wrapped around steamed asparagus and a thin slice of avocado. The two pieces are each topped with massago, scallions, and just a few sesame seeds. He says no need to use soy and I'm always more than happy not to mask the subtle flavors of the sashimi with soy. He points out the green sauce in the corner of the plate, pickled wasabi sauce, use just a little bit on top of each bite. Wow! I'm not sure the proper terms to describe the flavors of sashimi, but these bites were perfect mouthfuls of clean and fresh fish perfectly complimented by the sour and spice of the pickled wasabi sauce.  Chef continues to educate and entertain me and the other bar diners throughout the meal. He describes each dish he serves to me and seems genuinely eager to know I've enjoyed it.  I have buttery yellowtail belly that has been torch seared slightly, garnished, and drizzled with ginger ponzu. It's better than any yellowtail one ever tasted.  Chef J brings me fresh bluefin otorro two ways. Two pieces quickly torch seared to bring about the sweetness of the fat with a little ponzu. The other pieces are not garnished at all. Otorro is the best of the best! It's extraordinarily tender and nearly melts in my mouth.  Next up, fresh scallops served right in the shell. I love seared scallops and this is my first time tasting fresh, raw scallops. It's a familiar flavor yet with a sweet freshness and delicate soft texture that is wonderful. I may never settle for seared scallops again! Chef J brings me a deconstructed Albacore belly dish. The richness of the fish and creamy avocado, the salty salmon eggs, and smokey Bonito flakes, all balance perfectly with a touch of ginger sauce.  Mackerel is next and each piece of fish is topped with a little bit of massago and thin slice of jalapeno. Chef remembers from the first time he saw me, that I think ponzu is overwhelming with this strongly flavored dish and he omits it.  We're almost done... torch seared salmon belly in a mustard ponzu is the last savory dish I enjoy before what I'll call the dessert course. Much like ending a french meal with a sweet plating of seared foie gras, chef makes me baked eel with tamago and sesame. The sweet warm richness of this final dish is the perfect ending to a flawless and fresh fish adventure!"}
{"text":"One star simply because this place DOES NOT actually open according to their hours listed on their door or on their website.  I'm not even able to rate upon food because they've never been open during their business hours when I go.   Today is Sunday. According to the internet sushi j should be open at 5. According to the sign on the door it should be open at 5:30. Regardless, my boyfriend and I showed up at 5:40 to a completely dark restaurant and when I peered into the restaurant it was empty, and dirty dishes were still on the table with no one to be found. We stood outside along with another gentleman who also believe they were supposed to be open. We both ended up leaving for other options.   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO US. Why bother to post hours if you're not going to follow them. Trust me, I am not the type to write a negative reviews, you can even scroll my past reviews to see but when it's your third time to try and eat at a restaurant that everyone raves about and they aren't open. It's not worth it. I'll stick with Sakana or sushi roku. Save your time, they're probably not even open."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, very nice atmosphere and good, friendly service.  All of the rolls looked yummy ~  it was hard to choose, but we went with the Geisha and Dynamite rolls ~ both were great (LOVED the dynamite!).  The pork gyozo was some of the best we've tasted.  The appetizer and big beer combo was a really good value.    We had an especially fun time sitting at the sushi bar chatting with J.  We are SO excited to have this wonderful new sushi bar and restaurant in our 'hood!!"}
{"text":"I have to say the service was amazing here! Very attentive and beyond friendly. The sushi on the other hand l couldn't have been more disappointed. Our sashimi tasted fresh and was the only good food item we had. The rolls tasted mushy and had no distinct flavor and they all tasted the same. We had just moved here and we were really craving sushi. Was sad that this is so close but was not only the worst sushi I've had but also the most expensive."}
{"text":"from out of town, used the yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. Local place, with very nice and attentive staff.  Sushi was excellent, very fresh.  Sushi chef and owner was engaging, friendly and took pride in his food."}
{"text":"I order takeout from them several times per month. Can't really comment on quality of the food because avocado rolls and edamame taste good pretty much anywhere. But they have great service and are super nice. If you are trying to decide between here and the sushi place next door..go here."}
{"text":"The sashimi was the best I have had in town in many years! Everything came out with wonderful presentation. The waiter was very attentive, and eager to answer any menu questions.   I will definitely be back for the Yellowtail and Salmon Toros!"}
{"text":"Great Fresh sushi anytime we go. Staff is great and always remember who we are and remembers we like extra ginger and lemons. Brings it out without having to ask. Quick service during lunch rush."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than five stars. The sushi was amazing. We had the blue find tuna sushi with fresh wasabi...it wasn't in a paste form. So good! I've never had tuna that actually felt like it was melting in your mouth. Sounds weird, right? But really..just like that. We ordered a variety of sushi & rolls. Everything was wonderful. So fresh.  The chef explained where they sourced different types of fish & why. Very informative. Service was great. I loved it when it was Dozo too. So happy to have this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We came to Sushi J for the first time on a Friday for lunch because we have seen their awesome reviews and we are constantly in this shopping center. We walked in and were instantly greeted by the sushi chefs and our server, David. Needless to say, this is our new favorite spot. The customer service was outstanding by both our server and the sushi chefs. I got the Crunchy Cali Roll and the Tootzy Roll on their Happy Hour rolls, and my boyfriend got the Alaskan, the California, and the Spicy Tuna Rolls. The first and last pieces of each of the rolls were filled with extra fish and other fillings. David also recommended a sauce they make fresh in-house called their Ginger Garlic Sauce, and it paired so well with it all. Everything is greatly priced, fresh, and delicious. They have so many different specials, and apparently on Monday's they have happy hour all day! I love supporting local places, and I'm so glad we decided to stop in because we will now be regulars at Sushi J! Thank you for such an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first time with my fiancé and 2 other friends who are regulars. I have to say the sushi was amazing! It all was very fresh, and the pork Gyozo dumplings were fantastic as well! The restaurant was clean and our waitress was very attentive. My fiancé and I agree we will be back again soon! And this time WE will be bringing 2 people who have never enjoyed Sushi J's before!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi joint in the Phoenix area, HANDS DOWN!!! Maybe I haven't tried enough other places out here, I don't know. I've been going to Sushi J for about 3 years now, and I do see lots of shifts in quality and service, etc. but it's still my favorite. Sushi is fresh, nicely prepared, and unique."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about the sushi here! The Dynamite Roll is dynamite! Originally prepared, definitely try it! The Monster roll was also super delicious! The service was prompt, kind and super attentive. We will definitely return for more Green Tea ice cream too! Five stars for sure! The food was so terrific I forgot to take pictures! Next time!"}
{"text":"I don't like sharing my favorite funds, but I felt compelled. Food is great! Have brought out of town folks here because it is so great."}
{"text":"I knew I should have stuck to sushi, but decided to order one of their lunch meals. I ordered the salmon teriyaki and the further you ate away from the teriyaki sauce the saltiness on the vegetables became noticeable. The salmon teriyaki was moist, flavorful, and dangerous. It wasn't properly deboned! I stopped eating after the 3rd bone jammed me in the gums. I would have said something before my bill arrived, but no one checked in after I encountered the bones. I told my waiter, but it didn't seem to register or he didn't care. The tuna sushi I had was melt in your mouth delicious. The only saving grace of this trip. Btw, this place should be 3-$; my entree and 2 sushi pieces over $30!"}
{"text":"This place DOES have the best sushi in Phoenix. Why go anywhere else? We sat at the sushi bar and had their pork gyoza and a hot sake to start. This was by far the best gyoza (potstickers) I have ever ate. We then ordered salmon sashimi, soft shell crab, and a side salad. Their sashimi and soft shell crab was \"OUT OF THIS WORLD\"!  As much as I would love to keep this place to myself, I am happy to share it with my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! We went last night and while the place isn't the swankiest...the food was really good and the service was fantastic. Cynthia is such a nice person and really provided excellent customer service.   The beer + appetizer deal was great and so was the monster roll. Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Sunday: Ordered the tuna roll but asked for it teka maki style and it was fresh and just the right amount of rice to fish ratio.  Also ordered salmon sashimi and superman roll which were also good, but the tuna roll was what I thought was best. Oh, and tried the butterfish for first time and thought it was good too, but since was my first time ever for this fish i have no reference but liked it.  I actually went there to see if they had high quality toro, but, sadly, I was told they don't serve it even though it's winter time:-(...boo. Nice quite atmosphere and clean dinning room.  Mom said the bathroom smelled sewage like and that they should deodorize or fix sewage pipes (they just opened for the day).  No such smell in dinning area and i didn't use mens room, so don't know if same in there. Service was pretty good for just one waitress, but we had to wait 15 or so minutes to order second round of sushi.  Almost asked for check instead, but son was really hungary.  Again, it was a Sunday and we showed up at 5:20pm, so i'm not going to fret too much because it is a small local business.  Not dying to go back, but it is on my list of good enough to recommend if one is in the area and not looking for fatty tuna on menu."}
{"text":"First Walking in the hosts greeted us very welcoming and we already had the impression of being a great environment.   The setting was very mellow and relaxing with peaceful music and soft.   The waitress was very informative and amazing.  She had great recommendation and would check us very frequently  I would definitely recommend sushi j to everyone!"}
{"text":"I eat here quite often.. In Scottsdale there is no finer place to eat sushi. No matter if you prefer rolls, sashimi or nigiri it's all good.  The quality, quantity, flavor, presentation and the consistency are what keep me coming back regularly. They also have amazing lunch specials."}
{"text":"Wow so good!!! I must've said it like 10 times throughout the meal. We ordered The Lord tuna roll, eel roll, and a tempura udon.   The udon was good and very flavorful. Tempura was also very crunchy and delicious. The only disappointment was that the shrimp was pretty small.  Both rolls were great!! I am especially in love with the tuna one since it had seared tuna on top. The fish was very fresh and everything just melted in my mouth.  To top everything off, they are running a 30% off special during dinner time and 20% off during lunch. The price was AMAZING for the quality and quantity of food that we got. I'm very sad that we're just here for business...but I will definitely be back before we leave!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Sushi J's only after the change in management, so I don't have a baseline for comparison. I thought the sushi was pretty good, but a bit pricey and the sushi rice was a tad too sweet. The quality of the tuna, salmon and scallop were great and I loved all the seared/torched nigiri we tried. Our server was almost too attentive, but he kept our waters and teas full so I cannot fault him for being friendly. It's good sushi but not the best sushi I've ever had, but so far, it's the best sushi I have tried in the Phoenix area (which isn't too hard, with a sample size of three). I'll have to try to the new place for comparison and report back."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is the dive bar of restaurants. Where do I start? The decor is terrible and its built inside of an old fast food restaurant. They say they have a full bar but I think they hide all of the booze in the back and don't really know what liquor they have. Not sure if they have a liquor license or not. I asked for a rum and coke, 10 minutes later the nice waiter came back and said they only have Pepsi. Who drinks a rum and Pepsi? Lol, I did and it was terrible. They have one speaker overhead and it is bumping gangster rap with all of the expletives. Something I'm down for listening to in my car or at home but in a sushi joint? C'mon! The sushi wasn't bad but the quality was on par with what you'd get from a Sprouts deli. There is no reason to go here; please save your money..."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about this place. Reason for 4 star is lack in service from the server, the quality of the fish & not many choices.  The manager Meggie was very nice enough to order special premium soju for us. The head sushi chef was very nice & tried to cater to what we like.  I must say, Saba was the best I've ever had anywhere else. Because so many things can go wrong with Saba, many restaurants/chef are afraid to make in house.  Yellow Tail was very fresh.  Tuna wasn't as good as they made it sound. It's Blue Fin but from Mexico. Because of the water temperature, it's not as good. Red/fresh in the center but outside changes to dark color really quick onece you cut it. Spicy Scallop was not what I would recommend. Very fishy but not heavy with mayo. Over all, it was a great experience.   Servers do need to pick up their slack. Recommend appetizers & informing happy hour would really help the customers have better experience."}
{"text":"Sushi J actually makes pretty darn good sushi, but for the price... it's hard to rate this super highly compared to other sushi restaurants that are equally priced but with a way cooler atmosphere. The prior establishment was seriously underpriced, and I'm sure that contributed to their move to Ahwautukee where the rent makes for more affordable sushi. I completely understand that to be located at this particular junction in Scottsdale can't be cheap, but it doesn't seem they're putting any of the extra dough by upping the sushi prices into the in-house vibe. There is an appeal to the \"hole-in-the-wall\" style venue for sure which is honestly well-kept and clean. But they don't handle rushes all that well, the service can be a little spotty, and I just have to say the wine list is awful (beer & wine only). Ok there, it's off my chest.  So after much exploration of the menu along with a mix of dine-in and takeout experiences, this is confidently my go-to sushi takeout place. The quality of the fish is quite above what I'd expect, and they make some great maki for sure. With that said, their online menu doesn't offer any descriptions of their specialty rolls. I've asked the hosts for takeout menus - which they don't have - so unless I want to go in person to look at the menu, wait for the whole order to be made, and then drive home, it's all up to memory. Lord of Tuna, Fire in the Mouth and a couple other staples are usual suspects - less because they are actually my favorite, more because those are the only ones I remember. They are always delicious though - I've never been disappointed in the quality.  I'd love to rank a small establishment like this with another star, but with the dine-in experience wanting for a little more and with how inaccessible they make the takeout process, here we are at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent! The staff is warm and attentive, sushi is very good and at a reasonable price. They welcome you with soup and salad included absolutely delicious! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Our Favorite restaurant. Maggie is the best hostess/waitress. She goes out of her way to make sure our dinners are great. The food here is the best sushi we've found in the valley. If you ever get the chance to order the special Tuna they have please do, you'll really enjoy it. Top it off with some green tea ice cream and you've got yourself a great evening. We're weekly visitors now, great happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"New to the Scottsdale area and decided to cruise around; stumbled upon Sushi J by accident. The staff are very cool and all the songs played so far have been good. I tried the Candy Cane roll, some King Salmon and Mackerel. It's all really good. Would highly recommend if you're in the mood for some fishies."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place a couple of times and have always enjoyed their sushi! Tastes fresh and ratio of rice to seafood is great!   Went here most recently the Friday night of the Super Bowl weekend, and we were seated right away. Waitress was nice but in training - but hey, we all gotta start somewhere. Only thin bad I have to say was that as delicious as fairly priced the food is, they were understaffed when we visited and ended up with longgg wait times for our food.   Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  There was no wait, the food came out super fast!!  Great quality!  We will for sure come again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and incredible happy hour specials ! Sunday and Monday Happy hour all night. Tuesday through Friday 5pm-7pm and Saturday 4pm to 7pm: $2.50-$7 appetizers, $5-$10 sushi rolls, and a ton of other specials! Food is delicious and the staff is so sweet. Fast, great service, incredible prices and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"House salad, soy wasabi dressing was on point.  Phx lite roll was a crab spring roll (rice paper wrapped) cut with a peanut sauce.  It was light, refreshing and the crab was sweet and fresh.  Shy guy roll was filled with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and avo, wrapped in cucumber then topped with seared tuna.  Delicious! Best order of the night though was the lightly seared salmon with ponzu and jalapeño.  The fish was so fresh, sweet and buttery.  Fantasticly executed and I will be coming back.  Love the unpretentiousness of the place and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We like sushi rolls, so this review is going to be skewed as someone who prefers sushi rolls :)  This place has a nice variety of rolls, a few with  no rice, and not everything is friend or has something fried inside of it, which is so refreshing.  They don't use too much rice on the rolls, and they give you a good amount of ingredients in each roll.  They don't over-sauce, which is so nice, as many places do as if they're apologizing their sushi tastes like fish!  We've liked every roll we've tried, but our favorites are:  Marilyn Monroll Candy Cane The Roll Monster Roll Fire in the Mouth Prince of Persia"}
{"text":"Wow, hidden gem in old town! the specialty rolls here are all extremely unique and there isn't an imitation crab in sight. The building is old and quite unimpressive but don't judge a book by its cover because inside lives a great restaurant. Service was good, and the alcohol selection wasn't too shabby either. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious sushi and the most courteous and helpful staff. We are happily regulars."}
{"text":"Finally a sushi place not far away from my place in Arizona that is actually really good.  I would highly recommend the Marilyn Mon-roll if you are looking for something on the light side with fresh crab and lobster.  If you are looking for a decadent roll, I would recommend the Candy Cane.  I can eat those again and again like I was addicted to a substance.  The prices are a little high, but it is the best sushi I have had in Arizona, hand down.  The ambiance is very quiet mood with a romantic type of lighting.  I would highly recommend going here for a date night."}
{"text":"Superior sushi, chefs, and service. Check out this Scottsdale gem. The sushi rolls offer a wide array of flavors both traditional and modern flare. I enjoy the Marilyn Monroll and Shy Guy. They are lighter fare and go really well with a refreshing beer. The service is attentive and had great suggestions."}
{"text":"So my brother gives this place a 10, Service, Amazing food, atmosphere. #SushiJ has it all!  Veggie egg rolls delish and spicy edamame.  We took him there for his birthday and they brought him a beautiful martini glass filled with green tea ice cream, whipped cream and a cherry. All present were impressed and will be back!  Oh, and happy hour on Monday's till 10!"}
{"text":"Such a great find!! Everything about our experience was awesome. Friendly staff and very accommodating.   Food was excellent and all the sushi tasted very fresh. My favorite roll was the \"Prince of Persia\" and it tasted as unique as the name. Typically at sushi restaurants the house salads are itty bitty and often served in a small bowl. Their house salad was a really nice portion served on a plate and the dressing was delicious and flavorful- it even has a little kick to it.   I can't wait to return to this spot. I'm definitely going to get the Prince of Persia again and try some more of their specialty rolls!"}
{"text":"I was greeted right away and the place was  nice and clean. The staff is friendly and hopeful. The food itself was amazing and I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and very yummy!! They can customize the rolls too. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I miss this place just writing about it.  Service was perfect, food was fantastic and the price wasn't bad.  If you love sushi - you will love Sushi J's"}
{"text":"went for a bachelor party with 20 guys, service was great.  They put up with us even though we were a little loud, thank you!"}
