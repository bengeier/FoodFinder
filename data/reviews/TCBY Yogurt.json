{"text":"I heard that TCBY stores were now carrying a dairy free soft serve (Silk almond milk chocolate!) and was super excited since non-dairy options are so hard to find! I posted a comment on the store's facebook asking if they had it in stock, and the owner replied saying that they did. The next day, my husband and I went to try it, but we were sad to see that the machine was marked out of order! They did have a kiwi strawberry sorbet, but my mouth was all ready for CHOCOLATE, so we reluctantly left. We made it to the curb before I changed my mind and decided to settle for the sorbet. When we came back in, the owner approached us and seemed to already know that I was the person from facebook! He apologized profusely and explained the problem with the machine (it needs a special temperature setting because the new non-dairy flavor freezes up at the old temp setting.) Because of this, the machine was off until it could be serviced, but he offered to turn it back on and give me a free one, even though it would probably be melty. It was, and the machine quickly froze back up again so I didn't get very much, but it was still delicious! And free (including toppings!) My husband got the sorbet with fruit in it, and it was REALLY good too!  Also, the new decor/style is very nice, and the serve yourself/pay by weight model is great! I cannot say enough good things about this place and its owner! We will be back ASAP! :)"}
{"text":"There are so many frozen yogurt parlors of this type sprouting up in Pittsburgh anymore that I can't get excited about them. Each one is self-serve, prices yogurt by weight, and features futurist decor in a casual setting with comfy leather couches everywhere.   TCBY (The Country's Best Yogurt) is differs from its contemporaries in that they are the forerunners. Founded in 1981 in Arkansas, I recall TCBY franchises first appearing in Pittsburgh in the early 90's, particularly in Oakland and Castle Shannon. Sometime after that, they seemingly vanished from the area. Now they've returned to show the other fro-yo joints how it's done...by copying them. This isn't the TCBY of my youth.   Kay tried the silk almond milk chocolate and loved it. Meanwhile, I did what I always do at these establishments: pour several flavors into a cup along with an array of toppings since I can never decide on one thing. I end up creating a sundae that tastes like everything, with no single component being discernible. A swirling storm of the rich, sweet, and cold results.   Eh, I'm preferring ice cream, and I'm increasingly  preferring it housemade these days. Otherwise, why go to an ice cream parlor? If I can buy it at the supermarket...  P.S. Strangely enough, a Cold Stone Creamery used to sit a few doors down from where TCBY is now but never quite caught on."}
