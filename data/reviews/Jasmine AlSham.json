{"text":"This review is coming from someone who has lived in the Middle East and basically grew up eating Arabic food, this's one of the best middle eastern restaurants in town. Forget about all those chains and come and try this."}
{"text":"Great place with classic middle Eastern fast food
We stopped by for lunch, and the food was really good. More flavourful and  not as greasy as compared to a popular Boustan. Everything was very fresh. Stuff friendly. And the whole place was very clean. Definitely recommend, we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place, and I am not disappointed!  Freshly grilled to perfection.

Have taken out from here a few times and have always ordered the family grill special (sometimes ordered 2 specials if hosting lunch at home) that includes potatoes, rice, 4 chicken on skewers, 4 kaftas, 2 filet mignons on skewers, pita, garlic potatoes with onions, and 2 salads (red green yellow peppers, red onion, turnip, radish, tomatoes, cucumbers, in oil).  Also comes with 4 small containers of hummus, 4 garlic sauce.  On top of all this goodness, is a pile of pitas cut into triangles with some kind of spicy filling.  Very, very good!

Not sure if it was required, but when I needed a couple specials, I called it in in advance, 1 day notice, and was ready for the time I asked for.  Even when ordered as a walk-in, it was still very quick - 15-20 mins wait for the whole thing to be packaged.  Although, one time, when asked for rice and potatoes, I opened it up and only received potatoes.  No biggie - the potatoes are clean (not burnt, no blackness), flavourful, and eating it with the garlic sauce was delish.  Each meat was more flavourful than the next!  (Prepare yourself with gum for after the meal ;) ).

I will still continue to come here, but, the prices keep going up in such short intervals of time - because of this, it may sway my decision a few times when ordering for a group...But I get it, meat prices have gone up :(."}
{"text":"I dream about the sham platter! One of the most inspired takeaway restaurants we have had in a long time. Everything is so fresh and flavourful, the staff is friendly and the prices are amazing."}
{"text":"I happened to be passing through Montreal West Island & fell on this small restaurant. I was attracted by the name since my favourite flower is Jasmin as well as my Disney hero.  I got in with skepticism since I am very critical of middle eastern food. I had the Shawerma sandwich, I have to admit it was the best I ever tasted. The owner also presented me with his Taouk sandwich on a saj bread ( it's a flat thin bread ).
Every dish including the salads were delicious. I totally recommend this place."}
