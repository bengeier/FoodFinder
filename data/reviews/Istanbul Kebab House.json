{"text":"Tonight my husband and I tried the Istanbul Kebab House for the first time and we loved it. The atmosphere was quiet, although towards the end it was punctuated with pleasant Turkish music. 

We had hummus and pita as an appetizer and we loved it. It was so tangy - not bland or dry like some hummous. We also had a pot of traditional Turkish tea and it was delightful to drink them from glass cups.

My husband had chicken kebab, which came with a slice of rustic bread, rice and salad. My musaka also came with the same sides. I have never had musaka like this - the eggplant was cut open and the ingredients placed inside instead of it being baked in a pan. Traditional Greek moussaka usually leaves me feeling too full, but this was perfect! I even had room for dessert. My husband had rice pudding, which was served in a clay bowl, and I had baklava, which was drizzled with chocolate syrup. Now that was a first!

We purchased a traditional tea set as well. The Istanbul Kebab House sells backgammon boards, samovars, small hookahs and traditional Turkish coffee pots. Overall, the food was very good and the bill wasn't more than an average chain restaurant. We had wonderful service and would definitely go again. There's lots on the menu to try!"}
{"text":"This is another place I'd like to give a 4, but can't. So it gets a 3.5 from me. 
The menu was expansive, so as usual, it took me forever to figure out what I wanted. First we ordered the borek between the 3 of us to start. We ordered feta and we got spinach instead. Also, being used to the eastern european type borek which is made of phyllo and has more cheese, this baked one with really not much in it, was underwhelming. And so salty we couldn;t finish. Salty seemed the theme for the evening. Now, usually it's just me, but the other girls with me LOVE salt, and even they too found it salty.
My one gf had the eggplant stuffed with ground beef. It was the best of all the dishes and the least salty. I had the lamb kabob, and again couldn't finish due to the salt. My other gf has a vegetarian pite, which was - you guessed it - salty.
I did enjoy the small side of rice and sald that rounded off the meal. And I know they use quality ingredients, because if this had not all tasted oversalted, the meals would have gotten a 4 or 5 star review from me. I've never used the word salt so many times in a paragraph. Anyways, I would try this again, just to see if maybe it was an off night, and since the menu had many other tasty items to choose from."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The hummus is amazing, and the service is great!  My husband and I come here quite often and have turned several friends on to Turkish food."}
{"text":"Great cleaning Turkish food. Yummy. Highly recommend if you want tasty food."}
{"text":"Best Turkish food in town. Islander is my entire family's favourite. Comparable to Mustafa but this place has more variety. However, Mustafa portions are much bigger. This place is always packed. If you come on a weekend day, expect at least an hour wait. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Found myself at this gem of a place as part of a UYE organized by the new spokesperson for Salabat, @Sabz. 

In short, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Istanbul. It is a relatively small place as there are maybe 10 tables within the establishment. I had the Kuzu (Lamb) Kabob ($13.95) and Turkish Coffee ($2.95). This was one of the best kabobs I've ever had. The lamb was juicy and tender, cooked to perfection. The coffee was perfect. So good that it brought me back to the last time I had this kind of coffee (it's been a few years). 

Our party ordered all sorts of goodies and everything looked stellar, especially the desserts. Service is excellent. The cooks are hard at work and take the time to wipe everything down in the kitchen. Great little restaurant. I really could be a regular here. It's on the list to bring my sister to the next time she is in town. 

Beware the love tester machine! Some hands are more desperate than others. ^_^"}
{"text":"I happened to this side of town and passed by Istanbul Kebab House. This restaurant definitely did not disappoint. Love the decor inside and the food is amazing too ! A must try if you are in this neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Excellent food quality 
We definitely return to this restaurant as it was a flash back long time a go in Istanbul."}
{"text":"This place definitely has the middle eastern hospitality when it comes to their servers and cooks, they were very nice. I took my inlaws their on a Saturday evening for their anniversary celebration dinner, we were a group of 6. We arrived at the restaurant at 7:50 and got seated at 8:45. We ordered appetizers Baba ganoush, meat pides and the mixed meat platter, we also asked for burgul, but they told us they ran out and we replaced it with rice, and it was cold when served. Baba ganoush came out without the bread, and when the bread was served after reminding the server a few times it was fresh but cold, however, the Baba ganoush was delicious! We received our meat pides without utensils or napkins, we had to remind the server to serve us necessary things that they were supposed to serve initially, so they were not at the top of their game, they had very slow and sloppy service due to the amount of people that were there and shortage of servers. 

As we were eating our pide, a server told us that they had ran out of the veil and lamb doner and chicken shish and asked us if it was ok to replace it with the other meats they had available, we agreed. After waiting for almost another hour and seeing people that came after us being served their meat platters, we went up to the cooks themselves and told them we no longer want our orders and wanted to leave and they apologized and told us they had a mix up in the orders from the servers and promised us that if it wasn't out in one minute than we could leave (didn't even give us anything on the house) we were so hungry and frustrated with waiting, that by the time we received our platters (took them two minutes) it didn't look appetizing anymore.  The meat was tender and seasoned well, but I didn't really care for the chicken wings on that platter, chicken wings aren't really a part of Turkish cuisine so it didn't make sense to me for them to serve it. Also, we were first timers and weren't even told or served our complimentary tea after our meal.

So here's the thing with this place, excellent food..bad service (and that's where their rating took a hit). And as we all know, with any successful restaurant..good food and good customer service go hand in hand, you cannot have one without the other! And that's where middle eastern restaurants tend to take a hit in their business, it's because they cheapen out on waiters and lack customer service and some lack restaurant management skills (aside from Paramount). So let's review the restaurant now that we reviewed their food. 

As you walk into the restaurant, people are crammed in the small entrance, waiting for a table. You have to put your name on a waiting list, but you have to hunt down the host because he is also a server. So in the entrance area is where they have the fridge full of beverages and a shelve storage unit full of glasses and cups where they serve their water and complementary tea from, now imagine crammed customers on the waiting list waiting in that small space and servers trying to get in and out serving people beverages from that area? Can you imagine the chaos and inconvenience for the customers and servers? In the entrance area, there's also a hallway that spilts horizontally where the bathrooms and a storage room for cleaning supply's and a door for the kitchen. When I went to the bathroom after finishing our meal, it was clean but there were dry and wet paper towels all over the floor, but that's for the uncivilized people to blame for since they can't throw their Garbage in the trash. 

This restaurant has a lot of potential, but they need a system on weekends the method of first come first serve does not work in a small space with large volumes such as this place, because then the service and wait time
becomes ridiculous and this is probably the reason why I won't go back there again. I think this place need to implement a reservation policy only on weekends, and if anyone does show up and wants to dine in, and they have a no-show or empty table, they can seat them or else they can notify them on the wait time for a table to open up (depending on other reservation times/people who are leaving) but having to be crammed in a small waiting area and not knowing your wait time and running  out of food is simply unacceptable!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. 
Don't skip desserts. 
Don't forget to ask for a complimentary tea 
It's super busy in the weekend, try to go during the week. 


Highly recommend.

Best Turkish food ever"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of colleagues for lunch.  I'll cut to the chase, the food is excellent. I tried the Urfa Kebab and my colleague had the chicken sandwich.  They were both really good.  The portions are quite large and the food is very filling.  The staff were very friendly and the place has a \"family owned\" sense to it.  I ordered an Ayran (made in house) with my meal and that too was very good.  We didn't try their desserts but did have tea which was served in the estekan (hour glass cup).  My meal was $13 and the sandwich was $7.  Will definitely come back and try the Eskandar kebab. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is average. Staff is very unprofessional and takes too long to serve. Wait time is average 45 mins."}
{"text":"During my travels to Turkey this summer, I discovered the world of Turkish cuisine and had one of those moments that made me weep with joy and despair. Joy because I'd just discovered something amazing, and despair because I will soon return to my Canadian Prairie lands where this amazingness may never be found again. 

Once I was back in Calgary, I scoured the Internet and stumbled upon the LONE Turkish restaurant in this city. \"UYE!\" I thought, \"I must share my discovery with the world!\"

And so we arrived, a group of hungry, curious Yelpers, at this modest establishment. I was quite happy with how low-key the restaurant was. I would be leery if they tried to fancy up the place and 'take you on a Turkish journey', as such places usually fall short. This wasn't the case with this restaurant. We had a table reserved for our big group, and we definitely took up more than half the restaurant.

I was also happy with the menu because it did seem to have most of the food they serve in the restaurants in Istanbul. Our group ordered appies, kebabs, moussakas, hummus, some chicken dishes and beef-stuffed eggplant. My lamb kebap was amazing. Very flavourful, tender and substantial. We savoured every bite. The rice was spot-on. Sounds silly, but there is something about Turkish rice... it's darn good.

We ended our meals with an array of desserts. My dessert was a variation of the Kunefe.. an individual sized portion of angel-hair vermicelli baked in sweet syrup and slightly stuffed with cheese. It came piping hot to our table (they had just baked it just for me!) and my goodness, it was HEAVENLY. I silently shed tears of joy. 

Apart from the delicious food, what also deserves mention is how friendly the owner (I forget his name!) is. An older, happy-looking man running the kitchen with what seemed like his family. Adorable! The kitchen seemed very clean too, and we were VERY impressed to see one of the guys in the kitchen scrubbing down the side of the fridge towards the end of his shift.

I am incredibly happy I found this restaurant, and my Turkish food love affair doesnt have to end. If you like mediterranean food expertly made in a cozy, homey atmosphere, go to Istanbul Kebab House. And tell the owner you had a fantastic meal - he seems genuinely happy to hear it."}
{"text":"After Sabahat came back from her magical Turkish Vacation with Turkish Delights in a pretty white satchel for me, she decided that the best way to describe Turkey to us landlocked souls; was to have us partake in their cuisine. Which is true for any culture! And while Calgary can only boast one Turkish restaurant in all of its 726.5 square km, I'm glad to say; it's an excellent lone Turkish restaurant! 

On first appearance, it looks a little dive-y. But, don't let that dissuade you! Inside, it's remarkably clean (as are the bathrooms!) with an open kitchen and the most adorable old man in the universe making all the dishes; flanked by two sous chefs. The kitchen takes up a great deal of the space, so the dining area is a little small, but they managed to accomodate our large group excellently. Even despite the fact that there is only one waitress. 

I wasn't feeling particularly hungry when we arrived, so I ordered a couple of light dishes to go with my traditional Turkish Tea; Sarma (Turkish dolmades) and Börek, a spinach and herb stuffed pita that came out looking and tasting like a Turkish Quesadilla sans cheese. The Börek was a little on the salty side, but this was easily remedied with one of the lemon slices that garnished the plate of Sarmas. The Sarmas tasted quite different from Greek Dolmades, which are bright and lemony. These were a little more on the savory side, but equally delicious. 


While I was eating, everyone else's amazing looking dishes; piled high with fried rice and pitas made me wish I had ordered a main dish like everyone else. The vegan options are minimal there, but the kitchen is extremely accommodating and there are tons of ~*secret menu items*~ you can request... if you're savvy and (with the help of Sabahat) talk the business owner in to posing for a picture with you. 

I got over my dinner envy when dessert time rolled around! 

Angelo and Danelle ordered Baklavas filled with nuts and Rosewater syrup. Ange's friend ordered Sütlaç (rice pudding). Sabz and I ordered the Künefe, a pastry with angel hair-thin dough sprinkled on thin layers of dough and baked with nuts and Rosewater syrup. Sabz got a ~*secret menu*~ 1up and got hers with melted cheese on the bottom. One bite and I was already lamenting that there wasn't more of it on the plate. Share?!?! Back off, unless you want to be wearing my fork home!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent quality. The meat was very juicy and tender. We got the chicken güveç and mixed grill platter."}
{"text":"We showed up at 7:30pm and were seated at 9:30pm after being told it was a 45 minute wait.

We were a group of 8 and wanted to order the mixed grill and were then told they had no doner left to serve.

Tea is complimenatery which was also not served to us at the end of the meal.

To top it all off, the waiter touched my stomach and said not to worry after I had asked to get bread for the table - this was highly inappropriate.

Service - 1/10
Food - 7/10"}
{"text":"Has a good Iskander Kebab,
but not the best kofta 
Clean place"}
{"text":"Beef and Veal doner, and Adana were the orders today.  Food was remarkable .. the staff seemed tired, and hence a bit unfriendly .. may be if they could be trained for some extra effort, smile, and pay attention to the customer. Overall a great place to dine at."}
{"text":"Heard about IKH repeatedly from different Freinds. And today I decided to try it for launch. 

First, the high thump for the nice well explained pictures for each dish in the menu, and some wall pictures for Istanbul city which add nice spirit to the place. 

In general, it is a decent place. Simple designed very comfy chairs and clean floors. 

Service is just awesome! Waiting for an impression from you to serve. 

Food 
Bread baskets served hot from oven right with Baba ghanoog which was perfectly balanced in taste. 

Iskander kabab, quality of beef and portions of bread, butter and beef were excellent and overall delicious. 

Adana kebab, with burgol, again the quality of food and grilling is amazing. 

Donier Pide, 
Turkish Pastry with beef shawarma shredded on top of the cheese. Crunchy and soft. Good for 2 ppl 

Laban Ayran, was fresh not very salty. 

For sure I highly recommend this restaurant and I will check in again and again."}
{"text":"First time here and the place is clean, fresh and welcoming. Menu has so many interesting items I will have to come back. For example they got all kinds flat bread \" pizza\"s per say. They got wide selection of meats to go with anything from a sandwich to the flat break or party plates. Prices are reasonable. 8 to 15$ gets u a very wide selection of food. Only let down was service which was kinda slow but then improved. Don't forget to ask for your complementary tea at the end of the meal !"}
{"text":"-The food is 4/10 to be honest. 
- We waited 45 mnts to be seated. I was looking forward to ordering Iskender but after all that wait I was told they ran out of doner. So I ordered Kofte which was dry and bland. My food was somewhat cold as well. The rice that came with my order was clumpy. My wife ordered the urfa kebab which was decent. 
-Their appetizers are an absolute joke! We had the rusu salata and an egg plant salad, both were about 8 dollars each and they came out on very tinnnnny plates. I could not believe the portion size. They did not taste that great either.
- Ordered Ayran to drink which came out in a tiny glass and was bland and luke warm. Asked for ice but was told they don't have any!!
- They did not serve the complimentary tea at the end until they were asked for it. Simply the service sucks at this place.
- Also, they got my bill wrong and ended up charging me $15 extra which I didn't notice was on there until I got home. So I was charged more on top of their already pricey food.
- I might give this place one more try because of the hype around it from everyone else but I was not impressed with my first visit at all."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 star , yes , and I highly recommend this restaurant  , they have a great variety of delicious and healthy meals . The server very friendly . The ambience is very nice and cozy . The service was excellent ! Thumbs up ! Keep up the good job guys ."}
{"text":"Nothing says low-key like having your restaurant in the deep pocket of the North of Calgary in an area where people have to boil their water, or so I've heard. But kudos to Sabahat Supreme for organizing this UYE because Lord knows I rarely have time to commit to these UYE's lately, but when SABZ puts one on, you know it's a party!

The decor of the restaurant is unpretentious. It's simple and doesn't try to establish a dining feel but the open kitchen is quite welcoming. There is a massive sign above showing the various feature dishes to give you an idea of what you'll be ordering.

I ordered their Turkish tea, stuffed eggplant, and baklava. The tea was alright but the eggplant, which was served with freshly prepared rice and salad, was exquisite and delectable. It was stuffed with ground meat and topped with cheese and wasn't heavily seasoned that I got sick of it after a few bites. Their baklava was different from other baklava I've had before. It was buttery but it wasn't too sweet. Not that it wasn't a good thing. For it's larger serving, it made a light dessert to have.

The only downside to this place is \"the love machine\". The first quarter told me I was \"passionate\" and being unsatisfied because Sabz mocked me the second quarter yielded me a...nvm I don't wanna tell this STUPID story."}
{"text":"I've never been to this part of town, especially by bus!, but when Sabahat suggested a UYE to a Turkish restaurant, I couldn't say no. It's hidden in a little strip mall and still took me a few minutes to find on foot. 

The restaurant is tiny - our table took up more than half of what they had available. But they were very accommodating, especially since people kept arriving to dinner after the first group had arrived. 

The menu was expansive and everything sounded great - I changed my mind several times before finally settling on a meal. 

I had the little rice pieces wrapped in olive leafs for an appetizer - yum! Maybe a tad less flavourful than I've had elsewhere but overall a good pick. And then had a chicken dish for my main. Followed by baklava for dessert.

Even though we were there after close, they were very patient and the server was around often. 

It's a bit of a trip but I'd make another visit if I were in the area or craving some turkish food."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my mom and sisters since this place is always packed. We went on Sunday around lunch time and it wasn't too busy. 

We ordered the veal and lamb doner dinner, doner pide and the yogurt kebab from the bbq section. 

The veal and lamb doner dinner was amazing, it came with a ton of meat. The doner pide was good but nothing amazing. It's mozzarella cheese with some meat on top.
The yogurt kebab was good too, but it didn't come with any pita bread, only bread chunks in the yogurt dip. But after asking for some bread, they brought us a bunch free of charge. 

I would definitely return for the doner dinner plate."}
{"text":"I have tried almost all the Turkish restaurant in Toronto and the surrounding areas, and this on is by far the best. I had the lentil soup, iskender kebab, mezze platter, chai & kunefe. All around the food was very good. I would definitely recommend this place. I will be going back for sure. I'd be there every week but I live downtown and they don't deliver here."}
{"text":"Tip:  Parking lot is more accessible if you're headed East on Dundas OR South on Dixie.  Otherwise, it can be tricky to get into the parking lot of this L-shaped plaza.

It was quite bustling on a Friday evening for dinner!  There was a bit of a wait to get in.

Interior has been recently renovated with exposed brick and dark interior.  So not at all what you'd expect from the area!  There is even an actual wood burning stove in their open kitchen.  You can see men rolling out dough for pides (Turkish pizzas).

Service, not sure if it's due to a language barrier / busyness, could've been a bit more attentive.  Asked for water and knife and didn't receive either, but we made due.  However, the man making the pides did ask how everything was when we were walking out, so I think they DO care.  Just don't expect too much.

We ordered:  Chicken Shish ($14) & Urfa Kebabs ($13).  Grilled meats were done just right, tender and moist, not dried out like some places.  Salad was fresh and dressing was just enough!  

My only complaint about the food was that some elements were plated beforehand, e.g. slices of pita underneath meat and bulgur, were colder than room temp.  Pita pieces were chewy as opposed to fresh and soft.  I did tell the Pide-man about the temperature of the bulgur.  Again, it was tasty, but just not warm enough.

If they worked a bit more on their cs and temperature, it would be a complete 5*s.

Based on the patrons, this place seemed very authentic!"}
{"text":"I lived up round these parts for nearly three years and never set foot in any of the spots in the strip mall on 4th St NW. Apparently it takes a UYE from one of my fellow Yelpers to change that!

Istanbul Kebab House... you can so call me a fan. And a fan of the pricing too. It was solid home-made tasting food with a price tag that was easy to swallow. When I say solid home-made tasting, I mean it was freshly made and served right away and had that sense of TLC and satisfaction that any good home-cooked meal will bring you no matter the cuisine.

I started with a salad that I can no longer remember the name of, but it came with four olives on top and had just a light drizzling of dressing on top. Next came my lamb kebab, served with a bit more salad, rice and what I'm going to call naan (not sure if that's what it still gets to be called in a Turkish spot?). My lamb came on a mighty skewer. It kind of made me want to have sword fights with others at the table... but alas, I had better behave.

The restaurant itself is tiny. We were a group of 8 I think and I'm pretty sure we got the only big table in the whole place. The kitchen also gives a whole new outlook to the open kitchen concept, or maybe it's the old outlook? At any rate, the chef/owner and his underlings were all right there, cooking away. You can smile and wave to them over the counter. You can also see them scrubbing every last inch of the restaurant as they get ready to close for the night. I don't think that was for our benefit, I think they're just that clean!

At the end of our meal, our lovely little server girl came around with some kind of lemon smelling oil stuff for our hands. No idea what it's called, but I want to say it was kind of like a hand sanitizer, except it leaves your skin much softer and better smelling."}
{"text":"We tried this place after intrigued by yelp reviews, and I must say, it was a really good call. 
Their platters are phenomenal and the Ayran was not at all stale like in most other places. 
Our server helped us navigate the menu since there are quite a few options and the food arrived all together after not a very long wait. Overall: much recommended"}
{"text":"I regret not taking photos on this visit , but That is my excuse for going back. The food was sublime we shared Adana Kabab ,Iskander Kabab, eggplant kabab , cheese pide , and the glorious pastirma pide. We followed the food up with kunefe and coffee ( or tea ). Everything was was delicious , the kunefe was not too sweet ... it was just right. Value for money was good 130$ for 5 people. We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was a substantial line up. Someone in the line said that it was worth the wait ... and they were right !"}
{"text":"I came here with my fiancé on a whim. Everything we ordered was completely delicious. We had a plate of mixed dips, lentil soup, my fiancé had some kind of meat sandwich, and I had the spinach cheese pide. Holy moly I haven't been that full and satisfied in a while. Oh and the rice pudding is now one of my favourite desserts of life."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The food tasted of excellent quality ingredients and composition. The menu is nice with images. Rice pudding was lovely too. Pyde was excellent too particularly the meat of round discs was beautifully spiced."}
{"text":"As you walk in, you'll find the smell of freshly baked pides (Turkish pizza) in wood fire stoves, aromas of tea and coffee, and the chatter to families enjoying an afternoon meal. Greeted by the warmth of Turks, as you glance over to the kitchen you'll find craftsmen kneading dough and preparing kebabs and it's spices.

Their Iskender (or IsTender ok bad joke. ..) melts in your mouth, the pides comes out hot, crispy and soft on the inside, and their baba ganoush rich and flavorful. At the end of the meal, tea is served and you can decide whether you have enough space for one of their delightful desserts. This is one of my favorite joints in Mississauga and I hope you'll find this experience as wonderful."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best place in Ontario for Turkish food, very authentic and delicious. Place, service and people were great. We enjoyed the food the exact same way that we did have in Turkey. We will be there again soon"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The service is bad. The cleanness of the restaurant and the washroom are bad. Under the tables there are many food miss. The plates are not very clean. The waiting is very bad they dont know how to give people turns to sit, there is like fighting outside. Too noisy. The people who are waiting are on the hole way. I think they need to learn from other restaurants experience."}
{"text":"OK, so I had high hopes for this place and it was just one disappointment after the other... The service in the afternoon time when it's hardly busy was absolutely garsley.. We had to keep asking 4 to 5 different waiters for every small thing.. The order took ages... We waited over 30 minutes for just one main course which was kinda ridiculous...the food is very very average.. The soup was totally bland.. The bread wasn't freshly made even when we ordered extra.. And our main course chicken had dullness to its core.. Absolutely no flavor, not even salt.. Hardly any veggies inside at all.. Im really bummed to say I won't be coming back..oh yeh n I didn't get my complimentary tea.."}
