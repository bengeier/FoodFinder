{"text":"Had a great soup tonight!  Roasted red pepper with parmesan and rice.  So tasty and really hit the spot on a cold night.  Salad was very fresh.  Large portions, great prices.  In my worst Arnold Schwartzenegger voice...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was just in town for a nights stay at the Ramada and decided to grab some food at the hotel restaurant, Mr D's. I was approached by the owner, who was extremely friendly and entertaining. I could tell immediately that this man took much pride in his restaurant, especially in his menus and food. Even though I only got take out, (I exaggerate you not) I had the best sandwich I have ever tasted. It was the called \"The Adventurer\", which was concocted by the owner himself. I was shocked to hear that even though he hasn't eaten meat in the past 14 years would be able to design a meat sandwich with sirloin steak, mushrooms, French fries, and a dabble of horseradish to taste so delicious. Seems as though vegetarians have no issues inventing tasty food for meat eaters. Anyhow, I rest my case. I had such a good experience I had to jot it somewhere. I hope you guys find this helpful."}
{"text":"I was at the Ramada for a convention, but the most interesting thing to do was hang out at the bar and get sloshed.   Due to understaffing, service was poor. The bartender was very overwhelmed and couldn't keep up with drink orders at happy hour, and very literally walked past me when I was holding up my hand for another pint.  While I appreciate that they had rogue dead guy and great lakes on tap, I did not appreciate them forgetting to give me happy hour pricing on my two drinks.   The food I got to go was decent, considering they had an off-menu food order list for the convention that was cheap. But that wasn't enough to overlook the service issue.  I hope they plan better for larger groups in the future."}
{"text":"Tried their Buffalo Wings by recombination. Literally ate at Buffalo Wild Wings for lunch so I thought...Why would I want to eat wings at this small hole in the wall place after I had wings from one of my favorite places? But I tried them and I can honestly say their wings put BDubs to SHAME!! Definitely recommend!!! Also doesn't hurt they've got a very pretty bartender Jessica who is AMAZING! Surprised to see her working behind this bar rather than working as a super model!"}
