{"text":"My first impression of Loi Nam is very poor. It looks so rundown. It is nothing compared with Leelee or Mekong. But I give Loi Nam 5 stars for its homemade food. I could have given 10 stars if it was an option.  Born and raised in Vietnam for 18 years, I know how Vietnamese cuisine should be.  Their Hue-style rice noodle, Bún Bò Hu, is exceptionally good. It was such a surprise to me. Many Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix area managed to get the beef noddle soup, Ph, to a nice level but the rest of the menu were just wrong. Loi Name's Hue-style rice noodle is not only over the top delicious, it also comes in a very generous portion. $5 for a takeout that fills up a huge bowl. Nobody can beat that.  Steam buns, Bánh Bao, are to die for. The flour is moist, sweet, soft. The meat is just right.  Vietnamese specialty dessert, mung-bean ball (sorry don't really know the real English name), chè Trôi Nc, gave me a jaw-dropping experience. Huge ball of soft, chewy flour, with mashed mung-bean inside in sweet ginger flavored sauce. Served with coconut milk. Never ever I had chè Trôi Nc this good in the U.S. (and I tried almost everything in Little Saigon, CA).  Very difficult Ph to make, chicken noodle soup, comes with eggs (trng gà non). Real Vietnamese chick noodle soup would not miss these special type of eggs.  Loi Nam's food draw me to their store again and again. Not only they know how to cook real Vietnamese food, they choose to do it correctly, with focus on detail. They wouldn't skip any ingredient.  However, there is a hassle to get to these good food. The owner, ch By,  doesn't cook the same food everyday. I have to call in to make an order for the next day pickup. I asked her why she doesn't make the food more available. She said she only makes the food fresh and sell within a day. The next day, some food won't remain the same quality she would like (like chè Trôi Nc if refrigerated the flour would get hard and must be microwaved before eating, hence reduce taste).   It is best to call when you're nearby and ask what she has for the day. If you're lucky you'll get some real specialty food."}
{"text":"Two Words. Banh Bao  Beyond the beat down appearance and rough exterior lies an Asian grocery store that can satisfy your basic needs for Asian cooking.  The owners are great and very friendly and you can count on good suggestions and even a little cultural history on Vietnamese cuisine.  Aside from the groceries that are present with your can goods, spices, fresh Asian vegetables, and your selection of meats and seafood, what should draw you in is the small display of cooked and prepared foods in the back.  When ready and fresh are delicious and convenient to buy and take home to eat for dinner which will save you the time to prepare these Vietnamese dishes.  For me the hidden gem of Phoenix and Arizona is there Banh Bao.  This is a steamed Asian pastry filled with barbeque and steam pork with quarter of a hard boiled egg.  When eaten fresh out of the oven, the ingredients melt in your mouth combining the sweetness of the dough mixed with the savoriness of the pork meat.  I only wish this was made daily."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this little market for quite a while now, and finally decided to go check it out. What a gem. It doesn't look like much form the outside, but is truly a great little market for the area. It's filled wiht tons of Asian staples, an entire aisle of different noodles and a pretty good meat/fish window. This is very reminiscent of the litle market's I'd frequent in Seattle/Tacoma growing up. Don't be turned off by the crappy exterior and parking lot, trust me it's worth walking in."}
{"text":"If I live a few miles closer I would go here every day at least. I love their live fish tank. Live talapias are the main reason I go here. The owners are nice and friendly as well as the staff."}
