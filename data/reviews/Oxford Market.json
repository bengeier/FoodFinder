{"text":"Grabbed the All Cheese white pizza. Consists of fresh mozzarella, grated parmesan, crumbled smoked blue cheese and roasted garlic ricotta. The dough was light and soft with a slight crunch on the outside edges. Overall delicious and perfect size for lunch, to-go or at the bar side with drinks! Ordering at the kiosk wasn't bad. If you've ever ordered at GetGo or Sheetz it's the same concept. Expect to wait a little longer during lunch time. The overhead screen of your station will have your number and will turn green when ready!"}
{"text":"If you work downtown, this new lunch spot is worth checking out! Oxford Market is the latest eatery to open in the lower level of One Oxford Centre. It may have taken longer than expected to open, but it was worth the wait. My coworkers love it and given the crowds I've seen, so do our neighbors.  Oxford Market is a made-to-order, customizable food court featuring a total of five food stations. Each station specializes in something different, giving you a good range of lunch options to order from! Guests must place their order at a kiosk rather than ordering from the stations themselves. Most kiosks are at the entrance of the Market but a few are scattered inside it as well. Feel free to order from more than one station at a time, too! Just remember to grab a drink and snacks before ordering - these are located in coolers and stands throughout the market and need to be scanned as part of your whole order.  So what do the stations themselves have to offer? Piccola Italia offers pasta and pizza; Market Fresh offers a salad bar (note that you make and weigh your salads, versus the ordering process for the other eateries); Flame seems to strike the American comfort food vein with protein-based sandwiches and fries; and the other two stations (who I sadly cannot name off the top of my head - I'll have to add their names later) offer Thai-inspired cuisine and tacos. All made fresh, all made to order, all made based on what you want! Yum!  In the future Oxford Market hopes to host food trucks as \"travel chefs\" or chefs of the week. This is definitely something I'm looking forward to - although even without the featured cooks, this place has PLENTY of tasty goodness to offer. Do check them out and consider them as a lunch option!"}
{"text":"Finally something near my work location that is good and fresh. I haven't tried everything, I mainly go to the salad bar and the Taco place. This place you order on a kiosk and pay at it. Also does not take cash, which is perfect. I dont like talking to people and never carry cash so purfect for me.    The salad bar is nice, fresh ingredients and a good variety. I go here instead of Hello Bistro, cheaper and less of a wait time. There is always something different on the salad bar and nice selection of items.   The taco place is a fav, different toppings to choose from and the best thing is Kiosks through out the place to order food. Its 2 tacos for 5$ which is one of the better deals downtown.   Give it a shot, good for a nice lunch and cheap."}
{"text":"Tried a new station this today at the Oxford Market, TACOS!!! Oh how you know I love tacos.  I had two pork tacos with guacamole, switched it up, had one with the cabbage slaw and other with kale and pineapple. Yummy!!   The tacos are served on flour shells not homemade but delicious nonetheless. There is roughly 9 or so toppings to choose from, keeping it simple. Outside of pork you can get, chicken, veggies, or shrimp ($1 more).   The one down I have is, I ordered a side of queso and chips to go with. The size of the queso was a joke. I definitely am not looking for a huge side but they should think of at least giving you a \"chipotle\" size side cup of sauce or less chips because my ratio was clearly off.  All in all once again Oxford Market has impressed"}
{"text":"In the dust of the formerly located Easy Street rose this array of made to order and take out fast foods that can easily be overwhelming. Please note that this place opens at 11 for lunch on weekdays.  Since there weren't a lot of people around when I arrived I walked though the market to get an idea of their different cuisines as well as grab and go items and snacks. As others have mentioned, there is an Italian station, a taco station, and a sandwich station called \"Flame\"(Just look at their buns with their name branded on them) which specializes in burgers, fish, and yes they serve a bean/quinoa style burger. The station I decided to try is actually a duel concept. One is Mediterranean called Zatar, and the other is Revolution where you can \"build\" your own noodle bowls. In the middle towards the back is the salad bar which I understood is pay what it weighs. I have yet to figure the cost. No one seemed to know who was sitting around me. Everything is customizable.  I knew to purchase the beverages separately but as I made my way around I didn't see any prices to go with them. The same was true with the grab and go candy or grab and go refrigerated items (similar to what you would find at an airport.) I did purchase a bottle of water for $1.89.  I asked for help and was told to order off one of the kiosks and if I wasn't pleased with the price of the item, then just take it off my order. Beverages you buy also had to be scanned. I wanted to pay cash but was told there was no cashier. I pointed to one of the employees what was written on the sign in the entry way but he said if I wanted to pay cash then I would have to pay in the bar.  Zatar and Revolution have quick change light menus on the same board so it becomes a bit difficult when ordering. I was able to ask one of cooks to assist me. The shrimp looked delicious and he helped me with the kiosk in ordering a bowl made with rice noodles, shrimp, my choice of broth, and 4 add ons of my choice. Once you pay your receipt is given a number that appears on a lit board. When your number turns from red to green then your order is ready. If you don't want to fool with the board then they can text you if you provide your cell number.   Since most of the people were going for sandwiches I got my broth bowl fairly quickly. I must stress that although some things here may say \"vegan\" I was told \"vegetarian\" instead because things could be compromised. There's inside seating in the foyer outside market. All your plastic utensils and napkins are situated inside near the center of the market.  I felt my rice noodles were under cooked and not very tender. The shrimp however, made up for that error. They were nice size and still had their tails on them. You get 5 of them in your bowl. The broth bowl was filled to the brim and did have a bit of a \"kick\" to it with the Thai chili sauce he put in it. The other vegetables were in there but they seemed to be mostly shavings.  This place does catering and they have a phone number you can call them for that service. I went to the bar area when I was finished to search out a restroom and began to chat with the bar lady. She told me that I could have eaten my meal in here since they have both tables set up parallel to the bar. She also told me the Oxford Bar starts their own meal service at 3 pm and is open until 10 pm. Since they had opened two weeks ago she told me there were becoming more popular at night.   There is no restroom in the bar area nor is there one in the market. If you need to use the facilities then you have to completely walk out of the market and what's left of the old food court down a long hall and you will find them. Expect to pay prices similar to the old Easy Street here but the nice thing is you don't have to tip here. My pho bowl came to $9.50 plus tax. Prices seem reasonable but I feel this place is going to be experimental. Once I get an opportunity to try some of the other concepts then I'll be able to advise my own recommendations. My meal was average to say the least and afterwards I was unable to locate my cook to let him know that noodles weren't to my liking."}
