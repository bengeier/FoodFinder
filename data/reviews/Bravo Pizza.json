{"text":"The pizza is very good, and they have some great combo deals on pizza and a drink. Good place to walk in and order a slice, if you can put up with the weirdo that owns the place."}
{"text":"Eh. Walking in it's your typical quaint local pizza store, which tries to sell all sorts of random things. Cleanliness was a bit dubious. Pizza was ok, but there's better in the area."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here, it's nothing amazing, but it's cheap, thin crust, and you also have a huge selection of drinks to choose from. Usually I'd get 2 slices to satisfy my craving, because the slices aren't too big.   3.5 star if I could, but I'll give it a 4 on here"}
{"text":"My girlfriend thinks this place is a money laundering front for the mafia. The place is dirty. The pizza is ridiculously overpriced ($25 for a small pizza) and doesn't taste that good. They sell cigar paraphernalia in a display case. I agree. The place does seem suspicious. Especially when you consider you rarely ever see anyone in there, which makes you wonder how they are paying the bills. There is another pizza place just north on Sutherland that is waaaay better."}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive, thin crust pizza.  Love coming in here for a slice, getting teased by the owner and listening to his eclectic music tastes.  Great neighbourhood spot for a late night slice."}
