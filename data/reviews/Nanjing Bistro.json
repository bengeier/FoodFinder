{"text":"Nice Lunch spot!  Ask the person what she recommends and don't be afraid to ask what everything is.  I've gotten the $10 lunch special before and the quality of the food is pretty high.  The inside is kind of tight for my taste but alright.  The food and location is the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"Food tastes like ass and is overpriced, really don't understand why people come here when there are infinitely better options such as Empire, Evo Cafe, House of Gourmet, even Panda express, etc."}
{"text":"Average food and sub-par service. No one brought me a napkin and only once did someone check on me during my meal. It was a man who spoke no English and he brought me a spoon. I already had a spoon. I wanted a napkin."}
