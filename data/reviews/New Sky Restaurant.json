{"text":"I don't remember exactly what we had, but spicy soup was awful, seemed as they dumbed as much red pepper and fat as they could come up with. The worst soup ever! I had pork in bean sause, mostly bones, pork bones and bean sause, and still it tasted fat. On brighter note chicken for appetizer was ok, but the rest of the meal not"}
{"text":"Ok so their service is always a hit or a miss but I must say I am a native Torontonian and this is by far the best Chinese in the city! 

Now, every time I come back to the city, this place is on my list of restaurants to eat at. 

Pepper steak, beef short ribs, beef and chicken lo mein are all fantastic. As far as the appetizers go, their hot and sour soup, egg drop soup and deep fried shrimp balls are great as well.  Be patient with the wait staff because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"New Sky is one of my best kept secrets about Chinatown.  Some people may not see its worth, but that's probably b/c they just don't know how to order.  Expect the menus to be in full mandarin, and no help available if you're english-only.  But luckily, the best items aren't even on the menu.  As you eat lunch you can watch the fresh ingredients brought in from the market, then straight to your plate.  The dinner for two deal is usually the best option, and you'll love the soups... try the sweet and sour and corn, they're both great.  Don't be afraid to order duck or lobster the way you like it, or ask questions about spiciness levels.  This is a true Chinese restaurant if you're looking for authenticity.  Recommended:  Duck, lobster, lemon chicken, any fish (de-boned!)"}
{"text":"My go to late night spot for chinese food in the city. If youre not in the city head to markham/Richmond hill.  Everytime i try a new dish im hella impressed. Prices are reasonable and portions are meant to share (even a single soup  )"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service can be lacking.  There used to be a great waitress there named Peggy but she doesn't work there anymore.  We have been going for years and have noticed recently that the portions of the food have substantially gone down.  

Would have given 5 stars if the service wasn't so hit and miss.  If you want authentic chinese food this is the place to go.  I highly recommend the Bird's nest with Seafood (the nest is comprised of shredded taro fried in a basket with vegetables, scallops, shrimp and squid)."}
{"text":"I'm a little conflicted by this restaurant and not too sure what to rate it. This place is more pricey than your average Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, but the quality of the food has always been superb and my family and I used to come here as a treat. At that time I would rate it 5/5, no questions asked.

But ever since the owner changed for the restaurant, we've returned twice, and we decided we will no longer go back. The quality of the food decreased dramatically. The oil they use for the food is old, not filtered and it just tastes horrible. Maybe one day, we'll perk up the courage to try it again, but if it falls short of expectations, then that's just too bad. As it stands now, I would give this 2/5 stars, but didn't want to give a horrible rating since this was once my fave restaurant."}
{"text":"As a Peruvian I was happy to finally find a Chifa in Toronto that lived up to childhood memories. Chifa is Chinese food adapted to Peruvian ingredients and palates. Chifa in Peru is fresh and full of flavours, onions, garlic and much more, perfectly embodied in the chancho with ajo dish found in New Sky's Chifa menu.

We enjoyed classic Cantonese lobster and ginger, the lobster flesh was sweet which complimented a great tangy ginger flavour. Crunchy, sweet snow pea leaves were expertly cooked, a perfect accompaniment to the salty, briny and well spiced clams in black bean sauce.

I'm looking forward to my next meal."}
{"text":"Foods taste bad , service are 
Horrible , over charged . Never coming back here again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Really good food. I recommend the general Tao and deep fried beancurd. Just look at what other people order"}
{"text":"Good Canadian Chinese food!! I hear it has great authentic Chinese food as well! Very reasonably priced and excellent food!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my boyfriend's family and every time I love the food.

Aside from growing up in a vietnamese household, I also grew up in a chinese one as well. So when I know good chinese food, i know it.

This place gets very busy during dinner time and every time i come here, everyone orders their fresh lobster and seafood. At the end they even give you complementary oranges and sometimes free dessert. (but maybe cause the bill is always around $150. Either way i'm not complaining) 

This place is so good that i'd take my parents there but my mom is a vegetarian. 

The manager is very friendly and the service is quite good for a chinese restaurant! 

Food 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Always have a meal here when we're in Toronto. Crab steamed rice and king mushrooms are a couple of favourites."}
{"text":"They forgot to take out a THUMB SIZE RUBBER BAND (the one that's on lobster claw) in the lobster dish, discovered while chewing the meat and tasted bitter. Restaurant staff was unapologetic and only willing to gave a 10% discount whereas the standard compensation should be 50% to 100% of the meal cost. They also stated that the discount would only be given if paid in cash, which we suspected they had a cash discount policy anyways. When confronted, the restaurant staff said we agreed to the 10% discount even though they didn't explicitly state it (they claimed they did but obviously doesn't make sense since we would've not have agreed to it). They also said if we didn't want it we shouldn't have eaten the rest of it, but they never even offered to redo the food, and we were in a hurry to get to the next sightseeing attraction (think what you would do in this position). All in all, it's clear this restaurant cares more about its bottom line than customer satisfaction or general health, especially if you are a tourist. I would advise future patrons to carefully inspect their food before consuming and note the specific amount to be refunded if the staff ever offers to discount for something that went wrong."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ Pork Fried Rice (????) for $9.50 before tax, came with free soup (wintergourd pork ribs soup) and free taro dessert! Good service, extremely satiated!"}
{"text":"Two Friends and I hit New Sky for some real deal Chinese food on Friday eve.  This is my Cantonese girl friend's goto so we new it would be good. We ordered three dishes to share. Fried White Fish with Crab Sauce, Chiese Tofu & Seafood Hot Pot and an Eggplant and Enoki Mushroom dish.  All three were good.

If you are used to eating Chinese Food in Markham, you will likely be disappointed my most of the Spadina Strip restaurants. New Sky is definitely one of the best in the bunch.  I've been several times and its always been a good experience. There is usually a lineup around dinner hours.

Mostly Cantonese Fare, and a good number of dishes offered in Chinese only without an English Translation. You really want to bring a Chinese speaker with you when you visit.  (Thank You Patty H!)  

Heavy on the MSG though, was unbelievably thirsty for the rest of the evening.  Brought some Chow Mein home for the SO which was really pricy at $12.40. 

Minus half a Star for the price. $44 for 3 dishes some tea and some rice?  $12.40 for Chow Mein? ouch.  Minus half a star for the MSG. Tonnes."}
{"text":"Good hot food. Arrives fast. Tastes great. Been here many times. Some of the dishes are a little too sweet but how could that be bad? Always leave feeling completely stuffed and enough food for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Was here one Saturday evening. The quality of the food is excellent and will not disappoint. We order Sweet and Sour Chicken with Pineapple, which is tender with a light coating on the chicken. Cantonese Chow Mien, Beef with Broccoli, and Shrimp Scallops with Snow Peas.  All dishes we tasty and satisfying  However, the quality of service needs to be improved. 

For example, one of the servers delivered a dish to our table that belonged to another. I talked to our waiter and said that we did not order the dish. His immediate reaction was \"Yes you did!\" in an accusatory tone of voice. I responded by asking him to tell me what dish it was. He then picked up the dish and delivered it to the correct table. Not even an apology for his arrogance in assuming the customer is wrong.

However, some of the other wait staff was friendly. I would give a 4 star, but the quality and consistency of service deserves the docking of 1 star."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in  many years, but we had a craving for snails and clams, so automatically thought Chinatown as nothing beats seafood cooked in black bean sauce.  Our go-to place in the past has always been Sang's Great Seafood Restaurant, but remembered our last time there it wasn't that great, so came to New Sky since it was just up the street from Sang's.

Since it was late around 11ish on a Thursday night, the place wasn't busy with only three tables occupied.  Therefore, we got friendly, fast and efficient service like most of the Chinese restaurants in the area.  Perhaps it helped that we spoke Cantonese as we always seem to get somewhat better service if we spoke Cantonese.  I guess it helps some of the staff since their English can be very limited at times, but the server we had spoke English very well.   He even was going back and forth speaking both Cantonese and English with us, even though we spoke Cantonese to him the whole time, but we were speaking English among ourselves.

Server informed us they're open until 5am on Friday and Saturday night. Perhaps he assumed that both my friend and I were in our 20s. I have long passed my days when I was out until that early in the morning, but it was nice to know should I ever need a seafood fix at that time if I'm still awake, then I can come here.

We ordered the sweet yam leaves which was cooked in a shrimp paste with lots of garlic.  It was very tasty and the leaves were quite tender.  I'm guessing not many people know about the sweet yam leaves as they'll probably opt for the sweat pea shoots, but try it next time if it's available in the Chinese restaurant you dine in.

The snails and clams we ordered were cooked in a black bean sauce.  The first few we had tasted good as it has been a long time since we had them, so the taste of nostalgia returned to us momentarily.  That didn't last too long since we found the dishes to be too salty.  Thankfully, we ordered a bowl of rice to share to absorb some of the saucy goodness.

We also found the prices a bit higher than what we normally would pay, since usually three dishes would cost under $30, but for it to cost close to $40, we were a little surprised.  Perhaps it was market prices for the items we ordered, we don't know as we just ordered without looking at the menu since we knew what we wanted when we arrived and just placed the order with the server.

I guess next time we should look at the menu or ask for pricing to avoid any surprises, but when one needs to satisfy a craving, we simply do not care too much about prices as long as it tastes good.

Perhaps we should learn to read Chinese because there's a special menu listed on the wall only in Chinese characters."}
{"text":"The server there is so rude. Once my friends and I went there for dinner. We sat there an hour waiting while all the server can gave us is we are really busy at the time. A group came in after us had dishes served.  And the server were basically yelling at us for asking why the food took so long. Nothing was served when we left."}
{"text":"Service was very slow, but the dim sum was good. The Sui Mai was excellent, both the shrimp as well as the pork. The haw gau was just ok. The shell was thick and very doughy. The gai lan was nice and crisp. 
All together a nice lunch."}
{"text":"The Field's Institute is at the corner of College and Spadina.  If you're there for a week or two of workshops, that means you're going to be looking for lunch and dinner places that are: close; reasonably priced; and good for groups.

New Sky fits the bill, so I've been there several times.  The food is pretty good, though there are other places in Toronto's Chinatown that are better, but less conveniently located.  Three stars seems about right, but I somehow suspect I'll wander in again the next time I find myself at UT for some reason or other."}
{"text":"I used to live just around the block from New Sky, and it was by far my favourite late night Chinese spot on Spadina Ave. I like how versatile this place is. You can go for a sit down meal at three in the morning, or swing by for a quick pick-up (as in, call and it's ready in fifteen minutes) in the middle of the day. That speaks to me. 

Always check out the whiteboard of specials, where you'll find a frequently changing list of tasty surprises like deep-fried softshell crab. On the menu otherwise, it's always fun to get a sizzling plate and truthfully, I just can't stay away from the lemon chicken. The batter is thick and the chicken is searing hot, beside a bright yellow goo of lemon sauce. I order the dish knowing that it's not traditional, but the taste is too good to pass up. Also, I end up slopping the sauce on many other items.

Service is as quick as possible, sometimes in as few words as possible. The plastic table cloths mean that people are in and out of there in no time. But when it comes to the crowds that the wee hours bring out, the staff really do have the patience of saints. Free tea is always a nice touch, and I appreciate that we have this beacon of hope during hours many other restaurants are closed. 

For late night Chinese, this place is A-OK in my books."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a very late night Chinese food craving! We were walking around and starving and it seemed like nothing was still open. Except: New Sky Restaurant. 

Don't feel intimidated by their neon light sign saying they're open when it's passed midnight! 

In the heart of China Town, this little place serves generous portions of typical Chinese food such as fried rice chicken, dumplings and soy sauce sautés. We even had leftovers for our lunches! 

The service was good and we had absolutely no language barrier by pointing the elements of the menu that we wanted them to serve us! No problem!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the service. When there's a lineup, you can wait at the door forever, no one will come out. They'll just seat the budders who push their way in. They don't even try to hide that Chinese guests are getting preferential treatment. Often you'll have to ask 3 times and you'll basically be finished your meal before you get your rice. And some of the wait staff act like they're doing you a huge favour. But the food is really good, as evidenced by how consistently busy it is. The General Tao chicken is unlike any other, and that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I would give a zero if I could.. The food like absolute shit. Flavourless and greasy (I don't even get how that's possible). Staple dishes such as century egg and pork congee and the shanghai fried noodles should be hard to fuck up. Nope, managed to make it taste horrible as well.."}
{"text":"Really dissapointed today. Came here with family and it was packed as usual. Wait wasn't too long but was cramped near high traffic hallway where they serve food and little seats without back supports. 

The free soup was very bland... supposedly boiled with corn and meat. There were corn cobs present but a weird super small piece of shred pork. We ordered fried oyster and it was $18 for 8 small, non crispy on the verge of soft, battered oysters. Flavorless or over killed saltiness when you use some of the salt that it comes with. The varied spice fried pork chop was very salty as well and on the verge of burnt as one can tell from the colour. The \"ong\" choy had a pretty decent cook but they missed that we ordered it with beef and not plain. We had a fresh fish that was braised in a thick sauce with mushrooms and veggies. Not bad...broth was savory and rich, but fish seemed small for almost $40. Didn't try their dessert soup since it had PEANUTS in it. :'(

Used to be better before in my memory or maybe because today was too busy."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since I've been here...the last time I thought the food was absolutely delicious. Today was a totally different experience...was there early so a busy resto was not the issue. The service was curt at best...hot & sour soup was unbalanced...more sour than hot. The crispy ginger beef was drowning in sauce and lacking in ginger...the fried chicken was bony and over-cooked. They neglected to order one of our dishes so we were just as happy to cancel it. Sadly I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service and food. Went for Sunday lunch. I believe they were so understaffed on the dining floor and kitchen because I had to wait 1 hour for my first dish.

Beef Chow Fun [2 of 5] Ho Fun was kind of old. And the beef was dry.

Tripe with preserved vegetables [2 of 5] Tripe had smell to it. Not fresh or not washed cleanly.

Taro stuffed on duck [3 of 5] Looked ok, however, I am not sure if the chef are suppose to leave the duck skin on and fry it. When it came out, the skin was the blackest part of the taro duck. It was a big grosh. I wish they removed it the skin and did not fry it. I don't think it is not a good idea to fry the fat duck skin.

NOTE: Accepts all credit cards."}

{"text":"We had our family's Chinese New Year dinner here tonight. We booked ahead for 5:30PM. Good choice of timing. We had a table for 8 ready for us. The New Year set menu was outstanding included shark fin soup, lobster, roasted chicken, roasted duck, Peking duck, tofu, vegetable, mshroom, steam fish, so much to eat. My daughters said this is much better than the restaurant in Markham and Richmobd Hill that we are last week. They gave us red bean soup at the end. Good food, good service, outstanding and courteous servers always to please the patrons. We will be back again. Tan family. 2/21/2015 ????????????"}
{"text":"This is possibly one of the greatest Chinese restaurants I've ever dined at in Toronto Chinatown. This place specializes in seafood, so definitely try the lobster. This establishment is on the loud end, and don't be surprised when you see people waiting outside on a busy day: it is a pretty compact space. Staff were very friendly. If you are in Toronto Chinatown, definitely stop by this place.

Sidenote: There is essentially a \"secret\" menu with a greater variety of combo options. It isn't given out with the other menus, and you have to ask for it or take it from the shelf by the stairwell to the washroom. The menu is written entirely in Traditional Chinese, so if you can't read it, tough luck."}

{"text":"How many times have I been here?
Maybe once or twice a year.  Maybe 10-15 times since 2009.  I always come here with Thai people, my family, friends and coworkers.  It seems like a food spot for Thai people.
 
FOOD (3 stars)
They have many kinds of seafood such as lobster, crab, fish, clam, oyster, and scallop.  I try to avoid having Chinese food because I usually eat Thai food 4-5 days a week already.  Their food is quite similar, and many dishes are oily.  However, many dishes are difficult to deny.  
We often order the same dishes almost every time.  They were Live Lobsters in different kind of sauces, Fried rice with Crabs, Cold Chicken with Jelly Fish, Steamed Live Seabass, Snow Pea Leaves with King Mushrooms, etc.  However, we also tried new items this time too.  We had razor clams in Black Bean Sauce, Stuff Crab Claw and Sautéed Jumbo Shrimp with Szechuan Sauce.  My today favorite was Cold Chicken!  
 
AMBIANCE (3 stars)
They have many round tables. Each table is good for ten people.  The restaurant could seat at least 100 people in their dining room.  The best thing is they close very late on Sunday to Thursday at 2 am. and open until 5 am in the morning on Friday and Saturday.  That is kind of cool for a night owl~
 
SERVICE (3.5 stars)
It is hard to expect excellent service in China town. However, they were friendly and attentive.

{"text":"Our go-to Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. This restaurant has been around for a long time and serves good traditional Chinese (Cantonese style) food. The service is meh and the decor is dated but we keep coming back! 

For their delicious steamed crab rice wrapped in lotus leaf. Their stir fried green beans with pork was also pretty good. Meals always comes with house soup of random pork or chicken bones with carrots beans or random vegetables. I also recommend their sesame beef and seasonal fresh seafood.

Don't expect great service they usually just want to get you in and out as fast as they can!"}
{"text":"Chef's Special Chili Chicken on a hot plate...yummmm...the chicken is grilled and sufficiently hot and comes with crunchy fried noodles that add texture!"}

Needed Chinese take out on New Year's Eve and didn't know where to go. I took the first parking space i could find on Spadina and walked till i found a really busy restaurant, pledging to order take out from there.
Plan worked perfectly.
Took a couple of blocks to find a really busy place and saw New Sky.  It was packed to over-flowing. And with cause.
Ordered three dishes:Scallops with vegetables: Scallops cooked perfectly (at a time when the kitchen must have been insanely busy),  Beef and broccoli. Beef tender and tasty.  And seafood rice. Yum.
Will definitely be back because it is a really great Chinese restaurant.
However, quiet it is not.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, this one stands out with the quality of the food and price that comes with the food.
$8.5 would get you a very generous portion of sliced beef in schezwan sauce or schezwan noodles with beef or sliced beef in amazing black bean sauce.
very tasty, very fresh also.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Preeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeety good. I've been here twice now, and both times the food has been pretty good. The first time, I came with my partner and we got the lemon chicken and crispy sesame beef. Both were pretty tasty, but I was more a fan of the beef. I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size, and we had food leftover to take home. (Oh, but remember to order rice in addition)

The second time I came it was with a party of 7. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit. The scalop congee I heard was really good, as was the veg. fried rice. The one thing that people seemed not to like very much was the chicken balls. I tried a couple, and would say that personally they were okay. It was unusual, because I didnt find them bad, I just found them to be different than the chicken balls one would recieve at most places. These were harder crusted, and almost seemed like corn-meal coated. They weren't bad, but they were a bit mealy/doughy.. and just different. This was the one thing the table seemed to not be a huge fan of for the most part. Everything else everyone loved.

Our server was very polite. A young girl. The service was a bit slow (we asked for water twice since I think the server forgot the first time), but it was also very busy, so it is understandable. 

Overall, pretty good food for a decent price and good portion. This is quickly becoming a China Town regular for me. :D"}
{"text":"Reliable quality, great service, awesome food."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible wait times. Waited for 10mins to sit and waited for more than 30 mins to eat. Not a good stop for Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"This place has the best Cantonese style Chinese food on the Spadina strip. Although Toronto prides itself on its diversity in ethnic food, most people know the good Chinese food is in Markham / Scarborough. And while that is true, New Sky will have you returning back. 

Having been here by recommendation, I have since been a returning customer. It saves me a trip to the suburbs when I crave the food of my people.

Beware though, they have a secret (better) menu in Chinese that I'm assuming would only be given to you if you appear to be Chinese. And although I am Cantonese, both times the Chinese menu was only offered to me once I've asked. 

Recommend dishes: Fried snow pea leaf, sizzling satay beef, fish and tofu clay pot, scallion and ginger stir fried lobster.

OH: also, BONUS! The servers here are very friendly. They all speak decent English and are relatively attentive."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times over the years and given my experience today I am a little confused. 

While it has always been a place where you could find decent value, my parents have enjoyed it and there are often many people eating at the restaurant, I have never really liked the food that much. The taste of some dishes was poor and the chicken could have been of better quality. 

Today I went with my father yet again, but this time for a late lunch on a Thursday. The place was empty and I was wondering about the quality of the chef they might have on hand in the middle of the day. To my surprise, the food was quite good; much better than what I have had in the past. 

The wonton soup was tasty as was the beef with black bean sauce. The stir fried chicken with vegetables was well made. The chicken was a decent quality and the broccoli, snow peas, etc. were cooked to perfection.

I am really not sure what to say. I don't know if they have a new chef in place or if they can cook better food when they are not so busy. 

Normally I would give this place two stars, but today I would have given it four.

We will have to keep trying to see how it delivers in the future.

November 4, 2014

So, I returned to New Sky for lunch and it came through a second time. The Chinese vegetables with walnuts were crispy and the beef with onion and ginger was tasty. I do need to try this place at dinner, but this could become a new go to place."}
{"text":"In terms of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, this is one of the last decent authentic places. The best thing about this place is the price point. You'd be surprised how little you'll pay to get for so much."}
{"text":"Well, It has been a long time since I have been to New Sky Restaurant and I went here on recommendation for a Mother's Day lunch and I was not disappointed. This is the some of the best Cantonese food that Toronto has to offer. This place has gained a lot of recognition over the years for the amazing food that is served. I received very nice service from the waiters and they actually speak decent English, which is a huge bonus. There is also a special menu with combinations of their most famous Chinese dishes, but unfortunately, the special is written in Chinese.  Although we did wait a little bit longer than expected for our dishes, I was in complete heaven when I took a bite into the Garoupa with Tofu in Hot Pot, I was speechless. The chicken was moist and juicy and there was a lot of chicken available for everyone to share. I must warn you though, dinner does get chaotic due to the restaurant's reputation,so be sure to reserve a table in advance to have an amazing journey of authentic Cantonese cuisine."}
{"text":"In my 5 day trip to Toronto, we came to New Sky for dinner TWO TIMES! Unheard of in my book!

However, this is my granduncle's go-to spot for large family-style dinners, and what he says-- goes. No complaints though, because my family knows how to eat! (I have them to thank for that!)

Standouts were: Black Bean Oysters, Fish Maw Soup, Vancouver Crab, Free Range Chicken with Jellyfish, Peking Porkchops, Whole Steamed Fish, Ginger & Scallion Stir-Fried Lobster, and Papaya Snow Fungus Dessert Soup. Really, everything here is traditional Cantonese style and very good.

*Note: I just googled all these dishes to learn the English names because I saw a lot of White people eating there on both days too. I also see a bunch of reviewers telling others to \"bring a Cantonese friend.\" You're welcome!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese Fried Rice so we stopped in to New Sky at ~3pm on a Saturday afternoon.  The Chicken Fried Rice was OK (bit bland), the Sizzling Chili Chicken Hot Plate good (interesting crispy chip-like noodles as a base)  and the Calamari was excellent (very tasty). Service was above average.  Wait for food was slightly longer than normal but it was a lazy afternoon for all. I'm still searching for a good Chinese Fried Rice but hear that Swatow Restaurant should be my next stop."}
{"text":"My wife went here recently with her colleagues and raved about the grouper and tofu hotpot so we bundled the kids and visited on a Wednesday night dinner.

We're here for the food so decor and service aren't really that important. The latter two items I'd say were satisfactory. The place was only half full so we got seated and served quickly. 

What did we order? That aforementioned hotpot, clams in black bean sauce, a plate of chinese veg (you choy) and sweet and sour pork for the kids. 4 bowls of rice added and we were ready.

The hotpot was very good. The fish pieces and tofu were freshly deep fried and then placed on a bed of watercress before being reheated. The sauce was exceptional--I tasted  oyster sauce, orange peel and shrimp paste. We'd definitely re-order.

The other dishes were fine--hot from the wok and simply made.

We'll be back to try more seafood. It's our alternative to New Ho King across the street."}
{"text":"Great peruvian-chinese place! On top of the abundantly common menus in the area, this place gets the extra edge by having a \"secret\" menu of Peruvian-style Cantonese a.k.a. \"CHIFA\"
The \"chancho al ajo\" was very very good!
Also the traditional fried wantan, \"chicharron de pollo\" and the \"Chi-jau-Kai\" were like the typical CHIFA de Lima."}

Crispy beef and Sizzling chilli chicken (aka confetti chicken) are favourites.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I ventured down to China Town late Friday night hoping to find some life in it. We were sad to find that around 10PM China Town had started to shut down. We hadn't eaten yet, so walked until we found something that looked fitting.

New Sky was a good choice. The food there was great, as well as the service. Our waiter was very nice, and funny. When I ordered the same dish as my boy friend he encouraged us to try something new. I told him to bring out a \"surprise\" pork dish.

Good thing he did, it was delicious. I didn't notice the noise level, but my boyfriend thought it was loud. It was a wee bit slow, but the atmosphere encouraged conversation; the time passed quickly.

I'm glad I got the chance to eat at New Sky."}
{"text":"Ordered some dishes and after trying to enjoy my food for 5 minutes a cockroach started running on the corner of one of the dishes that I ordered (now I am not sure whether the cockroach was already on the plate of the dish or hiding somewhere on the table but it is still gross). I chased it away and tried to eat again but lost appetite.  So, I packed everything (gave all the food to a homeless guy with full disclosure), and paid the bill (I really should not have and should have taken a picture instead)...but brain was not function properly."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. This place is an absolute dump. It's a hole in the wall without the good food - it's literally just a wall hole.

For whatever reason, this place is SUPER busy - the owners/servers don't even appreciate the business and are complete jerks - minus one or two sweet lady servers. 

They cut corners where they can - e.g. they don't clean/de-vein their shrimp. Hmm, I wonder where else they cut corners. Forget about any type of basic service - we're not asking for smiles or anything extraordinary. e.g. We ate in a table filled with our empty dirty dishes and to top it off, next to our faces are the butts of guests that are waiting to be seated and unappreciated (there is no waiting area). The food is disgustingly greasy and while I can see some real flavour potential, it didn't really quite make it.

Never. Ever. Again. Would love to scare them with a slow week or two so that they can pick up their game."}
{"text":"Home to my first meal in Canada, ever! Made it somewhat of a tradition to swing by here first thing with every trip I've taken.

Nothing special or out of the ordinary, just your average, late-night Chinese fix. The best things in life are cheap, and preferably open until 5am

Start with the Chinese broccoli to show the locals how healthy you are, then proceed to scarf down their lobster special in no time flat. Take note of the hefty size, sharing is most definitely encouraged."}
{"text":"This place is old skool like the places your parents took you when you were eleven years old. You'd sit at the kids table and avoid eating any vegetables that weren't put on your plate by an adult. 

Anways, the food is not bad, the set dinner menu has the best value and you can certainly be nostalgic for past times. The decor and seating is cramped but it is filled with Chinese people so that's not a bad sign."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Best Chinese restaurant in Downtown.  Always see non-Asian customers complain about the service, but it's a Chinese place no one cares the service.  I always get the \"Koh-Loh\", pork belly stewed in some kind of black sauce.  Deep-fried Garoupa also yummy."}
{"text":"Probably the best general Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (non-general Chinese restaurants being hotpot, spicy restaurants, etc.)

The set menu is amazing, the hot and sour soup is awesome (I might order a large one to go), and the service is OMG good. The last time I came here (last weekend), the server refilled my teacups when passing by! Also super friendly!"}
{"text":"The crab rice we ordered was absolutely the bomb. Perfectly cooked steam rice mixed with crab meet and paste. Absolutely amazing. The seasoning of the ginger & scallion lobster and black bean clams was also spot-on. An unassuming Chinatown joint with the kind of homey ambiance and friendly staff of a neighbourhood restuarant. The price also offers great value. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for some authentic Cantonese style seafood dishes in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on a Niagara+Toronto vacation half a year ago (so yeah, if the experience stuck around with for that long, that should tell you something). Food was okay, which is the only reason this place is two stars instead of one. Perhaps the reason it did not astound me was because we did not order any of the seafood (\"market price\" tends to scare us away from ordering). But really, the reason for the low score is my GOD the service was terrible.

To put this in perspective, I think people that complain about service at Chinese restaurants are idiots who don't understand how stuff works there. Seriously, they're servers, their job is to bring you your food and keep your drinks topped off and get paid a salary plus tips (mostly tips) to do it quickly and attentively. Nowhere in that job description is \"make small talk about the weather and how your kids are doing and whatnot\". Seriously, how needy do you have to be to judge a restaurant based on that kind of stuff? So when I tell you that the service here was terrible, that should be telling you something.

Specifically: we were seated promptly, but it literally took an hour to get a congee out, and the excuse was that \"that's just the order in the queue\" and another party that came in after us got all their food first, and that this was literally the first time in many years of dining out where I actually used the power of the tip to denote horrible service.

As far as the racism allegations, my family is all completely Chinese and we still got this kind of treatment. I think what's probably the case is that they probably cater to the critics first and foremost, knowing that those people will give them high rankings and reviews, and then they figure they can just coast along because there will be no shortage of people (like my family) who will go there based on that."}
{"text":"The layout of the dining room here is really weird. Not only is it cramped, a strategy employed to maximize seating and thus the takings, when you step through the door, you feel as if you're confronted by a phalanx of tables. Somehow, you'll just have to bust your way through.

I recall liking this restaurant a couple years ago, when the food was comparable in quality to others on the same strip, like E-Pan or Lee Garden. This was not the case tonight. 

While the complimentary soup of the day was fine, the steamed chicken (guifeiji) was merely edible. One of my dinner companions actually exclaimed, only half-jokingly, \"What IS that?\" right in front of the server. While I suppose the taste was acceptable when you slather ginger-scallion sauce liberally onto your piece of chicken, it looked like it was just dunked in boiling water too cook, and the texture reflected as much.

The sauteed bean shoot leaves with enoki (yaozhu jin'gu pa doumiao) was a platter of okay-tasting leaves, but capped by a layer of thick cornstarch slurry. Any thicker and it would have been cornstarch jello.

We also ordered steamed sea scallops (suanrong zheng daizi) as they were on special. They were indeed very fresh, but way over cooked, to the point of being a little chewy. What a waste of good seafood.

The steamed fish was probably the best dish of the night, though it too, was overdone.

Overall, it was very disappointing. I was so looking forward to Chinese food. At least the washrooms were clean. We all know that the most important part of a review of a Chinatown restaurant, is the washroom. Oh, and it was cheap. And the service was decent.

I will probably not come again, at least for a long time. There are other, better restaurants on that strip.

[Seems like Yelp strips out the Unicode Chinese characters. Don't they want to expand to China???!!!]"}
{"text":"I've been living in Toronto for 9 months and this is the best Chinese food I've ever had. The dishes' flavors are all so good because the owner lived in Peru and he enriches his cuisine with the Chinese Cantonese Peruvian fusion. If u are in Lima you must visit Madame Tusane ( inc Japanese fusion) and u ll know what I m talking about ;)"}
{"text":"Been coming here and noticed at least the last half year things are different.

We used to get the deep fried taro and shredded duck.  It used to be nice and flaky, but the last few times it looks like a plop.

One time we went recently and it was an hour before dishes came out.  One large group was tired of waiting they were leaving and thats when food came out.

Turns out the management changed.  Suddenly it made sense.  

Its owned by one of the former waiters.  He'd been there for years and was always lazy.  Now hes the owner.  

There used to be a hard working manager there who pulled everyone's weight but he left.

I think some kitchen staff quit, hence the duck has been a shell of its former glory."}
{"text":"Food was excellent portions were large. Service was extremely slow. Be careful when using a US credit card. The banking system in Canada may be different than in the United States. The credit card keep asking for a PIN number and we did not have one when we swiped the credit card instead of using the chip reader it went through just fine"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here once every couple weeks.  We love this place.  They are very reasonably priced and have good service.  Although most of the servers dont speak too much english they are polite and know enough to have a conversation.  The food is incredible and it's always busy.  They so have a small dining room but we have always gotten a seat even if they have to make you a table at the back.  We will continue to come back here for many years to come."}
{"text":"I don't know about the Peruvian menu items, but the Chinese menu items are delicious and reasonably priced, the ladies here always have a smile on there faces and treat you well."}
{"text":"Delicious seafood fried noodles ! I tried the razor clams they were a bit spicy and good. I love how they give you free soup and dessert soup as well. Service is good. They come when you wave. Definitely decently priced for good food. It would be nice if they gave us a bigger table so I can have a chair to put my bags on ...since there was only one other party there since it was late ..like 9 pm."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this restaurant for several years and I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet! Service is polite and quick and the food is always great. Our go-to menu: lobster with green onion and ginger, spicy fried squid, and seafood Cantonese chow mein. Perfect for dinner or a late night meal. Paul is usually our server and he rocks!"}
{"text":"My family have been coming here for years and every time I visit, my parents still take me there once. 

The place is a bit crammed, service can be a bit slow but the servers has never oversold us food. This one lady who has worked there for years would always tell us that a soup and 3 dishes are more than enough for our family of 3 but we are always happy to take some home.

I have had so many things there that I can't name them all, but most of them are very decent Cantonese style dishes. Basically I don't remember anything being bad.

The duck with taro is definitely my favourite here. The fatty duck coated by mashed taro, crispily fried has the prefect texture and taste!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place every once in a while after night outs with friends. The food is not bad given the options after midnight. However, the service last night was awful! The waiter was literally making fun of (and laughing at) one of the guests in our party because she asked if she could order chow mein noodle on the side.
When it came to paying, I used my Amex in the machine, and I was halfway through putting in my pin when he pulled the machine out of my hand, and pulled the card out when the message says \"do not remove card\". He then almost yelled at me and said they don't take Amex. I tried to explain that their machine was actually working, but he was so rude that I gave up.

Avoid this place if you care about customer service."}
{"text":"We came at a busy time apparently..all tables were full at 8pm on a Friday night. Stumbled into this place mistaking it for another one I couldn't remember the name of that was awesome last time we were here. Anyhow, we got in and shortly after were seated. It took them quite a while to come back to our table after that to get 
us some water and take our orders. Luckily the kids food came out rather quickly but, I have to say, our food came out staggered and took quite some time to arrive. My daughter had egg drop soup which was a bit more watery than any I've had but, maybe more 'authentic'? Then, the kids shared some chicken ball(s) which were actually pretty awesome. The batter on them reminded me of corn dog batter, or maybe even like hush puppies, slightly sweet and moist breading...they were actually quite good. We had the fried tofu which looked like small round fried discs but, the tofu was very creamy and almost looked like custard..I thought it was quite good and my girlfriend loved it (we were starving by then). We also had a steamed shrimp dumpling app that was o-k compared to others I have had. When our main course came out maybe an hour or so later..we had the seafood hotpot with bean curd...it was awesome!! The seafood was a great mix of shrimp, octopus (calamari), fish, bok choy, mushrooms all mixed with a light sauce that was spectacular. Great meal that didn't sit heavy in your stomach and was just enough for two people. 

Anyhow, I would give the food 4 stars and the service 3."}
{"text":"Good and cheap seafood. It's a little bit crowded here and the waiters are always busy. If you don't like to be surrounded by people or wait,then just find another restaurant. If you choose to come,don't complain so much."}
{"text":"I went there with Jennifer M. and another friend of mine. It is usual Cantonese meal except the seating area was poorly designed. 

It seems like they try to pack as many people they can in to the place and we were literally only 2 inch away from our table next to us. 

The server also kept missing us, as we were tucked in the corner and I have to go the counter to pick up our menu because we can't seem to grab the server to serve us. 

(read Jennifer M's comment about the food we ordered, so I am not gonna repeat here again)

I agree that the price isn't the best compare to other Chinese restaurants but it is A-OK. 

They have other menu on the chalkboard but it's all in Chinese. We didnt end up ordering from there as most of the dish are quite expensive. ($13 to $28)

And literally don't be afraid to raise your hands or stand up to call the server because if you don't put your out there, the server will ignore you and of course, I wouldn't put more than 10% of tips because the service wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"They use to be good, but today it's just horrible the ginger orange beef is just way too salty and it has no orange flavor just a mouth full of soy sauce beef. The salted chicken fried rice is soggy, which is not suppose to be for a fried rice they messed up on the most basic fried rice that is why I am giving 1 star."}
{"text":"I'm from Windsor and I believe they have the best Chinese food in North America. New Sky tho is up there. Best in Toronto by far. The quality of the food is great. It's a little pricey, but its worth it. Love the cantonese noodles, won ton, and spicy seafood. I'd move back to Toronto just for this restaurant!!! 

3 1/2 STARS for the restaurant: nothing fancy

5 STARS for the food: absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed no double lobster deal.  It was a whopping $27/lb so we went with live steamed tilapia which was quite good.  Bird's nest seafood was pretty good.  Scallop seafood soup was low on other seafood but tasted very good.  Shrimp scallops and snow peas was disappointing... Very small amount of snow peas and a ton of celery!  WTH!! Chinese broccoli was not good quality...pale stems and bitter.  Fried rice was very good.  A mixed bag overall.  I thought it was a bit of a scam but my non-chinese wife that it was very good."}
{"text":"Food took over an hour, service was beyond terrible, the waitress was impolite and got orders wrong besides forgetting to ask for our food. Food was average at best, but definitely not worth the bad experience."}
{"text":"The Food is always great at New Sky. Wait staff are fast and attentive - Paul is the man, seems like he has been my server every time for years. Love the chowmein noodles, they are always the right amount of crispy. The spicy crispy chicken was good tonight, first time trying that one, however the crispy beef was definitely the table favourite. Crispy.....seems to be the texture of the day for me."}
{"text":"New Sky is one of those places that for me, I would only go out of slight desperation (ie 3am and it's one of the 3-4 places that it actually open)

The place is always understaffed and you will have to flag people like crazy to get anything (water, tea, etc). It's pure agony. 

The food is just OK - you could do worse in Chinatown - okay - a lot worse. The menu has all your typical Cantonese dishes. Portions are huge and greasy, but that's pretty standard for the area. 

Their Moo Shu Pork is my regular order, but the seafood hot pot is a decent pick too.

It's not incredibly cheap either, for Chinatown, but if you're hungry at 3am it's a decent bet. If you are dining during normal hours, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"3.5* for late night food!

New Sky serves as a cleaner, roomier, and fancier late night alternative to kom jug down the street! 
Most options do not include carbs as far as noodles or rice are concerned. The beef tenderloin and lemon chicken were served in very generous portions and were delicious! I've also heard good things about the lobster but did not feel the urge at 3am.
Service was quick although not the most friendly, but that's understandable considering the hour of our visit and the volume of intoxicated patrons!
Overall New Sky is a safe bet if you're hungry in the wee hours of the night!"}
{"text":"A really correct Chinese restaurant. Lobster is good and not that expensive. Other meals are like in every Chinese restaurant. Can be very good or really \"surprising\". Staff is OK. Cleanliness is OK (at least for the kitchen and table).

May come back... not sure..."}
{"text":"I went here around 4:30 and service was great very friendly I asked to order from the Peruvian Chinese \" CHIFA \" menu. And once I got the food I was impressed I have recently come back from a stay in Peru since this is where my parents are from and it truly took me back, I took some home to my parents and they loved it and said it brought them back. The waiter was great about payment and 10/10 will be coming back my guest also truly enjoyed the food and he is a picky eater. Will bring my whole family next time."}
{"text":"Just going to put it out there: New Sky's staff is totally racist. I'm not full of righteous indignation or anything, and I don't plan on filing a human rights complaint, but there is big trouble in little China when a table of 4 white people have to wait an hour for a bowl of won ton soup and two-and-a-half hours to finish the meal, all the while with tables of Chinese families lapping us and turning over. I don't think my allegations are unfounded, either -- a white guy and his Chinese wife, sitting next to us, received similar treatment and discussed it before she got up to give the waitstaff a piece of her mind.

The food is pretty good here but maybe that's the strategy...make people wait until they are so unbearable starved that anything will taste good.

Best parts were the won ton soup, salt and pepper shrimp and general Tso's chicken (I know, not authentic but still tasty).

+3.5 stars for food, -1.5 stars for racism."}
{"text":"I was introduced to New Sky a couple of years ago and I'm so glad I was. There's something about this food that makes me eat and eat it. Even leftovers taste great and will keep me coming back for more. Highly recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Ok I discovered this restaurant two years ago. It was great and affordable with great food.

Fast forward and well, food is still okay but prices have been jacked up. Service is not great and...was just there and there we were eating and suddenly witnessed a six legged creature strolling on the wall - yes a ROACH! 

Sorry but I'm not fond of roaches. Funny thing is we had tons of leftovers as everyone basically lost their appetite.

Anyway food is fine but price increase and roach forces me to rate New Sky a 3."}
{"text":"Most of the food here was good. We ordered some fish dish and it was excellent. We also got some spicy fried bean curd dish and it was absolutely delicious.  The snow peas with garlic had a good flavourbut the snow peas were a bit tough and was probably old.

Portions are decent. Service is fast and no-frills."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was 9, loved it then and I still love it! They always ways remember return customers and make sure the food is to their liking.  Their service is mediocre, but their food is what gets me to come back :)"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. However if you want to dine in especially with family, you better make reservations for a table at the back of the restaurant. The restaurant becomes extremely busy especially during dinner time and since the tables are so close together with very minimal space, it gets very annoying having servers serve food to other tables bumping into your chair and/or serving food over your head. Although its a good restaurant, it needs to consider its' capacity and seating plan."}
