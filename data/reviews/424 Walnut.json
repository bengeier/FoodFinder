{"text":"First time I went I had probably the most tasteless $28 prime rib you could ever imagine, but I did notice on the website there is happy hour 4-6 on weekdays so decided to give it another try. Went in and kindly asked bartender what the happy hour entailed. The bartender proceeded to roll her eyes and then proclaim \"We don't do happy hour\" then briskly walked away......I hear the place recently re-open under new ownership. This place won't be open long..strongly advise to stay away!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a delmonico steak for lunch. Medium rare. Received a well done burnt steak. Veggies doused in oil/butter. Salad is greens with one small piece of cucumber and two small tomatoes. Dressing was good. Waited for the waitress to come back, I didn't want to eat the steak...waited and waited... finally gave up and ate it because everyone else at the table was well into their entrees.    Terrible.  I should've just waited.  I have eaten here a few times before.  I want it to be good, but it's just not."}
{"text":"10/10 would definitely recommend. The atmosphere is casual and friendly and the food is outstanding. The crab cakes were better than any I ever had on the Maryland coast. I was pleasantly surprised about that. The prime rib was melt in your melt."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very disappointed with the service at the restaurant. Our server mostly ignored us. He didn't even offer us bread which was a surprise for an Italian restaurant. We would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a sweet restaurant! My first time there today and everyone was so welcoming, I felt like family and I felt like I've been coming here for years! I had a steak salad and it was delicious! I am also a celiac and gluten free was easily accommodated!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for the first time. We both had the veal linguine and it was one of the best meals I had in a long time. The stuffed banana pepper app r timer was outstanding. Th blue berry chambourg cheesecake and the bread pudding was out of this word. The service was impeccable. Most of all the owner-host was, so friendly, accommodating and went out of his way to make you feel you wanted to come back again and again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Crab cake steals the show.  Greens & Beans super appetizer.  Nice wine and beer selection."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here on a weekday evening. I am confused on why this place was not more crowded. The food and service was terrific. The menu was exceptional. I most certainly will return - soon."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now and have had great service ,Jerry was our waiter very attentive .The food was fantastic ,I asked for scallops and Gorgonzola pasta they were not on the menu ,but I had them before. No problem they made them for me and they were Excellent .Atmosphere is always fun and busy I highly recomend !!!!"}
{"text":"Been several times.  Excellent food.  Recommend the capicola sandwich for lunch. For dinner you have to start off with greens and beans--the best.   Good service as well, typically easy to park"}
{"text":"If you like good food prepared with creativity and is a taste treat and pared with the perfect adult beverage along with service from kind human beings; then Walnut is for you. The owner Joe came over and introduced himself and was concerned if our dining experience was up to par. He even brought us a desert, that was a slice of delicious-ness! Our wait person Erin gave us guidance and was on point. She answered all of our questions with gusto! We are new to the area and are now devotees of Walnut, and look forward to many more dinners with great wine and conversation. Try the stuffed banana peppers, you will not be disappointed. Yum 5 out of 5..."}
{"text":"This place is much better than its current rating.  I stopped in while visiting friends on a work trip and the food was excellent. Great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and a nice menu.  The place has a nice sized bar on the left when you walk in and a nice dining area on the right side.  I'd give it more than 3 stars if it weren't for my veal and peppers that I ordered being very bland.  I was expecting a bit of spice to it, but was disappointed.  All-in-all if and when I am back in the area, I would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place doesn't have better reviews. We got stuffed pepper appetizer, stuffed salmon, and Creme brûlée. Literally everything was awesome.   I  consider myself a foodie, and 424 Walnut did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for drinks to check the place out. I ordered a MM Manhattan on the rocks. Good drink. I had two more. My check came to more than $36 before tip. I won't be visiting these robbers again. A Manhattan doesn't cost that much in Manhattan."}
{"text":"What a mixed bag!  The sausage chowder was truly amazing and the chicken parm was way above average BUT. Bathroom was scuzzy without tp. Waiter lacked most social skills. Complained about theater goers who only order appetizers and don't make him any money. Then he pointedly stood between our booth and the one across the aisle where we had a quiet, friendly conversation going on because he wanted our immediate attention.   Major choice to make down the road. Opt for very pricey but good food and hope for different server and better bathroom or just go to the many other Sewickley options.   Maybe 'take out' is the answer."}
{"text":"Passing through town and looked to Yelp for good spots to eat. We decided to try Walnut 424. The staff was very inviting and accommodating. They made us feel so welcome. Nice relaxed atmosphere and easy to get comfortable in decor. The food was excellent. Select cut Delmonico and truly perfect crab cakes. Generous size and no breading, just pure lump crab. My only complaint was that I like a traditional remoulade sauce and the chef serves a mustard based sauce. After hearing my request of our server, the owner came to the table and gave me his card. He said when I call and make reservation in the future, to request remoulade and they will have it waiting for me. Now how great is that ?!?!"}
{"text":"Greeted at the door by host/manager? Server offered drink, brought my wine and helped me decide among entrees. I chose the spots. They were meh served with zucchini with marinara that tasted suspiciously like Ragu and bland rice. Server never came back to offer 2nd glass of wine or check on me. Single woman diner, dismissed as unimportant. Service was more disappointing than food, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We come here often for lunch or an early dinner, as we have 2 small children and like to go during the slower hours. We are always well taken care of and the owner stops by several times to make sure everything is good and that the kids are happy! I LOVE the grilled cajun chicken sandwich with the melted blue cheese on top, its to die for! And they have the best skinny french fries EVER. Their beer selection is always pretty good and they have some awesome specials."}
{"text":"7 reasons why 424 Walnut received 5 stars:  1: Duck salad 2. Crab stuffed artichoke hearts 3. Grilled halloumi and vegetables 4. Lamb Pot Pie 5. Seafood Enchilada  6. Friendly, fast, and professional service 7. For the quality and quantity of food, the prices are very reasonable  You will not be disappointed. Try it tonight!"}
{"text":"So, I heard great things about 424 Walnut, which is why we decided to go there for my birthday dinner this year. It was not so great.  We got the halloumi and vegetables, they were good, although a little burnt.  I got the scallops which came with potatoes, salad, and broccoli slaw (cooked)  The first scallop was fine, it tasted good, good texture, the second made me gag. Something was wrong with them. I didn't eat any more than the one and 1/4. My stomach was upset for the rest of the night, and I just opened the togo container and it smells like something died in there.... No bueno  The broccoli slaw was literally the kind of broccoli slaw they sell at giant eagle, cooked, and completely a mushy mess. GROSS  The potatoes were so salty I thought I would choke on them.  The salad was blah. I wish the waiter would have told us that we could choose from the other salads, but he only told that to the table behind us after we had ordered.  The key lime pie was delish, but not good enough to make up for the terrible other food.   Oh and on another note. I was served my dinner and had to ask for a fork 3 times before someone actually remembered to bring me one."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, crab cakes are fabulous!! Greens and beans were so good and the deserts are really really great!  Best cappuccino ever !"}
{"text":"The staff is the second reason i go there. The first reason is the food.  Finally the atmosphere is grade in there"}
{"text":"Five star all the way! Food, quantity, quality, presentation, wait staff, decor, music, selections, can't say enough good things.  A tad expensive for a lunch, but spend the $$, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was not warm, seemed like it was made way b4 hand, soup was ok. Its a nice clean restaurant. Waitress was nice but didn't have much of a personality. Overpriced for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"My husband and I had two different veal selections.  The veal could melt in your mouth.  Mine was the veal with mild & sweet peppers.  Was just the right combination of peppers.  For an appetizer we had the artichoke stuffed with crab meat...excellent.  We even managed to save room for bread pudding for dessert; which was amazing."}
{"text":"The waiter was hard working and attentive. He was very helpful when we were selecting wine and the day's specials. Their crab cakes were amazing but the steak was salty and over cooked, therefore dry. I asked for medium rare and it came out almost like medium well. I had a bite of their seafood risotto and that was delicious. Kind of wished I had ordered that one instead of the steak.  The restaurant is located in a cute neighborhood. Inside was quiet enough that we were able to have conversations sans shouts or pardons."}
{"text":"Outta towner's getting food to-go.  Salads and soup were perfect for a cold rainy night.  But, dessert was off the charts.  Had bread pudding and the marscapone cheesecake.  Cheesecake was probably the best we have EVER had, anywhere.  And we do cheesecake.   Thank you 424 Walnut for coming through with flying colors of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and really enjoyed our meal here. Staff was super friendly and the owner was out making sure everything was amazing -  which it was! Especially enjoyed the grilled haloumi with grilled veggies - they were so smoky and flavorful would definitely get this again. Their Caesar salad was super refreshing and tasty.  I ordered the special lamb shank that was so tender and melted in your mouth!  It was served over a creamy and flavorful mushroom risotto that was the perfect accompaniment to the lamb.  Great meal - would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was a little bland. I got the stuffed salmon and I needed to add salt and pepper to it. Others in our party ordered the stuffed eggplant Parmesan and they liked it a lot. One other person in our party had the veal and peppers and it needed salt and pepper. The chicken soup had fat on the chicken and was not tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!  Great service.  Make sure you try the turtle soup!  WOW!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant out & I'm so glad we did.  We dined on crab cakes, Delmonico steak & seafood diavlo . Outstanding food. Best crab cakes I've ever had. Flavorful, melt in your mouth steak & a spicy seafood pasta dish that was a real palate pleaser.  We followed up dinner with the marscapone cheesecake.  Absolutely enjoyed our dining experience & our attentive server, Paul.   We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Best dinner ever!! Hats off to the chef. Homemade deserts!! Ohhh my! So full...I'm  going to roll home. Went back  again 4/16 mainly for the key lime pie the lamb chop was unbeatable"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with our lunch, initially went based on the variety on their menu, yet had many lunch specials which were very good. Crab stuffed artichokes were great, the grilled beet & pear salad with shrimp was very nice and very filling. My kids had the pasta special disk also very good. The waiter was very knowledgable and addressed our needs well. I would go back when I'm back in Pitt visiting RMU."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there were definite issues that should not happen in a place as pricey as this. First, no wine or drink list. The waiter kept telling me to tell him what I liked and he would make suggestions. I like a wine list. The Caesar salads came out undressed. We asked for Caesar dressing and were brought Roquefort. Main meals were good, but not as creative as the menu would have you believe. One of us got the filet and she was happiest. The shrimp and sausage was basic. The crab and angel hair was good, but way over priced for what it was. The atmosphere was fine, if a little plain. It was also warm, but we couldn't get the waiter to come back long enough to tell him."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Heard a lot about 424 Walnut from friends so thought we would give it a try.  Sooooo glad we did and we will be back.  My wife is gluten free and they are so accomodating.  Found out the crab cakes have NO bread or filler so she anxiously ordered them.  Excellent choice.  So tasty and full of crab....big chunks!   I had the veal chop milanese and it was tremendous.  Just spicy enough and huge portion.  Oh yeah....greens and beans with hot sausage as an appetizer was best I've had in a while.  Give this place a try....we will CERTAINLY be back!"}
{"text":"We just celebrated our 21st wedding anniversary at 424 Walnut and it was one of the best meals in our 21 years together.  The veal chop was the best I ever had and my wife's crab cakes were everything we heard they would be.  Our waiter Paul was fantastic and really made us feel at home.  We have found a new favorite place"}
{"text":"If you're looking up the definition of average in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of 424 Walnut. It should rate 2.5 stars I suppose. Food - Average Atmosphere - Average Service - Decent, but not overly friendly. Food Temperature  -not cold, not hot. Average"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Nice eclectic mix of menu choices.  Went with a party of four.  All of us enjoyed our meals.  Ambiance was just ok.  Service was attentive.  Only reason for the four star was that it was overpriced, even for sewickley."}
{"text":"I've been here once as a destination for dinner and once as a final stop in a progressive dinner for dessert.  I don't recall what I ate the first time, only that my friend and I were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed the atmosphere and the meal.  And please don't mistake that for an underhanded compliment; it's just that neither of us had eaten there before and didn't know anyone else who had either, so we had little to no expectation.  The more recent visit for dessert blew me away.  I didn't eat dessert last time, but in my quest for somewhere in Sewickley where we could get it, 424 was the only place that I was confident in having some sort of offering because, strangely, not a lot of the restaurants in this town do.  Anyway, we took a seat and asked after the desserts, and were pretty blown away by the selection, the fact that most (maybe all) were made in-house, and then when ours came out, they were incredible. We both had cheesecakes, my friend opting for the marscapone and I for the peanubutter chocolate.  Mine was so good, it was all I could do to stop halfway and bring the rest home for another evening, because the slice was quite generous.  As for the atmosphere, it's nice.  There's a bar, and everything is in a dark-stain wood.  The restaurant cuisine skews Italian/Mediterranean, and it's nicely done.  I think that perhaps it suffers a tiny bit from being a little off the beaten path--that is to say, not right on the main drag of Beaver or Broad St.  But that shouldn't deter anyone, really.  I'll keep this in mind the next time I'm looking to go out for a sit-down meal in the Village."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! A friend introduced me to this place and I will be sure to come back! We had a hard time choosing entrees because EVERYTHING looked so good.  We had the stuffed banana peppers for starters. It was stuffed with veal and had the most authentic Italian sauce....I wanted to eat it all day. The soup special was a cream crab and sausage which was such perfection that I asked if the chef could make it in batches for take out. Literally, the best soup I've ever had.  We followed that by the duck confit salad with strawberries and balsamic. The duck was cooked perfectly! Next we had the charred Delmonico...again, cooked to perfection. At this point the owner comes over to talk to us and I was impressed with his love and passion for food. He said \"If I give someone an amazing dish they will be loyal to me forever.\"  He was right, I am in love with this food! Before we left, stuffed to the gills, he brought us a piece of the -housemade- Blackberry, Chocolate, Chambord cheesecake. At that point I decided that the next visit was going to be a dessert tour of 424 Walnut. Yuuuum. Well done. Well done."}
{"text":"I went to 424 Walnut last night for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend and had an amazing meal with excellent customer service!  The atmosphere was friendly and quaint, the layout is accommodating for anything -  intimate dinner, larger groups, or just hang out around the bar.  I will definitely be back soon!  My boyfriend had a Caesar salad and the stuffed salmon and I had the steak salad, and we split the toasted coconut pie,  everything was delicious!  The homemade salad dressings were great and the portions were generous.  Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable, he made great recommendations off the menu and wine list.  They also had a great selection of seasonal craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Tip: call and make a reservation. Sometimes during the weekend this place is packed! There is bar seating though, so even if you call ahead you can ask the hostess if it's packed.   My experience: It is pretty good! I've been here twice and have ordered a special twice. Last time I was here they had Delirium Tremens on tap so I was a super happy camper. This time, no luck but I'm still happy with the selection. No real cocktail list and I was told they're working on creating a wine list. There is supposedly a list on the chalkboard by the bar but it isn't legible at all. I stuck with beer because they have a list that is legible.  I ordered the queen size prime rib (HUGE) medium rare (a special on the menu) with a sweet potato and French onion soup to start. The French onion soup was pretty good. Be sure to ask for some bread on the side. They have a tasty sourdough excellent for dipping.   I have always received excellent service here. Our waiter was pretty nice. The owner, Joe, is great. Had a conversation with him. Very attentive. I would definitely come back and invite a couple of friends!!! Hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Chicken risotto, prime rib, stuffed banana peppers, etc. it's all amazing. If by chance you're dining there on an evening when they are serving the lamb shank with truffle risotto special, it's your lucky day. It's the most amazing, fall-off-the-bone, tender piece of lamb I've ever had."}
{"text":"First time I have ever eaten at this place I heard through word-of-mouth  it was very good so I tried it. As far as atmosphere it was fine, as far as service service was normal,   it was good no complaints!  Pricing was excellent, but the main reason to eat at a restaurant is good food, and the food here was honestly very good!!  It was delicious!!! I heard from multiple people that the place had great food, so we tried it  and like I said food was on point!! For sure I recommend eating here.  We had stuffed banana peppers,  a serving of bread,   a salad,  cajun chicken sandwich, my fiancé had some chicken risotto dish, and my son had an angus burger with fries. We had not one complaint!!! We shall return!!"}
{"text":"424 walnut was way out of my comfort zone. Not because of the cuisine, but because it was in Sewickley! Sewickley to me is like Peru; far away and foreign. But we were meeting so family, so we braved the highways and bridges.   We started with the crab stuffed artichokes. It comes in a lemony butter sauce and bread it dip. I love bread. And I love lemony butter sauces. And I really love bread in lemony butter sauces. I could have happily slurped that right outta the bowl.   I went with something just on the cusp of daring for my entrée and ordered the chicken and penne. It was chicken with basil and prosciutto in a tomato cream sauce. It was so gooooood. The BF got the veal which came with veggies and some sort of potato. Veal not being one of my favs, I didn't try it, but considering the way he cleaned his plate with bread, I'll go ahead and say he loved it. Carla got the surf and turf which came with a crab cake and a steak the size of my head, and for those of you who don't know, I got a big ole' head! The steak was a pretty pink medium and fantastic. I didn't try the crab cake but she said they are wonderful. Matt, a true natural born raconteur, got the lamb shanks with prawns. That was one thing I found amazing about the menu; you could get things from a chicken salad or burger, to veal piccata to lamb shank with prawns. And everything was done well and delicious. In my experience, that's not easy for a restaurant to do.   For the finale we got a key lime pie and bread pudding, for the table. I didn't try the pie, but the BF said it was phenomenal. The bread pudding, which I insisted I was too full to eat but then ate quite a bit of, was equally as phenomenal.  On the ride home the BF said we should take a ride about and try it again, which for homebodies like us is the best review a place can get."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times...great food and service.  American cuisine and offers Italian features.  The only reason I give 3 stars is if your going to offer Italian dishes please learn how to make a cappuccino...the Cap is horrible at best.  If you call a Cap a couple shots of espresso with a little bit of warm milk...then please google \"How to make a Cappuccino\".  If you don't want to make it correctly then don't offer it."}
{"text":"I occasionally have business meetings in Sewickley so I figured I'd try this place out for lunch while I was there. It was rated well on Trip Advisor and appeared to have a good menu.  PROS: Nice atmosphere and comfortable seating, especially at the high top bar area tables. The steak salad and seafood soup was delicious.  CONS: I was the first patron to walk in on a Friday at 11:15. They open at 11. The owner or manager was at the hostess station and did not acknowledge me (he actually has his back to me upon entering and standing there) as he was busy fiddling around with his phone. The bartender finally came over and seated me. The waitress was nice, but it took awhile to get her attention to actually have her take my order; at least 10 minutes and by this time there was only ONE other table of three people in the entire restaurant. My food came and she was nowhere to be found so I had to ask the bartender for silverware. Really? That should have been placed when I was seated. The service was a bit slow considering another waitress was added during lunch time and only a few other tables of people were now seated. There is also only one bathroom and apparently the lock sticks as I heard while I was using the facilities and a man kept pulling on the door despite me stating, \"someone is in here.\"  I think it is overpriced for what you're getting, especially if you go at lunch time. I might go back."}
{"text":"Great crab cakes. Attentive wait staff. Great bartenders. I've eaten here several times and it's always good. The chef jimmy will accommodate dietary restrictions. Just tell him what you want and how you want it cooked and he'll do it special for you. The prime rib and streaks are good too. Great pasta dishes. If you have a dietary restriction this place will handle it with ease."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  Good prompt service.  Had a crab salad wrap that came with crisp french fries and a couple of fresh strawberries.  Enjoyed the crab wrap."}
{"text":"I think this place is one of the best kept secrets in Sewickley which tends to have very upscale restaurants with high end prices. 424 Walnut is comfortable whether you are by yourself sitting at the bar or with friends. The food has excellent quality, fair prices (including price of wine) and much charm. The only downer is one shared bathroom that is in desperate need of an upgrade- so go before or after and you will be fine."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this restaurant you need to go!!  I can't even begin to tell you how awesome the food, service and owner is at this place. I was in town for 4 nights and ate at this place 2 of the 4. If I would have found earlier I probably would have eaten here every night!!"}
{"text":"So, I was a little skeptical coming to some little place 'in the middle of nowhere', but sometimes those little hole in the wall places are some of the best. As soon as we (my mom and I) came in the door the staff politely greeted us and brought us two a nice little booth. Throughout the entire course of the meal, the staff was attentive and proactive in checking on us to see if we were satisfied or needed any refills as well. And now I'll talk about the food.   Here's what my mom thought: The Italian meatball soup was amazing and so filing. Also had the largest chicken Caesar salad which was also amazing. And to top it off a nice White Russian hit the spot. Great place, great food and wonderful service and staff! A must if you're visiting Sewickley!!!    My thoughts: I really just had a mixed greens salad which was pretty good, but I'm not really used to all that high class stuff. The Italian Chicken Breast I had was EXCELLENT! You know food is cooked well when you can taste each of the ingredients playing off one another, and I definitely could with this one!   Overall, the service, food, and atmosphere were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Today we had the pleasure of going to this great restaurant.  It is never easy to take a 2 year old out to lunch, but the entire staff treated us like we were family.  Add to that, the food was wonderful. The fish sandwich was huge and cooked perfectly. The pasta sauce was perfect, and the chicken delicious. We will definitely go back there again. I wish I lived here where I could enjoy this place on a regular basis. I know my kids will always enjoy this place. Thanks for being so good to us today."}
{"text":"We just finished a delicious lunch!  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting, and the food was exceptional. That's what keeps us coming back again and again."}
