{"text":"Went here intending to go to lunch, came out with just a tea instead because it feels weird to go into a place like this and not buy anything. We were put off with watching the lady running it wipe her hands on a dirty towel instead of washing them, and the milk which sat on the counter the whole time we were in there - not an inconsiderable time since she was making a few salads/sandwiches. Tea selection was good."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful surprise. If you work in the building I know you are a regular. The most sumptuous cheese eggy bagel sandwich in the world. Laurie does her own baking each morning, bagels, bread and muffins.  Her beef, pulled pork and chicken are all prepared with her special recipes. 
Multiple coffees will give you variety each time you go each time you go.
Lunch on many salads, soup of the day, or a fresh, to order sandwiches.
Only 4 tables, she mostly does take out in the building. The entrance is in front of the building,  located at the bottom of the parking lot, of Winners on Heritage."}
{"text":"November Challenge - 14/30

After a strange health scare in mid-October, I found myself heading to the Mythic Caf√© on the regular, since it's connected to my family doctor's office building. 

Mythic doesn't have many vegan or dairy-free options available, but all I ever need here is a PB&J multigrain bagel and a black coffee. Mythic does a pretty decent job with both, and with friendly service that makes you feel cozy and at ease. Even, when you've just been served up some scary ass news next door. 

Oh, and P.S., I'm super. Thanks for asking :)."}
{"text":"Soup soup soup...home made with love. Fresh made to order sandwiches and a book exchange. What else is there? A lovely lunch and some light reading, to stay or to go."}
{"text":"This place is small but personal. The owner is genuinely kind and gets to know all of her customers. 
Lunch time is busy because she makes everything from scratch and her homemade soups are (IN my opinion) her biggest drawing card. Their is a weekly special and sandwiches are made to order while you wait so they are always fresh. A great place too if you just want a latte and puffwheat square. Homey, friendly atmosphere and fantastic home cooking.  Glad to have this place in the neighbourhood."}
