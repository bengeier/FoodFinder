{"text":"Great burgers, very friendly staff. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I came in for a hot dog but ended up with a h9t link l. The owner gave me a complementary cup of soup. The hot link was definitely delicious but the soup really sealed the deal. Great place and one of my favorite out of town visits."}
{"text":"I don't quite get it to be honest (all of the very positive reviews).  The burger was edible but certainly not fantastic.  They were out of pretzel buns which was obvious after a lot of shouting between the cook and cashier.  Another review mentions they were out of thousand island dressing.  The potato salad did taste like it was from Costco as another review mentions.  The french fries were like saut√©ed potato chunks, not real french fries.  

A cool little place from a location perspective although even the decor could be a bit snazzier.

I know this is a family run operation and I'm sure the owners are very nice - but at the end of the day this place is way overrated."}
{"text":"Great Dogs! Arizona Dog with Guac is killer!
I had the Pittsburgher with Ham and cheese. It is Fantastic. The guy who runs the place is very friendly and actually came over and sat with us for a minute."}
{"text":"It's truly an amazing place to eat must try.....Great everything and they have everything anyone wants. must try hamburgers, hot dogs, ruben, salad, and the ice cream. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Must try"}
{"text":"The burger was great. You could tell the meat was hand made, not just some burger patty from Costco. The seasoning was quite well done as well.

The owner is also a really cool, nice guy.

Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Cute mom & pop burger place with ice cream! 
Not sure why they don't serve fries with their burgers though...
Randy is a great guy and takes time to socialize with his customers. Don't get that very often nowadays. 
Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very surprised and disappointed but my wife and I just had an experience very contrary to the majority of reviews on here.  We arrived at 1:50 Saturday afternoon placed our order for two burgers which comes with coleslaw sat down and preceded to wait 40 minutes for our food. To add insult to injury, the couple who ordered burgers after us got theirs first. The owner explained away to wait due to the fact that the cook went on break.  Really? He went on break after we placed our order and before he cooked it? Then came back and cook their order before ours? Not much sense. Once we did get our food, the burgers were so well done the neither my wife or I wanted to eat anything after the first bite. We had to ask for our coleslaw and initially was only brought one even though the same person (the owner) took and brought out our order. When we reminded him the both burgers came with slaw he said \"oh yeah I forgot to mark it down\". When I brought all of this to his attention he wanted to cook us another set of burgers but we no longer had the time due to the fact that we were now over the hour mark. At no time did he offer to refund the near $30 spent for two burgers home fries and 2 cans of soda. Such a shame considering so many good reviews. We will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Got a to go order. Burger with cheese and onions.  Side of potato salad. 2nd burger 1/2 pound with Swiss.  Both on pretzel buns. At home, I opened bag-No ketchup.  One napkin, 2 forks.  Potato salad definitely cannot be home made. Not that good. Tastes like Costco.  Topped with something weird... Like a cajun seasoning ? Burger was really dry.  Like,  get a glass of water dry. It almost looks like a meatloaf-y combo rather than just meat so I am surprised it was so dry. Slice of tomato was about 1.5 inches thick. Sloppy knife work.  Ate it separately.  Might go back,  but I doubt it.  Might try a hot dog. I wish the pretzel buns had salt on them. 

Place was small.  Nice enough.  5 or 6 tables.  Candy in wall display.  They have ice cream.  Didn't get any. Owner was very nice.  Hopefully,  the place is normally better on turning out hot dogs and burgers,  but there was no rush,  no crowd,  so not sure how the good wasn't cooked well. Next time,  hope to be able to eat more than 1/3 of the meal. Downed in ketchup to try to alleviate dryness,  but that didn't work. Kind of sad I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Fun little burger/hot dog/ice cream shop - great food and extremely friendly and attentive staff.  A genuine ma/pop business with some really creative menu items to try!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service...no fries here...would pass on the home potatoes...burger was good but not great...can't speak on the hot dogs...they do have cheap candy for the kids though"}
{"text":"Perfect location and I felt as if I stepped back in time. Patrons were all talking with one another as they enjoyed their meals -- it was no doubt facilitated by the owner and his friendly, outgoing nature. Extremely pleasant atmosphere. Our burgers were especially yummy and even our picky 6 year old approved of his kid's burger. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Randy's smiling face and upbeat attitude is really what makes this place, which is why it is receiving three stars instead of one or two.  The hot dogs are ok, definitely better than, say Circle K.  The burgers seem to be made with cheap, pre-formed frozen patties and are not very palatable.  Also, they don't have french fries like a normal burger joint, they have 'home fries'.  Not the same.  If I'm getting a burger, it had better come with fries.  Just sayin.  The sandwiches are on the small side for the price and are, again, just ok.  Be sure to have lots of time on hand because everything is made to order and takes a while, or order ahead.  I want to support this place, really I do.  But unless you want a free hug from Randy, you'd be better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is awesome but you have to know what to order:

Burgers are very good! Get the pretzel bun.
Big Willy hotdog is great and a lot of food.
Substitute chili for default sides, it's amazing!

And lastly, Randy is the man."}
{"text":"This place is such a pleasant break-away from the mundane chains and franchises in the area. The food is delicious. I had a dog, my husband a burger. Both were so good! It's got a simple, nostalgic feel that reminds me of the small town I grew up in. Very friendly. We'll go back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service and the owner Randy really cares about the people who come in.  Never miss a chance to visit if your in downtown!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Wimpy's. Let me start off by saying that if you are in a hurry, find a drive through, as it took my burger order about 25min to get to my table, and there was only a two top and a three top besides me. 
I ordred a 1/3rd lb. Thousand Island Burger + caramelized onions and a water.
After quite a wait, the burger was delivered without the Thousand Island sauce. I asked if they could add the sauce, they came back and told me they were out. 
In addition, half way through my burger I realized that I never received my water either. One last note, my burger was initially delivered without napkins or a fork for the cole slaw. I had to ask for them. The cole slaw is just \"ok\".

The burger patty was very tasty, but the burger as a whole was no where near being worth $9.00, especially since there is no waiter. You need to stand in line at the counter to order.

Randy is a really, really nice guy, so I will return a second time to give him a fair \"shake\".

I'm only writing this as feedback for the restaurant, in the spirit of continuous improvement."}
{"text":"Saw the name , read story about how place started had to go there. During a trip to AZ for spring training my group was looking for somewhere to all meet eat and then head over to Mesa for a Cubs game. I suggested this place as it seemed to be kid friendly. Well let me tell you place was spot on . We arrived a group of 10 and Randy the owner was very accommodating. Pulled two tables together sat down with us and talked for a while. He shared stories from his past and then took our orders. Everything was good as expected with dogs and burgers, Randy made the experience worth sharing. During our conversation I told him my nickname was Wimpy. At first he was sceptical but after telling him my story he knew I was Wimpy. Took a picture with him and off to spring training we went. I will be returning next time I'm in Arizona for food and atmosphere.. and yes kid friendly... Thanks Randy your friends from Chicago..."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning by recommendation to try the biscuits and gravy.  Glad I did!  Not only was the sausage gravy delicious, but the eggs, bacon, and sausage were great too.  A hearty and very well-cooked breakfast at a great price.  
What's better, the customer service!  Everyone in the restaurant were so kind and friendly.  I left feeling more than compelled to make sure any curious Yelper will check this place out for themselves."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times and the down home friendly service and atmosphere keeps me coming back!   It is truly a mom and pop shop.  I am frequently waited on with smiles from mom and pop.  I love their Nebraska angus beef burgers and today I had their hot Italian sausage with grilled peppers and onion sandwich.  It was heavenly!  The bun was soft and chewy and the sausage, peppers, and onions were so flavorful.  It was a party on my tongue!  Yum!  I highly recommend this restaurant and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"\"Phenomenal food! Didn't feel disgusted and heavy like how you do when you eat burgers at those other places. This place is definitely the best!\" -says my husband
The owner Randy was super friendly too. You can tell he really just wants you to be comfortable and make his place your home. Me and my husband just moved to the chandler area and he told us all about the sights in the area everything like that. I would be more than happy to be a regular at Wimpy's."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking along and stumbled upon this literal paradise! First things first, they show so much support out front for not only gay equality but the Chandler PD and military so it's fantastic. We were created by the nicest man I've met in a very long time. He was attentive and professional and so thankful to have us. Now the food, AMAZING. We both got burgers that were so full of flavor and cooked to perfection and came to us right off the grill. I noticed this restaurant also was the only one promoting a Veterans Day discount to former and active military. It's surrounded by huge restaurants and none of these big time places showed any patriotism and this place was full of it and it's honestly so nice to see.  My girlfriend and I will be returning very soon and anyone lucky enough to come upon this place should take up the opportunity and try it! The customer service, food and all around vibe is utterly fantastic."}
{"text":"Great burgers and even better dogs. True Midwest flavor.  Staff is just as great as the food!"}
{"text":"Best hamburgers and hot dogs! Fresh not frozen! Chili is so good with no beans which is perfect for a chili dog. They also have a thrifty ice cream which I love. The malts and great too! This is a perfect mom and pop shop in Downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"ThIs place is delicious! We had burgers and they tasted amazing! The home fries were good too! Make sure to grab a shake... We had a grasshopper and it was fantastic! The owner made us feel important the entire time we were there, he came to our table and talked to us. I even overheard him making any accommodation to the menu he could for the table next to us to ensure happy customers. To me, that shows how much he genuinely cares about customers which is such a nice quality in a busy world! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went back  with  my nom, daughter, and nephew.   They loved it.  Games there kept them busy while waiting  on food.  My hard to please  nephew,  he's 9, loved  his cheese burger and fries.   Everyone  loved there food.  Will be  back."}
{"text":"Do not attempt to eat this food.  It was the worst food I've ever eaten.  The so called home fries were some sort of tasteless, lard ridden, soggy potatoe yuk. The chilli in the dog was manwich with spice.  It didn't even resemble chili.  

For a group of four people eating hot dogs with 4 drinks it cost 34.00. Oh my, what a complete ripoff. 

I cannot believe people have given this dive more then one star.  

Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall place, with extremely friendly staff. Oh, they also have excellent burgers, hot dogs, and chili. My wife had the burger (with green chilies and guacamole, her topping choices)  and I had the chili cheese dog (sloppy of course). Burger meat and the no-bean chili were both top notch, food was prepared quickly, and prices were reasonable.

Would love to come back to try some of the other options on the menu, like the Twinkie hot dog, or the fried peanut butter sandwich with banana and bacon. They also serve a large selection of Thrifty ice cream and have a fun candy and drink selection, including at least three Twinkie varieties."}
{"text":"One word: Overrated. Good service. Friendly owner. I almost feel bad giving 3 stars (I really wanted to give 2 stars) because I'd like to support small, local businesses but I cannot recommend it as food was just ok at best. Super small joint. Virtually no A/C. Waited a long time for our burgers. Nothing special. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't normally review hamburger joints but this little place in Downtown Chandler deserves kudos for being pretty darn good!  The hamburgers are perfectly seasoned and the brioche buns are excellent and at $6 -$8 depending on size and extras, what a great value.  

We definitely recommend Wimpy's and will be back soon and often!   Don't let decor (or lack thereof) fool you...the food is really good and reasonable."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, all homemade.  But beyond the food is just the best family owned and operated place around.  Genuine and loving people who just want to put a smile on their customers faces."}
{"text":"Great burgers and possibly even better hot dogs!  Didn't try the shakes, but the word on the street says they're also crazy good.  Plus, the owner is a super nice guy.  :-)"}
{"text":"Very cool place. The only suggestion I would make is to patty your own burgers. The frozen, pre-made ones suck. The old-school Hostess desserts, RC soda and YooHoo is just rad. Support the local guys, check it out!"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in here! Old school little spot with great food. The place was busy the whole time we were there. We had a Chicago dog, an Arizona dog, and a half order of home fries. Everything was on point! We will be back to try a burger next time. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Really great burgers and hotdogs. Which they had French fries, onions rings, or just better sides in general. Make sure you check the hours before you go. 

If it wasn't for the lack of sides, I would have easily given 5 stars. So if you just want a great burger or hotdog, then this is a great place to visit!!!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place is what it would look like if my dad decided to open up his own burger shop. Very friendly, cute, and I would go back purely for the atmosphere. I got the smallest burger they have, with american cheese no onion no tomato. If you want sauce, I would ask. The burger tasted homemade, and fresh. Lots of seasoning in it. Potato salad tastes great to me, I suggest you try that as well. All in all, you should try this place at least once regardless of the reviews. Nice mom and pop type of shop."}
{"text":"This is probably the best burger I have had in Phoenix. The seasoning they use on the meat is great. I was a little bummed that fries don't come with the burger. But potato salad does and it is really good. On top of the good food the service was great. They made a special patty for my girlfriend, the owner is super friendly. This is a great place and I will be going back."}
{"text":"I have been there for lunch few times.  Owner Randy always so nice and friendly!  They have very delicious burgers and hot dogs at very reasonable prices.  Love it!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow this this burger brought me back to when I was a little kid my grandma used to cook me a burger in a cast iron pan with a crapload of oil some burgers like super crispy you could smell the grease in the burger pretty good not the best I've ever had by far but still a really good burger maybe just because of the fact that remind me of my grandma now definitely don't know how to run a business first softer out of french fries and they were out of ice cream so no milkshake the guy I talked to permits blame because they are closed on Monday and since it was Tuesday they were out a lot of stuff the place is a little cluttered and looks dirty though but definitely a place to go give it a try if you want a good burger that's not way overpriced like a lot of these new places coming up"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple of times now and have been very happy with our experience. 
Everyone that works here will take the time to talk with you and they just make you feel welcome. 
The burgers are awesome. I've also had a hot dog which was good as well. 
The staff make the place great but the burgers keep us coming back. 
looking forward to trying Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"Hesitate to review at the risk of sounding repetitive. Food is outstanding. The burgers are okay, but I usually go Hot Dogs. My favorite is the Pittsburgher with added bacon. Best dog I've ever had. My usual tends to be the fried bologna sandwich which is out of this world and if I'm lucky they can swap out the mayo for Miracle Whip (Yes, I'm one of THOSE people) ;)). The best part about the place as has been said is the \"vibe\". They always treat me well as a customer and as a person. I feel like they genuinely care about me and that's a breath of fresh air. One of my favorite places to bring a friend. Keep up the good work Randy and co.!"}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere, burgers were amazing ( will try the hot dogs next time, I'm betting they will be unlike any other hot dog I've tried before) and incredibly friendly service.  It's a great place for lunch and very family friendly. 
You will leave here feeling like you just had a great meal with old friends, even if it is your first time here. 
10/10 will be back :)"}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast. Service was ok, We were greeted promptly. Took a bit to get our order to us. They had just finished with a morning rush. So I'm guessing they were recouping a bit. Ordered basic scrambled eggs ham and toast. came with country potatoes. Food was good. No Frills here. Like eating at a friends house. Stop in and grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"We tried this place after learning of it through Living Chandler, and think it's great! Randy is always such a pleasure, and the restaurant has great character as well. We've been once for breakfast and once for lunch, both times the food was great. Also the prices can't be beat! We highly recommend Wimpy's Paradise."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. It's really chill and the foods great! Randy the owner was so nice and provided the best customer service. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food, as we just stopped in for a quick milkshake, which was good (they use Thrifty ice cream). It's a cute little shop with a handful of tables and the service is not super speedy, but the owner Randy is one of the friendliest guys you'll ever meet. He sat at our table and talked with us for a while. We found out our teams are rivals...but he did tell us if the Browns beat The Steelers, our next lunch is on him...so we still have to cash in on that :) LOL! This is obviously a labor of love for him so we'll continue to support this local establishment."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. My favorite is the Pittsburgher hot dog with peppered bacon on it! Randy and his staff there is fantastic and helpful. I have special diet need and they do what ever they need to to help me with them. I highly recommend stopping by and grabbin something to eat."}
{"text":"Yummy! I had the Dirty Burger. Great chili and the burger was tasty all by itself. NO WAY you can eat this beauty without a fork. They also have a nice selection of Mexican Coke in bottles and Cactus Cooler which I can't seem to find anywhere. Definitely the least pretentious place around here and very friendly owner and staff. I don't know what stick went up someones rear with the negative reviews, but I noticed that they are mostly people that have few reviews and friends so I question their voracity. Either way, give it a shot, it's great backyard BBQ food in a cute little place by nice folks. Give it a shot. Also, BTW they have free WIFI, Thrifty Ice cream and a nice candy collection for the kidos!"}
{"text":"I was eating outside at this restaurant while attending a car show and witnessed a very unprofessional demonstration by Wimpy's owner - He was shouting at a female volunteer. The man continued to cause a scene stating that \"no one was eating at his business\" (um, hello? paying customer here!). After the woman politely asked the man to lower his voice, he placed his hand on her shoulder in a very intimidating manner. Other volunteers began to gather and waved down two sheriffs who were walking toward the yelling, all was resolved out of my sight but it was a very absurd scene that no business owner should portray themselves with."}
{"text":"Nice old school atmosphere. Food was great very fresh and made to order. We will be back"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to spend a Sunday morning! Great food, good vibe and friendly staff made for a nice brunch experience. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Randy makes great burgers and dogs! A must try in the downtown area. My fave the Freddie G."}
{"text":"Grab a Reuben, and stay for the company of the owner. They have Coke in the bottle too:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were eating this food back when it was just Pittsburgh Willy's at the antique market! We love it! The food is simple, often something we coI'll and would make at home, but that is why it is good. It is home cooking that you don't have to make yourself! I was pleasantly surprised this morning when I found out that they have a breakfast menu!  I had the fried bologna sandwich, which was made with a thick slab! It was very good. My husband had a cheesy mess of breakfast tasty! And these were big plates of food!

About the service. The food comes out much faster now-a-days, which is probably because they have a bigger area to work in, and I am so excited for them! The food is hot and fresh. The owner, Randy, is the first face I have always seen, even back at the antique market, and he seems so stoked to have customers. Such a good atmosphere at this legitimate mom'n'pop shop.

Check them out!"}
{"text":"I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a properly seasoned hamburger today.

My family has been to Pittsburgh Willy's and we enjoyed it.  I can't say the same for Wimpy's.  My friend and I both ordered the burger.  The burger was missing the unctuousness of a great burger, and was more like a drier, backyard burger.  Worse was that the seasoning was off.  A great burger only needs salt and pepper, this burger has had something else - like celery salt, maybe? - that was off putting.  A good dose of ketchup helped but wasn't good.  

If this place wants to do burgers it need to get down the seasoning and add fries and onion rings.  Why bottled iced tea?  I would bet a bottle of tea costs them more than a gallon of fresh brewed.   I may come back with the kids for a dog, but I won't be hurrying back for a burger."}
{"text":"Randy provides what we are all missing in our lives... a place that feels like home. He is warm and welcoming and feels like an old friend right away.  He will make you a meal specific to you... listening carefully and making suggestions.  His burgers are delightful... but there is so much more on the menu worth trying.  Nothing better than Wimpy's!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how great this place is. My wife reached out on a Facebook group asking for great biscuits and gravy in Chandler, AZ. The owner of Wimpy's responded saying that he made biscuits and gravy on Sunday mornings. My wife thanked him, but told him the reason we wee looking for biscuits and gravy was for my dad, who was visiting from out of town and was leaving Saturday night. Randy (the owner), said he would open early on Saturday and make my dad biscuits and gravy. Not only did we receive incredible customer service, but he made excellent biscuits and gravy, lots of sausage in the gravy, just like my dad likes it. We will be back over and over. If I could give this place a 10 star rating I would."}
{"text":"Finally tried Wimpy's Paradise in downtown Chandler today. Small family business with great food and world class customer service. The pics I took are of the A-frame outside their shop.  I love everything about what these owners stand for. (Oh yeah, they're Steelers people too!!! ) I had a burger and got a free hug from Randy, the owner. He's AMAZING!  pretty sure this place will be the only place I go for burgers from here on out. Thank you for spreading love Wimpy's!!!! If you haven't been you MUST go and support this awesome family business!"}
{"text":"Went to Wimpy's yesterday for the first time at the recommendation of the Living Chandler Facebook group. It's very cute on the inside and out. Ordering style is different. Have a seat with a menu and order at the counter. You also help yourself to drinks in the refrigerators. Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and food is very good. Only reason I have to dock them a star is because they were out of French fries. How do you not have fries when you serve burgers. Boo to you for that. Otherwise, it was nice. We aren't close by to this place so we won't be able to stop in as frequently as we'd like but we'd recommend you stop in and try them out."}
{"text":"Have been here for dogs which are great and decided to try Randys biscuits and gravy. GREAT! and very generous for a very fair price. Side of sausage is enough for two. Randy always asks how your food is.Small but friendly and good."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little restaurant that serves great food! The burgers taste great as does the potato salad but my new favorite is the chicken and rice soup. The owner and his wife are very nice."}
{"text":"We tennis gals dropped in after a match and enjoyed the burgers, home fries and good ole Mexican coke.   Owner entertained us with wonderful stories.  Delightful place."}
{"text":"Recently stopped by to try out their breakfast menu. Kept seeing posts about Wimpy's biscuit and gravy plate. Ordered the two biscuit plate since I was sharing with my son. The biscuits were cut down the middle which helped get the gravy all over the biscuits. The biscuits were very tender, gravy was loaded with sausage. It was definitely a big plate, both of us couldn't finish the plate. Writing this review now, of course I wish that I had! We also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes- they were seasoned well. However, they definitely need to be crisped up some more to really take it to the next level. I'm looking forward to another Sunday to have another go at these biscuits!"}
{"text":"GREAT root beer floats and award winning hot dogs. Super friendly,  family atmosphere."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just returned from this wonderful little place. We were looking for a small lunch and Ice cream place and I found this place on yelp. Super nice people that work there, or maybe own not sure.
The food was amazing and so was the ice cream.
I cant get over how nice the people are there. I have 3 kids, my 2 boys are 4 and 2 and my daughter is 9. This is now my daughter and I's place to escape to get away from all the boys at our house.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience 

The breakfast menu isn't too big. My husband ordered the special burrito and I ordered biscuits and gravy and a cup of coffee.  My biscuits came first.  They looked okay but were really salty and not to my liking -2 stars (one for each biscuit)

My husbands special burrito came. (Don't remember the name, top of the menu) I tried his dish and it was super dry, no flavor and bland. -1 star."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here.  Owner and service was excellent, that alone makes you want to come back.  Burgers were great,  I ordered home style potatoes and the owner said they were out right now but we're cooking some fresh.  He sent some out to us later and they were delicious would be great for breakfast. They have a really good selection of bottled and canned drinks. We topped it all of with some quite tasty ice cream.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Downtown Chandler. Try the Wimpies 1/2 pounder with green chilies or the big island burger. Amazing."}
{"text":"Great place for an ice cream treat! 
The main food & menu is lacking in quality though. Dogs are dogs and burgers are burgers. I can tell they are trying here though. Food seemed fresh. 

The place is cute and matches the name. It's happy & cheery as well as, which I assumed, was the owner walking around & visiting tables. He's a SUPER nice guy! 

I felt as if I was at a neighborhood picnic/BBQ though. Paper plates, plastic silverware and tables. Would have really liked an option of onion rings or fries with my burger. Aren't those a staple comfort food? 

My sister ordered a dog with the pretzel bun. The bun was too big and the tasty dog was lost in a sea of bread. She ended up using a fork & omitted the bun. 

The beans were DEELISH but, again, served in a foam container with a plastic fork that I had to retrieve. Are we at a cookout here? If that's what Wimpy's is striving for, they are spot on. 

I do recommend them for their ice cream treats and candy selection as well as some off the wall old times drinks & sodas."}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing and the customer service matched the burgers!  I will be returning to eat here in the future."}
{"text":"I am visiting the chandler area for an internship here. I have eaten at all the staple restaurants here and can hands down say that this place has been the best! You can TASTE the quality of the beef they use. Best burger I have had in years! If you care about quality and great tasting food, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the beans and cole slaw very much but no one in my family likes the taste in the burger.   It was very overpowering.  The beans were a bit pricey.  The place is cute but small.  The kids were unhappy that there weren't fries.  The menu was very limited and we probably won't return because of the strong taste in the meat.  

We are eager, however, to try the hot dog place when it opens."}
{"text":"We went to this place based on a magazine article. We were disappointed. Worst chili ever!  Canned tomatoes?  More like soup than chili. Who thought this should be put on a hamburger or hot dog?  $25 for 2 burgers, a cup of chili (inedible) and 2 cans of soda. Don't waste your time. Or money. Hit In&Out instead. Or Big Earl's in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Wimpy's, and we loved it!! We had burgers, potato salad, and the home style potatoes. Everything was full of flavor & completely fresh! We had an amazing old-fashioned banana split to end the meal. I cannot say enough about the owner, Randy. He is extremely friendly & kind! Our daughter has severe food allergies & couldn't eat there, but he gave her some popcorn which made her day! We will be back!! :)"}
{"text":"There's nothing to update...same great food...same great service...your fault if you aren't here!"}
{"text":"Very  burgers so tasty. Sat on patio and just enjoyed. Burger was loaded with cheese grilled onions and green chilis. A little too much mayo in potato salad but did he a good flavor.  They need to have types are of burgers with these items instead of add ins. They do have a condiment bar. They do need a soda fountain instead of just cans of soda. Very friendly staff. I'd return."}
{"text":"AMAZING! This is one of the best burgers I've ever had! And definitely the best in Arizona. Tastes just like the Midwest!!! Theres no doubt that you completely exceeded my expectations! So good. Everyone needs to check this place out!!!! The owner is Wonder he took time to chat with his customers, he had us all laughing!!! I got the big buck 1/3 lb burger and the quality is amazing, the slice of bologna is huge! The portions for the price is unbelievable! You need to come check out this place for yourself!!!!!!!! ENJOY!!!! I'll be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some ice cream and to talk about the Pittsburgh scene. They knew about City Chicken an Chipped ham. Good to talk to a Pittsburgh fan."}
{"text":"I will start with the positives. Super friendly and inviting owner! It was also very family friendly. There were a couple mom's with their children there and he interacted with them so nicely. You can also appreciate the hometown, casual feel that he created in the restaurant. I went there around lunch time for a \"to-go\" order so I understand it can be a bit busy, but it took close to 30 min for a grilled cheese sandwich and home fries. The quality just wasn't there. The sandwich was slightly burned and poor quality gritty cheese. The fries tasted awful as well. Very greasy! I actually threw them away after a few bites. This had no bearing on my rating but just putting this info out there. They didn't have ketchup packets. I asked for ketchup and he squeezed some in a styrofoam container and covered it w/ foil. No biggie...just thought it was a little strange. I really wanted it to be good so that I can leave a great review so it makes me feel bad to do otherwise. My hope is that my feedback will help them raise the level of quality of food to match the high level of customer service."}
{"text":"Burger rocks!  Wish we had more places like this.  Great hospitality and excellent flavors."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh. The meat is ground here, piping hot to the table. The flavor was fantastic. Most places serve previously frozen, bland burgers. I was pleased not to receive a massively greasy wad of meat slapped on a stale bun. I see Wimpy's being a regular spot in the heart of Downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Not bad, not great....fairly decent. I got the burger with the chili and mac. Like I said, it was good but I wasn't amazed by it. When I was reading the reviews, I really expected this place to knock my socks off, but like I said, I wasn't totally amazed. To be 100% honest, I don't have a huge urge to go back. The guy who works the register & takes orders was a really nice guy and was always trying to accommodate, so that's really why I rated this place as highly as I did. Otherwise, if I want a burger or some comfort food, I'll definitely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Exactly what this area needs! Simple and to the point! Definitely caters to all ages, families and couples alike.

My kids loving going to Wimpy's because of the friendly staff, candy and ice cream incentive and drinking soda from a bottle on the patio! For the kids the price can't be beat.... a home-style real beef burger kids meal, for the same price as a processed, trans fat happy meal. There's no question in that department!

The adult sized meals are just as wonderful. Many comments below mentioned that the burger lacks seasoning, but this burger place has perfected a healthy, tasty all-beef burger with a wide array of fresh deli cheeses that can satisfy anyone's taste. Nothing shipped in, nothing processed or with additives.... just a grilled burger on your choice of bread with your choice of cheese and toppings. You don't get much better than that!

And the fact that this is a locally and family owned restaurant, you can be sure to see constant additions and changes to the menu to keep things fresh and exciting."}
{"text":"First time visit to Whimpy's. No parking available, so we ordered to take home. I had the 1/2 lb burger with Swiss and green chilies. My husband had the Dirty Burger and both were delicious! The owner is super nice and while I was waiting I met friendly transplants from NJ and IL. Sunday breakfast comes highly recommended, so we're looking forward to trying that. If you haven't tried Whimpy's, you're missing a really good burger and friendly locals."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch. I got a cup of chili, friend got a special burger they had with other stuff on it like BBQ beef and grilled onions, I guess. We asked for french fries and we were told they weren't ready because they take three hours to make (just after 11am, so definitely lunch time).

The hamburger was unimpressive. It seemed to come from a pre-formed frozen patty. The meat and other stuff on top tasted of nothing. The potato salad we got instead of fries was inedible, not good at all, tasted like it came out of a plastic container.

The chili was greasy, a little spicy, and had a couple of little pieces of hard stem or wood or something in it. Tasted a little like a sloppy joe canned prep with some added tomatoes and hot sauce. There was cheese on it but there wasn't much flavor to it or it was overwhelmed by the hot sauce in the chili.

Two stars because: the guy who owns the place is exceptionally friendly. He brings you out your food after you order it by the register. They do have a prime location in downtown Chandler. Not three stars because: he never comes back to ask you how it is, and because the place is dingy with knickknacks everywhere. Very scattered and somewhat confusing."}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp when I typed in \"best burgers in Chandler\".  It is the one local owned joint that pops up, so I took some employees there as a reward lunch.  The owner is an awesome individual that is legitimately a happy and friendly person.  The food was great! We had burgers and fried bologna sandwich.  Great diner greasy food."}
{"text":"We thought this place was very charming and had a real mom-and-pop type feeling. We had a great burger, beans, and potato salad! Excellent service! Randy and his staff are very welcoming and friendly. It's nice to support a local business with such kind staff and good food."}
{"text":"The owner Randy was so nice. Sat down and talked to us and told us about the place and the food.  Had the 1/2lb cheeseburger with grilled onions.  It was delicious.  Love this place and we will be back!  

Came back for Sunday morning one breakfast. Wife loved the Seven-Up biscuits and sausage gravy.  Great little place.  We are there three times in 6 days!   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This one is one of my favs downtown hot dog on a pretzel bun. Plus the awesome customer service just nice n real people. There is a lot more comfort foods to explore in the menu but I keep going back to my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and the pork n beans were the best I've ever had. My wife had the chicken and wild rice burrito and gave me a bite, and it was fantastic. I had the big buck burger...it was pretty heavy and extremely greasy, but delicious. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great prices and delicious food! Randy and family are so welcoming! Wimpys was closed this morning so we tried the restaurant down the way and overpaid for average food.  Try to his place! You'll go back"}
{"text":"Hidden jem! Biscuits and gravy was extremely good!
Family owned amd operated a great was to support local economy."}
{"text":"The Arizonan dog is so delicious! I'm picky with my guacamole and there were now chunks of onions which was a major plus for me now when it comes to dessert their banana Twinkie is a MUST try! Banana topped with creamy PB and Nutella held together with a Twinkie bun, so delicious! Will be back for a burger next."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super casual atmosphere. I actually sat with the owner, Randy, and shot the breeze with him as I ate. If you like a good classic messy cheeseburger or loaded up hot dog, you gotta stop by and say hi. 

I built a burger with the big patty, American cheese, fried onions, bacon, and mayo. Paired that with the home style taters and a Mexican coke. ***Boom*** Super comfort food... So good. 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great ice cream and even better people! This was our first time here and we loved the small business feel it had to it. We will definitely be back to try the food."}
{"text":"Stop by for one of their famous Pittsburgh dogs. It was unbelievable. You have to make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"GREAT burgers! I suspected the lean to fat ratio was 70/30 because the patty was very tasty and juicy, but I asked and it turns out it's a pretty healthy 80/20. Just really good beef. I also had the potato salad side, which was right on. Really good and reasonably priced. Very pleasant owner, too."}
{"text":"Cute little place! Loved the retro decor and treats.
Burger was fantastic! Price was reasonable and service was awesome! It is a little small so don't be surprised if seating is tough. Not good for large groups and they only had one high chair. When we came with our 1 year old it was already in use so she just had to sit on our lap, no biggie but it would have been nice if there was a 2nd high chair. All that being said, we definitely loved the place and will be back!"}
{"text":"WOW! I think we found our new spot for breakfast and lunch. This place is located in downtown Chandler. The name refers to the character Wimpy from Popeyes who always asks for a burger that he would pay for on another day. We had hotdogs and they were delicious! I had the Mac and cheese chili dog and my husband had chili cheese dog. Amazing chili and inexpensive too! Next time we will do the burgers and hope to get up early enough one morning to catch breakfast. LOVE LOVE that this is not a chain or Corp business. It's small inside and also a place to eat outside. We DEFINITELY will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"These burgers!! These sides!! These people!!! ALL WONDERFUL!!!!

Flavorful, moist and fresh beef burgers served up casual by people who treat you like an old friend! 
The potato salad is so wonderful and creamy... It could rival your great granny's famous recipe! 
THE BAKED BEANS!!! Holy cow! They have a little bit of seasoned pulled pork spliced in with the tangy, sweet sauce and tender beans. 
Many, many great beverage selections to accompany your meal, as well as great old fashioned candies to delight the kid in everyone.
Right on the main drag of downtown chandler!
Eager staff who know how to please their customers, paired along with adorable artwork and tasty eats makes this place a MUST!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Steelers fan ; but this place is definitely a temple of a tribute to Pittsburg teams. The owner Randy is extremely personable . They were in new times for an awesome hamburger ! It's 5 patty's , 5 pieces of cheese , and 2 eggs on a bun . If you can beat the record of 6 1/2 minutes you get it free, otherwise as long as you finish it in 30 minutes you will get your picture on the wall. I'm in decent shape . The over 2 1/2 pound beast hurt me , it took me 24 hours to even think about food again lol. The free hugs are legit !"}
{"text":"Best burger by far! And Randy, the owner, is doing everything right! When you leave a dining experience thinking you wouldn't change A THING... That's a rare thing. Freshest ingredients! Friendliest atmosphere! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a while.  Yelp reviews are generally very good.  We were going to come a few months ago but this is a mom-and-pop place, and they had some sort of family emergency (based on the phone recording).  So they were closed.

Today they were open.  Parking is a nightmare.  That's not the fault of Wimpy's.  There are a lot of interesting eateries here, and some other shops, so it has become a very popular area.  We circled a couple of times before we spotted someone getting into their vehicle to leave.

Wimpy's is kind of a dive.  I don't mean that in a negative way.  It's very folksy.  Photos on the wall, a mixture of Star Wars and Pittsburgh Steelers stuff and cutesy sayings.  Not at all refined, which is fine.  A greasy burger joint. There are only a few tables, but fortunately one was open for us.  

We both ordered a Wimpy burger (1/3#).  I upgraded my side to an order of fries (instead of potato chips) for a small up-charge.  Fries are a country fry, not conventional French fries. Seasoned and greasy.

The burgers were very good.  Not dry at all.  Basic toppings (though I removed the pickle).  It didn't knock my socks off, but it's a burger.  Ground-up cow.  There just isn't that much to them.  This one seemed to be made from a quality beef, made fresh by hand (it wasn't a perfect disk), and was adequately moist.  It was a good burger.

The \"fries\", as I stated already, were seasoned and greasy.  Good flavor, though.  A slight \"kick\" to them, but not too much.

For what Wimpy's is it's good.  It's a burger joint.  Next time I may try either their chili burger or one of their dogs.  Probably my only criticism would be that because burgers are very basic one of the things that can set them apart are special toppings.  Another burger joint I like has unique things like jalapenos and portobellos (among other things) available.  It might not hurt if Wimpy's offered something like that, or maybe a daily burger with unique/different topping combinations.  However, to their credit, they did do some of that with their hotdogs.  I noted, for example, the Greek dog that included feta cheese and kalamata olives.  Taking the ordinary hot dog and making it different.

Their menu also featured some different salads.  Personally I find the lettuce and tomato that comes on the burger to be more than enough salad.  But for those who don't, they offer some more.

Service was very friendly and personal.  One of the good things about a mom-and-pop operation, which this is.  This is not a chain or franchise.  The folks behind the counter own the place.  It's their baby.  And their interaction with their customers showed it.

Oh.  And as of this writing they have a burger challenge.  If you can finish their 2.5# monster burger in about 6 minutes (or less) it's free.  It's a stack of 5 1/2# patties with some cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a fried egg on one bun."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, both in taste and size. Tried the new creation with spam, fried baloney and a fried egg on top and it was the best burger I've ever had. Apparently also available with bacon and a defibrillator.

Eat here before you go to Murphy's or Santan Brewing next door and you probably won't get a hangover it was so greasy and delicious. Or to make sure you could get a tasty milkshake instead to wash it all down.

Owner was also nice and friendly and the place was a great deal for so much food, almost felt bad for using the ridiculous 25% off coupon. Hope to come back and eat here again real soon, would gladly pay full price next time."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good burger place and I finally found one in Arizona that passes my test. I had the Ultimate Dirty Burger and it did not disappoint. I was wearing my Ohio State shirt when I walked in the owner Randy asked me if I was a Browns Fan and did I see his sign. I said I am and no. The sign said We reserve the right to refuse service to Cleveland fans. We both laughed and No I was not refused service...actually it was the exact opposite. The service was incredible. I felt like I was having dinner at a relatives house. I cant wait to go back. If a Cleveland fan and a Pittsburgh fan can put aside their differences and come together for good food and conversation then anything is possible."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Really small so don't take a crowd of people with you but the food was great kids menu was ok they do not have cups its cans and bottle drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Staff is great! Still have to go back and try the ice cream as I hear it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nice owner. Good food. Chili tasted GREAT, but small portion for the money. They do a good job getting each order correct. Sometimes they have a $5 Vienna beef hotdog special, with a bag of chips, and I think a soda pop,call and ask if you are not sure, the owner usually picks up the phone. They have a great variety of diet soda drinks too."}
{"text":"Randy is really nice. He forgot I wanted 2 scoops instead of one, and just gave me the other scoop for free. And the ice cream is just wonderful! Yum! Thank you for giving my Saturday a wonderful ending. 

Twilly dog is fun, good for snack. But I will try burgers next time."}
{"text":"So unique. Everything is simple but don't judge the book by its cover. Food is great. I'd say best biscuit and gravy out there. Hawaiian French toast is heaven! Owner is so sweet."}
{"text":"Very quaint, comfortable place for a quick bite to eat. Food and ice cream served all in one location.  Best of both worlds! Great selection of different types of sodas and candies.  The pulled pork baked beans were incredible!  We were immediately greeted by the owner who was very nice and accommodating.  He actually took the time to sit with us and get to know our family.  Our hamburgers were great and the value was even better.  Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"The food is so good. Great burgers, shakes and Pittsburg authentic food.  But what really makes this place great is the staff and the amazing Pittsburgh atmosphere.  Yinz need to check this place out!r"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was a great experience! Back in October we saw one of their burgers on the cover of Phoenix magazine and went to give it a try back then but the line was long and our kids were impatient so we had to take a raincheck. Tonight we showed up just as the grill was closing but the owner Randy went ahead and let us order. We got the seasoned home fries, Original Wimpy burger and the Chicken and Wild Rice soup burrito. While we sat and waited for our order to come up Randy ale over with a bowl of popcorn and sat and chatted with us. What a nice guy! Once our order was up he brought it over to us (with forks and napkins and ketchup and mustard ;) ) and then left us to enjoy our meal. Everything was superb!! Food was hot, fresh and tasty! Once we finished our meal Randy came back over to see how we liked it and then we sat and chatted some more. How many places can you go to here you actually get to meet, let alone sit and have a conversation with the owner? A great first time experience and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Owner and wife were nice & friendly. Burger was good but nothing I'm in a hurry to go back for. Potato salad tasted like the kind you buy in a big tub from Sams Club. Coleslaw was a better option. They were out of fries ... how can a burger joint be out of fries?!? The chili that comes on top of some of the meals was really good. They were also out of mac n cheese when we visited."}
{"text":"Awesome dogs and burgers and ice cream and floats and milk shakes and and and 
BANANA-PEANUT BUTTER-NUTELLA TWINKIES !!!   Are you kidding me ??   Leave your calorie counting friends at home and go have some fun :).  Owner Randy is a super nice guy and runs a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the banana split on a Saturday and had to come back Sunday morning for breakfast. EXCELLENT FOOD! Owner Randy is the nicest Corpsman I've ever met. Semper Fi!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Atmosphere was very old school and great staff. Fried bologna sandwich was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my second visit to Wimpy's Paradise. My first visit was about 6 weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon. I decided to try it based on a post I saw from a friend on Facebook.

My first visit wasn't a WOW moment. I had the open faced chili burger and there just wasn't anything special about it. I asked my wife about her burger and again it was nothing special.

Our group decided to meet there last night and grab some grub. I ordered my burger around 6:45'ish (restaurant closes at 7) I ordered the half pound, grilled onion, cheeseburger. It looked AMAZING on the sandwich board outside the restaurant! 

It came out to me about 7:15 and it was the 1/3 pound cheeseburger with no grilled onions! I was bummed. I had been waiting for this AMAZING burger ALL day!

I took it in and the server asked me what was wrong. I said this isn't the 1/2 lb. burger and there are no onions. She took it back to the kitchen and about 5 minutes later, I get it back, same burger, cheese (not even melted) with a couple of SLIGHTLY grilled onions. Again, I was bummed!!

I ate the burger and it just wasn't good. This is supposed to be a 1/2 lb., FRESH ground, chuck burger. I've made fresh ground chuck burgers at home and they have all kinds of flavor.

I took my basket in and Randy (the owner) asked me how it was. I was honest and told him about my experience. He was SUPER nice and tried to give me a $5 bill as a refund but I'm pretty sure my order cost was around $9 - I told him don't worry about the cost of the meal and I ordered some Rocky Road ice cream for dessert and of course, he wouldn't let me pay for it.

So, bottom line, Randy is the nicest guy you will EVER meet. AND, he's a Pittsburgh Steelers fan to boot but his burgers (in my experience) will not keep this \"Wimpy\" coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place for some really good Thrifty Ice Cream.
Randy is a super nice guy, he sat down and chatted with us for a while as we enjoyed our ice cream.
The portions were very generous and the prices were definitely reasonable, there's nothing worse than getting a scoop of ice cream some where just to find out its $9. Not here.....
I will be returning for the Home-Made Chili and some Hot Dogs and Burgers.
Pretty cool little candy store within the restaurant as well...."}
{"text":"Ive been on a bit of a burger bender lately.  Today was day four of a beef-fest. 
This place has been on my list since the tower of death was graced on the cover of 'best of phoenix' a year ago (or whatever)

Finally got to give it a go... convinced a coworker to go do some takeout. 
(This review is only based on food brought to me. Haven't ever been inside the place)

Ordered a double cheese with bacon and a fried egg. Third pound patties not half. 
Also a side of fries. 
First off, fries = bleh.  I don't like potatoes cut or cooked like that. Ok it's my personal thing. If I'm eating a burger I want longcut fried fries.  Not cowboy style breakfast potatoes.  Whatever. 

On to the burger.  Holy crap. Glad I didn't go half pound patties!!  This burger was serious.  I ditched the \"healthy crap\" and pulled off the lettuce tomatoe onion and pickles.   
Meats and cheese and egg only.  
Solid all the way around.  Good beef even though it was cooked to medium.  
The bacon was thick and crispy.  Egg was good. 
Granted I'm eating this 20+min after it was made so it was probably better fresh. 

Its night now....It's been 8 hours since I ate that burger and I'm still full

If you want to be in a burger coma. Go straight to wimpys paradise."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The two of us showed up at 7:03pm. The front door was open and the menu board was outside on the sidewalk. We walked to the counter to place our order and a gentleman came out from the back and told us they were closed (at 7:00 apparently). Really? We were 3 minutes past 7:00 and we couldn't get a couple of burgers?  They should have closed the front door. Won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers!  My 1/3 lb burger with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and pickles was great.  The fresh grilled flavor was perfect.  Ice cream for dessert completed the meal!  My new favorite burger joint!"}
{"text":"Went in for the third time yesterday to get some biscuits and gravy.  I don't consider myself an expert on biscuits and gravy, but I can tell you that it's the best I've ever had.  Randy is awesome as are all the people that work there, and the food is on point.  Have to support a small business like this one."}
{"text":"A second location owned by randy! Customer service and good food will always always Always get 5 stars from me. If I can feel completely welcome and at ease and enjoy the food at a establishment it is easy for me to give 5 stars. It is so hard to come by amazing customer service this day and age with so many negative waiters/waitresses/bartenders that I've seen in my lifetime.

I am so fortunate to have yet another place where I can go to and feel like everything will go just fine customer service wise and enjoy my food all in one trip. Randy will always greet you or his family helping out as you come through the door with open arms. If I can give more than 5 stars for that feeling I endure id give so much more. 

On to the food we go!

I ordered just  something simple a classic burger with bacon, cheese, and of course the lettuce and tomatoes(hold the onions!!) and don't forget the side of cole slaw! My boyfriend on the other hand went the opposite route slightly and got a chili burger can't remember the name :( but good god was it delicious. I found myself after maybe 75% through with my burger to be slowing down to consume more but at the same time I couldn't help but to cut the remaining of my burger in smaller bite-size pieces and dip them into my boyfriends chili and consume burger and his chili combined. What a glorious glorious match. If you know Randy's chili like I do and his new burgers it's a match made in heaven!  Also let me just say as UN-American as I happen to be(growing up mostly with Filipinos) there happens to be plenty of American things I do not enjoy like cold sandwiches, potato salad, baked beans, etc etc etc. With that said, Randy's daughter introduced a sample of his baked beans that the spiced up to me regardless of my lack of interest in  baked beans in which I'm so happy she did. Now if I could get that sample size every time that would be perfect with my burger and chili I can definitely do since their baked beans are the only kind I can stomach and enjoy. I just can't do as much as most other people. 

With the glass soda products coming to this establishment as well makes this even more exciting since I love the glass bottle taste compared to the plastic bottles and aluminum cans. 

Oh randy you have done it again! 
Cannot wait to see the new Pittsburgh Willys  when it opens up!"}
{"text":"First time coming here, read the reviews, a lot of positives. So we gave it a try, I ordered the big duke burger and some home fries,  my wife ordered whimpys 1/3 pd burger and banana split. Wasn't that bad at all, Randy the owner was a good guy. He let us know that they serve breakfast on Sunday's only, I will probably give it a shot."}
{"text":"My favorite fun place to go for a delicious,  unbelievably juicy burger!  Potato salad that's just the right combination of sweet and savory, and brings me back to fond memories of mom's summertime picnic cooking. PLUS... the pulled pork beans with exactly the right mix of tender pork in sweet and spicy beans!  I think when God has a hankering for the best burgers,  he (or she) just has to visit downtown Chandler and pop into Wimpy's Paradise!"}
{"text":"Despite being Steelers fans, these guys are pretty cool. I got there just before closing and they turned the grill back on for me. The open faced \"dirty burger\" is amazing. I'll definitely be back with my bride. Refreshing and affordable in the middle of a pretentious and expensive neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time in this cozy little spot. Great midwestern/steel belt/WORKING class food at great prices. I've only seen comparable prices at American Legion and VFW Posts. 
Owner noticed I was wearing my chef coat and we proceeded to talk about the style of food from our area of the country. Three Pittsburgh specific style sliders for 5.50 were delicious and better than many restaurants in DC. I'm going to be back. True hospitality and good food at its best. Some other restaurants could learn so much."}
{"text":"Great food - tastes homemade. The owner, Randy, is the absolute greatest man. He's a dutiful owner, cook, and host. He's got a great memory for customers and I've always felt welcome.  I've told everyone I know how great this place is, and feel good giving him my business. Viva la Wimpy's!"}
{"text":"Have you ever witnessed something so brilliant that the only thing  you could do was stop and take a moment to appreciate the scope of its awesomeness?

This happened after my first bite of the burger here at Wimpy's Paradise. The flavor! The texture! The toppings on my burger!

It has been a LONG time (maybe forever) that i've experienced so much flavor from a burger patty. If you are a fan of burgers you MUST try this place!

I will be coming back. If you drop in, tell Randy (the awesome owner) that the nice one sent you!"}
{"text":"Crowd pleaser!  Brought the whole family--Grandparents, cool Aunt, little ones--and there was something for everyone!  The burgers, dogs, & ice cream were all delicious!  The owner might be the nicest guy on the planet."}
{"text":"Wimpy's was a little different than I imagined when I walked in. Small quaint and quirky. The guy in there was super nice and had my made to order burger up fast. It was big and juicy and the bacon is thick and delicious. With cheese and grilled onions it was all very delicious. I wish they had mayo but I was able to doll it up when I got back with it... Excellent burger though!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write this review as I found getting take out from this establishment as a complete waste of money. The order was a cheeseburger and Reuben. They charge a dollar extra for having cheese, but no where does it say that. The Reuben tasted like spam, had a weird texture, and was not at all like real corned beef.  The hamburger bun was soggy even though the ketchup was missing. Lastly, you only get a tiny 2oz side of potato salad per item, but they only included one."}
{"text":"Wimpy's is amazing! Not only is it a cute little hole in the wall but the food is great without breaking your wallet and the owner is a hands on, nice man. I'm from Indiana and I know good biscuits n gravy. By far the best biscuits n gravy I've ever had. Family included. I got the Ultimate dirty burger (beef patty with cheese, topped with chili and crispy onions). My SO got the build your own burger with potato salad and biscuits n gravy on the side. We are so happy to find a cute lil joint like this place. We will be returning. Go check out Wimpy's!"}
{"text":"Tonight, I went into Wimpy's craving a couple of burgers. I realized as soon as I walked in there was 10 minutes until close and didn't want to be rude and have a burger made last minute. Randy was more than willing to serve up until- and past close. The second burger was for my boyfriend who has been sick at home the last couple days, Randy left us a get well message! So sweet.

(I couldn't refrain from taking a bite before I took the picture.)

This is a business that I will support any day of the week. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and wonderful, caring customer service unlike any place I've been in AZ. Thanks, Randy!"}
{"text":"Randy is fabulous! We saw this place on the news and decided to check it out. Great food, great price, awesome service, and a fun atmosphere. We'll definitely be back. And thanks for making us feel so welcomed, totally earned 5 stars!"}
{"text":"They are only open for breakfast on Sundays. We went for breakfast.

My wife had biscuit and gravy and I had the breakfast burrito. It's called something else but I can't remember the name.

Both were excellent! Price was fair and staff was friendly.

My only complaint is no unsweet iced tea.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this little place and everything about it. Delicious food and at great prices! It's whimsical and fun and you're treated like a friend, not just a customer. Looking forward to getting back there soon for a big ole sundae.  Randy's passion for yummy, tummy tickling food and second to none customer service shows through here!  My only request is this.....Can you get bigger bags of chips, please?  :o) May I suggest Poore Brothers?"}
{"text":"Great customer service and yummy food at this small family owned business. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot, very nostalgic. Love the name, love the decor. The menu is simple, the food is delicious, and owner is nice. Then you have the old school barbershop next door. Like I said, very nostalgic. Great job."}
{"text":"Finally found the best burger in town. Just moved to Chandler and thought a good burger was not to be found.   Had the 1/2 wimpy burger with ex cheese and everything.  The meat is incredible.  It's one epic burger.  Omg Randy was talking with us all outside and have to say he is one awesome guy.  Buddy had the Big willy Mac and chili dog.  Huge and had to try it out. Wow that was great.   randy made us try a Original Twilly Dog.  It's a hotdog and uses a twinky as the bun top with bacon and creamy peanut butter. I thought the same thing \"that disgusting and no way I would eat that\".  You have to try it.  It was so good.  After me and the wife are it Randy came over and took a picture of us eating it and put up on the Twilly Dog page.  Honestly it is next to San Tan brewery and think everyone goes there. But if you want great food from a great guy, take it from a fatty and pass up all those places and you have to try Wimpys. Already making plans for another outing."}
{"text":"I try not to give a 5 star rating but this place deserves it. I had an original Wimpy's Burger and a chocolate shake...spot on. Service was fast and friendly and the \"vibe\" was great. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Place was also clean and unrefined. Big words."}
{"text":"I just want to start off my saying service is so good here and I regretfully didn't write down or store the gentleman's name in my attractive brain. But, back to. The gentleman up front , great personality , great showmen and just a overall nice guy. Not only gave us popcorn as  we waited but entertained us with great humor and showed us some beautiful burger pics. 

Now the food, mmmm if you like flavor of chili, if you like meat in the form of burgers/hot dogs . prepare your mouth cause this place is great. 

Cost: beautiful , I got chili cheese hotdog , dirty burger ,Mac cheese burger and homemade fries for like 23 bucks .

Size : so much food, ate at like 4 didn't eat the rest of the day. 

Taste: These guys know how to cook whats on the menu so much flavor. Put away the mustard and ketchup , you won't need to add anything else to what they have put together for you 

Overall: This place , is a repeat visit , for every customer ."}
{"text":"This is a little mom and pops place and it's awesome! I have no prob driving over 30 min to grab a bite here. The food is soooooooo good that I was eating and literally looking forward to coming back before even finishing my meal. Been here 3x now and each time the service and food were both amazing. I got the homemade chicken \"healing soup\" the first time and my husband got the \"dirty burger\". Both our meals were so good. And the crazy part is that they're affordable!!! Our party of 6 can eat for under $55, including drinks. That's unheard of! I have opted for the dirty burger the next two times I went because when I tasted my husbands and was in love. It's a delicious hamburger smothered in chili. I asked the owner what kind of beef they use because I could taste that it wasn't cheap ground beef. He told me they use angus beef from Nebraska. No wonder it tasted soooooooo good! You can taste the quality ingredients they use, plus the care that goes into their recipes. The place is tiny, but quite adorable. Will be grabbing lunch there whenever I'm in the area and even when I'm not in the area I'll make the trip to go regularly. Highly recommend!!! I also love that it's family owned and the owners are right there working, cooking, greeting customers, thanking you for coming in, etc. I will definitely continue supporting this local business. They deserve it and their food makes it impose to stay away."}
{"text":"Got the 1/3lb Bacon Burger and it was HUGE!!! Loved every bite of it! Definitely going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Walking down the street looking for a breakfast place on a sunday morning and happen across a sidewalk sign that says - everyone of all beliefs are welcome. If you are not hungry come in and get a hug.

Honey, we're going in....

Quickly, after sitting down a cheerful young woman waited on us. 

I ordered the big green chili burrito and my
Esposa (see what i did there to emphasize the Latino influence) ordered the banana french toast. 

While waiting for our food we asked each other trivial pursuit questions from the cards on the table. The coffee is strong and tasty. 

The food was served quickly on a paper plate with plastic cutlery. Don't let the informal setting fool you. The food was excellent. Once i gobbled down my burrito I made the excess french toast my wife left behind go away.

After paying our very reasonable check i asked for and received a hug from Randy the owner. Hey, get over it, I'm secure in my sexuality.

So yah, I like the place and I think you will too."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time a couple weeks ago. My daughter loved the bologna sammich and the rest of us had tasty burgers. Service was great. My daughter has been asking to go back so we plan to get back over there soon!  It's kinda funny because when we first walked in she didn't think she was gonna like it. After one visit, now she's hooked!"}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING. These guys went out of their way and made our Mommy/Son date day special. We had such a great time. This place has lots of atmosphere. I was a little unimpressed with the food but I really can't complain. The price was good and the service rocked."}
{"text":"Great family time tonight at Wimpy's! We played records!! Real records on a record player and loved the burgers, hot dogs and wild rice burrito. Michael eating the Twinkie hot dog with bacon and peanut butter  thank you Randy. You are a Gem in the desert! Jon Melby was right about you. You are all heart."}
{"text":"I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today, especially if it's from Wimpy's! This shop is tiny, especially considering the amount of space that neighbors such as San Tan Brewery occupy, but that just adds to its charm. Right when I stood in front of the restaurant I knew this was my place when I saw the Black Knight from Monty Python guarding the entrance. :) The decor is nostalgic, a nod to the days when Popeye and Wimpy were popular and Saturday Evening Post was a household staple. I read a bit about the history of this little shop and it turns out the owner Randy wanted to carry out his father's original restaurant legacy (His father owned two Wimpy's restaurants back in the 30s-40s but had to shut them down when he left to fight for our country in WWII). So, he opened up this restaurant in his memory. 

The menu consists of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs. Drinks are by the bottle or can. I had the quarter pound burger special advertised outside the door, adding pepper jack and green chiles. I also tried some of the Reuben sandwich.

The burger was excellent. The bun was lightly toasted and the hand formed patty was tender, juicy, and well seasoned. The pepper jack and green chiles were great and provided a little spicy kick to the meal. I didn't realize that the burger deal was supposed to come with chips in addition to my soda until after I looked at a photo of the specials board; the lack of chips was unfortunate because I was still hungry after eating the burger. I tried a bite of the Reuben which was basic but the meat had a lot of flavor in it. My friend had a dirty burger which was a heaping mountain of chili and French fried onions on top of his burger. Next time I'm feeling particularly gluttonous I will get this burger!

There aren't a lot of tables in the restaurant and it closes early so get here early to indulge in a delicious meal. 

The owner is really friendly and nice. Overall, a good experience. It would certainly be a place Wimpy would consider paradise!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and amazing service! Only bad thing was they were out of fries and I don't enjoy drinking soda from a can at restaurants. Every time an employee walked by they asked if they could get is anything. The burgers were very well seasoned! Will be going back."}
{"text":"Q: Why did the banana go out with the prune? A: Because he couldn't find a date. 

My family and I enjoyed banana splits, malts and a waffle cone after a filling breakfast at San Tan brewery nextdoor early on a Sunday morning. Nothing is better than checking in and receiving a deal to use so we had to use it! The place was steady but not overwhelming, the checkout is awkwardly located right next to a dining table that puts you into personal places of diners. 
My 3 stars is based on this: 
The Checkout woman rudely grabbed my phone from me when I mentioned I had a 25% off $10. Never asked to have my phone- literally grabs it. 
She then, sets my phone down on the counter instead of handing it back after she rudely grabbed it. Her energy was poisonous so we sat outside and felt like she didn't want to serve us.
Her husband saves the day and continues the service after that and is why the stars went from 2 to 3. 

The location is in the heart of downtown chandler."}
{"text":"The Twinkie hot dog (twillie) is really good, the hamburgers taste like homemade backyard BBQ style. The only thing that bothered me is the cleanliness/appearance of the store and the cook. If you can fix that, it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"WOW!  Awesome experience we had here at Pittsburgh Willy's / Wimpy's Paradise.   The food was great, the service was fabulous, and despite being a small location, it was quite comfortable!  Oh...and the shakes and various ice cream flavors - YUMMY!  I can say with confidence that my family of five wouldn't hesitate to return.  To satisfy all three kids and both parents is quite the accomplishment and they've achieved that!  Congratulations Wimpy's!  We'll see you next time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing to say the least. First off they were out of fries on a Saturday at lunch time second they were out of pretzel buns and to top it off the potato salad had enough salt on it to choke choke a horse plus the potatoes were rotten!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!  Burger was great, shakes were awesome. The guys there were so nice. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great place! Went twice and both times were amazing. Great service and amazing food. I will be going back, recommending, and taking family that visits."}
{"text":"Little small place with big tasting food!!!!  Good for lunch and dessert!!! Wide variety of burgers and hot dogs. 

Roaming the square just happened to stumble on this place. I am glad I did!!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have ever had. Hands down. The owner Randy is an amazing guy, and gives back to the community and supports police and armed forces. Not only do you get the best burger ever but the service is outstanding. Thanks for all you do Randy, and thanks for letting me in even though I am a Packer fan! 
Pro tip: Ask for the Jaron Brown Burger. It's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I like this place - it is such a cute idea. Vintage is in and always will be. The candy shop inside is a sweet idea to take me back to...nevermind I'm not old enough but I absolutely love looking at the throwback designs :) My husband is a fan of the burger and I like myself a dessert or two! All around tasty. Nice downtown location too!"}
{"text":"All the food is great, desserts are awesome, service is amazing, and the area is wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best burger I have had in Arizona.  I had the third pound with Dubliner cheese and grilled onions on a brioche bun.  Exceptional!  The fries are like seasoned home fries, not French fries, which wasn't what I was expecting, but they were also very good. I saw they had a lot of the toppings for hot dogs too, which I want to order except the I won't have room for a hamburger.  I think they were going to opens a new location, and I hope that can happen, because a bigger, more comfortable dining room would be the only thing missing from this experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly staff and atmosphere was cozy.  Burgers were incredible and the Chicago Vienna Hot Dogs complete with celery salt were a great taste of home.  Shakes were tasty but we couldn't leave without having a cone too!  Definitely worth a revisit.... Yum yum!"}
{"text":"I never knew a fried bologna & egg sandwich could taste so good. They also have the best sausage gravy & biscuits."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh beef, burger was great, well cooked and covered in chili. The topper was the home fries, almost as good as my own!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were first time customers.  We were greeted by Randy as soon as we walked in and he sat down with us and told us a little about the menu.  After taking our order he continued to visit with us and made us feel so welcome.  Our burgers were delicious!  Will definitely go back to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Pittsburgher managed and owned ... great service and food with a friendly Pittsburgh hometown style. Wimpy hamburgers and Pittsburgh Willy hotdogs are tasty... Randy does a great job in making your experience a comfortable one with quality food. A pleasant place for a quick bit in old town Chandler Az. One of a kind...   :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great, honest food served with a smile.  This is place and the owner are 100% authentic and real.  No fillers, no gimmicks and no fake fro fro.  Just good food and cozy atmosphere that takes you back to a time when \"Gluten Free\" did not exist, and Hostess Twinkies reigned supreme.  
So, fill up that tank with leaded fuel, and mosey down to Downtown Chandler for a good meal!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch after seeing their sign stating how they have the best burgers this side of Pittsburgh and the best hot dogs anywhere.  My boyfriend and I ordered the 1/3 lb burger and a chili cheese dog. The burger tasted like it was a frozen patty from Costco and it was very, very dry.  I can not stress enough how dry the burger was. There are no fries offered, so went with the chips. The chips you get yourself out of a bag, they are not made there.  The chili cheese dog was also a disappointment. The chili tasted like you were eating tomato paste with bits of peppers thrown in. This place just seems to heat food up, not actually cook anything.  The drinks are out of a can, chips out of a bag, etc. It is just disappointing knowing that I paid for a meal that I can make better at home. I do not understand how other reviews are stating how amazing the burgers are dogs are. Just confusing."}
{"text":"So I stopped by thus place since it's fairly new to downtown Chandler.  It takes a best theme off of the Wimpy Burger from the TV series Popeye.  

They serve two burger sizes 1/3 and 1/2 pounders. No French Fries but they do have a side of potatoes salad that comes with the burger. They do sell chips and all their drinks are cans or bottles. 

I ordered the 1/3 pound burger with cheese, the side of potato salad that comes with it and a bottle of water. All total was $9,40.

The burger was OK, nothing special as was the potato salad. For a buck more I could have a 1/2 pound burger with fries and iced tea at my local pub which serves up a mean burger. 

Nice try!"}
{"text":"Love it! Perfect cheap comfort food that goes great on a Sunday morning.

Best biscuits n gravy in AZ!"}
{"text":"Man, as soon as you walk in the door, great hospitality and feel like you've been a long time customer.. This is an old school type shop, like back in the day.  Even have a Servie Memorial wall, much props !! Thanks for you and your family's services as well Randy !!... 

This is now my Fave Burger Joint !! 
Decent menu selections and alternatives, and the place was very clean while holding the authentic aged cafe/restaurant appearance. Nice selection of Canned or bottle sodas to choose from was nice..  

Ordered a 1/3 lb Burger, with Swiss and Green Chili, side of Cole Slaw. 
Now, I can throw down a  mean burger, and grind my own beef on occasion but, Wimpy's paradise, gets there beef from the heavens,, well maybe not, but Nebraska might have something to do with it, and the flavors were OUTSTANDING, without adding anything extra, like A1, ketchup etc,, the flavor of the patty ROCKED... 

Coleslaw was also pretty good, as I usually don't finish 1 serving, but I left no scraps today !!

Kudos to Randy and staff... Will stop by more often for sure..."}
{"text":"Super cute little stop, had homemade chocolate shake super yummy and love then honoring memory to military!!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast on Sunday mornings.  Everything is made from scratch too.  Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"While one of the most friendly places I've ever been to  the comments seem to blow this place out of the water and frankly I just don't see or should I say Taste it. Burger was not juicy...not seasoned with any thing that I could taste. Potato salad tasted like it was from Fry's deli...not that that's a bad thing...just not home made. Soda selection seems to be the highlight of the meals. It looks like they went to the Soda Pop Shop in Scottsdale To Stock Up On Some Creative Fare. 
Oh and their candy store collection is great. ..straight from Sweeties. Neat selection! 
But the Burger was huge and Boring. Same with my husband's Naked chilli cheese dog and a lot more to do. 
Overall I am not sure if we we try them again
Service is perfect.  Decor is perfect for the style.  But food is unremarkable. Not bad at all just average."}
{"text":"Were to start....I have been coming to Wimpy's since it was located in the antique mall in chandler many years ago! Gourmet burgers and signature hotdogs are only the beginning of the story of my relationship with not just the magnificent food but more importantly the incredible family that owns and runs Wimpy's . The incredible food cooked to order is but one reason to visit but I think the treasure of the establishment is the man behind Wimpy's Randy....Randy makes you feel like your eating at home in your mothers kitchen, lots of love and stories and catching up and it continues with every customer or even the people walking by the business. Good old fashioned home cooking makes an impression but treating you like family makes you yearn for more! Best secret about Wimpy's is the Sunday's only breakfast......incredible...."}
{"text":"Without a doubt my go to place for some great hotdogs with all the fixings. Try the Bologna sandwich with egg. My favorite is the, well the, no maybe the. Geez try it all."}
{"text":"Based on reviews tried this place couple  weeks ago  for breakfast?..Pancakes took over 40 minutes for just 2 pancakes, flat and like a rock, not airy and fluffy,  Bisquits and gravy were ok, coffee excellent. Was told they ran out of pancake batter..on a Sunday, when we were only the fourth table at like 930 and wasn't told this till waiting very long and wondering why so long for 2 plain pancakes?  Didn't enjoy eating with paper plates, plastic utensils..like a truck stop ...Cute place, nostalgic memories, not enough to have me go back.. just not for us ..They need a bigger kitchen area to get the food out faster ..Not have to wait over an hour to eat 3 easy items that could have been cooked quickly.. I do not come to have conversations to eat up the time waiting for food .... I come to eat with my family LOL..Everyone is very nice there and tried to accommodate? and explain why so long a wait for food . Not a fan ..Happy for those who are :-)"}
{"text":"Cute place!  I just had a hot dog, but it was good. It is a small restaurant, but it fits in nicely with the downtown Chandler vibe. I would like to come back to try more things. 
They had a cute sign outside about no pumpkin spice anything was served there. ."}
{"text":"Great little tiny place for some unique burgers and dogs. Stop and check it out. The owner does all the cooking and is super friendly"}
{"text":"The owner of this establishment is really what this great review is about. My wife and I participate in the monthly craft show in downtown chandler. On several occasions we have observed how friendly and genuine the owners are. We watch them warmly greet every customer and do their best to ensure everyone that enters their establishment get 5 star service. My experience when eating here was no different. It is truly rare to see a owner take pride in their restaurant as they do here."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch! Always enjoy coming here for a family lunch on the weekends, every employee is nice and helpful here. I have never had a problem with this establishment on any occasion in the past."}
{"text":"Gave this place a couple chances, and we really want to like it but we just don't understand what's so yummy about it.

I've had a burger, the Pittsburgher dog, and some biscuits and gravy the couple times I've been here and everything was good. Except the burger we had was really dry and tasteless unless you load it up with a bunch of toppings. I do like that they have other cheeses for your burgers, the service is amazingly friendly and makes you feel at home. Great atmosphere with a little candy bar that's perfect for the little ones if they eat all there food! 

I really like everything, but wish the food was a bit better. Especially for the prices. Nothing to write home about and honestly won't be back for the food, but definitely for the free hugs!"}
{"text":"Great burger nice mix of Angus and Chuck with excellent seasoning. ..slaw was good..I'll try the Potatoe salad next time. .even a can of vernors.  Nice murals on the walls.."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! Quality meat and delicious fries! You don't need all that swill on your burger!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday breakfast spot!  Tried the biscuits and gravy this morning, excellent sausage gravy. Our favorite must have is the fried egg and fried bologna sandwich, you should definitely give it a try! Friendly staff and clean, quaint restaurant with the feel of an old time mom and pop soda shop."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has gotten such great reviews because my experiences haven't been all that great. The first time I went I asked for three different things and they said they wee out of all of them! Second time I got some burgers to go and the flavor was really just so so kind of boring to be honest. Potato salad was super mayo-ey plus they overcharged me for chips and instead of giving me my money back told me they just included the potato salad in which I didn't even want. Not sure I'll return there's a million better burgers I would rather have for the same price or even less."}
{"text":"Omg I work at crust down the street N my boss told me about this burger joint down the street ,man was it amazing, perfectly juicy and flavorful.  Great service as well most definitely will be coming on my lunch breaks here"}
{"text":"When was the last time you go to a local restaurant and was personality greeted by the owner? When was the last time the owner shoke your hand asking you for your name and open the door for you on your way out? Wimply is it! This is a family owned restaurant and the server of this lovely morning is the owner's wife and the daughter. 

I have visited just about all restaurants in downtown Chandler and unfortunately did not even notice this one until now. Since we love biscuits and gravy, we've decided to come here and give it a try this Sunday morning. I ordered the French toast with slices of bananas and a side of egg. The French toast is thick and fluffy. However, the syrup was a bit too sweet for my taste. It would be nice if there's different choices in flavor or less sweeten. Overall, I still think that it was delicious and worth trying. I also took a bite of the biscuits and gravy dish (only served on Sunday morning) - it was ABSOLUTELY heavenly. It is not salty like other places I've been to and the biscuits were so soft that it melts in your mouth. I will definitely order that again on our next visit (and not sharing next time). 

Food are served on paper plates, plastic bowls, folks and knives. It doesn't bother me at all as long as the food is good. The restaurant has approximately 10 tables or so. If you have a huge party coming over (over 4 people), just be aware of the size of this place and might want to call ahead of time. Apparently, this establishment is also known for their burgers and hot dogs (and was featured in local magazines). The owner, Randy, showed us the magazine while we were waiting for our food. He said to us: \"this is not a fancy restaurant, but I'm proud to be on the magazine as a moms and pops shop owner\". You should have seen the proud look on his face. He makes me want to reach over and gave him a big hug. 

I love supporting local restaurants that is not a chain or franchise. I'll definitely come back here again with friends to try them out again. I highly recommend this place to my fellow yelpers."}
