{"text":"Please avoid this place.  Aside from the horrible serve, you get charged $4.99 for a 3 (three ounce) beef patty.  What a horrible value.  Steer clear and eat at home or wait until you can get out of the airport."}
{"text":"The burger had a really nice char-grilled flavor which I guess is what u should expect. Fries were good also. 

Took a star off because the old guy behind the counter was pretty rude."}
{"text":"I've tried. Tried to give Char-Grill a fighting chance on many occasions, but every time I am utterly disappointed and left completely unsatisfied. 

What they do to the American cheeseburger should be considered blasphemy. Their \"milkshakes\" are a quite a misnomer (ice cream with a straw). Not to mention my two year old sons balls have already dropped in the amount of time since we've been waiting for our food."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try with my family this afternoon ,  we were all craving a fast , convenient , delicious hamburger place. This was definitely the place to go , the burgers tasted great , exactly the same as Five Guys , minus the huge mess. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Slow, sloppy, service. Mediocre food. Rough after a long day of travel while trying to catch a plane."}
{"text":"A delicious burger, better than cookout and comparable to Five Guys. My husband and I ate for less than fifteen dollars and had a milkshake! If you're looking for a good quality burger joint with fries and vinegar--- this is your place. We will return for the \"junior combo\" on a non-traditional sesame bun. Service was excellent, with the leadership present and attentive."}
{"text":"Just the basics but done really well!!"}
{"text":"I got a combo for $13. Fries were hot. Burger was cold and sloppy. Was defently not worth the price. Main reason people buy because they are hungry and no other options for hamburgers."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Jr.\" Combo.

They cook it right in front of you behind the glass. The person who takes your order puts ice in your cup, but the drink portion is self -serve. Strange. Burger was cooked in about 7 minutes. Fries were hot out of the fryer. Their style is almost like burger subs, meaning these aren't round sandwiches. 

Other reviews compared this place to Five Guys or Cook Out. I'd say it's slightly above Cook Out and well below Five Guys in terms of meat quality. The meat is just...bland. Nothing really sets it off and mine was somewhat dry.

Staff was friendly and location was clean."}
{"text":"This is similar to Five Guys but with more choices. I stop in when I need something quick, and know the quality is always going to be the same. The food is cooked to order, and is always extremely hot (which is good) great place if you want simple food, cooked quickly."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger. Fries were good too. Spotless restaurant, very convent location"}
{"text":"Worst burger ever.  They call it hamburger steak, but there isn't even fake beef flavor.  It tastes like cardboard.  Stale cardboard!

To be fair, the fries were very good.  But $14.50 for the burger, fries, sweet tea combo, it was a learning experience.  Apparently a popular chain in the Carolinas, I can only hope this was awful because it was their airport (gate a) version.   But I'd never try it again."}
{"text":"Going to the Char-Grill took me back to Raleigh in 1967. It was great then and now it's great in Davidson. The Char-Burger was delicious. The only thing that I missed was sitting on the picnic table and tossing fries to the birds."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and slow, customers who ordered 10 minutes before me received their food first. Burgers were no better than Mcdonald's, fries were not fresh cut. My order came out wrong and took 10 minutes to fix."}
{"text":"This was a refreshing find compared to other airport options.  Burgers, fries and beer, without leaving me asking \"Where's the beef?\"  

A little pricey for a Char-Grill, but that's expected at any airport.  3 of us ate for under $40 total (there's beer in that price), and the meals were decent."}
{"text":"Having a meal in the airport always stinks.  The food always tastes like it was microwaved in the back, and the prices are always crazy high.  This was not the case at Char-grill. 

The grill the burgers right in front of you.  They are nothing fancy, but I can totally dig a freshly grilled hamburger in the airport.  The prices were reasonable as well.  My wife and I had lunch for under $20.  This is unheard of in airports too.  

I would definitely go back, and I hope they put one in more airports!"}
{"text":"The burger was great, the prices, holy cow $13 for a combo. I just wrote a review on another place in Davidson, and the prices were high. I think that I may be getting old, and feel prices should be lower. 

I don't know, is it just me, or is $13 for a burger combo really expensive?"}
{"text":"Disappointing, fast food burger and fries.  Sticky tables, won't go back.  Wendy's would have been better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The food is consistently good. The service is good and usually quick unless they are busy. The access is really easy I usually park on the street and am in and out in no time. This is one of my favorites places to stop in and get a burger."}
{"text":"Our hamburgers were delicious! The restaurant was very clean and the staff were cheerful and neat. Our whole family loved everything we had to eat here. Kids really liked how they cooked right in front of you. Nice upscale feel to this whole area. We were impressed and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wanted to really like this place.  It is nice and clean.  But the fact is, this place doesn't measure up to 5 Guys.  

The burgers are decent size, but they just don't taste nearly as good.  They're just too dry and the meat isn't flavorful.  I've tried to load up on various toppings, but it always comes back to the meat which just isn't that good.

They do have pretty good shakes and their fries are solid. All in all this is a perfect fit for a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"These guys are horrible. No concept of fast service. Took 15 mins to get a basic cheeseburger combo meal while the place was practically empty and the two team members stood around looking thoroughly disinterested. Food was average at best. I went here thinking it would be faster than some of the better options in terminal 1. Don't be fooled, these guys are slower than the other options that are much better. Plenty of better choices in terminal 1."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is fantastic!  
Clean and spacious establishment...and the food...oh my!
So far, I've had the 1/4 Hamburger Steak Jr. - which is PLENTY! Love the way it's cooked & it's shaped like a sub sandwich. So tasty! I've also had the hot dog...YAY for red bright leaf hot dogs! They're a staple in the eastern part of the state. Fries are good too; cooked perfectly.
Employees are super friendly too!
What's neat too, is the ability to watch them cook & prepare your food on spot. They have windows into the cooking area.
Fast service, too.
YUUUUM!"}
{"text":"Being from Raleigh home of the original Char-Grill I was stoked that we were getting a Char-grill in Charlotte (well Davidson but its a short drive)  This place is awesome if you want the best burger in town then check out Char-Grill everything is made to order the burgers are fresh - no frozen patties here.  You are definitely going to want to order a milkshake to wash down that burger.  The service is outstanding the staff is friendly, the food comes out fast, and you will leave with a happy belly."}
{"text":"Like other reviews, quite simply bland and tasteless. And dry....so very dry. Can't ever imagine that McDonalds would have better burgers BUT they do. Hunger is the only reasons I finished. Keep your drink in your other hand while you eat cause you have to drink after every dry bite."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Burgers were average. Don't get me wrong they were good but nothing special. and the staff is not focused on customer service. The outside seating is not clean, with trash laying on the floor and not up kept."}
{"text":"Good ole greasy busted your calories count in one sitting type of joint. I ordered the steak burger with mayo, grilled onions, lettuce and tomatoes. It was soo good. My son begged me to have some just by looking at it.. it's nicely cook, not well done. Maybe medium well done for a burger. And I don't mind it.. still very juicy.. Fries were also very good.. However, 
Their chicken tenders wasn't a hit. Tastes like they brought it in pre frozen and just heat it up in the microwave. My son didn't like it.. instead he stare my burger down! I didn't care for the coleslaw either. Very very watery.. so I didn't finish.. overall service was very good. Nice to see how they cook your burger.. want to go back to taste their milkshakes and their apple pies. I love fried apple pies!"}
{"text":"I imagine this place stays in business because is convenient for students and parents, since the schools are directly across the street. However, the presentation and delivery is very poor. 

We ate at the tables outside, so I expected trays, instead we got A bag. Individual bagS would have been perfect, because we could have used them to eat on. But they chose to THROW our whole order into one (small) bag! We had three orders! 2 veggie burgers, chicken strips and 3 orders of fries. And when I say throw, I mean throw....The chicken strips were on the bottom of the bag, the fries were not in a container- all 3 orders just dumped on top of the chicken strips- and the 2 burgers sat on top! We had to dig through the fries (which were not good), to get to the chicken strips... who does that??

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars, is because the veggie burgers were half-way decent (with the limited toppings offered).... or was I just hungry??

With the number of burger places around today, Char burger needs to start paying attention to the details that make a difference."}
{"text":"The best way I can explain this place is \"OK\".  Clean, nice spot for an inexpensive lunch.  I like that you can see all the action going on in the back.  The ingredients seemed fresh.  I had the 1/4lb burger with chili.  I try not to eat burgers that often, but when I do, I want a flavorful juicy experience.  It just wasn't there with this burger.  The fries were just OK as well.  It was cheap and better than Cook Out or Burger King, but I would spend the couple extra dollars and go to Five Guys next time I'm calorie loading for the winter."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Char-Grill--and the place lived up to expectations. The hamburger steak was perfectly cooked and just the right size. The toppings were fresh. The fries were wonderfully crispy outside and soft and potatoey inside. Nothing special about the digs--but that doesn't matter because we were there for the food. Pretty fast even though it's not exactly fast food. I'd put Char-Grill in a class with Five Guys."}
{"text":"This is turning out to be my go-to place for Breakfast when I fly Southwest.  It isn't bad, and the meal will hold you over for a few hours flight and maybe even help you get some sleep from the carb overload.  Attached to it is a Mexican food place, so there really isn't a lot of other options."}
{"text":"My experience was poor. Despite a menu consisting of burgers and fries, the service was excessively slow. There were perhaps 4 or 5 customers ahead of me in line, but order taking was not the problem. It was fulfilling the orders. What should have been a 5 minute wait turned into 25. They never made my milkshake so when I asked about it, the machine wasn't working correctly. I had to leave to catch my flight so I paid for something I never received. The attitude of the workers at the service window was very non-caring. There were numerous instances where they would announce a ticket was ready and when the customers tried to ask questions the staff just turned around and disappeared without acknowledging the guest. When I did get my sandwich and fries, they were just so-so. I can't imagine the judges who deemed Char-Grill \"North Carolina's Best Burger Joint\" visited this location. I won't be returning. Ever."}
{"text":"Great Tasting Burger, the way it used to be

OK,  I'm not PC but this is a great burger and a throwback to my younger days when taste was more important that anything else.

Flame broiled burger are not good for you because of the formation of nitrosamines. But they taste great.

These burgers taste great and are a throwback to my day's in the '50's watching my father struggle with a charcoal grill and getting the ole style charcoal briquettes to light despite enough lighter flue to power a 747.  Lot of effort, lot of love but in the end, a burger that tasted like an act of love.

That is what you get here.

Great taste. Not overcooked and nice an moist and you can taste the flavor of the meat. The requested topping and condiments are in perfect balance and each is as freah as it can be.

When you pick up your burger, the size of it is a bit disappointing compared to the hugh offerings from the major chains.  Bit into you order and you will be very well pleased.  While not as overwhelming, the taste compared to the nationals is without compare. 

I scored a winner last weekend but it was not the first time nor will it be the last."}
{"text":"I was in Davidson for a workshop and walked over to here. I live in Durham, which also has a Char Grill, but had never been. I wasn't in the mood for a burger, so I got Garden Salad with chicken tenders on it. Salad was decent, about what you would expect at a fast food joint. Came with Ken's Steakhouse dressing (ranch). I would have liked something a little more interesting than just iceberg lettuce and pale tomatoes, but the chicken was good. Fries were just okay, not super tasty. Great location; I enjoyed sitting at the bar overlooking the street."}
{"text":"First off, let me say I believe Five Guys has ruined me for any other burger place.

I didn't like Char-Grill, I felt the burger was dry, even after I had chili put on mine and the fries were just ok.  I think I could have got the same thing at a fast food place for .99 cents.  I probably won't go back, unless someone else suggests it... maybe."}
{"text":"This is the cutest eatery here at the airport but it is so filthy you won't want to sit here to eat. The food turned out to be tasty.  RDU is a very quiet airport which must be why the cook to order.  It takes a while but the chicken breast was well cooked and juicy and the fries were fresh.  The hot dog was a weird shade of pink that we've never seen before, but it tasted fine.  I recommend ordering here is you have the time, but take your food to go."}
{"text":"This an ok place but order my burger tonight and paid for cheese and can you tell me how you can forget cheese when the ticket is in your sight at all times"}
{"text":"I hate it when I eat in at an establishment and they make it to go. Like 5 guys. I don't care how good it looks or tastes, that's just tacky."}
{"text":"Holy Price Hike!!!!
Wow!!! they have really raised prices on their food!!!! I stopped by recently and got the steak combo- it is now $13 and change versus $10 and change it originally was. The combo at the Char-grills outside of the airport is roughly $7.00. The 8 oz \"Steak\" hamburger with cheese by itself is now $8.00 and fries are $2.90!!!!????. I can't justify or recommend a $13 hamburger, fries, and  medium drink even though it is good; it is not that good. The food quality is still 4 stars, however I am downgrading to 2 stars for value and because at the current prices I won't eat there and get gouged again.  I know it is airport food and you expect to pay more than outside, not almost 100% more. Sorry guys, the food product is very good, however for that price I can go down the concourse, add $2 and get a much better meal."}
{"text":"MAN, is that a good burger! They give it to you in a bag and you know it's good by the amount of grease at the bottom :P 

I didn't want my last bite to be over! I'll have to go back and try other menu items, but they sure make a mean bacon cheeseburger and fries."}
{"text":"I have been working in Davidson all week and drove past this place every morning vowing to try it out one day for lunch, finally I did, I just wish I didn't build it up in my mind so much.  Don't get me wrong the food was pretty good, I even liked the long hoagie bun for the burger, reminiscent of BK chicken sandwich bun, but it was nothing overly impressive.  If it didn't have the name written anywhere inside from the taste of the burger and the interior design I would have sworn I was inside a Five Guys.  Very similar in meal price to Five Guys as well.  Didn't get the fries from the reviews didn't seem as though I was missing anything, and honestly from the look of my neighbors golden fried Gators they looked good but nothing spectacular.   Having said that last statement that pretty much sums up the Char-Grill experience.  Good place, good food, I'd go back in a heart beat.... but nothing exceptional"}
{"text":"You know how occasionally you find a great restaurant, and you feel obligated to tell everyone you know about it?

Well, I've been doing that for the entirety of this place's existence.  My friends surely think I have a relative working there, but I definitely don't.  I just happen to appreciate a good thing when I find it.  For years, I had been searching for something on this side of Charlotte that had that \"just grilled\" taste that I'd come to love so much with lifelong visits to Mr. K's.

Well, it doesn't get any fresher grilled than Char-Grill.  It's always a lively joint, with great 50's and 60's music playing over the loudspeaker.  My favorite is the slightly-spicy \"Carolina Red\" hot dogs.  You can search every grocery store in Charlotte, you'll never find a hot dog as good as these.  I love them!

The only real change I would encourage would be to get rid of the soft serve ice cream shakes, because they are just not meant to be drunk.  You'll suck your brain right out.  I understand it's faster that way, but people would greatly appreciate a Steak 'N Shake style *MILK*shake over a Wendy's Frosty, which is what this is.  Only the nearby Tenders restaurant is serving a drinkable milkshake, so it's kind of a missed opportunity.

Davidson doesn't have a great restaurant selection - the locals have come to begrudgingly eat at the four other supposedly homey restaurants in town, because they think that there are no other options (and also because it's important to them to sit on the sidewalk next to a line of 40 stopped cars gawking at them); however I often drive out of my way to eat at Char-Grill, because I've had the rest, and CG is clearly the best.  Parking is easy, unlike at other places in Davidson, thanks to the large Harris Teeter parking lot it shares."}
{"text":"Like many before me, I wanted to like this place too.  The good:  clean, good service, ample drinks and condiments.  The bad:  The Fries!  Tasteless.  McDonalds fries are much better.  My burger - not much flavor and it's always flattened (what's up with that?).  The price: too pricey for no taste."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with the family after a game. Ordered a burger with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions. Yummy! And the fries were better than expected. Burgers do look a bit smaller than the fast food chains but definitely have better flavor and texture. It was still very filling and everyone at our table left satisfied. Hubs had a vanilla shake with his equally delicious burger. It was great too but almost too thick for a straw. Overall a good place for a traditional burger, fries, and shake."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are made fresh but need a little flavor. Prices are high for style of food. Fries are boring. Would not eat here again unless I am stuck in the airport again.
Tables need cleaning, nobody at counter right now and every table needs to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am the BIGGEST Fan of Char-Grill. I grew up eating Char-Grill in Raleigh and my husband and I used to drive 2 hrs some weekends just for a Hamburger or Hot dog in Raleigh. So i couldn't have been more excited when i found out one was finally coming close to Charlotte. 

I went to Char-Grill on Saturday and ordered 2 hot dogs both with Chili on them as well as an Apple Pie (My Favorite). At the restaurant i opened my Apple Pie up only to find a Fried FLY was attached to my Apple Pie! So i immediately  took it up to the manager to show him the PIE with the FLY! He made sure none of the other customers saw this, quickly disposed of the evidence and said to me \"Sorry there are a lot of things flying around back here trying to beat the heat\" and handed me another apple pie. When we got in the car i told my husband, wow that was rude he did not even offer me an Apology! 

I wish the story ended here but no it doesn't. Within an hour I was on the toilet! By hour two I was on the toilet as well as with a Bucket in front of my face. I decided to call them once i was finished and tell the manager that their food had given me food poisoning hoping that this time someone would offer an apology up. Again I was wrong! Instead I received a \"Oh...well we have not received any other reports like this. Maybe it was something else you had earlier. Okay, well let me take down your number and IF we receive another food poisoning REPORT then we will give you a call back\"  I was FLOORED. I could not believe what i was hearing. Everything at Char-Grill is made to order so if something was wrong with my Order then wouldn't i be the only one to Report such a thing!? I never received a call back so on Monday i called again and requested to speak to the Store Manager - brace your Seats for the response i received out of him. \" Our hot dogs as well as chili both have MSG in them. Maybe you are allergic? I said no i am not allergic. Okay...Well the reports i am seeing that were reported that day tell me that our hot dogs remained at the correct temperature as our chili\" He proceeded to give me a 10 minute lecture on the reporting of what temperature his food was at in stead of just simply coughing up an apology! 

I have never heard of such nonsense and incompetence from any restaurant establishment before. Instead of just offering an apology and or a refund whether they thought their food gave me food poisoning or not! I would have never reported this, but instead to first blame it on something else i ate. Or give me a 10 minute food lesson on the history of hot dog temperature! Was not the correct response. 

I WILL NEVER eat at this Char-Grill if any Char-Grill every again in my Life. It is a shame that this Restaurant has single hand-idly ruined a child hood favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Ok experience.  Big clean dining area. I like the big windows that allow you to see the food prep area. The fries are tragically boring. Burger was good. Not as good as 5 guys or in and out, but ok for a fast food place.  I had burger, fries and a drink for 8 bucks. 
It will not be on my list of places I crave."}
{"text":"Somehow, the $5.39 bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich comes to $11.55 when you make it a combo. The receipt says Bacon Sand Combo $9.27.  Oh, you want an egg on that Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich?  That'll be an extra dollar.  Cheese?  That's $0.40.  #falseadvertising #ripoff (The sandwich was good, but not THAT good.)"}
{"text":"Great fries and burger. The cook even accommodated my no bun request with a lettuce wrap. Cashier was a ditz but you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Good for a quick breakfast at RDU airport if you get there before 5 am, when most other places are closed or still moving so slow they're of no use to anyone in a rush. There was a line for precisely this reason, but it moved quickly. 

I ordered an egg and cheese sandwich (less than $4) and it was ready in just a couple of minutes. Delicious, fresh eggs and melted cheese on a warm bun - exactly what I needed at 5 am. 

Will be back next time I take the ridiculously early flight from Raleigh Durham to the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Ahhh well Char-Grill. It might be time we part ways. 

Just when everything seemed to be going so well...

Separate incidents on different visits have encouraged me to take our dining-out dollars elsewhere.

1. Minor but nonetheless irritating, I placed an order for chicken tenders. Wasn't asked if I wanted the plain or seasoned batter AND got a young man with an attitude who gave me dirty looks and rude conversation because I didn't know the sauce for the chicken tenders was called dipping sauce.

Um... no.

2. There was also the incident where an older gentleman took our order (as opposed to the younger folk who usually do) and got one of the condiments wrong, resulting in a request for a new sandwich.

And he told the member of my dining party that SHE told him the wrong condiment. Which she did not. I was standing there when she placed her order. It's more likely he heard \"m\" and assumed mayo instead of mustard or thought he hit the right key.

Either way, how do you sustain a customer base by accusing a customer and using a derogatory tone of voice?

Um... no.

3. On another occasion, we went to the pick-up window and although my companion had her hand out for the bag, a young man working the window pushed our food across the counter at her and walked away.

Um... no.

4. Then there was the couple that came in with the dog. And the dog's water bowl. And the guy handed it to a young man standing at the register who filled the bowl from a sink in the general food prep area.

Um... HELL no.

I was willing to give the Char-Grill the benefit of the doubt because sometimes things happen. 

But the dog incident sealed it for me."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my steak burrito from Char-Grill, and if it wasn't so expensive, I'd probably give it 4 stars, but $8.59 + tax for a burrito smaller than a Chipotle burrito is a ripoff.  Yes, guacamole was included in their pricing but it was the thinnest layer of guac I've ever seen on a burrito.  If you ask for everything on your burrito, it's a pretty good size, but not quite Chipotle-level. I'd call it about Qdoba or Taco Del Mar size.

I would describe it as less flavorful as a Chipotle or Qdoba burrito, but significantly tastier than any of the ground-beef varieties you would get at Taco Bell. Sadly, this is probably your best bet for airport food if you're stuck in the RDU airport, but it's still not worth the price compared to eating as soon as you get out. I wish North Carolina would put restriction on airport vendor pricing like California does."}
{"text":"I had the hamburger steak sandwich and fries. That's is what they are \"famous\" for after all. The fries were average but not awful by any means. The burger, maybe one of the most under seasoned patties. Just no flavor. I know one of their big rivals must be five guys, I don't love five guys but they are leaps and bounds better rating burgers. I challenge the owner and managers to do a side by side Taste test and prove me wrong. Very disappointed for something they are famous for. I have not tried anything else but looking at other reviews, I should try other things."}
{"text":"The Salsaritos side of Char Grill is where I ate. Awesome steak thing! Hot, flavorful and the employees were wonderful! Best airport grub I've had in recent memory!!"}
{"text":"An airport burger that's tasty and juicy. This is something the airport has needed for a long time. Simple menu with fairly quick service. There really isn't a whole lot to say other than the burgers are good and the fries are equally as good."}
{"text":"Love to eat at the Char-Grill for lunch! It's a \"go to\" place. Lots of options, cool atmosphere, great food."}
{"text":"I have been to Char-Grill quite a few times, and about once a week for the last month or so. I can really only speak about the Hamburger Steak, because except for the time I ordered a hot dog, that is what I get every time. I am not generally a fan of well done hamburgers. And sadly, in North Carolina it is impossible to get a rare burger unless the place grinds the meat on premises. Still, for a well done burger, the ones at Char-Grill are tasty,with the grilling process imparts a nice flavor onto the meat. The choice of toppings is good, and they always manage to keep everything organized and neat. The fries are also very good. With perhaps one exception, they have always been cooked to order and have been served hot. I like to order the cole slaw although it is just a wee bit heavy on the mayo for me. If you are looking for a quick meal, try this
 place instead of going to a big chain. You will spend a couple of dollars more and will have a much better quality meal."}
{"text":"I'm going on a half hour waiting on a milkshake. I asked about it at 20 minutes and they said it was cooking. A milkshake."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Friendly staff and prompt service considering burgers are cooked to order. Restaurant and bathrooms are clean. Family friendly atmosphere. Big enough to easily accommodate a large group. We've been here several times and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"This place is beloved by the upper schools students across the street at Davidson Day School. And why wouldn't it be - greasy fries, burgers and fattening milk-shakes. As an adult, I'm not a fan. We've tried it several times and it's ALWAYS subpar to even Cook-Out!. Burgers taste greasy and frozen (not sure if they are frozen, but that'd be my guess), fries are greasy and nothing special, and the shakes are good. Nothing special about this place, but I'd rather pay less and get much better food, even if it means driving to Cook-Out, BK, or heck, even McD's!"}
{"text":"Between Char-Grill and CookOut, I think NC has something very special with this simple grilled burger concept. This is my second visit to Char-Grill (first at the airport location) and it is SO good! 

The burger tastes like one that you'd get fresh off the grill at a family cook out...well, if the person in your family knows what he is doing. The burger is fresh and cooked to order. Don't look for a page of topping options as they keep everything simple so that you can really taste the star of the show. The fries are just as good and are better than steak fries you get at other places. They really take the time to pay attention and get it right."}
{"text":"The employees working at this location looked totally uninterested in their jobs and operate at a snails place.  Do NOT go here if you want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent steak burger, but the hotdog and chicken tenders may be way underrated.  If you are a North Carolina chili dog aficionado this is a must stop.  Great chili fresh too."}
{"text":"*awesome* hamburger (the big one -- steak sandwich).  Skip the fries."}
{"text":"There's nothing I like more at an airport than finding an eatery at breakfast time that isn't traditional breakfast fare.  Flying Southwest via Terminal 1 at RDU on a recent Saturday morning, we were happy to find this local fave.

  They take your order at the register, then cook it up and holler when it's done.  Both of us had small cheeseburgers and we shared an order of fries.  I made the mistake of getting too much stuff on mine...was tasting too much like salad on a bun, but that was a simple fix...simply took some of the lettuce, tomato and onion off and ate them on the side.  

 I will say that without waiting outside with smoke all around, it's not the TRUE Char-Grill experience.  But it comes as close as can be inside an airport, and it's a nice true-Raleigh option for travelers."}
