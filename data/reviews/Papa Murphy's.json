{"text":"We have went to several Papa Murphy's around the valley, but this one by far has the best service. The staff was friendly and fast. The manager even shook our hands and thanked us for our service. It was very clean and all ingredients were fresh. They even gave us new coupons to replace the ones we just used. We will never go to another Papa Murphy's again."}
{"text":"I was iffy about having to cook a takeout meal in my oven myself at first, but it's worth it! Their pizza is really good, and unlike other pizza places I've been to they actually use gloves while preparing your food, so it seems more sanitary as well."}
{"text":"When it comes to low cost pizza, betas everybody.  Best bang for the buck.  Twice as much as anybody else for the price. Plus it's hot and fresh from my oven. With coupons, even better!!  Twice as much cheese and toppings compared to Papa Johns or Dominos. Stuffed crust is awesome."}
{"text":"Very friendly, helpful and the place was very clean. Prices are fair and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly. Happy this one opened - a lot closer."}
{"text":"The pizza is good no complaints there. My complaint is this is the second time I have gone there and the customer service had gotten bad. The new manager there is not very nice and it shows in her employees as well."}
{"text":"This take out pizza spot is fantastic! The pizza is great and the sides are also tasty, but the real reason I believe this place is great is because of the service. 

The girl who helped me (I think her name was Tani) was really helpful. Being my first time there she helped me order and explained the differences in the pizzas. What really shocked me was when she asked \"Do you want help to the car?\" after my pizza was ready. I'm a pretty good sized guy and could easily carry the items, so really she really was being polite. It was impressive service. 

Round of applause to her and the management team for the impeccable training at this location!"}
{"text":"Only way we could post is give it one star, nothing better than 4 kids playing grab ass. Some of the veggies were empty, said to wait they were getting more.Place was filthy, no clean up anywhere. Place is new with no management. We have pizza at other papa Murphy's stores,always been good. Will not go back and I live here! Go to the Craig st location, run excellent and the pizza was right on. Good luck"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great value! (Especially if you get their email/text discounts!) This is a prime example of the chain."}
{"text":"whenever I write a 'less than stellar' review, I always wait a few days. I just like to take all emotion out of the review. I have waited almost 2 weeks to write this - mainly because this Papa Murphy is less than a mile from my house and I always root for the local businesses in my neighborhood.
Here goes:
I have been to this location enough to fill up a punch card (12th visit gets you 50% off your next order)... So I thought - AWESOME! On Halloween, I don't want to cook and we are having people over before going downtown for the Las Vegas Parade. I bring a friend (who has never been to Papa Murphy's). I have talked up the place to her and convinced her that pizza would be better than Mediterranean food for the occasion. 
We walk in, there are 3 others in the shop, two are waiting for their pizzas and 1 is paying. We walk up to the registers, pick a couple of salads and grab a menu. We we not greeted, but, you know, people get busy - and we are gabbing away anyways. Well.... after standing next to the workers 'building' the pizzas and a few feet from the left register for 5 minutes - Another woman walks in to the shop. The manager or owner (I assume) who is building the pizza, asks another employee to help 'the guests.' 
The employee proceeds to greet the other woman and start taking her order. After a moment, the 'Manager' asks us if we've been helped. We let her know we hadn't. She proceeded to tell us because we weren't standing right at the register, thats why know one had helped us............ 
*REMINDER* : I've been here enough to earn the complimentary 50% discount. It's not my first rodeo at this place. AND we did go straight to the registers when we arrived. How would we have picked out the Greek Salads (which are in between the 2 registers).... 
Needless to say, a place that makes it the guests fault that they weren't helped is not a place that I need to spend money at.... It's really too bad! 
I have had no issues the other 11 times at this location - but those times I came in after 6pm (this visit was around 1:30pm). I have always been helped by the night male 'manager/owner' (assumption on title, but these are franchises that are proprietor owned)..........
I will say, I've never seen it busy at this location, so maybe when they get more than 1 or 2 people in their store at once they get a little \"overwhelmed.....\"
But, I think it will be awhile before I return, and needless to say, my friend will never get to try Papa Murphy's because she doesn't like rude service- especially when it's at a pizza place that you have to take home and cook yourself."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza, especially their pan pizza. I noticed the amount of toppings you get as well, and it is way more then other pizza places so you're paying less for more. Plus it is all fresh what more can I say."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Papa Murphy's location.  Yes, we are addicted to this pie and no,  all locations do not produce the same quality product.  Tara and her team own this store and they never disappoint.  High quality, inexpensive pizza.  Amazingly fresh salads too.  We love the S'mores Desert Pizza.  I serve it for breakfast - why not it's got oatmeal on it.  Always a great meal on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza available in Las Vegas. I always get the DeLite crust, as it reheats much better than the thicker crusts. You get to pick your toppings, and they have a bunch to choose from. The sauce is good, and the toppings always taste fresh. 

Look online for coupons before you go. The website always has some, and there is usually one for the DeLite crust. You can call ahead, but it usually only takes a few minutes if you go in to order.

The reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something. One time, it was the DeLite crust. They stretched the regular crust out instead. They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there, and various other toppings at one point or another.

But if you are looking for a cheap, tasty pizza and don't mind cooking it yourself, go to Papa Murphys."}
{"text":"They must have new management at this location. I've gone there for years but today when I went in the service was terrible. I had a coupon but they said I could only use it online. No problem. But it took them several times to clarify whether or not I had to go online. Still no problem. Then I proceeded to use their app in the store to order my pizza. But their app doesn't let you order all of the pizzas that they have available in the store. I talked to the same manager and she said that I couldn't use the coupon. The main problem is that they offered no real solutions, they were rude and I walked right out. I would not suggest going there anymore, though it used to be great. There are plenty of other great pizza places with better service."}
{"text":"Papa Murphys is one of my favorite pizza places. After moving to North Las Vegas from the Bay Area I found a Papa Murphy's on Lossee Road. Not only is the pizza fresh and delicious the service is friendly and the chocolate chip cookie dough makes wonderful cookies!
I went there on Monday (7/10) and the nice man working there even opened the door for me when I was leaving!
Great service, great pizza !"}
{"text":"Love Papa Murphy's, but this location has an issue with the dough. It never rises. Papa Murphy's is famous for the dough. We have tried the.deep dish, stuffed and regular. Same problem. Such a shame because the rest of the ingredients are fresh and the staff are polite and friendly. Please fix your dough."}
{"text":"Maria, the manager, has the freshest dough of any Papa Murphy's in the valley. I always stop here if I am in Goodyear!  Have been to them all and this is th best.  The store is always clean, they have the freshest ingredients and the dough always rises and tastes like it is made fresh daily."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good cookie dough, good coupons! Staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent location. Fast friendly. Even honored my punch pass from another store. Great prices and good take and bake pizza."}
{"text":"So where to begin......

I've been to this location three times and my experience has progressively gotten worse.

The first time I went here the service was fine for the most part and the pizza was good for this type of pizza.

The second time I went there I waited 20 minutes or so because they only had one person working and had 7 people or so waiting or ordering  pizza. The pizza was once again good for this type of pizza.

The third time I went there was again, only 1 person working and they would not take the coupon I just printed off coupons.com. The employee stated that they only take coupons that come to you via email.  The funny thing was they took my coupon last time and I printed that off of another coupon site.

My wait would not have been as long as last time as only 3 people were ahead of me but I still would have waited longer than I should have if I actually gave them my business. I decided to go elsewhere for dinner.

So if you like to wait, be frustrated by inconsistent couponing policies, this is your Papa Murphy's. Otherwise steer clear and find another pizza place.

2 stars for them as their pizza is good, but the service is sub par."}
{"text":"Excellent  experience. Very helpful  and friendly personnel. Pizza delicious. Price good. We got medium  crust, family- size loaded and medium  crust half  cheese  and  half  pepperoni. Had left overs. Will return !"}
{"text":"I just got an order from this store.  The product is fine.  The guy in charge tried to overcharge me by $8 for each of two pizzas.  He was making the pizzas while he explicitly told the assistant to add $8 on each pizza's price.  When confronted with why the charge to my card was so much he sheepishly gave me back $15 cash.  I cannot image how this can be called a mistake.  I believe he deliberately tried to overcharge me."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE your pizza!  A choice of crusts?  Truly great.  My personal favorite is thin.  The topping choices are great........what a good selection.  My sister lives in Indian Land and was complaining that the nearest store to her is in Ballyntine.  Hello???????  It's not like your pizza will be cold when you get it home!  I love baking it myself.  Hot and fresh from the oven.  It doesn't get any better than that.  I plan on trying a lot of them.  Except pepperoni.  I don't DO pepperoni!  Thanks for being here in Fort Mill.  You're literally down the street and around the corner from me.  Much success to you!"}
{"text":"We have ordered pizzas from Papa Murphy's several times and they have all been excellent. The prices are good too, as well as the service. It's a very good business model, and we residents of Fountain Hills should patronize good quality restaurants like Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"A great stop if you want to get some cheap pizza to cook at home for the family, but also want to pick up some Thai food next door at Thai Basil.

The staff is very friendly, and you can typically get out of there in under 5 minutes even when it's busy.  Otherwise you can call ahead, and even use the drive-through window if you prefer.

They typically have monthly specials, and you can easily get coupons if you sign up for their email list.

We prefer the deLITE style of pizza because it's a cracker-style crust, they use a different tomato sauce, and it's not overloaded with toppings.  You can also shave off about 100 calories per slice that way, to make room for beer."}
{"text":"TUESDAY SPECIAL: $10 any large pizza !!!! Too bad I came on a Thursday. Saw the commercial on TV and I was hooked. Ordered the thin crust chicken, bacon and artichoke pizza with garlic sauce.  AMAZING! Garlic makes everything better :)  For a take and bake this thing look GOURMET and the ingredients were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.

I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:

Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, \"sorry, we don't serve your type here.\" Mushroom says \"why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy).\""}
{"text":"Great, fresh-made Pizza! after I finished dinner, my phone was nowhere to be found. I called a couple times no answer. Meanwhile at Papa Murphy's my phone rings, the phone was locked with no way to answer. The gal behind the counter was thoughtful enough to use Siri to call the number back and let me know that I had left my phone. Sounds simple enough, but it's that kind of concern for the customer that you don't find every day, add some great pizza and you have an A+ establishment. Thank you PM's!"}
{"text":"This was the best customer service we've ever had any Papa Murphy's this will now be my new location."}
{"text":"The store looked clean when I came in but when I took my pizza home I noticed there were gnats trapped underneath the Saran wrap. When I opened it up it just got worse and now I have gnats all over my apartment.. Definitely regret coming to this location. I can't believe they gave me it cause there's no way they were oblivious to the situation.."}
{"text":"I used to love this place!! However today, Mathew \"the Owner\" told me I was just a customer and told me never to come back. This was all over the phone. I asked for four mini murph pizzas and was rudely told  I had to Pre order. RUDELY!!! This must be a new thing(which is fine) He told me he didnt  pay this much money amd work seven days a week for nothing!!!  He was yelling and screaming at me and if I was present in the store,  I would have been scared. It was embarrasing and demeaning. I have never been treated with this disrespect and humility. I have worked 14 yrs in retail and know that this BEHAVIOR is not tolerated nor exceptable. I will share my expierence with all of the Station Casinos and Casears entertainment and hope they will follow in my lead and not be treated with such poor quality.
Please do not give Mathew \"THE STORE OWNER\" any more of your time and or respect because you won't get any in return."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in the neighborhood.  Excellent customer service, and a great product.  Beats ANY of your traditional take-out pizza joints.  If you get the chance to meet the owner, let him know what you think, good or otherwise.  They'll go above and beyond to make your experience great.  From a repeat local customer."}
{"text":"We love this pizza.  I order the Gourmet Vegetarian Thin Crust pizza, with red sauce instead of white.  The staff is very nice, very accommodating.  I am able to alter the pizza to fit my reduced fat diet.  Delicious pizza!  The entire family loves it. Guilt-free pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The food was perfect. The owner was extremely friendly and took his time making the pizza perfect. I highly recommend the Huntersville, NC location specifically. Great customer service. Thus is my family's favorite!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I was so excited when I found out they were here in Vegas! The first time i had their pizza was in Delaware! They were fantastic there and just as great here. The staff is so nice and very helpful! So many restaurants in this town should take some notes!!"}
{"text":"We go in, it's quiet, it's clean, the service is friendly and we order our pizza. As they're making our pizza, the Cowboy, they then inform us that they are out of mushrooms. It would have been nice to know that they were out when we ordered and before we paid. We could have gotten a different pizza or gone to the one off Tropicana if we had known before hand. They offered us a different option of topping as long as it wasn't meat. We said no. They didn't offer us compensation for the inconvenience which was irritating. Pizza is still good, but make sure to ask them if they have all their toppings first before you pay since they apparently won't tell you beforehand. Maybe they need a sign that says when they're out of a topping that's on almost all of their pizzas."}
{"text":"Wasn't always a fan of take and bake back home but Papa Murphys is making me a fan. Definitely get on their mailing list because with the coupons and their specials it is a great deal. I love that it's a another new business in the area and it shows. The staff is very nice and when they hand you your pizza they open the door for you on the way out. The girl even remembered my son from our last visit. I hope they keep up the great service. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Pizza is fresh, tasty and a good deal.  This is our go to pizza place now."}
{"text":"\"Take & Bake Pizza\" - Remember that!

Sunday- Panthers Football time

Food: We ordered a classic, multi-meat pizza. The pie looked freshly prepared, not frozen, and was wrapped in a plastic type wrapping and placed on a cardboard-like mat. After bringing it home and heating it up for 15 minutes, the pizza was ok. Not great, not poor, pretty average even among pizza places in IT. In fact, we are not sure if this pizza, taste-wise, is superior to a pizza you would buy at your local supermarket which now also serve unfrozen pizzas.  

Service: Great. Very friendly service and welcoming inside. It is a brand new establishment so that is good to see. Importantly, the person who took our order over the phone was pleasant. Many times, we will call a pizza place and get the old busy busy what you want treatment. 

Price: Reasonable prices for the uncooked pizza. Again, you can probably get comparable prices at the supermarket though. We used brand opening coupons which compelled us to try this new restaurant in the first place.    

Other: We were honestly tricked on this one. Well, not tricked, but surprised, in our old age we failed to see that this pizza place is a \"take & bake pizza place\" meaning they prepare the pizza and then you take it home to heat it up in your oven. We got a brochure in the mail with coupons and saw the name Papa and thought what the heck.  We have tried Papa John's, Papa Ginos, Papa-etc before and thought why not give it a shot.  We have never seen a take and bake pizza place and never heard of Papa Murphy's even though they are a chain. The concept seems original, will it work in IT? Time will tell. Unfortunately, we just do not see us going back there again. It's a nice place and all, but when we order pizza or go to a pizza place, we're used to having it cooked and ready to eat. There have been times we have bought uncooked pizza, but we can easily do that during one of our grocery runs. 

Tip: If you go there, go with a coupon. You better have a pizza roller in your kitchen to cut your pizza! We happen to have one, but if we didn't it, it be pretty hard to cut the pizza. It is not pre-cut.  

Side note: Makes us very curious about the 5 star ratings and tremendous amount of praise this new place received. Are the 4 other reviewers truly unbiased to this pizza place? We have been eating different pizzas for over a combined 80 or something years, and in our opinion, this place, while average, does not get a return visit."}
{"text":"\"Fresh\" ingredients taste like they have been sitting in the back of the fridge for a month or so....gross.  I called to notify staff olives had really gone bad and shouldn't be used.  Only thing staff had to say was I couldn't get my money back unless I brought the bad pizza back. Hmmmmm
I wasn't trying to get my money back; I was trying to spare future customers a bad tasting experience."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, and the staff is always really friendly. I shop by every Friday for a pizza and their really good cookie dough."}
{"text":"We decided to try it after receiving the flyer in the mail. I called ahead and it was ready when I arrived to pick it up. The owner and son where great and even gave me the nutritional information flyer when I mentioned that I was losing weight but decided to splurge. To my surprise the deLite Mediterranean was not a diet buster. I also picked up the Cinnamon Wheel. 

The Pizza was awesome! My husband said \"This is really good, I think we will try another kind tomorrow.\" As for the Cinnamon Wheel it exceeded my expectations and taste like a Cinnabon. Ten times better than the Cinnapie (At Papa Johns).

I will be going back! FYI it is a Take-n-Bake restaurant, which means they build it and you bake it! Love them!"}
{"text":"This PM franchise is owned by a nice couple from Oregon, and they clearly care about their customers.  When the wife is working, this place is the friendliest joint in town.  I have zero complaints about the service here when she's working.  (And the pizza is pretty darn good, too.)

Her team of young ladies, however, can sometimes be a little more detached.  It's great that they're helpful, but they are inconsistent with the \"Take 'N' Bake Club\" stamps (their rewards program for repeat purchases), and I have been shorted my proper stamps several times.  Mentioning this to the owner yielded no empathy, so points off for that.  I deserve my recognition for coming back and buying more pizza, thank you.

Their freshness is the key here, and what makes this chain of pizza purveyors different seems to be the quality of the ingredients.  Love the rich, robust sauce, the cheese (which is NOT greasy - yay!), and the fresh mushrooms.  Food for thought: Canned mushrooms are a punishment for those people willing to settle for crap pizza.  And we enjoy the \"de-lite\" selections of thin-crust pizzas when we need to dial back the carb intake.

As a side note, the other poster, Katherine, obviously didn't know about the Thunderbird or Union Hills locations (run by different owners), but Papa Murphy's' has been around for awhile now.  

Bottom line: The pizza is very good, but come during the day when the owners are there.  It's a better experience."}
{"text":"Been a customer for a long time and generally very happy with them. On my last order though, they gave me the wrong pizza. I didn't have time to drive back there and get a replacement, so I called and explained the problem. The manager said that all he could do was give me $3 off my next order. I said that didn't sound reasonable considering I didn't get what I ordered and he said I would have to call the owner for anything else. So good pizza, but 0* on their customer service."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's!  Love the fresh ingredients, love the super friendly people who work there, love the pizza!  

You can't beat the price of their pizza - yes you do have to take it home and cook it.  It's as easy as turning on the oven.  And you get fresh, delicious pizza at a great price.  They always have coupons available, and the coupons never expire.  

I also love their cookie dough.  The cinnamon wheel is ok.  

My favorite pizzas - Perfect, Veggie, and Chicken and Bacon stuffed.  

I think I eat at Papa Murphy's once a week.  Hooray for great pizza!"}
{"text":"Have been visiting this shop on occasion for a few years, never had a concern or complaint. Am trying to eat healthy (snore) tried the white sauce garlic veggie thin crust. Quite TASTY! although my wife deserves some credit for completing this masterpiece to perfection. fresh hand made is becoming a priority for our dinnertime. It's an easily digestible meal for the price of an appetizer at our fave dine venue."}
{"text":"After driving by so many times I finally decided to give Papa Murphy's a try.  I assumed it would be cheap since it was a take-and-bake joint and that it would be doubly cheap with a coupon I got for signing up for their emails.  You know what they say happens when you assume, right?

So anyways, I think we paid around $10 for a pizza that wasn't even cooked.  Ten bucks might have been fair since it was a little larger than, say, Papa Johns or Pizza Hut pizzas- but it didn't even taste that great.  It wasn't bad by any means but it was definitely forgettable.

They did have very nice employees and at least they weren't cheap on the toppings.  But the next time I'm lazy and in the mood for a pizza, I'll just call up one of the chains and get one ready to go for $10."}
{"text":"I love this place when I want pizza.  I love the freshness and the smell of baking the pizza at home.  My family prefers this place over Domino's and Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This is a nice take and bake pizza place. I went in to order a Gluten Free pizza. The only problem is they share the pizza sauce with all the non Gluten Free pizza's too. Doing this would make some one very sick if they had celiac or a wheat allergy. So I talked to the young man at the register and he said that they would be happy to get a new spatula and new sauce to top the Gluten Free pizza with so that there would be no/very little cross contamination."}
{"text":"We order out from Papa Murphy's a few times every year, and the staff are pleasant enough. The food is fine, though I agree it's an unusual business model: the pizza costs more than a premium frozen pizza and you do have to bake it. That said, I find it's much less expensive than other local pizza joints like Glass Nickel which (while tasty!) are considerably more expensive. On the balance, this Papa Murphy's strikes a balance of value and convenience that occasionally wins the day for our family."}
{"text":"First time trying this location. All pizzas and bread sticks are take and bake which make prices lower than other pizzas places. Pizzas are on a paper plate and is used one time only to bake. If you leave pizzas on plate entire baking time, the crust is rubber like. You will need to slide off pizzas onto a rack or stone during cooking to obtain a crunch like crust. The sauce is some what spicy and breadsticks do not have much flavor. If you are serious about pizzas and their taste, this place may not do."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we ordered a pizza from here and had a bad experience both times. The first time they had us on hold for 13 min and when my daughter called on her phone while I was still on hold, they said they forgot I was still on hold. The second time we just placed an online order to be picked up at this location for a gluten free, no cheese Murphy Special with bacon, garlic and herbs added we got this. We only noticed once home that they just made a pizza with our extras. Very upset. Now we have to drive back and hopefully get the pizza that we ordered. Wouldn't you think the person making this would think maybe I should double check the order because this doesn't look right!"}
{"text":"My order is always ready when I show up! Tasty and delicious every time. I love having the option to add on breads, salads, desserts, etc. onto the meal. One stop for all my pizza needs."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!  Just discovered it. Been there 4 times in 2 weeks. Each specialty pizza I've gotten is delicious...we like hot pizza from our own oven without the mess. I order thin crust only and its excellent so cannot speak to other crust. Hubs and I eat an extra large thin crust and always have some left over.  The staff is all extremely nice,, lightening fast, very good at their jobs!  Kudos to this store!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicago Stuffed Pizza and it was amazing!The crust was stuffed with all kinds of meats: Salami, Pepperoni, Etc. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure if everyone knows how good this pizza truly is but you need to try it. Love the gourmet veggie pizza! Fresh and  a great value!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian.  Very good pizza, staff is very friendly and helpful.  My fav pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a reasonable price. Very creative to offer take & bake and makes dinners much more efficient."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The pizza is yummy and not greasy at all! The staff is friendly and helpful. We will continue to get dinner here weekly!"}
{"text":"Just had the craziest experience. My mom had called the store asking for a certain person who worked there (our order was messed up before and we were told that we would be comped the next visit). Immediately the \"owner\" Carrie yelled \"Jason doesn't work here!\" and slammed the phone on my mom. In complete disbelief, we called again and this Carrie lady yells \"I told you there is no Jason here! Were too busy to deal with this.\" And slammed us again. We decided to take a stroll to this location and we were greeted nicely (not one person was in this store, must be pretty busy), and once my mom asked to talk to the owner Carrie knew who we were. She screamed at us saying were not welcome and that they're too busy, running out dough, and product. There was a huge scene caused by this Carrie woman and I have never been treated so rudely in my entire life. We've been to this location HUNDREDS of times and never once did we encounter something like this. I wouldn't even give this place one star."}
{"text":"Tried this a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. I got the stuffed meatlovers with veggies. You can literally eat one massive slice and call it a night lol. Sauce was tasty. I'm a sauce guy and most places barely use any unless you request extra, not sure when that horrible fade started. Everything tasted pretty fresh and flavorful. Will definitely go back and try something else. Good concept"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. 5 employees stood around joking while I waited to be helped.  Them fought in front of me about who had to help me. Awful!!! They obviously don't care about their customers. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood papa murphys! The owner is so nice and all of their employees have learned that business standard from her. Always a smile and kind word. And we feel we get great quality, fresh product from here. Please try this business you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Papa Murphys and this is a great location. Food is always well prepared and fresh."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out they offer gluten free crust and the first time I went in I asked if they could make one half like breadsticks and the other half pizza so my daughter wouldn't feel left out. The manager was accommodating and kind and told me it was no problem and I could get it that way every time. 
Every time we go back to do it they look at us confused and tell us they can't do it and we have to fight them on it. Tonight they did that again. We redeemed a free pizza but he did not offer us a new stamp card even though we ordered multiple pizzas. I went back for a Chicago stuffed pizza and the woman putting it together was either flirting with her coworker or staring off into the distance and didn't notice I had a special order. When she topped it with cheese she didn't add enough to even cover the sauce. I asked for more cheese and after having to repeat myself because she wasn't paying attention to me she took about 20 shreds of cheese and tossed it on top. I'm disappointed in the poor customer service and the lack of cheese on my pizza! Papa Murphy's always is super cheesy but tonight I had to go home and add more just so the sauce would be covered! This location disappoints me."}
{"text":"I come here about twice or more a month, the quality and price just can't be beat. I take advantage of the email specials I get. I like getting the white sauce instead of the red on my pizza. Customer service is excellent and they are fast. Love Papa Murphy's pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Super-close to home, and just feels (and tastes) like a fresher, healthier option than Dominos or Pizza Hut.  The employees are always friendly, and my orders have all been 100% correct.  I'd like to try their ready-made salads and will update my review when I do!"}
{"text":"If you want INCREDIBLE pizza for a fraction of the cost of a regular pizza place this is where to go, as long as you don't mind baking it yourself! My personal favorite is the Chicken Bacon Stuffed pizza. Its 100% AMAZING! With simple, easy to follow instructions you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"I tried to order a pizza for a family member who lives in Madison (I live in a different state) who just got out of the hospital. However, Papa Murphy's doesn't take payments over the phone and they don't have the option to order on their website (at least not on the mobile site).  This is pretty pathetic for a business in this modern-day. Please offer payment over the phone or on your website at the very least.

I had to take my business elsewhere (in this case, Toppers, which was very accommodating, and no this isn't a paid ad for them, I just feel like they should get a pat-on-the-back for accommodating my order when Papa Murphy's couldn't).

Papa Murphy's, please embrace technology - it's a great thing!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just get lucky.  We discovered Papa Murphy's on Losee by accident and have been hooked ever since.  The great people who own and work there are former Air Force....what's not to like about that?  And, they make the most delicious pizza we have ever tasted.  Whenever Brother Bill visits from Summerlin, we have to get the Family size, so we have some left over for breakfast.  If it's just Pat and me, she limits us to the Large.  I don't like it, but we still have some left for breakfast.

Pat, Steve and Brother Bill"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Cheap, quick, and easy way to feed a family no matter what size."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff!! Finally, good pizza in Az. Try the thin crust. Tues 10$ deal is really worth it."}
{"text":"This is easily the best pizza I've had in a long time.  Not only is it a lot better than most other pizza chains it's a lot cheaper too.  Also the staff is courteous and professional.  They had my pizza ready just a few minutes after placing my order. I will definitely be going back soon and often."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Especially like their galic sauce and chicken! Open just when u need it and easy parking area. Staff are wonderful too!"}
{"text":"I live close to the Stephanie Street location. In the last year I have purchased about four pies and really enjoyed my service and the food. Last month I purchased a pie and after eating a couple of slices I noticed long curly brown hair was baked into the crust of the pizza. 
I was sooooo disgusted. Never going back. A clean establishment is very important."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for their artichoke pizza which my family loves. Most of the time, the owner and the staff are good except for one occasion  when they forgot to put artichoke on my artichoke pizza. I let that pass without complaining since what is one mistake. Today, I was there again to buy a large cheese pizza, advertised for $5 (no coupons necessary). I was given a large, already prepared pizza with obviously not enough cheese on it. I thought, I can't complain, it's cheap pizza. When I went home and checked my receipt, I realized I was charged $9+ tax for it. I called and was told to come back to get a refund. When I went there, I was told that the advertised large $5 pizza is actually a medium pizza stretched to large and is always ready and I didn't tell him when I bought the pizza earlier that that 'medium stretched to large\" was the one I wanted. I was dumbfounded.  I left and didn't get my refund. I find no point arguing and wasting my time over $4. I love Papa Murphy's pizza but I am not going to this location again."}
{"text":"I am totally stoked!!! I remeber in my past review on the one in hillsboro oregon saying they didnt have on ein vegas!!! I am sooooooooooo hapy they do!! I LOVE the garlic sauce they use for the veggie delite and it also comes in family sixe which is XL lol!! Of course i got it and since i have been craving the tar out of it i ate 3 huge pieces!!! DELISH! the delite is my favorite, cuz they have thin crust and tons of toppings...Fresh toppings!

I learned tonight to call them ahead of time for a to go order cuz this place was packed!!! another thing is they give military discount!!! That is ALWAYS a plus! :D"}
{"text":"We ordered a couple of pizzas last night for dinner. The Hawaiian pizza was terrible, tasteless. Not sure what happened, the sauce tasted horrible, we paid for extra jalepenos that had maybe 10 peppers on a large pizza?? They really skimped on the toppings, very little cheese, not enough pineapple and ham. Inedible, had to throw out. Not worth the money we paid!!"}
{"text":"If u like fresh toppings thin crust pizza then this the place. The cheese bread was real cheesy and awesome. To get even crispness after 10 min I removed the trays from pizza n cheesy bread. It came out awesome. If u like baking your pizza and control the crispness then Papa Murphy's is the joint. Good stuff."}
{"text":"First-time customer. Store was clean and not busy (no customers at 4pm Sunday). Three employees working (two on pizza line and one on the register) and were extrenely courteous, professional and helpful. We ordered three  16\" family-size pizzas (serves 4-6 people; Taco Grande, 5-Meat Stuffed and Chicken & Bacon Stuffed).
Gave five-stars for preparation, presentation, and friendly-service.  Pizzas were completely deeeeelish!!!
For menu, click here: http://www.PapaMurphys.com/m/our-menu/"}
{"text":"Consistently good. They send out coupons randomly too. We are a fan of the stuffed pizzas. The desserts are good too. We pass on the salads only because they are small and not really worth the price, you're better off stopping at Smith's and getting a fresh salad."}
{"text":"I have been to this place quite  a few times and their pizzas have always  been  good. Way better than pizza hut and dominos. 
My favs are the herb chicken Mediterranean delite, chicken bacon artichoke delite. We have eaten the cowboy  stuffed  pizza which is also really good and gives you leftovers because it's so filling.
They have call ahead if you dont like waiting but even at their busiest the wait isnt bad.
The staff is friendly and always  greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"First time I tried Papa Murphy's was at a friends who made some for my friends birthday and I really liked the pizza. Especially the fact that it is hot, and fresh out of the oven and you can control the level of doneness that you desire.  We had Chicken Bacon Artichoke deLite, And a pepperoni sausage pizza. Ingredients were fresh, the chicken was of good quality as were the other ingredients.  I look forward to trying more flavors."}
{"text":"First off the pizza is fine as in every other one I've been too. I am not impressed with the staff at all, in fact I won't be going back because of the staff. Went there a week ago and it was like a chucky cheese on crack.  The manager or line manager(what ever he is) was yelling at his staff the entire time, loudly, and the staff were loudly ignoring his yells to do something. It was a complete free free for all. If I owned the place and stopped in and heard this guy yelling like he was, he would have been out.  I'm not one to care about the chaos but this was over the top."}
{"text":"Never had a bad pizza from this place! The wife picked up a large chicken and bacon pizza on her way home tonight and in convinced I'm going to beg for a pizza once a week.

Especially since she works so close to it and we live so far west, NO ONE will deliver pizza to us. Regardless, this one would be better anyways."}
{"text":"I have only been to this location twice and both times it was around 12 pm 
Hubby and I are in love with their pizza! Customer service is excellent, they're always so friendly ... and we did the survey to get the coupon for free desert. Large steak fajita pizza and smores desert pizza only $10 You can't beat that right?
Desert pizza was to die for. seriously. Lol we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"It was really good pizza taste fresh loved the ingredients I chose for it the Chicago style. friendly environment and they are really helpful in case of any questions on baking the pizza. You could even see them making the pizza which was nice."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Maybe the best in town.

This pizza is DELICIOUS. Every component of the pizza is top notch. Wait time is minimal, and so is the price. 

I've had all the pizza in Madison.
Papa murphies is hands down my go-to place for pizza."}
{"text":"Went in to pick up a pie today for dinner tonight. Clean and efficient store with great pizza value. I dinged it one star because there was a teen employee in back cutting vegetables and saw me come in. He didn't say anything and let me stand there for 5 minutes while he finished his cutting. I then gave my order to him and a small women came out to do the cashier thing. Serious tension between the two. Made me feel uncomfortable. I am assuming the female was the male's boss and didn't like it. 

TIP: deal with it son, females rule the world."}
{"text":"Love their meat lovers family style for pizza night. Always consistent and never a bit left."}
{"text":"Grabbed a family size 1/2 hawaiian 1/2 combo on my way to watch DVDs with the girls last night. What a great crowd pleaser and as always the servers were speedy & courteous."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  The manager is a complete jerk.   The pizza is fine and not any different from any other Papa Murphy's,  but the staff, the manager in particular,  are awful.  They act like they are doing you a favor if they decide to wait on you.  In the 3 times that I have been there the manager has been rude and will let you just stand there at the register without even acknowledging that you are there. Even if you stand right in front of him he will ignore you.  On top of that they have given me the wrong pizza one time and added ingredients that I didn't ask for another time."}
{"text":"Until recently, I've never had a Papa Murphy's pizza. When my daughter was born,  a church member dropped off a pizza for my family to enjoy. We cooked the pizza and enjoyed the pizza very much.  I wanted more, but the pizza was all gone.

Since the pizza was dropped off, I've gone back twice to indulge in the pizza.. The last two times I've made the short trek to the store to order and pick up the pizza myself.

The ingredients are fresh, made to order and is done quickly. You're in and out within just a few minutes. There are many ingredients to choose from, all the standard dare-meats, cheese and toppings.

The staff is very friendly and courteous.

Become a member of the Papa's Murphy's online club and get coupons or go to the website to save a little bit on your next order.

I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"As stated, my review is to help others...Ordered two pizzas. One was made correctly, one was not even close. My daughter called Papa Murph (lol). They said for the inconvenience of receiving the wrong pizza, which we paid $14 for, they will give us a $3.00 credit. I believe thats approximately what it costs to make a pizza. However that's also what it would cost to drive back there..so no mor Murphy for us. Oh yes, the owner is conveniently out of town. 

Keep the $14.00 and keep the $3.00 inconvenience fee. 

So long Papa Murphy, Papa Murph, or...whatever. 

PS. My wife called and received the same, no customer satisfaction at the least. One chance, two chance, three chance...not at all. 

Unhappy, lost customer, no concern for customer service. 
Wonder what a bad review costs???"}
{"text":"I had a gluten free pizza. The crust is gummy. I buy gluten free pizza from the grocery store( udis) and i love it. I commend Papa Murphy's for having a gluten free choice."}
{"text":"The pizza is great but I won't be ordering any time soon. Customer service at this location is horrible. I once showed up to pick up my order and they informed me I had to pay cash since their system was down. They could have called to let me know that. I have tried to use online coupons a half dozen times and the website is horrible. When I call the store, they acknowledge there are problems with their website but won't honor the coupons unless you order online."}
{"text":"One of our family's favorite choices for pizza...staff has always been very friendly and helpful at this location even when we have to customize their specialty pizzas for the kids. Over the summer we have also tried their s'mores pizza and it was a big hit.  Our favorite right now is the  Herb Chicken Mediterranean....would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, good and affordable! Staff always friendly. Loving Tuesday specials. I wish they had more locations!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with fresh quality ingredients . Friendly staff, great customer service (they are happy to customize your order). Love it & the price is right!"}
{"text":"Wonderful bake-it yourself pizza.  My friend and I always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese.  There's a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that's great as well.  They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also.  Service went downhill there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing, because they were wanting to clean up for the night.  But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice again.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality.  A winner!"}
{"text":"Always great service and quality! These people giving bad review are rediculous and the reason Yelp is so unreliable. You forgot YOUR coupon and blame the business? What a tool!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Papa Murphy's but we didn't have it back in NY where I'm from. Since moving to Vegas, I've been trying to find a decent pizza and while nothing really comes close to a genuine NY pie, this was by far the best chain pizza I've had outside of NY. I love the fact that I can pick it up and make it on my own at home when I'm ready to eat so I'll always have it hot and ready when we're ready to eat. The price was fantastic - $12 for a pizza with like 5 different toppings, we can't even get a plain back home for that much! The sauce and the toppings were all fresh, we only waited 3 or 4 minutes to have it made for us when we ordered it and it tasted just as good the next day when we ate the leftovers. The staff was very friendly as well. We also picked up the S'mores dessert pizza which I just heated up actually and it looks and smells fantastic. We also signed up for the text message alerts and got a free container of cookie dough which we made last night and they were perfect cookies!

Is this on the line of a coal/brick oven pizza or an authentic NY pie? Obviously not... but if you're comparing it fairly against other chain pizzas and for what it sells itself as, this is a great pizza for a great price!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, really good pizza. Had a horrible experience  at the Decatur  location but this one made up for it. Would definitely  go to this location again"}
{"text":"Make sure you get ur money's worth. Dont pay for extra for extra stuff as they dont look like they put extra. I guess it depends on location but this location by far is not great..."}
{"text":"First timers and I must admit the 5 meat stuffed pizza is delish! I will admit I was hesitant at first. 

In regards to baking the pizza... It was simple. I baked it for 20 minutes and it was perfect! 

I am looking forward to trying a gourmet pizza next time."}
{"text":"We've been going to the papa Murphy's on Reems Rd. In Surprise since it opened and have noticed they are using a lot less ingredients than they were were using as recently as a year ago.  I have noticed that when the owner is there they really load up on the ingredients, so go figure.  Kinda makes you wonder where the ingredients not being put on the pizzas are ending up?"}
{"text":"This location was great!! I ordered in advance and everything was ready when I got there. My order was correct and they were SO friendly! Pizza was delicious and so was the s'mores pizza! I will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty and super affordable pizza -- especially with coupons and text offers. Great for an easy, fast meal. The staff is always friendly and efficient. Obviously well trained. We've tried a variety including different types crusts and specialties and liked them all."}
{"text":"I frequent this place and have always had consistently good service!!! And now they have gluten free pizza. Wahoo!"}
{"text":"Good toppings and this location is very friendly. Not crazy about the prices, large pepperoni, unbaked, $12? Try $8

But my kids like it!"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's back on the west side! I missed this place when the one on Flamingo and Jones closed years ago. We ate it every two weeks. New store:

Pizza: Awesome as usual. Their large pie is larger than most other joints, around $10, Family size is $2 more. Dough is very good and when you bake it at home, you can control how crisp the bottom is. They are not skimpy on toppings either. The baking tray it comes on is super. By making it at home, your pie is hot out of the oven, not lukewarm and soggy like delivery pie. The pizza will bake perfectly.

Staff: Very friendly and helpful.

Value: All things considered, size of pie, fresh ingredients, large topping selection, great dough, bake it hot at home, it is worth every penny! This is not like Cici's or Little Caesars, much better.

Give it a shot and I think you will be happy."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Pizza was fantastic but the employees really made it. I will almost never go to another pizza establishment just because of the two girls working today. I believe the cashiers name was Teri, she made the experience for us. If she's not a manager, she deserves to be. Thanks again! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm here about  twice a month the service is great, The owner is friendly she always remembers what I order, always fresh ingredients, it's nice to pick it up and bake it when you want it, always comes out perfect. What more could you want."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about the \"take and bake\" but it is actually a great idea and the pizza is amazing! It is inexpensive and great quality, customer service is great too! It's like a subway for pizza! My boyfriend and I got 2 pizzas, one pepperoni and the other hamburger, bacon and pineapple, we also got the cheese bread and a cinnamon wheel. All for UNDER $30! ($25 to be exact) I recommended everyone to try this place out!! Put the pizza in the oven for 10 minutes and it's ready. This is by far better than any pizza place I've tried and I eat pizza every week, I use to get Da Vincis but ever since trying Papa Murphy's I'm not going anywhere else. VERY SATISFIED!!"}
{"text":"Great value. As good or better thn most higher priced pizza joints in Scottsdale. Cooks perfect everytime and  always coupons available. Must try the Thin Crust."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's makes a great product and this store goes out of their way to combine incredible pizza with outstanding service! I went in for $10 Tuesday and was very happy that they were so busy. There were a few call-in orders and several families with multiple pizza orders. The four employees were ALL scrambling -- Sierra was working the register, the phone, the ingredient line, running to the back, and helping her co-workers. No one was doing less than their best, but they were extremely concerned with the amount of time we were waiting. It was dinnertime rush on a promotional night - not a single customer in the store was unpleasant or bothered in any way - and the time we had to wait was well within reason and oh-so-worth it! Adam offered a complementary side for our inconvenience, thanked us over and over, and before we could even turn around, Sierra was there to hold the door and wish us well. I hope the management team recognizes these employees for being the reason we keep going back! Thanks Sierra, Adam, and the rest of the crew. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Bummed. Wanted a pizza entered store at 7:50pm & was told they were closed. I called earlier & was told they we're open till 8pm. Guess they didn't want my money."}
{"text":"The only nice thing about this place is different very very different than a normal pizza place.
I would only recommend this place if you want change because if you want good pizza this is not the place for you. The parking here is brutal Bruno parking there is none."}
{"text":"Very yummy pizza. My new favorite pizza place on town. Staff is very friendly. Perfect for picking up and cooking later."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here. My first time I went with a buddy who bought a stuffed pie. It wasn't that good...not enough sauce. Today I went with a free pizza coupon and ordered a thin crust with extra sauce and sausage. It was pretty good. What impressed me was the lady preparing my pie asked me mid-preparation if it had enough sauce (showing me the pie). It did. I wish she did with the sausage as well...very skimpy amount of sausage. Hence, the 4 star rating. I'll go again and order extra sauce AND sausage."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Go here anytime I want pizza! The kids love it and the family size is perfect! They added lots of new options so you can make great combinations of your own pizza! Love the food and the price is great for the quality of the ingredients! I go so often I have a free pizza coming the next time so I won't feel guilty about getting a S'mores Dessert Pizza as well! The kids also love the Mini Murph's and they enjoy having a pizza just for them! Overall love the quality of the food and the great service time and time again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the pizza, here.  Sorry to say.  When our two teenage eating macines won't eat this leftover pizza in the fridge and it ends up getting tossed, it's not good pizza.

Same price for cooked pies at Pizza Hut that are much better, according to this fam.

Didn't accept their own gift card because we ordered online.  Poor customer service, just told us too bad."}
{"text":"Fourth time trying this location after moving to the area. Staff is unfriendly and incompetent. Skimpy on toppings compared to other locations. Then they charged me for salad dressing when I bought a salad. CRAZY. This never happened at the Surprise location @ Bell & Reems (amazing staff). Our weekly pizza stop will be at another place."}
{"text":"Top rate! Clean & friendly. Great selection.  My family orders at least once per week."}
{"text":"When I order the thin crust pizzas, the toppings don't go to the outer edge of the crust (about 1\" in) & the crust looks dried out like it was sitting too long. When baking the pizza the outer edge curls up & gets very brown & hard & the bottom of the crust won't brown at all & is almost soggy in texture. I don't know if they use too much oil as part of the sauce or the crust is not made properly made (???) but this has happened with the last 2 pizzas we have had. The cowboy pizza on regular crust seems to be ok, but the thin seems to be a problem. Always had good luck until we moved to Nevada with Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"Arrived just before closing time and the employees were very helpful in making our pizza.  Like the fresh ingredients used in their food.  Our third visit to this location and have been pleased every time"}
{"text":"This location does NOT sell added on.  Remember each location is a franchised so each visit should be a chance to sell offer a frequent card or give suggestions.   If this place was not close I would go to union hills and 91 st."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza's.  A go to for our family, especially with visitors from out of town.  We love how fresh the ingredients are, and the delicious combinations.  Very supportive our of our local high school, which is much appreciated.  Worth the trip to the other side of the 101."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such race reviews. I have been here 3 times and nothing special. The pizza is no better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. Only difference is I have to take it home and cook it myself."}
{"text":"Used to visit once or twice a week, now i drive all the way across town to a different one. This particular store doesn't open at the time the website says, they do't even list an open time on their door any longer.....they open whenever someone feels like showing up. The last 2 visits before i stopped must have been made with old dough.....soggiest crust ever and I definitely know how to cook one of these pizzas."}
{"text":"Will definitely return! Stopped in, and picked up a Cowboy pan for the bf and I. Generously prepared, baked up perfectly and very delicious.  May come back tomorrow! Yumm yumm!"}
{"text":"Costs more than Papa John's and is kind of a hassle to have to bake it when you get home.  The bake it yourself thing is supposed to be a tradeoff for keeping the prices down so it kind of defeats the purpose when you can get a baked pizza cheaper somewhere else.  Plus, you can only bake one pizza at a time (and trust me, if you ignore these instructions, you will regret it), which is really inconvenient.

The service is very slow and the kids working there aren't people you want sticking their bare hands all over your food.  Yep, that's right.  Even though there are diced vegetables, cheeses, dough, and meats to handle, there is not a single plastic glove to be found.  Ick.  Today, my pizza was made by a girl with tattoos all over her hands and arms (including a lovely one of a topless woman on her forearm) and facial piercings.  Now, I have nothing against personal expression through tattoos or piercings or whatever, but this girl just looked DIRTY.  Watching her mash her hands all over the the dough of the pizza I was going to eat made me want to run out of there, but unfortunately I'd just forked over about $35 for two small pizzas and salads.  To top it all off, I was in the place for almost 20 minutes due to the very slow and inept service.

I used to go here frequently when it first opened and found it to be a great deal wth great service.  I hadn't been in for a year or so, and I really wish I'd stayed away."}
{"text":"I live down the street and come here regularly.  Natasha was very standoffish and rude.  Pizza is always great and price is very reasonable.  Service unfortunately was trash."}
{"text":"TREVOR & JEFF ARE AWESOME!!!  
They both provided excellent customer service with a smile.  Trevor has creative ideas on how to increase business sales for their employers.  Jeff made sure every pie was made to perfection.  Definitely will return simply because of them!"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from here at a unnamed health food restaurant lol so my coworkers and I order from here at least 3 times a week!! We always order the 5 meat stuffed pizza which is super good and we feed our crew of 6 with left overs, and their service is excellent they great you by name and open the door for you as you step out with pizza in hand. Thank you!! You guys are awesome!!"}
{"text":"I go here way more than I'd like to admit.  I think I've actually convinced myself that because I'm baking it, it's healthier (and homemade).  Makes no sense, I know.

I am also lured to the Papa Murphy's by it's copious coupon deals.  They regularly mail out a book of coupons that contain some pretty good discounts.  Obviously, cheap,\"homemade\" pizza cannot be resisted.

Overall, Papa Murphy's isn't the best pizza.  It's worlds better than the freezer section and, to me, better than places like Dominos and Pizza Hut.  

P.S. This location is spotless and provides quick service.  Also, if you're on an EBT diet, they randomly accept those."}
{"text":"Yes, they put the pizza together and then you cook it at home. I know, that's weird. You'd think it would affect the quality, but it doesn't. The ingredients are fresh, the choices are plentiful and the price and quantity you get is very high. 

There's a reason Zagat has rated this the best pizza chain multiple times, and there's a reason people listen to Zagat and not random biased reviewers who only get noticed by virtue of writing the first review. 

Papa Murphy's gives you quality food for a good price and you don't even have to deal with waiters, seating, or any of the trappings of a normal restaurant environment. It's a low key good quality experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I moved to the Peoria area about 7 months now and I was trying to find that one really good local pizza joint and I finally found it a few months ago! This place has such a unique place, you can have the exact pizza you love and as fresh as possible because it's baked in your own oven. They use fresh ingredients, awesome sauce and it's pretty affordable ply they have this stamp card so after so many purchases you can get a free family size! I highly recommend this place for any family looking for some good fresh pizza that won't break the bank in the process"}
{"text":"After cooking all week long and exhausted caring for my 8 mo GS all day (not that I mind), I wasn't in the mood to fix dinner. Hubby was all too pleased because he wanted to try the pizza at the recently opened storefront next to Albertson's. These are handmade, custom order pizzas that you take home to bake. All I could think of were those ones I used to order from the school kids selling them as fundraisers and they were horrible. Hubby said it was highly rated by Zagat. He also had a coupon so Daughter#1 and he drove down to place their order. There were about a half dozen patrons, all who appeared to be delighted with their selections - among them a family with hungry teenagers who were especially excited about their stuffed pizza which I was told was humongous.

It did not take long for Hubby's pizza to be assembled. Since I don't like pepperoni, Hubby asked if he could order 1/2 Meat deLITE and half Veggie deLITE on the thin crust and was told that would not be a problem.  For 3 people, the large seemed to be more than sufficient. Upon paying, Hubby presented a $5 off coupon that he printed from the web. The young lady took a long look at the coupon and informed Hubby that it was not theirs. Apparently Hubby printed off a coupon from Fresh&Easy mistakenly thinking it was for Papa Murphy's. How he could do that I still don't understand, but the young lady told him to wait a second and she would talk to the manager. When she returned she said that they would honor it!!  Really? There was no reason that they needed to do that, but they did. What great public relations! After all, the pizza itself was still only $10 and now with a $5 coupon, it was crazy cheap!

When Hubby and Daughter#1 brought the pizza home, I was skeptical that it would taste very good. It was sitting on a paper tray and I was just about to remove it and place it on a pizza stone, when they said it was supposed to be baked on the tray. After about 12 minutes, I looked at the pizza and checked out the crust and it was perfectly crispy. The veggie half consisted of a garlic sauce, fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, and fresh Roma tomatoes. It was soooooo good. I could have eaten the whole half myself. The meat half was made with an herb tomato sauce, pepperoni, sausage and ground beef. It was not greasy and although I did not taste it, it quickly got devoured. 

Papa Murphy's I am excited that you are open for business because I am coming back!"}
{"text":"I felt it necessary to submit a Complaint on my recent purchase at this new location, usually the Pizza is really Good. This was the worst pizza I have ever received in all of the 20 plus years from Papa Murphy's! This is my third Pizza from this new location

We ordered a family size thin crust Papa's Perfect (which was far from Perfect!)  I added artichoke hearts on the pepperoni side & sausage on the other. The toppings were barely added. The artichokes were only a few of the small leaves maybe a 1/4 cup total!! and I could count maybe 8 sausage's on the other side. I know you weigh your toppings but this was Ridiculous! Extremely disappointed!!!  It will be a very long time until we order from Papa Murphy's again! The one positive note: The gal that took my order over the phone was Super Great!"}
{"text":"TACO Pizza....very very very good. I love that it is \"Subway style\" - they will make it in front of you and you can add & remove ingredients. Take home to freeze or heat up later that night. GLUTEN FREE crust that is worth the option to try. If I could change anything it would be their closing time. I get off work when they close so it would be nice if possible to stay open and hour more. There is an option to call in your order but I can't ever seem to get there until after closing so I stopped doing that. But hey, beggars can't be choosers. Staff is nice, place is clean. Prices are right on mark with coupons.  They have cookie dough that is good and salads. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Had to go to bank, asked if fiance wanted me to pick something up to eat. He said \"I got you two (my daughter and i) a pizza\". I was excited about this idea, until I got home and saw it was this place, again. Supposedly, \"half and half\", half cheese (I'm a vegetarian) and half pepperoni. Ratios, more like 80-20 with the pepperoni basically all over the pizza, making it inedible for me. Was hungry so i tried a very small piece that didn't have pepperoni. Tasted like chemicals. Barely any cheese. Gross. My daughter (who will even eat MY cooking) couldn't even stomach a whole slice of the pepperoni. All of this and I got to cook it myself, too!! Yah, needless to say, never again."}
{"text":"Great service. Fast delicious food.  The ingredients always taste so fresh!  Will always go here from now on price is perfect compared to pizza places."}
{"text":"I have only been going to Papa Murphy's for a year and it's my favorite carryout pizza. I love the fact that the ingredients are fresh and you can bake it at home. I think the quality is way better than most of their competition. It's a much better value than a lot of places. The staff at this location is always very friendly and helpful. i've always had good service and it's always a good experience. I've gotten several of my neighbors hooked as well. This location is super clean and always looks neat and tidy."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally have a takeout pizza place with decent pizza that doesn't cost a fortune! I've been here 3 times and every time I've had great service and a great pizza. The ingredients taste fresh and the portions are very generous, and the sauce is quite tasty. Definitely worth the extra effort of picking it up and baking it."}
{"text":"I love this place, i was little skeptical at first because i had to take it home and cook it myself but the taste and the portion of the topping are so generous,, i normally dont like pizza at all but this pizza i can eat until im really really full lol, everyone should try this place at least once, you will not regret it, by the way the staff is super friendly very cute"}
{"text":"Love that they will customize your pizza for you from sauce to toppings.  Its take and bake.  They put a ton of topping on there for!  Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I want to note that the owner, Dennis, who posted his comment on my review, was genuinely concerned enough about my less than stellar experience to message me and offer me a complimentary pizza.


I thanked him for the follow up, but I declined. I don't want a free pizza.

I didn't pop in once, catch them on a bad day, then crucify them with a knee-jerk review.  I had been there several times on various days and at various times before I came to my conclusion and wrote a review. 

And my commentary speaks more to the entire concept than to the specific shortcoming of this particular chain or location. Other locations don't do it any better or worse...to their credit, I guess? 

I don't want a free pizza.  It won't change my mind.
I am not an unhappy customer-I just didn't like the food. 
It happens.
I stand by with \"Meh, I've experienced better\"
Because I have.

But props to Dennis for understanding that you can't make everyone happy, but you should at least try. Real class act.

No matter what #1 Zagat, now part of the Google monolith, says.
Cause based on sales, Pizza Hut is #1, and you literally couldn't PAY ME enough to eat that...expletive deleted."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza from this place.  It's cheaper and higher quality than Pizza Hut, dominos, or papa johns, but not as good as Rosatis.  I Get a large pan with pepperoni and a stuffed family size with pineapple, sausage, and jalepenos. It comes to $29. This mid-quality option is much appreciated- and the customer service is almost always really good."}
{"text":"Delicious gluten free pizza!!!!! Fresh ingredients and actually tastes like a real pizza!"}
{"text":"It's convenient and hot ( because I bake it) and cheap if you can catch a deal.  They hire kids that don't care much about the customers.  If your not a regular that they recognize, you might get treated ok... You might not.  Tonight, I ordered extra cheese as one of my 5 topping for $10 Tues. and barely got any cheese on my pizza.  While others walked out with their pizzas loaded.  I'm soooo done with this location.  The staff changes often & they need an adult ( manager or assistant) present during prime hours."}
{"text":"Great value, friendly staff, convenient location, what more could you want?

- 10 mins of raw pizza on the included tray, sitting on hot pizza stone.
- 10 mins directly on stone
- 2 mins broil

Pizza was great!!! Not greasy (but meaty), crust was perfect thickness and crispness.  I'd highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have no affiliation with this merchant but I did try one of their pizzas tonight and was very impressed. The pizza is sold uncooked and of course comes with easy baking instructions. What set it apart for me was a very generous portion of fresh ingredients. And a bonus is that you only pay 1.67% sales tax, the same as on grocery products. The owner's name is Doug."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Ready on time and just the way I ordered it. ¼ cheese for my boy, the rest the way I like it."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's got it right in every category! I cant think of a better pizza to pick up and take home! The pizza is delicious and best of all, you can design your pizza any way you want to meet the tastes of your family. I love all the fresh vegetables! My favorite pizza is black olives and mushrooms pizza on thin crust. The service is friendly, professional and quick. You are always greeted with a huge smile when you walk in the door.  Thanks for opening up a Papa Murphy's in Charlotte! My family loves it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Never again! It looks good but it tastes horrible! Nothing wrong with service, just think the company doesn't get the best ingredients."}
{"text":"Received a coupon for Papa Murphey's in the mail and ordered our pie. Walked in and they handed us a raw pizza covered in Saran Wrap. After looking at the pictures on yelp and their website, we expected a fully prepared pizza. Not an overpriced take and bake pile of ingredients. When I pay for a pizza at a restaurant, I do so because I don't want to bake something at home. If I wanted to mess up my kitchen I'd buy frozen for half the price. Not worth the waste of time or money for us."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! So happy to have one back on the west side! The pizza tastes good and bakes up so much better than those other take and bake pizzas from Walmart, Costco, etc. The staff is so very nice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The Mediterranean was my favorite until I tried the all meat, then that was my favorite until I tried the stuffed pizza. Each experience tops the last! With create your own and gluten free options, everyone in my family is happy!"}
{"text":"Definitely a different experience.

A lot of people coming from the North West states such as Washington will tell you how great it is for this store to finally open up somewhere nearby in the Scottsdale location.

I'm very biased when it comes to pizza.  But when I tried a pizza from here, baking at home, I got to say it was the very least ... freshest pizza I've had.  Quality ingredients, quality servings, and most importantly quality taste are the reasons why I come back for more.  Pricing is very reasonable for the product you are getting.  Definitely take this over any of the major corporate pizza chains."}
{"text":"I'm one of those annoying people you've met, who form a firm opinion about something without trying it and then, after being convinced to finally make a go of it after God-knows-how-long, not only changes their mind, but becomes a fan.

Papa Murphy's is no exception.  When they first came into existence, my attitude was that I wasn't going to pay them almost as much for an already cooked pizza, then take it home and do all the hard work heating it up.  Their propaganda that cooking it yourself makes it fresher and tastier was as convincing as FOX News claiming to present fair and balanced reporting.  

How very wrong I was.

It's worth to pay what you pay to take the pizza home and heat it up and exactly for the reasons they claim.  In addition, I have found that the veggie pizza is absolutely loaded with fresh veggies and enough cheese to give a mouse a heart attack from excitement.  The staff at this location is always friendly, gives helpful advice and is efficient and fast.  And not once, and I do mean, \"not once\", has any of the pizzas been a disappointment in any way  (except, maybe, to my waistline).

Hands down the best pizza in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Fresh and fast. No complaints from me. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good wheel in FH."}
{"text":"awsome pizza great coustomer service. I would recommend this place but get their early so you can get their homemade cheese bread it's out of this world."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the Sun Prairie location and is only a review on the service received, not the food. I have had Papa Murphy's pizza at other locations and the pizza was good. Unfortunately at this location I wasn't given a chance to get a pizza. I walked into the store at 5 minutes to 8pm. 8pm is when they close. Not only did my phone, my car, and my watch indicate that it was before 8pm but the actual clock inside the store was showing 7:55. I soon as I walked into the restaurant I was told that they were closed even though there was another customer in the store getting a pizza as well. You don't even bake the pizza! How much effort would it have been to take one more order and make one more pizza? The total transaction could have been done and it still probably wouldn't have been 8! It's not like the store had already been cleaned and it would have been a hassle to reopen everything. I would have been completely understanding of that. There are a lot of pizza options in sun prairie. Go there."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Generous toppings and delicious!  The staff is always very friendly, chatty and very genuine.  The last time I was in, we were talking about sauces and they told me they could make a pink sauce which is the red and white sauce mixed and suggested I try it.  From now on, I will always order my pizza with pink sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come here they are always super nice . We haven't tried a pizza that we didn't like . My personal favorite is the BBQ chicken :-)"}
{"text":"No better than frozen pizza. I kinda wonder if theirs dough actually comes to them frozen before they \"make\" it."}
{"text":"People are nice. So many different options. You can pick your own toppings and crust etc. Or you can get one of there popular ones. They make it in front of you. Only thing is, you have to take it home and make it. But so easy and fast."}
{"text":"Food quality is awesome. The staff is fast and always have a smile. This is our go to spot when I don't want to cook. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"No one could be more skeptical about this joint then me
In fact when they first opened up I actually walked in took a look
And told the employees there that 1. I didn't want anything just 
looking and 2. This place won't last 6 months. What a jerk!

Ok THE BIG DEAL IS ITS TAKE AND BAKE meaning 
It's not cooked yet that's why I told them it wouldn't last
So if you don't have an oven or you don't know how to turn one
On DONT GO HERE

Well 2 years after the fact I got some coupons in the mail 
And gave it a day in court 
I got a Stuffed Chicago Style pizza and let's just say 
I ate my words literally its a lot of pizza and a lot of dough
For a good price (check out Tuesday deals) 
If you don't like a lot of bread don't get it

Ok I get the same thing every time so if you decide to 
Go and get something else off the menu it's on you"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a good pizza. It's good that they make it fresh for you to take home to bake. Bakes perfect all the time."}
{"text":"Such great people work at this Papa Murphy's! Word of advice: there are actually TWO Papa Murphy's stores oh Ray Rd. I accidentally ordered for the wrong store, but went to this store to pick it up. The kind people here remade me the same order and said they would call the other store to cancel the order there. I felt so bad, but they were so great about it. As always, the pizza itself was amazing."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphys Pizza ! This location has excellent service, cheerful employees and perfect pizza every time !"}
{"text":"You are always pleasantly greeted when you first walk in. I really enjoy the garlic chicken pizza and my kids are fans of the pepperoni or sausage pizza (depending on the day). Staff always ask if you have any questions about baking the pizza before you leave and everything is made within minutes. Priced well, but only after using their coupons."}
{"text":"We normally love Papa Murphy's. We were thrilled one opened 2 miles from our house. Sadly this location is extremely greasy and just doesn't taste the same. We've ordered from them 6 times and never got a good pizza. My husband and I will continue to go the location on Craig and Decatur or the location on Losee."}
{"text":"The best thin crust pizza ever and fast when you order a head.  Love the cowboy and other delights.  Much better and half the price of the competition that bakes it.   Hard on the AC in the summer."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!

I came in at 730 pm today and i can honestly say this was the WORST experience as a regular that comes in frequent once a week. My wife is specifically allergic to tomatoes. The cashier that helped me was completely nice and understanding about the situation. she told me that she needed to grab the shift leader to fix a minor mistake to my bill.I told her it was not a problem. The Shift leader named \"ALEXIS\" came out and proceeded to make my pizza i had noticed the garlic sauce was running low but also had tomato pizza sauce mixed in with it so i commented about it and told her. She proceeded to say its fine it happens all the time. *****(side note people! that's considered  CROSS CONTAMINATION!!!!!!******) For someone that is with someone or has a family member with an allergy to tomatoes or any allergy for the matter that is NOT \"Fine\" Its a matter of life in death with theses type of allergies. I stayed quiet about it but this is where it really took toll. After saucing the pizza she proceeded to put tomatoes over it and thats where i had to draw the line. How can this person that is a so called \"Shift lead\" not be further educated in proper basic food handling procedures and also allergy  awareness? I then told her that i had requested no tomatoes on my pizza she then rudely rolls her eyes and lets out a big sigh in frustration and grumbled ill make you another one. (sorry im a customer right?) It had only escalated from there.... she came back with fresh dough then i assuming since she messed up the sauce the first time she would go ahead and just get a new batch? HA i was wrong she re- sauced the pizza with the same no good sauce i had just told her about. It truly saddens me to see what how uneducated this generation has become especially that one specific Shift Lead named ALEXIS, but then again who am i to judge this person being a shift leader at a pizza joint is the best job she can get. So unless you want your kids with allergies to get sick or possibly worse please come into this location because cross contamination, rudeness is a standard and is \"FINE\" to them. So in my response to this situation i am writing this yelp review to further educate uneducated people like that shift leader(i know shes gonna read this ;)  ) , Let other yelpers know the danger of coming to this location and also to say that i reported a complaint to AZ environmental health services so unless you guys step it up soon. There will be a health inspector coming into say hi in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Didn't realize they make your pizza fresh, yet don't cook it. I thought the wait was unusually long for it not being cooked, but over all the pizza was good. You must try their desserts!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when you can get exactly what you want!    Hubby loves the pizza more than me...but with the specials..you can't go wrong.
There's a large assortment of choices...and good service, but it's wise to watch what they are doing also they don't make any errors."}
{"text":"Great experience everytime I go staff is so nice and always give me the best deals on pizza and sides. 
Great pizza at a reasonable price. Better than any pizza  joint I know great job Papa Murphys. I will recommend you and great pizza."}
{"text":"I have always recommended Papa Murphy's pizza. This store on Union Hills and 32nd St. is usually pretty good. There was however one small incident where there was a price difference that we were not sure about. The acting manager at that time was Nicole who has a very condescending tone in her voice. 
My roommate didn't want to go back to this location ever again but I talked her into it. The staff at the store is usually very nice but two times we came back they mentioned the incident it was obviously jotted down in their system. This last time we came back Nicole was there, she actually said this experience was a little better than our last one. As a manager why would you bring up a negative experience from A month and a half ago? She exhibits no customer service skills at all."}
{"text":"Pizza in the CU seems to be an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.

Stepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. 

One of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.

Maybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.

So, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's."}
{"text":"Tasteless! I am surprised how tasteless the pizza and salad was.
Very disappointing and I would attempt again.
The salad was tasteless as well no flavor and dressing was a JOKE in a plastic pack.

What a shame!!"}
{"text":"First time there tonight. The customer service was less than thrilling and they wouldn't help us find a deal so we could order more food. We would have ended up buying bread sticks and soda, but they were so rude that we only got the pizza. However, the pizza is very tasty. I still don't think we'll be going back, though."}
{"text":"We had never tried a Papa Murphy's before, and, since we do NOT like Papa John's pizza or his politics, we were a bit reluctant (I know, entirely different company but the name is similar).  But then I saw a bunch of people had posted online how good Papa Murphy's is, so we tried them.  This is awesome pizza!

The Centennial location is new, and is still working out a few details (online ordering wasn't exactly as smooth as it should have been).  But even after having to wait a little longer for our pie, we were rewarded with a fabulous pizza.  And they have text specials that are incredibly good deals, when they happen.  

To the nay-sayers who think there's no need for another pizza place in the area, I remind you this is TAKE-AND-BAKE pizza only, a whole different animal in the pizza world.  

Also not to be missed is their s'mores dessert pizza, which for s'mores lovers, is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, the guys were fast and great, joked with my kids, which helped as we waited for the order to be ready. Good service good price, probably our new pizza place for our quick dinner needs!"}
{"text":"Ok...I'll jump in here....
A very friendly staff.....fast and efficient....We've been several times and never been disappointed...."}
{"text":"Seem to never get a good pizza from here. I like the idea and their Custer service is good but never have had a good piZa from there."}
{"text":"3 stars for good customer service and that's about it. If you're from the east coast and are sitting there thinking \"maybe I could bake this pizza longer and it will be crispy with a fusion of cheese/crust like back home\" don't get your hopes up. PM pizza is equal quality to grocery store take and bake but a better experience because you choose your ingredients."}
{"text":"Had my first pizza from PM today. It was thin crust and very good.
I was pleasantly surprised. I will see if they have these in Missouri. Definitely will buy again. Lots of quality ingredients, though the cheese was a bit sparse for my liking. Just a note, my parents don't get out much due to age. But when they do, they order a pie from PM and enjoy it. So easy, less work and cleanup after."}
{"text":"No Yellow Cheese!! Keep it off, is convenient easy to bake & eat fresh, just don't add yellow cheese. 
Pizza should have the right type of cheese, melted not chewy."}
{"text":"I must admit I hate the concept, but man is that pizza good.  I will be back"}
{"text":"We love this place for quick pizza.  It is always fresh, consistent, and tasty. Salads are also good.  A welcome break from the pricy pizza joints in the area. Yet, we don't feel we sacrifice on taste when we choose this pizza. It's also nice to just bake quickly at home and have hot, non-soggy pizza, instead of the sog  that occurs after delivery or pick-up when ordering pizza from other places to take home."}
{"text":"Solid pizza for the price.  Better than the delivery options of chain restaurants.  Workers were efficient and friendly.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow...I wish I would have tried their pizza sooner.  Being from NY I am a pizza snob,  I have to admit it.  However, my husband and I decided to try a take and bake from Papa Murphy's and it was Delicious!!   Now we bring home pizzas from there all of the time!   No matter what kind of pizza we order, it is great every time.  The ingredients seem so fresh and are very flavorful.  I definitely recommend Papa Murphy's to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love papa murphy's . Can't get a better pizza for your money. Yes, you do have to bake it but they use all fresh ingredients and don't skimp on them. Definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"I've heard a couple of good comments about this pizza so I finally gave it a try. 

It's really good and convenient at a really fair price. I was reluctant to the \"cook it yourself\" approach but it's stupid-proof, it comes with directions and you can call them if something goes wrong (it didn't in my case :) 

It comes in a paper tray oven friendly and I intentionally overcooked it a little bit so it came out crunchy and with a great taste.

An instant favorite!"}
{"text":"1st time buying from this place & def going back. Artichoke chicken bacon pizza is yums!!! REAL GOOD STUFF! Smells sooo good even before it's cooked! LOL! Workers was very nice.  Place is kept clean.  I always get their coupons in the mail & the one time I go, didn't bring the coupons. Ugh! Still a reasonable price tho.  $13 for the family size.  HUGE! Kinda craving for the pizza now as i'm reviewing this... OMG. =)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Chicken bacon stuffed pizza is my husbands favorite! Thin crust artichoke chicken is awesome!!Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 for flavor and service! It looses 1 star for not posting their hours anywhere online and even when you call there is no answering machine. That seems really backwards to me and annoying, you also can't order online. In this day and age that is crucial. They do make an excellent Pizza when ever they do decide to open which seems like between 11am and 11:30 or when ever they get around to it I guess."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Try the Cowboy or Herb Chicken Mediterranean. You can't get any more fresh than pulling it right out of your own oven. Super quality ingredients too, you can really tell. Great for me and my wife, plus leftovers the next day. The shop is always clean and the service is quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So glad there is one by the house now. Love their pizza!! Prices are great also .. People are friendly here and service is fast!!"}
{"text":"The manager that wouldn't provide me with her DM business card is rude and she straight up told me, I know what it says! When it came down to them no longer receiving the stamp club card. Then she called her boss on her cell phone instead of the business phone and then her boss didn't bother to contact me about the complaint. The are all stuck up and rude. I believe her name was Alexis  (so it says on the receipt). After coming back to this location after several months, I will never go back again"}
{"text":"Great little place we found by accident. I was looking to make a pizza to grill and stumbled upon the Papa Murphy name. I was even more surprised to find there was a location down the street. We have made 3 visits now, meeting the owner on the most recent. Very clean, friendly staff, plenty of choices BUT the pizza is amazing, made to order with fresh ingredients. My wife loves the fact they will put her special toppings only on the slice or 2 she will eat while the rest of the family can make it their way. We love our on the grill!"}
{"text":"So stopped at Papa Murphy's on way home from baseball.  (Hualapi and Trop)  Had coupon for buy family pizza get a medium free from a fundraiser coupon book that had address on it.  Ordered it, paid.  Next thing I know lady coming about from back scolding at me about food cost and stuff.  Lol.  Like I made the coupon.  So your going to give me a hard time AND make me cook it myself.  Haha.  Took refund.  Adios!  Some people shouldnt be running a business.  Pizza looked crappy too.  Dont get that business model."}
{"text":"Love it so easy to bake I put mine in the broiler for the last  2 mins"}
{"text":"When I first walked into the store the first employee we encountered did not attempt to greet us, but rather asked what we wanted. We asked the employee to give us a few seconds and he proceeded to the back of the store without saying a thing. Another employee by the name of Todd walks up, so we gave our order and proceeded to pay for the total. Instead of receiving exceptional customer service, Todd yanked my debit card from my hand and threw it across the counter just after swiping the card. This wasn't the only time Todd expressed attitude, when he was done preparing our pizza he threw the pie across the countertop. This little incident was enough for me to persuade friends and family not to pay for such horrible customer service. I've already contacted corporate office regarding store 03049 regarding this incident."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza over the phone, totally unaware that I would have to cook it myself! A little heads up would have been nice. Also the pizza is terrible.  The crust is burned and the middle is soggy. Never again."}
{"text":"I think this Papa Murphy's location does a fine job IF you can go when it's not really busy. I see a lot of complaints about the employees but I have always found them to be nice, albeit young and inexperienced. They're learning.
My pizza is good from here 9 times out of 10 and that's what really matters. The one time I had a major issue (waited a half hour past the time I was told my pizza would be ready) the owner made it right with me. I think this location is improving with time."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but expect to wait and clear your calendar if your going to wait for a pizza. If someone had two broken legs and two broken hands they could probably make a pizza faster. It's incredibly ridiculous. Only reason I left two stars is because the food is good."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, the dough taste like home
Made pizza.. Always fresh ingredients and ready to put in the oven"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an amazing group of people that work at this location!!  I went in last night, so late!! It was like 15 till close, I hate people like me and I even told them that!! They were so nice and welcoming!! As always the pizza was delicious with an abundance of toppings!!! Love this spot!!!"}
{"text":"As far as fast pizza goes, I really like Papa Murphy's. This one even has a drive thru so you can call ahead and just pull up to the window. The staff is friendly and the store is clean. You can go inside and watch them build your pie.
I really like that I can pick up a pizza and cook it when I'M ready instead of waiting for delivery or having it sit and get cold. 
The ingredients are good quality and they always have coupons online, making it a very affordable option when you need something quick."}
{"text":"We love this location simply because of the owners. A sweet older couple with all sorts of kindness are usually seen here busting their butts to make their customers happy. 

Each time we have stopped in or called ahead we have been in and out Carly quickly. The pizzas always look great and taste wonderful. The hand pulled thin is amazing! They have tons of toppings and you can also get garlic bread, salad, or a dessert! 

Nice location and very clean."}
{"text":"Look like there was only one worker which was fine being they dont get too busy . Walked in was not greeted with a welcome to papa murphys r a hello r anything . Then when paying he almost handed me extra change ($2)but caught himself beforehand unfortunately then tried to cheat me outta a buck handing me 7 when i was owed 8 . Then have the nerve to say \" i woulda caught on it \" like sure ya woulda . But i ordered thee chicken bacon artichoke and it was exceptionally good"}
{"text":"OMG why aren't there more reviews for this awesome place? The pizza is fresh, and has tasty ingredients, and for the value you cold order 2 pizzas and be fine for the week to live off of. This place rocks. Great concept."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. its about half the price of papajohns or pizzahut ( eww ) and it tastes a lot fresher too. They are always sending out coupons so I can feed a family of 6 for about 20 bucks. The older gentlemen who works here is so nice! But the younger gentlemen always act like im bothering them when I order, they never say hello or anything. But other than that I love this place."}
{"text":"We got a coupon for a free pizza in the mail because we live nearby, so we thought we'd check them out! I'm really glad we did!

Being about 3 mins from our apartment, this may be our new go-to pizza joint. I have no problem throwing a pizza in the oven to cook--because let's be honest, it's really the preparing part we're too lazy to do!

The flavors were great, and the ingredients tasted fresh. What I'm most excited about, though, is they have fresh dough that you can buy and take home!"}
{"text":"Though technically this is a chain/franchise and the product is standardized, their pizza is actually a very good value and good quality for the price. Yes, you have to bake it at home, but I think that the end result is better than take-out, delivery or frozen because you can enjoy the pizza hot-out the oven. Combined with any promotions or coupons thru the mail, you get twice as much for your money compared to eating out. With leftover pizza, this or any other, wrap in foil while still warm, then freeze (not refrigerate). You can microwave or pop into a toaster oven and enjoy better leftovers than if you leave in the fridge."}
{"text":"Take and Bake.  Yes, that sums it up.  They make them fresh you take them home and cook them.  I have had some that are wonderful and then I have had some that are not so good.  The crust is pretty consistent but the sauce is not.  Sometimes I taste something that reminds me of hay or straw.  I can't put my finger on it but it's something that I do not care for.  Other times the sauce is just fine so I am not sure if they used one of the other sauces for certain pizzas or how it works.

Last night I was at a friends house and she had ordered an \"adult pizza\".  It was Halloween so they had numerous pumpkin pizzas for the kids, which were cute by the way.  The \"adult pizza\" had a thinner crust (more like a tortilla) with a garlic based sauce and I think perhaps more garlic on top of garlic.  It was overwhelmingly garlicky.  Way too much garlic in this one for my liking.  I dipped it in the pizza sauce that came with the garlic bread and that toned it down some.  Also on this pizza was spinach, chicken, roasted tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Other people really liked it but I can honestly say I would never order it.  It's just not a pizza.

My overall opinion is I would stick to a normal pizza when ordering from here.  And by normal I mean red pizza sauce, sausage, mozzarella cheese etc."}
{"text":"Thrilled to see a Papa Murphy's closer to ASU! 

Custom pizzas and salad for a great price! Loved that the salads are made to order instead of sitting on ice. 

Cowboy is my favorite if you aren't sure what to try!"}
{"text":"I probably go here twice a month and have always had a good experience. For once in my life I didn't have a coupon in hand so I found one online. The cashier said \"if you find one online and show it to me then I can apply it.\" I pulled it up and showed it to her just like she asked and then she told me I had to order it online. Being that she's probably 16 years old, she likely hasn't realized the importance of customer service so I hope that someone educates her at some point. It's common knowledge that Papa Murphy's has endless coupons so it's not that I was trying to capitalize on some exclusive offer so I'm perplexed why she wasn't able to apply the offer - especially when she specifically asked to see it on my phone. What a disappointing experience, at least Babbo is next door so I can divert my business there when I want Italian."}
{"text":"It's pretty good pizza...We got the stuffed 5 meat...$14 no tax...Not bad, hope you calculate your stove time's properly...If your hungry make sure you pre heat your oven before you pick up the pie...I am not sure why they aren't cooking these pizza's...at least offer you a \"choice\"...

It's like selling tire's without putting on the rims...Go figure..."}
{"text":"Great pizza that you take and bake at home. Fresh ingredients that are weighed out in front of you as they prepare the pizza. I like that I can get the pizza early in the day and then take it home and bake later.  Great price for a family."}
{"text":"As newbies to the area we had to try this pizza place with such an interesting concept. We picked our pizzas, one thin crust and one stuffed, as well as picked up a cinnamon wheel for dessert. I can agree with other posts that, although interesting, it seems odd to pay for a pizza that I had to pick up and then bake at home when I could have had a pizza (or two even!) delivered to my door for the price of one. The nice part is the freshly made pizza and toppings assembled right in front of you as well as the very courteous service in the shop. The pizza itself was decent and tasted good but we felt that it wasn't really anything special. It's a good place to go if you happen to be nearby and want to pick up a pizza for later....not when you're already hungry, of course. And so you don't feel like you should have just ordered delivery from one of the major pizza chains for the same price, make sure to use a coupon to get the best deal!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza at an extremely reasonable price! The specialty pizzas are all terrific, but you can also craft your own! Want a pepperoni pizza with one slice cheese only? Done! Order it the way YOU want it! Also, don't forget the chocolate chip cookie dough. I hear it makes good cookies- I just dive in with a spoon! 
Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Papa Murphy's pizza and the concept of taking the pizza home to bake in your own oven to have it nice and warm!

We had PM pizza before at a super bowl party and thought the selection was great.  We decided to check out a location near us a couple weeks ago on a Wednesday.  We thought we did not need to call ahead, I mean how long could it take to just throw some toppings on a pizza to hand to us to take home to bake??  Well we were wrong, it took nearly 25-30 minutes just to wait for one pizza.  They were clearly understaffed and busy that night, hopefully it will not take this long again, but to take as long as it does to pick up a cooked pizza is not the way to do things Papa Muphy's!

On to the pizza.  We got a large spicy fennel sausage gourmet delite pizza.  This pizza is a thin crust pizza with garlic sauce, spicy sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan.  The aroma in the house when cooking this pizza was fabulous.  It only took about 15 or so minutes to bake.  We really liked the flavor of this one and would get it again.

I think we will be back as we do like the flavor of their pizza, but hopefully their wait time is fixed the next time we go or we may have to just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't review fast food places.. but this is one of those establishments that I need to review because of their outstanding product and i am not alone in this opinion. i first discovered this franchise in Alaska, and then everywhere else. It is plainly good pizza - but the secret is quality AND quantity. Their stuffed pizzas run 4+ lbs (terrible measuring system invented by imperialistic invaders and lingers in our society like a bad fart), and if you make that a family size then you'll come home with a 5+ lbs pizza pie that will feed you amazingly aggressively and violate your diet restrictions so hard and send you on the express train to obesity..

.. but its good, oh-so good. And you can buy it early, store in fridge and unleash flavorgeddon in your own oven when you feel the need. That is why I use this franchise.

And this particular store is great because of the mood. The shift manager (I assume) is the happiest guy you meet, and he is quick, witty and happy. That's another plus. try this pizza. They deserve it, and go big - go stuffed, but don't under-cook it."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the pizza here. We ordered the stuffed pizza. And while it was as overall tasty, there was something about it that just didn't taste right. I can't put my finger on if it's the dough, or the sauce, but it doesn't taste fresh. It tastes a little bit bland. The stuffed pizza does take about 35 mins to bake. So if you're in a hurry or don't want to wait to eat, I wouldn't recommend it. It wasn't awful, but I don't know that this will be my go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Papa Murphy's in the area.  Folks here are courteous and good at making the full pizzas that are not missing toppings."}
{"text":"Why is that the Aliante store just up and decided to close early on a Saturday night? 10 minutes before the posted time! You just lost customers over 10 measly minutes. How sad."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! I love to order and take home to bake it and eat while its hot and fresh! Who wouldnt lol. Friendly staff is not afraid to pile on the toppings too. Recently opened early 2016"}
{"text":"Love papa murphys pizza. Never really have any issues. But this location seems to not listen to you at all. Last couple of time I was there for a $7 pizza from their text coupons. And both times the person at the register said the $7 coupon and still charged me full price!! Good thing I caught it both times."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Super fresh pizza! Great customer service! Friendly staff! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"So not too many like a take and bake but i have come to love it.  nothing like eating a fresh pizza out of the oven.  These guys are always so friendly when i go and I love that the place is clean.  i am a picky eater so i have tons of special request and that only excites the staff.  when i went there the other day they were playing Asking Alexandra on the radio.  now that may offend some but it put a smile onmy face to see the young adults staying motivated on a slow day.  The only pizza i dont care for is the chicken thai with sweet sauce and ground hamburger."}
{"text":"I love papa murphs, but both times I have been to this location I have been severely disappointed. The first time, I walked in and it took a few minutes before the kids stopped their conversation behind the counter to actually help me. 
Today, I ordered a pizza and it took 30 minutes for them to make it because only one person was staffed.
Horrible!  I will be going somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"this is a real \"woohoo.\"  that pizza is delicious, it's cheap as heck, and okay, are you SO lazy you can't pick up a raw pizza and cook it yourself? i found the sausage pizza/red sauce a bit salty, but the veggie is unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Employees are always friendly, store is always clean and food is always cheap. 

This is a take and bake pizza place so you will be cooking this stuff once you get home. My only gripe is that the pizzas never seem to turn out the same. Sometimes we can get them perfect but other times they are either burnt or undercooked. The last pizza we got from them the center just would not cook until the outer part was burnt. 

Overall though I like this place and will return."}
{"text":"The pizza and staff are amazing :) I had the pleasure of meeting the owner he was friendly and down to earth great business and great pizza :)"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had, the chicken bacon artichoke delight is to die for.
The staff there is already friendly , fast and the place is clean."}
{"text":"If you don't mind cooking your own pizza, this place is great!  Fresh ingredients and a nice staff.  I believe on Tuesday you can order any type of pizza that you want for $10."}
{"text":"This is the last one left in Vegas. There used to be several, but they all went away.  For the money, a great place to pick up a fresh pizza for a family dinner or a casual night with friends.  Mind you, you have to bake it yourself, but that's not an inconvenience for a pizza this good."}
{"text":"This place is good and I usually like eating here but this evening I went in I saw a girl take change with their gloves on put it in the drawer handle other money. then go back to the line without changing her gloves. I immediately left I did not feel comfortable imagine all the things they made a touch that money on my pizza thinking about it makes me sick. When I talk to on the employees about it they didn't seem too urgent to take care of issue."}
{"text":"Just stopped by there to order a pizza for dinner tonight.  Hopefully, our next experience will be better, but this one was not good.  The young man at the register was just plain rude in the  both the tone and words he used to answer my question.   I asked for a family size pizza, half cheese and half vegetarian minus olives and mushrooms.  He pointed over to the board to our left on the wall and said \"The toppings are on there.  Tell me what you want and I'll add them.\"  I repeated my inquiry - Same reply.  I looked at the board, saw the name of the vegetarian pizza, named that  xxxx vegetarian pizza again minus the olives and mushrooms and that seemed to do it.

A better response would have been \"Our xxxxx vegetarian comes with yyyy ingredients.  Would you like to add or subtract from the list\".  Or course, said response should have been said with a pleasant tone and a smile."}
{"text":"It happened again. I place my order and ask about breadsticks since there were none in the cooler .  The employees reply was that they were out and would have some tomorrow. I paid for my order and called the store while at the counter and ordered breadsticks and the reply was they would be ready in five minutes. I asked him if he could see me waiving my hand at him and why he told me they were out till tomorrow. It was a great look he gave me..."}
{"text":"I never really understood the idea of a take-n-bake.  I believed it was just a fresher version of the frozen pizza.  A pizza I was doomed to undercook or worse yet....burn.  Up until today, I thought who better to bake a pizza pie than the pizza pie professionals.

The GF came across some coupons for Papa Murphy's and suggested we order.  After a week of some what clean eating and listening to her telling me the pizza was good, I thought I would give it a shot.

We ordered up two pizzas about an hour before we were going to pick them up.  The first pie was the Angus Steak & Roasted Garlic on a thin crust.  The second was called \"Cowboy\" on an original crust.  This was a more traditional pie consisting of red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and olives.

When we made our way to the shop, we were greeted coming through the door.  The remainder of the experience was friendly enough.  The purchase of your take-n-bake was efficient enough.  Out the door we went with two cellophane wrapped dough disks; each one looked like a thawed out version of a frozen pizza I was sure to F-up in the very near future.

When we got home the GF assumed the the role of an amateur pizza baker.  It seemed to me the longest part of waiting for our meal was preheating the oven.

When these gems were pulled from the oven, they took on a very different appearance from other pizza delivery joints.  These things looked fresh....they radiated freshness.  They smelled fresh.  Best of all, they tasted fresh.  I proceeded to devour as many pieces I could.  It was pure pizza joy.  I quickly became pizza drunk on angus steak and pepperoni.  Take-n-bake is good to go and I will be back again....but only if the GF is going to do the baking."}
{"text":"Aly and nicole made my Christmas eve the chair they brought even though and they were working on Christmas Eve was amazing I would recommend going Papa Murphy's to anyone thank you Ali and thank you Nicole you girls are awesome"}
{"text":"Have this restaurant another shot and glad we did.  Everyone enjoyed the pizza and the quality was great. Great that's and ingredients."}
{"text":"I love these stores.  I have been to many.  GREAT options for pizza.  Take it home, bake it yourself.  Hot and fresh out of the oven. 

This was a newer location.  Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction. 

And they have some new menu options. 

Try it.  You won't order delivery again."}
{"text":"Good pizza"}
{"text":"Jarod and staff are really friendly! They took into consideration a mushroom allergy that I had and were really nice about it!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza! They are super friendly and fast. These pizzas are made with fresh ingredients, nothing is pulled out of a freezer, so they taste amazing! The cookie dough and dessert pizzas are also delicious. They correct any mistakes quickly and make sure that you are happy. This is my go to pizza place because pulling this out of your own oven in just 12 minutes is better, in my opinion, than waiting around 15-20 minutes for a greasy previously frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good service and the pizza is a great value.  We are happy with this location."}
{"text":"I have never tried Papa Murphys before and saw this brand new location on my way home and decided to give it a go. I walked into a clean restaurant, and was welcomed with smiles by every one on the crew. Scott the manager was very nice and upsold me with cookie dough and a cinnamon pizza good deal. Scott picked up that it was my first time and explained the cooking directions for everything. Pizza was ready quick. Took it home and it was delicious. I had a thin crust spinach and cheese with garlic sauce and it was pretty darn yummy. I gave them a five because the entire crew tried to make my experience a good one and I appreciate good service and good food. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Not really love at 425 degrees. It's just ok. I probably wouldn't go back. We decided to give them a try and carry out a pre-made pepperoni pizza and bake at home to see what all the hype was about. The pizza baked up fine: cheese melted with a golden crust. After the first bite, I knew the cheese was not fresh, it is probably pre-grated with corn starch added before it gets to their location.  It melted weird and was stringy.  Actually, my son choked on his cheese. The crust was nothing special either. We will stick with Papa John's for fast pizza."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Kid kept making the comment of \"Oh I lied\" when he'd make a mistake instead of saying \"oops I was incorrect or sorry I was wrong\" when he was working with the customers that were ahead of me in line & also said it to me as well. That's not a very smart thing to say when you're dealing with customers where you're trying to build a rapport with them. Then he proceeded to overcharge me & I caught it after the credit card was already swiped. He didn't know how to do a return so had to call the manager who was already gone for the evening. Finally after dilly dallying he got the refund made. I asked for his name in case the refund didn't show up on my credit card bill & he wrote it down on the credit card receipt I had to sign for the store to keep. When I mentioned \"isn't that the paper you're keeping?\" he was like \"oh yeah.\" Watched the other employee weigh the cheese & ingredients out on the pizza for the customers ahead of me then proceed to knock a good portion of the ingredients off as he moved the pizza down the counter. So the customers ahead of me did not get the allotted amount of cheese & sausage they should have on their pizza. Both employees need to take a customer service training class & get their head on their shoulders & not act like ding bats. Taco pizza I ordered was gross as well. Wouldn't ever get it again. I will go to other locations that are further away from me rather than go back here. I do like Papa Murphy's pizza as I've tried other ones in the past just did not like the taco one."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, especially their artichoke chicken bacon pizza. The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly. They have a lot of good deals and coupons. I usually buy several and freeze them and then I can have their pizza any time I want."}
{"text":"I came in and picked up a large pan pizza with pepperoni. The cookie dough tempted me so I added on some of that and some thick cheesy bread. The girl at the register also made my pizza and she made it fresh in front of me and asked me if it looked alright which I did. My wife baked the pizza, cheesy bread, and chocolate chip cookies and it all came out good. The pan pizza was nice and thick but the bottom got a little black from the oil or butter under the pizza. If you bake the pan pizza make sure and check it after 10  minutes. The thicker cheesy bread they now have is something my wife said she could just eat as a meal by themselves. The cheesy bead was a big hit."}
{"text":"Gloves are now worn by the staff and no one has coughed on our food recently BUT my wife went in there a week or so ago to place an order for pizza and cheese bread. Upon seeing no cheese bread in the cooler she inquired about the availability and was told they were out.  When she arrived back to our car sans the cheese bread I called the store and placed an order and was told it would be ready in a minute.  I asked the manager why he can make one up for me but not offer to do so for my wife when she placed her order.  I was met with slack jawed silence and then told an excuse about the dough not being ready when she was in.  Pretty dumb excuse being there was less than a 3 minute time lapse from the time my wife was told they 'were out' and my order but I didn't press the point.  At lease he offered to give me the bread for free...."}
{"text":"Clean store kind of hidden excellent customer service they even gave me a coupon for my order. My order was finished before quoted time to come pick up."}
{"text":"I LOVE Papa Murphy's pizza so if you don't care about service then this is the place to go.  Really, really tasty pizza.  That said, both times I've gone the people do not even say hello to you and seem really mad to be at work.  I've noticed other people on here have said that too.  It's really a grumpy sort of business to go into."}
{"text":"Picked up a heart shaped pizza and it was decent. It was like $7 or something and you bake the pizzas at home yourself. It comes with instructions and clean up is a snap. The pizza isn't award winning but it's good enough for a \"take & bake\" place. They have cookie dough for sale and garlic bread too. The lobby inside is huge and seems like wasted space. Call ahead your order if you know what you want or walk in and have them make it in front of you. Either way it's up to you to bake it."}
{"text":"Easy order, easy instructions, and great pizza. Lots of toppings and good crust too. Awesome"}
{"text":"Employees here are young and always polite. Quiet little establishment, but I'm pretty sure all Papa Murphy's are. They've unfortunately got rid of their punch-card frequent buyer program, but were cool enough to honor us with a discount for our old cards. Put together in front of you using always fresh ingredients, so if the pizza comes out wrong it's on us, the chefs."}
{"text":"I recommend the bacon chicken artichoke and the garden veggie.  Delicious! Take and bake at 425 F."}
{"text":"The location was clean and the service was great. The quality leaves something to be desired but its not awful. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Loved... even my picky teenagers loved your Jack-O-Lantern pizza.  New go to pizza spot"}
{"text":"Passed by this place for the first time today and they had a table set out with samples. My bf noticed the samples and pointed to them. The young girl outside noticed him and literally ran over to our car to give us samples. Great customer service and we weren't even customers. Give her a raise! And the pizza was GOOD!

We didn't have time to get a pizza today but I will definitely be back to get one. I would have never tried this pizza place otherwise."}
{"text":"Bought family size pepperoni and cheese with extra cheese.. Waited 8mins.. which is fine. I saw the pizza and it looked regular and not so tidy. I asked if it was with extra cheese.  Big yes but this is not 1st time I had this before. It looked even less cheese than without extra cheese. Not so happy."}
{"text":"This is our go to chain when we are doing a family pizza night and want quality pizza, but don't want to break the bank. The shop is located inside of the Albertson's shopping plaza on College Dr. I suggest calling ahead because it does get pretty busy in the evenings and on the weekends. Although, even without calling it in the wait isn't too bad (10 minutes). They have a great selection of pizza toppings and something to satisfy everyone; wether you are a meat lover, veggie lover, on a diet, or somewhere in between. The customer service is always friendly and accommodating and seem to enjoy their job.

We usually get about 3 large pizzas: The Cowboy (heavy on the meats with pepperoni and sausage) for boyfriend's dad and brother, Herb Chicken Mediterranean deLITE (more for the diet conscious it consists of cracker thin crust and herb chicken, spinach, tomatoes, feta, olive oil) for boyfriend's mom and sister in law, and boyfriend and I opt for the Gourmet Chicken Garlic with thin crust (creamy garlic sauce, chicken, tomatoes, green onions, herbs & cheese). Once you get home you just pop it in the oven for a bit and you're set with a hot and fresh delicious pizza. They send you home with the cooking instructions, but basically it's 12-18 minutes at 425 degrees and make sure to check it at ten minute mark. Simple enough. The prices are around $10-16 per pizza depending on the size and choice of pizza.

The only downfall is waiting for the deliciousness to finish baking when starving!"}
{"text":"I am becoming a regular now!  :) I love their pizza and they really take customer service seriously!  I pay attention to things like that and every time I come to this location they make me feel special!  I always leave in a good mood and I still have hot, fresh, delicious pizza to look forward to when I get home! I love their pepperoni and sausage, my personal favorite.  But they also have many other delicious options.  There's a chicken, spinach alfredo (i think it was) that I never would have tried because I am picky and it sounds strange but it was actually delicious! My kids are huge fans too!  It's always a special night when we stop by Papa Murphy's!  :)"}
{"text":"My family highly recommended we try this pizza when we moved here since they order from here often. We finally tried it and must admit its a favorite and the pizzas are Excellent.  Happy Valley location has a snippy female employee who must have missed her customer service training, but if you can get past her attitude, its worth the good food."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Papa Murphy's and have been ordering from a chain restaurant instead, SHAME ON YOU! I won't say that this is the best pizza I've ever had, but I'll swear that this is the best you'll get at this price point- I got a large stuffed pizza for an awesome $11. 

The employees were really nice; I'd never been and was encouraged to ask questions like where the sauce was on the stuffed pizza (it comes inside and on the top). The woman in front of me had a Mediterranean (olive oil, feta cheese, spinach, herbs, olives, chicken..) pizza that looked tasty- I'll probably try that next time. 

Text Go Papa to 90210 to get a free 2 liter OR cookie dough on your same-day visit. And there are more coupons on the back of the cooking instructions when you leave them feedback. 

If you're one of those, like my dad, who believe all reputable pizza places offer anchovies, they have them for you. We used to be huge fans of the Pizza Hut pan pizza.. no more!"}

{"text":"Why is it that you find a cool place, makes Pizza, you bake it.. start to like it then the customer service heads south, the employees get lax and then you don't like it any more.  

I love to get a pizza on Tuesdays..  but the last few time that I went is was painful.  Customer service needs a kick in the but.  Employees hanging out talking on cell phones in back then coming up to make a pizza without washing their hands..  you know your phone is dirtier than a toilet AND health code says you have to wash your hands before putting on cloves.

I will give this place a couple of more tries... Please fix it."}
{"text":"Go here on Tuesdays. A large pizza with as many toppings as you want is only 10$. The thin crust is pretty good, but I don't like the cracker pizza bones. The stuffed pizza is pretty intense, and I've never had much luck getting it to cook properly. I prefer the pan pizza. It's definitely greasier, but the crust as a good flavor."}
{"text":"Having a get together tomorrow. Saw their taco pizza special on the news this morning so called tonight to order 2.  Also have the Save Around coupon book purchased as a fundraiser from Coyote Hills Elementary School good through 2018.  Called before ordering to see if we could order the special and use a coupon for one topping with a free cheese pizza.  Was told yes.  Placed our order for 2 taco pizzas, in addition one pepperoni with a free cheese pizza to use the coupon.   Received a call from the store manager saying they do not honor the coupons and have been trying to get out of the coupon book for 8 years.  She was not willing to budge even though I have the valid coupon. So, how much did they lose?

 Ended up cancelling our order over a free cheese pizza.  Crazy!!!!!"}
{"text":"So we were told this place was great but we were completely disappointed. We went in and the first thing that we noticed was that it was a mess. Food and stuff all over the ground. The actual place where the pizzas are made was a mess. Food and condiments all over! It was gross. And there was even a small knat flying around the sauce. But we still decided to give it a shot. The cashier was polite and she said it was awesome. Then another girl came up to make our pizza. She was rude and angry. She was slopping food all over the place and was treating the other co worker like crap while also literally throwing things behind the pizza making area. She acted like we were a huge inconvenience and when she got to the end she was just like here. The directions are on there you can call back if you don't get it. I walked into that place excited to try something new and walked out feeling so grumpy because the place was gross and the service was crap!! The girl who made my pizza last night def needs to change her attitude if she is going to be working with people. She treated her co worker terrible and Us. Then I got home and made the pizza and it was gross. Def not fresh ingredients. I will not be going back. And I will tell all my friends not to go back as well. No need for anyone to pay to get treated crappy like that!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is average, but way over priced.  Why buy a pizza here for $10 when I can walk down the sidewalk to dominos and get a large 3 topping for $8?  Cooked!  They need to lower their prices to stay in competition.  Based on their location, and bein able to take EBT because they sell uncooked food, they are able to remain competitive."}
{"text":"The Best Take & Bake Franchise... The food as well as the staff are Excellent!  Will def make this my fav pizza pickup from now on!"}
{"text":"I never had purchased Papa Murphy's pizza before, but tried it based on a friend's recommendation. I ordered two pizzas, which each cost $16 after tax. I followed all the baking directions. The vegetarian pizza didn't bake right and even after 40 minutes, the inside of the crust was doughy. The pepperoni pizza came out fine and tasted ok. Service was slow. I won't buy Papa Murphy's again. $16 is a lot of money for pizza that is no better than one you can get in a box at the grocery store. The staff was friendly and informative."}
{"text":"Tasty pizzas for the prices.  have you tried grilling them instead of cooking them in the oven?  it takes the mediocre pizza experience to a newer level.  Nice people working here, they smiled and treated us very kindly."}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the layout and design of the inside. Much better than older locations."}
{"text":"I went there simply to pick up a pizza and breadsticks. they said it would be 10 minutes it took them 45 minutes. 3 other people we had ordered before got their food before us with similar orders. They said they had breadsticks but some how took 3 people 20 minutes to make. I will give them a second chance but I will probaly end up going to the one farther away."}
{"text":"Meh...it's exactly what you would expect. Nothing spectacular but it's a descent pizza for a good price.

It was pretty busy when we got there but we were able to order right away. The three kids that were working the line were going as fast a they possibly could. We waited about 15-20 min. Next time I will call ahead.

My only complaint is that when there were no customers to ring up, the manager just stood there and told the teens they were moving real fast. It would have been nice if he helped them out and I'm sure they would have appreciated it."}
{"text":"Two words describe this pizza - dang good.  My son had been telling me how great Papa Murphy's Pizza is, and when I tried it, I have to fully agree.  I would say their pizza is on par with Oregano's Pizza, or the now defunct NY54 (was in Chandler).  Really, really great pizza.  I had the thin crust mixed onion and mushroom - delicious!  We also baked a regular crust bacon and pepperoni - also delicious.  You certainly can't go wrong with this pizza, and I will be back soon!  Pizza is take and bake style!"}
{"text":"Late night ladies waiting until 10 min to close to order a pizza? Not a problem here, apparently! They were incredibly gracious about us arriving 3 min before closing and super accommodating about our silly 1/2 and 12 request. Thanks!+"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. Always quick and the place is very clean. Great pizza and great service. They even hold the door for you as you carry your load of freshly made pizzas."}
{"text":"What a weird concept, buy a pizza and then take it home and bake it yourself. The pricing is not bad, but I expected it to be a little cheaper since they are not actually cooking the pizza for you. I love that you can create your own pizza. We got the gluten free crust which is udi's brand. It comes in 1 size that is definitely more than enough for 2 people. The girl told me that the gf crust is already cooked so you just need to heat up the toppings. I cooked it for the recommended 12 minutes anyway and the inside was still gooey. :/ Im not really a fan of the udi's crust which I don't blame Papa Murphy's for but I'd love it if they'd try a different gf brand. I LOVE that they do have a gf option though, even if its not the best crust in the world, atleast I can partake when my friends want to do a Papa Murphy's pizza night."}
{"text":"I must say I'm Pleasantly surprised !!! I'm usually very apprehensive about trying new foods and I wasn't quite sure what to expect with a \"take n' bake\" pizza. Would it have everything I'm used to or would I have to \"fix it up\" once i got home?? Well I didn't have to do a thing. Perfect amount of cheese!!! I LOVEEEE cheesy pizzas!!! The pan (dough) was also very delicious. Not chewy or too hard. Just right!!! My children loved it!! The sauce was also tasty and not piled thickly on the pizza which I hate!!! Seasoned well and very delicious!!! $11 bucks for a large!!! I'm sure we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Heart shaped pizza on Valentine's Day for the win!  They were well staffed and very courteous without being stuffy.  The ingredients are fresh and of good quality.

In my mind pizza is often a cost and expediency driven purchase.  Being that they are neither the cheapest not the easiest (yeah, I don't have to assemble it but I still have to bring it home and cook it) they do a GREAT job of overcoming my objections by filling a niche.  They offer a sit down quality pie at a great price point that I don't have to make a reservation to eat."}
{"text":"This place is like a Subway restaurant for pizza.  The store is very warm, even in winter months.  I felt the toppings were limited and didn't look too fresh. Over all, tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Anallah and Tani are wonderful at this location. Anallah gave me a discount even though I left my coupons at home, and Tani was so nice. I picked up 3 pizzas for a birthday party, and she gave me free large 1 topping pizza vouchers to give to friends and family to try. I could tell that they really care about their customers and every pizza I take home to bake is super fresh. 

Thank you for being so kind; my family and I will be back often."}
{"text":"OMG...this is the best Papa Murphy's in the valley.  The owner of this franchise should be proud.  All his employees are very friendly, pleasant and acknowledged you as a customer.  Kudos to Jacob and Cole who helped us this evening.  We come and pick up each month and all the employees are great!  



The Wagner's in Surprise."}
{"text":"BEST PAPA MURPHY'S IN THE VALLEY!!

You wouldn't think it's entirely difficult to get a pizza made and then you just take it home and bake it. But sometimes with preferences and diet restrictions you might need to get specific....  That's been our need a few times at this location. And EVERY TIME they accommodate. Whether it's half of one thing on the pizza or a quarter of another. Different sauces, cheese, no cheese, whatever it is. They do a great job and great people working there from the top to bottom.

Never a hassle always a great pizza. Support this local Murphs! =)"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza. The whole family loved it!! Great service, not greasy, and fresh ingredients! We will not order from any other pizza place now!"}
{"text":"So my second round was 6 stars if I could give it that. this time I got a chicken bacon stuffed add artichoke... simply amazing!"}
{"text":"EXLENT PIZZA AND ANAZING STAFF! The staff is always so friend and welcoming and helpful! The owner is always there which is a plus. They have never once messed up my order. A good staff team is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I just had the best experience at the Papa Murphy's on Hualapai and Tropicana. I called in my order over the phone and Andrew was so professional and polite, and he also encouraged me to purchase a featured taco pizza. When arriving to the location I was greeted by both Andrew and Bryan. I walked up to 2 friendly smiles ready to serve me. The order was checked for accuracy and was made sure we had all the items we needed for our dinner (including croutons for our salad). When done, Bryan even opened the door for me and carried my pizzas to my car! Thanks guys for showing me such amazing customer service.. I did this review while eating my pizza and I must say it's perfect!!"}
{"text":"Tried this on a whim.  Got a coupon in the mail. Served it at my gathering. Everyone loved it! Will definitely consider buying more!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Service was first class on my phone order. I like the thin crust and garlic chicken."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's pizza. Last time I went in it was around 3pm on there were no customers in the store. Thought Great! Freshest pizza ever... but wait... the employee went to the refrigerator and got a pre-made pizza and then put the toppings on it- so much for fresh made pizza but maybe they were short on people whatever. Took it home and popped it in the oven. Crust did not rise at all and was like cardboard. No problem- call the store to talk to a manager- not there. They took my name and number- never got a call back. OK. Filled out the customer feedback. It asked if I wanted a manager to call me back- yes that would be great! No call back. Guessing it cost me $13 to find out about the customer service at this store. I will now go to the other location."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 stars if they weren't lacking in customer service. Every time I go in there no one greets you when you enter. The cashier has no personality and doesn't like to make sure the order was correct. I guess I'll order from online now. Overall tho the pizza is the bomb! I really love how fresh EVEYTHING is. You can see what they are doing and the restaurant  is so clean. Which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I've had Papa Murphy's in Wisconsin, the one here in Las Vegas is much better."}
{"text":"Papa Murphys is good, fresh pizza--that with a coupon, is a great value. 

Its easy to taste the difference between papa murphys and your more traditional quick pizza places like papa johns, little ceasars, dominos, pizza hut, hungry howies, etc. 

If youre thinking of trying it, dont hesitate. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to pick up the Gourmet chicken garlic pizza n yum yum it was delicious..will go back sure.."}
{"text":"Ordered and paid ($16) for a family-sized pizza (half Cowboy and half Thai Chicken). Went across the parking lot to get some chocolates at Jin Ju (awesome chocolate btw...) and when I got back there was a large pizza waiting for me. Told them that it was a large and not a family-sized (I've been coming to Papa Murphy's since I was a little kid.... back when it was Papa Aldo's.... so I am VERY familiar with their pizzas and sizes). Both employees told me I was mistaken and that it was a family-sized. Didn't want to argue over what amounts to a $4 mistake, so I took the pizza and left. However, I won't be back to this particular location again because of this. I guess I should have taken a picture of the pizza to prove my point, but hindsight is 20/20. lol  I'll go back to the one on Hualapai and Tropicana even though it's a little further drive for me. This it the only time that a Papa Murphy's has ever messed up my order, and I've ordered a lot of pizza from them. Pizza was good though.... Papa Murphy's always makes good pizzas. :)"}
{"text":"The first time I heard about this I was like what???? I gotta bake my own pizza??? Huh??? WTH?? That's stupid! Why would I want to do that??

And then I walked into Papa Murphy's and I ordered my first pizza.... And I realized what a gem this place is. :) Never say never and always always try everything at least once!! :D

This location which is the only location I have been to was very very clean and almost sterile which I really appreciated I'm a food establishment. I was greeted and when I told them it was my first time they explained to be how they work. Very friendly! 

Ambiance 5/5
Service 5/5

So I ordered my pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms with jalapenos on half of it. And I got to actually watch them make it which was awesome! :)

I took my pizza home and baked it off following the instructions.... And it was delish! 

Now I know why so many people enjoy Papa Murphy's! Not only is it cheaper then getting pizza delivered it's tastier cuz it seems fresher. 

Will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I don't know about the best pizza I've ever eaten part. For fast good for your kids type of pizza that you have to bake yourself. I would have to say its pretty decent. They run a clean operation in the two different locations that I have been in."}
{"text":"There's a reason they are getting 5 star reviews: they are earning it.  

We were already familiar with \"take and bake\" from ZPizza in Northern Virginia, so when this Papa Murphy's opened up we were excited to try it. They offer fresh ingredients, quick service, and deals galore.  Be sure to order online on a Wed for 50% off.

I heard the owners will be opening another franchise in Matthews.  Cool.  They are doing a great job so far, as long as they can keep the service aspect up then everyone wins."}
{"text":"The pizza is always great, but I have a couple gripes:  Last time I visited, I brought a coupon to drop the price $3.  They said they applied the coupon to my pizzas...???  the price was the same on the wall (original price)...\"what gives\" I ask...\"our prices have been raised $3\"...such BS.  Also, if you're paying cash, dont bring anything larger than a $20 bill.  Even if the total is $53 and you give them a 50 and 3 ones...they wont accept it.  Some bull about being robbed.  Try using a debit/credit card...that works ok."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Papa Murphy's location since it opened, and have always enjoyed their pizzas, so I figured I should give them some props! The kids love the Papa Faves cheese and pepperoni pizzas, and they are easy on the pocketbook. Love the flavor, and like the fact I can cook them at home. One of the few items I can buy that my kids will eat every time.  The store is always clean and inviting, and staff are fast and friendly. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I went to get a s'more dessert pizza, looks great btw... and I ended getting one. Taco Pizza!  Yes you do have to bake the pizza (take n bake). Yes you can do it ! They freeze well... most. But great staff!"}
{"text":"This Papa Murphys is awesome!!Their employees Vincent and Andrew are fiendly and you can tell that they care about taking care of their customers."}
{"text":"Nothing screams \"authentic\" quite like a pizza place with an Irish name, right? 

Well, inauthentic though it may be, PMs is a nice concept and I enjoy the pizzas now and then. The idea of \"take and bake\" is a fun one and does allow for the cost to stay low while the quality high.  I enjoy that everything is prepared in front of you. My criticism about PMs pizzas are that they tend to be really greasy and sometimes the crusts aren't as even in thickness as they could be - leading to weird cooking times (hence 3 stars and not 4). I'm not sure what sort of cheese combo causes the particular greasiness, but it's nothing a little paper napkin doesn't solve. If you like a thin-ish crust and lots of options with a bit of a change from the standard chain pizza fare, Papa Murphys is the place to try. Yum."}
{"text":"Pizzas taste great. Sides are a good deal. But it always takes longer than you expect, and ordering online doesn't usually work out for me. I'm happy to have it in the neighborhood, but Earth Fare's $5 pizza Fridays usually win..."}
{"text":"Tastes like frozen which is so sad. Better off going across the way to the other pizza joint. Bad location for this franchisee. Wife likes the artichoke pizza which earns the 2nd star.. I will try to convince her to forget this place though. Also not the greatest idea for the guy to talk about the new girl when there is a customer who can hear."}
{"text":"If I'm ordering take out it normally means I'm too lazy to cook or clean at that. So when it comes to a take and bake pizza that's not the first thing I think about. But recently a relative got pizza from Papa Murphy's and i was addicted to their Mediterranean chicken thin crust pizza. 

So I went back and ordered just that a large size $14 uncooked and a deal for the BBQ pizza $11 for a large upsize to family size for an extra $2 not bad and a Papas favorite. That one had to much topping to where we had to throw it back into the oven twice to get it fully cooked. I mean I like extra topping I just didn't want to cook it. 

Any how on the plus size it was good and hot on the bad size you still pay premium price and you have to take it home and cook it. Me I rather order Pizza Hut and get it got delivered and ready to eat for the same price or maybe less. 

This place had nice staff and the shop was clean I will go back when they have specials because those are good for the belly and the wallet!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!
This location just opened near my home, and we are so glad! 

We've been in a few times, once on a very busy football day and then on a slower weeknight. 

Both times we received fast, accurate service and the wait was never long.
I like that we get to watch our pizza being made right in front of us.  The directions to bake are easy to understand and follow.  

The pizza is delicious.  We've had pretty much everything they have on the menu over the years.  The cinnamon dessert wheel is great too.  

The prices are more than the hot and ready pizza across the way, but it is in line for the quality and variety of pizza you get.  
We are Papa Murphys fans, and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"What a find!  I've looked for a good 'take and bake' pizza place and finally found Papa Murphs's. Everything is fresh. The thin crust is great. Service is excellent and the staff is nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to go and get another one."}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza joint. love the convenience of the drive through. my pizzas are always perfect, and the staff is always helpful and very nice. I'm actually on my way to go grab another pie :) thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try Papa Murphy's. I kept seeing the commercials about the \"take-n-bake\" aspect of the business and I was curious. I ordered online because I don't like to wait. Upon my arrival my order was ready and the girl who greeted me was very nice. Making sure I noticed the direction enclosed with both items so that I will bake them properly. 

Everything looked fresh. I baked the pizza at 425 for 15 minutes. It came out perfectly. I think another minute or two would've been too long. It tasted great as well. BTW, they have pizza cutters there for purchase just in case you don't want to use a knife. Of course it's easier to cut with a cutter.

I also ordered the cinnamon wheel. I baked it for 10 minutes and again, perfection. I put the icing in the microwave for too long. I looked away for a second, so don't do that!

I would recommend a Papa Murphy's pizza and I look forward to trying additional toppings next time."}
{"text":"We went to this location and had dealt with an assistant manager the other night. After  we got home to prep the pizza we ordered, we noticed that the crust was thinner than a normal size crust.  We did file a complaint at their website, but wanted to give them another go as suggested from customer service.  Day 2, spoke with the manager Samantha? and she resolved my issue with my order.  The food we got was great and now I am convinced that this location has earned return visits from us. Great job Papa Murphy's. 

**** Gave four stars, because of the misunderstanding that occured the other night."}
{"text":"Outstanding value, taste, freshness, and service. Ordered Chicken Bacon Artichoke deLITE and Herb Chicken Mediterranean deLITE - DELICIOUS. 
* The Rea Road phone number on YELP is WRONG (704) 752-5955 , it is actually 704-752-5995."}
{"text":"The pizza here is always great! It's very convenient to bake. The cook time is short and it always comes out cheesy and delicious! The staff here is super friendly, especially the shift leaders Kennedee and Gabby! They always greet me with a warm welcome when I come in and make me feel great about my experiences at Papa Murphy's. It's the reason I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My last experience at this location was 3 stars. It's been over a year and a half since my last visit. It looks like they have a new staff. My visit last night, Friday, January 13, 2017 AD, was much better. It looks like they solved their, \"crust not stretched to the edge of the baking platter problem\".

The pizza I purchased and cooked was fantastic! I'm only giving them 4 stars at this time. In a few months, if they maintain their quality, I will probably bump it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"While I sat waiting for my Cowboy to be ready....pizza that is- I noticed a young gentlemen I think should be mentioned, unfortunately I didn't catch his name. As he made pizzas he took time to respond and greet  customers, I watched as he spoke  to a small child and made him smile! Young or old that kind of service isn't seen often enough,service with a smile goes a long way! He made at least two customers smile, and this customer will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"This location has a friendly staff that is very efficient! The pizzas are tasty and the preparation area clean. You can't beat the price."}
{"text":"The employees are super friendly and the prices are affordable for a high quality pizza!"}
{"text":"We picked up a double stuff pizza from Papa Murphys take and bake.  Not as much cheese as I would like on the second layer but the pizza was really good.  I also had them add cheese into the crust and it was really good.  I would say if you have the time you should do the take and bake.  They don't offer cooked pizzas but it was fun to pick up a fresh pizza and cook it."}
{"text":"Take and Bake pizza makes sense! It tastes great, is supremely fresh and is a ton cheaper! Papa Murphy's offers custom toppings, vegetarian options and good old fashioned combinations! The staff at this location is fresh, fun & friendly. Whether you call your order in or come to order in person - the wait time is usually under 10 minutes. Ask for a punch card - after so many orders you get a free pizza. 5 stars for solid service and selection! Let Papa Murphy's do the cooking for you tonight!"}
{"text":"Lovely thin crust! When I carry out pizza, I usually want it ready for the table. So, I was dubious about buying Pizza from a Take N Bake. However, I am a sucker for using a coupon. I was pleasantly surprised that they assembled the pizza onsite. The ingredients looked fresh behind the counter, the customer service was friendly, and the smell of the rising dough was appetizing. It took less than 20 minutes to bake our pizza in the oven. We loved our single toppings pizzas best. We ordered one sausage and one pepperoni. The pizzas were a good size and were tasty. We will come back again to try some of the specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Cheese that tastes like chewing gum, pizza had to be heated twice, expensive compared to other take and bake pizzas! Suggest you get your take and bake pizza from Fry's, Safeway or best of all, Costco."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  I went in with a completed loyalty card, but the girl at the register counted the stamps and I was one short  (Hard to read, some are upside down, some look like stamps over stamps, etc.  - how the heck should I know to count them!)  She said the card can look deceiving because numbers 11 and 12 were definitely stamped.  Unfortunately, I only had a little clutch purse with me with a few dollars and my cell - turned out I was $2 short of cash.  On the verge of returning to my car to scrounge for loose change, I noticed I had a $4 off coupon, which solved the problem.  After paying, I still had to wait for my pizza even though I had phoned in the order AND I WAS THE ONLY CUSTOMER IN THE SHOP!!  I bet this girl thinks she is an under paid fast food worker, but considering her service to me she is overpaid.  They publish coupons all the time and she could easily have given me $2 off or asked the manager about the deceiving (her words) loyalty stamps.  I didn't ask for the manager because it was probably her."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I used to get whatever pizza was on special with a gluten free crust and they would simply upcharge for the crust. Today the girl working the register tells me she would have to charge me for a create your own pizza and add each topping individually with a gluten free crust. I explained I've bought the special before and only paid difference for crust but she insisted I had to do create your own. I won't be going back. I'm not going to pay $20 for a gluten free pizza I have to bake myself. I'll stick with Barro's where I can get a baked gluten free pizza loaded with toppings for under $14 without any hassle."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great service all smiles when you walk in call you by name, they take your pizza out and open the door not to mention great pizza. Super super fast service.  In a Time when service is lacking this is so uncommonly good.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Their Large Chicken Bacon Artichoke Thin Crust pizza was really tasty. I would've given them 3 other stars, but the issue below really concerned me...

The issue I had was with regards to the transaction I made to purchase this pizza. On 11/01 - Tuesday - pick up was ready at 7PM, I made a purchase online via this website here: https://www.papamurphys.com/menu#menuBannerPopup (you can find your store location as well - I used 89131). As with any online transactions you receive an order confirmation of your purchase via the e-mail you put in. I entered my debit card information and got an e-mail of a $10.00 bill. 

Anyways, my husband and I drive down to the store at 7PM and a gentleman behind the counter tells me, \"Sorry Ms. it looks like your card declined, I'll need to charge you again.\" So, without hesitation, I say, 'Sure, that's fine.' I looked at the register and the bill he was trying to charge me came out to $17.50. I was shocked...this was my first time ordering Papa Murphy's online...so I tell him, 'Sir, I think that's a mistake...I paid $10.00 online.' He says, \"Really? For the whole thing?\" I said, 'Yes, for the whole Large Chicken Bacon Artichoke Thin Crust pizza'. 

I then pull out my phone and show him the e-mail confirmation of $10.00 - confirmation # 4200 (snapshot below). He looks at it and says, \"Eh okay, I'll charge you $10.00 - I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW THIS WHOLE ONLINE STUFF WORKS.\" I'm thinking to myself, hmm okay. I understand. Despite this, I asked him nicely if he accepts tips. He gladly says, \"ABSOLUTELY WE DO\". 

Its the 3rd - Thursday - about 2 days since this whole event. I decide to check my bank, low and behold - 2 TRANSACTIONS for $10.00. I went through the steps to dispute the charge with my bank - no success. I then decide to call their location instead - Phone: (702) 413-7171. A nice representative named Spring told me the owner will take care of it. I'm hopeful he will. Just a little scarred about experiencing this (perhaps again) with Papa Murphy's as a new customer. 

Advice to Management/Owner - please have Spring be the supervisor of the kid that duped me and told me my card declined - there are two transactions on my account for $10.00. I'm just hoping that male representative isn't doing this to cheat people into giving him tips. Its atrociously playing the system. :/ 

Advice to others - please PLEASE, make sure to bring in a printed copy of the order confirmation you receive after ordering from this website: https://www.papamurphys.com/menu#menuBannerPopup and their location - Farm Rd 
8426 Farm Rd 
Las Vegas , NV, 89131. If you don't, you might end up like me, 2 transactions and an experience with a male representative who might just want to cheat you. 

They have delicious pizza, just a bummer that this happened."}
{"text":"Long time lover of papa's pizzas.  This is a new location and staff is still working out some issues. Overall I am very happy with quality of food."}
{"text":"Very short-staffed tonight and running out of ingredients, but are handling themselves so well that they (Patrick and Dominique) both deserve raises!"}
{"text":"Turns out, I actually like this place. The only thing that sucks about this particular location is that they are slowwww. For a take and bake spot we waited almost as long as it would have been to cook the pie, which kinda defeats the purpose. On Tuesdays any large pizza is $10 and a family size is $12. You can get a specialty pizza or create your own up to 5 toppings. Even the premium toppings are included in the total price so it's a good deal. I've recently fallen in love with their white creamy garlic sauce, it makes a great base for a yummy pizza. If you are on the fence, you can get half white sauce and half red sauce on your pie and see what one you like best. 

Besides pizza they have breadsticks, cheesesticks, salads, and even cookie dough. They just added a new dessert, a cinnamon wheel that comes with a delicious cream cheese frosting. It's like eating pieces of a cinnamon roll. So good! I'm glad I gave this place another try. Check your mailbox because they send coupons frequently in the money mailer envelopes."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Papa Murphy's and often order online to pick up in the store on my way home from work.  The last two times I've ordered extra toppings on the pizzas they haven't been made right and I have to ask about the extra topping at pickup.  No problem - they put the extra topping in a little cup and you put it on at home.  My thing is .. I'm paying $1.50 for extra toppings.  I hate getting the little cups because depending on the extra topping, you aren't getting your moneys worth based on what fits in that tiny cup compared to if they just added the extra topping to the pizza.  My last pizza I ordered artichokes and paid the $1.50.  When I got home, I took the little container out and there were a whopping one full leaf in the cup and a bunch of singles.  After separating the full leaf, the \"extra\" topping didn't cover up half the pizza.

I think I'll stick to the location (89117) closer to home."}
{"text":"Good: I walked in and was greeted by the entire assembly line.

Bad: Everything else. Once they did their company policy greeting, they were real punks. I'll give the young guy an exception. He kept quiet and had to deal with his coworkers longer than I had to. When we ordered, we had a coupon, then asked if we could stack another coupon. They replied with \"No. Because you're already getting like $4 off anyways.\" Ok? Be more more of a smart butt next time, please. Then we ordered the pizza. We ordered a 5-meat stuffed pizza and I requested that they don't put cheddar on it, and instead use mozzarella. They were annoyed, then they took a pre made pizza, and literally scraped off the toppings with their hands right in front of us. ....yummy.


Some additional comments:

* You're a pizza place. Pizza is Italian. It's literally an Italian sin to put cheddar cheese on a pizza. Stop with the cheddar cheese, non Italian \"pizza\" makers. 

*And yes, I know how to turn the oven on. Thanks for asking and insulting my intelligence."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. Bring a coupon or ask for some for next time they are happy to take them."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because it seems that almost every time we order a delivered pizza, there is some kind of issue with it, and mostly disappointment.   I am glad we tried them!!  They make the pizza right in front of you the way you want it.  You take it home and cook it up.  The crust and sauce are good, and always enough cheese   We get a pizza on their regular crust with spicy fennel sausage, beef and bacon with Extra cheese. ..  Its SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!! Hot fresh and Deeeeelicious! Also no pans to wash!!! They put every pizza on a disposable pizza pan!!!  We have not gotten a delivered pizza since we have gone there. We have had Papa Murphys at least once a week since we decided to try them though  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The man in charge of the place was just so friendly and kind! 

Surprised this place isn't busier!"}
{"text":"love papa murphies.  like the fact that i can cook my pizza at home and that it is fresher and hotter then in a pizza joint or delivery.  the staff the is very friendly and ready to help you right away.  you do not have a long wait while your pizza is cooking.  they put it together for you and you take it home and put it in the oven or even on the bbq grill.  i love this place so much they they already know my name and greets me everytime i come in.  keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great service with a smile and a superb Spicy Fennel sausage thin crust pizza. We drive from Mooresville just to see y'all !!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! Always get greeted with a smile.   Fresh ingredients, great flavor."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza that doesn't taste greasy.  It reminds me of the pizza I ate growing up from Stater Bros.  (Store from California).  There are plenty of options from meaty, fancy, creative, to vegetarian.  

The only downfall is that you need an oven to bake it at home, otherwise they taste great and the cheesy bread is awesome.  They always send fliers in the mail or have a deal on Tuesdays.  

Great price, great pizza, and conveniently located next to Fry's Market."}
{"text":"At first I was disappointed because I hadn't realized it was take and bake and was anxious to eat a piece of pizza on my way home. After getting home and baking it, I was soooo NOT disappointed any longer.  It was the best pizza I have eaten anywhere PERIOD.  We had the Gourmet Veggie and it was simply delicious.  Can't wait to get another."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they have the BEST customer service!! They are very friendly and make conversation the whole time you are in the store. They always let me know about deals that are available. The food always taste amazing, and my daughters love the Mini Murphy kids pizza they make themselves. The best part, when you are walking out they hold the door open for you!"}
{"text":"The staff is always very friendly and cheerful. We've never had to wait for long and if there's a line, they remember to acknowledge you.  So happy this opened up in Laveen!!"}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's and love the new location even better. The owners are so of the nicest people and run a great store. The only issue I have about the place is the extremely unprofessional shift manager I'm assuming. She scolded the girl taking the orders so spelling words out right in front of multiple customers when she could have easily finished her work and taken her employee in back to coach her in private.

This won't keep me from coming back but I was sure embarrassed for her regarding her management skills during a slight rush.

I couldn't give less than 4 stars for one bad apple."}
{"text":"I've had great take and bake and this is an okay one.  The toppings are indeed fresh however the crust was no better than frozen or a similarly priced chain baked pizza.   Great value but an okay pizza"}
{"text":"Their site was down so I couldn't print the coupon and she said they just got a phone call about that then said they didn't take the bonus card and would give me a dollar for every stamp, so you think $6 dollars off no way 3 dollars off and now they charge if you have anything besides the red sauce and pizza was a far cry from good!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza.  Shady business practices.
Papa Murphy's always has coupons.  They do not indicate an expiration date.  Ordered a pizza the other day and they said they will not honor the coupon as stated as it was printed last year.  Again - no expiration date.  No date showing when it was printed.   When I challenged this, the person was quite rude.  I guess their practice is to get you in the door with the coupon - just to tell you the price really is higher.  Bait & switch.  Shady & unethical."}
{"text":"We saw the highly entertaining 'sign spinner' for this place out on Riggs road and decided to stop in after a day on the golf course. 

Yes, we were surprised to receive an uncooked pizza with instructions how to bake it at home, after all, the idea was to not have to cook, right? 

Well, this turns out to be even better and has become a favorite after-golf dinner option!

We can get to the house and get settled in, put our clubs away, feed the dogs, take care of things, then when it's time to shower off the golf, the pizza goes in the oven! 

About the time we're all cleaned up, the house smells delicious and that pizza is golden brown!

Service is always fast, even if there's a rush before a big game, and the ingredients are always fresh, never frozen. 

We like the thin crust gourmet veggie to keep it light, but all the specialty pizzas are delish and a bit out of the ordinary. They'll do half-n-half, so no more negotiating with the meat-lover or picky children! 

There may be better pizzas at sit-down Italian restaurants to enjoy over a nice glass of red, but when you need a delicious option when you don't have the time or the energy to cook, this pizza is a great choice! 

Oh yeah, there's some pretty nice salads ready in the cooler, cheesy bread and cookie pizza/dough all ready to take home and bake while you're devouring the pizza! Yum! 

(I'm going for a late-night raid on the refrigerator for that last extra slice I know is in there!)"}
{"text":"Everyone I talk with who has had this pizza loves it. I think it is fine, but love it, nope.

No matter how I cook these things it turns out much more soggy than I would like. The ingrediants are fine but they sure do give off a lot of moisture when baking it.

So it is not horrible, just not really to my liking."}
{"text":"I knew of this place prior to moving to Vegas as they had them in Oregon where I grew up. Always been a huge fan as the pizza is as fresh as you could probably get without making it yourself. and you don't have to worry about the dreaded possibility of it showing up cold via delivery as you bake it at home.

It's definitely worth it to call in ahead and have them make it for you since by the time you get there it will be ready and you're in and out. They also have a ton of great sides and other items to compliment the pizza's like the cinnamon wheels, cheesy bread sticks, smores pizzas, salads, cookie dough etc. I was excited when they built this location as it's closer to my home area (Nellis AFB) and the one I had to drive to prior was the one on craig/decatur. Hands down love me some Papa Murphy's, their stuffed pizzas are our favorite!"}
{"text":"Good service...friendly staff and great pizza!!
I've been here twice and both times good food!
Pizza is a bit pricey for having to take it home and cook it yourself..BUT!.....not your run of the mill pizza chains! \"I'll be bock\"!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain pizza joint.  The chicken bacon pizza is the best.  Go there on Thursday's, because that's when they run the specials.  I think it's better than frozen grocery store pizza... so, there!"}
{"text":"Been a customer for years and highly recommended. The pizza is always made fresh in front of you and you bake it yourself. Many choices to decide from standard pizza and Chicago style. All amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in Vegas came from Papa Murphys, I've been buying their pizzas since 2002 when I first stumbled across it and couldn't pass up the 6.99 family size pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately all great things come to an end and that awesome deal is gone but luckily the amazing taste is still just as good as ever. Just had this pizza and it still tastes just like the first time I had it, incredible. Overall amazing pizza, I would choose them over any other pizza."}
{"text":"Love !! So glad they built this location, love their pizza and have been going to them for years (another location ). The ingredients are always fresh!"}
{"text":"Gluten Free pizza is not excellent. It's actually pretty bad and gave me an upset stomach. The crust was actually gummy. Customer service in Fountain Hills is indeed excellent. Their other pizzas are good if you cook it right. For the regular pizzas I like to put olive oil on the crust before I cook it. I slide the pizza off the paper pan and pour olive oil onto the pan then replace the pizza. Slide the pizza off the pan for the last 5 mins directly onto the oven rack to make it slightly crunchy."}
{"text":"This is nothing towards the location or anything that why it's a 5 star but I'm a little heart broken that they only carry the Mexican pizza in may :( you should carry it all year long it's amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have always loved this Papa Murphy's location... But We rarely eat here now. My wife and daughter have celiac disease and when Papa Murphy's got their new GF crust we were all very excited. The old management worked with us on coupons because they knew we were very consistent customers. Pizza was the thing my family craved the most after the celiac diagnosis limited our diet. When Papa Murphy's started the gluten-free crust it really mattered to our family. I still like their customer service. And when we are able to purchase pizza they are very careful with our order. But because of the cost we are now only able to order a few times a year rather than the 1 to 2 times a week we used to. Really wish Papa Murphy's would include their gluten-free in there special offers. Their pizza is delicious but now we are forced to consider other options. Management is nice and friendly and can run their business how they wish but that limits our purchases. The rating is only for the cost of pizza"}
{"text":"So happy there's finally one of these in the north central area of Phoenix. They're a great pizza option if you want to pick something up and eat it later. If you want a hot pizza to eat right away there are better options in the area, but if you're trying to plan a meal ahead of time this is such a great place. I would recommend ordering one of their delite pizzas. The crust cooks perfectly and the delite topping choices are amazing. I absolutely love their chiicken bacon artichoke delite. It is one of my favorites! I feel like their regular crust pizzas cook up a little too doughy ( at least in my oven) so I prefer the delite crust since it bakes up more crispy."}
{"text":"Nice folks but Mediterranean salad was deceiving.  Looked like it was chock full of goodness, but proved to be just on top and rest of container was pure lettuce.  Wife had to add her own ingredients to complete it.  Cave Creek & Tatum makes a much better salad."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Not your ordinary pizza place. Everything is made with fresh ingredients and you can really taste the difference. Staff were kind and knowledgeable. Look forward to coming here often!"}
{"text":"OMG.  Just finished our first Papa Murphys Pizza.  It was fantastic. The staff was great and friendly.

We will be back for more."}
{"text":"We have been very satisfied with this PM location.  The staff is always friendly and professional, always has our pizza ready in 5 to 7 minutes, and the pizzas are outstanding! I recommend the thin crust."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's gluten free crust is the best I've tasted since I went gluten free four years ago (due to Celiac Disease).  They also have an excellent nutritional guide for people with other nutritional considerations.  They use very tasty, fresh toppings, which makes them the best take home pizza on my shopping list."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to store bought pizza. It tastes fresh ad takes half the amount of time to cook. Compare it to a local joint or dominos and I say this isn't as good.. Just my opinion

Call ahead and order it for a quicker experience. Sign up for their deals. I love their valentines and Halloween pizza, which are shaped like hearts or pumpkins. Pretty neat. 

I like that if you go in person to order you can watch them make your pizza with the fresh ingredients. Nothing to hide

Customer service was okay, they looked like they hated their job. Poor fellows. 

The last few times I was here they were super busy because they accept EBT. Nothing wrong with people on it but it made it super packed near the beginning of the month"}
{"text":"Korrine the Shift manager needs to learn a little bit about customer service. Regardless of what she heard me say verses what I said is null. She messed up my order which I was willing to pay the difference. I was not willing to wait another 10-15 min for HER to fix error by making me wait behind all the other orders that came in since mine. She should have taken the the 2 min it would have taken to quickly fix the mistake. She should have NOT told me that I ordered wrong by saying \"large Pan\" instead of simply \"pan\". I have been here several times and have never had an issue with the way I have ordered my pizza. Completely, 100% unprofessional. Will never return to this establishment. The franchise owner should rethink who represents them on the front line. I have called the corporate office and made a complaint. Korrine I hope as you get a little older you will learn how to treat your customers."}
{"text":"Had pizza from here again last night and it was delish! Forget ever getting a frozen pizza again for convenience this is the way to go! We love the thin crust the best, allows for you to eat more without getting to full!"}
{"text":"Steven Valeria and Angela where very helpful and fun to deal with. Very cool concept to buy then bake at home."}
{"text":"The guy who redid my pizza has a great attitude and I really appreciate what he did good pizza and good customer service skills once again thank you for being positive about the situation."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place!  We love the gluten free crust!  They are always fast and friendly!  Always our first choice for pizza!"}
{"text":"We always stop here to get a pizza before heading home! I had a text saying the classic Italian was being offered, not sure what was on that, but decided to give it a try! Oh my, it was so good!!!! It was better than going to a eat-in pizza restaurant! So many topping, and cheese, I love white sauce so it was right up there! Hubby loved it too! It's not on the menu so hopefully it will be, or they send me another text because I will definitely get this one again!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had originally heard of Papa M's when I was in college. I thought the concept was ridiculous. Why not just buy a frozen pizza from the grocery store or go to Pizza Hut?

I finally decided to give it a try when a new location was built near my house. Armed with a coupon, I indulged on some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. The ingredients are fresh, and the crust is probably the best ever. 

I'm here a couple of times of month. You can build your own pizza or choose from one of the menu items. I've had just about ever type of pizza. My favorite is the Chicken Bacon Artichoke on thin crust with red sauce. Perfection! The owners are extremely nice and helpful. Definitely my go-to spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"I only order from the Weddington and Indian Trail location because it's the same owners. The employees remember my daughter and I by name and order. Quality service and staff. We also saw them at an event where my Girl Scouts were helping the public, and they brought us over two Large free pizzas. I love this place! They deserve the acknowledgement!"}
{"text":"Tried quite a few of their pizzas (thanks to an event at the Siskey YMCA) and was totally blown away. Coming from Florida, I remembered passing a couple Papa Murphy's, but never ordered from them since they are take and bake. However, after trying the Herb Chicken pizza, I became extremely more open to the idea. The idea of fresh and not frozen, is the big seller for me too. Great job Papa Murphy's on creating some delicious pizzas!"}
{"text":"This place really deserves 5-Stars. The staff is super nice and friendly, and the place is literally immaculate. The gluten free dough was great, which surprised me because I was assuming a compromised texture. I about had a heart attack when I found out that I had to bake the pizza myself. Luckily, it was actually really easy to make, and I don't remember having a single dish to do. Would come back, five stars."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and it was the closest pizza place so I called and ordered pizza and went in to pick it up... No one told me when I ordered that the pizza is sold as is and needs to be baked at home..."}
{"text":"Love the idea of fresh take n bake pizza! It's homemade, without all of the mess in the kitchen! The pizza is delicious, the crust is excellent, and the staff are super friendly. Plus their cookie dough makes an excellent snack while you wait for the pizza to bake. (I'm only mostly kidding) kudos Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"Tried this for the 1st time.  Had the hardest time convincing myself to try since it was one of those where you have to call cook it yourself.  I ordered the Chicago style stuffed pizza and it was actually very good!  My wife and 3 year old daughter enjoyed it too!  They are not big pizza fans but really liked it.  Was also cool that it was only $10 when I picked it up when I was coming home from work.  Giving 4 stars for the food.  I was turned off by one of the staff members when I stopped inside the store.  I believe her name is Talice.  She wasn't wearing her name tag so I had to ask another girl that was working for her name.  She didn't seem happy to be there and was not very pleasant either.  She seemed irritated and did not have any customer service skills.  I asked what the popular item was as it was my first experience and she seemed irritated from my question.  Not really someone I want to deal with again.  Must have been an off day as previous reviews says that the staff is awesome.  The girl that prepared my pizza was ok.  Her name was CJ.  I'd still come back as the food was good but as long as I don't have to deal with that cranky employee again.  She was definitely a HUGE turn off!"}
{"text":"I have loved Papa Murphy's for years. I was so excited that they built one close. The garlic chicken pizza is to die for. If i could give 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"The manager, Kenedee,  at Papa Murphys is very rude. She totally ignored my husband when he went in to order our pizza. When I went back in with him the young man, Caleb, working there immediately acknowledged us and gave us great service. My husband talked to the manager about her rudeness and she denied doing it and rolled her eyes. Very unprofessional. I can't believe she is a manager or even employed serving customers. Beware."}
{"text":"Nasty.  I got papas favorite and it tasted really weird when I got home.  Tasted like some ingredients weren't fresh. I realized it was the red sauce, it tasted so bad I couldn't finish my slice.  I went back to let them know how gross it was.  They brought out a huge book of complaints for me to write my complait in.  A HUGE BOOK!  Anyways, they allowed me to order another pizza.  This time I ordered my pizza with the white sauce.  It was better but it wasnt great either.  Little Ceasars or Digorno is 100 times better.  (BTW, you have to cook the pizza at home)  I will save my self trouble and just get digorno.  or go get a pizza thats already prepared for me."}
{"text":"First time going here, cool take and bake pizza! Got it home half the pizza was sticking to the pan after baking. And the crust was soggy and mushy"}
{"text":"Normally I love papa murphys.  I am giving them a one star because of a ridiculous rule....  I ordered a 5 pizza and asked to add cheese,  the manager explained to me that they can not alter the pizza. This is so humorous to me because you would not allow a customer to pay for extra cheese...... SO  you won't allow a customer to spend additional money at your company ??"}
{"text":"Hate to be harsh but continuously get bad service. They forgot my artichokes that I payed extra for and never gave me a full refund not to mention it takes 12 stamps for a free pizza that only allows you to receive a family size with one topping total rip off the pizza is delicious but the employees are terrible worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"This place has some internal issues. While I had no issues with Pizza. The Employees were off the wall ridiculous! The average wait time for them to make your Pizza is about 3-5 minutes, depending on who is all in line. While my girlfriend and I were in there by our selves waiting for our Pizza to be made on Sunday May 29th The Cashier was a 6 foot plus black man. After he rang us up, he what looked to continue to have an arrangement with another man who was making my Pizza. The cashier, in front of us customers, said and i quote \" Papa Murphy doesn't mean shit to me, They need me more then i need them. Ill be more then happy to come over there and drop your ass N***a.\" The man kept repeating him self over and over that \"im done wich you\" . Before we left the cashier and employee left the front and went into the back. The 2 other employees  finished up our Pie and we left. The man who handed me my pizza said \"Im sorry about that' as we left. As large share holder into the tanking NASDAQ: FRSH papa Murphy stock. I was so discussed that i complained trading everything away at a loss. You will not see me back into this store any time soon which sucks cause there isnt a closer Papa."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good but the company (not the local franchise) seems to be cutting back on options. My favorite pizza sauce is no longer available.

Also the do not take American Express."}
{"text":"I love it. The gourmet vegetarian pizza is paradise. The service is what you expect -- yeah, its just kids working but its Papa Murphy's -- a food chain -- not a private restaurant. If you order there, its cool to check out the nearby movie rental place to pass the time or call ahead."}
{"text":"They have been open now for a bit and they are improving a ton love the pizza and love that if you ask they help you with a deal.  The Thai chicken is amazing. Love the new cheesy bread.  I recommend trying both.  The staff is as always good and trying. Several months ago they were just learning and had just opened. But now they rock for sure. I usually order my pizza and then walk to walmart  and grab ice cream and soda, come back and everything is amazing and quick."}
{"text":"Great pizza, excellent quality, good prices and always, always super friendly service; by everyone. Owner is all about supporting the community, such a great quality!!"}
{"text":"This store is the BEST Papa Murphy's in Vegas/ Henderson. The management goes above and beyond for customer service. 
I highly recommend visiting this store."}
{"text":"Papa Murphys is always the best. Management at this location is GREAT! BEST pizza and BEST crew!"}
{"text":"They do a great job. The people working currently as of Feb. 14th 2017 are awesome. Witnessed some picky women being condescending to a worker because she wanted \" special ingredients \" on the heart shaped pizza. The kid held his composure as she was gonna \"watch him put the white sauce in making sure it was on the pizza\" he did great and acted kind. This was around 6:30. Give him a raise it was packed tonight!"}
{"text":"First time ever to try this place and was very pleasantly surprised with the options. There is a menu of different specialty pizzas you can choose from or you can create your own. Their Large is about $14 and I ordered the Thin crust \"Cowboy\" which is their popular pizza to go (pepperoni, sausage, black olives, shredded cheese & herbs). They also have ready made salads which was a no-brainer for the convenience and price (2 for $8) and portions were generous. The large will feed 2-3 depending on the appetite. Pizza was so tasty when you reheat at home. They wrap your pizza to go and instructions are listed on the pizza so its very easy. I will be back again. I think what I liked most was that you can have a gourmet pizza without the hassle of having to go to a restaurant, yet not quite like reheating a pizza from a box if that makes sense. Staff was friendly, and Yelp gives you a $3 off a pizza so don't forget that!"}
{"text":"The first three times I had this pizza I just adored it.

The last time it was just so-so.  Not sure why as I was really looking forward to it.  Didn't even finish eating all of the two pizzas we bought and just threw the leftovers away.

Nice that there are coupons for B1G1 in the entertainment books.  Enjoy the veggie pizza the most."}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Papa Murphy's on many occasions and love it. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always great. The ingredients are fresh, they make it and you take it home and bake it. I always call ahead and they will have it waiting for you to pick it up."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and pick up a pizza because we received a coupon in the weekly mailer. It was nice to be able to customize it and select the fresh toppings you want. The thin crust was a pleasant surprise and was very good. When I checked in on yelp there we even saved an additional 20%. Once we got home, we preheated the over to 425 and 15 minutes later we were enjoying our pizza.

Enjoy the pics and try one for yourselves!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Papa Murphy's to have a fresh made pizza made and was pleasantly surprised that with the Yelp check in you get 20% off your order, what a nice surprise!

Can't wait to get home and bake it!"}
{"text":"You're kidding. This place has been open for months and months and I'm the first to review? Ok. I've had Papa Murphy's back when I was living in Washington state, and I thought it was an excellent idea at the time. Take-and-bake pizza hasn't really hit Arizona, but there needs to be more of these stores. It's sort of like the pizza version of Subway. You order the size, crust type and type of pizza that you're after and then your pizza is constructed before your eyes. The dough is flattened out, white or red sauce applied, cheese and toppings next (you can ask for more or less of each), and then finally the pizza is placed on a special tray which can be put directly into the oven. They wrap it with industrial-size Saran and you're good to go. Total construction time is typically ten minutes, but there's often a queue at the Surprise location.

They have a new pizza flavour which is my absolute favourite at the moment - the Chicken/Bacon/Artichoke pizza. I just polished off the last slice of it for lunch today. It tastes a little better when it's fresh, but reheated it was still great. They have a decent variety of pizzas and crust types, ranging from the \"dee-lite\" crust which is about 1/32 of an inch thick, right through to their thick and stuffed crust. Regular pizzas typically take 12-18 mins at 425 deg. Longer for their stuffed crust ones. You can cook immediately when you get home or throw in the freezer for later.

The prices are great as well. I bought a family size thick crust CBA pizza for $14.99 - enough for three people with a couple of slices left over. I can usually pack it away, but three slices took me down to Chinatown last night. They have huge pizzas here - the stuffed crust supreme ones could probably satisfy the biggest of appetites with just 2-3 slices. Way cheaper than delivery and fresher. They also have a couple of other sundry items such as containers of salad and even cookie dough! You can call ahead too - when you walk in you're welcomed and asked whether you're there to pick up or place an order.

If I had to pick something that ain't great about the place, it would have to be the lack of seats for waiting. There's just a single lame Ikea-style particle-board bench with a few magazine on it. When there's a lot of people you've got no choice but to lean against the wall since the bench probably holds 2.5 people. And you could be waiting up to 30 mins or more in peak times. They should throw about ten cheap chairs against the wall. Anyway, doesn't detract from the quality of the product.

Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I have tried Papa Murphy's about 8 years ago or so, I couldn't even remember if I liked it or not.  We received a coupon in the mail for a free large pizza so after a long day of running errands & shopping we decided to just grab a pizza for dinner.  The young guy behind the counter was friendly but they were out of breadsticks, how do you run out of breadsticks?! The salads didn't look too fresh so we just decided to stick to the pizza without any sides.  It took about 5 min from when we walked in to when we walked out with our pizza, not bad.  As for the actual flavor, I thought it was just okay.  I noticed their prices, about $11-14 for a pizza that you still have to cook.  Call me silly but if I'm paying normal pizza prices, I'm wanting a pizza that is already cooked...especially since that means I have to heat up my kitchen in this PHX heat!"}
{"text":"Loved the Chicken Mediterranean white pizza, but I saw today now this location is closed. :("}
{"text":"Chicken artichoke is my go to! I love take and bake because it doesn't make me feel all gross and oily after eating pizza!"}
{"text":"Well, I never thought I'd be reviewing Papa Murphy's but after seeing their crap rating, I feel compelled to.....we order from here a few times a year at least when we're having my friend and her kid over, who just happen to always love pizza. ;) I really like their thin crust choices, and people are talking about the 'price' for having to bring it home and bake it - I think it's reasonable!  Their pizzas are really not bad.  and if you want cheap, you can get their family faves for $5 for a simple once topping - it's a pizza big enough for me and my husband to eat some and both have lunch the next day, so that's a deal in my book! Seriously, that's $1.25 a meal...."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and honestly was very impressed with the quality as well as the speed and the different deals if they offer, I liked \"baking\"everything at home it was nice."}
{"text":"Yup, I love this place.  Pizza's are great sizes with nice topping portions...."}
{"text":"Did a pineapple olives and spicy fennel sausage pizza was danklicious! Guy makin pizzas was super polite, funny and for workin solo banged the pizzas out. Will be back for the chicago style. If i may make one suggestion, get some wings!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza! They are super friendly and fast. These pizzas are made with fresh ingredients; nothing canned, and unlike the nasty pizza places out there. This is all fresh and made to order. Nothing is pulled out of a freezer, so they taste amazing! It's like a homemade pizza.The one on Stephanie street is not even like this location. This is high quality and the price you can beat. Definitely will come back, to this location. Glad they open one right up the street from me.

Again, super sweet team.  Wish service was like that everywhere I went.
When you leave they open the door for you, and say thank you."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here, pizza was AMAZING! The kids build you own pizza was adorable and my daughter had such a fun time making it. 

They allow you to use two coupons at a time, and when you check in on Yelp you get free cookie dough yum!!!"}
{"text":"Last two orders were wrong. One time had driven home, 8 miles to discover wrong pizza. Pizza is good, just poor management at this location."}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude employees. I ordered a pizza online on 4/11 for the first time at the recommendation of a friend, and gave it a few minutes extra past pick-up time. When I arrived, two employees were in the store, and only one other customer was in the store. When I informed the female employee (who was not attending to any other customers) that I had placed an order online AND ALREADY PAID,  and that I was here to pick up my order, she informed me that someone else was in the store first, and she could not help me, as there was another customer in the store. Really? That customer was being helped by Mr. General Manager Tom. I had already ordered and paid, the clerk was idle, and all she had to do was hand me my order. But she refused. Epitome of rudeness and laziness. She can't even perform a minimum-wage job properly. Wow."}
{"text":"Mo betta than Pizza Hut, Mo betta than Domino's, and Mo betta than Papa John' s (the other papa)'............ But you have to pick it up. 

The pizza is decent. Fresh ingredients, fast service and friendly staff what else can you ask for from a pizza joint. My rating is 3.5 stars, would give 4 stars if they add a delivery service. 

Got a combo and cheese pizzas. Combo definitely had much more toppings from those other chains and even grocery store brands. Kids said the Cheese Pizza was cheeeeeesy (not bad but the good cheesy). 

They also have salads and desserts (you can bake). Did not try either. 

Would go back again, if I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is much better than any of the chain pizza places. The text club makes it allot better. It is pricey compared to the big chains but I rather have the quality. The staff here is so friendly and they are really good with my son when I bring him in."}
{"text":"The Murphy's Crew at this mesa location represents Papa himself very well. What's not going to be easy for Kellen and her crew is the closure of Bashas within the same business zone. 
Still time will tell and I'll wager to bet that that this location will build on the indisputable seven year running Papa Murphys claim to fame for the Best Fresh take and bake pizza in north America. 
As for my pizza I'm always particular to whats being offered through their clip and save coupons in the circulars as well as whats provided with each pizza at time of take home. 
First time at this location I had the 6 dollar large single topping can't beat 80 pieces of premium peperoni and a pound of cheese yummy! 
Last Time in I had the 5-meat stuffed nearly five pounds of splendor in the oven just awaiting my final call for a perfect homebrowning,mmmm. you'll have to excuse me I need to take care of something now while their still open. 
Oh and additionally I have to rebuke the previous review, not for the reasons you think, but for the fact that they should have reviewed a Papas in their own hometown. It only seems fair that with all of her postings on pizza that its better to stay with specific pizza restaurants rather then national fresh take and bake chains. 
you won't get an argument from me that ultimately their two separate styles serving entirely different customer bases."}
{"text":"I am new to Las Vegas and have been to this location  twice. Both times I was greeted by tje same amazing friendly smile. Her name os Vernice I believe. And her work ethic and commitment to providing an amazing guest experience is awesome! As someone that works in the industry it is refreshing to meet someone so committed to providing the best guest experience possible. As a small business owner I believe these type of people are the foundation of which small franchise businesses like this hinge upon. Vernice gets it and I wanted to make sure she got the props she deserves!!!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't write this review because I had recently written one for an employee Vernice at a nearby location and didn't want to seem fraudulant. Today I got to meet Tyler a manager at the durango Location. I usually goto the one over on rainbow but was super happy to have seen the consistency between locations. Tyler demonstrsted all the qualities we look for not only in employees but in people in general. Not to mention the pan pizza is AHHHHmazing!!! I choose take and bake for its quality fresh ingredients but more imortantly because I believe they seek and hire young motivated indaviduals that display awesome core morals and values!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza take and bake is great! We have been gong to this location for years and the associates that prepare the pizzas are efficient and friendly. I also like the fact that they have specials and that customers are able to use coupons."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a Papa Murphy's to open within driving distance of where we live (The closest one before this location that we were aware of was almost 25 miles away), so I was pleased to find one just recently opened.

When I entered the manager (I'm guessing the owner of the franchise) was out and about among the people having conversations with them. Definitely a positive thing to see and shows he cares about making the place a success. When I got up to the register to order I noticed I wasn't offered a punch card or coupons like another customer was, so I had to request a punch card myself. Minor issue though, and understandable, that stuff happens time to time especially when it is busy like the place was getting.

Pizza was prepared quickly (got a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and what appeared to be a new pizza, the bacon bacon bacon.

The pepperoni pizza turned out really well, but the bacon bacon bacon had a lot to be desired, not sure if it was made improperly or it is standard, but it was overpowered by the onions on it. Besides the issue with the one pizza and having to ask about the punch card (forgot about asking about the coupons) it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Zero stars! I was excited to try it. I ordered it online so it could be ready when I got off work. Went to pick it up, and had to walk away empty handed, because the cash is locked in the office, and apparently the manager couldn't be bother to get it. Never coming back! Going to Grimaldi's instead!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm a frequent customer now that I can order and pay online then run in quickly to get my pizza. Being a picky Chicago native pizza lover this place is right up there with amazing quality and choice. Their $10 Tuesday deal is where it's at! The staff at this location is always kind and even goes so far as to hold the door open for their customers as they leave with pizza in hand."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, you're greeted by the staff and you'll notice that there are no tables around but a small area to sit. To the right, there's a \"pizza making bar\" with a splash guard and a small refrigerated area where you can pick up cheesy garlic bread sticks, cookies or salads.

The place is very clean and the concept is actually pretty cool! So you come in and the menu is on the wall, you pick your pizza and order and pay for it at the register, then once you've paid, you can watch them prepare your pizza, take it home and bake it! The only thing that sucks is that they really measure the exact amount of meat/cheese/veggies to the T. 

My husband and I got a thin large pizza that is half cowboy and half chicken garlic. On my husbands half, it hand about 10 small pieces of sausage and about 10 slices of pepperoni as well. My half of the pizza had 1/4 of a cup of chicken on it with a white garlic sauce. 

When my husband and I got home, we quickly preheated the oven and threw it in there to bake along with the 1/4 pound of cheese garlic bread! Both items baked came out perfectly! The crust of the thin pizza was amazing and crispy and the cheesy garlic bread has this amazing stringiness to it! You can tell their food is prepared fresh! All in all, it was delicious and we will definitely be coming back- especially on Tuesdays since a large pizza is $10.00!!!"}

+1 star for enabling my laziness
-1 star for every employee who looked decidedly unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quick and easy, can sit there and basically build the pizza yourself. Glad to have one so close. The owner is usually there and the staff are always clean and polite. Almost all the pizzas are under  10 bucks and they give a lot of coupons. 

The pizza itself is pretty damn good. I like the thin crust and the regular. Never tried the stuffed because ya usually just me. The side are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"A great local pizza spot in Huntersville that offers fresh ingredients that won't break the bank. Build your own or select a signature recipe and bring it home to bake. YUMMY. They even offer gluten-free crust, many sauce varieties, not just red, plenty of veggies/fruit and seasonings too. If you sign up for their email/text list you'll get great deals for your next take home order. Easy to follow baking instructions are provided. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their franchise and products. If they offered vegan cheese and organic veggies/fruit toppings it would be a home run. The place is really clean too. Not like other pizza spots where you see grease residue all over the walls and floors."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time one day because I was becoming bored with all of the other pizza parlor a around here. The staff working there was very quick in making sure our order was correct and ready to go.
When I got home, we cooked the pizza and it was really good. Would definitely come back here one day!"}
{"text":"Once again....a Fantastic Pizza made by AJ!!!!  If you've never had a pizza from here....you must try it!  There isn't a pizza place in Henderson or Las Vegas that even comes close to Papa Murphy's on Horizon Dr.  Everything is fresh and high quality.  I'm addicted to this place!  haha  :D"}
{"text":"Some incredible value can be found here! What you won't find here? An oven! That's right, you come here, get your pie, take it home, and bake it yourself. This really threw me for a loop the first time I stopped by a Papa Murphy's but when you get it home and bake it right, you're getting an extremely fresh pizza for a great price.

They assemble the doughy pizzas right in front of you and wrap them up. The staff here is very friendly and will make sure you know exactly how to bake the pizza. The instructions come with the directions for all of their styles so it's nice for them to make sure you're not baking a thin pizza with deep dish instructions.

My favorite is the thin crust. So crispy, almost like flatbread. The sauce is light and fresh, a bit peppery than most which I appreciate. The pepperonis get slightly crunchy on the edges if you bake it right and I love it.

Along with pizza, they also do cheese breads, salads, cookies, and cinnamon desserts. They have Pepsi products so keep that in mind if you're a Coke addict like me.

Check out their website for all kinds of different specials, offers, and coupons. They currently have a Yelp offer as well! I believe if you order online they also have a discount. Family size pies are $10 on Tuesdays. For as fresh of a product as your getting, the deals are a win-win.

So what's your excuse for not baking fresh pizza? Drop in here and be the 5-star chef your family deserves!"}
{"text":"Read carefully. It's TAKE AND BAKE pizza. Which means they make your pizza from scratch and THEN you take it home and cook it in your oven. I have seen some people come in and once they realize that it's a take 'n bake, they complain that they still have to take it home and bake it. The advantages are that it is a little cheaper and it doesnt get any fresher than it coming out of your own oven. You can come in and order what you want and it takes around 10 minutes for them to make it. You can save time by calling ahead and it will be done by the time you get there. The pizzas come on a specially designed disposable bake and serve trays so you dont have to go out and buy one. All the instructions you need come with the pizza. Look for the survey that comes with the instructions. You can get certain dollars off towards your next purchase if you complete it.

Now for the menu. They have 2 sizes: Large and Family size (which is 2 dollars more cuz it's 30 percent bigger).  3 kinds of crust. Regular, thin, and stuffed. 

The thin crust is 11 dollars. Choices are Herb Chicken Mediterranean, Chicken Bacon Artichoke, Thai Chicken, Gourmet Chicken Garlic, Veggie, and Meat.

The regular crust (also called Signature and Gourmet) is 13 dollars. Choices are Papa's Favorite, Murphy's Combo, Cowboy, Gourmet Chicken Garlic, Papa's All Meat, Gourmet Vegetarian, and Gourmet Classic Italian.

The stuffed crust is 14 dollars. Choices are 5 meat, Chicago Style, Chicken Bacon, and Big Murphy's.

For a more detailed description of  each pizza, go to www.papamurphys.com 
Remember, you can make any pizza a family size for 2 dollars more. Check often for they have different kinds of specialty pizzas all the time like my favorite, Cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"I've delt with PM in other locations and was happy with the results. I've gone to this location once and that was enough. I called for a vegie pizza. I wanted white sauce, tomatoes and Basil. I was told they \"don't have Basil! Shocked when I picked it up and it was 25$!  Sorry Charlie I can't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Always friendly & yummy! Thank you! Great service! The online ordering is super easy & accurate. Just a few clicks & run in and grab your pizza."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is a pizza place similar to those places that customize or create your pizza to your liking. The difference between this place and other pizza places is that you receive it uncooked and bake it at home yourself. 

I questioned myself, \"Why wouldn't I just go to a typical pizza place and get cooked pizzas?\"

Their pizzas don't disappoint! They have great taste and all you need is to follow the instructions they provide. The pizzas I picked up were Chicken Bacon Artichoke and Thai Chicken. I bought the large size of those pizzas and they serve about 4-6 people each. 

The Rainbow location I went to was very clean. I told the cashier that it was my first time and was told that this was a take and bake type of place to avoid any confusion people might have about this place. She was friendly and offered suggestions on what she liked and what was popular with customers.

Will be back to try the other signature pizzas."}
{"text":"Brand new food business!  They make you a pizza, you take it home and bake it.  It's a create your own pizza place...  As their name goes  Papa Murphy's \"Take N Bake!\""}
{"text":"Great clean store, Scott is the manager, he will make you feel right at home. His staff is very friendly and helpful in creating your pizza the way you like it. Then just take your pizza home and bake it. Don't forget to buy your soda and cookie dough on the way out. Great place, tell all your friends and family about it."}
{"text":"How many places have heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day?  Papa Murphy does!  They have thin crust, original, deep dish and even stuffed pizzas!  ...cookie dough too!

Of course you have to take them home and cook them yourself- but 15 minutes later you have freshly baked pizza!

Okay so it's better than frozen - but at least the original is average.  It is cost effective though!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good. Not way ahead of a frozen pizza in terms of taste but in terms of freshness it knocks frozen pizza out of the park! I like that you can have it made the way you want it. Overall, average pizza, average experience. It's all about convenience, but is it really more convenient than delivery?"}
{"text":"My mother loves this place. I personally find it weird that you buy an uncooked pizza then heat up your house baking it... (This is Arizona folks!) but it is I guess a decent idea if you don't mind cooking it yourself. They are pretty generous with the toppings and the toppings seem fresh and of good quality.  Our family favorites are the chicken artichoke and the Mediterranean. However, I am generally underwhelmed by customer service everytime I have been in Papa Murpheys. Just last night, my mother, my husband, and I went in to get a pizza and asked about the specials. Basically they gesture to the two signs... for our reading pleasure... (instead of, you know, advising us what the specials are).  And we end up getting a deep dish meat lovers pizza that was on special... for $14 for a family size not bad- but not something we would usually choose-- and when we leave and are driving home we see a $5 for large pizza deal on a sign one of their employees was holding outside on the street- which they never told us... really?! The truth is we probably would have bought a couple large pizzas instead. We also bought the s'mores dessert pizza and the cheesy bread. Which ended up being buy one ($4) get one side for $2 (a special we weren't told about until we checked out- but hey, I guess better late then never).  So that customer service glitch aside... The meaty deep dish pizza was quite tastey and filling. The cheesy bread had way too little cheese and was just okay- definitely would not purchase again. And the s'mores dessert pizza was actually quite tasty when it came out of the oven when it was all gooey with chocolate and marshmallow goodness- and it disappeared the fastest- no suprise there. :) So, all in all the pizza is pretty good and fresh but this is just not a place my husband and I go to ever on our own- we just don't love it like others seem to. We just get it when we visit my parents because my mom loves it. But I do feel it is worth a try. Just work on the customer service piece a bit more."}
{"text":"I really really like Papa Murphys. All i needed was crust, some cheese and chicken, went home and used all my leftover veggies in my fridge, made my own....came out great. I'm definitely going to do this again!!!!"}
{"text":"It's always something here. The first time I ordered a Herb Chicken Mediterranean delite I called in the order. When I arrived they didn't even have my order and then argued with me.  Whatever.  It didn't delay my plans too much
The second time, I walked in and received a free pepperoni pizza.  Cool!
The third time I ordered over the phone again and they forgot to add on the olives, but provided a little container of them for me.  ... Ok....?

The pizza is good, just don't call your order in because you're risking it being incorrect in some way."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The customer service given from employee Gwen was exceptional. The customer service from the assistant manager Philip was very unprofessional. He slammed his fist on the counter in front of me after taking a phone call that he was upset about. He seemed annoyed that he had to deal with my order. The next day I called the manager Isaiah and shared my customer service experience with him. He said he would talk with his assistant manager and go over his customer service skills. Not sure I will go back to this location."}
{"text":"Great weeknight fast pickup. Tuesday's they have a $10 any toppings special. I didn't understand the concept of this place until I had kids, husband, work, baseball practice and a house that constantly full of kids from the neighborhood. Now I totally get it and appreciate it."}
{"text":"We love the pizza. It's a great value for the price.  Watch out for specials and coupons. There is always a great deal going on."}
{"text":"This is a subway build your own pizza take-n-bake.  It's a great concept for those that love to make their own pizza without the mess.  Don't be swayed from the reviews and try it for yourself as I am a fan."}
{"text":"Recent and good addition to the neighborhood.

This is the most recent addition to the Cornelius dining scene although I've had pizza from the Mooresville location a couple of times. I think this one has been her for about a week now although it tucked away back in the Magnolia Estates Center, very easy to miss and it might be older.

If you've been to the Mooresville location, the first thing that hits you when you walk into this location is that it appears to be a newer motif. Same great products, just a different look.

For those not familiar with the style, you order a fresh customized pizza which they assemble on site to your specifications and then you take home and throw it into you over for a set time and in the end, hot fresh customized pizza.

Walked in and after looking around and getting my bearing, proceeded to the counter to place  my order. Decided on the Papa's Favorite which has many of my favorites but my wife would not like it because of the olives. The young lady at the counter did persuade me to up size to the family which granted is the best buy but I had no idea how large it is. If you have a crowd, this is the one to go with.

I also ordered a Mediterranean Salad for my wife but was able to customize and have it made without olives and no dressing since she has her own.

Interesting process to observe. There was a minor mistake made in making my pizza but they caught it before I did and they apologized and said to give them a few minutes to make the correction which I did.

I appreciate that. They have the QC to catch errors, If an error occurs, they correct that. They also do not conceal why it is taking longer to make a customers pizza. 

Honesty and I like that.  The manager in apologizing offered me some of their Cookie Dough as compensation for not being timely which I refused but in the end I did agree to give it a try.

At one time, the manager asked why I was coming here rather than Mooresville and the answe was simple. I live just a couple of minutes away from here while Mooresville can take 15 -20 minutes to get there. 

I will be back to this place shortly"}
{"text":"Sign up for their mobile coupons! Great one day deals tend to pop up.

Papa Murphy's is a decent neighborhood place. Build your pizza and then take it home to bake it.  It is hot and perfect.  They include great baking directions.  On this visit, I used the $5 any pan pizza coupon.  I got the cowboy pizza, a mix of meat and veggies.  Their new pizza is delicious.  Great, thick crust and generous toppings.  The cowboy pizza had pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and more.  

However, the cooking is kind of complex.  You have to remove the pan pizza from its pan in order to serve it.  That gets cumbersome.  The line is never too long and you can always call ahead.  I would recommend this for a quick week night dinner."}
{"text":"So you have a long day at work, you race to Pappas to get there in time and you walk in 13min before they close, yu just want a pizza.......................everything is cleaned up, all food is gone no  people.  I yell and this young kid comes out and says we are closed, I say but I have 13 min and he says no were closed and done for the night.  I then ask if there is ANYTHING I could get and all I got was nope and he returned to the back where the rest were sitting around talking about must have been the long hard day!!!!~!Really??? This is like that \"hamburger \"place that swears they don't have a sausage biscuits at 1031!!! I was so angry they closed early and the attitude of the employee that never again Pappas there are too many places to deal with this crap.  I read the other blogs and just do not believe we are talking about the same place because if you treat me right I will rave, treat me wrong and I will go on and on.  August 18 at 7:48!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here & I usually receive great customer service. But tonight I was a little taken back by the cashiers attitude. She was very soft spoken & I had to lean in to hear her. Once she noticed me doing so, she laugh a sarcastic laugh and rolled her eyes. I know a job like hers is only while she's in HS and it's really not a big deal but its hard to watch this new generation treat people the way they do.  The entitlement they have. It's just sad."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I'm assuming she is the manager, middle-aged asian lady (I wish I gave a crap enough to find out her name, now) RUDE RUDE RUDE every single my family comes in...if it wasn't for it being the only close Papa Murphys, I'd NEVER go back..I hate going in just because of her horrible attitude. She won't smile and greet you, not a \"how are you doing tonight?\" Nothing. She stands there with a rude look on her face and argues EVERYTIME I use a coupon that the WEBSITE offers, or when I get text message coupons..I feel like telling her \"I didnt just make this coupon up out of my ass, its something the company offers so why are you telling me I can't use it and being reluctant?\" 
She finally gives in because she knows she has to acknowledge them, but she's genuinely mad for no reason besides I wanted to use my 10$ Tuesday coupon... Makes me fear to want to use my \"10$ Tuesday coupon\" or my \"3$ off family size pizza\"...the company offers these, I shouldn't have to worry about ordering the pizza with a coupon, in fear she's going to be a rude bitch, like she always is...I don't like using such negative words but that's literally the nicest thing I can come up with after my 25+ visits. \"Rude bitch\".  Seriously only go because its the only one by my house and I looove the pizza!! A \"Hi how are you doing?\" And a smile would go a loooong way! I could almost deal with the angry attitude just because I want to use a coupon that the COMPANY SENDS me...but she can't even have decent customer service to top it off....makes the whole process of ordering dinner cringe worthy.."}
{"text":"This is kind of a neat concept but I've heard people say they order pizza so they won't have to cook.  Well, if you order delivery, you have to WAIT, so listen up!

My fiance' and I went in to pick up a couple of pizzas off of their coupon specials.  We were greeted at the door by the owner.  She walked us through the process (since we had never done this before) which was extremely simple.  We ordered, we waited about 5 minutes and our pizzas were ready, freshly prepared right in front of us.

We got home, stuck one of them in the oven (the other in the freezer for later) and it was ready in about 15 minutes.  Quicker than delivery!  BEST PIZZA I'VE PROBABLY EVER HAD!  The ingredients were fresh, the crust was amazing and I will be a regular!  

Don't think you want to cook it yourself?  Then suffer with the bad pizza deliveries out there, I'm going to Papa Murphy's!  =)"}
{"text":"First experience with \"take and bake\" concept last night.  Excellent experience and pizza.  We ordered a large thin crust with each half having different toppings.  Very fresh toppings with generous helpings of each topping.  On my vegetarian side, baby spinach leaves, fresh tomato in a small dice so that it doesn't make the pizza too wet, thinly sliced mushrooms, green peppers.  The meat side was loaded with 4 kinds of meat.  Two layers of cheese - a generous layer of mozzarella on the bottom, then an additional layer of mixed mozzarella and cheddar on the top.

Regular price would have been $14 but we had a coupon from local paper for 50% off.  And every Tuesday they offer $10 large pizzas.

We have had a difficult time finding a tasty thin crust pizza in the LKN area.  This was the best we have eaten.  And the staff was very helpful with the whole ordering process and with the home baking instructions."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's pizza, maybe it's nostalgia from my childhood but I still think their pizza is delicious! For anyone who has yet to try Papa Murphy's they only sell uncooked pizzas, you have to take them home and bake them.

The staff at this location were friendly and quick. They also keep the location very clean. The prices are average for pizza. My favorite is the gourmet vegetarian, and create your own family size with garlic white sauce, pepperoni, salami, bacon, and jalapeños. 

This location also has online ordering so when you come in your pizza is already made and paid for."}
{"text":"Tonight was not a very good expanse one crew member was very short and rude. Then when I we got home cooked our pizza we found a light colored blond long blond hair in our pizza very very nasty. I could not call because we picked it up just before they closed and the time we got home and cooked them they were gone or didn't answer at least."}
{"text":"Every time we get food from this Papa Murphy's location, our service is stellar. The manager has even run our food out to us in the parking lot before we could come back in to pick up our order. From beginning to end, the crew is always super friendly and willing to engage in a positive customer service experience. The pizza is always fresh and yummy. This location has customers for life."}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place when we don't want to go out.  We have been buying Papa Murphys pizza for many years.  This location is the best.  The employees are always so polite and greet everyone as they come in. I have tried most of the take out pizzas in Surprise and Papa Murphys is the best."}
{"text":"After writing the review the Manager of the store contacted me and went out of his way to make things right by replacing my pizza and making it how I ordered it. The following day he called me back again to just make sure that I was happy with the pizza he replaced. I will be a returning customer for sure."}
{"text":"I'm used to ordering pizza over the phone and waiting for it to be delivered.  This was a new concept to me, ordering the pizza, watch them make it just like I want it and then, taking it home to bake it.  The service was great - absolutely fantastic.  The pizza was really yummy.  It took only about 15 minutes to bake and we had a fresh out of the oven delight!  And the price was right, too.  I will come back here for my pizza.  It's the best."}
{"text":"Have to say hands down the best customer service I've seen in awhile. I go to this location at least once or twice every two weeks. An the same amazing customer service I get each and every time. Plus the amazing pizza..life time customer right here"}
{"text":"Parents picked up a pizza for me and family.  The take and bake was really good!!! Fresh tasting!!!"}
{"text":"Finally came in after hearing nothing but good things about this place. It lived up to its expectations. Ordering was easy and the customer service was impeccable. The worker Mathieu was very helpful and friendly. Will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"They make great pizza and it's very tasty!

I love that you can get them to make the pizza and you take it home and cook it in the oven. You know it's fresh and can make it just how you like."}
{"text":"Ok, let's keep this simple and to the point! Their thin crust pizza is just good. It's fresh and you can bake it to as crispy as you like. We have picked up pizza 3 times since they opened and enjoyed all of them. A ton better than frozen and way cheaper than restaurant take out. This is currently our go to take out pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty self explanatory when you get inside. Offers fresh pizzas you take home and cook. 
I like the taste but I know people who aren't really a fan. Convenient if you don't know when guests are arriving."}
{"text":"Always a great selection for dinner.  Nothing better then a fresh baked pizza in your own oven.  Boy does it make your house smell wonderful."}
{"text":"I have to start off by giving this store 5*stars! Every time me and my family come here it's always last minute but they do there best to accommodate our needs. On more then one occasion we were five minutes away from closing time but the workers waited for us to put our order in before closing for the evening. I also forgot my debit card but already placed my order so the workers happily held my PiZzAs for me. Even at its busiest hours they still manage to give the friendliest service. (And GrEaT FOOD!!)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night. All large pizzas are 10$. Got the chicken bacon artichoke thin crust. Pizza was amazing then thin crust was the way to go. Also got a large pan cheese. So I was thinking this must taste like frozen pizza it has too. Nope was awesome, the crust was nice a buttery. Trick is pull it out of the oven remove the pan so it stops cooking. Just keep an eye on the pizza it would suck to burn your 10$ investment."}
{"text":"The location is great.  The cheesy bread is awesome and the pizzas come out perfect at home.  Fresh ingredients and a great  price. Very friendly staff and I have been there 5 times.  I'm so glad they are here! ."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first about take home and bake pizza but Since my first pizza, I've been frequenting this establishment.  The quality of the ingredient and the price is hard to beat."}
{"text":"Tasty best cure for a hangover... too bad they charge for extra pizza sauce :("}
{"text":"I am posting an update for two reasons:
1. Their customer service is great.
2. With coupons and special offers, we are able to receive a large pepperoni pizza and a container of cookie dough for $5.06 with tax. You cannot beat that.

Still not my favorite pizza, but I throw a little oregano on it and it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I get this every couple of months or so.  We are big fans of Grimaldi's and Novecento, but there are times when we just want to hang out at home and enjoy a freshly baked pizza.

Of course, getting delivery would be \"easier,\" but I always feel so disgusting after eating greasy delivered pizza (even though it satisfies a craving once in a blue moon).  Papa Murphy's is about 10 minutes away.  We make a phone call and it's ready for pick up.  In our oven, it takes only about 12 minutes to get a nice crisp crust.  

We find that because it's fresh, it's not greasy.  The toppings have always been good.  We tend to get supreme.  The sauce it yummy, slightly tart.

Yes, we consider ourselves \"foodies.\"  Yes, we enjoy our NY or Neopolitan style pizza above everything else.  There are just those times when we want pizza but don't want greasy delivery and a frozen grocery store pizza won't cut it, so we go to Papa Murphy's!"}
{"text":"The most AMAZING pizza ever. They have the freshest ingredients and they always get it right. Their customer service is superior and they are very economical. My son loves the kids pizza and the fact he can make it at home. Smores pizza is to die for. Go and you want be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get how this pizza has 5 stars. It's not that good. I make better pizza at home. We were excited to try this Pizza and were really disappointed. Not worth the money. I can just make my own and save $$$$."}
{"text":"Fast, quick, convenient! Awesome staff! It's nice that there is a Fry's next door so if you need, you can get what you need and when you come back your pizza is done and ready to go! I highly recommend their salads too, always fresh and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Pizza good. Salad much smaller than it used to be. Wilted. Now they charge for dressing"}
{"text":"Pizza made quickly and ready to go.  Seemed a little short on ingredients but tasted good."}
{"text":"Great pizza,  friendly employees, and quick service.  I tend to only use my military discounts on bigger purchases so I rarely use them at restaurants.  The employee noticed I was using my USAA card and offered a military discount.  Pretty cool I thought.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Was charged 16% sales tax?! \"Thats what cash register says.\". \" Well OK but cash register is wrong\"..When getting pizza,\"oops that register/computer was wrong,will leave a note\".. Hmmmm,what about the many many previous customers?..\"Oh well\"    Pizza was great as usual tho."}
{"text":"Always very friendly and courteous staff here. They really load the pizza's and I prefer to cook it myself so I know we can eat it hot rather than arriving home with lukewarm carry out. Only complaint, no fault of there's, is good luck trying to head westbound on Baseline once you leave. The traffic is crazy at rush hour and the exits out of that southwest corner are not very practical."}
{"text":"Great location,, I love the drive-thu window! The staff is very friendly. They gave us a keychain card so we get $2 off every pizza every time!"}
{"text":"Never got a bad pizza but I burned a few for sure. My bad.  
Papa Murphy's product is first rate.  Generous toppings.  Fresh ingredients. Always use the coupons!  It'll save you a lot of $ over time.  
Their pizza is better than all the other chain pizza product \"out there\"
HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the whole fact that I can create my own pizza with whatever toppings I want while also being able to choose the different types of crust. 

If I'm not in the mood to create my own my go to items are the Artichoke Chicken Thin Crust or the Stuffed 5-Meat! Both of them I enjoy thoroughly. And then to top it off they have delicious desert pizzas. I love the Cinnamon Wheel but they also have a S'mores one too and Cheesey Bread. 

The staff at this store is very friendly and treat you with the best customer service, even opening the door for you when your hands are full carrying out the handmade deliciousness. 

The other part I love about Papa Murphy's is that it is also baked to perfection! Only because you get to take it home and bake it yourself! Lol."}
{"text":"Great place to get quality pizzas.

We ordered 3 pizzas and each of them were so delicious. 

Be careful ordering the extra thin, crust may rip while taking it off the pan. 

Would come and visit again, next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"I think the \"effort\" it takes to drive to get my order instead of having my pizza delivered is worth it after trying Papa Murphy's. The order and pick up process it easy, you can even call in your order so there is less wait time at the location. The pizzas are made to order depending on size, crust, sauce, and toppings. Cook time is short and the pay off is a pleasant tasting crust, not a lot of grease, fresh tasting toppings and fresh from the oven- no worries as to how long your pizza has been out of the oven or who touched it or how it was tortured on the speedy car ride to your house. Just order, pay, bake, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time trying the pizza and it's awesome. They load the toppings and the price is great! The whole family loved the pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetable pizza from here last night. Although I asked for \"regular\" (for lack of a better work) crust, I got a super thin crust. It was not a very good pizza. In fact when it was cooked, it was soggy and flavorless. Almost as if I was eating cooked dough with vegetables on it. 

My husband said their pepperoni pizza was delicious. So, I've clearly learned my lesson to stick with my tried and true fav from a noisy little arcade/pizza joint."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Papa Murphy's. This is the only location I've ever been to, and I miss it every day since I moved. TOPPINGS!!! No shortage here. Unique combinations such as the Thai Pizza, and options when it comes to crust/sauce/cheese. The vegetarian pizzas are delicious, both the thin and thick crust options. You may already be aware, but this is a take home and bake spot, which is very convenient if you're planning on pizza but want to pick it up early in the day. They prepare it in front of you, unless you order pick-up. They also have a kids option in which they package the toppings and provide a kids size pizza to build at home with your little one. Fun! And delicious. This location has super friendly and attentive service!"}
{"text":"Glad to have this pizza \"to go\" joint in the neighborhood.  They just opened in May 2012, and I got one of their grand opening special prices for a large pepperoni.
They got one of the most important things right: excellent quality cheese and plenty of it!  The sauce was very good, but just a little too spicy.  The regular crust I had was very nice.  Next time, I might try the thin crust, but I will definitely be a regular as long as the quality is there."}
{"text":"hello I went there last night to get a pizza I go the meatlovers one yum yum  its so much like subway you can order on line or go and pick it up either way it was a  good  night"}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for some time, since it seems like an interesting concept. They make the pizza there for your and then you take it home and cook it yourself. Ordered a $14 medium cowboy special. The establishment is clean and the staff is amicable, but quiet and non-engaging.

Pizza came with instructions on how to cook. So there's that.

Here's the issue with this entire scenario; Papa Murphy's is located in the same shopping center as Smiths. Based on the taste of the pizza, we would have ben much better served just getting the ingredients ourselves. If I wanted so-so pizza with a very salty sauce, I can order from a chain and get it delivered in less time than it took to bake it at home, and for a cheaper price.

Also, you can get a far superior pizza at Costco for much less. So there's just really no point to go here. All negatives and no positives gets a red light from us.

At least we tried it, and there's no more curiosity as to how it is. Take a page from us and skip it."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly and fresh.  I still prefer their Chicken Garlic pizza over any already made and hot pizza delivered to my door.  I always start off with a chop salad as well as the cheesy bread.  Great appetizers while my fresh pizza is cooking in the oven!!"}
{"text":"Back in home in Washington State, I always loved Papa Murphy's.  But since I left in 2007, I wasn't sure if I would ever see a Papa Murphy's.  But after a few searches, there happens to be one, just a few miles from me.  I was really stoked.  

Located on Decatur and Craig, right across the parking lot of Albertsons is a small and hidden Papa Murphy's.  In a way, it was convenient for me, since I live off Decatur.  But if you live in the north end, it's in a pretty open space and right off the road of Craig.  Enough parking, but small waiting area.  Inside, it's well decorated for people to understand what's going on.  Decent color scheme, and a bench to sit and wait.  

I got there and looked at the menu, which is right at the counter.  Ordered a Chicago Style Pizza and the pricing was decent.  I notice that they have some pizza all prepped out in the fridge they have.  Some customers came in and ordered, a pepperoni pizza.  The cashier turned around and pulled out the pizza and the next minute, you got a happy customer walking out with a prepped out pepperoni pizza.  Unfortunately I had to stay a little bit longer for my pizza to be made.  But it didn't really take them long to make it.  I was probably in and out in 5 minutes.  

Went home, popped it in the oven, and 30 minutes later, we got a very well made Chicago Style Pizza.  The crust was very good as I remembered it.  Just the right amount of meat and cheese.  It made my day.  

Overall, I would recommend this, if you like Papa Murphy's.  They have good customer service and friendly.  They are quick on making your order.  You can also call ahead of time, so when you get there, its all prepped and ready.  The end result, a pizza that will taste great out of the oven."}
{"text":"Great pizza and customer service. All of the ingredients are fresh and it is so easy to bake at home. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"So the idea of take and bake is a new concept to Americans, especially when it comes to Pizza. But the idea has been tired and I am SOLD!
My friends and I always like to get a pizza at home watch a movie and hang out with our combined 5 dogs. But pizza can be expensive, $20 or more.
We gave Papa Murphy's a try and found that $14.99 (full price, although we had a coupon) and baking it at home was a winning combination!
We had the Chicken and Garlic Stuffed pizza. It was creamy and oh so flavorful, with a combination of garlic sauce and cheese. There were tons of fresh ingredients; we actually watched it being made. We ordered the family size, and there were tons of leftovers, which always makes us happy!
I would highly recommend Papa Murphy's, the pizza is great and less expensive."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good and the service is okay. I usually stick with the cheesy bread because it's defiantly the best thing they have. If you go close to closing time don't be surprised if the staff tries to sell you a pre made pizza for a deal. I tried to negotiate it down even further then the what they offered but they didn't budge but they still do give a good deal. But it does seem if you go in late that they are hesitant to to make you a new one, especially if they have already started to clean. But they do offer 25% off if you order online which is a great deal."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than what I expected. I have seen Papa Murphy's at several locations but did not really understand the concept or gave much effort in understanding. But received a coupon for a free pizza and cookie dough so on a lazy week night I decided to get the pizza instead of cooking. 
The store was very clean and the employees were very helpful. The employees promptly took my order and made my pizza right in front of me. I just opted for a plain pepperoni pizza. The process took every bit of 10 minutes if that, the employee wrapped my pizza up and told me I could grab a tub of cookie dough behind me in the refrigerated shelves. The tray the pizza sits on was a little flimsy so I had to be careful carrying it. 
The instructions are included in the packaging and I went home and put the tray and pizza in the oven for about 10 minutes and it was ready. The pizza was bubbled up which made me panic but eventually went down after I took it out of the oven. 
Over all the pizza was good for a take home pizza. There are a lot of deals and coupons that can make this a cheap dinner or lunch. The pizza seems fresher than a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is my absolute favorite pizza place! Not only is the pizza super delicious at a great price, but the crew at this store is just phenomenal. Every time I stop by (which is frequently!), I have had a great customer service experience. All the staff are young, but very professional and courteous. They are super friendly and always make an effort to have an actual conversation with me, which I really appreciate.  

As other reviewers have mentioned, the crew is extremely helpful and always takes the time to walk me through the menu and suggest great new items to try! I highly recommend this store and will continue to be a regular, VERY satisfied customer! I love the special shaped pizzas they have during holidays (Valentine's day heart pizza, Halloween jack-o-lantern pizza) and the s'mores pizza is the probably the tastiest thing I've ever eaten...ever :)"}
{"text":"I ordered from here today, the driver was given the wrong address so my order was very late and I was delivered luke warm food."}
{"text":"This pizza was amazing! And very well may be our new favorite pizza place in Huntersville!! The amount of vegetables they put on our pizza was insane!! I'm used to getting veggie pizzas and they are a hit or miss because of the quality of veggies. No canned veggies except the artichokes. Even the mushrooms were fresh!! The price was good too! Only $14 for a family size pizza which fed my husband and I for 2 meals! We will definitely be back this Friday!!"}
{"text":"Where to start... The food is exceptional! This place has literally transformed my understanding of what good pizza is and how it should taste. To all the lazy naysayers, get off your butt and heat up your oven. After a mouthful of the freshest pizza ever, you will never call for delivery again. The people who work there are so nice, friendly and willing to make your pizza HOWEVER you want it. The owner is so nice and energetic, chatting with customers while working the line with everyone else. I am so happy this place has found it's way into my neighborhood, you have converted my blase friday night pizza habit into something I look forward to all week. If I could give you more than 5 stars I would! Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"The customer service is great n the pizza is hands down the best take out pizza around, better then domino, pappa johns, n pizza Hut. There ingredients are fresh and the use high quality ingredients the cheese is amazing definitely been my new every Sunday football pizza. Give it a try they don't disappoint.."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time. GREAT service, quick and clean food prep, will be back!"}
{"text":"Thin crust, deep dish, regular crust...Papa Murphy's gets down!! This is such a beautifully simple idea that his the nail on the head! TAKE'N'BAKE pizza is the shizz and Papa Murphy's is definitely the best I've had in AZ anytime recently. 

VERY inexpensive and always reliable. Easy to feed a whole squad for a little cash and its honestly good pizza. If you don't like it, check yo mouf!!"}
{"text":"As the name says, they make the pizza then you take it home and bake it.  Interesting concept.

I think it's a little pricey, but they put on a LOT of toppings.  Their largest size barely fits in our oven (which is a standard wall oven).  But it fits.  They put it on a baking tray for you, but after about 8-10 minutes you want to take it off the tray so the bottom of the crust will firm-up a bit.  You can leave it on the tray, but it will come out limp.  Cooked, but limp.  Transferring to the oven rack resolves that problem.  It is easy to tear the crust doing this, so be careful (or put the tray on a rack below the pizza to catch anything that may drip).  We ripped one because we tried to move it too soon.

The pizza itself is very tasty.  Toppings seem fresh, and the sauce is good.  And I prefer eating at home anyway!

There are coupons available pretty regularly (mail flyers and such), which make it a bit less pricey."}
{"text":"We love this location! Seriously it's a take home pizza shop so why five stars THE MANAGER IS AWESOME!! We love how she remembers us every time we come in and always double checks our dietary needs. We don't eat cheese or meat and we are always given ideas and options that we may never have thought of. Thank you for the great service!!"}
{"text":"This Place is amazing!!!!! I'd seen the commercials but didn't know what this was. It turns out there was a location not too far from an area I frequent. The indside doesn't look like much, and neither does the raw pizza for that matter. BUT once you bake, the finished product comes out like a huge pillow of goodness.
I love their origianal crust because it rises really high around the edges. It's crispy on the outside and soft inside. YES, it stays soft the next day when you heat up the leftovers. All you need is one slice, it is that thick and hearty. A family size cheese is $10 then you can take home and top with your own toppings and bake, this is wayyyy better than any frozen pizza you can buy.
I do end up using my own metal pizza pan that has holes on the bottom (I did this because the first time I didn't realize you can bake pizza in container in comes in. oops), I liked that concept and continue doing this every time I bring one home. I don't know if this makes a difference but maybe next time I will try to just bake it in the container that it comes in. Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you read my profile, you'd see that I anticipate my last meal being some type of pizza. If I have the option, you can bet it will be from Papa Murphy's!

If you're not familiar with Papa Murphy's, they are a \"take and bake\" pizza place, meaning that you get your pizza prepared at the shop, take it home, and bake it yourself. This helps drive down the extra costs you incur when you order delivery.

The pizzas themselves are FANTASTIC! They have several different styles of crust from which you can choose: Thin, Hand-Tossed, or Stuffed. The first two types are pretty self-explanatory. But the \"Stuffed\" pizza is a completely different beast. It's essentially a pizza within a pizza. I can only confirm that it looks incredible...I'd never be brave enough to actually try it. I'm afraid I might have a heart attack after the first bite!

The pizza with which I am the MOST familiar is the Chicken Bacon Artichoke. It comes on a thin crust, and it's absolutely LOADED with the aforementioned toppings. We, being a family of three, usually opt for the Family Size pizza. Though, sometimes it feels like that might be a bit much...but it's just so good! 

Now, this location is newly opened. Of course, the facility is in immaculate condition. My initial fear was that the new location meant new employees. But, it appears that they may have imported experienced people from different locations. Upon entering, every person in the joint greeted me. Each employee was well-versed in their craft, as every pizza they made while I was there looked AMAZING! There were even a couple of the employees in the background showing off their pizza-crust-spinning abilities! (MAN I wish I could do that!)

Now, the thing that sets this place apart, for me, is what happens AFTER they finish making your pizza. They wrap the pizza, and they always double-check to make sure you know how to prepare the dish when you get home...after all, not everybody is a pizza lush like me!!! After they're sure you know what you're doing, they walk your pizza around the counter, hand it to you, and then they hold the door open for you!!! I know it doesn't seem like THAT big of a gesture, but when you're trying to hold a man-hole-cover sized pizza in one hand, and a three year old in the other, that gesture makes all the difference in the world!

I've been to Papa Murphy's all across the country. Before this location opened up, the closest one to me was the one on Union Hills. Now that this location has opened up on Greenway, I fear for my waistline. I am certain to have to double up on those self-control exercises...otherwise, this place WILL be the last meal I eat!"}
{"text":"Until around two months ago this would have been 5 stars. We buy a pizza here at least once a week. Despite the staff assurances that the same measurements are used every time, we're finding it hit and miss of late. One week it will beat out Rosati's or Oregano's, the next it will just be so-so. This is due to the amount of tomato sauce used on the pizza. Sometimes it's the perfect amount, others far too little - meaning it just doesn't have the right jing. When we complained the first time we received a $4 coupon, which was nice, but not the point. The second time I was told 'If you want more sauce you have to ask for it.' Be that as it may, and in the future we certainly will, why the inconsistency if exactly the same measurements are used every time? Obviously this is a cop out. So 3 stars, and I am very sorry to have to do it. The virtually sauceless pizza is on a par with any of the other glut of Pizza houses - good, but nothing special. The saucier 'original recipe' pie was the best pizza ever for 4 years straight, and was, until recently, peerless."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place.  The pizza is ALWAYS good and at a great price.  We always prefer it over any pizza place in town and rather than buying a frozen pizza in the store.  Plus, they always have nice staff and good deals - $10 any pizza/any size on Tuesdays (and sometimes they put a sign out for a cheaper deal) and then $5 large pizzas (sausage, pepperoni or cheese) on Fridays.  AND cisaves.com has good deals for them right now."}
{"text":"I always get physically sick when I eat the food from here. Maybe it's the white pizza sauce I get? I mean, either way, it's really not worth getting sick."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm so good. They are very fast with our order and get it right every time. They have personal, build your own pizza, for kids. It comes with a sticker. They're salads are fresh and anything you need is in site."}
{"text":"This branch just opened recently within the past month or so. Whether you call ahead or pick up pizza on the go, the people that work here are very friendly and quick! They are very good about greeting you when you come in, and not just one person, everyone that works there greets you. 

The set up is very straight forward and the setting is very clean and organized. Whenever I can't think of food to bring home, this is always an easy back up plan. I know it seems silly to have to cook your own pizza, but trust me, the directions are so clear, it's very difficult to mess up, and you don't have to worry about your pizza becoming soggy when you drive it home. The pizza comes perfect out of the oven when you cook it at home and looks restaurant quality and tastes fresh and great as well!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty friendly and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my pizza. It is a take it and bake it yourself place so I do wish it was slightly cheaper since you are doing most of the work but they always have coupons everywhere! Just check online before you go or check the in the mail. They often have coupons there too."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here!  I haven't had a problem with topping amounts or anything like that.  The toppings are of good quality and the veggies are crisp when I have eaten them.  I spoke with the owner of this location and she was very pleasant.  The people always seem to be in good spirits and the store seems clean to me.  I don't know what the people who rated it less than 4 stars had a problem with but I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Love, love the family that owns this store. Very kind and funny. Quick orders are made. Our fave pizza place!  Laurie and John"}
{"text":"VERY INTERESTING

Roomie wanted a pizza from here so got to discover this place close to our house. A very interesting concept I would say. We ordered a half red sauce & half white sauce pizza. You order your style & then they pack it up so that you could go bake it at home yourself.

The favor was good & the dough had a crisp since we got the thin style. Still there was some dough to chew as well. 

Concept is cute our pizza was $14 so it's nice when you could create your own style & just take it home to bake w/o the hassle of having to make the dough & everything =]"}
{"text":"Of course the pizza here is great! I always get the mediterranean delight but with roma tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes. To die for! The only reason this pace isn't getting 5 stars is because of the rude staff. The last time we went in to order pizza they literally had the music so loud we could barely order and had to keep asking the girl up front what she was saying."}
{"text":"Always quick, convenient, fresh, fast and tasty.  Super nice folks."}
{"text":"Pizza is so delicious I never thought I would buy pizza and have to cook it at home on my own but the ingredients are all fresh the dough was fresh. Pizza is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Pizza s good.  I like the fact that it is made on the spot and you customize it to your liking."}
{"text":"OMG Matt is AWESOME!! I ordered a pizza and it was the wrong order but Matt took GREAT care of me in which now, I am happy to continue giving my business to this Establishment!!

The Cashier, is so nice and friendly . Customer service is awesome here!! I definitely recommend coming to this location!"}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients, friendly staff, fast service, great pizza. What more can you ask for? I don't understand the people who are complaining about how they have to cook the pizza themselves. Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc don't compare. Sure, you can lay on your sofa and have limp, cold, cardboard-like pizza delivered to your door.  Or you can call Papa Murphy's, drive a few minutes to pick it up, then pop it in your oven and have fresh, hot, delicious pizza in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"We love their pizza, always fresh, always delicious. The staff there is very friendly and accommodating. We go there almost every Friday night and we've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! If it wasn't for the excellent Yelp reviews I would have never stopped in but Yelpers are right again! We ordered the BIG MURPHY'S STUFFED Pizza that had red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, olives inside then topped with green peppers, tomatoes, provolone, cheddar, herb & cheese blend. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! Just as fellow Yelpers report everything was fresh and the employees are super friendly and helpful and will happily answer your questions. The directions on how to cook the pizza is in the packaging and was simple and precise. It comes on a tray that gets put in the oven.  You can have them cook it, but boy do I love this concept because when you are ready to eat just throw it in the oven and bam! its hot and fresh instead of it getting cold and soggy by the time you get it home. Look forward to trying the New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Super slooooww and the manager or supervisor, whatever he is, is openly racist. Doesn't matter if you were there first, if you're a minority, you will get bumped in line.  Wish there was another location close because this one SUCKS."}
{"text":"My wife called in a pizza order at 5:30 for me to pick up after a client appointment at 5:45.  When I arrived at 5:50 and paid for my order I was informed that they had not even started the pizza yet. 20 minutes later and after about a half-dozen customers coming through, ordering, and receiving their pizza- mine still was not ready.  I finally asked for a refund and headed out. Definitely will not visit this Papa Murphy's again!"}
{"text":"I had to update my review as I just tried something new. It's their Pan pizza. I never really cared for thick crust but kind of like Jets.  And I love Papa Murphy's so  try it I did. I followed the directions,  take pie out of pan when it comes out of oven and the crust was out of this world. You will never have a Pan pie anywhere else again."}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars if I could. For medical reasons (CD), I must avoid even a trace of gluten. When I informed the staff, they were extra careful to avoid cross-contamination. Whenever I go back,  they do the same thing, even when I  order from their Web site - they recognize my name and order.. This is remarkably considerate. 

So, not only do I get good pizza quickly, but also I know it is safe for me."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location my pizza takes forever to get made. Today I ordered a cowboy with no black olives add onions. The same person who took my order made my pizza and still put black olives on it. I would have had them make me another one but I didn't want to wait any longer. I was the only one in line so they weren't busy. If you're dead set on going here, order it in advance! Not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I am so happy Papa Murphy's came to our part of town! For newbies like me, they create the pizza in shop and you take it home and bake it. It is perfect for me and the boyfriend as they will make a pizza 3/4 pepperoni with no complaints leaving me happy with cheese and him happy with pepperoni. The staff is friendly. The coupons or deals are normally pretty good. It is more expensive than the Domino's $5 large, but I think the quality shows. Love being able to cook the pizza as long as I like. For fast food, I think Papa Murphy's is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I think her name was Shane that helped me and my wife and let me tell you she was amazing and our pizza tastes as good as the service. Well done !"}
{"text":"Super friendly team.  Brandy was very accommodating for requests and patient. Glad to have a location closer to home.  Definitely will come back.

Also, Brandy knew of a previously poor experience we had at another location.  Apologized for their shortfalls and provided an added treat. Genuinely interested in what had happened and requested feedback.  

Again, super sweet team.  Wish service was like that everywhere I went."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Papa Murphy's has finally made it to Huntersville. This is hands down the BEST take and bake pizza you can get. The ingredients are quality and they have a lot of different options. This is a much healthier choice when it comes to pizza. Less grease and honestly better tasting then many of the commercial pizza joints."}
{"text":"Just tried this place - thought it might be a hokey premise but man, is it good! Basically, they make fresh pizza in front of you and you cook it at home. We had a pepperoni and the med special (spinach/feta/chicken/sun dried tomato). 

The appeal is really that the pizza gets done how you want it - crispy, soft crust whatever. . .our whole family loved it! I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to bake and the price is reasonable.

Finally, the owners are really eager to please and were very good about explaining the concept and how to cook them. 

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new! I was approached in Fry's parking lot by the owners (I believe) and given a free pizza coupon, so I decided to use it! Very clean place, like if said it's brand new. The two guys working we're super nice and seemed enthusiastic about the place. We got a thin crust cheese pizza and it's in the oven now. I won't update my review on the pizza, because it's Papa Murphy's :) yummy"}
{"text":"Great prices, lots of coupons available. Fresh tasty options."}
{"text":"This particular Papa Murphy's has always strived for excellence. They are willing to go above and beyond to favor our particularities. We always make special requests that are kindly accepted and that are above our expectations. I highly suggest this Papa Murphy's to anyone who wants a quality meal that puts smiles on everyone's face."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas online. My pick up time was 9:00pm. I literally get there at 9:03. The open sign was on, employees inside. I opened the door and said I have an order pick up at 9:00. The girl yells across and says \"sorry, we already closed out the register\"! AFTER THREE MINUTES!!! Knowing you have a customer on the way! I was in the parking lot trying to get to you! When one orders online your required to include phone number and email. I did not receive a call or email. No, I am sorry. Poor business practice."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza and I love this location. Every time I've been here the employees go out of their way to help me with my order, prepare it and get it out quickly. I always get thin crust,cook it on the bottom shelf of the oven at 425 for 10 minutes then take it off the plate put it directly on the shelf and cook it for three more minutes and it is perfect."}
{"text":"Pizza was very large. Got veggie and stuffed crust. The garlic topping is amazing. Def will order again. They cooked nicely in the oven and priced OK, kinda a high price but it was soo good."}
{"text":"New to the area so I had no idea this place only sells frozen pizzas. 

The good: It's convenient because you hand over your money and immediately get the pizza pie of your choice without any delay. Just preheat the oven, peel off the plastic wrapper (no boxes) and pop it in the oven (they have some sort of disposable paper tray especially designed to go straight into the oven)

The bad: The pizzas taste like any you can get from the frozen aisle at the supermarket and the ingredients didn't really taste fresh. Can't see much value in this ... maybe they are healthier than the processed options in supermarket stores? I would also bake my pizzas a little longer than indicated on the instructions sheet that came with my pizzas."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good service with every Papa Murphys I've been too, but I'm really impressed with the staff at this location. They are very courteous on the phone and don't seem to mind answering all of my silly questions I might have. Plus even when they are busy I've rarely been put on hold. They always get the order right. They put the pizzas together quick while still making them perfectly with the right amount of ingredients spread out evenly. Maybe that seems like a strange thing to be impressed with but so many businesses forget the small things. The fresh ingredients. The friendly efficient staff. Plus the military discount. It's all around awesome!"}
{"text":"Awhile back we purchased the special pizza for that day. The person at the register could not get the credit card machine to work, we offered to pay cash instead she said she could not complete the transaction because of the credit card machine issue. We left and ran a couple errands when we returned the issue had been resolved, and that pizza was fantastic. We decided to again try the daily special last night which was the large pepperoni, that was not good at all. Honestly We have had better frozen pizza. We won't be ordering pizza here again."}
{"text":"We love this papa Murphy's! It's very clean and the employee... Joe? We think his name is Joe... Well he's the tall nice one, anyways, he is awesome and friendly and we only like to get pizza when he's there! And it's super close too!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the staff member who was working all alone today, busting out pizzas super fast and with a smile. 

He also carried the pizzas to my car ( which was parked right in front of the store) since I was carrying an infant in a carrier. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fine I guess but shouldn't it be cheaper than cooked carryout pizza?"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I visited a Papa Murphy's.  My visit last evening was for their $12 special, a 5 meat stuffed large pizza. The finished pizza was wrapped up with baking instructions included and carried to the front door.  At home the pizza was cooked according to instructions provided.  The sauce, what little there was, tasted sweeter than I remember.  It was very doughy and dry, especially around the outer 2 to 3 inches. Not quite sure what changed but we've been eating their pizza's for years and found this particular pizza to be very disappointing. We will probably give them another try, but it won't be for a \"stuffed\" pizza."}
{"text":"If you suffer from a gluten allergy (Celiac) and crave wonderful pizza, this is the place to go!  They offer Udi's pizza dough (medium size only) for those who either don't want a gluten product or suffer from a food allergy.  They took all the necessary steps from fresh glove changes,  used fresh sauce (no previous spatulas used on traditional pizza's had been in there), fresh untouched ingredients all the way down the line.  One person made both of our pizzas and there was no \"cross contamination\".  Not sure about the \"white sauce\" you would have to check the ingredients, but the traditional \"red sauce\" is gluten free.  We couldn't wait to get home and start baking.  They were delicious!!!!  Thank you again staff at Papa Murphy's 175 N. Stephanie!  Your gracious attitudes and willingness to help did not go unnoticed!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent and very fast... I thoughts the service was really good and the value was ok as well.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is great BUT their cookie dough is the bomb.com! If I'm craving sweets I'll come here just for cookie dough (even though you're not supposed to eat it raw I still do) cooked or raw it's greeeeaat!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in a papa Murphy's since I was a kid up in Oregon. I decided to give it a try. Tuesday's pizzas are $10 or $13 for a 16 inch. You van build up to 5 toppings of choice or a signature pizza. Pizza has so many toppings. Impressive - nice to see they still don't skimp on toppings. 
Desserts are &5 or two for $8.  I am shameful.  I had the egg free cookie dough in my mouth before the transaction was complete. Probably don't need the pizza anymore. Bonus is I bake it. So I can freeze 1/2 for a future midnight snack attack.  
I'm a hooked now."}
{"text":"I had never tried PM until this store opened. First time, I stick to a basic Canadian-style bacon; cooked it myself with just the right crusty edges. I was impressed and intrigued. Two weeks ago The Beau brings home two Mediterranean Chicken pizzas with added mushrooms, onions and olives.  We scarfed those down pronto during binge watching \"The Killing\" on Netflix. The pizza was absolutely delicious. Last night, we got another one and scarfed it, too.  Papa Murphy's is now my pizza joint for take home goodness. Oh, and catch \"The Killing\" on Netflix. Positively addictive TV."}
{"text":"Seriously...you cannot beat the $10 Tuesdays!  Large pizzas packed with delicious ingredients!  The other night we paid just a tad bit more and got the Garden Veggie + chicken + jalapenos + bacon.  Awesome.  I do like cooking my own pizza.  Delivered is often just warm  once it arrives.  And I really do think Papa Murphy's are generally more generous with the amount of toppings than the larger standard pizza places: Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's.  Frequent coupons often makes it an even better value."}
{"text":"Weve tried their pizza several times and have never been happy with it no matter what kind we buy. The crust around the outside was overdone while the most of the rest was doughy. We actually threw this one away. It was awful. I give up on them."}
{"text":"Love this location and my kids LOVE their GF pizza. While they are not a CGF establishment- there have never been any CC issues."}
{"text":"Called in a order for a half and half told the man my wife would be there in 45 minutes to pick it up. My wife gets there the lady tells my wife no order was there. Turns out they have new employees and they did not know how to make a half and half so my wife was upset and left. I called the lady she told me about the new employees issue and there was no order. I gave them my phone number twice they could have called me. Never had this issue anywhere else. Maybe train your employees before hand."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's pizza is a really good pizza, it's great that you can take it home and cook it perfectly to your liking.
This location has the most helpful people I have dealt with in quite a long time. It is nice to have owners who really enjoy what they are doing and it is clear they enjoy what they are doing here. If you don't see something on the menu just ask and they will do what they can to accommodate. If you are looking for a great pizza and the friendliest people around  you must go to Papa Murphy's at 67 N. Dobson, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"No customer service from any of the adult men on shift at 6:15pm on 4/8/17. Visited this location, have never had Papa Murphys before. 
The young woman greeted me and was very friendly and helpful. She asked if I had been there before and I said no. I told her I would like the $7 pizza and she directed me to pick it up at the cashiering area.
There were 3 men huddled around the register, none of them acknowledged me for about 5 minutes. I can guess there was an issue with their register or a pick up order. They did not talk to me or ask what I needed the whole time I stood there as the only customer in the store. I would have gladly paid cash plus tip or anything to expedite the process. 
The young woman mouthed \"I'm sorry\" to me after I stood there about 3 minutes in silence. It is not her fault as she was doing her job at the pizza bar and managing phone calls while the men ignored the phone ringing.
I am genuinely disappointed in the older men on staff. As a man, speak up if there is an issue and handle the situation. Or at least acknowledge your customers. Blatantly ignoring someone is so disrespectful and infuriating. I walked out of the store after a couple more minutes with no assistance."}
{"text":"Service here is always quick and the staff are very friendly!  Their five dollar pizzas beat Little Ceasers any day!!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife decided to try it out for the first time after exhausting all our options for dinner. Story of my life.....anyways we got there kinda late; About 20 mins before closing. I know when I did customer service back in the day I hated customers who came in right before closing, but they were friendly and very helpful since we were first timers. They explained how it worked and our options. We got home and in a matter of 13 mins at 425 degrees plus an additional 10 mins for our cheese bread it was worth it. Something about baking it yourself you feel for appreciative about dinner then simply ordering and eating. Only reason I give 4 stars not 5 is cause I wasn't crazy about the original red sauce I think I'll try a different sauce next time. Seemed a bit \"blah\" for sauce. Also I kinda hate cutting pizza I think you need a degree in cutting pizza cause my cheese always get a bit shifty when cutting and turns out kinda ugly."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot."}
{"text":"I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a \"Heart Shaped Pizza\" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added \"Cheesy Bread\" and \"Cookie Dough\" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Some of the staff don't always seem like the brightest crayon in the box but the quality and price isn't bad. Love the cookie dough it is a must!"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's has been my favorite for years now. I really wish there were more around because I'll gladly pay for a pizza to bake than ordering from a dominos or whatever. 

Papa Murphy's is freshly made, NOT FROZEN, and always consistent. 

This has been my go to location for a few months now, it's a 20 minutes drive but it's always worth it because it's better than any of their \"competitors\" here in town."}
{"text":"Was skeptical about take-and-bake, but it was awesome. Didn't even need my own pan, it comes right on its own. Great. Will be back."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy pizza would be the best pizza store me and my family would go. Thuy have lots of styles and tipes of pizzas to try out Thy even have lots of other stuff. This store had been the nicest place I've have bee, Thy have the coolest sign spinner outside for this store and I've  been greeted with warm welcome, lots of friendly employees to talk to while I waited for my pizza and was out with extra time to spare in my day. I would most definitely invite my friends and there family to this place I would definitely recommend that this papa merphys is the best"}
{"text":"The 5 meat stuffed pizza is redonkulous.  The deLites are pretty tasty for a \"less filling\" choice."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! My husband and walked in and ordered a cheesless pizza with artichoke onion tomato and garlic. It was absolutely amazing and only took them 5 minutes to make the pizza . Please try this plisse out!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not a big fan of the take it home and bake it idea. I'd honestly rather have the pizza delivered to me already cooked and ready for me to eat. Yeah call me lazy but that's the way I like my pizza but I decided to give this place a try.  

The service was excellent. The girls were super friendly, informative and attentive. I love the fridge full of their specials too. They have some good deals in there.  The food, however, was just okay. 

First we got the salad. Nothing special. Just a salad and the lettuce was a little old. So on to the pizza. I didn't care for the pizza either. Their sauce just lacks substance. Something was just missing. Plus their crust was just okay. I would say it's equivalent to a Digiorno pizza but I guess just fresher ingredients. 

Not a big fan. Great service but just okay food."}
{"text":"Always top notch service ! Right when you walk in you're always greeted by a worker with a smile on their face. They've never gotten my order wrong & they make you a fresh salad if yours isn't available ! Can't complain"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great staff I recommend this place to anyone who likes take an bake pizza, and the staff is friendly and they even walk you out to the door. Amazing place"}
{"text":"They advertise $3.14 pizza but this store doesn't honor it . They will never again get my business HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Thomas is the best. He's great to talk to, extremely helpful and really seems to love his job. However, so far, everyone that's helped me has been as awesome as the last.
Filling out the survey with each pizza gives you great deals for the next visit, including FREE cheese bread.
My only suggestion for veggie-heavy pizzas is to broil the top after baking completely to make sure it doesn't get watery from all the fresh vegetables sweating out their liquids. READ THE DIRECTIONS THOROUGHLY. Stab the pizza multiple times while on a solid surface to make sure 1) no bubbles misplace any beautiful toppings and 2) you won't stab through the cardboard, leaking grease all over your oven.

Favorites:
Gourmet vegetarian with the olive oil and garlic sauce instead of the creamy and the veggie pizza with half red sauce, half creamy garlic.
Large signature pizzas are $13 (I believe) and the family size is $2 more."}
{"text":"The new gluten free crust is terrible . They changed brands and it's like a tough cracker. Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has some really good pizzas and on Tuesdays 10 dollar pizzas.It is worth it the pizzas are way better and are fresh.The staff is really good and super friendly and fun.I highly recommended that you go!! This location needs to have a large sign facing rainbow stating the specials they have!! Busy street and it will help get people in"}
{"text":"Nice spot that just opened. Super friendly staff and tasty food! They have really yummy desserts too."}
{"text":"Friday night is pizza night for my family and I always dread it. I'm not a fast food pizza fan. Not interested in the normal chain places. My friend told me try this place you may be happy with it. She was more than right. We had a build your own pan and a pan cowboy pizza. When I came home with it my husband wasn't happy that I had to cook It. So he complained until I got it out of the oven and on his plate. Our dinner table was silent. My husband looked at me and said yeah it's fine. My kids said Mom it is so good. Later that night my husband said ok ok it was really great, I didn't want tell you since I made a big deal about you cooking it.  He also said the same thing I was thinking. It was so fresh! The taste was really different and I was so happy to like pizza again. My kids are happy because they know I hate pizza night. But not anymore."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a Papa Murphy's in our neighborhood, and this one is top notch!  Family owned and operated franchise, I spent some time talking with the owner while waiting for our pizza to be made. He was super friendly, and so were his children and other employees.

The pizza itself definitely did not disappoint! Thank god I no longer have to rely on Pizza Hut or Little Caesar's for a cheap meal.  Papa Murphy's is the best of both worlds - cost effective and yummy!  This location proves that!"}
{"text":"Only my second time (first time was from the Summerlin location) and I'm IN LOVE with their pizza! it's worth it to not buy delivery and just bake your own pie, and tends to be cheaper. I was a little scared that I'd need a pizza tray to cook it right at home -- you actually cook the pizzas on the tray given, and if you follow the directions it will come out perfect each time! I've had their pan crust and thin crust; both are delicious! their salads are fresh, and their cinnamon wheels are sooo good. comes with real cream cheese frosting, which I enjoy :) 

the employees were very friendly as well. I will definitely come back whenever I'm in the mood for a good pizza. move over, papa john's :)"}
{"text":"Nice place. Very clean, they make the pizza right in front of you. The regular pricing is reasonable. Great location in Old Farm Shoppes and parking is always available. This is a quality place that is run right.
It's not as good as Papa Del's but Papa Del's takes 90 minutes or longer to deliver a pizza that has often cooled or slid into a lump of cheese by the time the delivery boy finished smoking the doobie on the way to your house.
So with Papa Murphy's it's no tip, hot out of your own oven, and Dow Chemical is happy because each pizza uses two square yards of Saran Wrap."}
{"text":"Their pizza is really good. I usually get the stuffed chicken bacon ranch but other ones are good too including the garlic chicken! Their s'mores dessert pizza is amazing. I also almost always get their cookie dough and end up eating most of it myself raw. Definitely call your order in ahead because if you don't you could be waiting a bit. Also there's always coupons out there, so don't forget those!"}
{"text":"I kinda feel sorry for the people who go to the Joyful Yoga studio next door... They have to resist delicious pizza thoughts everytime they are meditating! LoL

This Papa Murphy's Pizza is consistently good, offering delicious pizza and really friendly service.  Enough said.

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, excellent customer service! The staff at this location goes a extra step with the customers! Excellent, pizza, especially the Chicago Stuffed Pizza and the salads are to die for! They have a new customer here!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. I like coming here for game nights at the house because you get to cook the pizza in the oven and have it come out fresh and hot and eat right away while you are watching the game. Fast array of toppings and options. Look for coupons when you come here because they tend to have a lot of offers out there. Decently priced."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza. The staff is amazing and super helpful. I only get pizza here! I look forward to it when I travel to Charlotte"}
{"text":"I just left this location. I remember ordering Papa Murphy's as a kid with my parents and I haven't lived near one in quite some time. I recently moved to the area and was nearly too excited about seeing it. This was the best restaurant experience that I've had in a while. Davar, I'm so sorry if I've butchered your name, is an incredible representation of your restaurant. He was absolutely kind, funny, and a true delight. He managed to up-sell me on my pizzas without being pushy, he was right, I'm starving and needed bigger pizzas. He made my pizzas quickly and they look beautiful. I'm really glad that I came in and I'm extra glad that you have Davar on staff. I'll be back probably too often!"}
{"text":"We visit here so often we have our own name tags. Jk but seriously, the price is right and ooooooweeeeeeee it's good! Try the pan pizza!"}
{"text":"Called a total of 6 times and get hung up on 5 of those times. Whoever hired the phone guy may wanna try n do a little QA on this. Its the face of your company and very off putting when papa Murphy's brand is otherwise GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Got a flyer in the mail so I stopped in to check it out. Only been open for about a week, but they seemed to be running well. I'm more of a \"boutique\" pizza guy (Federal, il Bosco, Parlor), but Papa Murphy's is a great alternative for very good, quick, easy & affordable pizza nights. Picked up a large, thin crust pie with bacon (of course). They assemble it fresh, while you wait (about 5 minutes). I paid $7 with a coupon. Came with its own baking tray. Pop it in the oven for 12 minutes and you're good to go. Beats the poop out of the delivery chain pizzas -- uber-cheesy and tasty. Probably would have been even better if we owned a pizza stone. Hmmm... Owner seemed like a really good guy. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Nothing better than the homemade feeling of making your own pizza!"}
{"text":"Well we did like them. They disappeared and are now closed. With no warning.  Would love to know what happened."}
{"text":"Super clean! Friendly staff! Great pizza! I have been in 2 times since they opened, and every time they make  an amazing pizza for a great price :) my kids looove it!!"}
{"text":"Great place, very clean and super friendly staff! Pizza is made fresh to order than you bring it home to cook it right out of your oven. Pizza isn't greasy like most take out.

I enjoyed chatting with the owner about my home town, the corporate office of Papa Murphy's (Vancouver, WA.) and I love how they give back to the community."}
{"text":"I am so glad they opened close to me. they are so good and nice to have a good hot pizza. all the ingredients are fresh and lots of cheese. I now have a great new place for pizza. and they are so  nice and fast. thank you guys keep it up"}
{"text":"Best pie, EVER!  Great value as well.  You can get a large pie for $13, including tax.  On Tuesday's you can get same for $10.  Plenty of fresh ingredients and a friendly staff to boot.  They have spoiled me for all other pizza stores."}
{"text":"I love the pizza from Papa Murphy's but I would not go to this location at all. The poor worker was doing her best to get the pizzas made while people continued to come in. She was forced to work alone while a manager sat in the office  as she did have to run back there to get approval on something so there was someone back there. That person did not come put to help at all. This location is very badly ran and I would highly recommend using the locations on Decatur or Durango and completely pass by this one. No stars at all for this place tried to give no stars but app would not let me"}
{"text":"OK, pizza eaters, lets review things for the test. Papa Murphy's is a national franchise wherein 95% of the free world (Al S.) know this is a take and bake company.

All of the pizza's in this franchise have the exact same ingredients. It is called duplication.

Maybe there are some franchise locations owned by people who lack customer service and business skills, but not this location. I have been driving there twice a month from North Summerlin since they opened and I can assure you they run a tight ship (K.A)

I love this location and would not place a lot of credibility on reviewers with just a few posts or people looking for a free lunch.

And Krista, the star rating system is about consumer experience and not whether Wolfgang Puck owns the place. You seem to love the place...3 stars?"}
{"text":"Always a fan. There is only one store in Henderson which is kind of out of the way for me. It was easier to stop off at this location 5 minutes off I-15. Great staff and next door to Lee's."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbor and decided to order a pizza and salad, online, with a half price coupon! 

The pizza was TOTALLY worth it! I ordered the Thai Chicken pizza with thin crust, and Pineapple as an add on, thanks to a recommendation from a friend; and it did not disappoint! The order was correct and on time! 

My only recommendation is to eat this pizza the next day, as it was even better cold! I topped it with some Sriracha and was in HEAVEN! 

The Garden Salad however, I do not recommend... I just didn't taste good, and the ranch was bland. However the staff did bag it up nice for me, which was sweet!

Overall, I'd come back and get the same pizza again if I were in the neighborhood, or at another Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"Again, awesomely fast and friendly service.

Sign up for those weekly text messages!!!

Received a text today: $4.25 for a large pepperoni pizza (maximum purchase of three). What a deal!"}
{"text":"A great take-n-bake pizza at a reasonable price. Especially, on $10 Tuesdays. However, I can't give it 5 Stars because my orders are messed up quite often (luckily, it's nothing too serious and quickly resolved, as I usually catch the mistake before I leave).

I've tried several of their pizzas and I have found 'em all to be very good to excellent. And, this is the ONLY Pizza place that I have been to where I don't need to order extra Pepperoni, as Papa's puts 'em on edge to edge."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good IF they don't screw up your order. And don't ask for it to be fixed. They act like they bought the supplies themselves and by fixing the mistake they made they were out their own money. They should learn to not make mistakes to start with and it would save them plenty of money."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I always thought that it was a dumb idea, who would want to buy a pizza uncooked?  Well long story short I was talked into it by some friends and I can report that the pizza is delicious.  I will certainly return!"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza the other day but didn't feel like buying all the ingredients to make one myself. Enter Papa Murphy's. This is near my office, so I stopped by on my way home and picked up a pie. 

This isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but I will say it beats DIY with a store-bought crust, Digiorno (or another frozen 'za) or Papa John's in my book. 

For about the same price as a frozen pizza or the harris teeter take & bake, you get a take & bake made with fresh ingredients right in front of you. I tried the Herb Chicken Mediterranean delite - packed with spinach, sundried tomatoes, chicken, cheese & herbs. The crust was really what made it for me, so crispy-crunchy out of the oven. 

I thought it was really good and most convenient, even my husband was salivating when he got home & smelled it! I will definitely pick one up next time I'm craving some yummy pizza at home."}
{"text":"Had some last minute dinner guests, ran over to my nearest papa Murphy's and grabbed 3 large pizzas for $30 ($10 Tuesday).  They made them so fast in front of me, we just baked them and they are perfect.
The toppings are generous."}
{"text":"It's rare that we go any other place for pizza. We enjoy pizza from here because the ingedients is fresh and yes the down side of it is you take it home and bake it yourself. But the upside of it is that it will be hot and fresh out of the oven onto the table immediately. The taste is what always brings us back and the prices aren't that bad either. The taste, service and prices you can't lose."}
{"text":"Yummy garlic sauce for any pizza. Bought the gourmet italian and chicken with bacon. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"HORRENDOUS customer service. Kristi was rude from the moment I walked in the door. I used to eat Papa Murphys weekly...after today I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is a franchise business, which means (in theory) you should be getting a consistent product but management will vary.

This particular Papa Murphy's delivers what you would expect in food quality. All of the pizzas that I have gotten from here have been better than what you would get from the freezer section of the grocery store but not quite up there with your favorite local pizza joint. They're cheap and great when you're in a pinch for a quick dinner.

This location is brand new, the building just finished construction about a month ago. It is quite clear that the employees are not the most experienced. In my two visits so far service has been incredibly slow and the employees do not seem to understand yet what they are doing. They just need more time but for now it's frustrating to watch someone fumble around in food prep and at the computer.

Please note that this location currently does not accept online ordering or coupons. I suspect this will change as they get more established in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love take and bake pizza, and nobody does it better than Papa Murphy's.  You can get any number of their specials or design your own. And, what makes it better is you get a better pizza with better ingredients at a much better price than the carry out or delivery varieties that over charge and under deliver.

Seriously, going to Papa Murphy's is like going to a Subway sandwich shop.  All the ingrediants are clearly displayed and fresh as can be. Whereas, the other pizza places have lots of great frozen mass market ingrediants that look like they have seen better days before spending oh so much time in a freezer.

Papa Murphy's also has fresh salads and homemade take and bake cheese bread which rocks! And don't get me started on the chocolate chip cookie dough.  So Ono!

While the team at this location is awesome, I suggest ordering online. It's easier to make the hard choices and, get this, you can select the exact minute you plan to pick it up.  It's like setting the cockpot early in the morning and coming home to goodness.

Another thing is they have great online specials and big discounts for online orders.

Mucho Kudos!"}
{"text":"We ordered the barbecue pizza tonight. It tasted fantastic!! The young men working there are always friendly and professional.  It's also a very well kept business. We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Papa Murphy's for about 6 months now. To me, this beats most of those \"delivery joints\" hands down. Think of it as a sandwich shop for Pizza: they have per-configured pies that are made fresh to order, or you can create your own with your favorite ingredients. Either way, it is put together right in front of you. Take it home, remove plastic wrap, pop it in the oven and enjoy! It even comes with its own tray so you don't have to bake directly on the oven rack. 

We always find the toppings to be fresh, and more than abundant. Our favorite is the Chicken Bacon Artichoke (we sub out olives for the bacon) , and a large feeds the 2 of us, plus yields leftovers. For 10 bucks, you can't beat this. 

Coupons are readily available in the weekly flyers, and are also on their website. They also have a rewards program. 

We find the management/employees at this location to be very polite and provide excellent service. You can do call ahead, but we have never found it busy at this location."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Papa Murphy's and it was a little weird.

First, the experience.  This was the weird part and the reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars (otherwise it would have likely been 4).  I walked into the store about noon on a Sunday.  There was no one else in there.  And by no one else, I mean no other customers - AND, no employees.  I stood there in the lobby for about 3 minutes.  You can't really see into the kitchen area, but there was no noise coming from there and I didn't see any activity.  I jingled my keys a couple of times to see if anyone would hear me.  Nothing.  In the meantime, the cash registers are sitting right there, the tip jar with several $1 bills in it is sitting right there - totally unattended.

Finally after about 3 minutes I yelled \"hello!  Is anyone here?!\"  A couple of seconds after that, out come this young guy and young girl (they looked like maybe high school age).  Neither of them greeted me.  Neither of them apologized.  The guy simply took his position at the register and asked if I knew what I wanted.  I felt like I was on Candid Camera or something.  I placed my order, the guy took my money and immediately disappeared back into the kitchen without even a \"thank you\". And the girl  started making my pizza.  She didn't speak to me even once - even though I was standing right in front of her watching her - and the only other person in the place.  She finishes, wraps up my pizza, hands it to me and says \"here you go.  Have a nice weekend\".   Sooooo bizarre.

Anyway, my expectations for the pizza were not high.  However, after getting it home and baking it, it turned out quite good.  I got the Cowboy which is pepperoni, sausage,  mushrooms and black olives.  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste, texture and freshness of the ingredients.  And the price is right - $10 (with the coupon) for a large - and they do not skimp on the toppings at all.  Very full, dense, pizza.

I will definitely get another one - just not at that particular store.  There is another one about the same distance away from me and I'll just try that place next time."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After my review we were contacted by the district manager. He shared with us this location has gone through some recent changes. Our most recent pizza had the thin crust and topping amounts we were accustomed to seeing with Papa Murphy's pizza. We look forward to seeing the same  consistent pizzas in the future."}
{"text":"We came in here yesterday and reviewed wonderful service. The young lady who was the cashier was very sweet and friendly and the young man brought our pizzas to the car for us and overall gave us great customer service. Will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Papa Murphy's to pickup a yummy pizza to have a dinner at home! 
We quickly ordered and they made our fresh pizza and wrapped it up for us to take home and bake! You can customize however you like. We don't like tomato sauce so they did olive oil instead! Awesome!
They treated us like family and that was awesome! Even when my curious 2 year old accidentally knocked a two liter bottle of Sierra mist and it busted all over the floor...Mike made light of it and let my little man pretend to \"help\" clean up! 
Our pizza was hands down the best that I have had. The freshness is the crust was amazing! You have instructions on how to bake at home...we followed those to get the perfectly baked delicious pizza in less than 15 minutes in your own oven!
The prices are great too! Quality ingredients at an amazing price with friendly staff...you can't ask for more!
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So much for $10 Tuesday. We ordered two large pizzas and was charged $8 more than advertised. The manager has a really bad attitude and was arguing with me. It was very confusing when I asked for my refund for the over charging. I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"My boys love the stuffed crust Chicago pizza. .I love it because it feeds there friends 2..:)"}
{"text":"First off, I would like to say how impressed I was with the customer service. I will be a repeat customer in the future. Got the coupons in the mail and thought that I would give this place a try. Walked through the door and was immediately greeted with a smile. The inside is set up nicely. Modern decor with a great flow. By the door is a display case with pre made pizzas, various cookie doughs, cheesy bread, and sodas. Then on to the counter where if you don't know what you want, the staff is eagerly waiting to help with suggestions. I got the spicy fennel sausage artisan thin crust pizza. Fresh ingredients, vibrant colors, and great taste made this pizza a hit for me. I like the thought of having to bake my own pizza. Get a pizza in the morning and then put it into your fridge for future use. The timing of cooking the pizza is up to you. The bake it yourself cookies is a perfect compliment to the pizza. A variety of flavors to choose from!"}
{"text":"Always delighted to spend my money here. The food is always delicious at a very fair price, but what keeps me coming back is the customer service.  I have never received such wonderful customer service in a fast food type establishment. I always feel welcomed when I arrive and truly feel cherished as a customer. My hat goes off to you Papa Murphys for consistently providing an above and beyond experience. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We love coming here because of the convenience, great pizza and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"We get pizza here pretty often. One of us will pick it up and the other will preheat the oven. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always tasty."}
{"text":"I had never been here before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was a little confused when I found out I had to take it home and bake it but I decided to give it a try. The staff was very helpful and explained everything including cooking directions. This place makes some good pizzas! The crust on the pan pizza is wayyyyy too good.  I ate much more than I intended but hey.... why not. I will def be back."}
{"text":"This is our regular Papa Murphys pizza location the staff is fantastic and the pizza is always fresh and delicious great for a quick and easy lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Our family has been ordering from this Papa Murphy's since they opened this location. We usually order the same thing. They recently discontinued one of our favorites. We decided to try a different pizza that we had a coupon for. At time of pick up, the cashier took about 5 minuets to enter coupon while the rest of the staff including the manager sat in back and talked while they saw him struggling. Then he wouldn't honor coupon. Called manager and still insisted they wouldn't offer coupon. Said they had new management. So I decided to just purchase 1 of the pizzas I ordered since they wouldn't honor coupon. I told the manager it's unfortunate they won't honor it and now lose out on a already made pizza. Cashier said it's ok, 1 pizza isn't going to hurt us, we don't need the business that bad. I'd like to mention that I was the only one in the store and no other pizzas were made for other customers. I told the cashier and manager that I didn't like their comments and wasn't going to buy any of the pizzas...... they said bye as they laughed at me. It's ashamed what customer service has come to. With so many other pizza companies around you'd think they would  give the best service they can from a not so popular pizza joint. We will not be ordering from papa Murphy's any longer and will discourage people from ordering from them."}
{"text":"Love their Thai Chicken pizza and their Chicken Bacon Artichoke. Very affordable. Deliciously fresh.

Also great weeknight specials."}
{"text":"So, I first discovered Papa Murphy's while visiting the in-laws in WI.  What a cool idea to get a yummy pizza and bring it home to cook.  It's about the same cost as a Pizza Hut pizza, but you don't have to eat it immediately!  It's great to throw in the fridge and bake later.  

When I noticed Papa Murphy's off of Stephanie, I was excited to give it a try again.  We have not been disappointed.  We have been there at least three times.  Besides tasty pizza that is big and packed with toppings, I really like the salads.  They make up everything fresh when you order it.  

Thumbs up and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to avoid this place like the plague.. A while back, I ordered cheesesticks, and the lovey got a meat filled pizza (I'm vegetarian). Those were the nastiest cheesesticks I've ever tasted. Straight up like chemicals had been sprayed all over it.
HOWEVER, the beloved swears by it, and when he told me has was going tonight, I decided to give them another try.. And I'm so glad I did!! I ordered the vegetable (vegetarian) pizza. I ordered pan-style crust, and on the menu it comes with cheese, mushroom, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and artichoke hearts, with a substitution of creamy garlic sauce, instead of traditional red pizza sauce. I ordered it without artichoke, and added black olives and feta cheese. 
Sooooo good!! They have a special on Tuesdays (today) that most large pizzas are 10 dollars. The bread/crust tasted so fresh, and they did not skimp on the toppings!! The best part was the creamy garlic sauce. I LOVE garlic and this had perfect flavor! And only took about 12 minutes to cook at home. I swore this place off, but I will be becoming a regular customer."}
{"text":"We usually order a family size stuffed Chicago and a delite Mediterranean chicken.   The pizza is great and I can feed the whole family for less than $30 and have lots of leftovers.  Make sure to call ahead to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Very bad store and pathetic customer service

Was here in Friday night -- 11-25-2016

They don't take any of their site coupons and also no clear info on what available in store during order



D"}
{"text":"If you don't mind bringing it home to cook, this is the place. Freshly made when you order -- their sauce is terrific and the ingredients super fresh. It doesn't take long to prepare if you didn't call ahead. They now have a foil pan for the large and a modified recipe for preparing your pizza on the BBQ. Perfect for Vegas summers. They've also added an even thinner, thin crust pizza called the Delight. This is the first Papa Murphy's I've seen with a drive-thru. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is a pizza place with a unique concept.  They sell you an uncooked pizza that's assembled right before your eyes.  You then take it home and bake it according to the given directions.   We went there one evening and got a pizza with Canadian bacon.

Papa Murphy's also sells raw chocolate chip cookie dough.  Again, it comes with directions.  Soda comes in 20 oz. bottles and only Pepsi products.  Hint:  If you like Coke products, just go next door and get your soda at the Subway Sandwich shop!

The pizza directions are pretty straightforward.  However, we found it strange that the instructions said to puncture any bubbles that appear while the pizza is baking.  A pizza crust without bubbles?  How strange!  Needless to say, we ignored that instruction!

The chocolate chip cookie dough also comes with straightforward instructions.

So...how did this all turn out?  The pizza was unremarkable---no better than a store bought fresh pizza---and that was disappointing.  Somehow, with such a unique concept, we were expecting better.  As far as the cookies go---what was odd was that they gave off no smell when baking.  When you make homemade cookies, they tend to give off a tempting aroma that has you waiting impatiently for them to be done.  So...the cookies were ok.  However, we've had better.

If you do get one of their pizzas, get it knowing that it won't be any better than what you would get at the supermarket.  However, the one advantage that Papa Murphy's has that the supermarket doesn't---you can customize  your toppings.

Otherwise, the staff was friendly and efficient.  When making our pizza, they made it incorrectly but quickly spotted their mistake and made us the pizza we ordered."}
{"text":"We've had this a few times, service has been spotty but OK, pizza was pretty good.   Tried to order a thin one tonight, they had a special.  Problem was they ran out of thin crust so there was no pizza for me.  I'd think this could have been solved one of 5 ways:    

5-Offer a coupon for a pizza at a later date with no charge.
4-Offer a pizza using a different crust at the same price.
3-Don't allow online orders when you know you are out of a specific topping or crust.
2-Send email or make phone call informing customer of lack of crust and sorry they don't have tonight.
1-Allow customer (s) (I wasn't the only one) to come in and find out there is no pizza available for them after driving to the store and waiting in line to be told no pizza for you. 

Since they went with one, I'm going with one as well as in one-star-won't be back in the near future if ever."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!

My order:
Gluten free crust
Garlic and olive oil instead or red sauce
Artichoke hearts
Mushrooms
Tomatoes
(and of course the mozzarella cheese)

I cook it for 12 minutes at 425 degrees and it's perfect.

This is my favorite pizza of all time and I could eat it everyday. Even my boyfriend who doesn't have to eat gluten free loves this pizza. The staff is really nice and quick. My only gripe is 3 out of 4 times, the same pizza cost me $13.50 and one time it cost $17.50. I didn't say anything because it was only my second time here and I figured someone must have cut me a deal for $13.50 on my first visit. But subsequent visits proved my creation should cost $13.50. I think that's a pretty good price for a weeknight dinner for 2!"}
{"text":"I Love this place!!!!!!  Papa Roni with extra sauce"}
{"text":"Weird idea but the product itself is pretty good and priced right.  Worth a try.  There really are advantages to take-and-bake. It's ready when you want, you can slice it anyway you please, and theoretically you could bake half today and the other half tomorrow.  Look for their coupons or specials and try it yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! The best cookie dough on the planet! Thanks girls for making my night. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Never enough staff!  Called pizza in, they told us 20 min.  We got there 30 min later and they told us 20 more min.  Pizza's laying everywhere with only 2 workers on a Saturday at 6:00pm .... really??  This happens on weekdays, but thankfully I come at off times.  But they are still overwhelmed if more than 1 person is there.  Not good!  So we headed to Stephanie where they had our pizza made in the time it took us to get there!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen take your seats for what is going to be one of the most accurate reviews of your lives. Let me start off this review by saying this pizza is the pizza for you and me. It is bomb af. Today me and my boy were driving by this establishment on our way to Walmart. We thought hey, we could go for some pizza. So we popped on in to this place and ordered up a quick large pizza. Although we were surprised when she handed us a pizza uncooked. She explained their idea is that they assemble it and you bake it. Ok :/. She did tell us the instructions that were also written on the pizza, which is quality customer service. We took it home and baked the heck out of it. This pizza is very good. However the whole take it bake it thing is kind of odd not gunna lie. For the price they should just bake it. But hey it's good pizza, good ingredients, papa murphys so head on down to pizza town."}
{"text":"Here's a common issue I face: I don't have a lot of dough (pun intended). Okay money. In fact, I budget extensively. And in that budget is room for things like pizza. 

Now, this generally lends to either frozen, store bought pizzas, OR having delivered (or carryout pizzas) which can be pricey.

The dilemma here is this: I love saving money, but a man can only eat so many frozen pizzas. You get what you pay for.

With ordering out, you get stuck with a decent bill; especially if you have a family of teenagers like I do.

The solution? Fresh pizza that you can bake yourself.

Let's get real here for a moment: I don't have time to sit there and make pizzas myself. I just don't. Nor do I like buying the ingredients for something when I'm only going to make it one time.

And don't get me wrong, I don't mind ordering pizza every now and then. I just can't do it all the time.

Papa Murphy's is the answer.

I've been a here few times, and have been satisfied every time. And I'll tell you why:

I like to rate businesses in three areas; the SCHWABE RATING SYSTEM if you will. It is based on three things as listed below:

+ VALUE FOR THE PRICE
+ CUSTOMER SERVICE
+ QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT

Here's how Papa Murphy's stands up.

First, lets tackle CUSTOMER SERVICE. There isn't much to discuss. You're there maybe five, ten minutes. However, the staff at this location were courteous enough and smiled, so good on them. They didn't seem particularly enthused, but not angry or distracted either.

VALUE

Generally, an ordered pizza is anywhere from $5 to $13, I'd say. A large from here is about $10, $12. It varies. But the pizzas are BIG. So, they're not cheap, but you get your money's worth when you pay. They also have desert pizzas which are about $4 (I think it was) which isn't bad for their size either.

Overall, a justified price for their food, and they do have deals and coupons regularly.

QUALITY

Here's where PM shines. They're food is phenomenal. Yes, you have to bake it at home, but you can see all the ingredients they put in. Everything looks and smells good. Fresh. Crisp.

Today, I tried the Mediterranean pizza with spinach, vying for something out of the norm, and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't think to take a picture, but I should have. Delicious.

Even their crust is good, and this is an area that I feel many places mess up.

VERDICT

I give Papa Murphy's a FIVE for the sole fact that they are masters at what they do. For the price, you get quite a bit of food, enough to feed family and friends. And the quality is worth the price too. Something you wont get frozen.

I have gone back before and definitely will again.

- Coty

PS. Their pizzas are great for get-togethers and those 'get home from work and you're like I want something good, but don't want to make anything' kind of nights."}
{"text":"papa murphys on stephanie street is as good as gets.   go see \"steven\" or \"amari\" or \"stephanie\" and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have tried a few different locations of Papa Murphy's, usually out of convenience to wherever I might be at the time. That stopped as the Pizza was good but never as good as this location. Staff is amazing here. They make a good consistent pizza every time I go here. At this point is has become our Tuesday family go to meal a few times a month. As you can't beat the quality of the Pizza for $10.

Also to anyone with a Traeger grill. Use a pizza stone. Put it on high and cook your pizza on your wood fired grill. You may never eat a pizza any other way. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location!
I love the pizza but the owner is not very friendly. :(
Won't take any coupons either!!!!!
I will drive down to the location at Buffalo and Flamingo before I go back to this location."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. It is fresh and delicious! And the price is right. The owner is very nice and helpful. Definitely recommend this Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"Nicest, and most friendly staff I've encountered! Pizza seemed slightly undercooked/doughy but it was still great! I'm not a fan of crispy pizza anyway. Ate two slices on the way home- I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Always friendly and accurate service.  Kat is awesome!  Thanks."}
{"text":"This is a nice way to get some cheap pizza. However, I don't think the pizza is as good as other pizza places in town, and I actually think grocery store frozen pizza beats it. The nice thing is that you can build your own pizza, and they also offer gluten free. They have a s'mores dessert that is to die for, but I usually prefer Papa John's pizza over their joint."}
{"text":"Call ahead or order online to save some time! Use promotion code \"25%off\" for online orders to save some dough! 

Oh, personal favorite - Thin crust Thai Chicken, add pineapple & herb and cheese blend. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Had one in Ca close to the house, and sense  moving here only visited one once in a while now that this place has opened leas then 3 miles from the house Im there often enough you could set up a cot for me in the back and Id be home. Wonderful friendly  service great fresh food reasonable prices what more could you want."}
{"text":"We had great friendly service that was super fast.  Best pizza!  We love this place!  The thin crust is the best!   The staff is very friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the cowboy pizza and the cinnamon wheel ! :)  Yes it is a take and bake place, but the quality is great !  I wish they sell dipping sauce for the pizza . 
Do the survey (on the menu paper that they put inside the pizza) and you can get free items  (ie cinnamon wheel) on your next purchase :)"}
{"text":"So excited to get Papa Murphy's take and bake pizza as a new neighborhood option. We picked  thin-crust pizzas with high-quality , healthy toppings and took the pizzas on  paper baking trays back home for 12-18 min. in the oven & then PIZZA TIME!  (Gluten free available too.)"}
{"text":"Love me some Papa Murphys deep dish family sized pizzas. I usually order when I find a $3 off coupon and this is the pizza I get every year for the superbowl and I usually order 3 of them (one in each flavor). Usually comes out to be about $14 a pie with the coupon which is way worth it because it's absolutely loaded and doubles in height when baked!! All the ingredients are fresh and the combinations are very tasty as well. 10/10 would recommend their stuffed pizzas if you've never had it before. I usually call ahead of time and by the time I drive there the pizza is ready."}
{"text":"Once again, it is a Mystery as to who eats this pizza, it is no better than a frozen pizza, and in many instances worse. Maybe if you have kids that will eat anything, unable to discriminate good food from bad, then maybe this is the place to go. But for anyone with a discriminating taste, this is a bake and throwaway pizza. 

The service is quite good, and the product has all of the corporate fast food elements that you would expect from a pizza fast food delivery location, but the pizza is god awful. When you're done baking it, the pizza tastes like you've put red sauce and vegetables and pepperoni on a giant slice of bread, the crust is dry and completely without flavor. This is not a place to go if you are looking for good food, this is the place to go if you are too lazy to cook for your kids."}
{"text":"Fast, Friendly and Clean. Reasonable prices with great staff. Never an issue and always honor coupons. Food is quality and tastes great every time."}
{"text":"This location is really great. The workers are really nice and they always take my coupons. They are fast too. The thin crust gourmet veggie is my most fav!"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's pizza is delish! I am a fan. I have had pizza a couple of times from this location now and I have been impressed. You order your pizza at the register, they make your pizza (uncooked) while you wait and you take it home to bake. The ingredients look much fresher than other local delivery places and much more affordable as well. There are always coupons in the newspaper or local flyers and you can take a large pizza home for $10, $12 without a coupon. I usually order a create your own original crust with pepperoni, jalapeno and onions but they have many other great custom flavor combos as well. They have three different crust types, thin, original and pan and also a stuffed pizza option. The pizza's are very cheesy and have great flavor and come in there own bakeable tray. It's an easy, delicious and affordable dinner. The customer service is pretty good as well, everyone seems very friendly at the counter. 

I will continue to eat at Papa Murphy's. Great pizza!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Today we ordered 8 salads and a family size pepperoni pizza for our office lunch. The salads were all excellent with everything so fresh. LaLa made our salads/pizza quickly and had us on our way in less than 10 mins. The store was very clean and welcoming. Our office will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Two ladies in there didn't have a very good customer service vibe. I'm usually asked if I want thin or hand tossed crust and I get thin, but I wasn't asked this time. I didn't really think about it until I cut and took a bite of my pizza at home. To me I know Papa Murphy's for their thin crust pizza... then I came home to hand tossed crust! I don't like it like I do the thin crust. So please ask customers what kind of crust they want! If I wanted good hand tossed pizza I would have went to Old School Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's. Their thin crust pizza is delicious. I love that you can create whatever pizza you want with their varied ingredients. It is also inexpensive. It's the best option for pizza in Anthem as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Funny story about this place, let me tell you about my embarrassment... I decided to order pizza for my coworkers and I for lunch, I've never had of this place so I wanted to try it out. We were so hungry oh my gosh and when the food got here we found it was raw and we needed to cook it! We all laughed and had a good time even though we never got to eat the food at work haha. I did take the pizza home it was a large family size meat lovers pizza and cooked it for the next days dinner, the pizza was great."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I heard this place was opening up in my neck of the woods, as I grew up eating it when I lived on the west coast. They carry one of the best gluten free pizzas I've ever had. The owner, Wes, is a great guy and goes out of his way to ensure the service and quality stay top notch."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fresh ingredients. The pizzas cook fast and they're damn tasty if you know what you're in the mood for. 

Pro tip: that garlic chicken pizza plus bacon is amazing."}
{"text":"We order from here 2-3 time a month and we love this place! I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who said it's no better or cheaper than places that deliver. (Ever had Papa John's?) For the price, the pizza is as good as any in town. Sure you can get a pizza that's a little better but you'll pay twice as much. Whoever does the hiring is an absolute ace. We've never had anything but exceptional service. It's mostly high school kids that work there and so far, without exception, the most pleasant young folks you ever want to meet. 

I give them 2 thumbs up and if I happen to grow another hand I'll come back and give them 3!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by the Owner the following day. She was extremely apologetic & expressed her corporate vendor concerns about the quality of lettuce. She asked for pictures to forward in order to get problem resolved. I am happy with outcome & will give this establishment another try.   
Original Post-We have been getting pizza from this place for quite a few years now but not sure we will be back. Tonite we decided to also try their Cobb Salad. What a horrible mistake. Before I took the lid off, it should have been a red flag - the Sell By Date had been changed or written over. The lettuce inside was mostly pink and limp. I thought it was just a couple pieces on top but, as I dug down it only got worse. The turkey meat was even slimy & discolored. The bacon bit pieces were mostly a flesh tone color.  
We are now concerned about the lack of quality ingredients & health precautions taken and  used for their pizzas. 
I called to make sure they remove any remaining salads that were for sale & to report the problem. I never asked to speak to a manager but was immediately told one wouldn't be available for 3-4 days and to call back then. 
There was my answer as to what's going on - This business is being run by minimum wage earning kids and without any supervision. 
Please be careful eating at one of these establishments. Young kids can only do the best they can. Shame on Management for expecting kids to run their business!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza its fortable my personal favorite pizza it is herb chicken Mediterranean with sun dried tomatoes feta cheese spinach garlic sauce and spices it is just so delicious the staff was very helpful very friendly nice very positive I must say this will be my permanent place"}
{"text":"Had a great experience picking up my new neighbor pizza with manager Scott.  Very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat for sure!!! If I was stranded on a desert isle with only one choice for meals to eat....it  would most definitely be pizza.  

The Papa Murphy's concept is a take and bake at home ideal, which drives home the coming together of family and friends  You start by walking into the store and being greeted by friendly employees. They helped me find just the right pizza to feed me and my family, and did a great job up saleling me on the thick and cheesy bread.
 
Your delicious masterpiece goes into being freshly wrapped to be made in an oven at home for an awesomeness pizza.

Any way you build your own it will be AMAZING!!. For just $10 on Tuesdays you can get any pizza any size.  They offer some of their own concoctions so you don't have to do the brain thinking in a high pressure environment because it feels like you are holding up  the line.  Either way Papa Murphy's Pizza is awesome and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but they seriously need to learn how to wash their hands! Young girl working behind the the counter puts on her gloves, to make my pizza, when I show the young gentleman that I have a 50% off coupon for a pizza, she immediately comes over & says \"Wait can I see your phone?\" Like if she didn't believe me, even though the guy had already verified it. Then their phone rings, she answers it, once she's done, she comes back to make our pizza. Mind you, she's wearing the same gloves! I tell her, that she needs to change her gloves, she responds with \"Oh yeah sorry, I always forget\" WTH?!! Really?! Another employee walks in, I'm assuming he's their boss cause he was the only one in a black polo, well guess what...he doesn't believe in hand washing either! Sucks cause the pizza is good, guess it's that little extra ingredient added!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to give them a try.  This absolutely beats delivery.  Baking is super easy.  No need for extra pans; bakes right on the sheet it comes on.  My favorite is the Herb Chicken pizza.  My son loves the Cheesy bread too!"}
{"text":"This is great pizza, specially works for sports get togethers. Always will have out of the oven hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Pizza is what you should expect from Papa Murphy's. Staff is not. Call in to order they sound like they dont want to talk to you or be there. Ordered a pizza wanted a second but they didnt care. Just wanted to know when I would pick it up. Gave them 45 minutes. When I arrived I had to wait an additional 20 minutes and I arrived when I said I would. THe staff just doesnt care."}
{"text":"Love the concept, bake your own pizza to your heart's desire. On the pricey side but they've got coupons that help. Currently getting 2 family sized: one mushroom and one jalapeño. Yum!"}
{"text":"This review is over due but I would want to give Michael rose the recognition he needs. Ever since he left service has been sleepy. With him I have always felt welcome. Please hire more like him. Cashews is a good worker th"}
{"text":"I love this pizza and the staff is soooo friendly. They had my food ready before I arrived and they even took it to my truck! This is my first time here and i will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"I like take and bake. If it's burned it's your fault, if its under done, you did it! Lol they have great pizza that you can order as is or tweak it as Lil. Both chicken pizzas are  amazing! Try the stuffed pizza it's so much food!"}
{"text":"First time going to this location and I can say it was clean, professional staff, and decent prices. I liked the cool idea to take home the pizza and cook it myself, at first I really thought it was like any other pizzeria out here and it is not, it taste allot better when your doing it at home yourself, they may make the pizza for you, but taste it way different.

The staff was helpful and patient, they are clean, use hairnets, gloves, and wash there hands frequently when I was there."}
{"text":"family owned and run high quality food clean and great staff! pizzas are delicious and i just love the fresh quality every time you must must must have this pizza at least once a week! love it!"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Why did you have to open this location so close to my house? Your pizzas are so much better than everyone else's that I can't help myself. This means I now have to walk extra long every day to even attempt to lose weight! Even your \"De-lite\" thin crust pizzas are so good. Thin crust? So what! I end up eating more slices. Your stuffed pizzas are ridiculously tasty. I'm going to have your pizza crust tested for habit forming drugs! .

Until next time Papa Murphy's Pizza on Stephanie!"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's chicken garlic pizza restored my faith in pizza. I have been to Papa Murphy's a few times now and each time I got something different and loved it! The service is quick and helpful and the pizza is wonderful. I recommend it to all my friends and coworkers!"}
{"text":"make your own pizza! wow this is such a good price for the size of the pizza and what you want on it! they give you so much toppings compared to any other pizza joints. the only trouble i had was to take it home! it barely fit in the passenger seat so i had to drive carefully and not to slam on the breaks so i wont lose my dinner lol. ALSO im a small asian and this pizza is bigger than me! 

it took awhile to cook at home. i baked it in the oven it was a bit watery so i put my slice in the small toaster to dry it up a bit and to make the crust crispy. pizza is better when the crust is a bit crispy. 

overall i like this pizza place! 

if your starving and want to eat pizza right away... this isnt the place for you cuz you have to bake it yourself!"}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite take out pizza venue. Great customer service,  great prices, and oh yes, I've never had a pizza that is anything other than outstanding. Can't say enough, you ROCK Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"A different take on pizza.  They make em and you bake em.  I liked the employees and how neato it is to just make it yourself.  Same amount of wait but if anything goes wrong, it's on you!  Try it out :)"}
{"text":"Ok I do not see what all the rave is about with this pizza. I do not know if it is because I was a chef working in italian restaurants, but this pizza is not good. I would also say that my husband who would eat anything, does not like this pizza. 

I give it two stars because the customer service is good and the toppings are fresh. The dough has no flavor and the tray they provide you to cook with, mainly the thin crust, sticks to the pizza. I have tried this place three times thinking maybe it was the pizza i received.....still the same thing. I even transferred the pizza to a pizza stone but it still lacks flavor. I am pretty surprised at how much they charge for the quality. Save yourself a few bucks and buy a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Super RUDE staff! When I asked for the ladies manager - she told me she was the owner! How sad."}
{"text":"You know for a pizza place set up like a subway it isn't that bad! 
When we want a cheep easy dinner this place is great! 
They are super cheap and fast and you bake the pizza at home. They aren't stingy with topping either witch is nice to see!

Can't eat inside there are no tables it simply come in choose topping they get it all ready in front of you and then you are off!

Quick easy and cheep"}
{"text":"Papa murphy's gourmet veggie. I dream about it.

We have ordered other pizzas but this is THE one. My husband has tried their pepperoni and still surprisingly  prefers this veggie pizza. It is piled HIGH with tons of delicious veggies (the good stuff- artichokes, zucchini, etc) and cheese. And it has a tasty, zippy garlic sauce.

Service is always super friendly.

Look for their coupons in the mail. Not drastic savings, but a few bucks off. And tastes better than Dominoes."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, and the customer service is outstanding. Always spotless, and I like the variety of toppings that they offer!"}
{"text":"So why would I cook my own pizza?  Because at this place I can get just artichokes and sun dried tomatoes and I'm willing to heat my house with the oven to have it my way!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we must've come on an off night. Ambiance was weird. Someone (manager maybe) looking over the pizza girls shoulder. Like for her to watch out to not put too many toppings. Well. There was not enough sauce , cheese OR toppings. We did half n half pizza we got a 1/4 n 3/4 pizza served to us with not even one slice of meat per piece of pizza. We have been coming to papa murphys for 25 years, starting in Oregon long before they ever came to Vegas. We are extremely disappointed in the quality here compared to what we are accustomed to. My husband wanted to take the pizza back.. it was a serious downer for our pizza dinner night. Next time we are headed to Nor@'s."}
{"text":"The best papa murphys in town. Hopefully it'll stay good as time goes on. Thank you to everyone who makes your location so good!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Papa Murphy's! Been eating there for years, just got 2 family pies today for a birthday party at this new location.  It was a hit with all!

It's a take and bake pizza joint with the freshest meats and veggies around...seriously!  You can ask for toppings on the side so you can customize every slice!  They have convection oven instructions as well.  With convection you can make pizzas on both racks at the same time and they cook perfectly! (basically, just like any other convection recipe, reduce heat 25 degrees and everything else is the same)

Online ordering is available and this restaurant is destined to do great business in this neighborhood.  Welcome to 85260 Papa!"}
{"text":"Papa murphy's is the best take home pizza ever. Not only that, but the crew at this location is always smiling and willing to help and talk to you. Plus the prices are phenomenal.  Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"1 star for location. 1 star for clean store. However everything else was not so great. Not welcomed just two people standing there making pizza. Walked to the register a young male walked over and said \"what do you want?\" I said whatever pizza is pepperoni and $10 or less. He asked how is he supposed to know what cost $10 or less... Uh. Jee. Idunno. Because you work here...? Finally figured out it was a large. But customer service needs work. A lot of work. Also the pizza. Yes it's good however there is a TON of grease! Like 10 paper towels worth of grease..."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza made from good quality ingredients. I've NEVER had a bad experience at Papa Murphy's. This is also probably the best reheat in the microwave the next day pizza there is (which is a must for me)."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's pizza. Always fresh, quality ingredients used. This is take&bake. They make the pizza fresh for you and then you take it home and bake it in your oven whenever you like. They have a nice medium thickness to the crust but also have a thin variety and a stuffed double crust version which are all excellent. Plus the pizza reheats the next day in the microwave wonderfully!"}
{"text":"I had a little issue with a visit. The GM reached out to me to correct the problem. As usual I'm very happy with them."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's pizza!!  Its so much cheaper than going to a place like Pizza Hut, Barro's, etc. They have a LOT of options, and of course you can customize. They also have lots of coupons online you can use for an even better deal! I love their DeLite pizza, a cripsy thin crust. But their regular crust and even stuffed pizzas are excellent too. They are always quick & very friendly, & you just take it home & bake it!  So easy and delicious!"}
{"text":"These folks helped sponsor the Huntersville/ Cornelius Relay for Life, that's where I had my first taste of their delicious pizza and received and coupon. I cashed in my coupon Saturday night and oh my yum! What a concept too! You decide what toppings you're up for, they have insane specials all the time, they make their own dough fresh daily and add your toppings right there in front of you. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE it! Fresh, quick and easy. Love I can warm this up when I'm ready. Not your typical frozen nasty ingredients. I was most IMPRESSED by the staff, managers and I think the owner. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We had a pizza here about 2 years ago and were hugely disappointed. However, my mother in law had a party and served pizza from here that was amazing. We've been back twice since and each time they've been great! Can't beat the price, either...especially with the coupons they ALWAYS have online."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pizza but I wanted something that wasn't going to absolutely kill my diet.  I had seen ads for Papa Murphy's deLITE pizzas so I decided to try one.  I called the location by my house to put in my order and the guy said it would be about 10 minutes.

I got there pretty close to the 10 minute time frame and the girl was finishing it up when I walked in.  She finished up quickly and came over to take my payment.  After she slid my card she said there was an error on the machine that she didn't know what it meant so she grabbed someone from the back to take a look.  He came out and did something to fix it.  He brought the girl and another employee over to show them what it meant and how to fix it and kind of tossed me my receipt without really acknowledging me or anything.  I wasn't sure if I was done or not so I waited for a minute but he contined with his demonstration so I just took my receipt and pizza and walked out.

The pizza was delicious and I was happy it was done in a timely manner but I didn't appreciate being treated as an afterthought to a cash register demonstration when all I wanted was just a \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day.\"  I don't think that's too much to ask for."}
{"text":"We have been going to Papa Murphy's for years and were so happy when this location opened so close to home. This is the first time I've said I won't go back, at least to this location. The staff is clueless. It's Tuesday and if you go here a lot you know any pizza is $10 on Tuesday. I ordered one of their stuffed crusts and the guy told me it was $12 because the owner said they had to charge $12 for stuffed pizzas. The quality and customer service is horrible. When we called the owner Spencer he was not helpful or willing to listen. He didn't take any responsibility for his employees behavior. The service wasn't great when they first opened and we thought it was because they were new and would get better. They have not gotten better only worse. We will be going back to the Papa Murphy's on Aliante from now on."}
{"text":"You kinda get what you pay for with this chain. Old reviews in place aren't really all that helpful, but it was pretty clean when I was there and no one looked entirely like a stoner. Who really knows these days anyway?

Pizza was good, staff was functional, chain chain blah blah. No complaints by me."}
{"text":"You buy it! You bake it! This idea is not half backed (see what I did there?) This is a fun concept. Oh and the pizza is very good as well! If you sign up for their email club you get all kinds of coupons. I should mention that I was introduced to them because they sponsored a blood drive, so there you go, they care about the community as well. So stop in, buy a raw pizza, take it home, put that bad boy in the oven, and presto! Dinner is served! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Tuesday is the best time to get a good deal on pizza. Fresh ingredients, quick service and friendly staff. Cook the pizza and it comes out piping hot from the oven."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, reasonably-priced, and the staff is awesome. I'm in town visiting my friend who's a regular and we swung by--I was treated very kindly."}
{"text":"Sarcastic employee. Ask a simple question and get an answer accompanied by rolled eyes and condescending attitude. Last time I will pick up a pizza here."}
{"text":"Never had this pizza before. Went in feeling like I might be overwhelmed but the woman at the front counter was helpful. I ended up getting two pizzas to try. Garlic Chicken with Green onions and a pepperoni. They were a bit pricy, but once baked, delicious. I think a coupon is necessary when getting Papa Murphys. But as a special treat it's great. The air bubbles were a bit large in both pizzas, I don't know how to avoid those. 

Anyway... Both pizzas were really good. I'm not normally a left overs type of person, but I definitely took the garlic chicken pizza with me to work for lunch the next day. Yummy.


Edit: should've checked my locations before posting a review. I accidentally posted this review first for a different store. Silly me. Apologies."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I like the idea of taking it home and baking it fresh. I ordered the stuffed chicken bacon pizza. I like being able to watch them make my pizza. They prepped it all in about 4-5 minutes. Taste was good. But it tastes more like a homemade pie, rather than from a restaurant. I attribute that mostly to the baking method. They get extra points for being super friendly and giving a military discount. I'll definitely try them again to see how their other crusts and pizza combinations pan out."}
{"text":"What a great idea! I love the convenience of being able to grab a pizza and bake it at home whenever I want. It's the perfect solution for me when I don't want to cook, but I'm coming home outside of dinner hours.

This location was very clean inside and the employees were very professional. I was immediately greeted when I entered, but not rushed to place my order. The menu board over the preparation line was easy to read and clearly outlined the different pizza options with pricing. They also offer a couple of salad options, bread sides, and cookie dough. 

Papa Murphy's is also a very affordable option. I happened to come in on a Tuesday which is $10 pizza night. $15 for a large pizza and a salad seemed more than reasonable to me. They also have coupons that come in the mail. 

It didn't take long to have my order prepared. From the time I entered the shop until the time I left was less than 10 minutes. I overhead another customer coming in for an order he placed online which I didn't realize was an option, but I'll try for next time. Even as a walk-in my wait wasn't long.

Now for the food. The pizza was actually pretty good, it definitely exceeded my expectations for a take and bake pizza. The crust baked nicely and had a good taste. The amount of topping was perfect. Overall, the tastes came together nicely and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. The instructions on the packaging made it easy to bake the pizza to perfection. The salad was a generous portion for the price and was also full of fresh ingredients. It was more than just lettuce with toppings like black olives, bell pepper, tomatoes, and cheese."}
{"text":"We order from here regularly and are always happy with the quality of their pizzas. The prices are good and the wait is never too long. Our favorite it the vegetarian delight thin crust."}
{"text":"We went to this location to try out the pizzas as we often like to try different places out. We ordered 2 large pepperoni's 1 large cheese and a stuffed pizza. Overall they were good, a bit pricey but it was a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Try the thai chicken pizza - we crave it now! Add pineapple!"}
{"text":"Another great night of Papa Murphy's Pizza. Good food reasonable prices and enjoy at home !"}
{"text":"Two years ago this place was awesome.  Great staff, efficient, friendly.

Now the people answering the phone act like they are too bothered to take an order.  The person at the register ALWAYS rings me up wrong the first time.  Can't figure out coupons, doesn't know the menu.... disappointing."}
{"text":"Before I stumbled on this place I use to be a big petter piper fan never liked any other pizza from big chain food places. When I first came here I thought of subway, but more clean, military discount, and more friendly. They took me through the whole process and everything they had to offer without asking. I must say when I got home I had some more questioned so I called them and they told me that I could and should cook the pizza on the plate that it had come on. They was not upset or rushed me off the phone, nothing calm polite and even offered for me to call them when I have eaten to tell them how was my first pizza. From that day forward I come here and I recommend papa to everyone. All that needs left from this place is delivery"}
{"text":"So the new mesa location really good customer service great service, clean, really great priced and best of all the pizza... I thought it was weird at first they make I bake but honestly fast like lil Caesars and made like subway idea was great."}
{"text":"Great pizza but mediocre customer service.  Food prepper sneezed while making my pizza (over her shoulder but not covered). Gross.  The order taker talked too fast so I didn't understand what she said (she said it twice and I didn't get it). She begrudgingly walked to a display to demonstrate the different sizes. Also, her apron was really soiled. 

The pizza is a great value and very tasty. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent PaPa Murphys very often for the simplicity of it, the price and the wife and kids really like them. However, they have stopped their pizza rewards stamp card program, and their prices have increased quite a bit. What used to be a value pizza has now become the same price if not more than a pizza I can go purchase already baked and ready to go with the same quality or better.

Sorry, but I cant justify spending the same amount of money on a pizza I have to go get, bake in my oven, when I can order one at the same price and brought to my door."}
{"text":"Ordered our pizza thin crust. Two meats and  lots of cheese, it baked up wonderfully. My wife loved it too, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5* because they saved the day for me.  I had two sleeping children in the car ( mid summer) but needed to pick up our order.  I parked out front called them and a worker brought the pizza to me!  Besides that you can't beat the quality/price of the pizza.  $5 faves are the best!"}
{"text":"MOST of the time I get the best service at this location. Today I has someone different helping me named Nastasha. She threw the thin crust pizza pie down on the counter and grabbed another one after I told her I didn't want thin crust. She was so rude and I'm the nicest person ever. I don't deserve that type of treatment at any establishment! I had to rate 5 star because my hubby and I love the pizza so much. I drive 15 minutes to get there and had to deal with her.  There is another guy that works there that usually makes my pizza and he's so sweet every single time! I just feel that the company should know how their associates are engaging with the customers."}
{"text":"Tasty custom take and bake pizzas, great for pizza night. Amazing service, and the prices aren't too bad considering they use all fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found out Papa Murphy's is in our area! Yay! Great pizza's and great cookie dough."}
{"text":"They are fast here and also helpful they will do a half and half of whatever you want for the picky ones at home. They have salad and minis also sweet baked pizzas for your sweet tooth. Make sure to take advantage of the coupons that come in the mail."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is trying to take over, but I think Americans and I are to lazy to buy into it. I agree with Shannon on this one. Why pay for a Pizza that you have to go home and cook when you can pay the same or a little more and not have to anything but eat! Maybe it is the college student in me but if I want Pizza for cheap I go to the freezer section,and if i want a tastier upgrade I order it. There is no middle ground for me on this one. Papa Murphy's does have decent pizza and menu items though. Don't get me wrong I'm not completely trying to diss them! 

Moral of the story is I am lazy and I either want to cook or don't want to at all period."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! When i first walked in i was greeted right away which made me feel welcome. I was kinda skeptical by the whole take n bake concept but the manager Stephanie put me at ease by letting me know its fast, easy and fresh. Dough made in house, fresh veggies cut daily... U cant beat that! I got The Cowboy pizza and it was delicious. Will definitely be back soon. Most likely on 10$ Tuesday...whaaaat?"}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing! It was my first time in and I bought a pizza and a cinnamon wheel, and the staff there was extremely nice and got my order out quick. They even explained the cooking instructions for me because I'd never been there. The food tasted excellent, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love Papa Murphy's this location is fast friendly and on top of their game. We love their pizza, thin crust"}
{"text":"Pizza here is reliably good, Andrew was friendly. Best pizza place within a few mins of my house, for what that's worth."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We order the gluten-free option and it is great. The quality of the toppings is excellent. The crew is polite and fast. Great business model. Great product. Follow the cooking instructions, and check as you come close to maximum bake time. Great job, Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this location!!! I had high hopes for them too. I've never used papa murphys before and I decided to try for our family. We bought two pizzas and everything was really good. We were impressed and talked about using them at least once a week to feed our family. 

However, the second time we bought pizzas from there, we put the cheese in for 10 minutes. I took it out and the pizza was completely stuck to the plate they give you to cook them on. I was so confused because this didn't happen last time! I called the store and they were no help at all. The manager just sat silent on the phone when I told her what happened. I told her how the other pizza didn't come out that way. She really didn't care. She seriously was the rudest person even saying that we must have not followed the directions and it's not her fault we can't read the directions. I was so awestruck from the response. When I was a teenager I worked at a pizza place and I know it only cost restaurants $1.50 to make a pizza. I'm not saying I should have gotten a free pizza, but saying it's our fault and hanging up on me is not good for business. The sad thing is, I just told my sister to use this place for a quick meal and I had to go back and tell her to never use it. I also will never go back and I had to take myself off the text they send me. Truly sad. We really thought it would be a helpful place to buy a quick dinner. 


I really hope no one encounters this manager. They need to start hiring respectful managers that actually care about their customers. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good, goes great with FOX news."}
{"text":"Take and bake sign was small and hard to see, out of towers , talked to staff about visiting nothing mentioned about cooking it, the establishment seemed to have some cooking facilities, but staff was no help, very poor questioner service."}
{"text":"Having gone with family to the one in Winston Salem, I was happy to go to this one to have our New Year's Eve pizza dinner.  The location is tiny and not the easiest to find but the staff was definitely friendly, the food is yummy and they managed to get our complex order right.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Our standby for a quick meal that never disappoints. Sign up for Papa Murphy's specials by text. I ordered online, arrived 10 minutes early and everything was ready to go. I even got free chocolate chip cookie dough for dessert. The service didn't disappoint, everything was bagged and the door held open for me when I left.  I love a polite smile, cheerful disposition and good manners. Thank you."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Papa Murphy's in WA and was incredibly excited when they opened one so close to where we live.  There is no better pizza, delivery or take-out but what I've been extremely impressed with is the service at this location. The owner, Wes, knows his customers by name, hires only the best, and is obviously meticulous with his training because the pizza always comes out perfect.  Oh, and the prices are awesome!  If you haven't given them a try, do it today!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place for pizza. The prices are great, pizza is good and the staff and owner are super friendly. We are glad is here in the neighborhood.  It is my go to place when I don't want to cook.  Use your coupons and get a punch card."}
{"text":"Was delighted to discover this place was close to our Air B N B rental. New phone ordered four pizzas for the 12 of us and had plenty of leftovers. Even with three teen boys.  You really do bake these on the car board pan provided and the pan doesn't burn LOL."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. We had never had Papa Murphy's before we moved down to Goodyear, so we decided to try it out. The staff is always super-friendly and helpful, and the prices here aren't bad. The staff always makes sure you know what to do with the take-and-bake pizza, just in case you've never had one before :)"}
{"text":"The SWEETEST staff and the BEST food! Love having Papa Murphy's in the neighborhood! :)"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time in the last 10 days picking up one of their new large taco pizza on sale for only $10. (Don't judge, it really is that good! Lol) the workers have been very friendly the last 2 visits and I have been in and out in under 10minutes. The toppings are perfectly distributed, you take it home and cook it in your own oven. (Done in 12-18minutes)  and the taste really is amazing. I have been telling people to try the taco pizza. We get ours with beef, but the workers say you can get it with chicken..I think chicken sounds gross..just my opinion.haha! Anyways, if you haven't tried Papa Murphy's on Kirby Ave, I suggest you do. Great pizza, friendly workers, and convenient."}
{"text":"Very professional friendly attitudes by all employees! 
Pleasure to give this store my business. Will recommend them to everyone!
THAN YOU!"}
{"text":"My family enjoys a take and bake pizza several times a month. It's always the best option for having a hot and properly cooked pizza to go. There are generally coupons or deals so I can often feed the three of us for $15 or so. We enjoy our standard order, but have also had a good time trying the variety available."}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price! A large pie is $10 with 5 topping options (on Tuesdays) I love that the chicken is anti- antibiotics raised. The service is always friendly. There's a gluten free crust along with thin, pan, original, and even stuffed crust. The take home cookie dough is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a first timer of Papa Murphy's Pizza.  I'm really glad I got to try it.  

First off, if you are not familiar, it is a Take and Bake Pizza place.  So they don't cook it there.  They make the pie there topped with whatever you please and you take it home to cook.  The cook time is maybe about 15-20 minutes, depending on crispy you like your pie.  

There are three types of crust, Original, deLite think crust, and Stuffed pizza/calzones.  I went with Original.  

I tried Papa's Favorite (which is like a supreme pizza) and the Gourmet Chicken Garlic.  Both were delicious.  It really makes a difference when you cook it yourself.  Oh man, the ooey gooey cheesiness is yuuuuuuumy.  All the fresh ingredients they use that seriously makes all the difference.  

The prices are decent, you get more for your money here then at your regular mainstream pizza places.  Did I mention they have a Pick-Up drive through?  When they make it for you, they put it together in a matter of 5-10 minutes.  So you can call ahead, drive there, get your pie....plus get your beers next door at Lee's, LOL."}
{"text":"So we get pizzas here for a while and we like them we get the desert but it has chocolate on it and we're not big fans of chocolate  and we used to pick all the chips off so we asked the manager who appears to be new there to make it without chocolate and he does it for us and we appreciate it he's always nice to us and the food is good thank you and your crew"}
{"text":"Everyone in here was so incredibly friendly! Good customer service deserves a review. Super helpful finding deals and answering my questions about the gluten free crust. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Pizza had such a light topping. It was a one topping, bacon. It was like 98% cheese and 2% bacon. Still pizza, and good, but whoever made the pizza was seriously withholding. -_-"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is a take and bake pizza place.  We like the fact that you can pick what you want on your pizza and they don't own a freezer so everything is fresh.  The taste and quality is just okay.  Today we got the Italian salad and the lettuce was wilted which was disappointing.  We have noticed that the regular crust is extremely filling and thick, so we always opt for the d'light crust.  All the pizzas come with baking instructions and a telephone survey.  If you complete the survey there is a code to write down and you get a free cookie dough on your return visit.  The cookie dough is strange, it doesn't smell like anything when its baking and when the cookies are done they are pretty greasy.  Papa Murphy's is a good alternative to delivery as far a price goes, in fact they advertise that they accept food stamps, but the quality could be a little better."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza,  can take home and cook in a short time and you can make it as crisppy as you like it."}
{"text":"Welcoming staff directed me to an easy dinner. Call ahead or walking and choose your crust and toppings amd they will take care of you. Make sure to utilize the coupons they send for maximum savings you will be overjoyed with them. Trust."}
{"text":"No problems ordering at this Papa Murphy's and the pizzas are always tasty. Their cookies are pretty good too. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. We recently had a half Hawaiian and half pepperoni at home which was filled with toppings, and ended our meal with some tasty mint chocolate chip cookies. I do wish they were open later though!"}
{"text":"Take and Bake! Papa Murphy's is like the Subway of pizza, with the speed and efficiency of Jimmy John's. You order your pizza, and in a wink of an eye it's made right in front of you. 

Baking instructions are easy, and the pizza tastes really good for something that is baked in a regular oven. Someday when we have a grill I'd like to grill some pizza and see how it tastes!

They seem to always offer coupons in the mail, and they also have family deals, as well as daily deals. Service has also been cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"The Spinach, Artichoke, Bacon Pizza has officially made it onto my favorite pizza list!
The sauce on the pizza was unbelievably tasty and flavorful. MUST TRY! I wish there was a Papa Murphy's in California, it would totally beat Papa Johns!"}
{"text":"Go and pick your own toppings, crust, sauce, etc and take it home and bake it. Actually pretty good pizza and the price is not bad. She loaded it with toppings which was awesome and hooked us up with whatever I wanted to add! Not the best pizza in the world but definitely as good as Dominoes or the like..."}
{"text":"Hannah was great!! Lucky to have her, I will certainly continue to frequent this location.  I have yet to have a better experience at a Papa Murphy's. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Perfectly located right across the street from where I live. Fast and friendly service. Ordered a large pizza and was surprised to hear it was $10!! We're happy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love that the owners work in-store often. Jarod and his parents are so friendly; along with the everyone else. Very courteous and never rushes anyone; even if there are others in line. Customer service at it's finest! I much rather stop here and spend my money for pizza than anywhere else. The pizza is fresh and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept as far as take your own pizzas home to make goes but not done well. 

The person making the pizza just over cheesed and over sauced the whole thing. When I cooked it and ate it it was just a terrible mess. It felt as if a little kid was throwing things together."}
{"text":"Not even a one star.... I ordered a pizza I get it unbaked... for a first timer it will be my last... I hate u papa Murphy's... what kind of service is this... u should leave a note on ur site to tell people like me who order food cause I don't want to cook that I need to cook it.... u guys r just the worst"}
{"text":"My wife picked up a large sausage last night, within an hour she was throwing up and we are now both in the hospital with food poisoning. One of the worst experiences I've ever had and we certainly will never be coming here again."}
{"text":"We have been to Papa Murphy's many times since it opened at this location. We have never been disappointed. Love the meat lovers pizza and the cowboy pizza. Have tried both thin and regular crust. Both are great. We are not fans of thick crust so we probably won't try the pan pizza but it is available for those who like it."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! 
We called ahead of time and ordered our pizza. Super friendly on phone. Asked for pick up after 3pm. 
After 3, we went in and were greeted right away, again super friendly. Kinda crowded at the time but with 2 min we had our pizza paid for. The clerk gave us instruction on how best to cook it and we left that quick. Quite pleasant experience. 

We got baked our pizza for 8 min on their tray and then moved to rack. Pizza came out super crispy, how we like it, with cheese melted perfectly. We let cool and then sliced into it (using my NCC1701-D pizza cutter) and plated. 

This pizza, no joke, was better than any pizza we had in San Diego. Really good!! 

Tuesday $10 large pizza deal, can't beat it. 

Will defiantly order again and again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They were quick, precise, & welcoming. Stephanie is the absolute best! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like the pizza particularly the Gluten Free! The Stuffed pie like pizzas did not cook as well for me and my family but they were deliciously prepared. Takes longer than instructions in my stand oven and a pizza stone works better than the baking board provided. Overall very pleased."}
{"text":"A very nice group of young people are working at the store, two stars for them. But I did not get the sense that they were very experienced. 

I ordered in advance, online, but they didn't start making my food until I arrived,  stating they had a big rush in the past hour. The online system said my pizza would take 45 minutes. Somewhere in that chain of events something is broken. My pizzas should have been waiting for me. They offered free cookie dough to ease the pain. 

The pizza was not good. The dough was very doughey, almost as if it was undercooked, but we followed the directions closely. My wife is an amazing baker so we know our oven works well. The flavor of the ingredients was bitter which is strange for a pizza. After eating part of one slice each, we threw out the rest. We will not be returning. Maybe we just don't like Papa Murphys.  I get much better pizza from Pizza Hut which isn't a high bar, and the price is about the same including delivery and tip."}
{"text":"Came here at the spur of the moment. I had a coupon for a free fav pizza with the purchase of any large or XL pizza. A fav pizza is a pre-made cheese, pepperoni or sausage pizza. We decided to get the pepperoni. We also got a large pizza half beef and half ham. For both pizzas it was $10 plus tax and they take the Ballantyne corporate card so after that it was about $8 and some change. I couldn't believe how cheap it was! 

Instructions are easy to do. Pizza are a good size. Their traditional tomato sauce is really good. Both pizzas had a good amount of toppings on it. Pizzas came out great. Cheese was melted and crust was slightly brown. Pizza was fluffy which I liked. 

The customer service was top notch. The guy there was super friendly and helpful. When he made our pizzas, he walked around the counter to hand me the pizzas and opened the door for me. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon online for a large one topping pizza, cheesy bread and a tub of cookie dough for $10. I came here on my lunch break and put in my order. It was ready in just a few mins. The whole experience was great. I had no issues baking my food. It tasted great and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"When I first went here I honestly didn't know it was take and bake pizza. LOL!!  Wanted some pizza and decided to try a new place. We had never heard of Papa Murphy's before. Still bought the pizza after finding out they were take and bake only and it was pretty good. The gluten free pizza is very good also. Give them a try, just call home and have someone pre-heat so the oven is ready to go when you get home."}
{"text":"Great service! They are quick and always friendly. I will be back. They are one of the few places that have gluten free pizza dough which is really good. Kat is always friendly and smiling."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get pizza to bake at home.  We call and put our order in and when we get there it is ready.  Love the DelitLite crust with the white sauce Chicken, Artichoke s it is very special."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had brought a PM pizza home once a few months ago, and I was pretty impressed, so I decided to pick it up one evening after work when I didn't feel like cooking. It's a nice, small little store, and the guy at the register was patient with me as I figured out how to order. I got a pepperoni pizza with cheesy bread for about $12.  For the price, I think it's a pretty good deal. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other pizzas they have."}
{"text":"Went there recently to get a pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  The store is very clean, modern, and orderly.  The staff was extremely kind and helpful.  I really felt the warmth about the place.  Some business have staff which can be rude, condescending and they use sarcasms.  Tearing at the flesh.  But not at this particular place of business.  I was so warmly greeted by such a kind staff who was more than helpful when answering my questions.  It's been many years since my last pizza at papa Murphy's.  The nearest store is very far from my house.  Like 30 min drive.  But I will continue frequenting this place because of the friendly staff and most of all a quality product.  No other pizza chain sells better pizza then papa Murphy's.  I feel the reason why they can afford better quality ingredients is because the business saves a ton of money not having to pay for the repair, maintenance, and upkeep of a pizza oven!  Pizza ovens are on all day to keep them preheated.  That's a lot of overhead costs in natural gas bill!  Not only that but the electric bill will still be sky high.  Because if you have several gas pizza ovens running all day you must keep the air conditioner running constantly too cool off the kitchen.  Whoever came up with the concept of take and bake papa Murphy's was a genius.  They pass the savings down to the customer.  I hope their prices will stay competitive."}
{"text":"Frequent customer of this location.  Seems to be going downhill.  Toppings are less and less and I have observed them not measuring the ingredients and just putting a handful on.  The last 2 pizzas have been disappointing.   I am hoping they get back to making a good pizza.  I am hoping that management reads this as well and realizes that they need to make a better more consistent pizza!  Will give it another try but may be time to find a new pizza place."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to walk in and be greeted with a smile and over-all good service!  Extensive menus and yummy pizzas are a plus."}
{"text":"Read your coupons carefully!!! They bombard you with coupons then it takes an hour for an online order to go through and get the discount Or you can pay more and get it right away. I will unsubscribe and find my pizza elsewhere. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Ordered ahead and when I showed up my order was wrong so we had to wait for them to remake it, so much for calling ahead :/"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last week. We drive by it often enough and see the commercials so we decided to give it a try. I found a coupon on their website for a large half pepperoni, half Hawaiian pizza and since we liked both kinds we went for it. My boyfriend went to pick it up and he said he liked watching them put the ingredients on because they were fast and accurate. Everyone, he said, was friendly and they gladly accepted our coupon. Once the pizza was home we just followed the instructions and cooked it for about 16 minutes. It was wonderful!! The crust was soft but slightly crisp on the very bottom, the cheese was still \"melty\" since it had just come from our oven, and the ingredients tasted so fresh! Hands down this will be our \"cheap\" pizza of choice, the expensive pizza coming from Oregano's which we also love."}
{"text":"This is the best location! They always change their gloves and use a new spatula for my gluten free pizza!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed by the level of great customer service this location has.  The coupons which come in the mail three times per week coupled with the phone app make it very easy to get a large 3-4 topping pie for less than $10.   The pie is real simple and easy to cook.  You need a big oven so make sure your oven is big enough for a large pie. I liked the hand tossed pie.  The plain cheese pie was very salty not sure why as none of the others were salty.  Great place to pick up a pie for the kids, special occasions etc.  Great prices, Great services and great tasting pizza pies."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. We get pepperoni pizza with green olives on one side and onions on the other. They have green olives, which most places don't carry. The price point is a little high. If it were closer to $10 I might get it more often."}
{"text":"We've had their pie over six times and have yet to be disappointed. It is fresh and delicious very time. They are also accommodating to special requests. Fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I have them back home in WA and when I found out that one is only 4 miles away from my house, yup that's right, I eat here often. I get the family size cowboy minus black olives and replace them with jalapeños and it feeds me for 2-3 days. This location is always clean, quick and friendly. My GF is from CLT and when I introduced her to PM she fell in love with it."}
{"text":"FRIENDLY COUNTER HELP. Pizza nicely made. clean place, they do get busy. It was no problem calling ahead to get my ordered started."}
{"text":"Don't Eat Here!!!! Me and my husband went here last night and got food poisoning. Ordered thin crust pizzas and by early morning was in the bathroom with the chills. Wish I could give a 0 for ratings but not an option."}
{"text":"The management is horrible here they make you wait about 15 minutes to pick up your pizza don't know how to handle customers the guy making the pizzas with the beard doesn't have the beard covered so hair Goes in your pizza. Craig should loose his job for being rude to customers. And the police just came for the bad review Papa murphys sucks"}
{"text":"First time here for pizza and salad
The only thing I knew before walking in was I know it's take home pizza...

The employees were very friendly and helpful, they executed their jobs perfectly
It's a good thing I went on a Tuesday because they have a $10 Large pizza deal which was perfect for me 
I got a Large pizza split in half
Half was just cheese and sauce (boring)
The other half was papa's favorite
Papa's favorite consists of sauce, cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and black olives...
Sooooo good! 

I also got a regular garden salad with ranch and the whole thing was about $14

The guy making my pizza (Brandon) was very nice and filled me in on the heating instructions as well as tips for my next visit

The pizza is super good and the salad is good as well :) 

Ps- next time I want to try the cookie dough and/or the dessert pizzas"}
{"text":"Great deals! Sign up for text deals! Very cool!

The girls were super nice!

Love this concept. Pizza was yummy of course!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are in a mood to experiment or create, this is the place that satisfy your skills. We bring in from here and do our toppings as we want."}
{"text":"I come to this Papa Murphys all the time.  The stuffed pizza seems to be new and it's fabulous!  The meat is wrapped inside.  Yummm!"}
{"text":"Love papa murphy's anyway but I really dig the customer service at this location.  The owner is about to be retired military and he's a real nice guy.  Dominique was very nice too.  Can't complain about a military discount either.  The place was suuper clean and comfortable.

**Update - I wrote this edit forever ago but never came online and finalized it so I'm not sure if it's still the same and I'm sure the owner probably retired since then.  I moved but if I lived closer I would check it out and update the review for sure. **"}
{"text":"Great service at this location. Thank you Andrew and alyza for your great customer service!! And yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"So what is wrong with people??? You people that are writing complaining about cost really have NO IDEA what it's like to own and run a franchise. (yes I do). if you like the pizza, go back, if you don't, go somewhere else, but don't ruin someones business because you are ignorant!! You are part of the reason why America is not the country it was. This country is built on small business, but due to the internet and people that feel entitled, (YOU) this is no longer the case!!!! And then you have the gaul to complain about big business!!!! I love papa murphy's pizza, and the location on Via Linda is amazing! I know a lot of people will have a problem with my post, but you know what?? Bite me!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow
First weekend of the playoffs and they have one employee? Wtf
If she would have told me she was the only one working at it was gonna take 4o minutes I would have no thanks.
No excuse 
Will never go back to PaPa shit hole"}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars and here is why. 1 star because the price was right. They have a Wednesday special for 50% off your order when you order online using coupon code Wed50 and the other star because of all the fresh ingredients. 

I have been longing to try this place. I constantly see the commercials and love pizza but was not at all impressed with the quality and taste. I drive by this place everyday and there are multiple locations across the valley but I was really expecting more from my local take and bake pizza shop. 

The instructions say to bake at 425 for 12-18 minutes. I baked for 12 and continued to baked until my desired crispness. The pizza comes on a thin white paper plate/cardboard box to cook on but when I checked my pizza after 15 minutes the pizza was still doughy on the bottom. The cheese was melting and turning brown on top but when I cut a slice to make sure it was done the pizza went limp and the cheese almost fell to the floor. I tried to continue cooking to see if the bottom would cook more but the cheese from the rest of the pizza kept bubbling over the sides. My perfectly prepared pizza now looking like melted cheese stuck to a cardboard box. 

I'll stick to my grocery store pizza or have it made and delivered to my door. This was a disaster."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh but the prices are a little high for having to bake your own pizza; don't get me wrong its a pretty standard pizza, hard to screw up, just different style of business. Their cheese bread is really good and its nice to be able to pick one up on the go."}
{"text":"Always great products with a professional  staff. Witnessed staff handle rude and discourteous  customers with professionalism and class . Love this place !!!"}
{"text":"Pizza made in the store and then you take it home to cook!  Affordable and lots of toppings! I like it and they don't scrimp on the ingredients!  Only takes about 15 minutes to cook up and enjoy at home."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I use to think this place was dumb \"who orders a uncooked pizza\", but after some friends invited me over for pizza and a movie I found myself asking \"where did you get this\". 
Papa Murphy's, was the answer. 

Fast forward  a year or so and they open one near my house. This location is really nice and clean , lots of parking and friendly staff. The pizza is top notch always taste great. So far my favorite is the stuffed chicken bacon one (drawing a blank on the official nane). 

You might ask why only 4 stars when I clearly love the pizza? Well its because it's take and bake, and to be honest I have messed up one or two from over cooking and one damn near set on fire. But if you are remotely good around an oven and know how to set a timer you should be fine. Just a hint I set several timers now ."}
{"text":"Christian was really Awesome and helpful explaining the menu to me! The pizza was awesome! They didn't skimp me on toppings! I think this is my new favorite pizza chain!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for about a year now. The young people that work there are always so nice and pleasant! 
The pizzas are wonderful. Always great deals going on. Just ask!!"}
{"text":"If you have ever had Papa Murphy's then you know what to expect. I really enjoy their pizza and it keeps well for leftovers. The staff was unbelievably friendly and it was very quick. Will definitely use in the future."}
{"text":"As the Yelp rating for 5-stars states, \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"

Comparing apples to apples, this Papa Murphy's is really as good as it gets when it comes to Take and Bake Pizza. Great quality crust and toppings, quick and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went after work. Ingredients looked old and some were spilling over. Service people were more interested in talking to each other than helping customers"}
{"text":"Cant get enough !! Love this pizza.. I bake the pizza when im ready and still hot when we sit at the dinner table. Pizza, bread sticks, cinnamon wheels & Choc Chip cookie dough are the TOP picks for my family!!"}
{"text":"We have been long time customers of this location. Original owners rocked. Today I can say I would never recommend anyone to this location again. We had a 2nd horrible experience last night and made a strong effort to let this store redeem itself. We ordered our two favorite pies last night. Family size pepperoni with extra cheese and a family size chicago style chicken bacon stuffed with no onions. We moved over the last few months to a home further away but felt we would continue to patronize this branch.  Long and the short of it...pizza number two was chock full of onions for the 2nd straight time. The last time this happened was on our previous visit and we just let it go. My wife at 8 months pregnant cant do onions so this time we called backed to explain.  Manager said they would replace the pie over the phone.  We wrapped up the uneaten pizza and rather than drive 10 miles back waited til this evening to return it. We were greeted with a new manger un familiar with our situation. To us it was a no brainer....here is an uneaten pizza being returned after being prepared wrong.  Just make us a new pie and move on. Instead....a call to the store owner was made and a half off coupon was offered. That was it. Final answer? Yes. That is all we can do was the response. Well....that 15.00 decision made at the upper level just cost this group not only our business for good but we will certainly share this experience with members of our neighborhood and church (the largest church in the area just around the corner from this establishment) Horrible experience. We even called them back after driving all the way home stunned by this business practice. Good riddance papa murphys. We will also be following up with a call to corporate.  Bad move and acutally bad pies now at this spot."}
{"text":"Just placed a pick up order for a gourmet chicken /artichoke WITHOUT bacon. When I got home, noticed the pizza had bacon. I am deathly allergic to bacon. Called and the person told us to come back and they would make a new pizza OR come back tomorrow and I could BUY another pizza but get half off.

So you want me to drive back, waste more time and gas money for your fault??? Not to mention I have a family waiting to eat dinner.

And your other solution is to BUY another pizza tomorrow???

What kind of service is this? Terrible is what it is. Your fault, your screw up and I have to suffer. I just paid $15 for a pizza I cannot eat.

This will be the last time I do business with this place. 

Unacceptable business practices and poor customer service. Your fault and you failed to fix it."}
{"text":"After waiting in front of four employees for five minutes with no one  even offering to give service. I spoke to the manager which was a very young inexperienced person in customer service and by me using one cuss word you thought that his life has ended. But what the facts are is he doesn't train his people for service and his store owners apparently don't train him to be able to train people so hopefully they'll read this review and take some time and put more energy into customer service.

Update. Owner called immediately after leaving a message at a store after she had already left after business hours. What an awesome lady way to take care of customers she knew I wasn't looking for something free I just wanted to express that I was not happy with the service she in return showed nothing but sincere gratitude to fixing the problem and that's all I can ever ask for."}
{"text":"My favorite is the cookie dough...really. I'm a desert first eater. But I have had the Herb Chicken Mediterranean deLITE, the chicken Bacon Artichoke deLITE, the veggie and a few custom pizza's there. Its the best and the freshest pizza I have had in a long time. What I love about it is you pick it up and cook it when you are ready so it is always fresh when it hits the table. I love the thin crust since Im cutting down on carbs. The service is excellent, the place very clean and its owned and run but a husband and wife team. I'd much prefer supporting a small local business than a large corporate chain any day. I give them a high 5!"}
{"text":"I'm not used to making my own pizza but I can totally dig cheap pizza that's loaded w tons of toppings! Service is friendly and location is convenient!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Taco Grande is the best! Great staff and very clean location! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this chain before but I decided to give it a try once I received promotional material on the mail with discount coupons. I ordered their cheese breadsticks and the chicken bacon artichoke pizza. I had to admit that I was super hesitant at the idea of having to bake my own pizza. It was a concept I had not heard before and I thought giving the costumer an extra step seemed odd. The good thing though is that by following this process the pizza is super fresh and it uses super good clean ingredients. When I finished eating the pizza I did not feel bloated or super full like most fast food pizza chains usually do. I actually felt good! 

The pizza has a super thin crispy crust and not a lot of sauce. The star of this pizza are the fresh ingredients. I think that for the price and quality it can't be beat! I would definitely order again. 

If you want to try it out, call ahead of time because they do take a while to prepare the pizza."}
{"text":"I am writing this review after a second time trying Papa Murphy's Pizza. The first order, was by no means a bad experience. However, this time I got the Big Murphy's stuffed pizza. Overall, it was quite good considering that it's made quickly to order, it's cheap, and I finished the cooking myself with success.

To ensure that I had a well-cooked pizza, I preheated the oven to 350 degrees and cooked the pizza for 10 minutes on its original paper pan. At the same time the pizza was cooking, my pizza stone was in the oven warming up. After 10 minutes, I transferred the pizza over to the stone and finished its cooking. Using additional pans and stones are not required, as the pizza will cook fine on the included paper pan.

I ordered online via the smarrtphone app. The order was ready for me when I came to pick it up. No complaints.

Overall, I give this Papa Murphy's 5 stars because of the category in which it resides; It's pizza that's relatively cheap and I must make it myself. And because of the good experience I had with this current order, and the stuffed pizza which was very tasty, I have no problem giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a great find here in NC. Had the pan pie last week and it was awesome. A lost boy like me from the Bronx is very happy to find pizza like this here in Matthews !!!! Having the family size tonight. The people in this store couldn't be nicer if they tried. Better than most pizzas around here."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me a quarter century to realize that the take-and-bake pizza store that is Papa Murphy's actually tastes better than its delivery competitors!  One day as a I was ordering a pizza for takeout, my friend recommended Papa Murphy's... I am now a convert.  Never again will I order delivery!  

The worst part of it all is this location is now closing for business on Feb 15.

I ordered an all meat pizza and was so glad that they don't skimp on any ingredients.  My favorite part is the added cheese on top!  Nobody else does that!  The coupons in the mail also make this an affordable option for those lazy Sunday's.  I actually forgot to order the thing crust this time but it is my favorite crust.  The regular crust is also very good and cooks nice and evenly with their included cardboard(?) pan.

Next time you consider ordering takeout or delivery, I recommend picking up a Papa Murphy's and baking it to your liking!  Don't forget to ask for their punch card!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place, fast and friendly, always clean and I can feed my family a healthy meal"}
{"text":"My husband and I were searching for pizza to eat on a Friday night since we wanted a night in.  Didn't want to go with the typical, Pizza Hut/Dominos/Papa Johns. Our neighbor had mentioned Papa Murphy's and how the price was good and pizza even better.  We decided to try it out.  Arriving there we could pick the pre-made pizzas and also make some changes of our own (no olives please!)  You would honestly think that this pizza is like any other pizza... I honestly never like to write about pizza cause there's really nothing too special about it.  All in all pizza is hard to mess up.  This pizza is DELICIOUS, from the sauce to the crust to the toppings. SO FRESH and plenty enough, not to mention with our local coupons it was $13 for a family size aka huge!  I am currently eating one for breakfast as I write this review.  We got the regular cowboy, no olives, add pineapple.  So my pizza tests consist of how it tastes, straight out of the oven,  20 mins later, next day.  Papa Murphy's passed all 3 with flying colors!! We will be back.  Sorry no more chain pizza's for us as long as Papa Murphy's an option."}
{"text":"This time around was even better! These people are ballsmazing. *insert Karate Kid theme song here*"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! This was my first visit and I was throughly impressed. I ordered on line and it was very easy. My pizza was ready when I arrived and the staff were friendly. They took the time to explain to me about how to cook the pizza and made user the toppings were correct. When we cooked the pizza we were impressed. It was so fresh and it cooked perfectly. We had 2 pies, one regular crust and one thin. They were both great but I loved the thin crust. This is definitely my new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Expect slow service and a long wait. Lady was coughing all over and waited over 30 mon for half of my order.   Great let down."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza in las vegas. Trust me because I have had pizza from all over las vegas and this stuff is really good. The price is great and there is no taz because the food is not cooked. $8 means $8!"}
{"text":"I have been to several Papa Murphy's locations but have never seen the level of customer service this team displayed! Every member of this team was smiling when I came into the building, my order (which I had called in 5 minutes prior) was ready for me quicker than expected and as I exited the store the young lady opened the door and handed me my pizzas! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The crew here is always friendly and excel at customer service.  Very easy to understand instructions and of you burn or overcook it you have nobody to blame but yourself.  I normally go the one topping pepperoni and cooks to perfection on the supplied cooking tray.  

Tuesday's are $10 large any pizza on the menu days!  

Enjoy your pie!"}
{"text":"I usually have an orgasmic reaction to food, but pizza was never one of them.

Until I took Papa Murphy home. Thank you!

First of all, I did not expect to find the staff so friendly, I explained to them about a prior location (Stephanie and American Pacific) I had called and asked the time they were planning to close (Dec. 24. 2013) to ensure that I would have enough time after church to pick it up, when they said 8 I was more than ecstatic, so when I got there, at 7:08 to my surprise... they were closed... liars! LIARS!!!

So on to the next one, because my roomie and I were dead set on getting the pizza, we drove to the College location where we explained what happened and he sincerely apologized, he even honored these coupons we had that were specific to the Stephanie location. YAY! 

So delicious! Fresh ingredients! High Quality cheese!! 

Love Love LOVE Papa Murphys!"}
{"text":"This is now by far my favorite pizza in Huntersville, NC. The staff is great, the pizza is delicious, prices are amazing. This business is a great value to the Exit 23 business area."}
{"text":"Maybe this is the east coast pizza snob in me, but I'm not understanding the concept of being handed an uncooked pizza.  We didn't feel like cooking tonight, and woke up from a nap really hungry.. So we figured let's run out for take out.  I ordered a pizza, was handed it in 30 seconds...  Raw.  I had to take it home and cook it.  Makes no sense.

I'm told this is a really big chain on the west, and \"consistently voted #1 pizza chain in the country\", so maybe it's just me talking..  But umm..  There's no place like NY"}
{"text":"This is literally the silliest place I've ever seen.  I stopped in here one night because I didn't feel like cooking, and I thought I'd try the new pizza place on my block.  When I placed my order I was shocked at how quickly I was handed my pizza.  I'd say it was under a minute.  My pizza, however, was frozen!  I was dumbfounded.  The cashier instantly saw my disbelief and assured me that this is the \"best pizza in the world\".

Well, I can assure you that it isn't.  I'm not going to go so far as to compare this pizza to NYC or NJ.  I'm not even going to compare this \"pizza\" to Vegas powerhouses like Pizza Rock or Novacento.  Actually, I'm not going to compare this to Little Caesar's hot n' ready because:
1. Little Caesar's bare minimum pie tastes much better
2. Little Caesar's hot n' ready comes hot, ready, and NOT FROZEN!!

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that people order take out because they don't want to cook.  If I have to go out, grab food, bring it home, and still cook it; it would make sense to just pop in a Digiorno's.. which also tastes better than Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"We love this Papa Murphy's the owner is on site most of the time and she is one of the friendliest owners I have ever seen, she seems to work great with her crew, she acknowledges her customers like you are a friend. We love being able to pick up pizza and then make it whenever we are ready for it. We have never got a pizza from here that we have not liked. We love the Chicken Bacon Ranch and the Bacon, Bacon, Bacon."}
{"text":"I love the idea of taking your own pizza home and cooking it. They make it and I bake it. Joel was craving pizza and inspired by my sister-in-laws suggestion I had joined Papa Murphy's text club earlier that day. Which means I had a coupon for a free Favs Pizza with an order of another pizza. 

They have many different options and I love that you can get any pizza as a thin crust. Their specialty pizzas are really tasty. My husband's favorite is the Cowboy pizza. It has mushrooms, onions, sausage, olives and red sauce. Even their regular pepperoni pizza is yummy. It's always loaded with cheese and toppings. Plus, the price isn't bad either. Papa Murphy's staff is friendly and efficient. Can't ask for much more!

If your craving pizza skip the delivery and hit up Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"My husband suggested that we try Papa Murphy's for Sunday dinner because we were too lazy to cook a meal. We came in and were greeted by friendly staff. The restaurant was clean and inviting. I was a little confused about the concept but my husband told me to give it a try because he tasted one of their pizzas at a friend's house and fell in love. The staff member explained the entire process and went through the menu with me. We ordered the original pan pizza and I had pepperoni, spinach, and garlic on my side. My husband had the same on his side but added Italian sausage and bacon to his. When I tell y'all that pizza was BANGIN!!! It was SOOOO good!! Even the leftovers reheated in the oven tasted amazing! I would recommend anyone try Papa Murphy's. Trust me, it's not like the frozen pizza in the store. It's made right in front of you so it tastes even better than the delivery places! The prices are reasonable and so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price.   They have a wide menu, and everything is made to order right in front of you with fresh ingredients.   People are nice and friendly.   Unlike many pizza places,  everyone looks nice   Not all the tats and piercing."}
{"text":"Its pretty good. Very tasty and filling. I'd give it 4 stars but,I just wish there was a tad bit more sauce on their pizza's,and a little less doughy."}
{"text":"Everyone has different pizza tastes.  So, even if this is just pretty good, you can't beat the value."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is great. The staff are quick, friendly, and the food is fresh and delicious when baked at home! So happy to have them in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Nice, fast and friendly staff. I love love love their Hawaiian pizza."}
{"text":"I would give NO STARS if I could. My family and I have gotten pizza from here numerous times and it's always been good.. Until last night! We've been sick all night..vomiting and diarrhea. NEVER again!!!"}
{"text":"I love getting my pizza here and taking it home to cook the way I like it (not crisp). I like watching the pizzas being made. 
Tonight Dominique and Cheyenne (please forgive me if I misspelled your names) made my pizza. They greeted me as I came in. Asked which pizza I wanted and made it as if it were for their own family. They didnt slap it together but took time on each pizza they made. Excellent example of great costumer service. Very clean work area. They really take pride in their jobs! Great job ladies! You rock!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So glad to have one in FH. Sauce tastes close to homemade and the pizzas are always great quality. Can't beat their salads either."}
{"text":"I actually have to disagree with the comment from LCDR P.  I typically don't like pizza hut and dominos. I did try papa murphys many many years ago and it was horrible.  So to have one open at the corner of where I live, I was totally willing to give it a try but didn't expect much.  I only went in because they had several coupons that arrived in the mail.  So I went in and ordered a family size pepperoni pizza.  I got it home and baked it in my convection oven (which always bakes better then a regular oven) and to my surprise, it was REALLLLY good.  

A few days later they had their official grand opening specials and I went back again this time to get a sausage, mushroom and onion.  I was kinda caught off guard cause I was offered white onions, or the onion mixture. I was like well what is an onion mixture?  It's white onion, green onions, and red onions. Well hell I'm a huge onion and garlic fan so I went for the mixture.  I also played one of their games for the grand opening and won a card FULL of huge discounted coupons for several styles of pizza.  

I went again 2 days later before their specials ended and got a large 2 topping pizza for only $7 

Then 2 days later they called me telling me I won a family size pizza.

So all in all, let me sum this up.  

Service for this location - Very nice (especially since it was all young teens/kids who usually don't give a crap) I met 2 of the managers and they were very nice too.

Quality & Taste - I honestly really enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying some of their combo type pizzas.

Price - Well this is the only problem I actually have.  I honestly won't ever goto this place and pay full price. I think it's over priced just like every other pizza place.  A typical large pizza should be $5  (little caesars and cici's pizza) Don't mis understand me though. Those 2 places are definitely cheap pizza, but they are decent.   

I think papa murphys is definitely a step above those 2 place but again their prices are high.  However I''ve already noticed that they frequently have coupons and as long as I have a coupon I would DEFINITELY go back.  

I mean come on. $7 for a family size (x-large) pepperoni. YUMMMM

I look forward to being a regular customer at this location."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizzas I have ever had, I have bought frozen for a lot cheaper and tastier, so  you pay 2/4 dollars cheaper than a pizza joint but then you have to use gas or electric to cook it, well there goes the savings...if you have not tried it don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Maybe you should travel to one of the nearby locations.  Staff couldn't care less about a customer.  No greeting no personality by the long haired black girl working.  Not even a thank you."}
{"text":"I have had good service and good food from this location.  last evening the service was so so and then there was a HAIR in the cheese which wasn't found until it was baked.  Called them and the \"manager\" Gustavo comment was, \"it must be the girl who works here because all the rest of us are guys and have short hair\"  He had no solution for the problem.  I asked for an Owner contact and he gives me the number for a Scott 480-510-6920.  A call to his number goes to voicemail and no return call.  This is very poor customer service...."}
{"text":"I had never heard about this place until I moved, and now I get coupons all the time.  And even though I did try it, I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  The pizza was good and the ingredients were very fresh, but isn't the whole point of ordering pizza so you can lay on your couch and be lazy?

Papa Murpy's is of the 'take and bake' variety.  So you can call your order in, and then you go pick up your freshly made, but not baked pizza.  The coupon I had was $6.99 for a one-topping large pizza, so it is a good deal, but for just a bit more, you could go pick up a pizza you don't have to bake from Pizza Hut or somewhere along those lines. 

3 Stars because the pizza was good, but not great.  Minus 2 stars because I am just not sure about the concept.  It seems almost like you're making a frozen pizza, except it's not frozen.  Well anyway, you get the idea.  They sell bagged salad too!"}
{"text":"Better order ahead. Because When i walked in for a take and bake pizza -The manager and two other employees made pizza after pizza for order ahead orders while me and two other customers were made to wait until all the call ahead orders were completed. And with no apology for the wait either. Horrible. Never going back"}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful and positive experience in the store on the 4th of July. The staff warm and friendly, extremely helpful with my dietary restrictions, and generally made my day fantastic. It made my 4th of July the best!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Great service. Not a complaint here."}
{"text":"First time in here... They weren't too busy. The cashier was super personable and advised me Tuesday is $10 for any large pizza. This was great (since it was a better deal than the coupons I had!). They made my pizza quickly and it smells amazing :) I haven't been to a Papa Murphy's in years and I was impressed by the cleanliness of the store, friendliness of the staff and also how quickly my pizza was made. This is a great alternative to regular 'take out' pizza since you get to take ownership on actually 'cooking' a semi home-cooked meal.

I loved the vegetarian gourmet I ordered! Definitely hit the spot! :)"}
{"text":"Extremely sadden by the customer service we just received. A friend and I walked into the store at 7:48... place closes at 8pm... we didn't realize it was that close to closing time so we made sure to apologize to the two workers and even tipped $5 when we paid.
From the moment we entered the store, it was very noticeable that the workers were annoyed. We apologize many times and Matthieu, one of he workers, even made the comment after we apologized, \"yeah... we are only open for 9 more minuets\"
We could even tell that they were complaining about us while they were making our pizzas..... after we tipped them $5 for 2 pizzas!!!!
Super disappointed :(

Update:
Changed to 4 star rating from 1 star because I was very impressed with a gentleman named Ryan that contacted me after I message the business about my experience. He apologized for the experience and horrible customer service I received and notified me that their policy is to keep their doors open 10 minutes past the posted closing time to accommodate late guests. He asked if the district manager could call me to hear about my experience. I spoke with Scott, the DM and was happy that he seemed very concerned about my experience as well. I enjoyed my interaction with both Ryan and Scott very much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great tasting crust and so many varieties to choose from at such great prices. Super easy to prepare fresh pizza at home. So you don't eat pizza because you think it's fattening? Well you have options here that will make you happy to have pizza again... Their thin crust feta cheese and spinach pizza is amazing and so light that you won't feel full and bloated when you're done eating - unless, of course, you eat the whole pie yourself. LOL. 
So glad they're here. This makes pizza night a lot more delicious and affordable. PS The owner in the staff are super friendly as well. Good customer service is hard to find these days. Kudos!"}
{"text":"We just walked out after being inside for 15 minutes and no one acknowledging us. There were 3 associates working, 2 making pizzas and 1 behind the register. We were greeted when we walked in and one guy said we'll be right with you. That guy then walked out. After 10 minutes the girl asked us if the pizzas sitting at the end were ours and we told her \"no, no one has taken our order yet\" and that was it. It was as though we weren't even there. We had two small children with us that were getting impatient from waiting. We are very disappointed"}
{"text":"This is only a temporary review. We stopped on to sit a grab a quick bite to eat while getting our car serviced to our disappointment is was take out only! So we didn't get to eat there. The decor was nice and the store was super clean! Looking forward to trying it out when we are not on the run!"}
{"text":"Very fast and efficient. Awesome customer service. We travel just a little farther to go to this location after bad service at the one closer to us."}
{"text":"I wish I could say the food is good but I have never gotten that far here. I have gone to this location twice and the employees seem to never know what they are doing. I had a coupon for a free pizza. Asked to upgrade the crust and I'd pay. Asked to add an ingredient and I'd pay. The employees seemed confused and said no. They have to do what the coupon says. I have never had that problem at any other location. They were out of salads, they couldn't make me one. Again, other locations jump to help out customers. I feel they we're just lazy"}
{"text":"Veteran owned and operated. My son has food allergies and this is a great option taste and $ wise for him to indulge his love for pizza! They always remember us- gluten free crust with no cheese :) I am thankful for their kindness (ALWAYS), great service and delicious pizza. We love you guys!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Papa Murphy's in town! And it all starts with the costumer service and management. Every time I go in, I'm greeted with smiling faces, great attitudes, and a clean shop. I stop by after work to pick up a couple pizzas to take home for the family and it's always quick and accurate. It's so convenient and the family loves pizza night because we get to make it bake it ourselves!"}
{"text":"First time today and I must say not bad.  First off great customer service.  Pretty simple if you know how to read for the instructions.  Oh yeah and the cinnamon wheel oooooEe"}
{"text":"I like the fact that i can walk in and order a pizza that i like the way i want it and with all the fresh toppings that they have it was cool to see them prepare it. Every pizza topping was measured precisely and took it home to bake and within 20 min i had a fresh pizza. the only downside is it isnt something thats going to WOW you its pretty basic. 

Angus Steak n Garlic Thin Crust (4/5)- This pizza was actually pretty Delish!! They Put steak cheesefresh garlic and green onions on top. Great Flavor I reccomend this pizza to anyone.

Half Pepperoni/ Half Hawaiian regular crust(2/5)- This pizza really sucked i did not enjoy it at all i think the pizza dough just didnt do it for me. Its hard to go wrong with classics but i think if i got it deep dish or thin it would be better.

Overall this place has its ups and downs. The good thing is its better than going to the supermarket and getting a pie. But the bad thing is you can get a Pizza Hut pizza for just about the same price and you know its going to be they way you expect it. Also its a little pricey for a take home pizza but i will be back for that Steak and Garlic. Yum"}
{"text":"I came into this location late one night because my husband and I did not feel like actually cooking, we have had great experiences prior to this one...
When I walked into the store there was some awful rap music blasting incredibly loud.. This normally would not bother me except for every other word in this music was N* or B*.. Among the other cuss words that were thrown about... Very untasteful.
I can understand after the doors are closed and locked but during business hours when any customer can walk in?
All I wanted to order was a large sausage pizza, they already have those ready to go.. The process was fast and easy... A little rushed but I can't blame them for that; it was an hour before close."}
{"text":"I went in as I got some coupons in the mail.  I added a cheese bread on, and the girl asked her manager for help on applying the coupon.  He came out and very rudely advised that the coupon isn't combineable with other offers.  Apparently ordering anything else off the regular menu nullifies their coupons.  The pizza was okay, but I found the dough to be quite yeasty.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pizzas from here are pretty good! I mean it's nothing to write home about in my opinion. But there is always some kind of deal, so why not. This particular location was nice, clean, and we had good quick service!"}
{"text":"My family just moved to the area and this Papa Murphy's is the best one we've ever been to. I usually don't bother writing reviews for chains, but the experience I had here was so positive, I feel like I have to.

The staff was super friendly and informed us of current promotions and upcoming ones as well. Our pizza was prepared promptly after we ordered and it ended up looking picture perfect. At our old location they didn't do much for toppings, so to see a pizza filled perfectly with them was such a great surprise.

Service and pizza was great, I am looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"There was a Groupon for Papa Murphys so we thought we would try it. I'm glad I only paid $10. I've had better frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a family size Garden Veggie and subbed toppings.  It looks wonderful and really was the best tasting pizza that I have tried out.  The woman who assisted me was really cool and even suggested I text to be in their phone club.  For $11, I got a family size pizza and a cookie dough with coupon.  Don't forget to tip them for their work."}
{"text":"I am so happy Papa Murphy's is in Vegas! I'm from Oregon and grew up on this stuff. Fresh ingredients, fresh dough, cooked at home so it's perfectly hot and ready to eat. No more lukewarm delivery pizzas for me! 

The staff at this store is extra friendly and helpful. Quick too! But if you are too impatient to wait the 4 mins it takes them to make your pizza, you can call ahead or order online and they'll have it ready for pickup. You really have no excuse for not making this your #1 pizza choice. 

Thank you Papa Murphy's for bringing a little slice of home to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Since my first review, we've gotten Papa Murphy's two more times, and each time has been amazing.

I loved the Cowboy, the first time we had that. 

We've also had the Chicken, bacon, artichoke thin crust, which was absolutely wonderful.

Yesterday, we tried the Chicago stuffed pizza...oh my god, it was SO good.
The pizza is huge.  I'm going to add pictures so you can see just how enormous this thing is. 

Great value for the money...I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Great customer service ! I have to practice on baking the pizza. Couldn't get the crust to be crispy !"}
{"text":"Thanks to Jennifer H. I totally love the Smores pizza?!  That's right pizza with dessert.  Its dinner and desert all at once.  If I could justify it, breakfast :) 

Never would of tried this place, but with Jens help I am a fan.  Thanks, Jen! Yes the kids did get some BTW.  I left them a slice to share.  

I also did enjoy the ham and pineapple pizza good pizza as well.  Time to put this place on your radar next time you are looking for a pizza fix."}
{"text":"Out of dough on a Friday night at 5 pm?  Yikes!  Seems like it might be a tiny problem when you're in the pizza biz.  I wanted one of the Faves, and was told they were out.  I asked if I could wait...Nope, out of dough.

UPDATE:. Erik, the owner, reached out to me on Yelp to apologize, so I'll give this biz a big thumbs up for customer service.  I'll be back to give it another try.

By the way, these take and bake pizzas are crazy good on a pellet grill / smoker.  It's like wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"This place was built by my house and when hubby and I went to try it we loved it! We were one of those first time customers that was confused when we got to the end of the line and given a uncooked pizza haha. We took it home baked it and it was AMAZING."}
{"text":"These guys n gals are ALWAYS freindly and fast.And the prices are fair.When my family and I decide to take a break from our raw food diet and eat out....9outta 10 times its we decide to eat in with Papa Murphys.Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Papa Murphy's yet, let me give you a piece of advice. This establishment closes at 8p, customer service stops at about 645p. That's what my husband I experienced any way when we interacted with Anahi. Apparently, we interrupted her pizza prepping time with our pestering her with a simple question and our order. For a place that hasn't been open for very long, get your act together Anahi; get a smile on your face there's no need to mean mug me. All you have to do is take my order."}
{"text":"I have never ordered from Papa Murphy's in my whole life! Sure, I've had the pizza before but I refused to order from Papa Murphy's myself because I didn't see the point in getting a pizza I would have to cook myself. Welp, a new location opened up in the Aliante Smith's shopping center and they were offering a one-topping large pizza for $6 as a grand opening special. Since I'm NEVER in the mood to make dinner, I decided to finally give Papa Murphy's a whirl.

I called my order in and was told I could pick it up in 10 minutes, which was surprising because it was a weekend evening. When I waltzed in, one of the employees chatted me up about the Neon Museum shirt I was wearing - sweet, the employees are friendly. There wasn't any wait time since I was the only customer there, so I was in and out.

The pizza took around 10-15 minutes to cook and I managed to not burn it. Yay me! My cheese and mushroom pizza was dense and tasted pretty good. It's too much for two people, but hey we got leftovers out of it. ;) Papa Murphy's is a solid pizza chain, and they are always pumping out coupons and deals. Like Arnold, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can't decide if I like this place or not. The pizza is ok...I have to cook it myself....which can be nice, or can totally suck. 

If what you want is to grab a pizza for the babysitter to pop in the oven later, or just to grab a dinner to another night maybe- then this place is great...if you want to feed a crowd...not the place to go."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is in a busy section of town where a lot of after-work folks pick up a take and bake to take home to families on their way home.  Because of this it is best to not assume this is a fast process.  Either call ahead, or better yet use their online ordering option to save time.

In the end it's decent bulk food with more versatility than the grocery store take and bake pies.  If you want something that's better than a fast food pizza there are plenty of other places in Madison that are better, but they also cost a lot more."}
{"text":"The service I received was phenomenal! The young man who helped me went over options, giving me visuals of everything and was very accommodating. I went in during lunch hour, and was surprised that I was the only one there at the moment. Café Rio next door was packed and the service was sloppy and slow. I had a much better experience at Papa Murphy's and recommend it for anybody who has the option to take the pizza back home or to the office to be baked."}
{"text":"I was super skeptical about having to cook my own pizza.  Upon first entry I thought  this is just a glorified dominoes where i can see them make my pizza but i have to cook the damn thing.  We got the Stuffed Crust Pizza which consequently produced enough leftovers fir three days.  When they were making the pizza i was completely shocked with how much was on this thing for the price.  I felt like money well so far.  Then i thought with my shitty oven there is no way this thing will be anything but soggy.  Fortunately I was dead wrong.  The thing came out crispy and amazing.  Fresh hot and melted in our mouths.  Everyone enjoyed.  We got the smores pizza also and cooked that the next day because we just had too much food for less than $20.  I will not be ordering delivery again.  Not to mention the prices.  Comparable rosatis  would have easily been twice the price."}
{"text":"I figured out why this location does not have as many stars as the others customer service they should be thankful that their Pizza is pretty decent because their approach is not"}
{"text":"Great service. The employees there were super nice and very professional. The pizza is always a great value and of course it tastes really good. Get the bacon chicken artichoke pizza it's amazing."}
{"text":"Laura was so helpful and cheerful. It's a very clean place and I am super excited to take my 20.00 lunch of Chicago Deep dish, salad and a S'more dessert pizza and yes it was 20 bucks and there is more than enough for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"One of the best stores in the chain. I used several of them in Cali before moving out here but these employees are the best of them all. They are all super friendly and helpful when you have issues with your order. I ordered online and it didn't take my coupon, told the staff inside and they helped me right there. Guess the website ordering has many issues (corporates fault) - not sure if this a franchise, but they are amazing at this location."}
{"text":"I gave this four stars because I believe in the brand. The Veggie pizza I got had almost zero cheese on it? The prices seem a bit high compared to past experience with this franchise. Growing pains will happen with any new business and I hope they figure theirs out. The concept is a good one, especially if it is a bit cheaper than ordering a ready made pie."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome, very engaging and friendly.  The pizzas however are simply gross.  The sauce has no taste (their standard marinara) and the cheese is cheap and gets rubbery when it cools off.  Its a great concept, I just wish the ingredients were better.  If I'm doing a take an bake I'll just get a HomeRun Inn pizza from Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"Very good pizza....so much fresher than the chains. Service is quick and friendly. Now if they just had online ordering..."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location VERY regularly for several years.  I like the concept of paying half the price the other places charge and getting a better pizza.  Is it perfect?  No but for sheer quantity of ingredients it's not bad.  There is seldom a line (good for me, bad for the franchise owner) and the workers are okay, with some being a cut above.

The cost of buying a pizza is ridiculous at virtually all pizzarias, the ingredients cost a couple dollars at most, and to charge $20 is robbery.  Proving that last night I bought an extra-large blank crust at WinCo, lots of pepperoni, cheese, mushrooms, onion and sauce and the whole thing cost under $4 for a fresh made-from-scratch pizza.

Over time they have cut their menu to just the basics.  They used to have great take-and-bake lasagne, fresh salads and a premium pizza with spicier sauce and pepperoni.  However kudos to them that the price for the remaining pizzas has stayed pretty much the same.

I don't think the franchise owner (or maybe it's the company) is very creative or aggressive.  This location \"owns\" a very large residential area and could do much better than they do.  My 3.5 star rating gets an extra half point because it's convenient, cheap and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"After 18 years of buying raw uncooked pizzas from Papa Murphy's why did I ban them forever from my pizza list? What changed to take them from 5-stars to 0-stars for me? Note that this only applies to the Union Hills/32nd Street store which single handedly lost my business for the whole company.

I used to like coming here. The employees were friendly and they actually had an on-site manager who remembered me from visit to visit. These days I never see the same face twice and no hint of a manager.

Recently they had a price increase, not a small one but large enough that it was ridiculous to pay that much for a hunk of raw dough that I had to cook myself. Enough that I could buy a real pizza from a real pizzeria professionally baked in a real wood-fired pizza oven for the same or even less.

Then they started getting shady and hiding some of their prices that used to be on the menu board. Now it's whatever the newbie employee of the day thinks he can get out of you.

The final straw was when I walked in for a pickup after preordering a pizza online from their location's website that was on advertised sale. All 4 guys at the counter denied knowing anything about it and refused to honor the price. I don't blame them, they are only underpaid minimum wage kids, I blame the franchise owner for neglecting to train them properly.

And sticking to that subject, Papa Murphy's is a billion dollar business but right on their receipts they warn you that from now on they are going to make YOU pay a \"Premium Upcharge\" on an already overpriced raw pizza to \"help\" them pay a minimum wage! Seriously?

Let me correct something, the final straw wasn't overcharging me for something that I have screenshots of being on sale at their store. The final straw was when I contacted Papa Murphy's headquarters to let them know what happened and they wouldn't even acknowledge I exist. They ignored me thinking what difference does one cheated customer make. Okay Papa Murphy's, no it's YOU who don't exist. Your company is dead to me from now on."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza spot.  You pick how you want it and they wrap it up.  Take it home and toss in the oven (comes with its own baking pan) and dinner will be hot out of the oven."}
{"text":"Very friendly and great value for the price!  Will definitely be back.  The employee on duty was extremely friendly and helped me make a decision on what pizza to order.  I went with a Thai chicken which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Aweful customer service. Im only giving a 2 because the cashier was very friendly. Ill never go back here and sad to see this is veteran owned and operated because i myself am a veteran and my best friend and i were treated like garbage by a Caucasian man with eye glasses. My friend accidentally forgot her new card at home and couldn't figure out why her card kep/t declining. So the sweet cashier offered to run it as credit and than the man with glasses snapped at the cashier \"not to run it because it wouldn't read any different\"  so i paid for the food and my best friend left in tears after being humiliated in front of 2 other employees. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Love the option of fresh take n bake pizza. Grew up with glad to see one in Las Vegas! They are the best pizzas! So many options for such a great price!"}
{"text":"I just had the most buzzard experience ever. I live near this Papa Murphy's and always see the sign so I decided to give it a try. I called and asked for a Cheese Pizza. They asked for my name and phone number and I went to pick it up about 10 min later. I get there and there is a uncooked pizza on the table. I asked the lady this is not my pizza right? She says yes, we are a take and bake. I'm respond, nobody told me. She says oh we don't have to tell you that's how we are. I say I have hungry ppl and I don't want to have to bake this myself. She gets mad and says that's rude. At this point I just walk away and tell her you need to inform ppl on the phone as you have a different concept and many people don't know. Unbeliaveble.  Papa Murphy's management. Freaking include as part if your phone etiquette. We are a take and bake pizza how may I help you. Not that hard to do so. I'm so mad I shouldn't even give you this business tip. I will never ever ever be back there or any papa Murphy's ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"We placed a phone order and picked up from this location a few weekends ago. We ordered the Chicken Bacon Artichoke pizza, the Cowboy pizza, and a salad. I love their pizza. Always have and always will. The salad appeared to be wilted and somewhat frozen so they may need to adjust the temperature of the fridge. They also would not accept a coupon via mobile device. Instead we had to print one out and bring it in which is not a huge deal but I think they should look into becoming more tech friendly. Overall would return to this location but would not order a salad again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place - great food, pleasant staff; however, yesterday I had a very disappointing experience. I purchased a pizza (very good) and a salad (not very good). The salad lettuce turned brown and I don't care for stale salads. I called them and the next day (today) I returned the salad and told them we could not eat salad with our dinner last night. Quite irritating to have to return the salad and not have it for dinner. The employee handed us a new salad. No offer of refund, no offer for anything to compensate us for our inconvenience or their error. The gentleman at the counter said if I give you a free salad, I would get fired. Interesting - I don't believe it. When I mentioned common sense, I felt like I was talking to a wall.  His blank attitude made me think that he's so glad to get me out of that store. He won't have to worry. I'm gone."}
{"text":"Well I hate to do it because I don't usually rate restaurants, however it came to the point that this needs to be put out.
Me and my wife got pizza and there was a hair baked into the crust. I wish I could upload video but I will definitely upload a photo.

Mistakes happen and I understand that but when you were treated rudely by the manager that's where the problem lies. The manager does not care that there is hair in the pizza, she refunded my money and thought that was adequate. 

They told me I could have 50% off the next Pizza, like I was actually the one at fault. I don't know if anybody's ever picked up a pizza crust buy a baked in hair but it's disgusting and deserves minimum a $20 credit.

Especially in the day of age of Technology where Yelp and other social media apps are so prevalent.

Readers of this review, please do me the favor and don't give this lousy establishment any of your business unless you want rude management and hair baked in your pizza. Let me tell you one thing if there's hair in the pizza crust there's probably a lot of other disgusting things that we are missing."}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a great first experience... I phone ordered and my two large pizzas were ready in ten minutes! The directions were on the pizza and verbally explained to me in an efficient manner. Both employees were extremely polite as well. But most of all OH...MY.. GOSH! The chicken bacon artichoke thin crust pizza is insanely good and now my absolute favorite pizza ever!!! I highly recommend it, and I can't wait to return to papa murphy's and try others!"}
{"text":"I am a relatively new customer to Papa Murphy's take out pizza. I recently moved to Sun City. My neighbors across the street brought two HUGE slices of pizza to our home. Later, the lady told me the pizza was from Papa Murphy's, that it was made fresh in their place of business, and you took it home and baked it yourself. 

So, my husband and I went there about two nights later. Got the pizza and brought it home to cook it. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!! Who knew that I could cook a pizza and have it looking SO GOOD?

We are Papa Murphy's converts now! Never again will I order another pizza to be delivered. Those pizzas were too greasy, but that's just all there was, or so I thought. A Papa Murphy's Pizza is really good, just what you would expect from a high-end pizzeria. But it came from my kitchen!"}
{"text":"Never been to this kind of pizza place before, but I would like to recommend it. The workers are fast and friendly. They helped us decide on the pizza and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Purchased a pizza here today for dinner. Was surprised you cook the pizza on the paper plate provided but to my delight the crust was perfect and the pizza very fresh. Well worth trying this concept of purchasing a fresh pizza and cook at home."}
{"text":"Came into this location as our first time ever to Papa Murphy's as we were given a coupon for a free large 1-topping pizza. We heard good things and were excited to try. We proceeded to give the lady our coupon and she told us that the coupon is not valid at that location, mind you there were no location limitations outlined anywhere on the coupon. 

My biggest issue was her attitude about it, very condescending. She claimed that the manager would give those types of coupons and that she is the manager and does NOT give those out! She could've handled things differently and maybe sell up the pizza, we may have just bought it, but if she really is the manager, then she has no business working with customers and especially being the manager. 

We almost didn't even attempt a different location, but we did. We went to the 7325 S. Rainbow location and it was a completely different experience. That crew is stellar, especially the manager! Making people want to come back, THAT'S how you provide great customer service."}
{"text":"I admit I was skeptical of tyring this place. I was pleasantly suprised.

Love the fact they have provolone cheese for the pizza.  Reminds me of my favorite pizza place Imo's back in STL.  It's the Subway of pizza as well which I thought was cool and different picking your topping etc..

We tried a thin crust as well as a thick crust pizza.  We thought the thin was much better than the thick.  I'm sure it was the oven but the cooking times we off.  Had to cook a few minutes longer than the package said.

When I am not being a complete lazy bum and want pizza I will visit again.  For those hangover days when I need a pizza to survive I will still be ordering Rosati's.  this place is way way way better than Pizza Hut and Domino's."}
{"text":"An interesting idea, and one not otherwise done.....they create the pizza but you take it home and bake it.  You have to look at their website for a while before you actually figure that out.

So...the pizza....is pretty good (I got thin crust; I'm from Chicago and there is not much to compare a Chicago stuffed pizza to Papa Murphy's).  

The pricing leaves a bit to be desired, considering they don't have to buy a giant oven and run it all day, and they don't have to pay insurance premiums commensurate with having a giant oven etc.  They charge pizza parlor prices for what is essentially an un-frozen frozen pizza.

The service....they have infused their customer service standards with the new robotic \"welcome\" uttered by the staff when you walk in the door.  Since I had never been there before, I didn't know where to go to pickup my ordered ahead pizzas.  So I stood there.  And stood there.  And stood there.  Several minutes went by.  I could have been naked and they would not have noticed.  I could have been on fire but they might have noticed the increase in the air temperature, since they don't have the oven heating the place up.  And waited.  Finally, another patron came in and marched up to a counter and told them she had ordered ahead.  That's how I figured out where to go.  Did I mention that their signage is not all that great?  I can read, if there's a sign there to read, but there wasn't.  So I would rate their service somewhere between \"indifferent\" and \"neglectful.\"

Maybe I should rate them a 2.  A 2 1/2 would be perfect.  \"Sometimes a girl just needs a half.\"  But since their pizza is pretty good, I'll leave them at a 3."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff and great prices. They always have a meal deal going on to save a little money. Every time I come here I am greeted as soon as I walk into the door."}
{"text":"Not sure why people have trouble baking the crust, I've ordered from Papa Murphys a couple dozen times and the crust always turns out great. I like it a bit crispy so I cook the last 3-5 minutes off the cardboard plate and it turns out perfect!"}
{"text":"Certainly the best take and bake  Pizza around. We love the ingredients and the thin crust is a healthy option as well. Friendly staff as always. I like it better than any of the other pizza joints around with the exception of Spinatos."}
{"text":"Do not patronize this papa murphys. The customer service was terrible. The guy working at the counter was beyond rude. I ordered my pizza online and was given a 25 minute wait time. When I arrived to pick it up the pizza was still not ready and had to wait an additional 10min, he was working on my pizza and literally stopped working on it and started working on the customers behind me pizzas. I asked him when mine would be ready and was yelled at by him. He said he had walk in customers even though I had put in my order almost 45 min prior at that point. Now he was working by himself but the owners/managers need to get their act together and hire friendly staff who can make fast efficient customer service a priority, cause it is papa Murphys meaning that the ingredients are the same everywhere you go."}
{"text":"Visited my local Papa Murphy's on Saturday and asked if they had any deals going. They didn't but the owner was there making some salads. She offered me a pizza that was going to be available the following week. She was going to take it home to have her husband try it out. Not only did she offer it to me, but she gave me a really great deal on it. Wow, that was a really great thing to do, and very appreciated...because that pizza was delicious!!  Thanks so much for the friendly service."}
{"text":"Main points:
-Decent fast food pizza 
-Variety of toppings, unique topping combinations
-Comparable pricing to other fast food chains

Review:
It's like Subway for pizza, you go in and order a preset combination of toppings or pick your own toppings, watch them make it for you with their fresh ingredients, and take it home (although they don't cook it for you, you'll do that at home with the instructions).

I've tried Papa Murphy's at a few small get-togethers, and overall for fast food pizza it's pretty good.  I wasn't too sure I liked the idea of having to bake my own pizza, but it actually works out well when you need to pick up food early to serve later (ex: book clubs, play-dates, casual weeknight dinners, etc.)  

The main reason I like them is because they have interesting and unique topping combinations including \"Hamburger\" (with pickles on it!), \"Cowboy\", and their Gourmet Veggie (white garlic sauce instead of red sauce on base) which is my favorite, and I'm not even a vegetarian!  They also offer dessert pizzas such as s'mores and cinnamon, which are pretty good too.

If you're looking for something fast and casual, give Papa Murphy's a shot.  With their regular coupons and Tuesday night \"any large for $10\" deal, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice and put together a quality veggie pizza for me very fast. Better than frozen and most delivery. Take this over Pizza Hut or dominoes any day!"}
{"text":"if you cook these right,,, they are equivalent to NYPD for a lot less , specially the coupons and specials...

BUT --- PLEASE bring back the bacon cheeseburger pizza !!! that thing was awesome, got 4 of my close friends hooked on it only to find out it was a temp promotional item.. The flavors were amazing... If you had the bacon cheeseburger still on the menu, def 4 stars... please don't tease us again :-("}
{"text":"Good pizza and great deals. Recommend going on Tuesday for the awesome deals they have. Also always get the desert pizzas they are the real deal"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. If I could give negotiable stars I would. Walked in and received blank stares from the three employees. Stood there and none of them greeted me or even attempted to provide SOME kind of service. Helpful tip, if you are a employee and a customer walks in... at least say hello... not hard, kiddos! Then my pizza I ordered on the phone and was quoted ten minutes wasnt even started so I had to wait (what's the point of calling it in then?) then was asked \"what did you order?\" I told them to confirm on the ticket since my husband called the pizza in and received a huge huff and a eye roll like how dare I ask them to do their job. and when it was ready, I asked for the salad I ordered and was told \"pull it out of the drive yourself.\" Gee thanks for the great experience. We don't be back."}
{"text":"The man with glasses carefully measured the ingredients to make certain it was the proper amount. Then he placed half of them on the pizza and the other half on the floor. He didn't seem to mind so I will not be a returning customer. Choose a different location for Papa Murphy's."}
{"text":"This location is normally pretty good. I love that I can take it home and bake it when it is most convenient. The garlic sauce is amazing. I like that I can customize my own pizza. Everyone should definitely try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Who'd have thought take n' bake would be so good? Very friendly staff and they deliver a great tasting product.

My only problem with Papa Murphy's is they take food stamp cards. I hate paying full price for my pizza and someone else's."}
{"text":"Been to this PM twice and been happy thus far. Everything tastes fresh and we're definite fans of the thin crust style pizza. If you haven't tried the \"take & bake\" I suggest giving it a shot, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Papa Murphy's has a stamp card and you get a free pizza after 10 visits, I believe. Don't forget to ask for one! ;)"}
{"text":"Man I am so bummed about doing this.... But I have to. This rating got two stars because even though the girl helping us was nice, she had no clue what the hell was going on. I called prior to coming down to see if they had the heart pizza yet. She tells me um I think they start in valentines day. (Um that makes no sense) so whatever, we go down to get a pepperoni pizza. We order and then she takes the guys behind us, order. That's when I notice the sign, heart pizza with free cookie dough. So I ask her. She's like oh I have no clue when it starts. (Face palm). So she offers to call and ask the manager, I said no don't worry about it cause I didn't want the guys behind us to get stuck waiting. So at the end she calls the manager, come to find out the were offering the heart pizza. Needless to say. Annoyed. Buiuuuut she was super nice. (Hence the two stars.) I won't say much about the quality of pizza, you can see for yourself by the pictures. Let's just say I will NEVER be back. I will say the hair in the pizza was a free add on, luckily they didn't charge me for that."}
{"text":"Wow! Great service. Walked and was immediately (and warmly) greeted by the nice woman at the register. I ordered a large Papa's Favorite. It only took a few minutes for my pizza to be ready. The man who made the pizzas was extremely nice, too! 

Got home and just had a few slices - it's really delicious pizza. You can't beat it for the price. And $10 Tuesdays?! Score! I'll DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Always loved papa murphys and now I love them even more with the addition of sun dried tomatos. I'm pretty basic with my pizza usually just cheese cause it's rare to find sun dried tomatos. So I am really happy to have another reason to never eat frozen pizza unless papa murphys is closed."}
{"text":"I love papa Murphy's the flavors in the pizza are always so fresh and delicious and the combinations are healthy and great tasting i totally recommend it."}
{"text":"So i am sort of a snob when it comes to pizza. I'm guilty of judging places because I am not a fan of pizza Hut and other like places but I recently got some coupons in the mail for Papa Murphy's and decided what the heck, I will give it a shot. I called in before I left work and they were ready for pick up when I got over there. i got a specialty stuffed one for my boo and got myself a veggie thin crust and even got some free cookie dough!! The gentleman that helped me on the phone and when i went it was very helpful and make my first experience just delightful. It was a nice change just to get home and throw something in the oven and have dinner be done. The pizzas came out better than I expected and my boyfriend even said the next morning that his pizza was really good and would def order from Papa M's again. That comment coming from him says a lot, since he is a bigger pizza snob then I am!

Super convenient, super tasty, super affordable.

SCORE X3 !"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite pizza place in Indian Trail! They have the freshest ingredients I think of all the major chains. But the thing that really sets it apart is the quick and friendly service I get at this location. It's very clean and you can tell the owners take pride in their business.

I had the all meat pizza the other day, I would highly recommend it. Whatever you pie of choice, give them a try on your next pizza order."}
{"text":"We love Papa Murphy's! Good pizza at a fair price. I also love how quickly our order is ready. We eat here at least once a week and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So awesome! At first I was like, I don't feel like baking my pizza...and we almost went somewhere else. Then I decided how much fresher Papa murphy's (I really want to call it Papa Smurf's) would be.

There were a bunch of people in there and our pizza was put together fast and it was not sloppy at all. It was perfect. The employees were very helpful and nice. 

So glad we found this spot, thanks to Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"Always have loved Papa Murphy's. They give you plenty of toppings unlike other places. 

Tip: if you want a crispier crust, take the pizza off the tray (directly on the rack) for the last 3-5 minutes. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Never really seen a Papa Murphy's before moving to Surprise.  There were a few in San Diego, but none real close to my house, and I never really had a desire to try them out.  I've been here for 2 years and still never made it to this one here in Surprise.  My buddy Kevin just moved to town, and asked me if I had ever been.  This place is right up the street from his new house, and they have a flyer out that advertises \"Any Large Pizza for $10.00 on Tuesdays\".  Sounded like a good deal, and it planted a seed in my brain.  I needed to try this joint out.  Always wanted to, not sure why I never did.  Tonight was the night.  Drove down, parked, and walked inside.

When I got in there, 3 people greeted me right away and were very eager to help me out.  I told them that I had never been to a Papa Murphy's before and they all smiled and looked at each other.  It was a little bit awkward, but they were super friendly after that first initial interaction.  The guy explained how everything worked, all the sizes, costs etc.  I decided to do a create my own pizza on their original crust.  I went with red sauce, pepperoni and garlic (our usual go to order at most pizza places).  You pay, they make your pizza, explain how to cook it,  and you are out the door in less than 5 minutes.  Here is how it was..........

Large Pepperoni and Garlic Pizza-  Their are instructions included in the pizza.  The pizza comes on this giant paper plate looking thing.  The instructions are to bake it on the paper tray, for about 10 minutes, then check on it every 2 minutes after that.  For a \"crisp crust\" they recommend you take it off the paper plate and put it directly on the oven rack after 10 minutes.  We did that, but I would recommend removing that paper plate maybe 5 minutes in and have it cook directly on the oven rack for the remaining 12-15 minutes.  The only complaint about this pizza was that the bottom dough was just a tad underdone once the cheese and crust on top were ready.  Do that trick, and you are in for a treat!  

I am usually a pizza snob, and only like certain types of pizza from certain places.  I tend to eat at the same spots over and over once I find something good.  I took a bite into this pizza, and was incredibly surprised at how good it was!  It reminded me of my own home made pizzas that I do, but theirs was a little bit better!  The cheese melted perfectly, the pepperonis were nice and crisp as well as a little spicy, there was plenty of chopped garlic, and the sauce was very tasty, too!  The crust wasn't the most flavorful, and that bottom was just a tad underdone, but for the most part, this pizza was really good.  Way better than any chain like Pizza Hut, Little Ceasars, Papa Johns, Dominos etc.  I would choose to pick up a pizza here over those other places 99 out of 100 times!  Think of it as a little more expensive frozen pizza you can get at the store, but 1,000,000 times tastier.  It was a mighty fine pizza.  I was impressed!  

Overall, I was surprised at how much I liked it!  It's super quick, inexpensive (Especially on Tuesdays...any Large Pizza is only $10.00) and pretty darn tasty after all is said and done.  The employees were nice, they have deals online, twitter etc. and it's pretty close to the house.  Can't wait to try out their other pizzas.  If they are as close to as good as the one I had tonight, I will be happy and continue to come back!"}
{"text":"My family and I love their pizza. The pizza is delicious and always consistent! The staff is always friendly! Papa Murphy's is our go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Always amazing pizza for a great deal.  They even opened early for me to pick up my pizza.  They're so accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the first person to review this place.  They must have been around now for close to three years now and they have decent pizza, dirt cheap!  (And they always have coupons to top it off.)  It all goes back to relative value and I'll use a Taco Bell taco as an example.  For 59 cents, it's a pretty good taco but if you paid $5.00, it wouldn't be as good.  If you're spending $5.00 on a taco, you want it to be phenomenal, but if it's only 59 cents, your standards are lower.  Now at Papa Murphy's you can walk out with a large pepperoni pizza for $6.99 (and when I say large, I really mean large - much bigger than other pizza places larges) and it's nearly as good (if others are a \"5\", I give it a \"4 1/2\") but it's only $6.99!  So for it being a good pizza and only being $6.99 it turns into an excellent pizza.  Relative value!  Get it?  You can go now.  School is out."}
{"text":"I use to be a regular patron many years ago in WA state.

My son wanted to try this for his birthday.  We purchased the family size Chicken with white sauce.  The entire family loved it and for Tuesday night special, it was easy on the wallet.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Drive the extra 15 minutes to the location on N. Durango.  This location doesn't follow special requests and charges you extra for the mistakes they make by not listening.  The person making my pizza clearly told the cashier she put 4 ounces of cheese on the pizza and when she put the additional two ounces on the pizza the cashier charged me for extra cheese.  It's not a huge deal in the overall scheme of things, but when I asked about the charge the cashier said it was because I asked for the rest of the cheese to be put on.  The ingredients were eyeballed and no measured and the pizza was not the quality I am accustomed to getting at be N. Durango location.  I am disappointed.

I go for delicious pizza, not comments about how odd my order is..."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by the excellent customer service at this location. It had been many years and many miles away since I've visited a Papa Murphy's... I have always enjoyed take and bake but the customer service I got here today is what will bring me back again and again. Great job! You guys are doing things right!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for this pizza. The sauce is gross and the crust taste like Bisquik.  It's also kind of on the expensive side for having to take it home and bake it yourself.  I would rather pay the same price for an already cooked pizza.  The cinnamon dessert was good though.  I will not be going back.  This pizza hurt my stomach.  I will stay with RKidds down the street."}
{"text":"Tonight I went into this location with my father and we are absolutely appalled. As frequent customers, we were under the impression that we would walk in and get the exceptional service we usually do; this was not the case. Not only were we ignored by the two ill-tempered, eye rolling employees, we walked into a filthy unattended lobby. After repeating our order multiple times to the absent-minded cashier, she still managed to enter it incorrectly. Once our pizza was in the process of being made, my father had to stop the other employee to verify his order. After multiple scoffs and dirty looks, my father had to pay a separate time to fix their mistake. Instead of apologizing for the miscommunication, the cashier rolled her eyes once more and walked off annoyed. Now that our CORRECT pizza was finally being made, I noticed that the employee in charge of creating these \"masterpieces\" didn't change her gloves she used for condensing Cambros full of raw meats. Violating a direct Food Safety and Environmental Services law especially in front of customers is not only repulsive, but a rational reason for me, a former manager in the food industry, not to return."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's Take 'n' Bake Pizza! Just call in order it up it's ready by the time I get there and they combine stamp cards because I tend to forget mine on the fridge... The pizza is so good ! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"You'll will be mad at yourself if you don't try Papa Murphy's. It is a Take-N-Bake pizza VERY resaonably priced pizza.  Cooked at home so it is nice and fresh, both thin crust and regular crust are excellent. To me the pizza looks health but it was more fun for me putting my fresh toppings at home."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. I just didn't know that I have to bake the pizza myself. Awkward! I will goback for another pizza for sure."}
{"text":"I love pizza!!!  But for some reason P.M. Is just not for me. my family loves it so naturally I'll eat it. I have not experienced anything bad from this place but I guess it just depends on the persons taste buds. Good enough to eat but definitely not my top choice."}
{"text":"I go to this location quite often, it's great to call ahead pick up on the way home and bake when ur ready for dinner.  Service is always great, even when i add and subtract all kinds of stuff.  But man oh man the smores pizza is delish!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great as usual, dough seemed to thick to bake properly in the times that they gave but was yummy over all.
SERVICE SUCKED
Lady asked in front of me asked for Managers phone number, he said they are out of town.  She stated again I didn't ask where they were but their number to call them, after a few min he came up with the phone number but god only knows if it was correct.  I do plan on contacting the store, he was out and out rude.  I asked for their breadsticks, he said we're out; I find it hard to believe they couldn't sprinkle some garlic on the crust for me.  
Sadly this is the closest one to us, and it's already a distance away.  Hopefully his job will go to someone who wants and needs it."}
{"text":"When we were driving around Goodyear to see if we wanted to move here my husband spotted this Papa Murphy's and decided right then and there that this was the place to be lol. Last night we decided to give it a try and were delighted to find the good ol pizza we are used to plus a few new ones at the same great price. Since we have tend to have pizza about once a week I am sure we will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Seriously the friendliest staff of any pizza joint I've ever been in! Papa Murphy's is an interesting concept. They make everything fresh for you, then you take it home and bake it. You can call up, order in advance and have it ready to pick up on the way home. Then you bake it when your family gets home (about 15-18 minutes in the oven) and voila! Hot pizza.

This is a handy place to have in the neighborhood when you have events going on. Like during the holidays. Just order a couple pizzas and stick them in your fridge until you're ready to eat. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the freshness. 

They do have desserts as well. Choose from chocolate chip cookie dough, a smores-type pizza or (what I had) the cinnamon-swirl pie. It's almost like a cinnamon bun, frosting and all, shaped like a pizza. These desserts are also freshly made and ready for you to bake at home.

Oh they do have a punch card available too. I think it's buy five pizzas and get one free. Make sure you ask for it if they don't automatically give it to you."}
{"text":"Love to pick up a Gourmet Delite Pizza like the Herb Mediterranean Chicken when I don't want to cook. No muss no fuss! The thin crust comes out thin and crispy. The tasty out of the ordinary pizza toppings add just the punch I need. Love $10 Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I always get the same pizza.. why change such a good thing?  The Cowboy baby!  We order this pizza in a large and the pizza must weigh 5 pounds!  Everything is always fresh.  Fresh chopped veggies, fresh, fresh, fresh!  Everyone is always friendly and nice, pizza prices are great!  I love the fact you call your pizza in, you pick it up, get it home and cook it whenever you please.  I do like to let the pizza cook off the pan for the last 10 minutes for a crispier crust.  The 1st bite is always an eye to eye contact with my husband and I on how satisfying the flavors are!  Love this location!!!"}
{"text":"Place has great customer service and they always make it easy. I was shocked at first when I found out I had to cook it myself lol. But it's fast and easy and tastes great. Ask for the salad special... they are pretty good."}
{"text":"Clean,and fast service.I'm a repeat customer.Will make sure you are satisfied.fresh ingredients are used for satisfaction guaranteed.love this place better than some of the top pizza chains,and it's cheaper."}
{"text":"My first time at this location and was disappointing. Place was dirty and the worst pizza ever. Followed the instruction as I always do, but crust was not crisp and taste was just off. Maybe because these were pre-made. De Forest location much better."}
{"text":"It's a funny thing - there is another Papa Murphy's location about a mile or so away, but I had never been there.  Now that this location opened less than a block from my house - and they were so kind as to send coupons -we decided to grab a pizza last weekend.  They have a great selection, and there is something for everyone.  Since this is a new establishment, it has been quite busy.  If there is a way to call ahead your order, I would definitely suggest doing that.  We waited in line for 10 or so minutes.  Everyone was helpful and friendly.  We ordered to pizzas - the sausage and the pepperoni.  The directions come on the package, and are easy to follow.  The pizza turned out delicious!  We will definitely be going back, there are a few pizzas I saw advertised that I want to try.  

This is a perfect place to pick up pizza for gameday!"}
{"text":"I received a Presto Pizzaz Plus pizza cooker for Christmas, which finally gave me a good excuse to try Papa Murphy's. Pretty dang good pie! The Pizzaz cooker does a superb job cooking any pizza, fresh or frozen. I like PM's because it's not the least bit greasy, and the crust is excellent. Pricing is slightly high considering you have to bake it yourself, hence the 4-star review - a better value would have made it 5. Be on the lookout for coupons to cushion the blow to your wallet."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Fast service tonight. Can't go wrong with Papa Murphy's pizza. We love the veggi pizza and of course the standard pepperoni too"}
{"text":"Really impressive service, I've been to this location several times now and every single time their customer service is amazing! Highly recommend this location :)"}
{"text":"This location is good.  Always like Papa Murphy's Pizza"}
{"text":"I like this place because they have consistently good food. Everything is fresh and if you call in your order it will be ready to pick up within just a few minutes, no matter how busy they are. They're especially good if you are picking up dinner on the way home but don't want to eat it right away. 10 minutes in the oven and you're ready!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place before their new management. The last two times I've been in, I've walked in to the entire store reeking of cigarette smoke. Disgusting, no one wants food that smells like an ash tray. The older lady who helped me, her name was Angela I believe, was extremely rude to me and stopped to yell at younger employees while helping me. The last time I went in she was not there so I asked the boy who helped me who she was and he told me she was their manager. I cannot believe a manager has the audacity to speak to customers and employees this way. I hate to see a great place ruined by bad management"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 10-10-15 around 5pm at the location on Blue Diamond and Decatur.  My GPS took me to the intersection so it took me a minute to find this place.  It's in the northwest corner of the intersection next to Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse.  
I love PM's pizza because it tastes better than any other take and bake pizza you can get at a supermarket, IMHO.  Today I got a medium Murphy's Combo with regular crust, a caesar salad, and some orange halloween chocolate chip cookie dough.  Murphy's combo, according to their website, is a \"crowd-pleasing combination of salami, pepperoni and sausage with sliced mushrooms, mixed onions, and black olives on a bed of traditional red sauce\". 
There was no crowd to please, just me stuffing my face with this delicious pizza.  Other people are worried about fitness, I am only worried about fitness whole pizza in my mouth.  
Minus one star because their family-size caesar salad came with one measly little packet of caesar dressing.  They really ought to give out two with a salad that size."}
{"text":"I like Papa Murphy's pizza. Its take and bake so if your in a hurry or dont want to wait to preheat your oven then it might not be the place for you. But we prefer it over Pizza Hut and Dominos. I like their delight pizzas, they're thin crust and have nice toppings like chicken, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, etc. This Raymond road location had really good service too. The last time we ordered I had a coupon and wanted to make sure we could use it. I probably confused her but she was very patient and asked a manager. She was very nice over the phone too. They are usually fast and have your order ready when you get there. You can also usually find coupons in the mail or online too. Papa Murphy's is a nice alternative to your traditional take out pizza chains."}
{"text":"For a take and bake it is good. Problem is, I wouldn't rate it any better than a pie from Papa Johns or Dominos. And it's actually more money. Why would I pay more to cook my own pizza when a carry out special at a chain is cheaper? I don't see this company lasting long. Good concept but hard to compete with the chains cooking it for you."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!

We have been frequenting this location fairly regularly for the past year. Had a problem once before, problem resolved.

Today we brought home a pan pizza and cooked the pizza. The pizza pan had a liquid literally bubbling out of the pan as it cooked. The oil, butter or whatever the liquid was, was pourable out of the bottom of the pan and made the entire crust greasy.

A phone call was made and the problem described. My wife offered to send pictures if she did not have to come back. We were told to just Bring the pizza back (of course).

Upon arrival, Matthieu was less than polite and requested the pictures. My wife asked why pictures were needed when he had the pizza? He said, \"you said you had pictures!\" Matthieu then asked where the liquid was? My wife had explain that it was poured down the drain. (Because we would drive an extremely greasy pizza back in our car).

Customer service is obviously not a priority here and we will not be back nor will we recommend Papa Murphy's again!

Do yourself a favor and DON'T waste your money or time!"}
{"text":"We have been very loyal to this place, ordering pretty much every week. This past week, we ordered our pizza online as normal, and I drove over to pick it up. They couldn't find my pizza and thought that a pizza which had been made was just missing a topping. They added this topping to complete the pizza. I asked what crust it was and the guy informed me it was an original crust. I asked them to double check on the computer what my husband ordered (as he had been ordering thin crust lately). The guy said he ordered an original. I took the pizza home (20 minute drive) and my husband informed me he ordered a thin crust pizza and showed me his online order (which stated thin crust) I called and complained and informed her that she should speak to her manager, and in the meantime, I would return there and pickup the correct pizza. Upon arrival, firstly the girl hadn't even bothered to make the pizza and secondly, she informed me that she spoke to the manager by the name of Nistasha (unsure of the spelling) and she said that they did not give refunds!!!! So, I then had to wait for her to make the new pizza. This was a massive waste of my time and appalling customer service. If you mess up Papa Murphy's, you should at the very least offer a refund. I made two 40 minute trips and waited for you to sort the pizza out twice. This is totally unacceptable. There isn't even an email address to contact you directly."}
{"text":"When we moved out of the Pacific Northwest, I sadly left my favorite place to pick up a pie on the way home from work on a cold and rainy night.BTW do NOT miss those cold and rainy days one bit! Just missed the pizza.  Called my beloved spousal unit and told him the oven temp and when I hit the door, we would have a hot pizza in less than 20 minutes. That being said, I was so happy to find this Papa Murphy's though I would LOVE to have one here in Summerlin for my convenience. LOVE the Gourmet vegetarian with red sauce (instead of white). Loaded with spinach, artichoke hearts, onions, zuchinni & tomatoes....add some olives and I'm all over it. They accommodate my beloved spousal unit's penchant for MEAT on one half and peace reigns in the LV Valley. Papa Murphy's, Thanks for bringing a taste of home to the desert!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, Take-and-bake.
Call ahead and pick it up on your way home from work.
Ingredients are fresh. Pizzas are assembled to order when you call. Lower calorie options. Vegetarian options. Good for even the pickiest eater."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a free medium cheese pizza with purchase of family size pizza. The coupon clearly indicates that this location is a participating location, but they told my wife they've \"asked to be removed\" from the coupon & would not honor it. My guess is this particular franchise location won't last with the type of customer experience they offer."}
{"text":"Watched a segment on Channel 3, Your Life A to Z, which showed me how to grill a pizza. Was a little skeptical at first but we've had it once at a friends house, a few weeks ago, and then tried it for ourselves last night.  Awesome results!! I'm renovating my kitchen right now, so being able to use the grill and not an oven was perfect!!

Definitely need to thank your PR group as I would have never known about the grill option and probably would have never tried you!

Will definitely be back!!"}

This is a take and bake pizza place which made me think twice at first because I was getting hungry but surprisingly, the take out was fast and only takes about 20 mins to bake it to goodness! Gotta have to come back and try their other delightful pizza flavors"}
{"text":"It's the subways of pizza, only you bake it at home. The stuffed pizza is the way to go."}
{"text":"Excellent customer! Immediately greeted with smiles at the door. We were told about the Yelp check in and received free cookie dough! Can't wait to get home and bake this bad boy. Will definitely be back. FYI for those that don't know, they just prep the pizza and you take it home and bake it yourself! You end up with a freshly made pizza!"}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's pizza. Fresh ingredients, and great recipes. Take home, bake and enjoy. Best pizza available. Can't get any more fresh. Very friendly people and low cost."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is cheap and I can make it at my convenience at home.  Can't argue with that.

unlike most other pizza places the size of their pies has not shrunk over time to try to garner more profits but the prices have gone up, but I can get an easy to modify pizza with a variety of toppings and they don't charge me an extra $2 per change like some other places.

Yeah, it's not instantly hot and I have to cook it at home but that is what makes it so you can get a huge pizza for the price of a tiny pizza from pizza hit.

Papa Murphy's has a life long customer in me."}
{"text":"First time trying Papa Murphy's brand pizza and will not be returning.  There was nothing outstanding about their pizzas.  Had a veggie, it was dry and tastelss.  Did not appear to have any sauce of any type.  Also had the daily special and again nothing exciting about the taste.  HyVee has way better pizza."}
{"text":"Phoned in an order for a peparoni & Sausage. When I showed up at the store the wait was still about 30 minutes or more. Two employees are in the store but only one is working the other is hiding in the back on the phone. As more people walk in who have placed either orders on line or via phone calls they still have to wait as if they had just walked in to order. Very poor preparation for business. I feel bad for the one employee who is trying to manage the orders and make the pizza and the phone continues to ring off the hook. This place needs more employees and at least one manager on site. I blame the district/general manager for allowing this."}
{"text":"Just went Into this location to order a pizza, but sadly it's all clueless college kids running the place. They were out of a variety of different types of crusts and sauces. It was a very awkward experience and the majority of the employees looked hung over. The work stations were untidy and there was food all over the place. If I go a Papa Murphys again, it will be at a different location with more competent employees."}
{"text":"Love it! Way better than big chain delivery. The ingredients are really good and they have a lot of specials like on Tuesdays. As far as recommendations I like everything that I have tried. The store is new and clean. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Terrible place. I called at 7:15 and it just rang & rang. I know they aren't busy.. Ever. Once someone picked up the phone to take my order has absolutely terrible phone etiquette. (Understanding he works in a pizza place) They don't care about there customers & just throw a pizza together. Poor poor service. Go to Frys and get a frozen pizza. I don't personally know how this place is still a business."}
{"text":"I love Papa Murphy's and have been there a number of times in the past however it has been hit and miss until tonight. Zack is the best addition to this business and whoever hired him needs to be thanked. He's nice, personable, happy, and makes you feel like he's listening to what you need. I can't say enough about this experience and next time you stop by Papa Murphy's say hello, and thank you, to Zack!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favourite pizzas. I would happily order anything from the menu and would much rather have a pizza from here then Pizza Bianco.

Stick the oven on at 425F. Go and visit a clean place, chat with the magic makers behind the counter while they prepare your order. They'll even hold the door open for you when you leave, which is a really nice touch in my opinion.

Lovely fresh ingredients every time, try the Veggie Deluxe and you'll see what I mean. Papa's Favourite is always high on the list and if you order the stuffed option prepare to be full after one slice.

The comments from people that think waiting 12-15 minutes when you get home to have a perfectly cooked pizza, is beyond my comprehension of the word lazy. After all you afforded the time to go there in the first place.

A little tip to the people that can afford the time and wait for a delicious pizza. Take it off the provided tray 2 minutes before it's ready and put it back in for the perfect base. But use oven gloves please and be careful as it'll be proper hot.

All in all a spot on place. I'm sorry about not giving it five stars. It is only pizza after all.

Thumbs up to the man that is Brent!"}
{"text":"The pizza is outstanding. The ingredients are fresh and you can actually taste the difference from other chains like Pizza Hut and Dominos. I do like Pizza Hut, but sometimes Papa Murphy's really hits the spot.

The downside is the employees at this location are just awful. They greet you with either a frown or a look of total boredom. They don't smile as they mumble a few words like, 'whatdoyouneed' or 'hicanitakeyourorder.' I don't need a fake, cheery greeting every time, but it would be nice if they didn't act like I was ruining their day by ordering a pizza.

The location is usually clean and the pizzas always taste great. I just wish they could get some employees who weren't jerks."}
{"text":"Black Angus Garlic and a cowboy pizza for late night munchies! Great value much better than did DiGorno piZZa ! Why have a pizza oven and no fresh pizza! Firing up the Pitt."}
{"text":"I live near this location and have been many times, so I can say from experience that it's fantastic.

I have never known their staff to be anything short of exceptionally friendly & hard working, and their food has never been anything but exceptional as well, not to mention really really tasty. The store itself always looks and smells like it's just been cleaned, which is highly appreciated, and they even accept the coupon card that I got for a different location.

Overall, this is a great place to get inexpensive, high-quality, freshly prepared take-&-bake pizza."}
{"text":"This location is great! The store is always very clean, they have a little art table for kids while you wait, the food is fresh and yummy, and the employees have all been good. Some better than others but no one less than average."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this location!

While I have no complaints with Papa Murphys food avoid this location at all costs. There are others close by that don't suffer from untrained staff and poor management. 

We ordered pizza this week and the person picking up the order was only given half of what we paid for by the' way too young to have a legal job' teen working behind the counter.
When we called to inform them of their mistake they told us they'd save it for us to pick up another day instead of refunding the amount spent, even though other locations are capable of refunding. 

When I asked for a manager there was not one present and it would be a day or two before they had one available. I guess a 12 year old is left in charge when the manager doesn't feel like coming in. The idiot in charge proceeded to tell me that he was in charge but couldn't help me because he wasn't trained on how to do that.

When I did finally get to speak to an adult on a different day I was I could get a few dollars off my next order or again pick up the old food another day. If I wanted to split the order over 2 days I would have. I ordered enough food for our family that night so leaving us with half a meal was a huge inconvenience for a busy family with kids. Your poor management and absence are not a customers fault and should be handled properly. You were not sympathetic to the issues you caused and trying to defend an employee's tactless choice of saying he can't do his job because you haven't trained him is inappropriate.

On top of the terrible customer service, idiotic comments, and complete lack of management the pizza we did receive was messed with the wrong toppings and misshapen to the point that deformed lump they tried to pass off as stuffed pizza broke apart all over as it was cooking."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The dough is gluten free. I recommend that you try all of their pizzas. I got the $5 deal, and trust me...you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff! Food is always made right and tastes good. They offer gluten free pizza and a great selection of toppings."}
{"text":"We frequent this location at least monthly. Great every time, but the pizza last night was the best it's ever been! The gentleman behind the counter was polite and talkative, and the braiding on the crust of our stuffed Chicago pizza, made my OCD excited with the perfectness of it! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for convenience, location, fresh ingredients and how wonderful the staff is. Sure I can get a tastier pizza at the mellow mushroom at twice the price but this is a great meal when you are in a rush.  The price for side items is also very reasonable and specials run all the time. Today we snagged cookie dough for one dollar.  Everyone at home was pleased."}
{"text":"I visit this location once a week.  They offer consistently great pizza and customer service.  The manager Ian has the place happy & friendly.  The staff is always interacting with the customers.  Chatting them up, joking around.  When I call my order in they tell my 15-20 minutes but it is always ready in 10 minutes.  They are great!  They accept frequently advertised coupons."}
{"text":"Convenient online ordering is how we get our pizza order in.  You are welcome to call or even go to the restaurant to order, but with the bonus coupons for online ordering it's easy and affordable.  The menu is large enough to choose your pizza style and the taste is great.  

However you are also paying for a pizza you still need to bake, so dinner isn't quite done right away.  Overall, it's quick, reasonably priced and the store also carries drinks and pre-mixed cookie dough which is fantastic.  You watch them add your toppings so you know your pizza is fresh.  There is also a gluten free crust option now which is fantastic for those people who can't have gluten.

The staff were friendly enough, though I think they could do better with an extra one or two."}
{"text":"Love Papa Murphy's pizzas! Always easy to find coupons in mailers too. Just wish they were open later."}
{"text":"what a surprise, very good pizza"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and they make sure that your order is made to perfection which I really appreciate. I really appreciated the fact that the order wasn't rushed and sloppy :)"}
{"text":"The is by far the best Pizza I've had in Las Vegas. It was so jucy and hot that I ate 2 Slices...And them suckers are huge! Go Carbs!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is delish! But you might want to check your order. Just got home with a Hawaiian Pizza and it is missing the pineapples! Total bummer when I called the location they said if I want a refund I would have to bring it in. That's not going to happen since I picked it up to feed my family and I had to cook it."}
{"text":"Place is clean and the service is friendly and fast--ingredients on the pizza are fresh.

Not sure about taking a pie home to cook it when just down the street Pizza Hut will do it for you :) Didn't Kramer on the tv show Seinfeld have an idea like this? Yeah, I know it's not their business model, but I'd order a lot more if they'd offer the option to have the pie cooked there. 

Well, if you don't mind cooking your own pizza, this place is solid."}
