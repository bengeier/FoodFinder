{"text":"This may be your local greasy spoon and expectations are tempered...but it's not a good experience at all. Horrible breakfast bar, service is slow, everything comes out cold. There's much better choices....enough said."}
{"text":"Locally owned diner, & a good value!  

Most meals come with soup & salad bar, plus free dessert!  The soups are homemade & are very good!  The salad bar consists of several homemade salads, fresh fruit, pudding bread, & more. They also have a variety of daily specials ranging from $7.99 to $14, which includes the soup, salad bar, & choice of dessert.  Some of my favorites include the beef tip over noodles, & the pork tenderloin.  

For dessert they offer the full line of Mama Jo's Pies, cheesecake, homemade rice pudding, layer cakes, ice cream, sundaes, & old fashioned milkshakes.  Service is always very good, & the owner makes you feel right at home.  The only downside is that the decor is very dated, & could use an update!  However if you don't like the decor, you can sit at the nice outdoor patio in the warmer months!

Overall, a good local diner with great value!"}
{"text":"It was OK.  I had an omelet and it was nothing special.  Not bad, not fantastic.  A good value for the money."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional diner style breakfast. I get the same thing every time I come. The decor is very outdated and older. With some updating and maybe new items to the menu, this place could be more stars."}
{"text":"Gourme is what it is... a cheap diner with an in-expensive lunch buffet.  Very friendly staff.  Never been offended... never been impressed.  The out of date decor and CRT TV's give it some character :)

Not worth driving out of your way to visit... but if you're in the area looking for a cheap, relaxing breakfast or lunch, stop in!"}
{"text":"Happy to find a place open on Thanksgiving day but the breakfast buffet was not great and the soda was flat. Service was great, no one crabby about working a holiday. I just didn't like the taste of nearly anything on the buffet. The eggs with peppers and such in it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The place is clean and fresh, the menu is large, they have great prices and the food is good.  The soup and salad bar is good, but the soup is amazing. Especially the beef vegetable. They are homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"While I was visiting Ohio I ended up eating here more than I would had like to because the people I was staying with like this place. 

Had the spinach, mushroom and feta cheese omelet with hash brown and wheat toast.. My omelette was cook in way too much butter or margarine it totally kill the taste of the other ingredients. The toast had way to much butter too .. I felt like my arteries just clogged up from this buttery breakfast.

I tried the Gyro the next day and it was just blah! nothing special. 

The service was excellent very attentive and nice and the prices are super affordable."}
{"text":"Well the potato cakes were good. The bacon wasnt burnt.  But the biscuits were rock hard and sausage gravy was thick (but at least it has flavor).  The waffles, hash browns, eggs were a little too long under the heat lamps.   There are better choices."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm a bit biased as this is my local diner, but for eggs, toast, and a cup of coffee, topped with a friendly smile, Gourm√© is my go-to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Hash browns were blah tasting and very dry. Not a great place for breakfast, but our waitress was super nice! Too bad the food wasn't."}
{"text":"Was hungry and craving breakfast so I decided to try this place out.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the waitress informed me that it was cheese so I wouldn't be surprised.  It looked fantastic! But there was so much cheese on my plate I could hardly taste anything else.  The service was absolutely amazing!!! Our server Micki was a total sweetheart and very welcoming.  She definitely has good vibes coming from her which made me enjoy my first time here until I couldn't taste my eggs and ham because of the overload of cheese.  Service was very attentive and fast.. only waited around 15-20 min for my meal."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice but was quite slow. The food was somewhere between better than average and almost stellar. We would definitely come back and try it again."}
{"text":"A pretty average, family owned and run, joint.  The people are pretty nice.

I only ever go for breakfast and I'm rarely  disappointed.  They have a pretty good variety of things to pick from.

Overall, this place is run of the mill but good every once in a while."}
{"text":"Great diner-type place and perfect for breakfast. The menu is large and the omelettes are delicious. The staff is so nice here!"}
{"text":"Well I should have known when we walked and there was food all over the table and seats. I mentioned to my 5 yr old let me clean that up first, the hostess didn't offer to clean it up. The biscuits were similar to hockey pucks. My husband ordered corned beef and hash special (thinking that a place that advertises fresh corn beef) would have fantastic corned beef and hash...WRONG. If you like canned then you will enjoy this. The hash browns on the breakfast bar were awful. For two adults and one kids meal we spent $35 plus tip. The sweet old waitress was adorable and kind but the food was horrible !!"}
