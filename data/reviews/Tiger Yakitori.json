{"text":"I had the zucchini squash, chicken, shrimp, and the mushroom skewers. Made it a combo to add rice. Maybe it was the soggy, tepid vegetables or the bland rice, but I will never be eating from this food truck again."}
{"text":"I got my first taste of Tiger Yakitori during Miranda Lambert's concert at the Belk Bowl. I was beyond satisfied with their special (4 Skewers and a ton of delicious rice) just for $9. It was hands down the best priced food truck out there. I had the Zucchini Squash, chicken, pork belly, and green onions! The sauce is so detectable,  sweet and savory at the same time. Everything was cooked perfect neither overcooked nor undercooked and it really didn't take too long at all!  After I ate that box of food I went back because I saw someone eating their french fries and they looked absolutely delicious! And boy were they! The fries came with a side of wasabi Ranch which was phenomenal! I can honestly say that they are the best fries I have ever had! I also got another combo box of Rice and chicken to take home along with this delicious orange cream soda they have!"}
{"text":"Quite awful. Over cooked burnt shrimp on a stick. Don't get the combo. It's cheaper if you just get things separate. But anyway don't get anything.. u can grill food a 100 times better."}
{"text":"Grilled meat. Who doesn't like grilled meat? Okay. Well, you Vegans just stay out of this.  Great food to eat while tasting in a taproom! As I entered D-9, I spied the Tiger Striped Truck and knew I was going to get my Yakitori on!!  I ordered the 4 skewers with rice for $9 special; definitely a good type of food for sharing! The chicken thigh was hands down the best, followed by the shitake, shrimp and beef (a little fatty).  The second best part was turning my skewers into make shift chopsticks and eating the rice covered in Teriyaki meat juices!! Primal and delicious, grrr. I felt like a Yakitori Tiger indeed.   I thought it was smart that they put out menus on the tables in D-9 (sometimes you don't know you're hungry until you see a picture of food) and there was a \"runner\" who would bring your food inside to you. Off to a good start guys!!"}
{"text":"HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG... MEAT ON A STICK!  Seriously, this Food Truck has become my FAVORITE in Charlotte.  It must say something that I would travel across town for their food.  Don't take my word... try them for yourself.  YOU WILL BECOME a TIGER YAKITORI fan too!"}
{"text":"Steak so good you'll want to slap your momma.  Seriously it's the most tender and juicy steak ever. And it's on a stick...convenient and delicious!"}
{"text":"Hit this truck up at the Steele Creek Athletic Association Food Truck Saturday Event.  Very friendly service and wait wasn't bad at all.  Prices are quite reasonable.  I got the 5 skewers for $12 is my memory is correct and you can get any 5 that they offer... you mix and match... heck, you can get 5 of the same kind.  I got the steak (2), shrimp, mushroom and meatballs.  They were all very good except the meatball.  That one didn't taste homemade.  There are several more SCAA events yet this year, if we go back, we will visit Tiger again."}
{"text":"A food truck that grills meat. Heck, yes! On offer today, grilled chicken thighs, grilled meatballs, grilled pork belly and for the vegetarians out there, a grilled half corn cob. And more.  I opted for the chicken and it was very tasty. Just the right amount of \"burnt\" with a lot of meat on the skewer. Nice and hot, plus it was completely not drippy at all. Perfect eating and walking food!"}
{"text":"Super Tasty!  The menu is easy and simple; food came out quick, hot and scrumptious.   Best tip about this place: The steak is good and perfectly cooked, but surprisingly the chicken was even better!"}
