{"text":"This place is a winner: spacious, bright interior, varied types of seating (shaggy green nook, one of those lecture hall chair/desk things!), fast wifi, good coffee, not too busy.

Espresso only. No Drip.

I'm here on a late Sunday morning, writing Yelp reviews and procrastinating on my graduate school research, overhearing conversations about social justice and watching the parade of characters passing through the yet-to-be-gentrified neighborhood outside the window. I guess this is the dream."}
{"text":"Love this new cafe at Davenport and Ossington! Relaxing atmosphere, excellent coffee and treats and great music! Unique art, woodwork, and jewelry for sale. Also, events! Just what the area needed."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. It's quirky and the tea and coffee is great. Also has some yummy snacks (vegan options usually!)  Great place to read or work for a while. The wifi is super quick. So lucky to have this great little place in the neighbourhood. Run by an artist (I think) who displays and sells her work there. Also, has events every once in awhile!"}
{"text":"Delicious Americanos. The ham and cheese scone was to die for. And, the woodworking is a wonderful bonus - I've made several purchases of art and jewellery there, and the pieces are all funky and unique."}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING cafe and such a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Delicious coffee and snacks at reasonable prices, plus lots of cool local art for sale. It's an ideal place to spend an afternoon chatting with friends or getting some work done-- the owner doesn't mind if you come in to work on your laptop as long as you buy things every so often. I love this place so much!"}
{"text":"Came by for a to go coffee on my way to tutor in the neighbourhood. The vibe is friendly and chill but not overdone. The place is really spacious and bright - a perfect place to and work on your laptop. I will definately be back everytime I come to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I travelled an hour to try this place out because it sounded cool. I like that they are eco-friendly and the food looked lovely... but sadly the music was so loud I left without staying. I prefer music at a level that I can either work or chat with friends... but not like a club in a coffee shop. That is just me!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this new cafe in the davenport and ossington neighborhood, the coffee is excellent, they focus on a good quality cup of coffee which is why I come here. Good music too."}
