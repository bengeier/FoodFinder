{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times. The food is decent. The owners are nice. Portion sizes are pretty big imo. They have daily specials which are a good deal.  I went in with a groupon but i think the prices are not high. Food quality is good."}
{"text":"Fairly new place only had their burger once but damn it tasted good. havent had the chance to try out other menu options. But at least it not anohter halal shawama shop :)"}
{"text":"Being right beside at least five other eateries, there's really no point in going here.

Maybe it's fine if you like your warm food cold and if you despise your food having flavour."}
{"text":"Had takeout tonight. Jerk chicken and rice and beans. Also goat curry and salad. Each of those, in small takeout boxes, was $3.50. I've had snacks more expensive than that. Portions are pretty good. Jerk chicken was flavorful. Not particularly spicy, but that's the way I prefer it. Chicken was tender too. Looked like a leg and a thigh. A leg and a thigh + rice and beans for $3.50. Can I get a location closer to my house please?"}
{"text":"Calypso Chicken and Rice ($5.99) Special of the Day is not that special after all.

Fried dark meat chicken cooked in a spicy sauce then reheated in a microwave in a Styrofoam box was a little cold. While I was eating my semi heated chicken and eyeing Tangerine next door, maybe I should have went there for some real heat and spice?

Halal friendly..

I still don't get it about heating up food in a microwave in a Styrofoam container??

A side note: While I was drinking my Pineapple Ginger Nectar($1.95), I just realized that if I finished the whole bottle of this juice, I would have consumed 280 calories and 62 g of sugar... maybe that's why I am on a sugar high now?"}
