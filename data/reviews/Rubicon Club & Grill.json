{"text":"HICKS AND CHICKS on Thursday Nights at the Rubicon! Yeehaw!
This is the old Stoney's location and my favorite hang out for Country Dancing including Line Dances on the Biggest and Best dance floor in Las Vegas.
DJ Montana plays a great mixture of country and pop and keeps the floor filled, always fun to watch the dancers! They have lessons if you don't know the dances or just get out there and try to follow along! lol
He even plays sets of freestyle dancing for those that don't know how to do the other dances! That's when the people watching is the best!!! 
The Drinks are not outrageously priced like other strip dance clubs, and ladies drink for $1 (well drinks) I don't like beer but $20 all you can drink draft for anyone that does. Just don't bring your drink on the dance floor, your little spills make the dance floor a slip and slide for girls in high heels! No Bueno!
There is a giant area for Beer Pong and even more entertaining is watching people ride the Bull! There is always some girl in a short dress trying to show off her panties! I'm not kidding!
Tip Jason (the Bull operator) and he will make you look like you know how to ride! 
I Love this place and all the people that work here, if I had to work I'd work here! 
As it is I just come here to play..... Every Thursday Night! ;)"}

{"text":"Attended Rubicons Country ladies night last Thursday and had a great night out! The DJ was awesome playing a perfect mix of new and older songs not the same boring 10 songs that most country bars play now a days. The dance floor is very spacious (perfect for the line dancing) along with the rest of the bar. There is also a bull and beerpong Candi the bull operator gave us a great ride (tip her a she goes easier on you haha) All the staff was very attentive and the cocktail waitress are allowed to join in on dancing which is fun for the guys. I will definitely be back"}
