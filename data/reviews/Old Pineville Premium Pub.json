{"text":"I wish my first experience here wasn't breakfast.  I wanted to try this place after all good reviews, and I just happened to be driving by running errands and saw their breakfast sign.  It was around 9:30am on a Saturday, and I was the only person in the place.  That always makes me wonder?!  Strip mall needs a little cleanup, but the inside is very clean, comfortable, and open with both booths and tables in addition to the bar area with multiple large screens and an outdoor patio on front of building.    I was only going to drop by quickly to grab the $4.99 2-egg, sausage, toast, potatoes and coffee special.  But after looking at the menu, I'm always a sucker for an Eggs Benedict.  The waitress was new here for a week and seemed new to waitressing in general.  No problem as we all need to learn.  However, when she asked me how I wanted my eggs for Eggs Benedict, I was surprised and worried.  I said poached and not runny.  No such luck.  The eggs were completely liquid and ran all over my plate.  The bread was thick and completely entrenched in butter, and my very thin and burnt slice of some type of meat was very inedible.  But no, not the Hollandaise miss?!  Yes, I hate to say, the Hollandaise was more of a cheesy mixture.  Sigh...  As sometimes happens when the waitress notices you completely are not enjoying your meal, she avoided me like the plague.   With now only two diners in the place, she finally came to only ask if I was ready for the bill. Hmm...I think I'll give it some time and try again but only for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely our new favorite weekend breakfast place. Delicious and inexpensive mimosas as well as second visit required for more French toast! We'll keep coming."}
{"text":"Our appetizers and entrees were excellent.  Friendly owner welcomed us when we entered and checked of us during the meal.  Service was on point.  Overall, quality, clean, and tasty."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Unique recipes.  Good wing selection. Nice bartenders. These people have a well done sports bar pub program working."}
{"text":"Meh... OK food.  OK wine.  OK service."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat at the pub but had food catered for a party of 22.  It was very delicious and price reasonable for what we got.  Loved the redneck egg rolls and the greek salad was wonderful.  Also good were the barbecue pork sliders and the spanakopita was outstanding.  I hope to be able to go back and eat at the restaurant next time I am in Charlotte.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and was very happy we did so.  We both got wings and all for flavors were very good.  I had the stinger and Buffalo hot, cooked well.  They came out crispy and wet in the sauce.  Service and atmosphere were good.  I was looking for a place close by with good wings and I just might have found it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Old Pineville Premium Pub!! My husband and I stumbled upon this place a while back, as we were looking for bars close to our home. Last night we came by to watch the Panthers game and I realized I never wrote a review!!  The many things I love about this pub.... -It's clean inside. Nicely decorated. Like it feels like a nicer pub -It is a bit of a local pub, kinda hidden. Thus, it isn't always crazy busy there. We were able to easily find bar seats to watch the game and didn't have to go there early to get them!  -Lots of seating -Great beer prices. They don't have many local taps but the prices are great. -Good pub food. The wings are good and lots of flavors. Sliders are awesome too. -Most importantly, the chill atmosphere. You can just be yourself!"}
{"text":"Alright I can't say enough about the food. Very unique and trendy items. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I went to this place two nights in a row just to try different entr√©es. Salmon was awesom and I thoroughly enjoyed the turkey burger. Give this place a stop when you're passing through. I will definitely be back next time I am on the south side."}
{"text":"The whole thing was disgusting. I ordered takeout, when I opened the box the first thing I saw was a super brown piece of lettuce. I took the top off and saw a black thing on the lettuce also. I then took it off, looked at my sandwich( which was SUPPOSED to be a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich) it was really a piece of soggy fried chicken, no buffalo sauce. The fires where gross. My boyfriend ordered their Carolina Burger, which was supposed to come with Chili, pickles, onion and slaw. It came with a barley drop of chili, and four baby onions. This was a terrible lunch"}
{"text":"Great Bartenders, great food, and a wide selection of booze and beer. Plus the crowd is pretty entertaining if you are into people watching."}
{"text":"Chased away from the start! _(?^?)?  Ummmmmmm so I walked in excited to try the food because of the reviews and photos. However, upon entry I was greeted by a hostess who gave me a super dirty, prejudgment, uncomfortable to assist me type look. It was one of those...\"why are you in here\" looks. I kid you not, I turned around and walked out.  I won't go as far to say that it had everything to do with me being a beautiful brown goddess, but it felt racial. The fact that the restaurant welcomed bikers, didn't cause me to shy away as I wanted to remain open and unbiased, although historically, racism has been prevalent amongst biker gangs. Why should I allow that to stop me from having a great culinary experience?   This goes to show that 1st impressions are everything. An off-putting roll of the eyes by a hostess can send business running out the front door. I hope I'm wrong, especially being that my money is green like everyone else's."}
{"text":"So we came to Three Spirits Brewery and discovered this place.  We lucked out and they just opened so they actually delivered the food to the bar!  How sweet is that.  Of course,  no guarantees  that will continue  with free delivery or dlivery at all in the future but they are close enough to grab a bite on the way home.  We ordered the black and Bleu house chips and redneck egg rolls. Both were absolutely delicious! The house chips were the best I ever had, crispy every bite to  the end. It was great that they paired with another local business to help promote their opening. Smart choice.  Not too keen on the name of this place. The owners could have been a bit more creative. However, we will definitely be back for more. They have so many other delicious choices."}
{"text":"Under impressed lunch. Fries were rubbery, over cooked, deepfried grease sticks. Burger was \"men\", bread was dry and meat wasn't flavorful. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Travel all over and this was another YELP discovery. Was thrilled to find amazing Greek flavours and seasonings on my grilled chicken. The accompanying broccoli was stir fried wth lots of fresh garlic. Haven't had such high quality cooking and f flavours at a pub before. Enjoy"}
{"text":"4 starts. I went for the first time and it was pretty good. Service was good. Beer selection and price were spot on. Food was better than most in this genre. I wasn't sure what to expect but they exceeded beyond that. I will return and hopefully everything remains the same. The burger was very good, the side of fries was plentiful and well prepared. They have plenty of parking and seating inside as well as enough tv's if you want to keep on eye on some sports."}
{"text":"Steak burger is juicy and cooked to perfection on a warm bun with slightly seasoned skinny fries.  Best choice between fries and house chips is definitely fries.  Wings are crunchy outside, moist inside and sweet chilli sauce is light and not spicy, but tasty.  Waitress quick to fix a small mix up and very knowledgeable about beer options and afternoon specials.  Today, Shock Top 3.50 and a nice fresh orange slice.    Clean off the main road in an older spot along the road, the place  offers outside seating."}
{"text":"This is not your average bar food. Everything on the menu that my wife and I have tried so far has been delicious. I love their fried green tomatoes and the black bean burger was enormous. Ordered take out through Yelp and the food was ready and right on time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Clean place with great food. Seems a little off the beaten path but totally worth checking out. I had the whiskey chicken sandwich and it was outstanding. It's obvious everything is handmade. If I lived closer this would be a place I'd frequent. Causal atmosphere and nice staff"}
{"text":"Came here during a visit to the areafor my daughter's lax tournament. We stayed at a nearby hotel and decided to go here based on the reviews.   I had wings. Half greek, half medium buffalo.  They were good although the roasted Greek could have been more flavorful. Daughter had the gyro which looked good.   The food was solid, they had a good local beer selection, reasonable prices and live music in the patio. If we lived close by we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place and the food, especially the wings. I hear the burgers are good, but I haven't gotten that far into the menu. The people are very nice and welcoming... Kind of reminds me of the old TV show Cheers...."}
{"text":"Very friendly neighborhood pub with some great lunch specials and dinner items. The server promptly greeted us and sat us when we walked into the restaurant. Everyday they have a different lunch special and I opted for the chicken strips. Soup, a drink, and the entree totaled $8.95 - very affordable. The chicken was a little dry and slightly over cooked. The rice was a little dry, but other than that, it was quite tasty.  Will return for something else next time!"}
{"text":"Yelp you have seriously let me down.  Hoping for some solid grub close to our hotel, we chose this pub based on Yelp reviews...complete fail.  The server was sweet and the Yuengling on tap cold and fresh, but all was downhill after that.  Queso dip was flat and boring, fried jalape√±os were the only flavor in it, and served with tortilla chips that tasted 1000 years old...completely stale and soft.  My BLT on sourdough was nice, but served with 1000 year old \"chips\"...completely stale and zero flavoring.  Hubby's pulled pork Sammy was nice and the coleslaw fresh and with a nice vinegary bite, the brioche bun was fresh and tasty too.  But served with the same sad, stale potato chips, WTH??? Sad waste of $50 and a night in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nothin special about this place. It kind of feels like a Coney Island. The lighting is weird, to bright for a bar. It is, and feels like a shopping plaza bar. My  burger was very good. They have a nice selection of beers and lots of TVs to watch sports. The server did a great job. Not a bad experience, but I won't go back because of the lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"Wish I could give -7 stars. The service was so slow I might have well scheduled my funeral there. Which I'm guessing the other clientele have done because we were 20 years younger than everyone in there. (They should refer to themselves as a diner instead of a Premium Pub) When someone finally came over to us, she was rude and off-putting. I ordered the Shrimp n Grits and my stomach didn't feel right for 3 days. My boyfriend and his friends got burgers and they were burnt and dry. Don't know how this place is still in business. Take my advice and never go."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem of a bar that is fortunately for me located right around the corner from my house! My wife and I stumbled upon this place by chance, but have now been back a few times on miscellaneous occasions. Our latest visit was to grab some dinner (since our fridge was bare and the thought of the grocery store seemed overwhelming) and catch the end of the Panthers season opener. What I have found you get with Old Pineville is a clean, upscale pub that serves a wide selection of good beer and a fresh and equally wide array of great pub grub.   First off, I'm impressed how clean the place is. Plenty of TV's, seating, patio space, and they also use one of the TV's to display their current beer and draft selection. Speaking of, it is an impressive list. I think they had around 15 beers on tap when I was there. For food our last visit we ended up getting some wings and burger sliders (a.k.a. football food) and sitting at the bar. All of the food came out relatively quick and was really tasty.   Another nice thing about this place is that it isn't absolutely swamped. I'm all about atmosphere for certain occasions, but I can't handle the crowds at places like All American for every Panther's game. If you want a spot where you can actually sit, watch and hear the game, and also have some side conversations with the people you came (or met at the bar), then this might be the place for you. Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"This is such a little hole-in-the-wall place but their food is SERIOUSLY good for SERIOUSLY good prices. Hey have drink and dinner specials for each night of the week. The staff is so unbelievably friendly and the service was phenomenal.   I came on taco Tuesday and got a gyro taco and a boom boom shrimp taco with chips and salsa for $5.99! You seriously can't beat that!   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've had a few encounters with Old Pineville Premium Pub.  The first was when food was being delivered to my friends at Three Spirits during a neighborhood social.  The delivery man - who I can also guess owns? the Pub was interested in doing an event with my neighborhood.  I heard the food was delicious.  The second encounter was for our neighborhood social/brunch.  We had a table of 20-or so outside and although the service was a bit off (which I can't blame them), the food was great and they were super nice.  The third encounter was a quick late night dinner - my first time actually inside.  The pub has tons of TVs - a great place to catch up on sports, and great daily specials!  Appetizers are half off from 4-6 Monday through Friday.  We ordered tacos and buffalo chicken sliders - both were great."}
{"text":"I'm somewhere between Evan G, Ashley S, and Jeff S.  Pricing is wallet friendly, food is bar-type with extra flair, staff is friendly and informative, and parking is a breeze.  I agree it doesn't really qualify as a neighborhood pub; however, folks were hanging with their friends, making new ones, while a trio of 60+ year olds flirted with the bartender (like they stood a chance).  McCoy's is 100 yards away and they manage the same flux of hungry souls, too, so apparently not a big deal.   I ordered the Cialis Burger because I wanted a juicy hunk of meat with an egg running all over my plate  (and not because I need help getting it up.  Hey, that's what it says on the menu--just need to vanquish any doubts!).  Both the burger and egg were cooked perfectly.  I added salt, however.  The shoestring fries were a surprise.  Gone.  Overall, a do-over and another place to take Lori on a Saturday.  Give 'em whirl!"}
{"text":"I am with Jeff on this one - glad to see a new restaurant in an area that desperately needs new restaurants - but 5 stars?  Not from what I had, perhaps I picked the wrong dishes.  We were seated at a booth in the window in perhaps the most uncomfortable booth ever.  I am 5'9 and felt like I was sitting in a hole.  But it's a new restaurant!  With great reviews!  So we're going to keep going.  An order of fried green tomatoes was going to be split as an appetizer with my dining partner.  There were three thin, tough tomatoes that were fried in a decently seasoned coating served with goat cheese that was very creamy/good and a sauce that was liberally applied that overwhelmed every other flavor.  This is not a dish that I would order again based on personal preferences, but it was well plated/presented and if you like a kick, these would be for you.    My meal order was just an appetizer of chicken skewers.  Mediterranean spices on the chicken that was juicy and well prepared, but an oily sauce that went along with it just made a mess and didn't add anything to the flavor.    My friends' Mediterranean salad was huge with fresh ingredients, so their salads look like winners.    The price was reasonable, the service was fine.  The sliders looked good - or at least seemed to be good based on the gentleman at the table next to us that was swallowing them whole.   I will definitely go back and try a burger - those being delivered around us looked like a better choice than my selections. With better choices on my part, I may come back with a higher review."}
{"text":"I wish this was my neighborhood hangout. Great beer selection and solid food. Not to mention that Emily behind the bar is friendly and knows how to control the regulars."}
{"text":"It seems like this place had some great food as I saw several families pile in and went there for just food. I thought that was pretty interesting as I just went for just beers. I came here for just a couple of beers and to hang out with a friend that was visiting in town and since we were both there we picked this place out of the magic of Yelp and well just a bar that was open.   What we received in return was friendly service, good beers, and all of it pretty decently priced. They accommodated us wherever we decided to sit and the overall experience was pretty good. One thing to keep in mind however is that sitting outside can be loud with all the traffic noise. I would recommend to sit inside if there's space, but hey, if it's packed and it's the only place you can sit...there's TVs outside for your viewing pleasure. I definitely recommend to check out this spot and if I ever come across this place again I'll have to eye that menu."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, it wasn't very busy but I was really impressed by the service. Manager came over to check on us twice. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was pretty solid. Nothing fancy but good."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp and was not disappointed. There are plenty of big screens so you can catch any game you want to see and their menu was huge. Tons of food and drink options. Cozy no frills pub with a big bar and plenty of tables.  My boyfriend had one of their chicken entrees and I had the fish and chips. Their fish was one of the best I've ever had - it was fantastic. We also tried their fried green tomatoes which were excellent. No complaints about the food at all.   The only negative was the service. We were here on a Sunday afternoon, the bar was full of what seemed to be regulars watching college basketball.. but we were the ONLY table and the service was extremely slow. The bar regulars were all taken care of quickly.. but we sat.. and sat.. and sat. (The woman working the bar didn't seem to have much help, but she did the best she could.)  Definitely not a 5 start place, but great food!"}
{"text":"Our first time - but we will definitely be back .. very good food .. great service ... loved the atmosphere on the back patio .."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were trying to decide where to go to have lunch the other day. He wanted chicken and waffles I wanted tacos... voila!! Yelp had done it again! We found this place on the map and decided to give it a try and what a hidden gem! This is a neighborhood pub that I would never have even known it existed it's tucked into the end of a tiny shopping road off old pineville rd. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was only one lady on to take care of the bar and the tables and a man that greeted people at the door. We beat the rush and at first this was going to be a quiet place but as were soon proven otherwise about 8 tables all walked in right at 1230 but she handled it like a pro and you really couldn't tell she was the only person on!  The food was amazing and they make everything in house which you could really taste. Their menu had something for everyone too which was great he got his chicken and waffles and I got my tacos! They were both outstanding I was lucky to get a bite of his to try and the chicken was delicious perfectly seasoned and crispy. I think the only thing I would have changed was the fish they use for the tacos they use Swai (hope I'm spelling that right) but I'm a stickler for something with more density to it as the swai was too soft, mahi mahi is my fave so I'm biased.   All in all it was a great spot and I can't wait to go back to ty something else on the menu they seem to have it all!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. It truly is a premium sports bar. Old Pineville has been open about two months now and this was the first time we'd been by. We should have come sooner - food to price ratio is a winner. Service can't be beat either. Come football season this will be the spot.   To start, we had the boom boom shrimp appetizer and it was excellent. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, the batter/breading was crunchy, and the sauce was on point. I have to emphasize how well the shrimp was cooked because a lot of folks overcook their shrimp (and you can tell the difference when their done right). We also split some wings and a salad. The wings were great, super crispy and not fatty. We tried the sweet chili, the barbalo, and the bourbon barbecue. The barbalo was our favorite of those. The salad we had was the Orchard Salad (grilled chicken, matchstick apples, dried cranberries, candied walnuts, and goat cheese over mixed greens). The salad was awesome, but maybe too generous with the high-end toppings. We drank good beers and the prices beat most places. The prices overall were very good.   If you're in the neighborhood, you should be a regular."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant thanks to Yelp as it is close to our hotel. Just flew in from California for a rugby tournament and wanted a beer after the long day of travel. This place was great!  Super nice waitress and very engaged and polite owner/operator. They were both very friendly and added to our visit. They were neither absent not too present at our table.  Just right.   Hubby had the wings with bourbon BBQ sauce and he raved about them. Said the sauce was excellent.  I had the chicken Cobb salad and it was delicious. The chicken was marinated in something really tasty. Overall it was terrific. Both entrees were priced low in our opinion.   Tried two different beers on tap we were not familiar with and really liked them.   A great way to end our long day traveling to our special event!  I added photos of our entrees."}
{"text":"Come on a night where we're the only guests seated at a table.  That's disconcerting, so we're contemplating turning around and heading somewhere else.   But we're here, and we're hungry, so we decided to give it a shot.  No complaints at all about the service.  Heather was very friendly and answered all of our questions and took great care of us.  The owner also came by to check on us.  The food was a mix. I agree with the statement of the menu being more pub like, but the salad I had was huge, the lettuce fresh, the salad dressing homemade (but a little watery) with great croutons.  I had the boom boom shrimp which also tasted very fresh and was quite tasty.  My wife had the nachos, and I was a little disappointed in those, chips did not seem to be the freshest to me, and the queso was just okay.  In summary, it's worth a shot if you're looking for a good, slightly out of the way pub experience."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night it wasn't packed at all. Service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. They had a $3 mimosas drink special it is so worth it. I ordered a BLT with an egg on it. That sandwich was  Hubby ordered 3 tacos they all were so good. This my 1st time trying this place I will be back again real soon."}
{"text":"Went to meet Tom for lunch today. We wanted a place where we could hang out and talk AND have a decent lunch.  We were lucky they tolerated us being there for over four hours, as there was a lot of catching up to do!   I would say that this is a pub first and a restaurant second.   The bar area and selection of beers looked phenomenal.  It strikes me as funny that there were many patrons sipping on their beers and cocktails so early in the day, but who am I to judge?  I ordered grilled chicken strips that came with stewed green beans,  rice, mac and cheese, onions, and peppers. It had a brown gravy over it. It was a lunch special for Monday.  While it was nothing to write home about, it definitely was priced right and it more than filled me up.   I found the mac and cheese to have a funny taste, the green beans were delicious, and the chicken was average.     Great atmosphere overall with music that was not blaring.  I am definitely glad that I tried this out. It seemed like a locally owned place (not sure about this) and I do like to support the mom and pop type places.   In the four hours that I was there, I probably got my money's worth on iced tea refills.   That means I had way too much caffeine and will be up way too late tonight - prancing back and forth to the bathroom.  Not every day do i get four hours talking with Tom, so the bathroom thing will be marked up as small potatoes."}
{"text":"Found out about this place quite by accident when my wife and I decided to checkout the Three Spirits Brewery.  One of the servers handed us the menu and told us they had just opened and were delivering although they were located just around the corner.  Not sure if that service will continue, but it's a nice touch.  After getting past the name of this place, which I think should be reconsidered, i perused their menu. Simply put, their food choices rock.  They have burgers, sandwhiches, comfort food sides, and some awesome appetizers.  Even more impressive is their prices which are ridiculously inexpensinve.  In point of fact, I think they are a little to inexpensive. They'll likely have to go up a bit once they get their costs worked out.    We had already prepared our slow cooker dinner at home, so we decided to use this as an opportunity to get their appetizers and sides.  I was not disappointed. Their Redneck Eggrolls were simply divine: I could have eaten that as my main dish. But, it was their black and Bleu house chips that really took the cake.  I have never had house chips anywhere-ever that were perfectly made and so crispy you could chew on them for a whole minute and still be crunching away when it was time swallow.  Wow.  I can not emphasize enough how good those chips were.  Amazing.  So, we did not have a main dish, but I know we'll be checking out their digs the next time we head that way.  Kudos until me meet again!"}
{"text":"Completely different than the Basil's that I remember. Very pub like, clean and friendly staff. 2$ Miller and PBR's every day. M thru F happy hours 4-6p with 1/2 priced appetizers.        Came for brunch on a Sunday AM with the family. Had Chicken and Waffles, Eggs Benedict and French toast. All were great. I hear the redneck egg rolls are awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have not ordered anything that was not delicious! You always get plenty of food and the staff are the best!  This place is also great for watching sports as there are a ton of TVs inside, Bloody Mary Bar on Sundays, and a nice little patio space with TVs outside as well!"}
{"text":"Just fantastic. Our family of 5 walked in there and was immediately greeted and sat at a booth to acomodate our crew. Our server quickly came over, got our drink order and recommend us an appetizer. She was knowledgeable about the beer menu and recommended a beer that I enjoyed. Our food came out quickly and she was attentive to our table bringing us more drinks and napkins before we had to ask. I definitely recommend the tomato/cucumber side, it's probably one of the best homemade side dishes I've had in a while. I highly recommend this place and will be back when we're back in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem near OMB and Sugar Creek Brewing. If you blink you might miss it, so keep your eyes open. TVs on every wall and good selection of beer. Service was on point. Heard good things about the fried fish sandwich, so I ordered that. It did not disappoint. It was served on a high quality bun with pickled slaw, a house made pickle and tarter sauce. Probably one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had. The fries were hand cut and delicious. All of that for only 8 bucks.  I hope this place survives, cause it's easy to miss and they weren't very busy for a Saturday night. They're working on opening a patio, so I'll definitely be back to check that out."}
{"text":"Prices-GOOD Food- PRETTY DARN GOOD  Drinks- GOOD  Based on others reviews we decided to stop in on Sunday and avoid having to cook! From the outside you would just think it would be your ordinary Pub but oh boy what a treat once you actually taste the food!Ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes Blackened Barbalo Wings Boom boom shrimp tacosShredded Pork tacos and the BIG FISH sandwich All items were DELICIOUS! Hats off to the Chef! Definitely go check them out."}
{"text":"Had a good meal here. Owner is Greek so the menu features several Greek staples. As others point out, there are plenty of tv's and not a bad seat in the house for those so inclined. I had the classic comfort food of meat loaf, mashed potatoes with gravy and collards. Parking was ample and free in dedicated lot. The feel was comfortable and neighborly. Friendly staff. Good draft beer selection with several locals. Would recommend."}
{"text":"What an awesome find!!! I have to give credit to my boyfriend otherwise I would have no idea about this spot. But I think we have found our go to spot!   The space is so welcoming and cozy. I feel like it's a small town bar which you don't find often in bigger cities. There are tons of tvs so plenty of viewing spots for games! It's definitely on the smaller side but it adds to the homey feel!   The food was impressive for what you would expect at a pub! A lot of homemade, delicious food! We started with the queso (homemade) and it was sooooo cheesy, I mean you can never go wrong with cheese! I got the chicken salad sandwich (homemade, again) and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken salad was awesome, and I'm a stickler for chicken salad, it has to be really good for me to enjoy it and this one was so worth it! The buffalo chicken was amazing too! And another meal I'm used to getting when out, and this was by far one of the best I've tried! The buffalo sauce was perfect, had the smallest amount of kick so that you could really enjoy the buffalo taste without burning up!   Cocktails were good too. Nice wine pour and the drinks were nice and strong! AND they have tonsssss of drink specials throughout the week. Definitely check those out!   I can't wait to come back for a game or a low key night to have some drinks and try some more of the super extensive, delicious menu!"}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience at the restaurant  and been well taken care of. Food is great but the wings are definitely my favorite. There is a tv in any direction you look so it's great for game day. Good beer selection and service is better than anywhere I've ever been. New patio is a great addition just in time for fall. I will suggest anyone to go try this place out!"}
{"text":"I hate to be the party pooper of all these 5 star reviews but I don't see what is so special here.  I've been driving by this space for a while. I've seen restaurants come and go from this spot and while I am happy to see a restaurant finally open beyond 3pm in this space, I still think they have some flaws to work out.  The place is a sports bar. There are TVs on every wall. There's booth, table, bar and pub table seating. There's 2 tables outside the entrance for the outdoor feel. It's located in a small strip mall on Old Pineville Road that you would probably blink and miss as you drove by.  First off, I was hoping for some local draft beer options but they only had 2 selections of OMB and a Dales Pale ale which is sort of NC. The rest were Goose Island (owned by Anheuser Busch), Angry Orchard Cider, and Great Lakes and maybe one or two others. OMB is just around the corner from this place--withing walking distance!. It would be nice if they offered something you couldn't get on this side of town....NoDa, Birdsong, D9?  The menu is broad with mostly pub food and handful of entrees. They have a large selection of wings flavors and offer 3 flavors of grilled wings.   My friend and I started out with chips and queso as an appetizer. It was ok but again it was bar food.  We both order wings. She ordered Firecracker and I ordered Firecracker and Stinger hoping one of them would be spicy. While the chicken was great, neither flavor was spicy and we couldn't even tell them apart. There seemed to be a slightly sweet sauce with one or two chili flake flavor to the sauce. The other sauce was unnoticeable from the other. The ranch dressing that we did not order was actually good. Blue cheese was just ok and there were only 6 small pieces of celery.  While the staff was great and very appreciative of us stopping in, I think this is far from a 5-star place.  If you're looking for a neighborhood pub then this is a great place. But the one problem is it's not in any real neighborhood. The only things in walking distance are other businesses and a few hotels.    Still, I hope they do well here because as I've said, I've seen so many restaurants come and go in this space."}
{"text":"My hubby always gets the Big Fish  sandwich.  But tonight we switched it up.  I got it w  (really great fries) He got the black & blue burger.  Yummm  The table next to us got the \"new\" Ming Wing flavor, In on fried and then chard.  They were served w the best blue cheese, for a Pub we are always amazed at how homemade the food taste. Their ranch dressing is awesome too.  $3 Yuengling  Friday  We've come for happy hour to from 4 to 6 and then again from 9 to 11 appetizers are half price.    Good service, and if something's not right, they'll take care of you."}
{"text":"We were staying near the airport in Charlotte over night due to an early morning flight to the Caribbean the next day so of course, I used Yelp to find this delicious, unassuming spot. It was a Friday night and I was so worried it would be super busy, but to our surprise it was only about halfway filled and we got seated immediately. Some of the items I saw in Yelp photos were not on the menu, like the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers (sigh) but there were plenty of other delicious options. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was one of the best ones I had ever had! It was obviously hand breaded and cooked to perfection. They make their own dressings and the blue cheese dressing was to die for!!!!! I smothered my chicken sandwich in it. So good! My husband got a burger and thought it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Very decent prices, a full bar and lots of sports on the multiple TVs. Good for kids too! So sad we live 2 hours away!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today with a couple of my lunch partners.  I ordered the fried green tomato appetizer and the $8.75 Thursday lunch special- Grecian Chicken with green beans and a sweet tea.  The only negative is that there's simply too much food on those plates!  After the green tomatoes, I could barely make a dent in my meal and had to take it home.  The sweet tea was delicious, the server was totally on point and the inside is that ubiquitous light grey color complete with televisions all around and a full bar.  They serve weekend brunch that looks both tasty and reasonably priced so I'll be back on Sunday to give that a try  :-)"}
{"text":"On Sunday morning, as I was driving around lost, I happened to turn around in the parking lot of Old Pineville Premium Pub.  The outside looked interesting and after pulling up this place on Yelp, the food looked legit.  Tonight, I made my return to O.P.P.P to try it for myself and it's very good.    We started with the fried green tomatoes and a few beers.  Any place with a large local beer selection cheap is alright by me.  I had the steakhouse burger and it was cooked perfectly.    I could see enjoying a few beers while watching basketball this week"}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise for bar food! Walked in not expecting much but the blackened barbalo wings and chicken pita were excellent!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite new local spots! A hidden gem, great wings and food selection. Has become a regular stop for my wife and I. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After trying out their food at Three Spirits a few times, I finally made it into the restaurant. It's a well laid out space with a nice dining room for a restaurant of its size. I can't comment on the drinks since I stuck to lemonade last night, but the food was great. I got the Light Rail Burger, which was juicy and had fresh ingredients on it. If you get a sandwich, make sure you get the homemade chips. They are delicious and it's not often a side dish at a place is such a tasty part of the meal. My friend got the Mediterranean salad and she let me have a little bit and it was good as well.   Good location, good prices, and tasty food will definitely bring me back."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place was here and was pleasantly surprised. Great beer selection. Had the garlic parm and Buffalo wings which were delicious and perfectly cooked. Charisma was our waitress and she was super fantastic."}
{"text":"Service was great as was the food! Had the Gyro dinner and the fried green tomatoes! Loved it all"}
{"text":"This must be a brother location for Glenway Premium Pub! The food is amazing. I loved the Baja Fish Wrap. The Boom Boom shrimp is equally amazing! The burgers are some of the best. You can't go wrong at either location. Make sure you try this eatery! You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Finally a local spot that has good food and drinks that won't break the bank! I've wanted to try the premium pub for awhile and this past Friday night we made it happen.  The bar wasn't busy at all, which I found a little weird for a Friday night, but I was completely fine with it.  I think the hardest part about dinner was trying to pick a dish, everything looked really good! All the food we got was really good and not expensive at all. Drinks aren't cheap, but the have great beer specials if you're a beer drinker.  Overall, we really enjoyed our visit at premium pub and will return soon along with recommending it to everyone."}
{"text":"I left the restaurant with mixed feelings. I did not feel welcomed, but my food was amazing.   I ordered the blackened shrimp salad, but subbed salmon, added cranberries and avocado with Italian dressing. Salmon was cooked perfectly! Salad was great. Had vodka and soda to go with it! No problems on this side at all.  My problems came with service. Amelia B was my bartender. I'm not sure what the problem was because she was very energetic, conversational, and attentative to (what appeared to be) regular customers at the bar. This was my first time in this establishment. She offered me NOTHING. Not even a menu. I had to ask for everything I needed and wanted. When my glass was empty, she did not offer another drink, I had to ask for it, even though, I heard her offer other people 2nd, 3rd and 4th drinks. I put money in the jukebox and tried to break the ice by asking her what kind of music she likes, that didn't work. Still no conversation from her, she went right back her regulars, as if I was not a paying customer. I ate my entire meal with no napkins. I decided against asking for any because I felt like I was a bother at this point. I even had to tell her to take my card, because it did not appear that she was going to come cash me out after she brought my check (that I had to ask for). No dessert was offered, she never asked how was my food, did I need more dressing, was my salmon cooked well enough. NOTHING. Lastly, when she dropped my card back off to me, of course,  she did not invite me back. Very poor service.  I'm not sure in what manner I was profiled, but Amelia showed no interest in taking care of me like her regular customers."}
{"text":"I was in town for business when I stopped in here for lunch. It was so good I came back for dinner!! I got the meatloaf sandwich and fried green tomatoes for lunch and the SoLo Sandwich for dinner!! Both were amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is a good little hope in the wall in an unexpected area. A friend recommended it, so I scheduled a happy hour here.   They have half price appetizers from 4-6pm Monday-Friday which is awesome. We got the tenderloin tips and the chicken skewers. Both were good, but I liked the tenderloin tips more. The tomato cucumber salad and sun-dried tomato sauce that the chicken skewers came with were pretty good, but the chicken itself wasn't special.   The drinks were cheap and we were there on a Wednesday when everything on tap was $1 off.   They have tons of TVs all around, so this is a great place to come watch any sporting event.   The one disappointing thing was that the service wasn't that great. It often took a while for someone new to get served and to get refills.   All in all, I think this is an underrated bar with surprisingly good food. I would come back and try a burger next time."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Charlotte. A friend and I stopped here for dinner on whim...a whim called Yelp which recommended it!  They had great food and drink specials, and after looking at the menu I realized they have specials every day--so you're not going to break the bank getting some dinner.  I went with the tacos, which were the Tuesday deal: $5.95 for two tacos with chips and salsa. I did the grilled chicken, with chilli lime and pickled purple cabbage and the fish taco with cucumber mango salsa, basil and lime. Both were so well cooked and presented. I don't think anything was left on my plate. Ingredients were tasty and fresh.  Everything on the menu sounded good--I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We needed to go somewhere that had the game on. We saw that this is a great game day spot (being from out of town we had no idea where to go) so we stopped in. Sat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers. Looked over the menu (HELLO daytime brung menu, thank you!!!) and ordered the bleu cheese chips and the wings. Both really good. I could have used more bleu cheese dressing but I made it work.   The staff was very nice. Not hovery but did a nice job keeping our glasses full. They offer a bloody mary bar at least today they did (Saturday) and they also had $3.50 mimosa. I did not see which champagne they use which can really make or break a mimosa. Take your chances and try one.   We then moved out to the patio to smoke a cigar to celebrate our win over IA State. Woohoo! Nice patio. TV's (4) and they will offer to change the channel to whatever you want to watch.   WE wish this place was in our hometown. We can't find not act is decent. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"The wings are high quality. Some of the apps(black and blue chips and loaded nachos) are a miss. The service with our visit tonight was the worst. It started off fine enough. But then our waitress was busy chatting with other employees behind the bar. There were about five employees that I could see and there were only five patrons. Someone did come around and asked how everything was-and the wings were tasty. But we waited a long time for the bill and it was not our server who got it for us. Then we put the card with the bill and waited about 6/7 minutes- watching the employees talk about yoga and their body types for that time, hoping they would glance over and come get our check so we could go. After waiting I got up and took it to the bar where no customers but several employees were. The woman behind the bar became upset that I brought the check over. I waited and was watching a game above the bar and then watched her walk away from me over across the restaurant to our table and set it down. Wow! SHE REALLY SHOWED ME! Definitely a normally relaxing place to get high quality wings and things. But this interaction took the place down a lot. Hopefully the management can work with their staff to train them how to do their job."}
