{"text":"The service is ok at this location. I sat at the bar and ate, so I always had the bartender at my service. Besides that, I think there was only 1 or 2 other servers (a little after lunch)  The food is pretty good. As always, I recommend the habenero salsa (you gotta ask for it, the standard salsa is average). I havent eaten anything at this location, but the other ones have good food. I got the pork street tacos at the 2 other locations and they were consistantly good.  As far as the booze goes, I was somewhat impressed. The bartender knew quite a bit about the different tequilas and they even had my favorite one, Cruz Tequila! mmmmmm. I had a standard margarita with Cruz and it was tasty. Not bad drink specials  I would recommend it if youve never been"}
{"text":"Decent food and a fun atmosphere.  Good for casual lunch."}
{"text":"I've always like this place, but we went last Tuesday and had the worst possible experience from a service standpoint.  The fact that I've always liked it is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.  Our server would disappear for 30-45 minutes at a time, come back with the wrong order, and disappear again without fixing the order.  I finally had to tell her that we were not pleased, and she tried to tell us she was new.  I am very tolerant of new servers, but this girl spent most of her night chatting with a couple guests that were clearly her friends.  The initial mistakes with our orders weren't a big deal, but failing to fix them and disappearing again while chatting up her friends for over half an hour showed us she really did not care about us, or her tip.  Do yourself a favor if you go there and don't sit in Gretchen's section.  Her failures and subsequent disregard to amend the situation were not a result of being a new server; they were the result of being a rude person."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here because of a recommondation.  Looking from the outside, the looks attractive because of the outdoor seating.  Upon entering, we were greeted immediatley.  We were asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside and we chose to dine inside the restaurant because it was too hot.  My problem eating inside is that the music is too loud.  It's very difficult to converse when the volume is turned up to the max.  My friend's father asked our waitress to lower the volume so we can talk, but we didn't notice the difference.  Oh well.  On with the food.  We were provided with chips and salsa and I was dissappointed.  The salsa was bland and too runy.  I believe Chevy's salsa taste better than this.   The food is standard tex mex restaurant menu and prices.  I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good and tasty.  I was so full that I was unable to finish it.  My wife ordered the the shrimp quesidilla and it was okay.  My friends enjoyed their food, but nothing to knock us of our feet.  As I wrote earlier, other than the chips and sales everything else was ok. Nothing to call home about, but also not worth complaining about either.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and the ambitance is very lively.  Overall...if you want tex mex, nachos and maragaritas...The Salty Senorita is the place for you."}
{"text":"For a nice Saturday afternoon lunch, we decided to give this Salty location a try.  Perhaps because we were there on an afternoon, the place wasn't very busy at all....so, we had pretty good service.  We were a little surprised that you have to pay for the chips & salsa.  Yes, they're good, but aren't they typically complementary?   Our food orders ranged from chicken nuggets to mini-burgers to chicken chipotle tacos and pulled pork tacos with the coca-cola sauce.  No complaints from us.  The food was good, our server was on the ball and no problems parking.  As far as price ... yeah, it was a little much.  Perhaps a lunch menu with lower prices would have been nice.  Our bill was just about $50 for the 5 of us (remember, we had 2 kid meals at $5 each), so it was a little more than we like to spend for lunch.  Overall, it was a nice lunch, but we probably won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to all the valley Saltys, but choose to review this one as it is the one I most frequent due to the proximity to my house.  First off, I learned early in my Saltys experience that this isn't really a place to go for good eats.  Mediocre at best.  I gave everything a chance and it's all just OK...nothing stands out, except for the habanero salsa that you have to specifically ask for when served chips and salsa (that you have to pay for, wtf?)   Probably one of the hottest in the valley, I absolutely love it.  The actual chips are pretty good too, when they're consistent.  This particular Saltys quickly went the same route as its brethren, catering to 20 somethings (which I am)  looking for some ass (which I don't really mind, but just giving you an idea)  I know it's East Mesa, but it almost has a Scottsdale'y feel to it, especially on Fri and Sat nights...and that's why I kinda like it I think.  It's a good place to people watch without having to go to Old Town, or even Mill for that matter.  It's also a great place to day drink with cheap-ish beer.  Better than Dos Gringos in my opinion...not as uh, dirty feeling?  Don't like it at all as a restaurant, but as a local watering hole, it's not bad."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe this restaurant even garnered the three-star average it has right now. I'm still mad at them for the AWFUL service we got recently. It was my second visit there, and I only went because my friend is new in town and wanted to try it (my first experience there was not great, but not as bad as this one).  The Good:  Yummy food. Not spectacular, but their queso dip and fajitas were tasty. They needed to be, because it took a really long time to get them, as well as our drinks.  The patio is gorgeous, owing mostly to the restaurant's surroundings in Old Town Scottsdale. The people-watching is fun, and they've done a cool cantina twist on shabby chic outside with an ocean theme and festive lights.   The Terrible:  We were seated in the north forty on the patio, for starters, which didn't help our service because as far away as we were from the other patrons, we were ignored by the servers as well as the manager.   Wait... it's no excuse that we were apparently sitting in the blind spot of the restaurant, because on my first visit there, we were right in the middle of everything and the service was still bad.  Things started off promising with a wisecracking server who seemed on top of things, joked around with us, and got our orders pretty quickly.   Then the wheels fell off. It took at least 15 minutes to get two simple drinks (my friend ordered a mixed drink and I had a soda, so our orders weren't complicated). We would've asked where our drinks were but no one, came to the table. After the drinks eventually arrived, the queso dip (an appetizer) took forever, and my friend went to ask where it was.  You'd think after he actually left the table to ask about things that the service would've improved, but instead our empty drinks were ignored and we weren't sure if our dinner orders had even gone through because we waited another half hour.  Finally my friend motioned to the manager and explained (politely) what was going on and that we had a movie to catch in Tempe. The manager made sincere-sounding apologies, telling us he wanted us to have a great experience and that he would make adjustments to the bill. \"I think you guys will be very happy,\" he told us.   I've worked in restaurants before, and once a table is unhappy enough that they seek out a manager, efforts should be made to make sure the customer leaves on a good note. Even if they're not completely satisfied, they're at least not angry.  But when the bill came (after much more waiting on our additional drinks and the bill itself), the manager had taken off 20%. Seriously. My friend then told me that before I'd gotten there, it had taken the staff a good ten minutes to seat him, and it wasn't busy, so he just had to stand there feeling like a goon. The place was maybe 1/4 full...  Cute place, and it's in a good area. The food was decent and even better as leftovers. However, they have a lot to work on, service-wise."}
{"text":"Contrary to their website and my hotel's staff, their Late-night HH does not start until 11pm!!!  Don't be tricked like I was tonight.  The food is not worth the price I had to pay.    I found the bartender to be a bit condescending, too.  Call me a prude or whatever but at almost 40 years of age, I prefer not to be called \"dar-lin\" every time the bartender addressed me.  The first couple of times was cute but after that, UGH!  It was a slow night and I was one of only a handful of customers.  I was addressed a LOT!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used a Groupon here, what a disappointment!   Glad we didn't pay full price for our meal. First of all you have to pay for the chips and salsa, really. The salsa had no taste whatsoever. Our server then brought us the habanero salsa, not even hot and it didn't have any flavor either. To top it off, we were charged extra for it.   My meal was a chicken chili relleno, all I could taste was chicken no flavor at all.  My husband had a chicken fajita burro and he said it was just ok.   Our server was great, kept our drinks and chips refilled."}
{"text":"You know a place is good if you can sit in your casual weekend outfit and drink margaritas for 8 hours. This place is good, then, and I know because I've done just that. The patio is always packed and has a good crowd. The food is just OK (i think it's too salty and processed) but the endless chips and roasted salsa is exactly what you need to accompany a cold margarita."}
{"text":"It really pains me to write this review because I had such high hopes for this place.  My family was visiting from out of town and they spotted this restaurant, which looked kind of cool. They were dying for some good Mexican food.   When we walked in the front door there was no hostess to greet us.  We were told by the bartender to find a seat and we'd get a menu.  The place was loud and unorganized, which was surprising because it was a Sunday evening and they were not busy.  We ordered a few things from the menu, only to be told that they were out...no rice either.  The service was mediocre at best and the food was below average in taste and quality.  Wouldn't recommend going there."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt the worst dining experience I've ever had. Went there with 8 people on a Wednesday night. Extremely slow service. Food served cold. Four of us ordered tacos and they dropped them off at the end of the table and had to serve ourselves. I'll be surprised if I don't contract e-coli from the cold food. Zero stars. The manager blamed everything on just opening two weeks ago. The old location was good. I don't think this place will be in business very long. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The food is no harm, no foul and the margaritas are fine although would be a lot better if they served them in a margarita glass instead of a plastic soda cup.  Things are overpriced because of the location and you need to sit outside as indoors brings nothing to the table.  The crowd is a bit cheesy although that could have been due to the particular night we were there.  Overall there are probably better places to head to especially if you are looking for mexican food."}
{"text":"On a business trip - ate here last night. Horrible Horrible place. Sluggishly SLOW and LOUSY service and $160 later - me and my buddies wonder why we ever went there in the first  place. There were probably not more than 15 people on a Wednesday night. Yet Drink orders were forgotten at the bar for 30 mins and all mixed up. Waitress didn't know one drink from the other. Nachos had no seasoning. Grilled Mahi tacos are great as long as you're O.K with a side helping of hair strands."}
{"text":"I love this place for its rockin' salsa and cheese dip.  The tacos are OK but a great deal at happy hour.  Great patio too."}
{"text":"Met some friends out.  The burrito was marginal, even for a bar.  Our waitress even admitted she wasn't really paying attention as we gave our order."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour with good drink and food prices. I always notice the restaurants that give you only good prices on food or only good prices on drinks, which is understandable but come on, just discount a few popular apps to go with those drink specials! Anyway, my favorite thing here isn't even the Happy Hour, though, it's brunch. The French toast with the agave maple syrup is sweet, heavenly perfection, and the pancakes are awesome too, especially the pineapple or coconut. The Potbelly burrito is definitely big enough to split, and goes nicely with a bloody Maria or two!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday morning/lunch time, the place was dead..and yet it still took the server 15 minutes to greet us.  As a business that strives on alcohol, I would imagine the servers should be a little older and knowledgeable about the alcohol.  Sadly, our server had to be only 18 or 19 and had no idea about the drinks our group was asking for \"hold on let me go ask the bar what that is\" As for the food...absolute garbage for what we payed.  I don't like dumb ditsy servers and  awful food.  It makes it even worse when the music is so loud we have to yell at each other to talk.  I just wasn't into it, everything tasted like \"well\"...just a dirty cheap place.  My mother-in-law asked to talk to the manager after we waited 45 minutes on our food.  We never got his name but he straight up did not care and just said unless something was obviously wrong with our food when we got it, nothing could be done..and he walked away.  well..okay then..but never again!"}
{"text":"Saltys does it again! Even though it was a little slow in there still had fun with the staff! Diego was very helpful with tequila and since they were so slow the staff was hanging around the bar and got to hae some good times with them. Staff here is always upbeat and friendy. Always love coming to this place no matter if they are dead or busy! Great \"cheers\" feel"}
{"text":"Where to begin.   Came here with my wife, her parents and the friend that recommended the Salty Senorita. We started by getting a table inside, and besides the college-bar blaring music, it was Free Manicure Day. I am not making this up. We sat at a table for 5, and to my left was a woman giving manicures in a booth. Hello? Health Department? So it was too noisy for my wife's Dad because of his hearing aid. It was too noisy for me too, as I am 20+ years out of college, and need to hear myself think before I speak.   We got a table outside with bar stool height seats, which was cool. Freezing to be polite. There were propane tree heaters, which worked for the people near them, but I was not one of those. Happy hour, $3 for Corona, $4 for Margaritas. My wife decides to get top shelf Margaritas. They go for $9 each. Nothing happy about  that.   Chips and salsa. Best part of the evening, which is a bad sign. The chips were the thinnest I have ever seen, crispy, salty and warm. Salsa was smoked style, medium-hot spicy and very good. But after eating all the chips you can stand, you got to get some real food, right?   I ordered the 'dos' items, as in uno, dos, tres, from the menu. Chicken taco and chicken enchilada. Beans and rice go with. This stuff would make a Mexican turn in his green card and walk home in shame. Totally no taste, no life just filling. Opposite of a Bud Light, [does not] taste great [is not] less filling. The other diners at my table were equally uninspired by their food,   Wait staff was OK. And I second Tiffany B.'s opinion on the eye candy of Scottsdale fake boobs. Seems this is where all the Hooters waitresses come to party. Or Hooters waitress candidates."}
{"text":"COMPLETE AND UTTER TRASH WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD AT ANY ESTABLISHMENT AND I WOULD UTTERLY RECOMMEND TO NO ONE EVER COMING HERE!!!!!!  Where do I even begin! We got there and noone greeted us on a Sunday Afternoon for the Giants Game which we where there because a few friends where in town from San Francisco, CA visiting and they had SF flags all over.... THEY DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE GAME ON OR THE CHANNELS... can anyone say a JOKE!  NEXT we where just there for a few drinks and some food so we ordered our drinks and our food and the first waitress we had wasn't horrible but definitely in short attendance to the tables need and was rarely seen while glasses hung out on the table empty or practically empty.  We where then switched waitresses to the new waitress who I guess has won the award for WORST WAITRESS IN SCOTTSDALE MULTIPLE TIME or maybe it was just the staff overall at Salty who knows? She asked if we needed anything and I personally ordered a round of 5 \"house tequila shots\". This was my first time ever being at salty and I was just ordering off the happy hour menu that was in effect. The waitress proceeded to leave and come back about 15 minutes later from the bar that is not 10 feet from our table to inform us that the house shots are pre made and does not have tequila?? I proceeded to ask what it was made with... WOW SHE HAD NO IDEA LUCKILY my friend who had been there a few times knew that it was with flavored vodka ... NO BIGGIE moving on in life RIGHT?  Proceeded to just ask her to bring us 5 of those and that would be fine.... 20 minutes go by and I see our waitress at another table? I called her over and asked about our missing shots? she informed me that she was there to RE RE VERIFY that we wanted the shots for the going on 3rd contact we had had about ONE SET OF SHOTS!!! THAT ARE PRE MIXED!!!!!! I slightly quizzed her on the issue and asked if she saw anything wrong with the situation? She informed me not at all and I asked if her manager would because I would love to explain it to him.   IT GETS GOOD HERE!!!  SO the manager walks up with what I can only describe as a cocky and I could care less attitude ( YOUR A MANAGER IN \"INDUSTRY\" SERIOUSLY!!!!)! Proceeds to ask what had hapenned so I started to explain the situation while being constantly interrupted by him informing me I was wrong or that there was just NO WAY POSSIBLE that it had taken over 30 minutes to get said shots!!! NEVER AT SALTY...   THE BIG ISSUE is about 1/2 way through the explanation the manager starts LAUGHING!!!.. i mean seriously your in CUSTOMER SERVICE.. what are you going to do when your SERVICE ... GETS YOU ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMERS TO SERVICE???? who knows but I proceeded to ask  \"Are you laughing at me and about the situation?\"  his response- \" Yes, I think its quite the humorous situation\"  I proceeded to ask if you enjoys laughing at situations where his restaurant completely screws up and asked for HIS MANAGER  HIS MANAGER'S NAME WAS DOUG.... he wouldn't tell me his last name obviously I wouldn't either if I knew I had reviews about my restaurant headed to yelp!! HE Walked up to the table THREW the check on the table and said I heard we are having some issues! My buddy tried explaining the situation and was ABRUPTLY CUT OFF and we where then informed that \"WE WHERE ASSHOLES AND TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HIS RESTAURANT\"... now YOUR A GM AND YOUR CUSSING OUT CUSTOMERS BRINGING TO LIGHT THE HORRIBLE SITUATION YOUR SERVICE LEVEL IS AT IN YOUR STORE SERIOUSLY??? I then walked up to try and rectify the situation on the way out because I felt that the wait staff had OBVIOUSLY portrayed us as just being bad patrons! He proceeded to RUDELY TURN ME AWAY AGAIN WITH MORE LANGUAGE  AT this point I had had enough I walked outside to my group of friends and they all agreed that NONE OF THEM would EVER BE GOING TO SALTIYAGAIN because of this service.. by the way we had a group of about 8 people and had more on the way GOOD JOB SALTY!   SO IN THE END SERVICE IS HORRIBLE THE SHOTS WHICH WE FINALLY GOT AFTER GETTING OUR CHECK TOSSED AT US/OUR TABLE WHERE SUB PAR WEAK AND TASTED HORRIBLE!!! The food WAS DRY AND NON IMPRESSIVE and the Happy hour was SUB PAR for the location... In a State / city / bar scene where Tequila Cantinas / and MEXICAN BARS ARE VERY PLENTIFUL I WILL NEVER EVER and when i say EVER i mean EVER BE going to ANY SALTY SENORITA ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! and I will tell everyone I know to never go there as well. I wouldn't want to put anyone I know through this CRAPPY of a dining experience... THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT!!!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service, tasteless burrito,  missing ingrident in food, drinks came more than half way into the meal which by the way came about the same time as the apetizer..... I still didnt get my napkins. I feel like my mexican friends can do better."}
{"text":"3 stars for food quality 3 starts for location (old town but away from the action) 3 stars for margaritas that have a good mixer. I can hardly taste the tequila.  4 stars for service. Server was nice and accommodating. She came by the table to check on us a lot.  2 stars for parking availability. A valet? Really? There must be some kickbacks to the management from this gig.  3 stars for a dated decor with a worn out 4 track VHS tape of 80's and 90's hits playing over UHF TV. And, if you can remember what those letters stand for then your older than me.  You want to have your friends meet you here for a drink  and app before going somewhere else. Otherwise, your hangin' with the college session drinkers."}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief...  PRO'S: - Walking distance from the hotel - Decent Happy Hour specials - The chips & salsa - We never got charged for ALOT of things  CON'S: - Sometimes crowded with douches and debutantes - Watered down $1 shots - So-So food overall - WHERE THE HELL IS OUR WAITRESS"}
{"text":"Huge out door deck right on Scottsdale Rd.  Great Margaritas!!!! decent Mexican but it's more of a place to drink than it is to eat.  Decent Bloody Mary too!  Lunch would be fun here!"}
{"text":"I miss the old Salty Seniorita! Why? The new location's margaritas are half the size (even though the glass is made to look big) so, in effect, they are double the cost. Our bill was twice what it used to be for the same amount of alcohol. Also miss the slushy margaritas! I was excited to check out the new location but feel no desire to return. A financial rip-off!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't worth the price.  Their red sauce was like tomato paste & I couldn't figure out why a cantina would blare rock/blues music?!  The nachos were good though."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were super tasty!!! Servers were very attentive and polite. My friend had a burrito and liked it a lot. I highly recommend the fish tacos. They were outstanding. Much better than I expected. Unfortunately they charge two bucks for chips and salsa. It was a good stop for a nice lunch outside. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"These guys don't give a sh*t about their customers. My group has holding our events here for years just out of tradition, but we're going to be choosing a new venue. The bartenders here are such douche bags. If you complain about one thing, they'll give you an attitude. They'll even refuse to serve you or intentionally stall if you give them any trouble. It's the same thing the last two times we went. And the crazy thing is that the managers don't care either. As long as people keep giving them money for bad service, they're never going to change.  Food is good though lol."}
{"text":"We walked in just behind three ladies on 1/17, around 7:00 PM...  We stood around a few minutes when someone came to seat the ladies.  We were not acknowledged at that time and 5 minutes later we were still standing at the front - this while a guy was at the bar to the left wiping glasses and looking at us and several waitresses walked by.  Another couple of minutes passed and we walked out.  We went next door and had great pizza.  Highly recommend skipping the Salty Señorita and grabbing pizza next door or going elsewhere where they care about customers and focus on service."}
{"text":"I came here during happy hour, so it was really inexpensive. The tacos, nachos and slides were pretty good..and for $10 I got 2 margaritas and 2 shots, so that is a good deal for sure. Had to take off stars though, because we were handed the most worked over, nasty menus. I asked the waitress what the deal was, and she said that someone left a stack of menus outside and they got rained on. So, instead of replacing them, they are still using them. It looks like they have been peed on and left in a port-o-potty to dry. Gross. Otherwise, had a good time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  They have good $1 tacos on Tuesday nights, but the service isn't always great."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends, and I felt like I was back in college at a college bar. Loud music, pretty people all checking each other out, cheap drinks (oooh,  my head) and deep conversations that went more and more awry as the evening wore on.   The food is not Mexican by a long shot. It has the right names, like taco, enchilada, burrito, but they must have left the taste back at the kitchen or something. Bland and blander. If the food has little taste, salt, pepper and hot sauce are not going to do much except make it salty, peppery and too spicy to eat.   Drinks were good. Generous too. We all caught up on what was happening in our lives, and what was not happening that we wanted to happen. I prefer the outdoor patio in front by the sidewalk. The chairs are bar stool height, and on the night I was there the propane space heaters were greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Happy Hour was awesome!  Great deals, and my margarita was loaded with alcohol.  The tacos are small, but pretty good, I recommend the chicken ones on happy hour.  Great atmosphere, great service, but would like to see cheaper prices for say the quesadilla and more tacos for the money (I think not on happy hour two small tacos are like $6 and the quesadilla is always about $9 and it's huge, doesn't make sense)."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here during the Iowa games and I sit at the bar so I guess that makes the differance.  I really enjoy watching the games here, everyone is so nice, although the servers don't seem as happy to be there as the rest of us but hey they had to get up at 8 on a Saturday morning so I don't really blame them as it's not their team.  I can't wait for this upcoming season so hopefully it will a great year!"}
{"text":"Everything about the new Salty's has already been said. Bad menu, slow service and way overpriced. My question to ownership is......how many more 1 star reviews are you going to accept before you listen to your customers? You have a great build out and location so why don't you bring back the original chef and menu before it all goes south?"}
{"text":"Ate there recently with the family. Ridiculous prices. Miniature servings. Black eyes peas advertised as beans and bones in my fish taco... Great experience"}
{"text":"Went here on Cinco De Mayo. I would think they'd be a little more prepared but the service was terribly organized. There was a pack of about 20 waitresses running around and except maybe 1 or 2 they were dumb as rocks. I know that's harsh but please, my reviews are generally pretty positive. We had probably 5 different waitresses, mainly because they didn't realize our table was already being waited by someone else.  They were advertising specials on Coronas, $10 for 5 bottles in a bucket. Sounded like a pretty good deal until they came back with CORONITAS-- so half the size of a Corona. We were able to laugh it off, but it was pretty sneaky and shady how they presented it.  The food wasn't really warm when it came out, either. I get that it's busy and it's a holiday, but I really don't want a cold burrito.  Never again-- unless I happen to be hammered."}
{"text":"I was visiting Old Town Scottsdale for Fiesta Bowl weekend and looking for a fun place to grab dinner with friends. The outdoor patio caught my eye (I'm from LA, I live for the outdoors). Almost every other place in the area had 4 stars on yelp so we just stumbled in without checking yelp's warnings. Big mistake #1. Big mistake #2 was ordering the shrimp and mango quesadilla. It sounds great but new rule - at a bar just stick with the safe food group - chicken. I usually love shrimp but the shrimp in this quesadilla did not taste fresh at all. The taste of it made me feel sick and after trying to pick at it and avoid the shrimp I gave up. I am not usually the complaining type but this was a different story. I needed to warn them to stop using this bad shrimp. Bad fish is no joke. So when the waitress came at the end of our meal I told her that I didn't think the shrimp was fresh. She looked at me almost concerned and replied \"you know next time you should just stop eating right away\" and here I thought she must be concerned for me getting food poisoning up until she added \"because that way it'll be more believable when you leave it on your plate\".   Wow! Really?!"}
{"text":"If I could give Salty Senorita a '0\" I probably would because it is terrible. I can only echo what the majority of reviews say: new Satly's totally lacks the good service, creative menu, and ambience of the old.   My recommendation: Don't bother! Visit another fine eatery in Scottsdale--there are many--all better than Salty's at this time. Maybe in the future Salty Senorita will regain its glory of old. But, for now, stay away."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good service and a nice atmosphere specially if you'rd trying to get out the heat.  When i first sat down I was never offered the customary chips and salsa that you get at EVERY Mexican restaurant. After ordering the waitress ask if i wanted chips and salsa for $2 more. WHAT???  I know the economy is in the toilet but next they are going to charge for napkins."}
{"text":"\"All roads lead to Salty\" is my husband's motto.  This place is great.  Great drinks, especially the margs, and food is pretty decent.  Staff is great.  Very friendly.  We hang out here all the time.  See you at the bar!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to this restaurant when I moved here a year ago. The atmosphere is unique and the happy hour drink specials are great.   However, the less I drink there, the more I notice how bad the service is. It takes forever to get someone to come to your table when you first get there. Then after that, it takes quite a while for them to come back Also, our servers were not nice. You could tell they didn't want to be there. And that happens about every time I go.   Besides the service, the food is mediocre.  I will be looking for a new place with cheap drinks and better service."}
{"text":"Came out with the wife and mom to watch the Iowa-Ball State game, and if you are an Iowa fan, this is a good place to catch a game. Lots of regulars and former Iowans.  Pros: Many TVs. Good salsa, very smoky flavor.   Cons:  Many TVs lead to few conversations on any meaningful topic other than \"the TVs are too loud\" and \"I can't hear you.\" Maybe this explains the roughly 30 minutes we did not see a waitress. It can't be though, as she was busy talking to her friends. You know the type. Early 20s, ASU student, lots of tats and a few piercings. I may be getting old (late 30s), and have some piercings myself, but get over yourself and do your job. Most of us old farts don't really care about what happened at the awesome party you were at the night before; in a month, she probably won't either.  The chips soaked up every last ounce of oil. If you took a match to one, it would burst into flame. If you rubbed one on a piece of paper, you could see through the paper in roughly 2.4 seconds."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food.  All of us enjoyed our meal.  The waitress was fantastic.  Very attentive, very friendly.  What I didn't care for was the DJ.  He play some funky weird tracks.  More of club dance theme rather than a restaurant food theme.    Beyond that good place to eat if you want Mexican..."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for Mexican party food and beverages in a VERY LIVELY setting? Then head over to Salty Senorita, or as my preschooler calls it, \"the mermaid restaurant.\" It's usually noisy and the patio's always packed, but the food's solid (I like the fish tacos), the drinks flow easily and the guacamole is to-die-for.  An added bonus: people watching, both on the patio and along Scottsdale Road. Especially during spring training."}
{"text":"I used to love this place!  Then they starting SUCKING: 1) Went there on a Friday night with a bunch of out-of-towners and it turned out they had no ice for drinks.  We were not told this, just given drinks with no ice at 6pm outside in 110 degree temps.  No apologies.  Have you ever had a HOT (not even warm at that point) Malibu Pineapple?  Don't. 2) Got food poisoning here.  Granted, I ended up losing a few pounds from the whole ordeal, but overall, I probably would have passed on the experience, given the chance.  Bad. No. Don't."}
{"text":"The food is not exciting but it's a great spot after a Giant's spring training game.  It will be crowded with lots of fun loving people.  Their small street tacos are worth the price, but otherwise it is mostly a place for inexpensive, but ordinary, margaritas."}
{"text":"So finally, after 8 months of living in beautiful AZ,  I finally tried this festive Mexican restaurant/bar.  Seems like everytime I drove by, there's always a good crowd in the large, inviting patio.  I would have to agree with many of the previous reviews.  The service is good- very friendly. The drinks are nice and tasty. The food is OK, I've had better. The prices are decent, check out the happy hour for the most bang-for-your-buck.   Tip -try the blood orange Marg.  Tip- great place for day drinking!"}
{"text":"2- 3 STARS  I would not go there again to eat but maybe to have a drink and sit on the deck - maybe!  The hubby and I stopped in to sit down and discuss some business we were doing in the area. He was starving, and it was the first place I saw. I liked the look of the outdoor deck so I pulled over.  Parking was easy - thankfully. They have parking in the back. The deck was nice and looked like it would be a great place to party at night. They have huge palms towering over the outdoor seating area and bar.  And they thoughtfully had outdoor heaters scatter conveniently about. It was comfortable and inviting outside.  This is definitely a party place.   We sat outside to eat & talk and looked at the sparse menu - not much to choose from. The food was - well - it was edible. My husband said \"for Mexican Food, this stuff is bland\". He had nachos and a steak quesadilla . He eats Mexican Food a lot, so he knows what is good and what is not. This food was not good. I only had a boring salad. The food can be expensive. They have $9.99 Tacos on the menu, but luckily, we did not order them. I would not recommend the place for eating - maybe for drinking and hanging out on the deck.   Seating could be more comfortable. They have pub tables with wood stools outside and small wooden dinning tables and chairs inside - all wood, no cushion, no relaxing. They did have about ten booths with cushioned seats though. They have 2 bars: one outside and one inside. They are not very big, but they look great. This place has a lot of potential. Sadly though, it looks like someone has just let it go - food and all. Beware of the bathrooms. They are disgusting, and they even have writing on the walls.   I left there thinking of the center city bars & clubs I would find myself in during my college party days. This would be a good stop for a bar crawl but not for anything else in my opinion. It has a great deck though - right along Scottsdale Rd. It has great potential altogether and the service was good!   Our bill was $39.00 for 1 side salad, 1 nacho platter, 1 steak quesadilla, 2 beers & an avian water."}
{"text":"The people here are just rude (fellow patrons, the bartenders, the wait staff). Conceptually, I think the restaurant is in a great location with a decent menu (one star). But the people there suck. I had a bartender yell at me for going to her bar because there was a private party going on. Um, excuse me, there's no rope or sign up. How the f*** am I suppose to know?! Most of the female customers had attitude, too. I didn't have any firsthand encounters with them, but just people watching the scene while on a double date, we came to the conclusion we wouldn't want to hang out here as singles. The fresh made guacamole is worth a star, too, in case you're wondering how Salty Senorita got two stars."}
{"text":"This place did not have good service and the food was nasty ordered the fish tacos). Also went to use the restroom and yuck it smelled gross! The only people that I can see getting good service were the people sitting at the bar. I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Great environment, great bartenders... just an OK placeto dine. I'd go to 4 stars if I were reviewing \"a good time\", but as such, 3 stars have it. I would have to say the best food is their fish tacos, but I haven't tried everything on the menu... so give it a shot."}
{"text":"Awesome service, best service since we've been here. Thanks Rachel!! Much nicer than Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"Meh.  Went here for dinner with my wife recently.  We initially sat on the patio, but the music was ridiculously loud, so we went inside where the music was still ridiculously loud but we could actually somewhat understand what the other person was saying.  Please....turn down the music a bit!  Food was fair - soup portion was very large.  Burrito was average.  Drinks seemed decent.  My wife enjoyed the fact that they had Corona Light on draft.  We got the fried ice cream for dessert - nothing special, we've had way better.    Can't recommend them strongly for the food, and did I mention the music was blaring?  I guess if you're in a party mood this might be the place to come, but definitely not for a relaxed, casual dinner.  The Brat Haus next door is a WAY better option."}
{"text":"Great place for a few afternoon libations.  However, I would definitely stay away from the food next time..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving around looking at Christmas lights and stuff when Salty Senorita caught my eye. We walked up and the delicious smell was too good to pass up. The ambience is that of any open air sports bar, which isn't a complaint. I was actually surprised it wasn't more raucous. After looking over the menu I'd wished we'd gone for happy hour when the prices are much cheaper, but the total bill was still under $40 which is awesome considering all the drinks and food we got. I ordered the Chipotle Chicken burrito and my hubby had the Carne Asada burrito. Mine was delicious and spicy and I liked the Carne but my husband didn't so I had to drop a star. There was an awful lot of rice in his. My burrito was hot and spicy. I hate bland Mexican food. I was pleased but the place is far from perfect. They didn't ask us which sides we wanted. They just brought beans which didn't really bother me because that's what I would've ordered anyway. They had a good beer special, though. I'd definitely go back for a happy hour. I might have to find someone else to go with me."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for happy hour! Absolutely great for that purpose only! It has a very FL feel to it. You feel as if you are on the beach sippin WHATEVER'  we had plenty of drinks(which were made great for a happy hour. We also had everything food wise on the happy hour menu! Nachos & wings were the best! Def will come back for happy hour, only."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love, love, love this place but was kinda bummed by the service.   They have a fun and festive space, a great outdoor patio  and high energy dj that was rousing the crowd and spinning mash ups like they were facing the electric chair.    Food was decent but because I was driving in Sheriff Joe's county so I had to stick to wine and thats where service fell apart.  I didn't expect a world class wine list by any stretch, but I didn't expect the cute little bartender to act irritated out her mind and roll her eyes when I asked about wine by the glass.  I know its easier to pour a glass of wine then blend a top shelf margarita so I didn't really get the 'tude, but whatevs, we were on vacation and just trying to spend a little cash.  Bus boy was super nice and the bathrooms were clean and there is a decent sized parking lot so thats something.   I just wish they were nicer because we were sent there by a Diamondback player that rents my cousins house and highly recommended it as a fun place for three of the saltiest senoritas in the world."}
{"text":"Great tacos fun place to hang out. Party atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've boozed here a few times...but until a co-worker suggested we grab lunch there this afternoon, I never even thought about getting food there.  I'm a fan of their bar.  The margaritas are great.  The food was okay.  Nothing I'd write home about.  But I'd bet that my food would have tasted better if I was feeling buzzed from a marg (the Salty Seniorita is my favorite).  They have lunch specials that are $6.99 and the portions are a bit smaller than the bigger meals.  It takes a lot to fill me up, so the lunch special was a bit smaller than I would have liked...but I left satisfied."}
{"text":"Confession. It took me almost a year of living in Old Town to make it to Salty's.  This review is only on the drinks, since I didn't eat. I met up with a co-worker for a quick happy hour before my Friday adventures. Parking was kind of ridiculous, so I valet'd. I didn't have cash on me, but the dude was cool to let me hit him up on the way out.  Service was good. Drinks were strong, and cheap. Tons of servers in this place, so flagging someone down isn't really a problem.  The patio looks awesome, but it was so damn hot. Sitting inside with air conditioning really hit the spot.  I'd definitely come back. Seems like a cool place to go with a good group of people.   And although I didn't eat here, the food looked like your standard \"mexican\" bar fare. Can't be too bad, but can't be too good for you either. Classic. Ha."}
{"text":"Can you say $1 Tacos?!?!!? Great beer baskets! IF you're visiting definitely a eye catcher from the outside. Will go again!  Food: 3 Service: 3  Environment: 5 Price: 4"}
{"text":"I am picky about Mexican Food.  This place is ok but it is overpriced.  The steak burrito is pretty good and the salsa is ok (but not hot at all).  There are soooo many tools at this place who think that they are \"all that\".  I would never go here on a crowded weekend night.  Also, the only have bottled beer that is expensive.  I am a beer snob and the bottle is not the way to go, for me at least.  Ron B says it best, this is a college bar disguised as a restaurant.  Oh, they have lots of smokers on the patio, the chairs are not comfy and the tables are nasty."}
{"text":"Like many in Scottsdale, a patio with misters and margaritas is like catnip.  However, Salty clearly knows this to lure patrons in.  The food is below average, my friend almost puked on fish tacos.  They have a wide variety of margaritas..even one for $195. Really? You have to be pretty drunk and an idiot to drop that cash at this place for 1 drink. The patio is nice if you just want to drink Corona's or beers and the service is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican turned American bar with a great deck.  What more do you want, stay, drink, chill, enjoy.  Nothing mind blowing, but it's the deck that they're selling.  Pretty people chilling."}
{"text":"Top-notch during off hours and tool-shed during peak hours.  I've been here multiple times: morning, day, night, weekend, sunday mornings, et cetera. I've never had any issues here. The girls are cute (ASU slooties), but the dudes are tools. I get it. Don't let it dissuade your decision. The staff is great and very personable.  If you're lucky enough to go there on a Sunday morning, you might ask for a mimosa, however, you'll get a MANmosa (if you're a dude). No joke I ordered a mimosa and she came back with a giant glass and said, \"I could have put it in one of those cute flutes, but I figured this suited you better.\" Good call.   I visit this place regularly when I'm in town.   Cheers"}
{"text":"I sigh as a write this....we went for food. It wasn't very good. It wasn't bad, just boring, overpriced, and salty. I suppose the name of the restaurant should've been an indicator.  The pina colada was meh.  I wished I was either at a dive Mexican restaurant or somewhere like El Zocalo. Anywhere would've been better really.  It was irritating paying over forty dollars for two people for such a disappointing meal.  Next time I'll check Yelp first."}
{"text":"I went with a group of mostly 30 and 40-somethings to this Salty's and was SORELY disappointed. We waited about 15 minutes for our waiter to even give us the time of day, and then when he finally showed up at our table it took another 10 minutes or so to get a drink. And if you go to the webpage for this restaurant, they've got their awards from different sources right up front and center. \"Best Margarita!\" \"Best Margarita!\" Really? Because their ONE blender was broken, and the waiter told us that it was 'always broken'.   Funny though, for all the horrible service we were getting, the suspiciously too-young looking girls in low-cut tank tops were getting more then their fair share of attention from our waiter. Too bad too, because he probably would have gotten a better tip from us if we'd gotten the same service."}
{"text":"It was enduring the bitter cold of Chicago for the past three months that pulled me to this place. Driving along Scottsdale road to the hotel, I saw happy, tanned patrons drinking magaritas and eating guacamole - OUTSIDE! Really, the restaurant could've been called \"Salty Turds\" and the fact that there was a patio that I could sit on in the middle of February would have been enough for me.   The patio was packed at 6pm but the hostess was really great about keeping a lookout for a table and before we could finish our Coronas, we had a small table for two. The food was just okay. It didn't wow me, but I wasn't spitting it out in my napkin either. I was only in town for the weekend, and with so many cute places around Scottsdale, I wish I would've resisted the allure of the first patio I laid eyes upon and tried a place that would have food to match the ambiance."}
{"text":"I used to love Saltys but ever since they moved their restaurant sucks. We ordered the table side guacamole and it came to is premade and half empty. Their salsa wasn't up to par. They delivered my margarita in a short glass and tried to say it was the same amount of as a regular margarita. Seriously Saltys? This place was awesome before and now it's just crappy service trying to compete in old town."}
{"text":"Since I placed an order to-go over the phone one time and my burrito was pretty good and in tact, I decided to take hubbs to this place. We were craving some white-washed Mexican food. It seemed to take forever to get drinks, get order placed, get our entrees and to even pay to leave.   We asked the waiter to explain how big the tacos were (I believe one of the meals said 3 tacos, rice and beans). He kinda used his hands to demonstrate how big it was. Oh, okay, I thought, pretty decent sized. That would explain that the plate was around $15. Wrong. I get my tacos and they are super duper small. Real small. Good thing they came with rice and beans or else I would've still been starving. Mediocore tacos at best. What was I thinking, urgh. I apologized to my husband for the experience, we were $35 lighter and still hungry.  I think it's the decor that attracts young people here, especially on weekends and nights, it almost looks like a college dorm party. No thanks. \"It's like an overpriced Taco Bell\" were the words that came out of my mouth as we left the place.  Note: Why does it cost extra for chips & salsa at Mexican places now??"}
{"text":"I really only know the Taco Tuesday side of Salty Senorita's...and to know it is to love it. $1 tacos, $5 buckets o' beer. Boo-ya.   So here's how it goes: we all gather 'round one of the outdoor tables and order a bucket and the table-side guac (spicy, mind you). Then we order either the chicken or the steak tacos (I prefer the chicken), and then chat and eat and drink and maybe order another bucket and eat some more and chat and laugh. And it's a great evening.  I really can't speak to the regular food, but table-side guac gets 2 thumbs up from me, as do the chicken tacos. Delish. And also, their blended margies are great. I guarantee I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"First time going to Salty Senorita and it will be the last time unless it's just to grab some drinks for happy hour.  I'll start with the positives. Our waitress was really attentive even though we were with a big group and my wife seemed to like her margarita. That's it.  The food was as bad as i've eaten in recent memory. The chips seemed old and stale (salsa was pretty good though). I ordered the fajita burrito with red sauce and a $2.99 thimble of Guac on the side.   The food came out in about 3 minutes which should have been my first clue. The tortilla was rubbery, the red sauce tasted just horrible, and the steak had absolutely no flavor what so ever. The burrito was about 60% onions, 30% flavorless chewy steak, and 10% peppers.  To be fair.....my wife said her carnitas taco's were decent.   My advice would be to come for the drink but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"First, let me state that I probably will never go back to this business.  We went there this past Thursday night for a friend's birthday party.  Granted, we had a table/party of 20+, but right from the start, we had TERRIBLE service.  1 waitress for our table and she would only swing by every 20+ minutes.  Many of us actually had to get up and order our drinks from the bar because we never saw the waitress.  When it finally came time for the bill, the waitress gave us 1 receipt for everyone, a $500+ bill.  She refused to split it up and so it took us a very long time to pass the bill around one-by-one so everyone could figure out what we owed.  After everyone put down our credit cards and actually wrote out what we wanted charged to each card, it took another 10 minutes to get the waitress to pick up the bill.  After another 20 minutes, she finally came back with the cards and to our surprise, she charged the amount we wrote down PLUS 20% on each card.  With out asking.  The whole point of the cards was to split up the bill and allow us to choose our tips (which we had already figured in to the amount).  Example:  I owed $15 in food and drinks, so I wrote down to charge my card $20.  After this obvious error, the waitress was very pissed off about having to run the cards again, something that took another 20 minutes.  I went up to the manager to talk to him and explain the situation and how we all were now waiting over 1 HOUR just to cash out due to his waitress's mistake.  At the least he could do was comp. us a free beer or something.  At this suggestion, the manager (the tall, skinny white guy) got very angry and told us that IT WAS OUR FAULT and that we have been wasting his and his waitress's time and that we should have had 1 person pay for everything.  To top that off, the waitress was pissy about it,.  TL, DR:  terrible service, manager doesn't give a fuck.  Don't give this business your money."}
{"text":"I really like going to Saltys!  It has a really fun atmosphere and my friends and I have always had a good time.  We usually go for the drinks but have ate there.  I would say its just slightly better than average Mexican.  I dont expect to get gourmet Mexican when I go there just good ol' quesadillas, queso, and fajitas.  Happy hour is great here.  Like it a lot.  WIll return."}
{"text":"Drove past this place at least 30 times, but finally just popped in for a Happy Hour on Monday. Only tried two sliders for 3 bucks, but they had me wanting to try more. They were on sweet rolls, had a good thick slaw and chipotle mayo on them. Shredded chicken Tinga style was solid too in the tomato sauce. The margaritas don't use fresh juice, but were decent at 4 bucks. On Monday, the margs are supposed to be 1/2 price according to a giant banner, but nice bartender did not seem to understand the banner in front of her. Not a big deal, but after HH it would have been a big deal. Small TV's at the bar, but overall a good 45 minute stop."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a simple quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"It's an okay place. Menu is a bit odd and not ordinary. Menu is also over priced. Had appetizers and house margaritas with a friend today on a Thursday and the patio was busy but inside not so much and it was about 93 degrees out. Margaritas are now served in pint glasses vs the traditional glass which is a bit tacky for a Mexican place in the drinking business. Service was OK, a little slow at first.  I won't be racing back, but would go again if someone else really wanted to go. Preferably I'd go during happy hour when appetizers are 1/2 price and drinks a bit more reasonable because that was the only part of the menu that I found anything near normal Mexican as I know it.."}
{"text":"This place is pricey for what it is, but the food isn't bad by any measure.  The table-side guacamole is a nice touch and the salsa is tasty, but guacamole shouldn't cost you nearly $9.  The margarita menu is exhaustive, but again, very expensive.  Some are upwards of $12 for an average sized glass.  We ordered a pitcher of the basic marg, which was $26.  And to cut costs a bit, my date and I shared the 6 taco plate, choosing 2 for me and the other 4 for him.  They were, however, accommodating of my vegetarian diet, making me bean tacos (and the black and refried beans are both veg-friendly).  We might be back for happy hour, but probably not for a full meal.  You can get fairly tasty, greasy Mexican food elsewhere for a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"Unfortuantely there were no senioritas as advertised.  And if there were, they probably be salty.  The food was not very good.    I sure wished I wasn't here for work because then I probably would unleash the poor shakled tequila bottles.  Poor, poor bottles.    I had the cesar salad burritto, which wasn't very good.  I didn't follow my  own advice of never ordering food which has a combination of foods mixed together."}
{"text":"Came here on Monday for happy hour & dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. Being from a California beach town, I have an affinity for bars that go for that feeling, which Salty Senorita does. I was sort of worried that our food was going to be mediocre, because the place is a little run down, and I was so pleasantly surprised! My taco salad was filled with fresh spring greens, real black beans instead of the refried stuff,  and a yummy spinach tortilla fried crust. My husband's enchilada-style burrito came with a delicious enchilada sauce (just how tex mex red sauce should taste). Coors lights are only $2 till 7, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"For anyone who actually cares what a margarita tastes like, here is your warning. It isn't supposed to taste like ass.  After the travesty of the \"premium\" margaritas, there was no was I was fool enough to try the food.  I'm not usually into the bad review, but if I can dissuade anyone from this travesty posing as a restaurant, I feel I have provided a valuable service."}
{"text":"Got the Estella's fish taco. It was really good.   It was a small street style taco. Fish tasted fresh not frozen. I liked the avocado slice and limes to squeeze on."}
{"text":"Salty Seniorita's should write a book on how to have a bar patio filled to the brim at all hours of the day.  I don't think I've ever driven by or gone to Salty's and seen an empty patio.  I definitely think that's a good thing - there's nothing worse than an empty bar.  I've never had the food here (one of the most common things I have to type on Yelp when I'm yelping a bar/restaurant combo establishment.), but the Margaritas aren't bad.  They often times have really good specials ranging from normal like 1/2 off margaritas to a little on the crazy side - think margarita and manicure for twelve bucks.  Salty's is king of the happy hour and if you work in the old town area, it's a great spot to enjoy the cooler evening temperatures on a happenin' patio.  I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"The taco's are really good... and that's as far as it goes.  I had the lobster burrito the other day and it was awful.  It had the consistency of cottage cheese.  Not much lobster, either.  But, at least they had a ball game on to watch."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a review on the drinks and food but the service my girlfriends & I received prevented us from even getting that far. The bartender was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional. Asked for my ID, and my ID had a little bend in it which he was apparently highly suspicious of and had to go around to all the other bartenders to make sure it was real. When he came back to my group, he basically threw my ID at me then asked what I wanted. When I responded to him with a \"thanks for throwing my ID at me\" I got a very rude \"it's your ID that's f***** up not me, i'm just trying to do my job.\" He seemed annoyed that I would be offended by how rude he was. If you are going to be a bartender, work on your people skills a bit. First time to Scottsdale for Spring Training, and first and definitely last time to Salty Senorita."}
{"text":"Maybe it deserves a half a star more for a big patio and great location in the heart of Old Town. The name, Salty Senorita with it's cheesy psuedo Mexican theme, should be well, a place for a sort of a reasonably priced place for margaritas. Reality is, it's overpriced, not to mention watered down. Is it so wrong to use real lime juice when I paid $11 for it?   I wanted to like this place and looked forward to coming here after a friend raved about how great the margaritas were. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong kind as the menu for margaritas was basically a book, a large selection of Russian roulette.    Since we got here a little late, we ended up ordering dinner here too. It was Friday night of the weekend of the major BCS game, crowd activity was a tad slow, but respectable, most were here to hangout and have a drink. I ordered a burger with waffle fries, but the waitress came back with my plate and apologized for not having any and brought me fries, cold fries. Half-star downgraded. I wasn't even offered to choose something else as a side."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday because i had a Groupon.  I have always wanted to try this place, and the one in Mesa was very close to me, but they closed.  So when a Groupon was offered for the Scottsdale location, I jumped on it, couldn't wait to try it!  The restaurant is in a good location, decent free parking, but that's where it stopped.  We walk in and the music is so loud I considered asking them to turn it down.  Basically what this place is like is a bar that serves below standard mexican food.  We got chips and salsa, which were not free.  And the chips are cold.  Megan got a carne asada burrito and I got tacos.  They were both a small step above Taco Bell.  Service was ok,"}
{"text":"If you and your significant other are getting on each other's nerves or you want to spice things up without spending $$$$ on a therapist or at Fascinations, come to Salty Senorita for the drinks and a little food.  How can you not slap a smile on your face if you're drinking something named the Tijuana Tickler?  Or Sex in an El Camino?  Or Luscious Melons?  OK.  Maybe I have the mind of a 14-year-old boy and the drink names make me giggle, but I've never had a bad experience at Salty Senorita.  Now I always start with the Senorita Chop Salad because that is one tasty combination with chicken, mango, avocado, cucumber, romaine, and whatever other fresh delicious items they add.    I also enjoy the tableside guac and an assortment of tacos, of which the carnitas and shrimp are my favorites.  Go.  Make sure your loved one drinks the El Diablo and you'll have one hell of a weekend.  Oh yeah.  Review #100, mis amigos."}
{"text":"I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!"}
{"text":"Stale chips....and a waitress who SAID she was going to bring them...3 times.  That was the very beginning.  I ordered a pork taco and a shrimp taco.  The menu had a lot of different tacos, burritos, and fajitas on the menu, but only one enchilada choice.  Hmmmm.  We ordered and the waitress said \"Oh, I forgot to tell you, we don't have any of the pork or the seafood menu items today.\" REALLY??????  Still hadn't gotten our stale chips yet.  I perused the menu again and settled on a chicken burrito - wet - with green sauce.  7 minutes later the stale chips arrived, along with an apology from the nice manager about not having the pork and seafood items.  Truck issues.  It happens.  The huge burrito was mediocre, huge chunks of flavor-free chicken, but lots of spicy green sauce inside and out.  As we left, we spied the chip bin, outside in a warming drawer, but the drawer was hanging out of the bin, in the open, flies everywhere.  UGH!"}
{"text":"After at least a dozen trips to Salty's I'm finally writing a review!  If there one thing I must say, I always get good service at Salty's! I've attended a few events here and they make sure they are fully staffed and everyone is attended to.  The food is just mediocre, 3 stars at best, and they have pretty solid chips and salsa.  But that's not why you go to Salty's... you go because they have an awesome patio, stiff drinks and it's a fun place to be."}
{"text":"Just to preface... I am new to AZ, transplanted from the Chicago area, and this is my first review...  Went there on a Friday night with a group of about 8.  I started with the \"house\" margarita on the rocks, and it was pretty weak, but I asked the waiter for something stronger, and he obliged.  The prices were very reasonable, and the service was prompt.    As far as atmosphere, there was not much to it.  Basically a Mexican themed bar, with a mediocre crowd.  There were definitely some lookers on the patio, but also some Scottsdale trash, so I suppose it has diversity going for it.    The music was all over the place, which I am starting to see is a trend in Scottsdale.  If you are going to play rock, stick with rock.  If you are going to play hip hop, stick with it.  I don't want to hear some lame dude's Ipod on shuffle.  Sure there will be a few good songs interspersed, but come up with a cohesive playlist!!  The place is a nice place to grab a drink outside, and enjoy their late night menu (which is the same as their happy hour menu, with a selection of appetizers for $5).  When my group left at around 12:30 AM, the place was 90% empty, so I would say it is a decent place to start off a night, but definitely not a place you need to run to."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!   This was the worst experience ever.  It took 20 minutes just to get margaritas and over an hour to get our food.  The place was practically empty so it wasn't like they were busy.  We could see two people behind the bar.  One was on the computer and the other just standing around.  When the meals came one had avacado on the tacos after having been told that I was deathly allergic to avacado.  The meal was remailed but that also took a lot of time.  The quesadilla was dry and tastless.  The burrito bowl was over salted and 1 of the 3 tacos was pretty good.  We came here at the recommendation of a friend and we were terribly disappointed.  Luckily we were visiting a long time friend so the time wasn't completely wasted.  It is also very expensive for the portion sizes.  Our poor friend was so embarrased.   Definitely avoid this place."}
{"text":"Meh, is right.  Went to Salty Senorita's because we were craving some Mexican food.  Around 6pm on a Sunday night, the place was basically empty.  The menu is limited and a little pricey for bar food.  Yes, bar food.  This place is a bar that serves some standard Mexican fare, but nothing special.  I had the carne asada taco and fish taco which were around $3 each.  Didn't come with beans or rice.  They were OK.  The cheese dip we ordered was runny... excuse me, the Fundido was runny.  The chicken quesadilla was large and actually better than expected.  Service was weak.  The server (don't recall her name, but it's #648 on the receipt) had a squeaky voice and seemed to be in a hurry even though she wasn't busy.  Happy Hour pricing made the beers reasonable, but I won't be looking to come here again with so many other great options in Scottsdale.  Pros=free parking, fun 80s and 90s videos playing on the TVs Cons=service and quality... I see other Salty Senorita's in the Phoenix area have closed.  Sounds like the owner may want to give Gordon Ramsey a call."}
{"text":"All in all this was a fun joint, though the food was only okay. Best enjoyed as a place for drinks and appetizers with friends.    Service was friendly and responsive.  My orders were promptly served and my water glass was always topped off.    Great selection of tequillas, mezcals, and margaritas. The blanco margarita took care of me, yummy!    The appetizers and salsa are great, but the main dishes are only okay. Unless of course you're into piles of industrial-grade cheddar cheese on everything.  I ordered a carnitas burrito because cheddar wasn't listed as a feature, unlike everything else, and it came with gobs both inside and on top. Wet means saucy, not cheesy! Could barely taste the meat.  Very disappointing after a good start."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita is an awesome day time drinking spot with nice outdoor seating and great happy hour specials. I didnt get to try any of there food but from what I saw everything looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Is it really fair to write a review if your memories of a place are misted over with a fine coating of margarita salt?  Sure, why not? I've come here a few times, and every time have been terribly grateful that there are plenty of cab companies in Phoenix.    Cinco de Mayo was absolutely crazy, in a terribly fun way.  Live music, lots and lots and lots of drink specials.  I think we snacked on some appetizers, and from what I remember, we went through them all at a fast pace - so I'm guessing the food was great.  I've also come here with groups for special occasions and general happy hours, and always had a great time.  The patio is perfect for large groups.  The service is fast and friendly, and the prices were great for the number of people and the amounts consumed."}
{"text":"Sandard Salty's food and drinks but disappointingly dead for a Thursday night both before and after a concert and bad service.  The waitress routinely went up to one side of the table and took their orders and then left without asking if anyone else wanted anything.   When our food was delivered we noticed that we didn't have silverware or any of the other stuff that's normally already on the table. Chips and salsa (the main staples of the place) were also hard to come by whenever we ran out.  The sad thing was, this server actually had a trainee following her around.  So if you're lucky, by the time you go there, there'll be at least one more neglectful server there besides the one we had.  Oh, and $1.50 for a teeny little side of sour cream??  Next time I'll bring my own."}
{"text":"Great spot to hit before a Giants spring training game. Great outdoor seating for people watching along Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they make all their money for the year during spring break. It's a fucking zoo.   The outdoor patio is nice during any temperate moment in 85251.    There are 51 styles or flavors of margaritas. Most of them are over-priced.  They serve table side guacamole. It actually wasn't bad. I asked for pomegranate sprinkles to no avail. Barrio Cafe reigns supreme.   I once met a women here. She put my hands on her fakies. She made out with me. We exchanged numbers. She called me the next day. We got drinks. She called me the next day. She asked me for $1100 to send her kid to karate camp. Guess what I did!?"}
{"text":"nice place for a happy hour... i am not a fan of the chips and salsa but the queso is pretty good and some stuff on the menu is good... when i go here i tend to go just to drink... i like the rita's and love the huge deck..."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a mercy 3-star review, but honestly the 2-star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" phrase matches my sentiments too perfectly to round up.  I just didn't much enjoy my visit to Salty Senorita. The food was okay (about 2.5 stars), and the service was alright (another 2.5), but the atmosphere is one of...frat boy party palace (1.5 stars). I don't know; it just seemed like it was all set up for a raging party...only nobody came. And that made me feel bad for them...and lame for being there, like I chose the wrong party to go to that night.  I guess if the food was outstanding I could put up with the \"get ready for a pAAAAArrrtttyyyy!!! ...uh, or not\" ambiance. I'd sit there smugly enjoying my meal like I knew something the rest of the world didn't. Only, the food isn't outstanding. It's really not THAT bad either. It just didn't have...how do I say this? It had no kick. No pizazz! I've mentally blocked most of the experience out, so I just have faint images of bland meats and cheesy sauces. I'm actually trying to block out those memories too. I can't imagine a scenario where I'd willingly return."}
{"text":"I went to Salty's with my husband.  Our dinner was awful.  The cheese dip was okay, and was the highlight of our meal.  Waitress and staff were nice, albeit service was kind of slow.  After a few bites, we couldn't eat anymore.  We asked for the check early and left our plates full.     I don't recommend, unless going for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"I get it, it's busy during Spring Training, but I don't think I've ever experienced such slow service.  The tacos seemed expensive for being advertised as \"street tacos\" and it was definitely not authentic.  The music in the restaurant was so loud you could not hear the people at your own table. The alcohol selection was good though.  Seems like it has the potential to be a great place, so I might be back."}
{"text":"When I had a friend visiting for a mini adult spring break, I knew I had to take her here for some patio sitting and daytime margarita drinking! The laid-back atmosphere is the best part, but the food is decent too. They have a great a la carte taco menu for a makeshift Taco Tuesday...or Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, whenever really!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here but it's a fun place to drink. Lots of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"It's okay.  Nice patio, nice view, good vibe and great people watching.  Notice that I have not commented on the drinks, food or service?  We stop in on occasion and often take out of town visitors there.    Do I like it a while lot?   No not really.    The food, the drinks and the service are okay."}
{"text":"Food ?   I did not know they served food - drinks are good and what a hang out during spring training"}
{"text":"WHY AM I PAYING FOR CHIPS & SALSA!!! Oh that's right, because you have a nice patio, a good location, and cheap happy hour drinks. You win this one Salty's but I will only drink your cheap drinks, I refuse to give you money for your less then mediocre food."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, this place is a lot of fun, however, the last two times I went both my girlfriend and I got sick. We thought it might have been a fluke so we went back again and low and behold...got sick again. Coming out both ends. Yuck! Best of luck to you if you decide to go, just know that you've been warned!"}
{"text":"Chips, salsa, guacamole, beer, tequila, and Blood Mary's. Hey, it's a Mexican bar! And, when you're here...stick to the basics.  I've ventured over to Salty's on several occasions having been turned away by the ridiculously long wait time at RnR. It's generally been a Sunday morning, accompanied by a handful of folks, each with day-drinking and breakfast on the mind. Salty's satisfies the first need, but I've been disappointed by the breakfast. Each time, the potatoes have been cold (I wouldn't mind zapping them for an extra 45 seconds in the microwave), and the rest has been mediocre. My friends have liked their other entrees, but never really impressed.  The good news is you can get great chips and table side guacamole. It's a larger portion than their regular guac with more options for add-ins and flavor. The Bloody Mary bar catches my eye every time. I like to pile in all sorts of spicy veggies and top it off with some organic Bloody Mary mix. Breakfast of champs!  The bottom line: Check out Salty's as a decent alternative to the busier bars nearby. It boasts a pretty great patio and all the drinks, snacks and ambiance to kick off your día de beber!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Happy hour 3 to 7 and reverse 10 to close time. Great margarita and cheese dip sauce and steak salad is really good. Is a really nice cool spot."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Thursday.  Was excited to find out about their margarita/manicure combo (such a fun & clever idea!) but then I didn't end up taking advantage of it.  Had a couple margaritas (can't say they blew my mind) and tried some of their apps (tasty but nothing to write home about).  Best part was probably the salsa.  Mmmm. Love my salsa.  And theirs was good.  Smokey, my favorite.  And the chips were light, crisp and the perfect amount of saltiness.  Would come here again for chips/salsa & probably just stick to beer.    Not bad if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita in Scottsdale... mexican food, football on flat screens, outdoor seating, margaritas!  Kinda sounds like a little piece of heaven to me?  What's not to like, right?  The horrible service.    You might have read the other reviews.  You might be asking yourself if it's really all that bad?  The answer is yes it is.  The little girls they hire to wait tables are across the board worthless.   After watching them I started to question whether or not they literally walk out of their way to avoid seated customers.    It's too bad, because Salty's has all the right stuff... but apparently also has all the wrong people.  If I'm wrong, I'll never know.  After eating there twice and having the same experience, there simply won't be a third time.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Hm. The mexican food is pretty cheap and tasteless (But I'm a tough judge when it comes to this)  The patio is a lively place if you can afford the drink prices. Even during Happy Hour theyre pretty steep.   It seems like a really cool place to stop by after work with some friends on a fall or winter day, but other than that it's not that great. Way too hot in the summer.   Great Margaritas though."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio with tasty margarita's!! Food was ok, music was awesome and it made me want to live in Arizona. :)   Came here on a Sunday afternoon... mixed crowd, from the college types to older adults. Waitstaff was young, we waited a bit at times for our server to check on us."}
{"text":"Oh... no. No. No. No. No.   The meat on my boyfriend's salad was rancid and made him sick. They served bad meat to a customer, what was the cook doing anyway?   Ok, that was really the worst. But then there was also the very loud music, our waitress who was SUPER SWEET and adorable but who disappeared for the entire meal (so we couldn't send the rancid meat salad back to the kitchen or get refills on our water), the seriously oversalted chips, and the fact that the cheese in my enchilada was not melted. In fact, it arrived cold. The salsa was meh, the rest of the food our party received was meh, and well... no. I should qualify this and say that we're from LA and so we have a pretty good idea of the incredible flavors and dishes we can expect when we eat Mexican and this was NOT it. This is... wanna be food. Bar food, and not even particularly good bar food.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"The patio is fun, and the people watching always entertaining.  The food and drinks are mediocre.  Go during happy hour only."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Out here for Spring Training (Go Giants) and decided to come to Salty's bright and early (cough, cough 11:00am) to start our libations adventure! We ordered the Fundido, it wasn't the traditional Fundido you would get at an authentic Mexican restaurant but it was pretty good. The chips and salsa are bomb, could not stop freakin eating them.   The drinks were awesome: We got the Sex in an El Camino, Maria's Choice and that one with the Corona in it (sorry forgot the name)! We were as happy as can be...but wait there is more!!....They had a shuttle to and from the Giants Baseball field!! Wait....,  what?I Yes, you heard me! It gets better... they gave us a 1.00 Margarita coupon if we come back after training! You get a 1.00 Margarita.   Oh and by the way the shuttle driver was a cool dude!   Go Giants!"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is fun. Way fun. Like too much fun - fun.   I had the prickly pear margarita and I was SILLY! It tasted delicious while sitting on the patio and soaking in the wonderful weather.   The mixed-appetizer dish was delicious and fed a lot of us. I'd recommend it for sure.  I would go here often with lots of friends- it's too fun not to!"}
{"text":"Seated at an outdoor table covered w/ water from the mister. Went inside to the deafening music  Happy hour margerita tasted like a 7/11 slurpee. Never served any chips and salsa. Chicken fajitas had little chicken and I had to ask for salsa since my waitress never came back. Tortillas were maybe 5 inches wide and I was only served three of them. Asked for extras and was charged for 3 more. Waitress said she didn't check back with me because she was busy w/ bigger tables. Nice. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place has a really great and laid back atmosphere. It's also a great place to hang out after Spring Training games. Most importantly though, I've been searching for a queso that compares to my favorite queso dip back home and I finally found it at Salty Senorita! Its AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Before you step into Salty's, take it with a grain of the following margarita salt.   I go to Salty's if I want to escape the desert, close my eyes and pretend like I'm at a seaside bar on the beaches of Cabo. With the patio and the ambiance, Salty's has that beachy vibe. It has the vibe that makes you want to drink one too many margaritas and escape reality for a couple of hours. Is it the best restaurant in Old Town? Nope. Do they have the best food? Nope. Then why do I go? I go because while everything is \"just ok,\" the ambiance is fun and they have one heck of a patio.   The food. First, start with the guac. They make it in front of you with fresh ingredients. Second, if you go for the Quesadillas, get them with steak. They taste pretty decent with steak. The tacos are good, but they are street tacos so they aren't very big. If you're really hungry, get between 2-3.   And finally. Sunday brunch! They have a fun Sunday Gospel brunch with tasty breakfast food. They also have excellent happy hour pricing and various specials throughout the week so a dollar definitely goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Their Margaritas will sneak up on you! Most of the food is mediocre- except for the Calamari Taco! NOM NOM NOM is all I have to say! My favorite marg there is the strawberry one with sugar around the rim! Everyone is friendly there as well."}
{"text":"coming home from a hike with the wife and dog, i was craving a margarita with a patio. my experience with their food in the past has been less than stellar. but i was famished and we were able to get in on their brunch menu (but an hour short of happy hour...boo). i ordered a house margarita and it was tasty, salty/sweet, and went down way too easily. and then i had to eat....with trepidation, i ordered a breakfast burrito. it was fantastic. packed with eggs and veggies and i left feeling full, satisfied and happy that i got a great meal and drinks at Salty's!"}
{"text":"OK, so Salty Senorita won't win any \"Best Of\" awards.  I don't think this place is Zagat rated, and I am almost positive they're light years away from winning a Michelin star.  Yet, we keep coming back here, year after year.  This place is so much fun that for a brief moment I actually considered buying a commemorative t-shirt.  Salty Senorita is a can't-miss stop on our annual Arizona tour.  Every time I set foot in this place, I think \"spring break for adults.\"  Laugh if you want, but before you know it, you too will reach that age when you realize you're too old to hang out with the sophomores at Daytona Beach.  Actually, the realization comes only when said sophomores TELL you that you're too old to hang out with them.  Never fear: Salty Senorita to the rescue.  Decorated like a surf bar with a nice patio, Salty Senorita offers cold beer, margaritas and below-average Mexican food at reasonable prices.  The restaurant's motto: \"If the food and drinks are not up to your standards, please lower your standards\" is posted right on the wall to avoid any confusion.  While the food quality will make you long for Chevy's, the people watching will keep you coming back.  The place gets really crowded, especially right after the baseball game lets out.  You will be hard pressed to find a table on the patio, but the inside dining room is cooler and roomier.  The service gets spotty at times, as the restaurant seems to be understaffed during their busy times.    I do love the laid back atmosphere here, though.  Last time we asked the waiter if he could put on the baseball game on TV, and he gave us the remote control instead.  He said something along the lines of \"go crazy and change the channel to whatever you want.\"  How cool is that?  I felt like I was at home, having some chips and salsa and relaxing with a remote in my hands.  I was thinking of changing the channel to Home Shopping Network and waiting to see how long it would take someone to notice that we've been watching \"Tribute to Terrific Turquoise.\"   I know I am coming back next year.  Why not?  I know that the fajita I had here wasn't the worst I've ever had, and the unlimited tortilla chips are great for throwing at your friends if they get out of line."}
{"text":"My first UYE and my first time at the Salty Senorita and what better way to \"pop my cherry\" than with tequila and tacos!  I must admit being a little nervous about going myself to a bar I've never been to party with people I didn't know, but thanks to Lynn W's encouragement, I made it, and I'm glad I did.  I'm rather shy when I'm around new people in a new place, but Lindsey helped with that right away by bringing me to the Cruz Tequila sampling.  A couple small shots *samples* and things were better already!  I found a seat at a table, ordered a margarita, and checked out the group.  I felt a little out of place at first, everyone seemed so young!  I wasn't sitting alone for long, I met Rick and David from EaterAZ, the group sponsoring the Taco Festival next month. They were a riot!  I just might have to attend to the Taco Festival now.   Another margarita, a couple yummy tacos and I was feeling great.    It was great meeting Mark, we were chatting for so long, that all of a sudden we realized everyone else was gone!  All the tables were cleared, and the only thing left from the UYE was the plate and a half of red velvet cupcakes.  Sure was tempting to walk right out with them, they were YUM!, but one cupcake was enough and they were sitting all alone when we left.  I sure hope someone from the bar enjoyed them, they were too good to waste.  All in all it was good to step out my comfort zone, meet some new people and have some drinks.  Thanks Lindsey for putting this together and making me feel welcome.  I'll for sure be around for more events!"}
{"text":"Went in here late last night with a craving for mexican food. The hostess was bubbly and nice, and our server was quiet but I think she may have been new, so no points docked for that.   The chips are so tasty. I'm definitely a fan of the paperthin tortilla chips, served with salsa and pico de gallo, both delicious. My drink never ran empty and we were checked on the perfect amount.  The decor of this place is so cool. It's like a place where a mermaid who's a little rough around the edges would get her drink on. Maybe some sirens too, after a long day of luring in sailors. The bars are adorned in shimmery blue stones and jewels and cool folkartsy paintings hang everywhere.  Our orders arrived, and first thing I noticed: PERFECT PORTIONS! Wooooo! I love going to a place that serves up meals that aren't going to force me to take half of it home to rot in my fridge. I had the chicken enchiladas, and they were delicious. I wish I had more sour cream initially but I just asked for more. I'm usually not even a fan of meat enchiladas but these were fantastic and worth a try.   Another plus: the people-watching. There was a guy talking on the phone by the hostess' podium to who we guessed was a girl.. it was kind of funny because it was pretty heated.   No 'snobs' here, the staff was awesome, food is great!  Four stars until I'm old enough to experience the bar. [;"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Mexican cantina-style places in AZ that gets people so excited. They're basically outdoor stand-around places with free corn chips.  Yea, Salty's has a nice outdoor patio with tables and heaters during the winter time, but I go to Mexican restaurants for the food.  The food here is decent. Servers will make the guacamole for you right at your table and I enjoyed their carne asada burrito. This place is overpriced though. Can't speak for the Mesa location, but I think you pay for atmosphere...or the location.  Parking here is also pretty poor as it's located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. I've been here on a Thursday night and Sunday night and thought it was far more comfortable to spend time there than on weekends.   Salty has a busy happy hour crowd. I don't recommend going for dinner on a weekend night because it's just too packed. Plus, as I mentioned, food is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This is my Sunday brunch place everytime i'm in Scottsdale. Absolutely delish fajitas and and I love their extensive Margarita menu. Their Sunday make-your-own-bloody mary bar is the best :). They have an awesome wait staff as well.... Not complaints. Happy Customer :)"}
{"text":"Still not a fan of this place. It is great for college folks but for me not so much. Oh and before anyone judges, this is not my first time visiting this location but this may have been my last. Just really not a fan unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went here for a going away party with some friends. Overall, meh definitely describes it. The house margaritas were only $4 during happy hour, but they pretty much tasted like a lemon slushie with a splash of tequila. The house margaritas ($7-8) were better though, and I did see people order the giant fishbowl of a drink with a Corona upside down in it.   The nacho appetizer and tacos were decent, but nothing to write home about. The guac was good so long as you don't mind chunks of raw onion in it (I do). Service was inconsistent at best. One waitress was difficult to flag down when we needed her and the other (after the shift change) was attentive and friendly.  Oh, and they added on an 18% gratuity when there were 6 of us in the group. This is one of my personal pet peeves. Besides that, after we split up the bill they tried to tack an extra $10 onto it AGAIN then claimed that was just how the computer did things. They removed it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with four my buddy's & our waitress didn't know our other friend was meeting us there.  He went to the bar to get a drink & bartender told her table 94 needs. The waitress replied in front of my other friend at the bar \"I told them if they need anything to come to the bar. They're some lazy asses!\" My friend replied \"are you talking about the brotheras out there?\" She said \"yes!\" He said \"I'm with them.\" The waitress walked away with her head down.  Judging without knowing. We're never going back to that place!!!"}
{"text":"There was no one to greet us at the door so we ended up seating ourselves.  It took forever for a server to come to our table and when she did, she was friendly.  The food was just okay and the mist was nice but I will not return mainly because this place is not my kind of a eating establishment ~ it has the feel of a run down dive bar ~ everyone eating on the patio appeared to be over drinking.  But give them a try, you might like them."}
{"text":"They're closed!  We used to go almost every Saturday while my son is at skate, but today there were \"available\" signs in the windows, and a landlord lein on the front door."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Salty in Mesa but it closed.  Just tried this location for the first time last week and I still like it!  Went on the Sunday morning after Cinco De Mayo, so I was feeling a little rough.  We had a premium margarita that was on special.  Very strong!  The BF and I shared a breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros.  Both were great, but I liked the burrito better because it had veggies in it.  The servers were all really friendly and helpful.  They have such a fun patio.  I've never been on a Friday or Saturday night, but it looks like it would be a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Terrible management sat us in a section with no waitress 20 mins got appetizer and it was guacamole table side  no lime it was terrible waiter came by asked if we want ed more chips never came back then after being seated at 6pm in an empty section it was 725 and we still did not receive our dinner we got up and complained and wanted to just pay for the chips and guacamole and leave and was approached by a condescending manager  with what he spoke as the truth that his restaurant was busy and it was Friday night and we only waited 15 mins for dinner ,I told him that it was much longer than that and when we sat down it had been 1 hour and 20 mins all I wanted to do was pay and leave so after this ignorant man got done ranting about his truth he said he wasn't charging us for dinner so I proceeded to give our waitress who was wonderful a 20 dollar tip and I said it was not her fault,the manager saw me do this and said to her take the money for the chips out of her tip What a moron ,bad management means a bad reputation and this new ownership should take notice I don't know his name but he was light haired and bug eyed and very rude DO NOT GO THERE"}
{"text":"I just remembered to warn everyone about this dump. Extra star for the large patio which was blessedly quiet both times I went. I routinely see it packed with victims.  The food is as expected at a college bar posing as a restaurant. So we'll skip that part...   Mexican theme + Bar = Margaritas, right?  I'm seriously not sure what they use in their mix, or what's happening to the tequila between the bottle and the pitcher, but something is amiss. We even ante'd up for the premium pitchers and the result was this vile, watery sweet limeade. Barely cold and ice seems to be treated like gold there. No tequila flavor, no hint of fresh juice. Are they using Sysco mixer or something? You could buy Bone Daddy's mixer at safeway and throw in some hornitos and kick the smack out of these. If you have a margaritville mixer, you can even make frozens, if that's your thing.  In any case, skip all around."}
{"text":"Salty's has an awesome patio. I read the reviews and don't understand why most people only rated three or less stars. I have always had a good time on the always filled to capacity uncovered patio.   A group of us rode our bikes here on Easter. We spent the afternoon drinking house margs. and munching on Mexican chow. Salty's patio overlooks Scottsdale Road and is great for people watching.  I'll be back!  UPDATE: I just learned that Salty's patio is dog friendly until it gets crowded at night."}
{"text":"Ahh yes, old salty balls.  I don't advise coming to Arizona for anything other than Spring Training (maybe golf?).  If you happen to find yourself in Scottsdale in March, make sure to stop off at  ye olde Salty Senorita for a basket of chips and margaritas. I essentially lived here for two days with a group of buddies. Its the perfect place for getting a little rowdy.   Nothing about the food stood out much. It wasn't bad, but also not memorable.   Wait staff is very friendly and accommodating.   Short walk to Scottsdale spring training stadium!"}
{"text":"When friends come to town and they want to hit up Old Town, one of the places on our list to start the night is the Salty Senorita.  It's convenient location lends itself to the perfect starting point for a night out in Old Town.  Their Street Tacos are very good and they have a good variety of Mexican food on the menu.  From time to time I will find a deal on Groupon.  When that happens, I jump all over it and buy as many as I can purchase....then it gives me an excuse to go out, ha!  There's a nice patio for the awesome weather months.  During the Parada del Sol, this is a great spot to watch the parade and have a few drinks.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed here, people. Server forgot to input my order and the place wasn't even busy. I ended up getting the wrong order after a lengthy 40-minute wait. So the manager gives me a $2 coupon for my next visit. It's still sitting in my car.   Not too generous on the pours... and the Malibu Pineapple was too watery. Definitely a downer in my book :("}
{"text":"I don't mind this place, definitely better service than their sister in Mesa. Too bad parking sucks around here. But if you get inside, the place is usually popping during happy hour. During spring training, it's a zoo. Food is average but I've always had good friendly service up at the bar. Viva Malibu Rum!"}
{"text":"Clever name, perfect for snagging unsuspecting tourists. Nice patio, ideal for passing the time waiting for a server to acknowledge your existence or for anything from the slow kitchen. Ideal Old Town location, one block from the hospital. A fitting neighbor for the home of the worst tacos in town. The $2 (stale) chips and (strangely oily) salsa are a perfect complement to anything on the overpriced menu."}
{"text":"Great, cheap place to drink, DJ Hazardous is awesome! 2 dollar beers, cheap eats, and a great dj is what keeps me coming back to saltys in mesa. Staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out a mexican place outside of CA but this place was nothing spectacular and it was overpriced.  Went there on a Thursday afternoon to check out their Happy Hour and watch the game.    Their HH menu was pretty weak - i ordered the taquitos off the HH menu.  It still came out to $4 for 3 really greasy fried taquitos with barely any meat inside.   Not impressed.  I opted for the 6 tacos of your choice off the dinner menu to share with a friend.  The 6 taco platter was priced at $17.  And they ran out of corn tortillas. I wasn't impressed with any of the tacos - i think I could of had better at a California franchise like rubios.   Well drinks were 1/2 off so i did get a vodka gingerale (homemade gingerale) for about $3 - so that was probably the only thing i really liked that night.   My friend got a margarita - that there was no HH special on it  - i figure there should be at least a few bucks off every type of drink during HH but guess not  This HH/dinner meal came out to be $40 - not worth it - food wasn't great and no buzz off the drinks."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. They must have been understaffed as the service really was poor. The chips seemed very stale and we had to ask several times for small portions of salsa. Food was only OK. Seems like we waited for hours for plates to be picked up and bill delivered. The manager finally stepped in to assist. I have never one to comment like this but I would never go back."}
{"text":"went here a bunch lately, and again this is one of those I wish it could get 2 and a half stars deal.  For some reason in this place the waitresses tend to slack. I have no idea what they are doing but they arent serving, and they are not the friendliest.  Had a serious cold fish here this weekend.  Have no idea why.  Maybe just a bad night.  Drinks are cool, and the patio is pretty fun.  I always advise making this pit stop but it is definitely hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great patio. Great. For day drinking, night drinking, eating, you name it.  I love their salsa. Its the perfect consistency of sweet and hot. And it stays on the chip! Always an important quality in good salsa.  If you like margaritas, go here.  They have a TON to choose from. My personal fave is the Luscious Mellon marg. Ohhhhh yeah."}
{"text":"Typical mexican-themed college-type bar, with drink specials every day and so-so food.    I did actually go there once and had a good raspberry margarita during happy hour.  But then went back there for a friends bday party which happened to be on Cinco de Mayo weekend, that was a mistake.  $10 to get in and $8 crappy margaritas."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. This has nothing to do with the fact my co-worker and I went on a Wednesday night but we were on a business trip and wanted to drink. Isn't this a Mexican restaurant? They had the most terrible tequila selection (or lack thereof) that I have ever seen and the bartender kept telling us they were out of everything. We had already eaten dinner but wanted chips and salsa to munch on..cold chips and sewage-like looking salsa is $1.99...fine, but can you at least heat them up?? This place was gross and I will not be back here again. Oh, the one thing that was good was our bartender. She only works wednesdays but was awesome!"}
{"text":"Good outdoor patio for day-drinking. Decent prices, friendly service. I've never eaten here. Tables fill up / dirty up fast outside, obviously, seating is at a premium. A good spot for sunny springtime booze!"}
{"text":"If you go in with realistic expectations, you will be okay.... First of all, just cuz a restaurant always looks busy, has lights, bells and whistles and lots of drunken and colorfully clad hip looking people does not mean GREATNESS in the food and service departments. Salty has a super dooper happy hour. I can drink here for three hours and have an appetizer and I am out for less than $20. I may have to wait for service. I may not hear my friends because teh music is too loud. I may be smoked out if I sit outside becase EVERYONE smokes out there and it drifts around quite well. The inside is dark and loud , too. I have actually had my best experiences at the inside bar, if you want service and atmosphere, The wings are great, many flavors for you novices. They serve them with jicama instead of celery, which is cool. My non-NY friends love the ranch-cilantro wings, eh. The fish tacos are okay, esp at happy hour when you're not paying much. The food is average. Come for happy hour, deal with the small issues and enjoy. And watch tourists walk by wondering why people are having so much fun out on the deck. OH AND RIDE HOME IF YOU'RE TANKED IN THE SALTY BUS OR CART!! That's a plus!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great outdoor patio. I didn't try the food, just drinks. They were alright. The service was fair. The best part of the night was a giant game of Jenga (like 2 feet high off the table, it got taller than me in the end!). It wasn't very busy, but maybe because it was a Tuesday night in August. Fun times!"}
{"text":"I don't see the big deal about this place.  The food is nothing spectacular, they don't really have any good drink specials.  Oh, and the service is horrible.  I went there twice and had bad service both times.  The wait times for a server to take a drink order are ridiculous and they don't like to come back and check on you.  The servers would rather hang out and talk to each other than take care of their customers.  I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Having been to Salty on several occasions for lunch and happy hour it definitely deserves more than the 3 it's been averaging.   It's one of the top lunch spots my coworkers and I head to in Scottsdale. The lunch menu is fantastic. There are at least a few things on the menu I'm still dying to try and I've had a few varying items already. The fish tacos are insanely good and the lunch menu is reasonably priced. The margaritas are some of the best in the area. I typically go with the salty senorita.   The non-tomato based salsa? The shit.  The decor and feel of the establishment is soothing and relaxing in an odd way and I love it. Additionally the insanely wide variety of music they play has my coworkers and I either singing along, embarrassed about \"that one person we can't remember\", or reminiscing about something it reminds us of constantly.  My real beef with this place is that the happy hour service is a little lacking and heading there after work only to find they switch to valet sucked."}
{"text":"It's Salty's... it's a bar you go to after a spring training game after you're already drunk.  I've eaten there several times, drank there several times.  It serves it's purpose and it's fun after a ballgame. Whenever I have been there just to 'go', it's at the request of others, not me. The food is mediocre (do not get the fish tacos, they are nasty).  But if you want a margarita (somewhat overpriced), some chips and salsa, and good people watching.. this is the spot."}
{"text":"In all fairness to the SS people, I was on the fence between a 2 and a 3 star rating. Went with the 2 because it doesn't sound like we are the only people with a bad experience.  After a super fun experience getting our NOH8 photos taken at the theatre down the street we were hungry. The Salty Senorita was close so we walked over. Got seated right away. The Hostess came back and gave us water and took our drink order and we ordered tableside Guacamole at the same time.  The tableside Guac came and it was the Hostess preparing it. I'm not sure if she only did the tableside prep or also pulled the ingredients in the kitchen, but the Guacamole was the worst I'd ever had - the amount of salt in it was enough to have killed a sidewalk of snails. The waitress came to the table and we told her and she offered to go make a fresh one. That came out and it was perfect.  I can't remember exactly when we ordered our lunch tacos, but we got there about 1:15, at 2:10'ish the manager came to apologize and said that he was going to take care of us.   Finally our tacos came out. Mine were room temperature, I swear a couple of pieces of steak were almost cold, even (but that may have been me hungry and pissed off). They were sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered for so long that the tortilla shells were sticking to the metal serving tray-we had to use a fork to pry them off.  Honestly, I really think that they would have been good had they been warm.  The waitress came back quite a few times to check on us and apologize. She was great about filling our sodas for us. The manager took care of our bill, all of it (which is why I was on the fence about putting down a 3 for my rating). The waitress also gave us two free appetizers, \"in case you will come back\". She didn't really phrase it the best way, but I can't blame here.  Seating - we didn't go inside, so I don't know anything about the interior. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day. The umbrellas in the tables were not secured. There were a few wind gusts that caused us to grab at our umbrellas. In looking around, everyone felt the need to grab at their umbrellas. There was one table that the umbrella completely blew up and out - quick reaction from the diners kept it from hitting any of the neighboring diners. This seems like another quirk they probably should work out.  Will we go back? I'm sure we will. The food really seemed like it was going to be good - the ingredients all looked like they were there."}
{"text":"It's a good place to start a pub crawl. We usualy start and work our way into Old Town from there. The tablemade guacamole is where it's at though! I get it everytime and have never been disappointed. The margarita samplers are a great way for a group to get the night started. We usually get 2 or 3 samplers for 4 people and pass them around so everyone can find their favorite margarita (tip, keep your straw!)."}
{"text":"The food wasn't awful, but the price is far too high for what you get. Individual tacos start at $3 ... Seriously?  Our waiter, while nice and pretty up on refilling drinks, was otherwise terrible. He took the order wrong, blamed it on us for not being clear enough, leaving two out of three of us waiting another half hour for our desired meals. Then when the bill finally came, which was a really long time coming, the mistaken items still appeared on the tab. After talking with the manager those excess charges were removed.  But then again with the TVs turned up so loud you have to shout at each other to have simple conversation, it's no shock that the waiter got the orders mixed up.  Dinner here was a real comedy of errors. When a waitress brought us a basket of sliders and dropped them, pulled pork and tinga chicken splattering across the table, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity."}
{"text":"After the terrible service that we experienced at the Mesa location a couple nights before, but wanting to try the desserts, we stopped by the Scottsdale Salty Senorita to see just how good the Sailor Jerry's brownie was.  Came in mid-day to find no hostess and no sign saying to seat ourselves and we ended up standing there for a little over 10 minutes while a bartender 5 yards away stared at us on occasion while talking to a couple people sitting at the counter. Right when a group of people blew passed us and sat down, he asks if we need any help. We mention wanting a table and he answers, \"Yeah, Lexis will help you out with that,\" before returning to his conversation.   Great...   Taking a cue from that other group, we just headed for a booth. Our waitress came out, and we ordered the brownie as well as their margarita cheesecake for contrast.   The brownie vaguely had the taste of rum, while the \"margarita\" cheesecake just tasted like cheesecake, though it tasted better after squeezing a couple lime wedges on top. Between the two, the brownie was better. It was warmed and served with vanilla ice cream.    Took a long time for the check to come, just like in the Mesa location.   I just don't know about this chain. From what I understand, the service is better at this one, but the food is just not worth the prices. I mean, the place has margaritas that run $200 apiece like they're the Five Dollar Shake of Tarantino lore."}
{"text":"My first experience with Salty Senorita's in Scottsdale occurred yesterday with Lindsey's Taco Tuesday event. It was great to see Lindsey again and one or two familiar faces. Most everyone else was new for me and I enjoyed getting to know them. Good conversation about the upcoming Taco Festival and next year's Scottsdale Culinary Festival. Great meeting Patrick & Robin. And I also enjoyed meeting the very tall and very attractive woman selling wooden beads.  Using information I gathered while speaking to Patrick, I was able to impress her with my knowledge of the Culinary Festival after he left. Thanks, buddy.  I sampled two kinds of tacos and they were amazing - and who could miss the Fundido? I will definitely come back and try Salty's tacos in the future. A large game of Jenga was occurring behind me; however, due to past run ins with the Parker Brothers folks, I am still boycotting Jenga.  The red velvet cupcakes were amazing and at the end of the night I was trying to determine if I could sneak an entire plate of them out the door before being noticed. Since I skipped running and spin class to come to the event I shouldn't compound the problem by woofing down 20 cupcakes. At least that's what I told myself.   A great night of friends, fun, and tacos - with a couple of shots of Cruz Tequilla. Perfect."}
{"text":"Great drinking spot-their happy hour is top notch and seems to last forever. Cute waitresses -all dressed to impress ha!   Food is decent, but you can tell its more of a drinking joint. But good happy hour menu and tasty finger foods. Plus, sitting outside and drinking 2 dollar beers is wonderful."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita's isn't the place to go if you crave authentic Mexican food.  As a matter fact the food is ordinary at best. The in-house salsa is pretty good though as is their cheese dip.  However if you're looking for generic Americanize Mexican food it's not too bad I guess.  Where Salty's excels is the outdoor and open air seating in a cool part of town. Even on hot days misters keeps things cool.  Coupled with a good house Margarita, cold beer and good music it's easy to get swept up in an afternoon or evening of relaxed drinking with a few friends. There always seems to be some sort of discounted drink or food special.  Baseballs spring training brings even more specials.  Service is typically good and if sitting at the bar better than average.  At first glance Salty Senorita's is the type of place I avoid. Yet I usually find myself enjoy stopping in. My advice is to have dinner somewhere else, then stop in for a few drinks."}
{"text":"This was our destination after every spring training game at Scottsdale stadium. Tip a golf cart and you'll be there in a flash. We never ate there but they did bring tasty chips and salsa. I think we ordered guac too and it was good.   I don't understand the low ratings but te beer is cheap. There's a ton of waitresses and they do a decent job of paying attention to their areas. They are all attractive too.   I remember the beer prices being reasonable and the patio is the place to be. I would say this is spot is as popular as momos is to giants home games. Minus the fine dining."}
{"text":"I've been to this Salty Senorita three times to eat, and a few more with just the sole intention of getting drunk. After my most recent experience here, I can guarantee that I will not be eating here ever again, and it's highly unlikely that I'd be back to drink, either. Went in this past Sunday at about 3 in the afternoon with some friends, there were a total of maybe 20 people in the place, most of them posted up at the bar. Not busy whatsoever, which means there's no valid explanation as to why the service was so utterly slow. The salsa was bland (tried both the regular and the \"hot\"...which wasn't in any way), the food was overpriced for what you get, and what I got was the wrong order so I had to send it back (which I absolutely hate doing...I've seen \"Waiting\" a few times). Our waitress was as bland as the salsa, and the whole staff just seemed bored and annoyed that they were there. One of my friends who was starving didn't even finish half of his food, it was so awful, and when I finally got my order back the second time it was still not what I had asked for. At this point we just wanted to leave, so I gagged it down and we payed our bill, happy that this experience was finally over."}
{"text":"What kind of nasty sauce do they have on their enchiladas?  Service was alright...but their food was horrible.  (I felt bad because I made my friend chose the restaurant...she loves their seafood tacos....maybe I should have gotten those again)  When we got there at 8pm on a Friday night, the place was dead.  After an hour, obnoxious turds were in my zone....you don't go near my zone, especially if you are a turd.  (Hence drunk nasty guy who knew that my friend had a burn on her arm because he makes pizzas and he knows burns.  Who cares and get away!  You make pizzas)    Change the sauce, and I may give you a second shot. (and yes I did take it back)  All I know is that after I drank my maragarita, I had a splitting headache for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"We stopped here because of the decor and we were craving Mexican. It looks like Joes Crab Shack on the California coast, but smack dab in Arizona!   The outdoor seating under umbrellas was nice, but with the changing sun meant we had to keep rotating seats, and the metal stools got HOT!   Our waitress was very nice, and since we were there for lunch, before happy hour started, we ordered off the lunch specials menu, which were not a bad deal at all.  Happy hour is 3-7 PM daily.   First, we PAID for chips & salsa (although once you pay they are bottomless), and that was good. I got the steak salad, which would have been good but it was 50% made up of cucumbers! I picked all of those out and there wasnt much lettuce around the steak left. My husband got the 2 taco plate, with rice & beans. It was clear that rice & beans had been plated long before the tacos were, so that was cold when we got it. Had to send it back for new rice & beans. The tacos werent bad, but my husband liked the fish one best.  The biggest disappointment was that the margaritas were EXPENSIVE, and when I got the deluxe one it tasted gross. not even sure how to describe the base, as it wasnt lemon-ish or lime-sh, or sweet. Not sure what to call it, but it WASNT good. Stick to beer here."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and thought this place was nice. We were in a really large group, so I am trying not to be too picky about service. It was kind of slow, but they were really nice.  The food was pretty good. Not really much different than what I could get back home, but I am always game for queso, and the queso here was brought out in a little cast iron bowl, and it was spicy. The chips were really warm, which, YUM. I got a chicken taco and thought it was good. Not great, but good.   Had I been able to hang around town a little more, I definitely would have found other places to eat."}
{"text":"Usually we like Salty's but when we went there for a fun Saturday Cinco De Mayo party. Our day went from fun to totally grossed out!!!! They had these plastic yard glasses that they were selling for $5,so if you pay the extra $$$ and you get to keep the glass.  Well apparently they didn't order enough, and they were telling the bus boys they need to try and collect them if they could. Now I'm all about helping some one out in need. That is if they ask me nicely....BUT.......there was this little punk a$$ bus boy that wasn't even asking if we would give them up, he was trying to just take them off our table.  Rule #1 DON'T TOUCH MY BEER.  Rule #2 ASK ME NICELY IF YOU CAN TAKE MY STUFF FROM MY TABLE. Rule #3 DON'T MAKE RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT MY FRIENDS AND I WHEN WE SAY NO THANK YOU. See it's really not our problem you guys ran out. Call you beer vendor and ask him to bring you more. That's what you pay him for.  So after a while some of us decided to mingle and see what they had going on in the blocked off parking, with the band and stuff. And who should we see rifling thru THE GARBAGE but that same bus boy looking for those green PLASTIC yard glasses!!!!  I almost threw up my overpriced cheese quesadilia!! We could not believe it. We told the management what we saw, and hopefully it wasn't the same management that told him to do it. And they seemed less then interested. Instead of telling management I should have called the Board of Health. YUCK!!!! Think of it this way people, if they're pulling those plastic cups out of the trash to make more $$$$ what else are they pulling out of the trash to resale to make more $$$$. That is just Wrong and Nasty!!! Salty's you should really be ashamed of yourselves."}
{"text":"They are famous for margaritas but let me tell you: their margaritas are EXTREMELY SALTY! EXTREMELY!"}
{"text":"If they had a zero I would give it. Now to be fair we came here at 930 on a Sunday night but that only excuses the service being subpar. They were clearly ready to go home. They even tried taking our settings after we ordered food before the food came out.   Ok I can live with bad service but them we order the food and first the menus sucked but then we get our food (tacos, pretty much the only thing this place had) and they were not only not close to being authentic bit they tasted like crap.   Needless to say won't be going here again. You'd think they would read the reviews and change how they do business. We unfortunately didn't see the reviews until after the food was ordered. (They didn't show up in our restaurant search because they moved recently."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.   Great food, pretty good service. The dollar tacos were \"ok\" but the taquitos were EXCELLENT!!!"}
{"text":"good food, reasonable prices, and an incredible staff.  this place was a great place to stop during my first visit to arizona. the mexican food is better than at home, as it is all over the southwest, and the salsa is very spicy and interesting.   again, there seems to be a chicken crisis in arizona as the quality of the chicken meat was not as good as i had hope for. other than that i have nothing but good things to say about my experience here."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and food, but it just seems dirty to me. Not a place I would take my parents or anyone I cared about making a good impression on. Great sunny patio tho and the chips are crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of eating here. It is terrible! Food is dreadful. Better Mexican can be found in the frozen section of your local Safeway. This place should be avoided. The drink menu looks impressive, too bad the drinks are not. If you like straight tequila, go ahead, any other reason this is the place to avoid."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Margaritas were ok but not over-the-top-write-home-to- Mom-about and service was standard.  It was a nice day so we decided to sit outside.  The patio could use a little over-haul in the area of furniture/decor but other wise was functional.  Complimentary chips and salsa were really good and they offered PB&J for kids so that was pretty awesome.  Food was pretty standard bar/TexMex food.  I will be back just not going to rush right over there or anything.  I live right down the street and this is the second time in almost 3 years I've been there."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita has always been a stop before games during Spring Training each year. The previous location had a amazing service and a rustic ambiance that was not pretentious, but comfortable.  The margaritas were also fantastic and the waitresses so helpful.   Since returning this year I was able to try out their new location. I was excited to see the upgrades but sad to see the Old Salty's personality disappear.  The new Salty's, while very nice, goes right into the stereotypical Scottsdale experience that you can see across the street at RnR.  We went late on night celebrating a friends belated birthday and sat in a long booth in near the bar. The restaurant was not packed, but service was very slowly.  The margaritas we loved were not the same as before and not sure I would order them again on upcoming trips. The waitress was condescending and rude, but again we blew it off.  Drinks were slow to come, the waitress was unsure of suggesting drinks or menu items. She made us so uncomfortable we walked to a nearby bar to have drinks the remainder of the evening.   Happy to see Scottsdale growing and getting better, but am sad to see the Old Salty's go and make way for a less superior product.  Not sure we'll come back again."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped in this afternoon (Saturday) and the place was pretty slow. It was my first trip to this location, though Ive been to the Scottsdale location on several occasions.  The first thing I noticed is that this location is beautiful. From the two large bars to the outside patio I felt immediately comfortable and had flash backs of spending Spring Break in Cabo.  Our server was gorgeous, just incredible. I cant recall her name but she reminded me of a younger, more attractive Thandie Newton. So within just a couple of minutes I was ready to give our visit 5 stars.   Unfortunately things went south fast. After our server took the drink order she just disappeared for about 10 minutes. Since we had just come from playing miniature golf (in the middle of summer) the kids were very thirsty and this long departure made it very difficult for them... and us.  She finally returned and took our order. That went pretty smooth. We didnt order anything unusual or \"off the menu.\" My wife decided to have a Strawberry Margarita.  Again the server disappeared, this time for over 20 minutes. So by this point we've been in the restaurant over half an hour and we still dont have our food and my wife never received her margarita... on a very slow Saturday afternoon.  I caught the attention of a manager and asked him to refill our drinks and check on our food. He returned a couple moments later with our server in tow and food in hand. It looked good, but the plates were scorching hot and the food was lukewarm, which is usually a sign the food has been sitting in the expo window for a long time.  The food tasted good, including my wife's chicken quesadilla... unfortunately she ordered a steak quesadilla. By this point we were just happy to have food so we didnt complain.  The manager seemed very apologetic and offered us a free appetizer for our next trip, which isnt likely to ever happen at this location. I would have preferred a discount on the bill or maybe an offer of dessert but no luck."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita has great margaritas and great drink specials. I ordered a fish bowl and it consisted of a huge margarita with a Coronita upsidedown in it. It wasn't super strong but I got a good buzz out of it. It was some kind of special, I think it was called Margarita Monday so it was gigantic and only $6!! The food was mediocre and was overpriced in my eyes. The only thing that stood out considering the food was the fact the the waitress made the guacamole from scratch at the table! Talk about fresh! It was so good and the table demolished it. I would return for drinks, especially if I were craving a margarita but probably not for food."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind after a bad day at work.  Actually, this is a great place to unwind even if you had a wonderful day at work.  Chips, salsa and strong margaritas always put me in a good mood.  Plus, the place is a meat market of sorts, with all of Scottsdale's finest (or worst?) turning out in all their spikey-haired or saline-filled glory.    But don't worry- it's not exactly a dress-to-kill spot, although you'll still find some people that dress up to go sit and have a beer.  You can wear whatever you want- meaning shorts and flip flops are perfectly fine here.  On Sunday's, they have a make your own omelet bar that is pretty awesome too.  You get fruit and potatoes with it, and if you add a spicy bloody mary to your order, you'll have a perfect Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour!  THey also have all you can eat tacos for $5 every Friday.  Ask for Rich as a bartender.  He's the man."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how bad the customer service was yesterday!! We came here to watch the Giants game because they have Giants flags outside but FYI they don't have the MLB package or even the MLB channel. Anyway, my friend ordered 5 house tequila shots.. 10 min later the waitress comes back to clarify the shot because the $1 \"house shot\" was a premade mix, not tequila. We said fine we'll take the house shot. 10-15 min later we were still waiting on our drinks so my friend called the waitress over after she was done helping the table next to us. We asked where our drinks were and this was the conversation:  Waitress- \"Oh we had to clarify the shot so she's making them right now.\"  My friend- \"I thought you clarified the shot 15 min ago when you first cake back? Are you clarifying the clarification now?\" Waitress- \"yea\" My friend- \"uh, okay. Can you please bring those over because we've been waiting 30 minutes and I don't think it takes that long to pour a shot\" (Manager comes over) My friend starts explaining the situation and the manager starts laughing.. My friend- \"are you laughing at me?\" Manager- \"actually yes I think this is pretty hilarious. You're obviously drunk so ill just get your check and you can go\" (He was not at all drunk and we still haven't gotten our drinks at this point\" General manager comes over, my boyfriend says \"I'm sorry about this misunderstanding\" and he says \"it doesn't bother me, you guys are just a bunch of assholes anyway\"  Seriously, were we in the wrong?? I don't think so.. And I really can't believe they were so rude to us"}
{"text":"It was my buddy's bachelor party, and we came here for dinner. It was Saturday night, and we were afraid that our large party of 12 would have to wait awhile. However, when we arrived, we were greeted cheerfully by the hostess and didn't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes. We went to the bar and grabbed some margaritas. They weren't great, but they weren't bad, either.  As far as the decor goes, it reminded me of the Saddle Ranch, but with a little less \"cowboy.\" They had a nice outdoor patio area where smokers could sit at tables and they even had an outdoor bar there.  We were finally seated and and the server came by to get our drink orders. She was not the most competent server, and the service as mediocre, but not bad. She would forget drinks, forget to bring things that were requested, and didn't come around enough.   As for the food, it was your standard mexican fare with some unique standouts like the ancho pork tamales or pablano and cheese tamales. I had the carne asada burrito, which was good, but not anywhere deserving of the term \"delicious.\" And at $12.50, not great value for the money.  It was nice to have TVs in there to watch March Madness, but the screens were so small that if you weren't seated near one, you had to get up from the table and walk over to a set in order to be able to see the score.  If you are in to people watching, there is a wide range of demographics that patronize this place. It was neat to see different styles of people from old to young, rocker to preppy all converge on this place and have a good time.  Overall a cool place to get some mexican food. Great name, too!"}
{"text":"Pretty fun place to go before spring training games. The crowd is really really fun and on the younger side. The food was okay, nothing special. I would definitely go back on a warm day where you're looking to day drink outside (the patio is really fun). They have some random board games that you can use as drinking games (like jenga). Best part was the cheap beers and margaritas for spring training and the free shuttle to the game."}
{"text":"I can't say that I am a big fan of Salty's. I have been there a few times for happy hour and I just haven't been impressed. I don't like the margaritas. They are SOOOO sweet! The last time I was there I asked if they had Sangria, the waitress asked me if that was something that you eat or drink? Sigh. I do like the chips and guacamole! :) But sadly that is about it."}
{"text":"I give it 2 stars for food, but a nice place to chill out for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Met for what was to be my birthday lunch. No specials no bday offers. Had a spinach cheese Quesadilla which was ok. Tasty but nothing extra special . The margarita was ok, suppose to be a specialty, ehh.. a few less ice cubes and a bit more liquid would of been nice.   Our server was pleasant, did wih a happy birthday  and did write it on the receipt also...that was nice.. btu something extra would of been nicer."}
{"text":"Dangerously within walking distance from my place.  I do love a good margarita and Salty's margarita's are awesome!  $4 happy hour margaritas is a steal!  The Tinga nachos are delicious and are a must try!  I love the atmosphere at Salty's.  Its a place after a Spring Training game or to do some day drink with friends.  I'm not a guacamole fan but this is one of the only places I've seen that offers tableside guacamole."}
{"text":"Been there earlier this month while on a tour around the US. I had got the best burritos ever! Nice staff, a chance to win a bicycle, and great music. Couldn't be any happier with Salty Señorita! :)"}
{"text":"Here's your serviceable, affordable, festive and fun \"beach shack\" in Scottsdale. And there's parking.  Go for the guac and the salsas and the fish tacos.  Avoid the carne asada and carnitas.  Check in on foursquare for the first time and get a $1 Pacifico.  Ask for extra chips."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I ordered their chicken fajitas and while it was filling and quite a bit of food, the entire dish was over seasoned and although it's their name, it was EXTREMELY salty. Overall, it was good!"}
{"text":"This is a place to do happy hour and maaaybe a few apps.  It's a fun environment for just that.  However, do not come here hungry as we 5 ladies did b/c you will be very disappointed in the mediocre food.    Quite possibly the worst tacos ever and guacamole wasn't all that even though it was made tableside.  The best thing about my meal were my taquitos (apps) and they were half off.  The margarita wasn't too bad, but I wasn't in a drinking kinda mood. (shock!).  We should have listened to our driver when he told us exactly what I said in my first paragraph.  Damn stubborn girls looking to be seen in a \"happening\" place.  We had fun, but our tummies hated us...lol."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating here. Tacos were not fresh and not presented well. Walk a block or two and eat better someplace else. #igotabadtasteiymouth"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for happy hour and they had great drink and food deals. The salsa, wings, and nachos were really good. I like the outside because they have the misters which make the AZ heat manageable.   However our waitress wasn't very attentive to our needs even tho it was slow. She actually gave us another table's ticket and walked off. We asked to split our check in half,  one of us had a card the other had cash; we wanted to leave her a tip in cash but she ended up deducting the cash and charging the rest to the card. Oh well! Still a cool place just have to work on the service portion."}
{"text":"After a day full of meetings, I gathered a friend, and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. \"Hi, are you here for happy hour?\". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe \"lots of product in his hair\" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation \"on the rocks with salt\". My drink, and my friend's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. My friend brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now my friend is getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Friend mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and my friend asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. My friend had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok.  This is a never return place for me. And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant. The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This review is WAYY overdue considering it's almost time for us to come back! We come to Scottsdale for Giants Spring Training. I found Salty Señorita on Yelp for the Happy Hour. So this rating is really for the Happy Hour (3-7PM). They do a few appetizers for $5 and under and then Margaritas for $4, $3 Well/Wine/Corona, $2 Coors, $1 Shots. Not Bad. The place was pretty busy when we came around 4PM after a day came during Spring Training. The waitress we had wasn't the best but what do you expect. The Margaritas are decent as was the appetizers. We got the nachos and another appetizer to share as well as a few Margs each. We just came here after the game for a bite. We had plans for dinner late in the evening. The Happy Hour ended up benign a good deal and it was definitely a great place to people watch. In addition to the inside area they also have an outdoor patio in the front. We would have sat in the front however it was WIDLY crowded. The patio was definitely the place to be. Overall, Salty Señorita is a good place for Happy Hour but I probably wouldn't come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Cute waitresses in short shorts! Too bad they're not so good at their jobs and dumb as rocks. I had literally 5 different girls serve us at different points in the day and they all messed up something.   The hostess took us a table, then a different waitress gave us menus and walked away, then she came back 1 minute later with waters and put them ON TOP of the menus that we were reading, forcing me to immediately, put down the menu, move my water glass, and pick up the menu again.   10 minutes later a different waitress asked us if we'd been helped (we hadn't) so she left and yet another waitress showed up to take our orders. We also ordered cocktails and sodas which were served by two different people at two different times. PS - the diablo margarita tasted exactly like robitussin cough syrup. So gross!   We ordered the steak salad and a chicken salad. The steak was over-cooked and too chewy to eat. The chicken salad was decent except that it was purported to have fresh mango in it and i counted exactly 1 piece of mango in my salad. Awesome. While we were still eating the waitress brought our bill (I guess we weren't ordering dessert) and so we took our queue and got the hell out."}
{"text":"The service was non existant. I can't say lousy because we never got any service. 23 minutes and not one employee talked to us. So I decide to go to the Bar to buy a couple of shots of $12 tequila, have to pry the Bartender away from the TV set. Ask for two tequilas on their menu and he comes back and says they are out. I say that's it. So we ran across the street to RnR's and the service was the best. The food was awesome.  Will never ever go to Salty Senorita's again."}
{"text":"The only thing salty was the abrasive bartender and the lip of my Libby tumbler. Look, I'm sorry you didn't get cast in the Blossom reunion. Get over it. I guess they're famous for the blended margaritas which were at a decent happy hour price. But seriously. It was like frozen limeade with a shot of rubbing alcohol. Ewww. Not so great. And the taquitos? What? Squeeze me? Two taquitos, cut in half, made to look like four. Who's your chef? Vern Troyer? They were the size of my middle toe. I kid you not. I won't go on about the Scottsdale crowd that frequents the Salty. Really I won't. Block head dudes with Ed Hardy T shirts and Michael Kors tans. And the babes. The chicks. Boobies SO big, after a few of those rank ritas, I had this image of all of them exploding at the same time, with chards of silicon splattering everywhere. Knocking over the oh so clever \"I used to be a Corona beer but now I'm a salt and pepper shaker\" bottles. See. I told you I wouldn't go on and on!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for a drink, it was busy, not that busy with enough staff. We didn't get chips, salsa or anything. I'm annoyed."}
{"text":"Great first experience for me, had a Groupon. I had 2 tacos off the happy hour menu, pretty tasty with lots of filling. The drinks were really good and strong enough to get a buzz. Devon was our waitress and was genuinely friendly and very attentive. Will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in on Sunday before a spring training game for some beers and lunch.  They seemed understaffed for the size of the crowd, which was surprising considering they are a pretty popular pre-game spot.   My wife and I ordered food, just a burrito and some tacos, pretty simple.  After about 15 minutes we asked the waitress about our order and she told us the kitchen was super backed up and it could be a while.  She was nice about it, and she kept the beer coming, so no big deal.  20 minutes later, still no sign of our food, and we had a game to catch.  We let her know that we had to cancel our food, get the check and get out of there.  She was very apologetic, and came back a minute later to inform us that they were covering the tab for the whole group of 8 people.  This was very surprising, and totally unnecessary, but much appreciated.  Of course, as we were gathering our things and leaving the table, the food showed up.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Perfect spot for a casual happy hour or weekend drinks with friends on the patio. Its a nice little escape from reality and you instantly feel on vacation. The drinks are strong. The prices are cheap and the location is convenient for walking to your next drunken spot. It's not a place you'd crave for a mexican dinner but great bar food and mexican eats and drinks."}
{"text":"Went there to the new location. The new location has promise and very clean looking so far. The bathrooms should have been updated (TV) and made larger. The waitress was not really friendly or rude just neutral. I used a groupon and the manager took care of it."}
{"text":"Their food pretty much sucks and the service is about the same as the food.  They do have a nice outdoor patio area that is right on Scottsdale Blvd. that's nice to get drunk on.  Bottom line this is a happy hour / drinking spot.  Eat somewhere else then go here."}
{"text":"do you like odd tasting watered down margaritas and mediocre food?   well i've found the perfect place for you."}
{"text":"Came here for a little Cinco de Mayo lunch-action today. It's not my first time at this Salty Senorita location, so I pretty much knew what to expect.   As a solo diner, I just pulled up a bar stool and sat at the bar. Service was actually phenomenal! I didn't catch the bartender's name, but she was awesome. Extremely attentive, and friendly.   I arrived a bit earlier around 11:30am, as I expected it could get busy today. I chose Salty for two reasons: a) It's Cinco and I wanted some good mexican grub b) I wanted to earn some frequent flyer points in the Dining Rewards program  First of all, since it's been a while I've been here.... they have a new menu. It's a large one-pager. Alot of things seemed to be missing... like chimichangas! No Chimis?? But the bartender told me they could make any burrito a chimi.   And $1.99 for chips and salsa?!? I thought those used to be free? sheesh...   Oh well, I'm expensing this meal anyways... so I got the chips & salsa, diet coke, and the grilled chicken burrito.   The burrito was fabulous... and fresh tasting. On the side was a large serving of refried beans. BUT.... I was rather surprised to see a $9.99 burrito being served in a cheap red basket. Kind of a turn-off... A $10 burrito deserves a plate.   I asked the server if that was now customary to serve their food in baskets -- but she said it was just for cinco. Apparently it makes it easier for them to clean up.   (I can understand maybe later during the drinking hours -- but not during lunchtime.)  Food was decent, service was awesome.... I'm giving 3 stars because I feel as though they're nickel & diming customers by charging for chips & salsa and putting $10 burritos in red baskets. Boo!"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy going to Salty Seniorita -- but maybe cause that was like 5 yrs ago or so, when it was alot busier!  I dunno. It just isn't the same for me anymore. I'm hopeful... and I still keep givin' them an annual chance; but after a recent visit here, we probably won't be goin back for a while.   We're always drawn by the thought of their \"used to be so good\" fundido queso dip. Meh. Now it's pretty bland and a bit soupier.   We went during happy hour -- so all the appetizers were half off. Again, we had the fundido (meh!) and the Girl in every port platter (which basically was their sampler platter). The sampler platter was normally $15 -- which I don't think is worth that. It was alright, but nothing crazy.   My margarita was $4 for happy hour, and my husband's beer was $2. Not bad... can't go wrong with a Coors Light. My marg was pretty weak and watered down.   All in all... pretty similar food experience since our last visit. (Seriously a year ago.)  But... service was kinda annoying. We had a server in training, who was being shadowed by her \"trainer\". So literally we got questioned on everything twice - over and over and over and over -- it was ridiculous. The server in training was doing fine; it was just redundant double-checking on the other server's part.   Again, okay food wise -- I wouldn't want to pay the regular prices though for their appetizers.   Happy Hour was 3pm to 7pm. Go there then.  Also they participate in the US Airways Dividend Miles Dining program. (Glad I got some miles...)"}
{"text":"Lets be honest - This is not a place you are going to come because of the awesome food and decor.   We went twice in the week we spend in Scottsdale and both times had phenomenal and fast service. The patio had a great atmosphere with everybody socializing and you definitely can't beat their happy hour menu ($4 margaritas, yes please!)  The food is bar food, so don't come searching for one of the best meals of your life. However, the servers kept our chips and salsa (yum) well stocked and the table side guacamole was great.   I believe this will be our hangout for many more spring trainings to come."}
{"text":"This place was great for happy hour, especially the patio area.   We had the taquitos which were ok, but it's happy hour so expectations aren't very high when it comes to food. The margarita was pretty good, but I'm no margarita expert. (vodka-tonic kind of girl)...   I had fun here, but I was but a tourist out there for a few days to get some r&r."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa here are dangerous, many an appetite has been dashed upon their craggy contours, so beware matey.    Arrrr.  I'm a pirate.    But yeah, the Salty kitchen in general has been good to me.  No complaints anytime that I've eaten here, but it's been too long for me to conjure up any specific details of what was good beside the chips and salsa.  As for the margaritas, most of the time I'm already liquored up before I get here, so I'm probably not the most reliable judge.  I just remember that the last time I had one on an empty stomach, (and after drinking earlier) it flat out knocked me on my ass. I woke up the next morning on the bathroom floor next to the toilet bowl! haha.   That hasn't happened to me in a long time my friends.    So yes, I'll have to try a margarita at lunch sometime when I'm dead sober and report back.   Moving along, it's no secret that I'm a fan of patios, but be careful here, some of the misters will drip drip drip all over the table.    The weekend night crowd is your 20s early 30s meat-market set, nothing particularly special here.  Lunch and dinner is more mixed.  Two years ago, as far as I could tell this place was shit-hot on the weekends.  These days however, it seems that good portion of their business has been siphoned off by the Dos Gringos that opened up last year further down the road at Baseline & Greenfeld.   Could be the Gilbert Gestapo DUI nazis too, the economy, who knows.    I did spend Cinco de Mayo here in 2007, had an ok time.  Again I haven't been to the Salty on a weekend night for a while, so I'm not the best reference, anyone else want to weigh in?"}
{"text":"This review is based only on having drinks after a Giants Spring Training game. Loved the location and outdoor patio area to hang out for cocktails! It was super crowded though of course after the game but our waitress was quick and on the ball. Sitting/standing outside was perfect and it was a good crowd overall. So if you're looking for a good place to quench your thirst after a game, I'd definitely recommend the Salty Senorita."}
{"text":"$1 margaritas on game days? Awesome.  They have the coupons at the hostess desk.  Less stars for the smokers on the patio not being policed and the ultra slow service.  Great place to wait though while you're waiting for a table at Oreganos next door."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place for day drinking out on a patio in my mind (and a great place for people watching as well).  First off, they have the best salsa to go along with the chips they bring you as soon as you sit down.  Secondly, and normally I'm a beer guy, but the Undertow Margarita, which has a float of Jack Daniel's on it, is to die for.  Their shredded beef tacos also make the trip worth it.  Each night they seem to have some sort of special to go along with their regular happy hour.  My favorite is Tuesday, with dollar tacos and $5 bucket of Coronitas (Corona's in smaller bottles).  They also have a very solid Sunday brunch, perfect for nursing yourself back to life after a long night out on Saturday.  All the servers that I've come across here (and I've been here a lot) always are very nice, super attentive, and friendly as can be.  As I mentioned, sitting outside on the patio is entertainment in itself, as you can people watch those at Salty's and check out those walking next door to Oregano's and watch all the bikers roll into the Billet Bar as well.  If Old Town isn't your area, try checking out the Salty's in Mesa off of Stapley and the 60 (much larger patio), in North Scottsdale by the airpark, and out on the West Side by the Peoria Sports Complex."}
{"text":"They say everything comes with a grain of salt.   That is the kind of attitude and atmosphere you get from coming to Salty's.  The chicken salad I got is not bad, and they have good margaritas.  The service is pretty fun and you are at a fun atmosphere altogether.  I always see people coming out here after baseball games to chill and relax during Spring Training.  Now....I know why!"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware!!!  There's a reason this place offers a Groupon so often, and everyone seemed to be using one.  Went to the Scottsdale location for lunch, ordered 2 beers (Negro Modelo) 2 \"house\" margaritas, an appetizer (nachos) and an entree from the lunch section (burrito).  Total bill... over $50!!!  Reason: The \"house\" margaritas are charged on your bill as \"Maria's Choice\" and cost $9.50.  Meaning, 2 standard drinks accounted for 40% of the bill..  There is no price on the menu, because, as the waitress indicated, \"The price changes, depending on the tequila used.\"  When asked about the \"House\" margaritas listed on the happy hour menu for $4.  \"Oh, those are different.\"  So apparently, they only offer \"House\" margaritas during happy hour, but don't mention that when you order them any other time.    Worst part, the $9.50 margaritas are served with more ice than marg.  Meaning, after you finish drinking one, there's still a full glass of ice.  Good part (for them) it doesn't take much to finish drinking one.  Big rip off.    Lesson learned:  Take your Groupon, ask the price before you order, or only go for happy hour."}
