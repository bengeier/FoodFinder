{"text":"First off  I just want to say how interesting it is that Crudessence is situated next door to Green Panther ( another vegan, organic restaurant) albeit with different menu variety and much cheaper. If you want a more \"sophisticated\" vegan restaurant, Crudessence is the way to go. I tried the OM burger and had no idea what to expect. The texture and flavor combination of the burger was crazy good, never had I tasted these flavors in that way. The sun-dried tomato I think is what really made it. 

I couldn't finish the meal without ordering their blueberry uncheesecake. Holy. So. good. So refreshing. It was the perfect palate cleanser."}
{"text":"I had an excellent raw meal on my trip to Montreal thanks to Crudessence. The space was small, but cozy. They had a great selection of raw snack items and staples to go as well. Excellent, friendly service."}
{"text":"this restaurant is has great vegetarian and vegan options. I had the exception wrap and it was delicious! The portions are pretty decent, which I was pleasantly surprised about. The prices are between 10$-18$ which is reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality of the ingredients. Service was also great and very efficient! I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a good vegan place to try!"}
{"text":"The food is healthy and original however the sweets are too sweet with the exception of the chocolate moose. The staff are weird though. The waitress seemed more excited when a rich patron came in then if they knew you weren't so rich.The people preparing the food in the back are assholes.Sorry to be so blunt.You have to be nice to people if you want them to be open to a raw foods diet.Its a expensive though but not so expensive then some of the other restaurants. Yeh all I can say is they are a bunch of snobs."}
{"text":"Wow this place is incredible. We had an incredibly tasty healthy dinner. I could not possibly complain about anything. The food was delicious, and it was not heavy and the service was great. I wish I lived in this town, I sure hope they come to So Cal soon!"}
{"text":"Blissful food that starts a party in your mouth with the amazing flavors!! We ate the pesto lasagna with kale caesar salad and for deserts we indulged in brownie, key lime pie and macadamia cookie!! I wish could eat here everyday! Staff is super friendly and ambiance is chic and clean! Must go"}
{"text":"Went out for a special dinner with my 2 girls. I had the raw lasagna.  It was super good. Textures, flavor, and fresh vegetables artfully crafted together   My girls loved the experience and their dishes, too."}
{"text":"If you are a multi-millionaire I suggest you eat all your meals at this place for about 3 months or more and transform your life. The entire concept and food is absolutely unbelievably wonderful.

However the prices require you to be extremely well off financially to eat there as much as you would need to heal your body completely, and if already in fairly great health to become extraordinarily healthy.

Anyone who is not yet a multi-millionaire can at least visit and be inspired."}
{"text":"We had the pesto lasagna and the pad Thai. Pretty clever re-inventions as raw, vegan, gluten-free dishes, but these do have a distinct taste to them. I was surprised that I didn't taste more peanut in the pad Thai and was looking for more garlic in the kale Caesar salad. I withheld one star because the dishes were pricey. I appreciate that it's high quality food, but it's all veggies."}
{"text":"I love their food but seriously these guys are slower than molasses. I ordered a smoothie with absolutely nothing happening in the kitchen, literally one table busy and already eating and it took 15 minutes to work the vita mix?   This is not the first time I've had takeout issues at this particular location, but aside from that, eat in service is good and arrives within a reasonable time frame.

Highly recommend the tacos, the lasagna, the doux-vert smoothie and the pad thai. Expensive but delicious."}
{"text":"I was unsure going to that place, vegetarian restaurants been often too bland, so a raw vegetarian place... 

Not so with Crudessence. It has a good cuisine, with character and personality that was enjoyable.

Next time I'm in Montréal, I'll go back!"}
{"text":"I had heard really great things about the food here. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the service. Went to get take out for lunch they think nothing of making people wait. I was standing at the counter for at least 10 minutes with no service. Finally when the server did show up she insisted on serving someone else first. I explained that I was on my lunch break and that I'd already been waiting for some time. Her response was snide and unapologetic. I'm so disappointed. Was really hoping to make this my new workday lunch spot."}
{"text":"+ cute little place in old montreal, nice music, pleasant staff 
- extremely expensive for what you get, salad wasn't fresh at all, hard to get there"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan eater, but my friend invited me to go there after I pulled 2 all nighters, so I decided to give it a try for the sake of my skin and health.
We went there on a tuesday at around 3 pm, so there was plenty of free places. To start, since I didn't know much about the vegan cuisine, I ordered the curry lentil soup and the waitress brought it out with 2 small biscuits on a plate. I tasted the soup and it was great. The biscuits were tasty too. Then, I ordered the pad thai and also the mojito drink. The pad thai was like a big bowl of fancy salad... it was okay.. I mean, for the price, I could have made something similar for cheaper. Also, it wasn't as spicy at all. As for the mojito drink, it was wonderful. I liked it and finished it almost instantly. Then, for desserts, we decided to try the discovery plate. It was a plate with 4 sample cakes and some ice cream in the middle. I shared it with my friend and it wasn't that great. I am a dessert lover and i was kinda let down by that. To accompany it, we both ordered the latte and it was made with almond milk. You can barely taste the coffee there, it tasted as if they mixed instant coffee with the warm milk, so it was definitely not worth at all. The bill ended up to be kinda pricy for a lunch(80$ for 2).
Will I come back? Maybe yes, just for the soup and the mojito, but definitely not for the dessers or the pad thai.
Will I become a vegan? Err no."}
{"text":"Before I went to Montreal for a minibreak, I asked my friend what he recommended. He said \"Crudessence! Better raw food than anything you'd even find in New York!\"

And wow was he right! I am in LOVE with this place and would definitely go back to Montreal just to eat here again! I had the mushroom cannelloni (wow!) and the BLT (still dreaming about this sandwich). For dessert I had the tiramisu, which was serious heaven.

The decor was beautiful and had their cookbook not been in French I would've snatched it up in a second.

The price point is typical of raw places. Make sure to make a reservation if you go for dinner - it gets super busy and we actually ended up coming back the next day for lunch since we were not getting a seat.

The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is that my friend's side salad for her meal was super pathetic - just spinach and celery. what the heck kind of side salad is that??? and for a raw vegan restaurant?? should have been way way awesomer."}
{"text":"My wife is vegetarian and we're constantly trying to find *good* veg spots to out for lunch/dinner. This was definitely a win with super tasty food across the board. It's not cheap but you definitely get what you pay for here. The true testament is that I'd recommend this to anyone -- both vegetarians and meat-eaters since the menu is unique with such a broad mix of flavours, ingredients, etc."}
{"text":"Love this vegan/raw restaurant - great for a casual lunch or dinner! And the food is fantastic! Recommend the Om burger and the Warrior smoothie - was an amazing combination!"}
{"text":"Restaurant biologique exemplaire en ce qui concerne la saine alimentation, Crudessence pousse davantage la « bonne manière » de se nourrir en ne privilégiant que des repas végétaliens (aucune produits ou sous-produits animaux), vivants (aucune cuisson) et sans gluten. Il faut en partie remercier l'ingéniosité créative des cuisiniers (fortement sollicitée), pour en arriver à des résultats d'une aussi grande variété. C'est dans ce genre de restaurant que l'on se rend vraiment compte des infinies possibilités culinaires nutritives.

Salades aux vinaigrettes maison, sandwichs divers dont celui au thon (remplacé par des goémons/algues)...burgers gorgés de légumes... Auriez-vous cru possible de manger un jour lasagne, spaghetti, pâté chinois, crêpe sauvage, brownie, crème glacée, mousse au chocolat et tarte au sucre, sans un seul oeuf, et sans le moindre soupçon de produits laitiers?... Eh bien vous trouverez tout cela, et bien plus encore...et la différence gustative n'est pas tant flagrante que délicieuse. Certes il existe un fromage, mais il est à base de cajous....

Le restaurant est vraiment petit, mais l'espace judicieusement occupé; de toute manière, il y a un comptoir à emporter où, en attendant sa commande, l'on peut s'asseoir et prendre le temps de découvrir une boisson santé. Le Smoothie Cosmique aux fraises, banane, sirop d'érable et lait de chanvre? Ou encore, l'élixir Bee Buz au lait d'amande, banane, pollen d'abeille, miel, curcuma, cayenne, gingko biloa et cannelle? Ça rince les tripes, et le corps en redemandera. L'on peut aussi s'en tenir au thé fermeté au kombucha (excellent pour le système immunitaire)... Dommage qu'il n'y ait pas de vrai café... car rien, en terme de goût, ne pourra le battre, pas même le café de chicorée et orge torréfiés, qui n'est pas sans rappeler vaguement, très vaguement... la bière?...

Franchement, il y a des plats pour tous les goûts... L'on en ressort l'intérieur ravigoté et assurément alcalinisé... Le reste des découvertes vous revient...

Insolite : Shooter de jus de gerbe de blé! Ça goûte ce que sent l'herbe fraîchement coupée!.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here as a change of pace from Panthere Verte (next door). Where PV is like a cantine, Crudessence is fine dining. The food truly is amazingly well-prepared and fresh and wonderful (there's also a hot menu if you're not totally down with raw, but really, do try the raw). The only downside is the very steep price tag that comes attached (I once had a $25 lunch here)... Which is probably why you won't see me here too often, except the occasional dinner, but the price does reflect the ingredients in this case.

You gotta try this place even just once."}
{"text":"A meal that left me feeling very satisfied. I am surprised by the creativity of ingredients of this raw food restaurant."}
{"text":"I love vegetarian food, I make very good ones. But crudescence doesn't have a clue how to make it. No taste, no gourmet experience... I tried to eat a pizza made with buckwheat flour, awful. I would have needed a chainsaw to cut the \"dough\". And for the rest, I had to bring myself to ask for salt and pepper to make it taste something. After the meal, I went home and ordered a pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian food makes you realize how tasteful vegetarian dishes are , the falafel sandwich and dishes of all sorts are not to miss , the desserts made from natural ingredients makes u crave for more , I will come back soon"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at their loft so I don't rant and rave or take groups there anymore.
I like that they are sticking to their guns on the raw.The food is very healthy but expensive. Mind you it is not more expensive then some of the fancier non organic upscale restaurants in Montreal. It is tastefully decorated. The raw chocolate moose is sooo good.
The staff are generally nice but once I went the service was very slow. And the server forgot to include the desert I ordered and was going to charge for it anyways which I found kinda weird."}
{"text":"i havent been to many vegan raw places.  They are extremely thoughtful and creative. 

The food is tasty but it was so salty i couldn't finish it.

maybe its better on a good day

eeekk"}
{"text":"Je ne savais pas trop à quoi m'attendre. Je n'avais jamais osé essayer la cuisine végétalienne même si elle m'intriguait depuis longtemps. Je me suis finalement aujourd'hui sur l'heure du lunch et me suis régalé! 

Tout est absolument savoureux. Tous les plats offerts au menu sont végétaliens, crus, bios et sans gluten. Au menu régulier s'ajoute un menu saisonnier qui offre de très belles options également dont certains plats chauds pour ceux qui ne seraient pas prêts à faire un pas aussi grand. *Il est à noté aussi que le local sur Rachel étant plus petit que celui au centre ville offre un peu moins de choix au menu.

Une tonne de smoothies, jus, élixirs, et boissons chaudes maison sont disponibles. Le Immuniterre est particulièrement bon.

Pour ce qui est des plats, on retrouve des sandwichs, des wraps, des pizzas, des lasagnes, etc. Le Om Burger est délicieux.

Tout est frais, savoureux et tellement nourrissant. Que ce soit les pains, les fruits séchés, les laits de noix, les yaourts et autres, tout est fait sur place. D'où le prix un peu plus élevé des plats (sans dire cher non plus).

Mes coups de coeur vont aux desserts: la tarte au chocolat cru et bananes avec croûte de macadam est un incontournable. Le gâteau au faux-mage est également très bon.

Un coup de coeur assurément."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Tiny portions. Awkward service. I do not recommend the cheesecake either, it's tiny, dry, and it was served with half-frozen blueberries..."}
{"text":"Okay, my bad. I came here on a Friday night with a group of 6, hoping to snag a table just by showing up. They could not accommodate, so we popped off to one of the other nearby veggie places, saving Crudessence, with its relatively small dining area for another time.

And so ages passed, and the next morning we came with a contingent of but 3, my vegetarian-inclined co-workers, and lo were we seated swiftly close to their opening time in the morning.

I ordered a breakfast burrito, and the greenest smoothie they could possibly produce. My dining pals ordered a crepe and one of the sandwiches respectively.

I don't hate raw food. It's deceptively filling, and generally makes me feel pretty good and refreshed, never over-full and gross. But I feel like there's a limited arrangement of dehydrated flax, cashew paste, avocado spread and a few various other raw staples that are ever employed by these full-raw restaurants. Case in point: The burrito, crepe, and sandwich came, and looked very visibly like slightly different arrangements of the same base components. Sprouts galore!

It is was good and satisfying, and the smoothie was about what I'd expected. I felt great after eating it, which I think is an important and underrated quality for a meal to possess. But ultimately, it was highly reminiscent of just about every raw meal I've had anywhere else over the years. Didn't stand out as a reason to go to *this place* in particular.

It also took... quite a long time to prepare.

Anyway. Quality food. Good and tasty. Great for a detox every now and then. But not an overwhelmingly excellent culinary experience."}
{"text":"We went there today for lunch for the first time and it was just amazing and on top of that raw vegan :-)

It was so good that we came back for dinner the same day. The appetizers , main courses and deserts that we tried were really good."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. We ordered the cheese platter, California wrap and the OM burger. I enjoyed the cheese and California wrap a lot. They are so good."}
{"text":"Beautiful good! Feels alive and nourishing.
There certainly is passion here. 
I appreciate how clean the restaurant is and how the presentation is always a work of art! 
There deserts are also incredible.
It's a shame the staff can be pretentious!"}
{"text":"We thought that coming to a city the size of Montreal would offer many whole food plant options.  Unlike New York, Chicago or San Francisco, Montreal had little to offer.  The one huge exception, that we simply stumbled upon, is Crudessence.  

The food offerings were traditional raw with some interesting twists.  The Om burger was amazing.  We also enjoyed the sushi, crepes, Caesar salad, wrap and \"cheesecake\", each bite more delectable than good reason would come to expect.  It was so delicious that we ate here two evenings and the discovery lunch on our way to the Museum of Fine Art.

The staff was exceptionally attentive and knowledgeable.  When we asked a particularly difficult question about preparation, the chef was out in a flash to explain.  That is service.

The garden location was surprisingly bright and cheery.  The restaurant focuses on clean lines in keeping with the natural food.

All in all, a fabulous experience in a sea of fast food and, worse yet, fast vegetarian food.

We also enjoyed some organic wine"}
{"text":"If you are a rich bunny rabbit this is the place for you. I was not comfortable in this place. My problem, yes. Creamy tomato soup served cold: Disappointed. Crackers like tree bark: tasty but tough to chew. Sandwich of salad tasty but blah blah blah. We all should eat healthy. This place is expensive. I'm out. I'll make my creative salads at home and save $50.00."}
{"text":"This place is really great you need to experience it for yourself.  Very fresh, very yummy just come in and try it out for yourself....................................
.................................."}
{"text":"Crudessence is THE authority in raw and vegan and gluten free food, this is serious bizness here!
Be ready for an adventure of the senses...Try the pad thai salad with raw zucchini spaghetti or the delicious lasagna with pistachio pesto...

Oh and please do indulge with the lemon tart made with avocado mousse...It will make you want to be raw vegan for the rest of your life. 

They also have amazing fresh juices so if you need a pick me in in the middle of the afternoon, you know where to go! 

Most of all I love how I feel after a meal at crudessence: full but light, energized and full of life!
We need more of \"crudessence\" like restaurant in Montreal! 
That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Malgré l'évolution des moeurs sur l'alimentation biologique, c'est un autre cap que de mettre ses pieds dans un établissement végétalien aux aliments sans gluten.

Et c'est à ce jour l'une de mes plus belles rencontres culinaires.

Pour les plus créatifs, je vous invite à vous pencher sur ce type de cuisine, à base d'aliments non cuits dont crus. 

Le restaurant est situé à proximité du mont-royal. Il vaut mieux privilégier l'accès par bus, par métro il faut bien marcher 10 à 20 minutes.

Côté cuisine, comme je le disais, c'est excellent. 
Commencement donc par un trio de tapas avec comme boisson de l'eau, colorée qui interpelle mais qui ne change rien à son goût.

Pour le plat, j'ai opté pour des wraps, lesquels étaient garnis d quinoa et millet au chipotle, avocat parmi d'autres aliments. Habitué aux wraps de poulet et au wraps de boeuf, je ne regrette rien à mon choix. 

En dessert, la tarte à la lime a séduit mon attente. Ce goût de fraicheur a parfaitement clôturé ce repas dont je garde un mémorable souvenir.

Petit plus, dès lors votre repas fini, vous pouvez déambulé de l'autre côté du restaurant qui s'apparente à une boutique ou vous trouverez par exemple du chocolat, ou de nombreux ouvrages qui introduisent à la fermentation parmi d'autres techniques."}
{"text":"Une belle découverte si un lunch est 30$ figure à votre budget. Smoothie au gingembre et Pad Thai cru végé particulièrement inspirés. Un plaisir pour les papilles, frais et unique en son genre. On nous y sert avec le sourire, sans aucune prétention. Je vous recommande la café au café Olimpico par la suite, un \"must\" du mile end."}
{"text":"Good restaurant for Vegan. Plates are very well presented and looks (and are) yummy! The Chef must be very creative. I am not a vegan, far from that, but I really enjoyed my meal and the time I spend there. Must try once in your life, even if it's just for the experience. No wifi, and it's a little expensive (cost me 45$ for lunch) but I guess it's part of the vegan deal."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit here. I went for an early dinner on Sunday with a friend. When we arrived, the restaurant was dead and we got seated next to the washroom in the back. She had the pad thai and miso soup. I had the dhal soup and OM burger. From the reviews I had high expectations for the burger, but was not satisfied in the end. There were too many sprouts, dry and not much flavor. Although I liked the dhal soup it was full of flavor, but was not served warm. Overall the service was good, friendly staff. The prices seem high for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais essayer le Crudessence. Je n'ai pas été déçue par cette succursale près de l'université Concordia. 

Le décor est simple et élégant. Le service était très aimable.

J'ai pris le wrap au quinoa chipotle avec la salade du jour (kale et sésame). Côté portion, le wrap est largement suffisant, même pour un gros appétit. Pas besoin de commander la salade en plus (qui était plutôt ordinaire, à mon avis). Le wrap, quant à lui, était excellent! J'ai bien aimé la combinaison nori et feuille de riz (il faut dire que j'ai un faible pour le goût du nori).

Mon copain a pris la lasagne. Bien qu'en y goûtant, j'ai été surprise que ça soit froid (duh! on est au CRUdessence!), elle était vraiment bonne!

Pour dessert on a partagé un banana split, qui renfermait tous les ingrédients idéals d'un dessert: brownies, crème glacée, fruit! Le tout était excellent! La crème glacée chocolat/menthe (mon parfum favori) était délicieuse, ainsi que les brownies.

Seul bémol: le prix un peu élevé."}
{"text":"Healthy food indeed!
Crudessence has a manu packed with healthy raw vegetarian options. The food is good and flavorful. The water is chlorophyll-infused, that was an interesting touch.
The service is fast and friendly. 

They have an outside sitting option. Great if you want to grab a bite and keep your furry friend with you on a summery day!

A little bit on the pricey side, I understand is all organic, maybe that itself can justify the price. I went there with my husband and for 2 wraps we paid $30 plus taxes and tip."}
{"text":"One of the best acai bowls I've had- great texture and really good toppings (granola, gogi berries, coconut flakes, banana, and cocoa nibs)!"}
{"text":"Manger sainement,
Faire le plein de nutriments, 
Avoir un bon choix de smoothies ou d'elixirs,
Carte de fidélité pour ces derniers justement,
Ne pas savoir quoi choisir sur le menu tellement que les plats proposés sont originaux, 
Avoir un service aimable, attentionné et avec bonne foi
Place assez petite où l'accent et l'effort sont davantage mis sur la qualité des plats que sur la décorations. Malgré tout, on ne se sent pas confiné.
... 
Quoi qu'il en soit, Crudessence est une belle découverte!"}
{"text":"I don't mean to compare but this place gives Aux Vivres a run for it's money. I think that their food is so much more flavorful and inventive, but their desserts are lacking. Their nachos and their tuna wrap was to die for. For those who believe that healthy food cannot be delicious. Eat your words fools! This place totally disproves that silly idea."}
{"text":"My poor intrepid steak-and-potatoes partner had to accompany me here with his friend. I don't think he was too upset by the end, as the food is quite filling and delicious. I had the Champion Wrap, which was much more spicy than I expected (possibly because I kept putting more and more of the lime-jalapeno cream on it!) and was filled with goodness. 
Our friend had the Pad Thai, which she generously shared with us both. I'm not sure what the crunchy bits were, but they added quite a bit of interest. I'm a lover of raw food, so it was tasty and interesting (recipe, please?). 
My intrepid partner had the dahl, which he said was good, but could have been warmer (the problem with raw or mostly raw food, especially when the temperature outside is well below freezing). 
We also had gluten-free beers brewed in Quebec that were actually quite good. We had the IPA style.
To top everything else, she insisted that I have a dessert to celebrate my then-passed birthday, so (at the server's suggestion) we had the banana split. Who knew that something vegan could be so good. The split had the requisite bananas topped with three scoops of \"ice-cream\" (cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla), surrounded with vegan (raw?) brownie bits and topped with a raspberry coulis. Can I tell you? This was one of the most delicious desserts I have ever had. 
I was surprised that the restaurant had the lime-jalapeno cream, then even more surprised that the \"ice cream\" included cinnamon! This was the kind of surprise that warms a Texan's heart - at least the heart of a Texan who loves her jalapenos, mexican cinnamon ice cream, and has a love-affair with vegan, raw and vegetarian foods. Quebec, who knew? I wish we had a Crudessence in Texas. Bring one to Austin - please?"}
{"text":"This is an inspiring place for raw vegan food.  Their aesthetic was clean, simple, modern and comfortable.  I was awed when they served us our carafe filled with chlorophyl treated water.  The chlorophyl dye danced and made a beautiful sea green color.  As for their food, we ordered the cheese plate, japanese miso soup, and black bean noodle bowl.  I loved all three.  They had one \"chedder\" cheese, a specially made cheese, which was outstanding.  So complex, a wonderful hard cheese that I've never experienced elsewhere.  Considering I've tried countless vegan cheeses and shops in Brooklyn, there is no match to that cheese.  I wish they would allow us to buy it in bulk.  The miso soup was ok, I've had better.  The noodle bowl was delicious.  We ended up purchasing the raw cookbook, and I've made a couple of items so far which were pretty good."}
{"text":"This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here 15 minutes before their closing time (we had no idea they close so early on a Friday night), and got friendly and fast service. The server was very attentive and gladly explained the items on the menu. 
I had the om burger while my brother had the lasagna. I enjoyed my meal and would recommend the burger to anyone. My brother, being a typical guy, would've preferred to have his dinner hot, but I think he was just being difficult - his lasagna was delicious!  
Overall, a fun experience and I can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, and it's a fun creative culinary feat for them to create these beautiful looking dishes without using the normal staples. As someone who cooks gluten free, I can appreciate their resourcefulness, and they so artfully present the food. I would say I wasn't quite full by the end, but it was very good!"}
{"text":"Creative,tasty, vegan and gluten free. Excellent!!!

A truly healthy meal and great experience. 

Near McGill University off Sherbrooke."}
{"text":"Descending upon meaty Montreal, I never thought I would be able to find a veggie haven.  This location is the original and gorgeous.  

We ate here for dinner one of the evenings and it blew me away:
-Discovery Plate, a collection of their starters, fantastic, highly recommend, only available after 5PM, but they allowed us the 30 minute lead time
-Crudessence salad, beautiful greens, sprouts, sauerkraut and sprouted hummus
-Hippocrate juice, cukes, celery, pea sprouts, coriander, lemon
-even their water, FREE, a revelation, so much so I ran out to the grocery store to pick up chlorophyll to recreate at home

Skip: Caesar salad, overdressed and flavor was not our favorite

Of course I had to return for take out:
-almond milk, $14 for the large size, if you bring back the bottle, $1 off, great version, not overly sweet from dates, so pure
-om burger, super satisfying
-blt, eggplant bacon, what!?!  Love
-exceptional wrap, so filling from the quinoa and millet, nods to Vietnamese and Japanese 
-cheesecake, made with cashews and coconut oil, crust from brazil nuts and figs, so good

Check out snacks: biscotti and gold rush.

A lot of raw vegan food can be overly salted, but C manages their levels of sodium very well.  All organic and vegan.  This brought me through the times during the trip where I needed fresh and nourishing food - including for lunch and dinner at the airport and on the flight back home.

The cookbook Raw Essence is currently on it's way to me.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Fresh, delicious, nourishing! What an awesome discovery! I also really like that even the sauces are served in reusable stainless steel containers (instead of plastic throwaway containers)."}
{"text":"I have recently decided to go vegan, and this was a great start to my new journey! The organic and vegan food, desserts, and drinks showed me that I can truly enjoy this lifestyle by simply replacing all the unnecessary junk with healthier alternatives. My friend and I had the sweet potato soup with cumin as an appetizer, for our main course she ordered the Om Burger and I ordered the quinoa wrap with chipotle, red pepper, and avocado. They tasted absolutely delicious and were perfectly filling. We also enjoyed a nice bottle of French red wine, and shared an absolutely scrumptious blueberry \"un\" cheesecake! 

I will definitely go back soon and try other items on the menu! Not only does this restaurant have a lot to offer, but it's a cute little place with a clean-cut, chic design."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Stopped in for sushi and came back later that evening for coffee. Sushi was awesome, as well as smoothies, but I would pass on the coffee next time (bitter, overpriced, and took awhile)."}
{"text":"So healthy, gluten free and delicious!! Service is kind of slow but very friendly and the food is on point!"}
{"text":"I like their lunch express which includes a soup, a main dish and a small dessert: The Dahl soup is warm and spicy hot. The roll is huge, it's stuffed with lots of vegetables. The eggplant bacon inside the roll is flavourful and so is the nut pate. The roll is served with a fresh salad on the side. Which makes a satisfying and filling meal. Raw food are usually made with a lot of nuts but some dishes on their menu can be requested nut free."}
{"text":"I had takeout for lunch here recently.  I try to eat healthily on an everyday basis, but when I'm on vacation, I tend to eat unhealthily.  I eat whatever I fancy, even if it is all carbs and fat and no vegetables, haha.  So after a heavy meal the night before, I was on the hunt for a healthy AND delicious place.  I found Crudessence here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did because the food was tasty and it made me feel virtuous that I was eating my vegetables.   

It's a vegan restaurant and most of the stuff here is raw, but they do have some cooked elements (like they cook their quinoa and millet).

I had the Faux Tuna Wrap with a side salad ($15.25).  The \"tuna\" was almond pâté and I think they mixed in some dulse or kelp to give it that marine taste.  It's wrapped in a sheet of nori and then wrapped in rice paper.  The filling also contained red cabbage, capers, black olives, and alfalfa sprouts.  There were also larger sprouts (maybe pea sprouts? in between the nori and the rice paper).  It was fairly tasty, although it didn't taste like tuna at all.  I felt that it could have had more of the almond pâté though.  The wrap was kind of dry because of all the vegetables and not enough of the almond pâté.  

The salad was lettuce, red cabbage, shredded carrots, cucumber, ribbons of beets, red peppers and alfalfa sprouts.  The vegetables were fresh except for one piece of lettuce that was brown and wilted.  I had the Tibetan dressing which was fat-free.  It was really watery because it didn't have any oil.  It was flavourful and had a nice tang to it though.

Overall the food was good, but truth be told I was hungry again in an hour because of the low protein content of the meal."}
{"text":"After spending a few years in Vancouver, my wish was to find as great raw + veggie restaurants in Montreal. The Crudessence on Mackay doesn't disappoint. I went there with my boyfriend and was happy to find a cozy and romantic ambiance for our dinner that was not overly expensive. It's not everyone who likes eating raw, so you need to go to this place knowing that food will just not taste the same way it usually does. We enjoyed their food so much, we even got the cookbook! We ate lasagna (5/5), BLT (4/5) and ate tiramisu and cheesecake. We're already fans. Plus, they have good wine."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I loved it so much. They had a lunch set for 20 dollars, which I believe came with a salad, a main dish, and a dessert, which were all on point (that's super rare!). I'm still a student and can't afford that super often but I go there whenever I can. Their soups are delicious too, I've tried their dhal soup. I hope to try out everything on their menu someday!  One of my favourite vegetarian places (vegan and gluten-free friendly), and will definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great, the overall experience was awesome. The service was excellent (even though we had to wait a little because the actual place is tiny and has very little seating). 

I love how they start by serving us some free fresh green water that has a few drops of chlorophyll in it! Great touch. 

The soup is delicious and the play on my pad Thai was really nice too. My friend's zucchini lasagna and kale salad was also super. I would go back for more!"}
{"text":"An excellent find here in Montreal. A good variety on the menu and all vegan. I am not a big fan of raw food but these guys do it well. I had the Om Burger with the aubergine \"bacon.\" The pricing seems a bit high but the quality is worthy of it."}
{"text":"I went twice in the same week, it was that good. What I love about this place is that it's organic, vegan and gluten-free, and their produce is very fresh, which is always a bonus.

I love the interior space; the front showcases food items that you can buy to go such as nuts and Kombucha. The back space while small, is the main dining area and it's gorgeous! It's super bright with whitewashed walls and vibrant art. I could totally take that whole look and move it into my own house, I like it so much. I wonder if the chef will come with it?

Crudessence has a varied menu, that currently includes a seasonal menu. On Sunday, I ordered the Vert-Dur juice (kale, parsley, fennel, apple, celery, lemon, ginger) and it was very tasty in a green sort of way. My friend ordered the Kombu-Mojito (pineapple, mint, lemon, agave, kombucha) and THAT was fabulous. It was incredibly refreshing and you could taste the every ingredient.  

I ordered a dish off the seasonal menu whose name I forget (sorry), but it involved a flax and Chia seed crepe with sprouts and avocado and it was bursting with flavor. It was accompanied by sprouted black rice and hummus. The seasonal menu had 3-4 items, all of which looked delicious so I'll have to go back and try them out. 

On my second visit, I tried the Pad Thai (Daikon and zucchini noodles, fresh vegetables, spicey tamarind sauce and dehydrated sprouted buckwheat). This dish was equally delicious, and quite light for a hot summer day. I would order it again!

The wait staff is friendly and happy to make recommendations, and service is pretty quick. Price-wise, it can be a little pricey if you're going for lunch (depends what you get), however the portions are quite good and the food is fresh. It's the perfect, healthy alternative to all the crap that's out there."}
{"text":"In a word, AMAZING! This place is a hidden gem, tucked on a back street near McGill. Slightly off the beaten path, especially for tourist, Crudessence is now my go-to restaurant in Montreal.

The food is stellar. We shared the cannelloli, miso soup, pesto pasta and stuffed mushrooms. A bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it because the food is just that good. I live gluten-free and dairy-free and this was the very first restaurant that I have been to that I could eat every single thing on the menu. I was in heaven. 

Then we ordered dessert. It only got better from here. We got the brownie a la mode and the blueberry uncheesecake. My boyfriend, who is an avid cheesecake eater, loved this - and it was vegan! It had a fantastic consistency and the crust was delicious and crunchy. I think we finished it in about four bites. The brownie was fabulous as well. Packed with nuts and chocolatey goodness, topped with ice cream. Yum!

After our meal, I was so impressed that I ordered their avocado wrap to go so I could have it for lunch the next day at work. The wrap was by far my favorite thing we ate! I only ate half of it one day so I could save the rest for the next day. 

They also have a shop where you can purchase a bunch of raw snacks and treats. These are definitely a little on the expensive side, but super tasty as well. I bought the vegetable crackers, which are super healthy, low in calories and perfect topped with hummus or another vegan spread. I also got the Halva which is a great little sweet snack which I usually eat post-workout (these are packed with protein). Lastly, I bought the granola. I have yet to open the bag, but it looks amazing. I can't wait to try it. 

Check out their website too - you can order their products online and they even have some of their recipes.

Will DEFINITELY be going back! I wish it was closer so I could go their everyday!

{"text":"My new sick obsession... Ever wonder what live, raw, organic, vegan could taste like?  You will be pleasantly surprised!  Eating here is more than putting food in your mouth and chewing...it is a culinary experience that leaves you elightened both in the belly and in the mind:) As a dairy-intollerant sufferer for many years, this place is my haven!  A place where I am free to choose anything on the menu and indulge in EVERY delectable dessert is truly blissful.  Trust me...once is not enough!"}
{"text":"Not my first choice for a meal on a cold day, but it was near the art gallery and I was craving something healthy-ish. What luck that there is not one but there are TWO vegan restos in the area! I wanted to order one of their veggie burgers, but the server told me they did not receive their bread that day... So I was left to order chili and a side kale salad for something warming and more substantial than your standard raw food fare. 

For a meal I can rather easily make at home, it was very expensive! I'm surprised because the quality was meh, the taste was meh, but the price was bloated. As for service, the waiter was nice/attentive, but the hostess was borderline rude as she did not even acknowledge when we thanked her and said goodnight. How strange because she was polite when we walked in, but not so after we paid... I felt we should have gone to the Green Panther next door as it was actually full of people rather than empty like Crudessence was when we initially walked by."}
{"text":"Location: On St. Viateur, not too far from my bestest coffee place, Olimpico. Street parking is available. The closest subways are likely Mont-Royal and Laurier, both on the orange line.

The place: It's very small, and there are two communal tables and some bar seating. I think this is mostly a take-out place, and you likely wouldn't go during peak lunch/dinner hours.

The goods: I've had their Pad Thai and their lasagna, as well as elixirs. Personally, I haven't had any disappointing or negative experiences where their food is concerned. Everything has always been fresh and flavourful. The Pad Thai is refreshing while the lasagna is a little on the heavier side. Both are delicious but I have a soft spot for the lasagna. Just a head's up - it's served cold, NOT hot. Their fresh elixirs and juices are also great. 

Service: Good. There's basically only one person at the counter, who will bring you a bottle of Chlorophyl water and take your order.

Price point: The only downside to Crudessence is the price. They can be a little expensive so it's not a place that I would go to on a regular basis. 

This is a great option for vegetarians and vegans!"}
{"text":"I dragged my 13 year old vegetable-phobic daughter into this vegan resto for Saturday lunch.  Everything is vegan and a lot of it is raw food.  It's a nice semi-basement space that still is bright and open.  She had a strawberry milkshake made with almond milk that she grudgingly admitted was good.  I had the belle verte green smoothie which tasted mostly of banana with only a hint of \"green\".  My daughter had the BLT sandwich with vegan bacon and I had the exceptional wrap with avocado, quinoa and sprouts.  The wrap was a little bland but livened up with a delicious ginger dipping sauce.  My daughter proclaimed the BLT as ok, but heavy on the sauce and the vegan bacon was not like real bacon.

Service was friendly but very slow.  We waited over 40 minutes for our food.  In teenager mode, my daughter observed \"its raw food, it's not like they have to cook it, what took so long?\"

Overall a 3.5 star experience with bonus points for being good for you. Fairly tasty, super healthy food, but don't go if you're in a rush..."}
{"text":"Is it normal to wait for a smoothie for over 15 minutes when there are only 2 tables filled with people in the entire place? Service was super disappointing and no apology was even given after having to have waited so long to get served for takeout. It almost felt as the priority there was given to the staff socializing amongst each other instead of putting customers first. On another note after having waited this long my smoothie was watered down and bitter...I was in a rush so I just left. Other than this the food is always great at your other locations but the attitude needs to be worked on at this specific location."}
{"text":"Boy did we luck out. We happened to park right in front and as we went back to the car to look for lunch. We went in to check it out and was amazed at what we saw. 

The entrance does not look like much but the inside was great. Roomy bright and spacious. 

The food was equally as good. Well presented and yummy. We have \"burgers\" soup and noodles. All good. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with crudessence. I love their food. Everything is fresh and organic and you simply feel so full of life when walking out of there; as though you just did something very good for your body. They don't just give you regular water, but rather water with chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is basically like \"plant blood\". It's super good for you and the benefits are crazy!  

But but but, I can't stand how expensive it is! I know it's not entirely their fault because organic food is expensive. However their portions can be very small at times. A little piece of zucchini lasagna is $12-$15. I could make an entire zucchini lasagna at home for under $10."}
{"text":"Great raw vegan place. Yes, their menu is overpriced, but you have decent lunch specials. We loved the lentil dahl. Their flax crackers and croutons are amazing as well. 
Crudessence's secret weapon is their salad dressing. I don't know what they put in it, but it's out of this world. Addicting. You're asking for more. It highlights the freshness of their vegetables and sprouts without masking their earthy flavour. I like that they present the dressing separately: you can dose it according to your own preferences. 
I've also had their raw lasagna. Aside from the fact that it's a layered dish, there's not much resemblance to the actual thing. But of course, you can't expect the exact same richness. 
All the desserts I've tried so far were excellent: special mention to the \"cheesecake\". All of us non-vegans were astounded that there was no actual cheese in the thing, because it tasted exactly like a cheesecake. 
You have to try the raw chocolate truffles: they just melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I had lunch on the patio of this restaurant, and really liked it! The server was kind and made excellent recommendations when I asked. I had the Fujiyama sandwich, which was SO flavourful! From the house made bread to the tempeh to the aioli, it was perfectly flavoured. I also ordered Mango Raspberry Lassi, which was fruity and creamy and just the right amount of sweet. I finished off with the Blueberry Un-Cheesecake, which was filling and tasty--dense and creamy with a perfect nutty crust.

Everything is carefully and thoughtfully house-made, and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a fresh dining experience!"}
{"text":"At first I didn't know this resto basically served their food raw and I pretty much ordered dishes that weren't so tasty in my opinion.  My bf had a lasagna which was quite strange (we are used to having our meals cooked). The second time I came with an expert and she told me what to order which was the sandwiches and boyyy were they amazing! Surprisingly filling and had a unique taste! The dessert was great too, I ordered a tiramisu and I was shocked to learn that they did not use  anything non-vegan. I don't understand how they can make a cake without eggs or milk or butter! But it tasted fantastic! I would definitely come back again to eat their sandwiches or pizzas. and also desserts! Service was excellent as well. Very friendly and patient with newbies in a vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"So here's the deal.  I had heard about this place many times before and heard good things.  I had \"un p'tit creu\" in my stomach and needed to fill it; I was studying at Concordia and needed something to satisfy my hunger.  I ordered the Om Burger with butternut cheese.  When I showed up (although I didn't stay very long) the staff was more than nice to me.

Although the food was a bit pricey, they did offer me a student rebate which was a nice surprise.  Anyway, I then walked back to Concordia and ate one of the most delicious things I've ever put in my mouth in my entire life - and believe me, I've put a lot of things in my mouth.  I at first thought of rating this 4 stars because of the price, but let's face it, it's worth every penny.

Saw Crudessence on Mackay.  ATE at Crudessence on Mackay.  I would say, EAT at Crudessence on Mackay."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars
Such small portions! Came here with a bunch of family and although we had an awesome evening, I left the restaurant hungry which is always sad.

The layout of the restaurant is great for groups, we had a whole area to ourselves and since it's a quiet area there was only one other party next to us. I was able to chat with everyone comfortably.

Menu is good, they added a night menu with some different choices from their regular menu. I got the sloppy joe and it was gooooooood. It wasn't hot but it was lukewarm. 
It had great \"mouth feel\".

I also got the chocolate brownie dessert and it was a bit bitter so don't order if you expect something really chocolaty and sweet. I thought it was good but maybe with a smoothie. 
I wish I had gotten one.

Staff was professional and quick. They were really accommodating of our large group which was great. 

Prices seem a bit high to me, it's not affordable yet it's located near Concordia. 
It was nice to try it but I don't think this is a must for me."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went here while spending a night in Montreal.  Wanted to try something a bit different.  Vegetarian/Vegan and Raw?  The verdict was DELICIOUS!  We had a wonderful dinner there.  The food was flavorful and different.  We had the Om Burger and Tacos.  The salad that comes with the Om burger was delicious and the Om Burger itself was ridiculous!  We loved it.  We had a couple of nice glasses of wine which were perfectly matched for our meals.  For dessert, we tried this banana-chocolate cake.  So rich.  Dense with goodness.  Not for the faint of heart - it was bold luscious.  Our waitress was lovely and the atmosphere of the place was cool/trendy.  I would HIGHLY recommend this place to friends who are looking to see how vegetarian/vegan can be done in an amazing way!  Honestly, if I had food like this every night, I would never miss meat."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite vegan spot in the city. I've brought many skeptics here and the verdicts have ranged from reluctant admittance of 'it's not bad' to 'I really liked it, considering it's raw vegan food'. Warning : the service can take a bit long.

Good : The Discovery Plate (appetizer, suffice as a small meal for two), the perfect sampler dish if you have no idea what you're doing. My personal favorites are the Fujiyama and BLT sandwiches...and 10% student discount!

Bad : I've once waited 35 minutes for a take out order...for one Sandwich. It was a bit much considering the food didn't required cooking in the first place. Another time I ordered a sandwich for take out at the counter ( I don't get the packaged ones because I prefer it freshly made). Good news: it was ready in one minute after I ordered! Bad news: It must've been sitting on the counter because the tomato made the sandwich really soggy. These two bad experiences cost them one star. 

Bottom line : You can still eat dessert and not be bloated."}
{"text":"This place is dope! The Pad Thai was super yummy and filling. I also had the chocolate mousse which was decadent. The staff was super nice & helpful navigating the menu. They also get to play their own music & listening to D'Angelo & Frank Ocean was the cherry on top of my experience here."}
{"text":"The best food. Loved everything. The lasagna amazing, the pasta amazing, the burgers amazing. Everything was wonderful and surprisingly filling. The chapati is amazing, I am an addict. Wonderful restaurant. And the kombucha amazing, and teas great too. Don't forget the desserts. Amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. First real meal since we arrived in Montreal. Pad Thai to die for. Tacos and daily special with pesto soup were great."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous - vegan, gluten free, organic.  I had the Om Burger which is mushroom, sun dried tomato, flaxseed & mixed vegetables, served on chapati and garnished with tomato, red onion, lettuce, mustard, ketchup & caper aïoli.  It had very complex flavors.  I had the brownie for dessert. My intent was to eat half and save the other half for another day. That did not work out.  I am in Montreal for 6 days and plan to go back to try another entree."}
{"text":"Extraordinary vegan cheese plate with sprout, beat, and cranberry accoutrement. 

Everything raw but covertly so, we had to ask to confirm this suspicion but were blown away when we learned this was correct. 

Tempeh, jalapeño, sprouts on raw sprouted bread.

Few words were uttered during this meal that were not \"Oh my god.\"

Friendly staff, excellent atmosphere and service. Delicious selection of kombucha (Rise brand). 

Would absolutely visit again."}
{"text":"I'd like to clarify that I'm not vegetarian nor vegan, I visited this restaurant because of my vegetarian girlfriend.

The only thing I can say is that this place is a very-overpriced salad joint. I've seen much more elaborated dishes for almost half the price in Toronto.

Don't take me wrong, if you are vegan, vegetarian or raw food eater maybe you would appreciate more."}
{"text":"Excellent food! With my food restrictions (no sugar, no carbs), this was the paradise! Recommended to everyone who's searching for health food! Really great and original menu."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff, good service and amazing food! For a raw Vegan this place was beyond perfect, it hit every spot perfectly."}
{"text":"Very unique place and a good find for gluten-free. I'm not into the whole vegan/raw food thing, but found the food inticing and delicious (I tried the avocado key lime pie and a blondie). It had a nice ambience, too."}
{"text":"Expérience incomparable ! C'est la meilleure façon de savoir apprécier la cuisine Végétalienne à son apogée!"}
{"text":"I love vegan restaurants and I've heard about that one and unfortunately I had a bad experience :-( 
The waitress was unfriendly and the food I had was not tasty at all.. I ordered a wrap (the last one on the menu, I don't remember the name, but with Kimchi and ginger sauce inside) but I actually couldn't taste any kimchi or ginger. I expected something a bit spicy but nothing. And this wrap is worth 13$, which is pretty expensive for what it is.. I found a lot of other places way much cheaper and really good in comparison with that one :/.."}
{"text":"There are meat-eaters among us who don't feel full unless they've pigged out on some piggy. For those of you who are feeling especially ravenous and want to feel, as the lovely guy seated next to me said, \"Like you've just done something good to your body and soul\" Crudessence is your kind of vegan/raw spot. 

Minimalistic and streamlined decor with a breezy atmosphere, and a small patio in the front, the staff are devout worshippers of a good, healthy meal. They might be slooooooooooow, but they know their product well. There's a wide range of savoury and sweet foods to tempt you, including entrees like tacos and lunchtime items like sandwiches and wraps. 

My lunch: Beautifully stuffed with chipotle quinoa, avocado, lettuce, onion, red pepper, this nori and rice paper wrap was a masterpiece to look at. It was served with a dipping sauce that also doubled as salad dressing for the side salad. 

Had I had room, I would have also ordered the uncheesecake AND the tiramisu. Maybe next time I'll just go straight for dessert. It's still healthy right? Right?"}
{"text":"First, you ought to know that I am addicted to Crudessence in general. I have known this chain since few months now and I have never been that excited about a restaurant. I always want to try something new!

This little gem that just opened in the well-known La Moisson health food store  was much needed in the area and respects the quality that Crudessence has built its name around. The people are joyous to work there and serve you. And as a \"Comptoir Santé\" only, I am amazed at the selection they still offer.

My favorites: Om Burger, The Key Lime Pie and Thei famous Choco Brownie!

---

En premier lieu, vous devez savoir que je suis complétement accro de Crudessence en général. Je n'ai jamais été aussi excitée à propos d'un restaurant. Je veux toujours essayer quelquechose de nouveau!

Ce petit joyau qui vient à peine d'ouvrir dans La Moisson, bien connue ici, était bien attendue dans notre secteur et sait bien respecter la qualité que Crudessence a su délivrer dans les dernières années. Les gens sont heureux de travaviller et de vous servir. De plus, en tant que \"comptoir santé\" seulement, je suis très impressionnée par le choix qui s'y trouve.

Mes coups de coeur: Om Burger, Tarte à la Lime et leur fameux Brownie au Choco!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good!!! My dad and boyfriend who are total carnivores () loooooooove this place also!! Everyone loves it. The food always tastes so fresh. You HAVE to try the desserts also, I swear you will regret not getting dessert if you don't. They even put chlorophyll in their water which is awesome. Every time I go the staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"Always love trying new raw places. Cute restaurant/store that takes up two storefronts. There's a little takeout and product area when you immediately enter.  Lots of different products including coconut oil, pre made foods, drinks, protein powder, books, etc. There's only a small seating area for eat-in dining. When I was there, the same girl who was working the main checkout counter was also the only waitress. The menu has a lot of smoothie and juice options including their home-brewed kombucha. Witnessed a group of 6+ girls just order smoothies during a weeknight dinner service... that will never be me, but the space is definitely one that you want to linger in, especially during the cool Montreal summer evenings. 
Ordered the kale Caesar salad. A good size, had some spicy croutons, and a delicious dressing. The massaged kale was a good consistency.
I would imagine that a raw food restaurant is a tough sell for non-vegans, but the smoothies, juices, and now popular kombucha would definitely attract the skeptics. 
Wish I had the ability to transport the scoby or as they called it -- maman kombucha-- to the U.S. with me!"}
{"text":"I visited this place in Montreal over a weekend. It's a nice little restaurant tucked away on Rue Rachel that has a somewhat rustic feel to it.

The menu is entirely raw and vegan, offering items like sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta dishes, and smoothies. I ordered an appetizer as I was just there for a snack, so I ordered their version of nachos with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream (called 'fiesta' on the menu). The nachos tasted very salty at first, but when paired with the side dips, it was pretty good. The rosemary flavour was pretty prominent in the nachos too.

Next time I go back I'd probably try something else from the menu since there's a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"I am a complete sucker for anything raw and vegan, hence why i have been to Crudessence quite a few times now....

The food is excellent, i have tried a few things on the menu but the stand out dishes for me are the zucchini lasagne, which is so fresh and flavourful, and the kale ceaser salad which is very unique .

However, like so many people have said, the prices are high!! If it was just a bit cheaper,more in line with their competitors, i would come here far more regularly...unfortunately its just that bit too pricey, especially considering the portion sizes.

So if you're looking for something fresh and interesting, this is the perfect place to come, but expect to pay a bit more than you would in other vegan restaurants!"}
{"text":"Dear Crudessence, I didn't come with huge expectations, but I left hugely disappointed anyway. 

I was with a large lunch party, and I had just finished eating not too long before, so I ordered a chai latté and a cookie from the menu. The rest of the table ordered full lunches (salads and stuff, which looked tasty). You'd think that with just a hot drink and a cookie, I'd have received my dish in a timely manner, no? NO. Everyone got their food first, before the obviously frazzled server threw a packaged cookie in front of me on the table - no plate, no napkin, no nothing. Not only was the package basically impossible to open, other than with my teeth, but my latté was rapidly cooling to an unsatisfying lukewarm before I managed to dip a cookie in it. Ooooof. Truly an awkward, unpleasant experience. Like... even a plate to catch my cookie crumbs would have been nice... tiny cookie, too - certainly not what I'd qualify as a menu item... it was really a cookie afterthought... seriously, don't mess with my cookie."}
{"text":"OK, I have to add my review of this location of Crudessence because my review of the downtown location wasn't great. However, this location was a much better experience for me! Not only is it located right next to Jeanne Mance park and the whole mountain, but it's a bit smaller, more intimate and the staff is really on their game. I stopped in for a smoothie (and the complementary chlorophyll-infused water, of course!) before heading off on a long bike ride. Smoothie was EXCELLENT. The vibe was super funky and upbeat. Clean, open atmosphere for a small space, and I was in no hurry to leave. So, yay! Crudessence, you've redeemed yourself. I'll stop in for a smoothie on my way up the mountain anytime."}
{"text":"We stumbled in here on a Sunday early evening and were surprised at how crowded it was. Definitely a spot to have a nice sit down restaurant experience and the feel is not overly casual. The service was definitely lacking though.. once we were seated, we had to flag down someone to take our order and then the wait for the food was pretty long...

We ordered 2 things: The Pad Thai bowl (I'd pass.. it was served cold and too spicy) and the pesto lasagna (HUGE WINNER). Despite also being served cold, the Pesto lasagna was A+ and we got the last one for the day at 6PM! 

They seem to have a nice wine collection here too and the desserts looked fantastic.. great spot for a first date or dinner with a girlfriend. Also amazing for anyone who is health conscious. I would go here alone!

I wonder if it's organic though???"}
{"text":"Awesome.

more Awesome

and then more Awesome

just curious how much blah blah blah needs to be typed in before the review sticks...testing


OK! boom!
prices are high, but when you are green in the pocket, and ready for high octane in the tank, Crudessence is as good a way to go as any other, of the genre, in Montreal. 
Been to all three locations, enjoy them all; particularly fond of the brighter Plateau locales. My favest being the St Viateur location only a couple blks from home. 
Super clean and, generally, wonderful staff.

Plus the best hip healthy eatery packaging in MTL. Kudos Crudessence!

O AND... 10% off the menu items for students!"}
{"text":"I came to Crudessence for dessert (based on Yelp comments) and thus, food-wise, can only comment on their (un)cheesecake. I'm sad to say that I'm not sure what all the hype about is about; bluntly speaking, it tasted like a mixture of coconut oil and sugar. The sauce that came with was a tasteless berry puree, though whether it was due to out-of-season fruit or being watered down, I can't say. 

Nevertheless, I like the ideas behind this little health food store. The granola on sample was tasty, and there was a decent selection of superfoods for sale. Heck, even the cheesecake would have probably been passible to someone who really likes coconut. The staff are friendly enough (at least, they took it quite well when I pointed out that I was shorted a ten in change), and the facilities clean-cut. Overall, definitely worth the trouble for vegans; decent for the rest of us."}
{"text":"Raw foodists can rejoice! Crudessence is the first living food restaurant in Quebec. It sacrifices nothing to make delicious, innovative, gluten-free meals using completely local and organic (or 'biologique' as it's called in Montréal) ingredients. 

The lasagne, (which uses slices of zucchini, and Brazil nut 'parmesan cheese'), is so good it rivals some of the best traditional pasta-based lasagna I've ever eaten. The tacos are perfect inventions using a combo of corn, sundried tomato and flax for the shell and are heartily filled with sprouts, avocado and red onion. The \"Shepard's Pie\" made with lentils, and the thin, nut-based \"Crepes Sauvages\" are uber-flavorful; each bite is meant to be savored! The mostly-mushroom \"Om Burger\" is decent, but if you're going to a joint like this, why not test the chefs' culinary skills and order a more challenging dish? 

The dessert list is sufficiently long for such a small establishment. From the lime pie to the \"Blueberry Un-Cheesecake\", and chocolate mousse and brownies, each morsel is packed with punch, far more than you'd expect. Think quality over quantity here. 

The specialty juices, smoothies and elixirs are well worth their price; ranging from $5.75 - $8.75. I like the \"Hippocrate\" cucumber and celery juice, and the killer almond-milk \"Chia Chai\". 

Although the proportions are on the scant side, I was surprisingly full after my meal because each dish is packed with so much protein and filling fiber. 

The laidback ambiance in this small, bright establishment is great for a casual date or eating solo, but going in a group is not recommended (reservations not accepted). Staff are friendly, and informative in case you have any questions about raw food or lifestyle. 

Tip: This location is footsteps away from neighboring Jeanne Mance Park - if it's sunny outside, order your food to take-away and enjoy it as picnic fare in the park."}
{"text":"This must be my month of hitting up all the Vegan places! Truthfully speaking, I had zero idea that I was going to end up here tonight, and I came for a smoothie, and ended up trying their raw chocolate and key lime pie.  I could pretend I don't know what happened but I was so intrigued (yet not super hungry) that I had to ignore the stomach saying no more food this one time.

You see, I have never ever tried this whole raw food thing. I was also confused because if it is raw food, I guess it is non heated? This will be left for another day to be discovered, but for now I can tell you:

A) Lassi aux Framboise - made of nut yogurt, raspberries, mango - was seriously surprised at how tasty it was and thick like a lassi should be!

B) Raw Matcha Chocolate - I love matcha I love chocolate, and when you put them together, it's pretty much heaven. I could eat this again and again

C) Key Lime Pie - Macadamia Crust, Lime and Avocado Mousse - I have to say this is pretty experimental for me, but a friend was talking about avocados all day and I had no choice. Surprisingly Limey and whipped avocado did not taste like avocado at all. As I said before, I am a crust-lover and this was good, but I wished for something a lil more than oily nut something drier and could be graham cracker like would have been super. But geez, who am I to complain, I would have never come up with that.

I am super intrigued by the lasagna and the nachos, so I guess the next time I am there....

Oh yeah, this place is also gluten free."}
{"text":"Great food!! The service was wonderful too; my mother and I (who are not easy people to serve) were taken care of in an extremely positive way. Not a huge place but very cozy and a great park nearby for a healthy picnic. It took awhile for the food to be made which made sense because it is high-maintenance stuff, but so delicious. Best vegan meal I've ever had."}
{"text":"Concept très intéressant avec pleins de choix crus, sans noix et sans gluten.
L'est est aromatisé avec de la menthe et cela lui confère un goût sympa et désaltérant :)
Mon pad thai était vraiment sympa, bien assaisonné tout comme le wrap que j'ai pu goûter.
Le gateau au faux mage et aux bleuet n'avait rien à envier au cheesecake classique, une réussite !
Seul bémol pour moi c'est le prix qui est dans la limite haute mais bon les plats sont travaillés et originaux donc on peut passer outre ;)
Expérience à retenter !"}
{"text":"VERY good food, and while I think the price is probably right for the freshness, I was very unimpressed with what they charged for alcohol. 11$ for a glass of wine is a bit much."}
{"text":"What a cute little place. That's all I remember. The food was OK. They don't have coffee. I was there for brunch. Ya."}
{"text":"We go often enough when were in town that the food is indeed yum. I do often get their warm option on the menu for those that can't imagine the food being anything but raw. 

When there is a shift change its a good idea to let the tables know.

When your ready to leave you just go to the counter which is different from traditional restaurants; just an FYI."}
{"text":"We went during lunch time and the place was half full.  We ordered take out and explored the restaurant while waiting.  There was a little window seat and fridge with ready-made food.  We ordered the Pizzazz and the Mr. Pall IV Bowl and tremendously enjoyed both of them!  The food was made fresh with interesting ingredients.  Both the presentation and the taste were fantastic!  It was a tad bit on the pricey side, but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow and wow
Loved the OM burger!!
Lentil soup was amazing!!!!!
Chocolate mousse was fabulous"}
{"text":"It proved I'm not a vegan and can never be one. Got a slice of blueberry uncheesecake but it wasn't tasty at all. The overpowering almond smell, the weird pie base, and most of all, no blueberry taste at all! Also, the green water they gave us, tasted like toothpaste, it's actually water with mint syrup. 
Ehh, I am retuning to my carnivore life!
The service was chaotic as well, we got asked three times what we wanted by three different people."}
{"text":"Why is their vegan food so impossibly savory??? It makes steak feel so one dimensional even for a meat lover.   I ordered the lasagna with the side of salad.  It's a flavor journey into outer taste[sic]!! The mixture of nuts, garlic, basil, eggplants, tomatoes, everything come together like a symphony orchestra of flavors.  Though I'm a bit allergic to some things thrown in there but who cares it tastes so good...that's what Benedryl is for!  I had heard David Côté the CEO of Crudessence talk at an event and he's so passionate about the food that it really translates to the quality of food as seen on my plate!"}
{"text":"I've never tried a raw restaurant before, but have had plenty of vegan cuisine. What an amazing experience this was with such great flavors and ingredients. 

It was a really cold night, and I was more looking towards a nice bowl of hot steaming pho instead of any type of raw restaurant - but just because the food is raw, didn't mean i wasn't completely content no matter the weather outside. 

We started with a cheese plate, all cheeses were great, but a creamier cheese that was cashew based really was the winner. We then proceeded to a black bean noodle dish (me) and a lasagna dish (date). My noodles were warm which was a nice surprise at a raw restaurant. This was mentioned on the menu and made me happy when I got the plate, but the lasagna my date had was even better in flavor and presentation. Both dishes were great. 

We decided to go all out and order two different desserts - a blueberry cheesecake and a lime tart. Both were delicious, but the blueberry cheesecake was both of our favorites. 

Since this was my first time at a raw restaurant - I mistakenly assumed that the food wouldn't be warming and comforting because the products weren't entirely cooked. I couldn't have been more off the mark. The food was great and I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Seriously the best gluten free restaurant in Montreal! I love their Om Burger and the Pizza!!  I come here way too often and i love it!"}
{"text":"Comme c'est BON!!! Je suis accro à ce restaurant! En plus d'avoir des plats très goûteux et toujours excellent, ils sont vraiment de qualité et bon pour la santé. Pour moi qui est très intolérante au lactose et gluten, c'est le paradis ce restaurant...je peux manger tout ce qu'il y a au menu sans problème! Que demander de plus!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a small cafe type restaurant, close to Mount Royal, with raw vegan options and was recommended by a friend. The service we received was unacceptable. We sat, waiting for someone to take our order and after waiting for about 15 minutes and decided to place our order with the cashier. I ordered BLTA with kale slaw, by boyfriend ordered the mushroom tartar (appetizer) and a soba salad. The wait to receive our first items, which ended up being my food only, took over 45 minutes. I had to get up and ask for silverware after waiting a few minutes and noticing,no one coming over to drop them off. At that point I also checked on my boyfriends appetizer, which should have been dropped off first, and was told it was still being prepared. After 10 minutes, it finally came out, taking another 15 minutes before he received his salad. 90% of what's served here is raw, and since the items were simple I don't understand what took sooo long. When the food arrived it was fine, but it didn't make up for the lack of service or attentiveness we received. The servers seemed so nonchalant about it after I expressed to them the wait time, and did nothing to alleviate our frustration. 

They do have grab and go items, so if you're thinking about stopping in for a bite that might be your best option."}
{"text":"J'adore le nouveau menu de Crudessence. 

L'un des meilleurs endroits santé au centre-ville.

Aucun four ici car de la nourriture crue y est servie.

Vive les légumes! Un mélange savoureux de saveurs exquises et fraîches.

Décor épuré mais tendance, sans prétention. Ils ont aussi du vin!

À essayer pour faire le plein de vitamines."}
{"text":"By far the best food I have ever ate! I don't just mean the best raw vegan food I mean the best food over all! Fresh, colorful and simply delicious! The staff is incredibly polite and professional. I come to Montreal from NYC just to have a meal here! Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"We originally planned to go the vegan place that was above this only to discover they had closed.  We decided to try Crudessance rather then La Panthere Verte next door.  I had the pesto lasagna that was absolutely one of the best I have ever tasted.  My daughter had the Fujiyama and loved every bite.  A little heavy on the sprouts, but otherwise perfect.  We shared a brownie and an ice cream sandwich and were beyond full at the end.  The staff was a bit overwhelmed while we were there so service was slow."}
{"text":"After visiting Aux Vivres, I fell in love with vegan food that is prepared by those who know how to make it awesome. I am not vegan, though if I could figure out how to afford/acquiring food like this daily, I probably could do easily. Although I also spend the majority of my life in extremely poor countries where if you tell someone who made you food you are \"vegan\" they will probably spit in your face at your lack of empathy with how hard ANY kind of food is to come across regardless of what or how. ANYHOW, haha..

Came in for lunch, got a ginger kombucha which I love, and we ordered two soups, hot lentil one with coconut, and gazpacho. Both were super yummy, with yummy crackers. Then we both had sandwiches. My wife had the BLT, made with aubergine I believe, which was really yummy, and I have a sandwich called Champion, which had all kinds of yummy greens and garnishes in it.

We really enjoyed it all. Very yummy, and we felt very healthy after. It definitely gets pricey vegan food, but is still very much enjoyable"}
{"text":"The vegan/raw/gluten-free revolution is upon us, and I have been sitting on the sidelines. I'm all for it, but not an active participant. 

Predictably, Crudessence is right next to the university, right next to yet another green everything-free joint (La Panthère verte). The decor is as welcoming as their staff. What their staff isn't is prompt.You'll get served if the place is empty around 11am, but come noon, you should have Candy Crush on your phone. It's a rather frustrating experience since you can see the plates sitting on the counter, not being delivered to their respective tables.. I can only watch the cooks flirting the kale away for so long man! Their menu is very tempting; they have a little brunch menu as well on week-ends, and a lunch special which may or may not show up.

As much as I can rationalize the fact that I'm eating raw food, some things remained a suprise. For exemple, it's only natural that if your food is raw, it should be cold. Unless you're eating soup, it's all cold. Cold pesto lasagna. Which was good, but not earth-shattering; I think it could do without the tomatoes which add a weird texture. I waited about 10 mins for my plate to be prepared, but some 20 more for my desert to arrive, obviously because it had to thaw. My avocado-lime pie was good. And that's it. It's okay. Another raw side-effect is that unless you order tempeh or something with a paste in it, it's not very filling, but ends up being maybe a bit pricey for the amount you get. I can't say I'm convinced, but I'm curious to try more."}
{"text":"Vegetarian here but not vegan. This place was basically everything I dislike about what I think of as \"apologetic vegetarian\" food. Stacking up raw vegetables and calling it \"lasagna\", pretending vegan baked goods don't taste like chalk. 

\"Hey look, we made a meatloaf out of sprouts!\" No. No you didn't. 

Food was okay for being just piles of random-ish raw stuff. It was also overpriced, faddish and astoundingly hot in the restaurant. Didn't get to try the smoothies as their ice maker was broken so we got some complimentary warm water to sip in the warm room and eat our warm piles of expensive raw food. Apparently the chefs are bad enough it costs extra to pay them to not cook the food?

Green Panther next door, however, is superb."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to go to Crudessence after reading positive reviews. I've been vegetarian for several years and although my partner is not, it is not uncommon for us to go to veggie restaurants once in a while. We weren't sure what to expect when we came in, but we definitely did not expect what followed... 

When my fiancé ordered lasagna, the waiter (who was a nice girl) told us they lacked the ingredients to make it. Raising an eyebrow, my partner looked at the menu again and settled for the pizza. 2 minutes later, the (very apologetic) waiter came back to announce they didn't have the ingredients needed for this dish either. We asked what they DID have and it seemed at least a third of the menu was not available. That was a big downer... We settled for two Pad Thai. Well, the surprise we got when we got our plates! I'm not a raw foodist, but I do make it a point to eat raw several times a week and I've looked up several recipes online for future reference. What we got was a glorified salad. It was a good salad, I gotta give them that, but like I said, not at all what we expected. My fiancé was the most disappointed of us for this meal but he made an effort to finish it. 

The one redeeming quality of this meal was the dessert; I heard great things about faux-cheese and I was determined to try their faux-cheesecake. Well, they nailed the dessert that's for sure! It was delicious! 

I would go back for the deserts but not for the main course. I feel I could save a ton of money by preparing my own fancy salads at home. I get the price of organic food is expensive, but I've never paid for pure salad in a restaurant before and I felt that I had been tricked. Perhaps giving a proper name to their pseudo Pad Thai would be a good idea. 

Bottom line: Good raw food but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"This review might be a little shorter then usual since I've only ever eaten her once and it was on the patio. So I can't speak to the interior look and feel but if they pay the same attention to detail on the interior decor and layout as they do to the presentation of their food, i can only think it's done well.

My first experience with Crudessence was this summer and let me tell you it won't be my last! The waiter who served us was great, he answered our many, many questions. He also made suggestion that everyone ordered and loved.

I love vegetarian food and eat it every chance I get, in fact I cook vegetarian when ever I'm at home. I find every time I go to a \"Vegetarian Restaurant\" the food is bland and I always leave feeling hungry. But not at Crudessence, I had the tacos off the lunch menu and I have to say I was surprised at how tasty they were. Now let me say that if you're looking for dishes that mimic exactly their meaty counterparts you'll probably be a little disappointed but if you go with an open mind and give the dishes a chance to stand for themselves you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to give this little , cozy place 5 stars. The food is excellent, fresh colorful, super tasty. Remember this is a vegan restaurant or perhaps more like a Cafe type set-up. 
I love this place. Great and very friendly and helpful service. 
You do not have to be a vegetarian to eat here. The food if you are not a vegetarian will absolutely surprise you. 

Hugs 
Enjoy."}
{"text":"My husband was really skeptical of a raw restaurant, but after he said it was the best place we ate at in Montreal. 

I got the Majestic wrap and it was very tasty and unique. He got some couscous dish and loved it. 

I also thought the green mint water was a great touch. 

Go to this place for a healthy, guilt-free, unique & tasty dining experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, expertly crafted, with wholesome ingredients. If you have specific dietary needs, than this place is for you. I am on a 30 day cleanse (read dull) and these guys brought some much needed excitement to my dinner. Sugar free, raw, gluten free, and non-dairy...but delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and well put together. The pad Thai was phenomenal and everything was super flavorful. You get what you pay for, and this place really brings that out.
From juices to crepes, everything here seems to be well thought out."}
{"text":"Very cool green filter water, smoothie is really beautiful and tasty, various of choices that I can have all kinds of fruits I like in one smoothie!!! Cozy and elegant environment, ac is really strong for this summer!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I am not a vegetarian, let alone a vegan. I was in the area seeing the art museum and chose to come here for lunch because it is a short walk. The cafe is a cute basement level area with living walls and recycled works of art. The service was friendly and helpful. I had the om burger based on recommendations on yelp. I was surprised that it was cold. I thought the flavor was good but it was difficult to eat. The \"bun\" is more of a grain flatbread that didn't stay together completely. My husband had the bowel with black beans and sweet potatoes with fresh spinach- we both agreed that this was excellent. The table water is green and I'm not sure what it is flavored with, but it is delightful. Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"Peu importe vos choix et préférences alimentaires, Crudessence est à essayer. Je suis toujours fasciné par la qualité et l'originalité des plats. Les portions sont toutefois assez petites pour le prix. Essayez la lasagne ou un des bols. Plusieurs produits d'épicerie sont également en vente. La sélection est assez vaste et on peut mettre la main sur plusieurs produits biologiques qui peuvent être difficiles à trouver ailleurs."}
{"text":"Un 5 étoiles pour un restaurant dans son genre! Il faut bien sûr être ouvert à faire des découvertes et laisser de côté nos habitudes! On est d'ailleurs accueillis avec  de l'eau mélangée à de la chlorophylle, donc l'eau devient verdâtre. On goute! J'ai dégusté le genre de Pad thai. Il contient une tonne de légumes, mais surtout une vinaigrette ultra goûteuse (assez épicée à mon goût d'ailleurs, avis aux gens qui ne mangent pas épicé comme moi!). Je suis passée à travers mon bol en 2 temps 3 mouvements! Mon conjoint pour sa part a essayé un burger. On s'entend qu'on est TRÈS loin du burger que l'on connaît, mais ça n'empêche en rien d'être un plat savoureux et satisfaisant. Il a ajouté l'extra \"bacon\" d'aubergine qui, sans se rapprocher du bacon, était assez intéressant au niveau de la texture et du goût. En dessert, il a essayé le gâteau au FAUXMAGE et bleuets. Vraiment réussi. Pour ma part, j'ai essayé la tarte à la lime à base d'avocat. Très réussi aussi. Tout en fraîcheur. Mon conjoint, un carnivore aguerri, a bien aimé son expérience et aimerait la renouveler! Même chose pour moi! On est sortis du restaurant satisfaits, sans pourtant nous sentir gonflés (comme on se sent souvent après les repas au resto!)"}
{"text":"I got the pesto lasagna and I personally loved the kale Cesar even more next time I will get the kale Cesar all for myself ! The staff are the sweetest and the ambiance is adorable casual chic good for every occasional what a nice place!! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place and food. Staff was very attentive for when to pick up our empty plates and bring our next plate. Food was delicious. But is more of raw vegan style instead of fake meat.  Tried the cold crusher toner, that was an experience. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well thought raw food menu and tasty smoothies and dessert. Great services."}
{"text":"Very interesting vegan restaurant. My friend and I shared two bal and a smoothie. The taste is new and fresh. The combination of diverses ingredient is very healthy."}
{"text":"I stopped by Crudessence with a friend today and everything definitely met my expectations. The restaurant is located on Mackay, just south of Sherbrooke. The inside is also very nice and clean, which is always a huge relief.

The food itself was very good, especially considering the majority of menu items are served completely raw. I was a bit skeptical at first because a lot of the dishes include some sort of nuts, which I'm not a big fan of, but everything we ordered ended up being very good. I 100% recommend the sushi appetizer! The service was also extremely friendly and fairly quick. There is also a section at the front of the restaurant where they sell some of their products, as well as other vegan products, which I found pretty neat. 

Overall, I'm happy that I finally got the opportunity to go to this restaurant and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Je l'adore! I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to check out Crudessence, given that its location is so close to where I typically stay in Montréal. This is the perfect lunch spot. This is the perfect healthy dinner spot! It's just perfect for me, because when I travel, although I never stray from my vegan diet, I do stray from my healthy diet and I may give in to my beloved nemesis, fries or chips to satisfy my hunger quickly and conveniently. But never again in Montréal!

I believe just about the entire menu is raw. What this means is, come in and take your time. I was able to watch the chefs work their magic in the partially exposed kitchen and such wizardry doesn't come quickly. Everything is exquisitely and lovingly prepared and plated, edible works of art. Major props to the sweet server who also did some meal prep along with serving the entire restaurant of happy diners. 

The cheese plate... this is how I started my day. Take a look at my photo. I mean, have you ever? I have never had vegan Parmesan taste so much like the real thing. The sharp tangy, slightly sweet, slightly nuttiness of it... and the chewy texture. It's a small amount, but very rich and flavorful. It pairs well with the dried fruit. Similarly, the sharp Cheddar and creamy variety that comes in the ramekin is delicious when combined with raw flatbreads filled with seeds and nuts. This is everything I miss about cheese plates! 

I also enjoyed the smoky eggplant BLT, between more of that rich raw cracker bread, a flavor and texture extravaganza, so nutrient rich, you can practically feel your body thanking you. 

I was left pleasantly satiated, but not grossly full. This is why I fucking adore raw food when it's done well! Finally, I couldn't resist getting one of the heavenly raw dessert bars (chocolate cranberry Dream bar) to take with me to enjoy on the day of travels I had in front of me. How nice to have a healthy, delicious treat on the plane as my fellow passengers had to scarf down the sad offerings of the airline. 

Cannot wait to return to this healthy paradise."}
{"text":"Best place EVER! I recently went totally  vegan, and I am always satisfied with th food and even full after! I looove the tacos I usually get two and It's perfect. Recently they were packed with a convention and gave us kale chips and a free desert each because of the wait! Wow! Amazing service! I highly recommend this place to non-vegans too and vegans! Soooo tasty and goooood!"}
{"text":"creative healthy food, if they were organic i'd go even more often, the lasagna is good but little dry. the smoothies are food but filled with sugar the cashier told me that's why she never drinks them and when i asked to change some stuff in the smoothie they said every change cost 2$!"}
{"text":"Amazing gem right off the park! I might travel back to Montreal just to eat lunch here."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't be listed as $$$, it's not nearly that expensive.  My partner and I went to Crudessence on Mackay we both ordered an entree and a drink and our bill was around $30.  
The food here is excellent.  I had the El Sol pizza, the pizza sauce was made from Chipotle, it was incredibly tasty.  I'm coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if there is a slight chance if you have a nut allergy, we asked the waitress if the ohm burger had nuts in it, she said no but unfortunately she was mistaken and my friend had a severe allergic reaction that required hospitalization in the ER. She is fine but agrees the food looked good but felt eating raw vegan food was too healthy but potentially dangerous. Me and my friend are both nurses and pretty health conscious. I rather eat food that does not have the potential of sending my friend to the ER."}
{"text":"Not normally a vegan or raw food enthusiast (mostly omnivore) but visited Montreal with a vegan friend and we ended up eating at Crudessence three times, we liked it so much. 

They offer great lunch specials and serve beautiful & surprisingly tasty chlorophyll water at the table. My favorite dishes were the vegan cheese plate, the California wrap (almost like a hand roll married a classic sandwich wrap), and the dream square (a dessert bar with dates and nuts)--but really, it's all good. Definitely a great stop for vegans and non-vegans alike."}
{"text":"The best raw food restaurant in Montreal!
Try the öm burger and don't forget the aubergine bacon extra!! The avocado & lime tart is a great desert you should defo try ;)"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Crudessence for a long time. I finally went and I wasn't disappointed. The place looks really cute; decoration is on point and the ambiance is smooth. We had a great service, the staff is very nice and professional. We had the kale chips as a starter. They were really good. I had the vegan wrap (called exceptional I think...the first one in the menu), it was delicious and pretty filling. It came with a salad for 15$. Was worth it. My friend had a bowl with tons of veggies, quinoa and tempeh. She loved her plate and it was huge. We pushed the fun a little bit too far by getting a brownie...it was excellent but we were full!! Overall, we had a great experience and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to enjoy clean eating that tastes great. They even have deserts. The lasagna is wonderful and the croutons that come on it were good enough to buy a bag to take home"}
{"text":"My wife and two friends decided to drive from Washington, DC to Montreal (only 9 hour drive!) for a little summer vacation. We had made no real plans in Montreal except to wander the city and experience the best it had to offer.

On Day 1, we walked up Mount Royal (great view of the city) a little passed lunchtime so we were quite hungry by the time we came down from Mount Royal. Since we were near Little Lisbon, a Portugese place sounded great until we walked by this place. The little shop is very inviting with a small room off to the side with the wall open to experience the summer breeze. We changed our plans and ate here.

We all loved it! I do not usually eat \"living food\" (what the heck does that even mean), but this place was amazing. My wife and friend got the pesto lasagna and loved it (it comes with the best ceasar salad you'll ever eat). I ordered the FujiYumu sandwich with a salad. The salad was so fresh and had the best dressing I've ever had. The sandwich was great too!

My other friend ordered the dessert plate and said it was \"just fine\" (vegan desserts are yet to find their place in the dessert word, but the chai icecream was great!).

Definitely go here! The water is even cool (they put clorafil in it and it turns green)."}
{"text":"Honestly for a vegan place Crudessence does a lot of things right. I came here randomly looking for a bite to eat and I was not disappointed. The waitress was friendly, she recommend the burrito and it was great, I can't tell you what was in it but I left nothing on the plate by the time I was done. Every thing is Bio. The fruits that came with my plate tasted better then the store bought stuff I get. If your in the area vegan or not give it a try. I give this place 4 stars, It costs a lot tho so be ready for an expensive bill other than that it's fine."}
