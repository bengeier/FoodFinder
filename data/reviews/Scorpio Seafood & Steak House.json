{"text":"Located fairly close to Toronto Pearson airport, and quite obviously located in a hotbed of trucking activity, I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive. Even the appearance of the place - sort of tucked away in the corner of an industrial block - was unsettling.  But, the food was surprisingly good.  Started with a pretty decent Caesar salad, and had the cajun swordfish as a main course. It was spicy but not overwhelming, and the fish itself was juicy and tender.  I'd consider this a pleasant surprise - and the tab came to around $40 for one."}
{"text":"New ownership,  don't know if it's a middle Eastern kebab or traditional steak house.  The interior is decorated to an entirely middle eastern theme and the accoutrement is badly dated circa 1982. The main waiters are from the original ownership but under new ownership.  Had the mermaid platter, steak was good as was the lobster.  The sauces were extremely rich and my wife had a rough night sleep as it was not sitting well with us.  The waiters were generous and attentive.  The food was average. Not bad not great.  But the place leaves you feeling confused,  it is struggling with its identity.  Be either or.  Steak or eastern cuisine.  Not both.  I would strongly recommend Zorro on Torbram which is not far and the cuisine is phenomenonal and consistent.  Akin to La Castile and Morton's. This place left me very very indifferent hence the three star rating, closer to 2.5"}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome place!! The decor is very interesting, flash back to nonna's place way back when, lol but you will be hard pressed to find better food anywhere, and I mean anywhere!!!! Scallops were amazing, as an entree or an appetizer.. But let it be known that if u think scallops are not a meal by themselves then you are in for a surprise!! By far the best I have ever had bar none. Then we get into the steaks... Had filet mignon 10oz... Perfectly cooked and fantastic.. You got to try this place the ambience is different and the food is phenomenal! Way to go Scorpio we will be back ... Lol already have multiple times.. P.s the ladies get a nice little surprise too.. Go and you will see.."}
{"text":"I recently came to Scorpio's for a company Christmas dinner. I work in the area, so I know of the place. However, since plates are a bit expensive, I have never thought to visit. I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. It has a very homely feel to it, with dimmed lightning and framed pictures adorning the walls.  The food is pretty good, considering the price you're paying. I got the Surf and Turf Plate, which is a steak and a lobster tail. The staff, who were two elderly gentlemen, were friendly and courteous. I would go here again, but maybe only after a pay day."}
{"text":"It was with some, no lots, of apprehension that I entered Scorpio for the first time.  It's never too good when your neighbor is called \"Truck exhaust place\" and you are the only food place in a fairly industrial area.  One thinks of greasy dives where the chefs don't wash their hands and the kitchen looks like the washroom and a ton of other movie based scenarios that you can probably imagine.  But that's the beauty of Scorpio, its definite unexpectedness!  It really made me think of the old adage, don't judge a book by it's cover...but enough about the cover and let's get to the content.  The place is pretty high end for the area.  Dishes range in the$20 range for appetizers with a decent 2 person meal going for around 120, with drinks and excluding tips.    The food is amazing.  The calamari was...perfect.  I'm not a big fan of calamari that isnt deep fried and almost onion rings like!  But our waiter was quick to tell me the only way to cook calamari is to lightly bread it and pan fry it to perfection...how could I ever eat it any other way!  This calamari is #1 in my books.  The two main dishes my colleagues and I tried were the orange roughly and the Cajun swordfish, two firsts for me.  Let me say that swordfish has the density of a steak...it's all meat and tough too.  I'm sure they cooked it perfectly but there was not to much Cajun about it, just a light sprinkle of spice.  For a first time, I'd say I'd have my swordfish like I have my guiness....one for each sitting and make sure to chew vigorously before swallowing!!!  The orange roughy though....have you ever wondered what a cloud tastes like....well go to scorpios and try a roughly.  This thing was better than butter in my mouth.  Light, fluffy, it's everything I hope for in my toilet paper but in a very tasty fish.  It's my new fish of choice for this summer!     I got carried away but if all the analogies didn't do it for you, this is a 5 star fish.  Tried their caesar cocktail and it was ok....not bad but not great either.  Stella came in a bottle, not on tap but I couldn't see if they had draught beer or not...would have rounded off a great meal if they did.  I have to end off ,mentioning the staff.  Did not see any women or people under 35-40, but the service was great.  I did feel a bit like I was in a 50s era mob hide out, but in a good way.  Everyone was in a suit, and greeted you like a long time friend just come back into town...literally the head waiter or owner (not sure) came and shook our hands and commented to my Colleague that it had been ages since he came there ( it had been 5 years...but really did this guy remember...amazing!!!!!). They were there to refill or assist on anything and it was like having a favorite uncle around making sure you were ok at the kids table.  I definitely want to head back to try some steak and recommend anyone in the area to check this place out!  And for those who walk past a restaurant judging it by it's outside....you are missing some gems!"}
{"text":"Alright. Scorpio was closed last may. Now its under new management of Charm East franchise. They are doing major cleaning up and renovation. When its open it will be fusion between Western and Mediterranean culture. There will be good food. Drinks and Shisha."}
