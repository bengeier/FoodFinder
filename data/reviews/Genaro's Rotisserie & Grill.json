{"text":"Living in a nearby neighborhood, we didn't realize this gem that has been 2 minutes from our house for the last 6 years. OMG. I'm addicted. The pork brochettes were awesome along with the black beans, cilantro rice. And the sauces were soooo good. We also got the chicken fried rice and it was really good. The tres leches was TO DIE FOR. My ultra healthy calorie-conscious extreme runner husband who doesn't eat desserts suggested we get an extra piece to take home. Whoa. Seriously good eats. I will definitely go back and make it my take-out go to place around here."}
{"text":"great rotisserie chicken and an amazing Genaro's Tray for 2, 4 could it off it.  Lot of Peruvian national dishes.  Staff English is poor.  Prices are OK."}
{"text":"New favorite dish here- the Bandeja Genaro! It serves two and is a selection of all the meats they offer (half a chicken, big pieces of grilled steak and pork, 2 different types of sausage) plus two side dishes. At a little over 20 bucks it's a great deal, and we had tons of leftovers. Be sure to try the fried plantains, too!"}
{"text":"Stop here & try it you won't be sorry! Thought this was just another italian place until my sis (very pickey weird foodie Johnson & Wales trained chef) brought me there. Been back 20+ times now and never a complaint. Plantains are out of this world as are the other sides (spicy beans, fried corn, yucca fries) and the charcoal rotisserie chicken is the best in town. Staff is always welcoming & friendly. Go here!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal today! Chicken was wonderful!  Great grilled vegetables with cheese!  Service was excellent also."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to get takeout.  Their food is always delicious.  Best rotisserie chicken.  Even the white meat is tender.  The flavor and the slight smokiness is top notch.  The employees are always genuine and friendly.  There is not a single item I've ever ordered that I would not eat again or recommend to anyone.  I've not ever eaten in because our home is so convenient to this location, I just bring it home for the family to enjoy.  You will enjoy it, too."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and it was delicious! I enjoyed every morsel of my meal and defiantly plan to come back!"}
{"text":"I only eat here for dinner. At lunch time it's to busy. I have the 1/2 chicken with rice and plantains. The chicken is very moist not dried out like some places. The sauces are very good. It's a little small but everybody is friendly. The service is sometimes slow but the food is worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Just had to see what all the fuss was about - Just call me a Fuzzy Wuzzie now - This place is so good.  The chicken was moist and tender, ribeye was little tough even at med rare but the flavor was so good.  Pork you can cut with a fork.  Our waiter never smiled until we started a conversation about the food then he opened up and was a delight.  Wine list not the greatest but the Chilean Malbec went nicely with the seasonings on the meat.  Would definitely go back - extensive menu allows you flexibility and will take a while to try everything.  This is a definite five star for food.  Oh and I think they have worked out the A/C problem as it was very comfortable in the restaurant but did notice several stand along units working."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I don't have time or space to talk about all the fabulous things I could say about Genaro's so I will focus on the best.

The fried plantains are incredible. The plantains are not the perfect shaped frozen ones you get at a restaurant supply store.  They are hand cut and are at just the perfect level of ripeness. Not too overly sweet/ripe and not super green either. 

Roasted chicken is my death-row meal anyways, so when I get slow-roasted succulent chicken and amazing traditional Peruvian sauces to go with them, I am in pure heaven. I wish I could tell you more about the sauces but as my waiter told me -- I would tell you, but then I'd have to kill you...

Last but not least do not leave without a slice of their tres leches cake. My mouth is literally watering as I write this. The \"frosting\" is sort of a marshmallow fluff consistency and the cake is super moist from the sweet milk it is soaked in. 

Service is always friendly and best of all, it's cheap!!  I hate that I have to go to work and might edit this review later, but for now I just need to post simply to get the amazingness out there in the Yelp world!  Go Genaros"}
{"text":"Really good food, Bandeja Genaros was great, chicken pork, streak and Spanish sausage. Sides where cilantro rice. Desserts, churro and Tres Leches."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It really is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. They use charcoal for their grill and you can taste it. Steak with chimichurri is always perfect. Fried yucca, cilantro rice, pork sandwich, and the best tres leches I have had.The deserts are all incredible. If you do not like it you are a mutant. If you would like diabeetus try the Inca Cola."}
{"text":"The location for this restaurant is strange, but that's the only negative thing about Genaro's! The food is unique, genuine and absolutely delicious! The service has always been at least great. But I really can't say enough good things about the food! 
I think a place like this should be somewhere a little classier(in order to capitalize!) but I'm selfishly glad that they are around the corner from me!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant was really sad to see it closed down when I went today.  Anyone know if they got a new location?"}
{"text":"Amazing rotisserie chicken!  If you are looking for something a little different, try this place!!! It is Peruvian food at it's finest! I am not a huge avocado fan but everyone seems to rant and rave about the avacodo dish. The chicken fried rice is also another favorite that everyone in my family frequents. Everyone I have brought here has come back as a regular customer. Oh and did I mention the tres Leche? It is a MUST!"}
{"text":"As soon as we finished eating here, we drove home, I ran into the house, opened up my laptop to write this review.  That's how sublime this meal at Genaro's was! I have a new obsession...the chicken, plantains and tres leches cake.  Read on, fair Yelper.  Read on. 

On the outside, the restaurant didn't look too impressive.  Inside, it was super clean and diner-like, complete with a row of stools and a counter to eat at, and a cake case.  (More on the cake case later.) Oh, and the modern white light fixtures make the space look classy!

Here's what we had: 

Passion Fruit Juice: Made in-house and delicious!  Pure passion fruit, no strange pink color.  Just the juice and what I guess is water and sugar.  

Chicha Morada: Our server was so awesome, and after we sang the praises of the passion fruit, he brought us little samples of this Peruvian drink.  We were told it's fresh made from corn and fruits and cinnamon.  Sounds strange...looks like wine, but tastes like...a fruity, spiced fall drink.  Really refreshing over ice.  My husband ended up ordering the full-sized one. 

Shrimp and Avocado Appetizer: Think of a dreamy creamy shrimp salad, scooped into two avocado halves.  Really refreshing and fresh tasting. Served with a hard boiled egg. 

Peruvian Corn: This corn made me laugh...it looked like a puffed up mutant of a regular ear of corn!  The kernels were ginormous...about the size of a small marble, or Trident White gum. The corn itself is strange in that it doesn't taste like corn...more like a starchy potato.  But it was nice to scoop cheesy sauce over it, and have it as a side.  

Genaro's Salad: What's cool about this salad, is the mix of veggies in this salad.  It's got some spring mix and iceberg lettuce, but then beets and some carrots and avocado and cucumber...I think I saw a green bean too.  It comes with this green, I think cilantro dressing, and comes in a taco shell bowl.  What a flavorful mix. 

Sample Platter (For 2, but could be for 4!): This was HUGE and fantastic.  Forgive me if I forget something, but it included half a rotisserie chicken, 8 ounces of steak, 10 ounces of pork, two different sausages, and two sauces.  The chimmichuri (sp?) is THE BOMB!  I mean fresh, savory flavor explosion!  The chicken is by far the best roast chicken preparation I've ever had.  Juicy and flavorful. My favorite meat.  The pork was very tender too, as was the steak. 

Cilantro Rice: Great side to go with meat!

Plantains: I agree with Victoria S.  The plantains aren't cookie cutter looking, and are fried just right and caramelized.  My husband and friend took down the first order, and got a second plate, they were that yummy. 

The kicker.  THE TRES LECHES CAKE.  Holy cow.  I dream of this cake and want this as my birthday cake.  Every day.  Yes,  everyday shall be my birthday because of this cake.  My friend Keith was taking a spoonful, and I grabbed my spoon and knocked the cake out from under him and ate it!  (Half jokingly!) The cake is moist, and topped with, yes, a marshmallow like topping, and smothered in another milky condensed milk-like liquid.  It's so purely milky, it's like eating a carton of whole, sweetened, fresh milk.  I'm dying.  I'm dying right now.  

The only thing I recommend doing...is ask your server which desserts are made in-house.  Obviously this cake.  However, the chocolate cake, I'm 90% positive looks from Costco.  Our server was great and said the tres leches is the best, so we went with that one.  

Every server we encountered here was kind and helpful and made us Peruvian-food virgins feel comfortable and excited about coming back.  

Next time, I'm picking up a whole chicken to bring home for dinner!"}
{"text":"I lived in Bolivia and Peru for over 2 years and have visited several times as well.  This is place is pretty great.  For authentic and unique dishes from the Andes try the Papas a la Huancaina and the Salchipapas (hot dogs and french fries).  I had the Lomo Saltado as well and it was great and the flavors were dead on.  My wife and I will be going back soon.  Also always nice to wash it down with an Inca Cola or Chicha Morada."}
{"text":"This used to be a regular place for us to get takeout. We were happy to see they now offer delivery... however, the last 3-4 times (each on separate days) we've called to place an order, noone answered the phone (during business hours!). The one time we finally got through and a guy answered, he was rushed and rude. I changed my mind and gave up on this place. The food is great, but the lack of consistency and good service is a huge deterrent. 3-star deduction. Would have been 5 if they valued our patronage."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Peruvian food.  This place has good chicken&sauces, good appetizers and good Mil Hojas dessert. Sides are good, yet portions are small. I wish the iced tea were better (extremely weak) and that the restaurant had a warmer temperature (brrrr), but overall it's a keeper."}
{"text":"Great rotisserie chicken! When you walk in it's the first thing you smell and it's very welcoming. We go there on a regular basis. The prices are good and the service is always very nice, sometime a little slow but I don't mind. Their pork and steak are really good too. Definitely make sure you get the plantains and save room for their churros!"}
{"text":"We dined at Genaro's on Independence (Indian Trail) regularly and were surprised to go to dinner one night to find it closed. We then decided to try Genaro's on Park Rd Ext. While the food tasted the same, the waiter would not honor my husbands request for sausage as a side which had always been done at the other location. The music seemed to be more Moroccan than Hispanic.  The whole thing just didn't have the same feel. While we loved everything about Genaro's Indian Trail, we will probably not go back to this location."}
{"text":"I have eaten at, and reviewed the Genaro's in Indian Trail more than once.  Thanks to a heavily discounted gift certificate (http://www.restaurant.com/microsite.asp?rid=353089&mcn=00056141), I stopped in here for the fist time.

Is fabulouso actually a word?  It does describe the lunch we had today.

The Bandeja Genaro is a sampler plate meant to serve two, for $22.95.  It contains more food than two people should be allowed to eat. (we did not finish it all)  On the plate was a 1/2 rotisserie chicken, beef, pork, and two different types of sausages.  You choose two additional sides.

Fabu-freakin-louso does pretty well sums it up!"}
{"text":"The plantains were beyond excellent - 10 yelp stars! The mango drink was so good especially if you like sweet. I ordered the passion fruit juice. It was delicious and very sweet which is my favorite. I ordered the avocado and chicken salad appetizer for my lunch choice. Its hugs and I could only eat half. Its two full avocados with rotisserie chicken and a cream sauce scooped inside. They're a bit slow so do not expect quick but do expe t good food."}
{"text":"Amazing meat plate!! I heard about the variety and quality of the food here and I was impressed!  The meat plate had chicken, two kinds of sausage, beef and pork and it was fantastic. You get 2 sides to share and we had plantains and yucca--delectable. I think it's the best Peruvian food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic
Javier was a great server trying to explain all the dishes and answering our questions. 
Marinated grilled chicken with cilantro rice and black beans all was very good. 
1/2 Rotisserie chicken was a large meal.
Shared Alfajores and Tres Leches oh my so yummy"}
{"text":"I was waiting eagerly for this location to open because Indian Trail is not in my normal sphere.  Since it opened I've been here a number of times and swore I wrote a review years ago, but apparently it got lost. I've been pleased to see how it went from super slow to ultra-hopping on a Friday night (who's heard of a Peruvian chicken place with a wait??) but feel like it's going downhill, not uphill.  Since it has a bunch of reviews, I won't hash over the same stuff.  

- The chicken has nice flavoring on the outside and is fairly moist, and used to be my favorite until Viva Chicken came into my life that had better seasoning, is moister and has nicer sauce. 
- Decent plantains and black beans but definitely not the bes tin town.
- I enjoyed their organic side salad in the beginning but recently it's been pretty awful.  
- Step out of your comfort zone and order the Papa a la Huancaina. I never would have thought I would have liked boiled eggs and potatoes in a white creamy sauce but it was absolutely delicious! Who knew??
- Lots of cilantro in lots of items. Ugh. Check my middle name- that doesn't jive with me so I have to be very explicit and careful.

The service is fairly friendly but slow, regardless of if they are dead or busy.  I probably will not go back on a weekend evening with how crowded they are but will definitely stop in for a shopping refuel if I am down near Pineville."}
{"text":"I have finally gotten around to giving this place a try. Based on the really good reviews, I figured I would have gotten better.  It was just okay for me. The place was not crowded and my server was average at best. My chicken was moist and seasoned decently, beans were not spicy despite that adjective and the plaintains were very chunky, very little flavor. I am impressed that the fountain drinks are under $2 since a numbers of places have raised the price on some sweet tea to over $2. SMH.Did not try the Tres Leches cake and wished I had. I will not say i will not be back, but it is not on my immediate radar for lunch/dinner. The meat was seasoned better here, yet I prefer Pio Pio's service."}
{"text":"Status Update....
 I wrote that the Lomo Saltado, traditional Peruvian dish, season beef with onions, tomatoes and cilantro, caught my eye on the menu on my last visit and we tried it tonight.  May I say if it were a super hero her name would be Super YUM!  Are you ready for this? It was brothy with french fries tossed in it!  When it was put down in front of me, I was thinking I don't know about these soggy fries.  The soggy fries, onion and tomato made the dish!  This restaurant is so delicious and very inexpensive.  We ordered two meals, a sandwich, two sides, 2 desserts and everyone had an adult beverage and our tab was $60!
Speaking of dessert, I ordered the tres leche, it was kind of crazy because it had marshmallow fluff for the topping, but it was still good."}
{"text":"If you like MEAT, do come here.  2 words - Meat Sweats!!!

And who doesn't like fried plantains, rice, and beans?"}
{"text":"I love Genaros! hands down the best pollo a la brasa in town. The yucas and fries are delicious with teh special sauces they serve. I love their lucuma dessert the most! I cannot find lucuma in Charlotte very easily so it is always great to come to Genaros and have some. The portions are the right size and you will not be left hungry :) The only thing I do not like its the Ceviche here. This (to me) its not the real ceviche- I have told them too. I hope one day they change the chef who makes this ceviche for somebody that does know how to make it.. or get the recipe from Machu Picchu :)"}
{"text":"Went to the Pineville location with my wife, after reading many reviews, and we were not disappointed! The rotisserie chicken was deliciously moist and flavorful, and there was plenty of it! Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the sides were just OK, and the Inca Corn appetizer was decent, as it had a hard texture and was unlike most corn cobs. It came with a nice pepper cream sauce with bold flavors. But it's the chicken that is the star here. I only wish the skin was crispy. Overall, a good place at an affordable price."}
{"text":"I only found this place because of Yelp, and it's the very reason why I am such a fan of Yelpers! The positive reviews here are truly correct. Consider this place a Peruvian grill of sorts. If you like your meat grilled with unique spices and sauces, this is a great night out.

Restaurant itself is pretty unassuming from the outside in a little strip shopping center much like any other store. Walk in and has a very crisp, modern flair with lightning and accessories right out of IKEA. Staff was very pleasant and immediately greeted, seated, and were very good with recommendations. Being my first time here, had to go with the defacto samplers as I am not a local nor too versed in Peruvian cuisine.

Indulged in the Chicha Morada drink which pairs very well with the food. Unique spices of clove and cinnamon paired with corn and pineapple juices make for a really sweet but welcome palate pleaser. Started with the Inca corn which I had never experienced before. Giant puff kernels on the cobb with a cheese sauce so mild it came across almost like an Amish butter cheese. Also sampled the Chicken Aguadito, a chicken and cilantro soup with rice and veggies. Had a really unique spice blend and reminded me of a very subtle Indian lentil stew. Lovely

For the entrees we split the Bendeja Genaro, a grilled meat sampler of rotisserie chicken, grilled pork, rib-eye steak, chorizo and morcilla. The rotisserie chicken and pork were my two favorites, with the rib-eye being a little two chewy. The morcilla (blood sausage) had a wonderful flavor and the chorizo was also quite good. Comes with two different dipping sauces that add a bit of heat and refreshing flavor to the grilled meats. yummy all the way around. Paired with cilantro rice and spicy beans and you have a culinary delight.

Of course no meal would be complete without a dessert treat and the tres leches and chocolate cake were ahhh-mazzz-ing.

Great local find made possible by Yelp. Give them a try and come hungry, because portions are large and very tasty!

Only thing I would change is the actual printed menu background... so many busy graphics its almost impossible to read. bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Great food here with their rotisserie chicken, fried yucca, plantains, cilantro rice, and the amazing sauces to go with it."}
{"text":"Possibly the Best Chinese this side of Union County... Oh it's Peruvian, well then it is possibly the nicest looking Peruvian Restaurant I have seen, so far (it is the only one so far)!  Four stars may be too generous so you do the Math and see what I said:

Staff is Upbeat, Energetic and Full of suggestions and remarks!  Very Entertaining!  One said \"No Pictures\" (You'll see I did not comply with that \"remark\"/ \"suggestion\") I said : I do not speak English (in Chinese) and he answered me back in Chinese, though since I really do not speak Chinese I have no idea what he said!

Fried Plantains Yummy!  5yelp stars

Fried Yucca - I have eaten this in Cuban Restaurants and these were cut like super thick Potato Fries, though better than most Potato Fries!  These were the Best I have tasted 4.75 stars!

Chimmichurri Sauce, mmmmm this is a very good one, not spicy, though much more than most, very flavorful 5 yelp stars

Beef - I have had better Beef Dishes, even better beef dishes HERE at Genaro's 2.5 stars

Pork - this was good, not great, 3.24 stars

\"Red Sausage\" I do not know what it is really called in Chinese, American or Peruvian, it was an Orange color and it was good enough for 3.75 stars!

Is this Blood Sausage??? Dark, almost Black and with Rice inside - 2 yelp stars

Rotisserie Chicken - the skin  had a good flavor!  I'm not a fan of Rotisserie Chicken so I'll stop there!

Dessert Case!  Check it out!  Look before you buy, if you like!  They usually Have Tres Leches and some other Desserts!  Since I have tasted many, though none on this visit, I will not comment further on my lack of appreciation for these options!

My Girlfriend LOVES Mexican (this is still the New NEW one from August 11, 2010) so I thought I would take her to a Chinese place (Next door to Genaro's is a \"Panda Kitchen and Bath\" - Awesome concept!  Since we love Hot tubs, [she thinks I'm cute in a Speedo, maybe Hot, in a Hot Tub] what a great Date, Mexican/Chinese food served in a Hot Tub (I'm guessing) - They are always closed when I'm down here so I always eat at Genaro's"}
{"text":"I like a joint that is consistent with 4 and 5 stars.  I threw them a 4 star.  Good stuff all the way around.  We hit them on 10/12/2014 with 23 hungry Alpha males and some mixed in wives.  The poor server, looking nervous kicked ass, he broke a sweat, but did not break his attitude or consistent smile.  We gave him a work out.  5 star for the poor bastage.

Never heard of the place and if I had to choose between Mexican and Peruvian, I would go Mexican any day of the week.  But I have seen the light, this rotisserie chicken is out of this world.  Kind of spoiled me, I will never look at Harris Teeter rotisserie chicken the same way.........  

My son and I split a Bandeja Genero.  This is a huge platter of half a rotisserie chicken, grilled chicken breast, ribeye and two sausages.  I think they were blood and polish.  The platter came with two sides, as in big friggin' sides.  We had fries (not to Peruvian, but my boy wanted them) and grilled cheesy veggies.  Most everyone got some sort of rotisserie chicken and plantains.  I guess they are famous for their fried plantains, I tried one for the first time, pretty good for fried bananas and sugar.

Comments from the table were, shrimp and avocado were excellent.  The meat is just as good as a Brazilian steak house.  I was very happy with the new flavor experience and will definatly go back to try some of the other dishes.    

Unexpected big score for my dining education."}
{"text":"Food:
Meats were fresh, hot, well seasoned. Fun potato appetizers with spicy sauce.  Good, homemade-ish tres leeches cake.

Service:
helpful, friendly, informative

Decor:
nice lighting and decor, interesting artwork

Come by and eat at this gem of an authentic Peruvian food while it is still in business. This one might not last because of wonderful attention to detail and lack of crowds."}
{"text":"I rate a peruvian restaurant by the Lomo Saltado, Papa a la Huancaina, the Rotisserie Chicken and the Ahi aka hot sauce...all of which past my test with flying colors...inconsistently! My original post gave info explaining otherwise but things can change, trust me.

All that said, take out is your best bet, service is super spotty. They have the oven roasted corn which i love! If you want to try something different don't hesitate...lunch specials for $7.99 is a great time to do so!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  It is one of my favorites.  Everything is good, especially the chicken.  One of my other favorites is the Pork sandwich with black beans on the the side.  Their tres leches is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love these  little ethnic restaurants that are popping up all over this Beautiful Queen City. Genaro's,  is just that, I recently heard about it and I am telling you - if you want to try Peruvian food...go here!!
My daughter and I stopped in..we were starved..greeted by a very nice waiter named Javier. We started with the Papa a la Huancaina, boiled eggs and potatoes in a white creamy sauce- it was absolutely delicious!  We also had the Calamari , very good the Cilantro Aioli was tremendous!. The whole time the waiter was very helpful to our ordering. We had the Sampler plate, Beef, Pork, Chicken - two kinds of Peruvian Sausage. It was great and a very ample portion for two..we still had leftovers! The sauces were very good, and I learned about Purple Corn, which makes a delicious Juice like drink called ChiCha  Wonderful -  would make a great Spritzer!
We were too stuffed to try dessert but Javier said the Tres Leches  Cake was by far the best in the city.
Go and try ...its a nice sampling of Peruvian Food!"}
{"text":"When I'm missing my Peru friends, I come here and enjoy being at any of the wonderful restaurants along the Peruvian coast. Now if I could just order a Pisco Sour, the night would have been perfect."}
{"text":"PROS: Good tasting food; Large portions; lots of variety

CONS: Horrible service; bad location; Viva Chicken is better"}
{"text":"I found Genaro's and I am certainly a fan. I ordered a half chicken, plantains and black beans. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great. They include two different sauces - both spicy and both very flavorful. One is green and one is yellow. The atmosphere is more what I consider a \"lunch spot\" and I plan to visit for lunch, but for dinner it's not exactly \"cozy\". Offering beer and (a pretty acceptable) house wine is a good plus. Definitely give Genaro's a try - it's worth it."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken is really good, mainly because they give you amazing dipping sauces to go with it.  I usually order the whole chicken, which comes with two sides.  And I usually pick the cilantro rice (very fragrant) and plantains (really awesome).

An order will last me two to three meals, and it's about $20.

I do wish the folks working the counter were a little more pleasant, and perhaps happy to see you when you are there.  But they all seem a bit depressed and annoyed for some reason.

Still, I like coming here to get their rotisserie chicken dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent rotisserie chicken, cilantro rice can not be beat. Louis is server extraordinaire. And last however not least, the price can not be beat.
My new favorite local place to eat."}
{"text":"What a fantastic spot for great Peruvian chicken and the assorted sides. My wife and I shared a whole chicken, plantains, grilled veggies, and a large extra side order of yuca fries. The chicken, veggies, and plantains were spot on. The yuca fries, while still tasty, were not cut from fresh yuca and instead were mashed and reconstituted yuca sticks. For that reason alone, I have to knock a star off. The service was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious, and their chicha morada drink was really great and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Because I was in South Charlotte this afternoon (12/28/12), I happened to run across this Peruvian restaurant and I wanted to give it a try. I'm used to eating at Peruvian places further North (in the US) so I know what good rotisserie chicken tastes like. At any rate, I walk into the establishment and someone greeted me. I reviewed the menu above the counter and then sat down to review a physical menu because I planned on dining in. After waiting/realizing that NO ONE was going to take my order, I had to walk up myself to the counter to place my order. While waiting for my food no one attended to me and while eating it was the same .... I ordered the half chicken combo with black beans and white rice. The chicken tasted okay, the white rice tasted old and stale, and the black beans tasted very bland. When I was done no one placed the bill on my table, so I had to walk to the counter to receive and pay for the bill--yet this is supposed to be a sit down establishment. I told the manager, Will, about the crappy customer service and he seemed nonchalant about the matter. I don't want to jump to conclusions but it seems that if customers are not hispanic (or do not appear to be hispanic), they treat those customers poorly. ¡Qué barbaridad! ¡Qué vergüenza! Needless to say, I won't go back and I won't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this place yesterday, I was just craving something different.  Darn, I wanted to like it so much but....................... I got one of their steak dishes which came with chimichurri sauce , white rice, spicey beans, french fries, plaintains and two fried eggs. I told them to skip the eggs and I was to get extra beans.  Well I dont think I barely got one helping of beans and spicey they were not.  The steak was over cooked, and couldn't taste any chimichurri.  The plaintains were the only thing good, they were sweet, soft and fried just right."}
{"text":"Well Genaro's you earned your 4th star again.  

My two most recent trips were much better than the previous one.  Service was spot on except when it got busy and it was a little chaotic.  

You really have to time it right to get in before or after the first lunch surge and before the 2nd surge.  Otherwise, you could wait a while for your order to be taken and/or your food.

But as always, the food is definitely worth it.  The prices are definitely affordable and you get more than your money's worth.  

This is still on my favorite lunch spots list.  

Thanks Genaro's!"}
{"text":"OK Ok... I am overdue to write about this place, We are new to NC and we are exploring new places and restaurants.
 This little Restaurant has caught our attention, the food is the closest I had to my authentic Peruvian food. I am from Huancayo and I was very impressed on how close their Papa a la Huancaina( my fellow Peruvians will know what I'am talking about) the potato dish in the appz list with creamy cheese and aji sauce, delicious!.Lomo Saltado (fried beef tips with potatoes and onions over rice) very tasty. My husband absolutely loves the food. 
There are actually 2 reasons why I wouldn't give them 5 stars and I wish I could, but I have to be fair to my fallow yelpers.
1 They need to add a touch of Peruvian culture, any pictures art work Peru is so rich on authentic hand made products that can make this place feel a little warmer and authentic, come on!! lets be proud of our culture!!
2 Service ,,,Service, come on amigos lets be a little more friendly when serving the table, I know this is a big + for any restaurant,this is the reason mainly why I knocked down 1 star only, the second time around the manager checked with us the and he made sure we were all set, which we appreciated, cause our waiter wanted to be somewhere else but serving tables, he did better than the first time I have to admit, still more courtesy towards your patrons would earn you a better tip. :)
So yes if you are on your way out of the shopping area and Furniture stores  or the Carolina malls .. stop by this little place, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a huge Genaro's fan and I can easily see why : portions are mammoth, meat is nicely grilled with tasty seasoning, and it is reasonably priced. 

We ordered the meal for two ($22) which had a rib eye steak, sausage, 2 large pieces of chicken (1 white/1 dark), pork, and another sausage-like meat (not exactly sure what it was but it contained rice). The plate also came with a choice of sides, we chose cilantro rice and spicy beans. The sides in my opinion were lackluster but the meats were all quite delicious and served with a fresh chimichurri! The quality was reminiscent of something you might get at a Brazilian steakhouse.  My favorites were the chicken and sausage. They were served with a yellow sauce and green sauce, both of which were great but the green had a serious kick to it.  I also tried some passion fruit juice which would be killer in a cocktail but for me personally it was a little too sweet. (coming from someone who waters down lemonade...) 

All in all I will definitely go back to Genaro's to try the Tres Leches and different sides... I will definitely be getting the chicken again.  If you're a meat-lover and are hungry (and I mean seriously hungry), check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing! Had the rotisserie chicken, grilled veggies and salad! Finger looking good! The only reason they're getting 4 stars is because they're CLOSED now! Had it on Thursday and less than 12 hours later, couldn't get a hold of anyone and the place was empty. So sad because it was good. Wish they would've said something about them closing. Hoping they're just undergoing reconstruction or just moving to a different location. But their number is out of service so it doesn't appear that that's it."}
{"text":"Great chicken made using lump coal! A must try if you're in the area... the best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I'm thinking I should spend more time in Pineville...especially if there are more great discoveries like Genaro's!

When you walk in yo the bright, clean space you can either seat yourself or head to the counter and order for take out. Hubs and I grabbed a seat and oogled at the tasty looking plates that came out of the kitchen. Our server was smiley and swift and before we knew it, our food flew out of the kitchen. Here's what I sampled:

Calamari: 2.5/5: I can tell the calamari is likely made in house, but the breading was too heavy for my liking and the sauce that accompanied the dish had little flavor. The portion is certainly generous, though. 

Rotisserie chicken: 4/5: Super juicy and flavorful. The way a rotisserie chicken should be! The two sauces that come with the chicken (green and yellow) are equally as tasty. 

Cilantro rice: 3/5: This was a fine side item, but I found myself spreading a bit of the green sauce on the rice to kick up the flavor. 

Plantains: 5/5: Perfectly fried, fresh and delightful. Huge hunks of lovely, slightly crispy plantains. 

Overall value: 4/5: For $6.50 ish you can get 1/4 white chicken plus two sides. That's a hell of a deal, especially when the chicken is this delicious and juicy. 

Genaro's is definitely worth a try...next time I need to save room for the tres leches cake!"}
{"text":"The roasted chicken is pretty good but not much else is.  I guess thats why there were only about 4 people there at 12:15."}
{"text":"Probably the best peruvian restaurant in charlotte.  I been to must of them, i like this one the must The causa chicken was superb! And the lomo saltado delish!  I def recommend this place."}
{"text":"We visited this location for the first time tonight, largely because of the write up in the Charlotte Observer today.  (We have been to the one in Stallings often.)  We also had a restaurant.com coupon:  I paid $2 for the coupon for $25 off of a $45 food purchase.  When we arrived (6:30 on a Friday night), there were plenty of tables to choose from, but the air temperature outside was 99 and I think about the same inside!  They had fans blowing, but the tables by the long windowed side were very warm, so we moved to the bar, which was a tad better, but still HOT.  The waitress had beads of sweat on her little forehead all the time, and the cooks had to be dying.  So - hope they get that a/c fixed quick, because we saw several parties either enter & turn around to leave immediately, or leave after just  a few minutes at table.
   But - if the air temp. had been better, this would have been a thoroughly positive dining experience, since the food was rotisserie-perfect as always.  As usual, we ordered the big sampler for 2 (5 kinds of meat, which would easily feed 3 or even 4 with a few extra sides, for $23).  Our table also had the pork entree, and one had the grilled seafood, which was lots of good, varied kinds of fish and shellfish, though maybe needs some more sauce.  That eater was a 20-something big eater, and said it was plenty for sure.  All told, we paid $50 tax & gratuity inc.,  for 3 beers and 3 huge meals (one of them meant for 2 people), and probably took home as much meat as we ate there.  ($75 without the restaurant.com coupon).  
   Bottom line, if you have big meat-eaters to feed, GO, and order a variety of sides to share around.  Fried plantains are fresh & good, order of fries is huge, beans are great, everything else just plain plentiful.  Real wood chips poured into the rotisserie/smoker while we watched, so they're doing it right.  Not a place for a romantic date at all, but great for friends & family & food food food."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken is the best I've tasted. Yes, during peak times the service can be a bit slow and the place a bit chaotic, but you know what? When they lay that plate of aromatic awesomeness in front of you, it is all worth it. And then it  gets even better when they bring the bill. SO worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there again.  Food was great and tres leches dessert was super good.

Had the 1/2 chicken with cilantro rice and fried plantain.  Companion ordered the lunch special which was chicken saltado over pasta.  We enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"OMG.... The chicken flavor is amazing... Wooooo that so grate..... 
Marinated grilled chicken with cilantro rice and black beans all was very good....
the Yuca Frita and Mil Hojas..... excellent....

Thanks Genaros"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered a rotisserie chicken sandwich and an Inca Kola...  

The Kola was fantastic... It's billed as a golden cola and that's exactly what it tasted like... It wasn't syrupy sweet, but it would still make you pucker a little... Not in a bad way, though... Just in a \"you-should-probably-only-have-one\" kind of way...

The fries were basic... They definitely weren't greasy, though, so that was a plus...

The sandwich was a bit of an issue for me... This was my first time here and I don't know if I'm missing something, but I almost choked twice on these random pieces of chicken situation... And I say situation because I don't know what it was... It wasn't hard enough to be bone, so maybe they were pieces of cartilage? Tendon?  It was white and kind of curvy... I'm assuming since they rotisserie a whole chicken, they probably just pull it apart, but since I was eating a sandwich, I wasn't really expecting any roughage... I pulled the sandwich apart and tried to salvage it, but it was too much work... The chicken itself tasted great, but I definitely won't order a sandwich from here again... 

The guy next to me had something called jalea which looked delicious, so I'll probably get that... He didn't choke once, so it's probably safe..."}
{"text":"The chicken here is to die for. I recommend lunch time cause the dinner service gets busy and can take a second for your food but its worth the wait. Grab the platter for 2 a little bit of everything and enough for lunch the next day. Cilantro rice was ok here but at the other chains its mouth watering. I will be here a lot in the future."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to come here ASAP.  I can't believe I've never had this place until now, I've definitely been missing out on some delicious food in my life.

The parking is convenient, and when you first walk into the restaurant, it seemed like I wasn't sure what to expect.  Let me tell you, expect greatness for sure.  Also, the music they have playing is pretty good, even though I had no idea what it was saying.

Have you ever tried Stuffed Chicken Avocado?  Well, you should.  You won't regret it.  The chicken was creamy and delicious with the avocado.  If you're dining in with friends, I would suggest to order the meat platter.  I'm not quite sure of the exact name, but my friends just referred to it as the meat platter.  We received a variety of different meats, and it is a very big/good amount.  I was definitely stuffed.  Make sure to save room for dessert!  Tres Leches!  Order it.  You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Much like the reviewer before me, I ran back to the office, got to my laptop and am now writing this review.  While it took me some time to get here it was well worth the 10 minute drive from my office to eat at this place. Chicken was succulent, the chimmichurri toppings that adorned our platter of meat was PHENOM! both sausages were outstanding, the standard chorizo was great but there was another one which was darker/brownish and it was melt in your mouth sausage goodness. the cilantro rice was to die for and the salad and accompanying dressing were top notch. this is definitely becoming a go to for me!"}
{"text":"Be advised this review is for the Park Rd. location near Ballantyne.  Have been coming here for several years and watched this establishment get worse and worse in terms of horrible customer service and questionable food quality.  Initially this was a stalwart in our family's food repertoire, but after today's experience and multiple second chances for redemption our shadows will no longer darken their doors.

Called ahead for a to go order for 2 whole chickens plus sides for pick-up at 5:40.  The waiter who took the phone order; says \"no problem\".  I arrive at the restaurant with healthy appetite and skepticism (heard this before).  Arriving a few minutes (5:30) early..I am told  the order will be ready in a about 10 minutes.  Okay great.  It's going to be on time.  I re-enter the restaurant at 5:45 and the cashier says the order is not ready and it will be an additional 25 minutes as I am seeing multiple orders leave the kitchen for people who arrived after me (less than minutes to wait).  At this point I cancelled my order.  After exiting a waiter approached me and apologized for the mix-up.  Stating the kitchen staff has issues.  The rest of the staff acted indifferent.  Well I also acted indifferent and went to Chipolte.   My burrito was excellent and they seemed glad to see me."}
{"text":"Would give this place 3.5 stars overall today, food was good. The yucca fries and the spicy beans had to be my favorite. My chicken was cooked perfect but it needed some more flavor or seasoning. Was expecting a little more than just average roistiserie chicken. The sauces they provided helped out as did the chimicurri for an extra .25 to make my chicken taste a little better. If I lived closer I might venture here to try something else."}
{"text":"Love genaros, great chicken and the best cilantro sauce. Faves are the cilantro chicken soup and Saltado."}
{"text":"Let's start with service, good all 3 time we've dined. Every thing we have tried has been above average, the Peruvian dishes where the best, plantains oh my, green chicken soup I could eat every week and more. Leave room for dessert if I could spell it I would, it was most enjoyable, let your eyes be your guide. Nice place, will dine here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good sweet tea
Horrible everything else
Genaro's was generic!
Don't get me started on the horrible server"}
