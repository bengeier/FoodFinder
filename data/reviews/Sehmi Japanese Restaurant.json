{"text":"This place has 93% on urbanspoon! That's actually what bought me here. In hindsight, I really don't know why the rating is so high!
We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon, dynamite roll and Alaska roll. 
The first time around, the rolls were quite bad and kept on falling apart. I told the sever, and she kindly replaced them. 
The second time around, they were much better, but definitely not worth 93%. 
Its worth a try if you're in the area, but I most likely would not come back."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant that does both traditional Japanese and Korean food. I never have dined in at this location, I usually call ahead and pick up. The fish tastes fresh, which is one of the reasons I go here versus another all you can eat sushi place nearby. Food is good but the main reason I give this restaurant 5 stars is the service is stellar. They lady is very welcoming, offering me a seat and free green tea if there is a short wait. She even offers to help you take your order to the car if it is a large order. From a takeout perspective this is good place to get sushi, I will have to do another review when I eat in."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fantastic food! The Dundas St roll is a must and a favorite of mine. I always order one to go after a dine in. The Chirashi dish has pieces of sashimi (of choice)with vegetables and you mix rice and special hot sauce into it. Another must eat, it's healthy as well! So tasty yumm! The double dragon roll and black dragon roll are also amazing."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for sushi this past Sunday.  I've been on a hamachi obsession lately. I found this restaurant from another review site where reviewers gave it such high marks.

This place had negi toro and negi hamachi makis so I ordered them. Generally, most places can't really go wrong with this unless the fish quality is terrible.

When I was given the rolls, the rolls looked like it vomited in itself.  The fish was chopped up with the onion and had a very gelatinous and bubbly quality to them, spilling from the center of each piece.  It really looked like a clear phlegm with fish bits and green onion.

I ate 3 pieces but gave up.  I couldn't stomach eating it.  The rice quality was terrible to boot."}
{"text":"The food is not that great and the price for the kalbi dinner is really expensive. 6 pieces of kalbi for $16.99. The service is great though!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service and friendly staff. Amazing sushi for a good price 

Just wish they delivered"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Mississauga. The Dundas roll is amazing. The service is great and the staff are awesome. Our go to place for great food."}
{"text":"Wow, Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food as I did not expect much from the rather dated store front, interior, and menu items. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi.  Serving sizes aren't huge but sushi is pretty good.  Service is good but slow when busy which is understandable for a mom and pop shop"}
{"text":"Service is friendly but slow. I heard they have changed management and the food was pretty disappointing.  The skimpiest sushi portions and presentation was not appealing. It's a shame as they were one of my regular go to places."}
{"text":"Sehmi is a hidden gem for all the Japanese food lovers out there in Mississauga. It is definitely one of the best. 

My friends and I got tired of Sushi Tei's pricey and mediocre food, so we decided to try Sehmi since it has a 93% rating on Urbanspoon. We were skeptical at first because barely anyone commented about this place on Yelp, but then I completely fell in love after my visit. 

We ordered the Beef Tataki, Beef Yaki Udon, and Sehmi Boat, which included Edamame, Gyoza, 24p of Sashimi, 8p of sushi, 6p of Double Dragon Roll & Tempera. We were amazed by the freshness and seasoning of the sashimi and sushi, very flavourful. The Tempuras were also cooked to perfection. I am not a big fan of Tempura because most of them were usually soggy and bland with a taste of flour. Sehmi's Tempuras were right on spot with a great balance of flavour and flour, very crispy.  I also recommend the Beef Taki Udon. I was very full, but I still managed to finish two bowls of it. They were all very delicious except for the Gyoza. 

When it comes to sushi and sashimi, my friends and I always go for the best. I think Sehmi is just as good as Japango in Downtown Toronto. I have found myself a to-go place whenever I can't make it to Japango, but have a crave for sushi."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a few colleagues on Tuesday. 

Ordered the lunch special which comes with soup, salad and two rolls - spicy salmon and black dragon roll of 8 pieces each. The rolls are small and loosely rolled which caused the filling to fall all over the place. Quality of the fish isn't great either and our party of 4 all agreed that we would not return. But I did like the salad dressing!

Owners are nice and attentive but would not come back."}
{"text":"Nice and easy! Food of great quality! Ordered a Deluxe Tempura and a Small Sushi Tray with 38 pieces. All food was fresh, smooth and tasty.
Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi in a nice clean place. I came here to pick up some take out at an off-hour (around 4pm), so I wasn't surprised to find this place empty. The staff were nice and offered me some tea while I waited, and let me use the washroom while they kept an eye on my little one. The sushi I ordered was fresh and yummy! It's located in a pretty convenient spot at Winston Churchill and Dundas so I plan to stop by more often to try out the rest of their menu. What I DID eat (a spicy crab roll and an alaska roll) were both great. The wasabi was nothing to write home about, but the rice to filling ratio was nice and I couldn't find a fault in them. 

Will I come back? For sure! But I'm totally up for hearing about a few more sushi joints in the sauga area! If you know of any (other than this one and sushi tei), let me know!"}
{"text":"Very fresh. Great service. Quiet atmosphere. Beef Udon noodles are the best we've ever had. Green dragon roll is yummy. Pork Katsu Bento box was so big and delicious. Overall great sushi/Japanese in Mississauga (off the beaten path)."}
{"text":"the food is average. it's definitely \"best sushi this side of the pacific\", hell, it's not even the best sushi this side of the credit river. i get that 99% of places use fake wasabi which i'm okay with, but this place, the stuff that they gave us was a bit closer to the consistency of a wasabi mayo

prices is average, but their lunch specials and bento boxes are a couple bucks more than other sushi restaurants in the area.

the service at lunch was pretty slow. the woman was trying to do a lot at once, perhaps have an extra set of hands help at the front of house. she was very nice and friendly tho.

i went because of the high yelp rating but i think yelp have failed me this time."}
{"text":"I see no reason to not give this restaurant a 5 star rating.  The prices are reasonable, most importantly of all the quality is excellent.  If you are like me who's sick of mass produced sushi at buffets, you will love this restaurant.

As others have mentioned, the sushi master is right there, front and centre.  Greets you with an enthusiastic hello when you walk in. 

I've been here 4 times now. Loved the 2 person combos, it's so delicious and filling, I'd rather pay for this than a $30 buffet. 

I also see they have lots of regulars that come in and are their friends. I can see why.

For Friday dinners, be sure to reserve.  Or you'll end up ordering take out like I did. But it was the best looking and tasting home Japanese meal ever!"}
{"text":"dropped stars for poor service, I understand they must be busy operating with so few people, but it's so rude and inconsiderate to have your guest waiting by the door for a good 20 min, then randomly seated for another 20 min without a greeting, water, or menus to look at. 

Yes, I was completely ignored for 40 minutes!!!!! I tried to catch the waitress' attention a couple of times, but was brushed off. Was it because I was alone? Thirsty, hungry and extremely unhappy for wasted almost an hour there, I left the restaurant. Even then I don't think anyone noticed. 

Hire more people if you can't handle the busy hours. It's just not right to treat customers this way."}
{"text":"So before I became a Yelper I came by here a couple times with my bestie. There were always seats for us and the food was quite tasty! For some reason, I haven't been back in almost three years. Yikes! 

I'll warn frequent sushi eaters, this place is a bit steep in price but they do mix in a couple good deals here and there with their Sushi boxes. Their lunch specials are also quite impressive (price-wise). 

Three years later, I'm still impressed! I visited last night with my grandma around 6:30 and we were seated just as a couple was leaving. We were given water and tea right away. 

The lady serving us brought a high chair which had all its straps and was very clean (extra points from a high-maintenance mama lol). Even when baby was walking around, the chef and owner were completely chill about it and even gave him a little tour of the restaurant while my grandma and I ate. So cute! 

The food came one after the other. I order Sushi Box A and my grandma ordered the vegetable udon. I liked the sashimi to rice ratio. People always think that more rice is better but it's actually not. The size of the sashimi was good (I have seen bigger) but with the rice, soup and salad it was the perfect combination. 

My grandma's udon soup was also very flavourful and the noodles were so delicious! 

All together, our meal came to about $30 with tip. Not bad for 2.5 people! Lol 

An EXTRA added bonus was that they brought a small bowl of rice on the house for my baby. How nice! 

I'll definitely be returning with my husband next time."}
{"text":"One of the freshest and melt-in-your-mouth sushi in town. We ordered the maki combo (I believe it was spicy salmon, dynamite and salmon rolls) and the tempura appetizer (the asparagus tempura was gold). Great ambience and really nice people, definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"We have been regularly going to this sushi place for almost a year now. This was easily one of the best sushi places in the neighbourhood but has recently lost its touch. Its service has gone down. There is only one person serving. Even though she is courteous, it is difficult to manage 10 tables with 1 server. Last two times we had to wait for 25 minutes just for our appetizers. The rolls are also no longer impressive. We always order the Green Dragon roll and it saddens me to see that they have made their rolls so thin that they fall apart as soon as you pick them up.

The place still has potential but the slow service and less amount of food leaves us disappointed."}
{"text":"I've tried many different sushi places in Mississauga, but this one is by far the best. Very similar to sushi tei, just Les busy. Service is always great. No one makes tofu like they do. Ingredients are always fresh. This Family owned restaurant is quaint and affordable."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Hidden gem! Really impressed and definitely the best sushi in clarkson/Erin mills area! Reasonably priced, good portions and always fresh tasting! Really love the service and seems like a family run business. Love the tempura and don buri as well! So happy we found this place!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going here for awhile and do enjoy their food. Fresh sashimi and some great cooked dishes."}
{"text":"I'm tired of all you can eat sushi restaurants costing $30 each...this is by far the best bento box I've had....big portions, quality meat and sushi.  The crispy lobster roll was fantastic as was their dynamite roll"}
{"text":"Great service and food!   Was greeted by everyone when we walked in and one waitress was able to manage the whole restaurant.   We ordered the Crunch Cali and OMG the best darn thing we ever had sushi wise.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great. The food was good you get what you pay for. I have no complaints. I will not hesitate to visit again if I was in the area. If your looking for a good place to have lunch then this is definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"Sehmi is one of the last great non-AYCE Japanese restaurants in Mississauga and I believe they are doing well. You can tell by the odd hours they are open. I would recommend calling or checking out their website for hours they are open. 

They have the usual assortment of sushi and cooked meals as well as some Korean dishes. The preparation and presentation are excellent. The interior is a little dated but the large booths are still wonderful for an intimate dinner. 

The service is prompt and understated all at the same time. The waitress who I believe is the sushi chef's wife is kind however her English is not great, but who cares. She is patient with your requests to repeat what she said. 

They have a good assortment of combo dishes, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat sushi, the food here is great for this cozy restaurant. Love coming here for the lunch special which is every week day from 11-3. Which includes miso soup, salad and 2 rolls of sushi or a lunch plate for about $10 per person. 

MY fave sushi rolls to get here would have to be the mark's roll which comes w/ shrimp tempura, cream cheese, and avocado. It tastes very fresh and tasty. Also the chicken Teriyaki  is very good which comes with a bowl of white rice. They also sell bento boxes too if you want a combination of diff food. The prices are affordable as well. Try this place out for some good sushi!"}
{"text":"This was excellent. Prepared Sushi salmon tuna shrimp and dynamite sushi were excellent. Miso soup and salad. As well the service and friendly atmosphere was great. Could have used more ginger. Great. I'll definitely return to try Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Update:  I actually think they left out a roll for Small Party Tray that we ordered.  I noticed this as I was uploading my pics and going through the menu to figure out what was ordered.  Tray was supposed to come with a California Roll.  :( Minus another *

Definitely NOT a 5* place!  I've been here once before, but didn't rush back because I felt as though the rolls were falling apart and there was something else, but I can't remember now.

Tonight, I came back with my family because my sister chose it.  Apparently she comes here on a somewhat regular basis.

My experience this time?  Food was ok.  My nigiri still fell apart when I used my chopsticks to pick it up - the rice crumbled onto my sweater/jeans - so I just ate the rest of my sushi the traditional way...with my hands!

MINUS *S
Food was served at all different times to our table.  And I'm not talking about salad first, then sides.  Although our table's order was taken at the same time, a couple people got served one dish, then 10-15mins pass, then a couple of other people, then 10-15mins and one person was served, & I was DEAD LAST.  It took at least 30-45mins to get my sushi combo.

If there isn't THAT much time in between different plates, that might be ok, but there was a significant time elapse in between each serving.  

When my food finally arrived, the server was very nice and apologetic.

PRICES
Just a quick glance at the menu, prices seem good.  However, the portions/cuts of fish is on the smaller side, so keep that in mind.

Food isn't terrible, nigiri/rolls may fall apart, but restaurant would be much better if food arrived altogether when dining in a group.  :)"}
{"text":"Location/Service:
We were craving some sushi/sashimi one Saturday evening and decided to check out this place since we have never been here before. It is situated in a relatively small plaza at Dundas/Winston Churchill, next to a Chinese restaurant - Summit Garden. This restaurant has been here for a long time now, but I have heard that they have changed owners several times. I have also checked the reviews here in Yelp prior to going and it seemed promising. Since we only wanted to get take out, we ordered at the front and paid in advance. It took about 30 minutes to get our medium sashimi party tray order ready so we left the restaurant and waited outside since it was quite small for us to wait around. When we got there at dinner time on a Saturday evening  at ~6pm, there were only 2 tables of 4 there. I found this strange because this is prime time for restaurants so I was a little hesitant to order but we did because still wanted to try the sashimi there and we need to satisfy our cravings. 

Food:
The sashimi party tray was okay. Nothing too spectacular. Actually, for the price and the quality, it was expensive. I have tasted better at other sushi restaurants in Mississauga. I don't think I'll come back again in the future. Once is enough."}
{"text":"The sushi is tasty and fresh. Service is welcoming and attentive. Only downfall is the overprice menu imo, which is probably in place to make up for the lack of customers. Worth it if you don't mind paying slightly inflated prices."}
{"text":"This place instantly became my favourite sushi spot in Mississauga for many reasons.

First off, its a few minutes from my house.
Second, once you walk in you are greeted by the chefs and waitress immediately.
Third, 4.95 for dynamite roll? YES PLEASE. Need I say more the prices here are the best youll find in Mississauga.
They have greaaaaaat lunch specials. A bento with all the usual fixins such as tempura, miso soup, etc. For 10.95.
Last, the quality is AMAZING. I loved the sushi although it was fast to fall apart and it was thin the quality is too.die for and makes up for it. My bf had the sashimi, he said it was fresh!
Try this place you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many sushi restaurants in the GTA and Sehmi has one of the finest Japanese preparation chefs! Their sushi is always made with fresh ingredients and prepared in large sizes.They have generous and hospitable servers too. Sometimes they even treat you to free Miso soup and salad. Sushi here is definitely a 10/10!

This is by far the best sushi restaurant in all of Mississauga, prob GTA! It has fresh ingredients, wonderful service and a very cool, calm and  relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I always come in for the chicken Udon noodle soup. It's consistently been full of flavour, with the noddles cooked to perfection every time. Since I come in during my lunch, it's always prepared in time as well with great service. Would recommend others to come in and try it."}
{"text":"Best sashimi/sushi in the GTA. Owner/chef is meticulously fussy about fresh fish. Blue Ocean rolls (wrapped in cucumber instead of rice) are outstanding. Prices are very fair. Nothing but good things to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have recently started to order from this premise. I find that the pieces (party tray) are getting pretty thin, but this depends on what you are ordering. The california and cucumber rolls are sliced at a normal size, but the dynamite roll is cut very thin for my liking. I have also noticed that certain trays are missing what the menu indicates it has (if I am spending $45-50) I need to get what I ordered, not substitutions. Consistency is very good!"}
{"text":"I visit this sushi place regularly with my girlfriend and it is easily our favourite. The servers are excellent, the meals are warm and fresh every time, and the atmosphere is very soothing. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh but I would skip the pork bone soup. Maybe it was their off day but my bowl of soup came half full like they ran out of broth and although the meat was tender, the whole thing was lacking flavours. We had the spider roll which was good and the Korean chirashi and I ordered take out, also good. Would return again if I am in the neighbourhood for fish only."}
{"text":"Spicy salmon roll was on point!  Only $5!  If you're broke from spending all your money on Sephora and looking for a cheaper sushi joint (but still decent), reach here.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to damn-near every sushi joint in Mississauga, and I think Sehmi is my favourite. I actually had no clue it was called Sehmi sushi until a minute ago, always just called it 'that place on Winston Churchill' when begging my girlfriend to go. 

The fish here is awesome, it's CHEAP, and the service is grea (seemingly flying in the face of all natural rules of eateries). From time to time the chef even sends over new things for us to try on the house. Sehmi has a small, quiet, homey feel to it- good for avoiding humans in flock. I think the fact that it has the corner lot in a little plaza has deterred others from going; I guess that's what makes it a gem."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice and quaint! The staff were friendly and attentive. We ordered the fried oyster and maki combo B. The sushi was above average, but in my opinion, nothing special. I found the prices to be quite reasonable for what we ordered!"}
