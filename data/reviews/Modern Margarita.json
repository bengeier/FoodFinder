{"text":"Hard to review anything other than their \"reservations\" on Open Table. After reserving a table for 4 we arrived at our scheduled time only to be told by the hostess, \"we don't do reservations, that's really more of an illusion of a reservation. It's kind of like call ahead.\"  We waited 40 minutes and then left. Unprofessional and really poor management."}
{"text":"Best margaritas around...the staff are great.....can't wait to come back...
If you like margaritas and excellent service you have to check this place out.... I hope I see one in Minnesota soon.   Hehe"}
{"text":"Decent food but terrible service.  If they continue this way they'll be closed within the year.

Tacos were good and priced well.

Drinks were over priced and just average margaritas with fancy names."}
{"text":"Great setting and good service, but the drinks were very weak and the food portions appetizer sized and not particularly flavorful. Much room for improvement. Also - serving tap water in Phoenix is in extremely poor taste, pun intended. It's not drinkable, so just don't."}
{"text":"We tried happy hour on a Thursday evening.  The place looks really cool and I had high hopes.  We ordered the 3 salsa flight and chips, those were really good.  It went downhill from there.  The chicken wings were cold on the inside and had to send those back.  We never did get plates that we asked for.  We were told the dishwasher was behind.  The manager took the wings off our bill but charged us for what we ordered instead, which we waited a long time for.  It seems they have kinks to work out."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! What a great place to have good modern Mexican food and drinks. The staff is so friendly and great, especially the manager Brian. I come back here every chance I get and its amazing every time!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. Great margaritas and gluten free friendly selections. Love the outside patio area. My only complaint is why only 1 complimentary chip and salsa per table? This is odd for a Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Can only review the fact that we tried to have lunch here last Sunday at 12:45 pm and they were closed until 1:30 pm for a staff meeting. Typically staff meetings are held before opening or after closing. Don't delay opening to hold a staff meeting - especially in the middle of the day on a weekend. Poor management!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, lots of comments on the volume if the music but I thought it was fine.  We ordered the guacamole chips, mahi tacos, and carne asada, all of which were excellent.  Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit here! The food was delicious and the margaritas were very well made. Katie was a fantastic server and gave us exceptional service. We will be back"}
{"text":"Our Friday Margarita Herd enjoyed the food here more than the drink. Steak fries, steak skewers, wings, guacamole, chips and salsa, all good. We inadvertently ordered the first round of margaritas outside of happy hour - at $18 each. How is that even possible in a boarded up development?

Next week, Jalapenos at DC Ranch."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!"}
{"text":"We went there for a friend's Birthday arriving early to not make her wait. 90 minutes later they called me and said a spot was ready which was two barstools at the bar. There were 6 adults and 3 kids... highly disappointed in the host staff. They were rude and didn't understand why we needed a regular table. We left and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Loud, noisy and terrible food. Do not recommend. Water terrible. Got very ill from this restaurant"}
{"text":"Happy Hour all day Sundays!! Yes please! The salsa and guac are super good and the pork tacos are lovely!"}
{"text":"We went in excited for a night out and something different in downtown, big mistake on our end.. It was busy and new so we expected flaws. Hopefully it's a more epic fail than the previous place!!! Older bartender with the tattoo sleeve... Rude and didn't care about bar guests. One of the off-duty managers stood at the outside bar and was vulgar all night and talking poorly of staff. We moved inside just to get away from him. The one female bartender seemed to be running circles around the other staff, if we could give her 5 stars and not the place, we would. Wouldn't recommend it, really to anyone. We expected kinks in service because
it's new, not kinks in personality and kindness. You can fix continuity, you can't fix assholes and attitude. Won't be back or recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! The atmosphere was great except that we had to pretty much yell at each other during dinner because it was so loud inside. We also felt very hurried by our waitress. We enjoyed the food but will probably find a calmer more relaxed environment next time!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Very clean. Food excellent, made from scratch, margarita superb. Good wine selection. Our hostess Katie is welcoming and a sweetheart.Carlos our waiter/bartender, very knowledgeable. So glad we chose to eat here."}
{"text":"Super slow service for lunch, patio lame, looking at concrete and traffic,  much nicer patios in the area, carne asada tacos were good, Katie the bartender was excellent. Overall, an average experience."}
{"text":"Very very overpriced.  I believe my margarita was 15.95. And tasted like a 4.00 drink. If you have money to burn. This is the right place..  Never see me there again.  Try mellow mushroom for 3.75. 20 ounce draft beers."}
{"text":"Good food good atmosphere good service. Liked the tacos a lot but we weren't terribly impressed with the salads and we casually mentioned it to our server who told the management who came over apologized and comp'd them even though we told him that wasn't necessary. Very positive review of the service!"}
{"text":"Arrived and sat at the bar, asked the bar tender who was more focused on the game than the service 3 times for water with lemon, finally with our appetizers we got water with no lemon. The appetizer wasn't right, the kitchen didn't have half the ingredients. They did give us the appetizers for free being that they are wrong. My girlfriend and I continued to ask for water refills, and not receiving them. We normally sit at the bar cause you receive better service but this was far from the case, after having to continuously ask for water refills my girlfriend was very upset, having worked in the industry for many years she knows this is rule one, so we left with no tip given and my girlfriend who had eaten there many times before, stating that she'll never return. I'm not returning due to the bad food and horrible service."}
{"text":"Happy hour during the day is solid! Shrimp tacos were very, very good...nice servings! Service was fabulous!! Went mid day Sat, not too crowded! Be careful during weeknight happy hour--it can be packed!"}
{"text":"Came here today with a friend for lunch because she had told me about the mango margarita. We sat at the bar and when we ordered the Mango margarita the bartender said they were \"out\". I was kinda bummed out and when we asked what other margaritas were good she said she didn't know because she's only 20... Not sure why you would have a bartender who can't taste the drinks. Overall the food and drinks were ok nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great food, delicious (and reasonably priced!) drinks, awesome atmosphere. I haven't had anything to eat or drink that I haven't liked. As far as bartenders go, you can't beat Nick and Wally. They are both awesome at making drinks and helping to ensure that a great time is had by everyone. Ana is a fantastic server- always making sure everyone has whatever they need and always has a smile on her face even when she is super busy. I definitely recommend checking Modern Margarita out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Another great experience here. 2nd time there, I seriously can't see a reason why its not 5 stars. 
Sunday Happy Hour all day! :) 
Went back again, enjoyed an awesome HH Meal and Drinks! 
Great Guacamole and their House Salsa was great too! Love their Chipotle Salsa! 
This time, I went for the Pork Tacos on the HH menu! Delicious! Al Pastor is what they really are, and I love Pineapple Pork!! 
Great service again, very attentive waiter."}
{"text":"It's a cool looking place. Have eaten there 3 times already. The tacos are small and if you are a big eater you might need to order two sets of 3 but they are good (the chicken tacos are very good) except for the Veggie tacos which are kind of only mushrooms and tortilla.  At night it turns into a cool bar. They even have a DJ on weekend nights and the one I heard was great. So for food 3 stars for margaritas and ambiance 5 stars. So average 4 stars."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We met friends there on a Sunday night. It wasn't busy, but our service was terrible. I understand when a restaurant is understaffed and it takes a while... but in this case we all got the sense the server just didn't give a shit. The food was mediocre and tap beer wasn't very cold. With other restaurant options in the area, I doubt we'll go back to this one."}
{"text":"We were out-of-towners looking for a spot to have dinner/drinks- Modern Margarita hit the spot!  My sisters and I were taken of by Matt- and he was THE BOMB! He gave great recommendations and was super friendly.  The tacos and margaritas were awesome and the service was superb! We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place?! Hands down best tequila bar I've found in the north valley. Food is always spectacular, and their staff is extremely knowledgeable on their vast selection of tequilas. If you can make your way to High Street I highly recommend checking out Modern Margarita. We were even greeted and thanked on our way out by the manager Ben. Gotta love a cool new place that provides a personal touch. We'll definitely be back for another round!"}
{"text":"We tried Modern Margarita on a weeknight and didn't read the reviews beforehand, but as many previous commenters have noted, it was So Loud! The music was way too loud for a restaurant. It wasn't a Saturday night at a club!

Besides the music, we had a pretty decent experience. The margaritas were good. We ordered a salsa flight, which was ok but it really seems they should offer complimentary chips and salsa. Alas, we had to pay for mediocre salsa and they were small portions so we had to pay again when we requested more. 

We ordered tacos and a salad and both were decent. I'm not sure this will become a regular place for us but we'll likely try it at least once more before we write it off totally. In the meantime, turn down that music!"}
{"text":"Had a team lunch here recently and the vibe is like it's name, modern yet still cool.  Had the Chicken Street Tacos and they were delicious.  The guac is good too and try their salsa flight.  I'm going back at Happy Hour next!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas I've ever had! The staff is very friendly and food was amazing!! Very clean and modern cute restaurant, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual dinner.  We were lucky to be there for $5 Monday margaritas and they were great.  Had pork and shrimp tacos for dinner as well as the chips and salsa. Both were delicious!  The wait staff was super friendly and attentive.  Nice place to sit outside to dine and enjoy the weather.  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I was immediately greeted with friendly faces. Nicolas was our waiter and very patient since it was our first time. He also had great recommendations like the house rustic margarita and steak tacos. We went with the mixed taco platter and was impressed. The lettuce option was awesome. Wasn't a fan of the pork tacos but hey.. That is 4 out of 5 different tacos that we loved. Definitely a taco paradise! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but a little pricey. 2 of us drop $50 every time we walk in there. Hit them at happy hour.  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"If you are going to call yourself, \"Modern Margarita\", it's expected to have more creative margaritas and a few more choices than just seven.  The food portions were small but good.
We were having a fun time up to the point that I asked for a draft beer and the Asian bartender poured a glass with two inches of head and then poured another glass of beer into it.  When he served it to me, I asked for a new beer and he said, \"No\"."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas. I liked the peach colored one I can't recall the name of it...sunrise prickly pear...something like that. Service was super slow and boy was our waitress confused when we wished to order a second round of drinks. What?! Why?! I ordered the vegetarian tostadas. They were small, but tasty. Love their paper chandeliers."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Yes, it's trying to be a trendy Millennial hangout, but just remember that it's your 40+ crowd that has the money to support your business.  The veggie tacos leave a lot to be desired...sour goat cheese didn't compliment the other flavors.  Service was excellent...no complaints there."}
{"text":"I have never been here before.  We decided to stop by and have a drink on our way to another place.  I had one of the best Margaritas!!  Morelike 3!  I definitely recommend this place.  Great atmosphere and awesome service!  Marie was our bartender and she was very friendly!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I like just about everything at this place.  It's a great fun happening place to bring friends. I bring friends here when I want to make sure they have a good time. All of the tacos are good. The bean dip, nachos, wings, and steak fries are all very good. Hard to find steak fries anymore. Love them."}
{"text":"The carne asana tacos are the only thing that made me reach deep and pull out a second star. Even they are not as good as they once were. I used to come here almost weekly for the first year or so they were open, but I've only been a handful of times in 2015 and i would be shocked if I return. Steady decline with every visit. Service overall was always a little spotty here, but the bartenders used to be AWESOME and service was always great at the bar if you could get a seat. No sign of the guys behind the bar on my last couple weekend visits so I'd assume they jumped off the sinking ship. The overall vibe of this joint just seems very stale, if that makes sense. I can't really single any one thing out that drove me to make this review, I guess I'm just a little chapped because I used to enjoy going to modern and it was convenient to meet friends or groups. I'm aware that the guy who owns it also has a bunch of other subpar places around the valley so maybe it's just the case of this one also falling into its inevitable niche of basic-ness. Too bad.

Finer details:
- CHIPS AND SALSA: not bad, but not good either. And they charge for them. Which is fine if they are great.

- CARNE ASADA: very good, just ok last couple times.

-MARGARITAS: Meh. Clooney used to be my fav but tastes really unbalanced these days

- AMBIANCE: sleek decor, nice patio. Should be a much sexier vibe, but current staff - and it would seem management - hold it back. Stale energy. Food isn't good enough to try to be a real restaurant."}
{"text":"We checked out Modern Margarita this past Friday, as we live across the street and have been wanting to for the past couple weeks. Couldn't have been more pleased to have this addition to our neighborhood! We enjoyed so much that we came back last night as well. The decor, the vibe, and drinks are great and happy hour had some good deals. The bartenders are awesome and on top of it - It got pretty busy Friday night and we never had to wait too long for a drink or anything that we needed. Both Madison and Curtis, who took care of us, were extremely personable and fun. I am a tequila lover and they have a very nice selection... I tried a GREAT tequila that i had never heard of - Casa amigos i believe. (I had a few that night, so who knows!) 

Carne asada was one of the better i've ever had. Not something i expected, but pleasantly surprised. Chips and salsa were also delicious and tasted very fresh and homemade. 

We will definitely be back...well...again! Cant wait to do some Saturday/sunday day drinking on the patio. See you soon!

Pro: good vibe, great bartenders, carne asada, drinks

Con: none. Maybe a little more upbeat music... but we were there during happy hour and on a weekday night, so im assuming the music gets more appropriate later on the weekend nights."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Modern Margarita regularly for the past few months since I moved to Phoenix from Minnesota. The service is always top notch and the bartender(Nick?)/manager(missed her name but an attractive blonde) provide great service on a regular basis. I always feel welcomed here and the drinks are legitimately some of the best I've ever had. I would recommend this little hidden gem in the desert to anyone who has yet to visit this spot. Tacos are great drinks are even better, definitely check this spot out!!"}
{"text":"Im giving two stars because it used to be ok. over all This place was a lot better when they first opened. Their drinks have become weak, their chips changed and now taste stale and have that thick store bought texture and artificial yellow color to them, and food almost always comes out cold. We used to be fans... Definitely not coming back. There service is always horrible as well, their women's uniforms are trashy and unattractive (one shoulder dingy shirts and yoga pants) , not to mention no one seems to know what the heck they are doing. Had high hopes for this place but now it's just a bunch of trashy kids running around serving bad food and bad drinks, but not before stopping to give each other piggy back rides down the patio and taking self photos to presumably post online. What happened to professionalism in the work place?

Don't waste your time ."}
{"text":"Went here for my bday this weekend and had such a blast! A classy, fun, upbeat place that isn't crawling with drunks (like on mill). The only disadvantage was that it was really chilly in there but if you're dancing around it's to your advantage :) Five stars for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place has a cool, relaxed vibe and a hoppin' atmosphere. It used to be one of our go-to spots. However, my 2-star rating comes from server's knowledge of the food menu and food allergies. I am gluten free (Celiac, not just a life choice) and I acknowledge that not all of my favorite restaurants will be able to accommodate my needs. However, EVERY time we come here the server gives us a different answer. Or a flighty \"umm maybe? I think it's GF? Yeah it is. I'm pretty sure?\" (server nodding head uncontrollably). I'm glad you think it's GF, but go ask and get a straight answer. It matters.

Our first visit:
\"Yes our menu is very gluten free. You can eat pretty much anything that's not fired....even the chips.\" (answer stayed the same despite questioning and asking to double check)

2nd visit:
\"Oh no, not the chips they are fried with everything else. And actually not the house made salsa, that has soy sauce... but everything else is good.\" 

Hmmm...

3rd visit:
\"You can have any tacos. All the sauces are GF.\"

4th:
\"Oh, yeah pretty much nothing is gluten free. The aioli is not gluten free. But you can have corn tortillas.\"

5th:
\"Oh no, nothing. You can have a lettuce wrap, but yes the sauce is all GF.\"

6th and probably last visit:
\"Yes you can definitely have corn tortillas, we just won't heat them up. The sauce is GF.\"

Long story short.... if you actually need to be conscious of what you eat and it matters to you health, this probably isn't the best place to go. 

Will I go here again for convenience and a cocktail? Maybe. 
Will I eat here? Probably not a good idea, unless I just stick to plain lettuce.

I get that it's a \"pain\" when someone has food allergies or special requests. It would be great if the servers could be a little more educated on what the options actually are and maybe get on the same page. It has a great atmosphere and it's fun place. I would love to call it a go-to again."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual. Of course, the drinks are always great! A bit disappointed, I had to sit at the bar, the hostess said when a booth became available she would move me to it.  Four booths became available in the hour and a half that I was there. The hostess never did move me. She always sat the next customer that arrived at the booths. If there is a next time, I'd rather wait for booth instead of waiting at the bar."}
{"text":"Went to Modern Margarita with some friends on a Saturday night. I made a reservation but could have been seated without one as it was not overly crowded at 830pm. 
Fun vibe, the decor was casual, I will say they could and should rethink their chairs, hard metal and not comfortable at all. Maybe ask for a booth. Music was not too loud so it was easy to talk and visit with each other. Good service, our server was attentive and didn't hover. Great margaritas!  (one should hope so). If you like spicy try the Jalapeño margarita, just enough spice and not overwhelming. 
Fresh guacamole appetizer was tasty and was very fresh, decent salsa (I'm partial to Jalapeño Infernos salsa) but still fresh and not very spicy, although I do prefer a little kick it was still good with the fresh corn chips. I ordered 3 different tacos off the ala cart menu, carne asada, shrimp, and chicken. The carne asada and shrimp were very good, nice flavors,not spicy all topped topped fresh cabbage. The shrimp was my favorite. The chicken however was disappointing, it did not have any type of Mexican food qualities to it other than it was a \" taco\"  it tasted like barbecue chicken, not at all what I was expecting and it just didn't pair well with the other foods. If I could give  Modern Margarita 4.5 stars I would because really just the chicken taco was the only part I didn't care for, well the chair too but I'll just ask for a booth next time. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and relax! Atmosphere is fun and light. 

Went in on a Sunday Night for an all day Sunday HH! So great - the HH menu has many options, especially the cocktails and margaritas! 

Service was great as well. Don't remember our servers name but he was great and even gave us a free shot from the bar! Definitely going back on another Sunday or any other day for that matter!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! 
-7:30pm - ran out of 2 of their more unique margaritas

- They charge for salsa when you order guac and chips ...kind of like charging for ketchup!

-waited literally 10 min for silverware had to get manager

- wrong order brought out 2 times 

- shrimp tacos couldn't find the shrimp through the cabbage.

- was told credit card declined (knew was impossible but still embarrassing) gave other card ... \"Oh it's a problem on our end\"

If you are going to be a bar + restaurant... food has to be considered too.  And if you're a margarita bar you might want to have your signature drinks available!

Too bad was hoping to have a cool Mexican place to come back to but nope will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this place - great food and great staff that keeps us coming back. You cannot beat the carne asada tacos and salad. The best hands down. Best place to hang out with friends after a long day."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks,  Happy Hour was very reasonable. Ashley was an excellent server."}
{"text":"After working three 12 hour shifts in a row, I certainly look forward to my first night off for dinner and drinks.  Told my husband about modern margarita and he was up for trying somewhere new. I did notice that they only received 3 1/2 stars on yelp which typically means it's not worthy of attending but the first few reviews were good and the HH menu looked satisfactory.  Fast forward- it took 20minutes for us to get our chips and salsa (average at best) after we stopped two employees & told them & both employees told us \"food runner is setting up for party\" - as the customer, I really don't care, that's not my problem but understandable....however, the people who sat down at the tables behind us (who arrived 20 min after us) were eating chips and salsa!!! we continued to wait patiently...The second time we told the manager, we also said that we have been waiting to order more food as well as my husband sat with an empty drink (people in the hospitality industry should automatically be looking for empty glasses). The manager nor either bartenders asked to take our order or offer another drink, even after we casually put the empty pint glass on the edge of the bar!  Ended up telling the manager we just wanted to close our tab and leave.  He did comp our meal and apologized, unfortunately, there were too many mistakes and poor service that we did not want to stay.  Yard house is where we went and they never disappoint! No wonder why they are extremely successful!!"}
{"text":"No service, that's none, by female bartender on Sunday.  I left and will never return.  Pass the word."}
{"text":"Try the vegetarian tacos- no joke, they're really good. I'm not super keen on really sweet drinks, but the Yoga Margarita hits the spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The tacos are delicious!! My favorite are the shrimp tacos. My husband can't get enough of the Cucumber Serrano Margarita, which is pretty tasty. Adrienne is an awesome server! She's on top of things and always knows when we're ready for another round. We'll def continue to be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!! Food was overpriced for what it was. Service was almost nonexistent. They messed up 1 order & took 20 minutes to bring the right one, dirty glasses as shown in the photo, I even had to go to the bar to get my drinks because it was faster than our waitress. To close it all out I am writing my first Yelp review while waiting for my check for over 25 minutes. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Loved the margaritas here!  They use fresh ingredients, not a mix bought at the store. The Rustic and Clooney are my favorites.  For food, the tacos are terrific there. It's a great place to meet friends and enjoy the cocktails."}
{"text":"I came in the other day for dinner and drinks. My server Matt was great, very friendly and helpful. He really knows his margaritas! Thanks and try a Clooney next time you are in there."}
{"text":"We have had good experiences there in the past. But last weekend, I made a reservation online for happy hour, and got there to find no table was held for us. We had to crowd into the open seating area in the front. not conducive to easy eating or conversation. Why offer online reservations if there is no table that will be held?"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends, food is amazing! ambiance is good as well, you can enjoy the night weather in AZ at night by sitting on the patio. service is good but would've been a bit faster on the orders of our drinks. great location highly recommend it."}
{"text":"All you need to know : yes, get the taco flight! If you're going with a group this is a perfect way to try a little bit of everything. The fish tacos and the veggie tacos were the standout for me. The fish were perfectly crispy without being overly greasy. I didn't expect to like the veggie tacos over the others but the sauce they used and the sautéed veggies were just so full of flavor. The margaritas were strong; however, there was way too much ice in them which watered it down pretty quickly. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the guacamole- not enough of a \"kick\" for me...but the salsas were great! The atmosphere was hip, service was great, food  was delicious - if I lived in AZ, this would definitely be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! I live really close and when this place first opened I had to check it out because I was attracted by their whole set up. I usually come here to have a few drinks with some friends at the bar when we want to just sit and talk somewhere not to crowded.
Music is good and so is the food! All the times I been here it was great service and I'll definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious and obviously fresh food - fantastic flavor combinations for the tacos.  Incredibly fast and courteous service.  Menu is based solely on taco combinations - so don't go looking for a large array of american/mexican entrees.  

One drawback:  Manager should go over cleanliness policies with staff...one young gentleman was playing with his hair constantly while rolling silverware/napkins out on the deck."}
{"text":"Nikki,
All I know is the tab was $60 +$30. That's  $90 not  $130. If you can forward the receipt that would be great. Thanks for responding."}
{"text":"So, like the car rental counter in a Seinfeld episode, they can take the reservation, but they can't keep the reservation!  

Kept us waiting 45 minutes past promised time, we left!"}
{"text":"I didn't get margaritas (only drafts), but the food was very disappointing. I got the pork, shrimp, and fish tacos. The pork was basically BBQ pulled pork (mediocre at that. The shrimp was insanely spicy, with little flavor and only three pieces of shrimp ($7 for that?!). The fish taco was good. I asked for sour cream, and was told that the restaurant doesn't have any. You have 30 tacos on your menu, and you don't provide sour cream?! I also got the sampler appetizer with cheese, beans, and guac. These were good, and thank goodness as my meal was not edible. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Sat outside at the bar. Happy hour hand crafted margaritas. Just had drinks and nachos. They were great. Cool set up so you can be outside but at the bar."}
{"text":"Slow service. Bland food, the chicken on my tacos was flavorless and very dry.  They charge for chips and salsa, never ever have I been to a Mexican restaurant that has. Never refilled my soda.  Friends margarita had literally 2 flakes of salt on the glass.  Only gave it 2 stars because they took 5 dollars off my friends steak salad because she didn't eat it, it was really that bad."}
{"text":"Not a big fan.  The place was not very busy, but service was still not very good.  Drinks were very over priced & watered down.  Chicken tacos tasted good but you cannot combine types of tacos. You must get all 3 the same.  Lots of options in downtown Chandler.  We won't be wasting the time here again."}
{"text":"Mediocre drinks.  Mediocre food. Mediocre service.  Douchey loud techno lounge music.  I tried it 1/2 off with a Groupon.  Meh."}
{"text":"We just had a fantastic,  delicious, enjoyable experience at Modern Margarita a groupon brought us here. We ordered the 15 taco flight ( comes with rice and black beans) which is a combination of chicken, carne asada , pork, fish tacos. My favorite was the pork with pineapple salsa topping and avocado sauce, delish ! My husband favored the carne asada & pork pineapple as well.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu & ingredients and had a friendly attitude. I also had the rustic Margarita which was super yummy.. $5 on happy hour (even better). My experience in whole was very enjoyable the atmosphere is casual and cool. I appreciate the manager coming around to check in with their customers experience. We will look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We went to Modern Margarita to start a night of celebration. We sat at the bar and had great service. They made delicious drinks and we got the chips and guacamole. It was the best guac I've had in a long time. Great atmosphere, staff, food and drinks. We'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for Sunday Funday. My Sunday was not fun because of the experience I received. Be wary that the \"complimentary\" chips and salsa is not. Being charged for a salsa refill without any warning was a lovely surprise on the check. What Mexican food place has ever charged you for a salsa refill?! 

If you want any sort of service don't sit on the patio either. We were neglected to say the least and our waitress dropped the check randomly when we were going to order more drinks. 

Terrible reggae playlist."}
{"text":"Sub par at best, our waitress was rushed even though it was slow and order came out wrong."}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about this place, but I was severely let down by the entire experience. 

For starters, the house salsa was actually marinara sauce. I wouldn't call myself a salsa expert, but I think I know the difference between salsa and a can of tomato paste with oregano mixed into it.
Secondly, I split a plate of nachos with two other people and we all agree; it was just chips covered in ranch dressing and some canned peppers for garnish.
Lastly, our server was extremely rude to us. It was a slow night, and she should've been happy to have a table of 8 people (6 of whom were buying expensive drinks) because her income most likely relies on tips. Everyone was very kind to her, and we received nothing but snide comments in return. The icing on the cake was her and four other staff members also closing our tabs and telling us they were starting to close at 10 pm on a night where they were open till 12."}
{"text":"Family went with a groupon deal and we were all very satisfied and plan on returning. Got the taco flight, which gives you five different kinds of tacos, three of each. It seemed like each one was better than the last. My personal favorites were the chicken and the carne asada. The pico de gallo and guacamole was excellent as well. Tried a blueberry \"craft\" margarita, also pretty good. Bunch of options for margaritas as far as flavors and tequila options. Overall great visit!"}
{"text":"This is the third time we have been here. Most recently on a Sunday. The service is very slow. There were 2 tables served ahead of us although we had put our order (0f 4) ahead of the others. The order also came out wrong for 2 of the individuals with us. Don't get me wrong, I thought the crowd size was small and so the service should be a bit faster and more accurate. Disappointed overall."}
{"text":"This place is great. For lunch, happy
Hour or a late night taco. Fun vibe, yummy and fresh street tacos"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my aunt and cousin. We shared to mahi mahi and veggie tacos they were great! I love the salsa trio as well. We also had the prickly pear margaritas which were great tasting and pretty strong. Definitely don't want more than one during lunch. The waitress even found a hair clip for my aunt who just wanted her hair out of her face. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"The place had a lively atmosphere with good margaritas and excellent tacos.  The prices are a little high but that is expected for the location.

Our server was attentive, friendly, and helpful. The chips and salsa were warm."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there for the first time it was amazing experience the food was great and the service was impeccable. Halfway through our meal the general manager (Nate) stopped by our table just to check on everything which speaks volumes about the establishment and how it's ran. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is the most fun Mexican restaurant in the East Valley. The Margaritas are hand made and amazing. They will even tailor them to your preferences, sweeter or more tart. The food is delicious. Go enjoy."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant! The decor and art are fun the atmosphere is relaxed and the people are nice. The food is great and the wide variety of Margaritas is amazing! I had the \"Modern Margarita\", same name as the restaurant, and it was uniquely delicious."}
{"text":"What an excellent restaurant. I would recommend going to anyone interested in a good meal."}
{"text":"Good HH spot. Great guac and good size portions of meat on the tacos. Wife and I like the drink specials and really enjoy their patio.  Every experience we've had there with server's and staff has been very good.  A friend had a baby and they were very accomodating with both our large group and seating arrangements with a high chair."}
{"text":"Meh is about the best I can say for this smaller High Street club with a unique indoor/outdoor Bar. When you first walk in I can't help but feeling sorry for the DJ crammed in a corner in a space the size of a tiny broom closet. Regardless, the food, especially their tacos are very good and the cold beer is very good as well.... Why only 1 star? Quite simply stated, the manager and service sucks ass. I have worked in the hospitality industry for many many years, and providing amazing hospitality and customer service is a requirement if you wish to be successful in the hospitality industry. I am only compelled to speak out if someone is deserving of praise and recognition for amazing service, and I will also call someone out if they suck and are damaging the business and its reputation resulting in me having a bad experience. This establishment has a member of management that I later came to find is named Rich or Rick, and I have not been this unimpressed and annoyed with a service provider, let alone a representative of management in a long time. Any bartender working behind the bar who is worth his salt better know and understand some basic customer service requirements and expectations, and the first one is you acknowledge new arrivals immediately even if you can't serve them right away, and you can throw me a head nod or a wink or any kind of nonverbal message especially when I walk in right in front of you and walk past you to the far side of the bar. Unfortunately Rico Sauve was too engrossed in flirting with several young females to be disturbed with any new guests coming through the door. OK OK maybe I'm being a little harsh, and maybe this fellow hasn't seen any action in a while so I'll cut him a break, but just one... I'm surprised the bar didn't collapse or at least have a permanent imprint of his forearm embedded in it from him leaning on the bar talking to these girls nonstop while my thirst level was growing exponentially. I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel as he headed my way to take my order so I thought, but he walked right past me sitting with no cocktail napkin in front of me and grabbed a liquor bottle and went back to his gaggle of girls. After this I was about to get up and head somewhere else when a  young lady appeared behind the bar and approach me to greet me and take my drink/food order, served me a pint, then left the bar to serve more food... OK so I now have my cold beer in front of me and I continue to watch the Rico Sauve show kind of like not being able to turn away from watching a bad car wreck scene. Over the course of 18 minutes several shots were poured for the girls by Rico as he continued to ignore the needs of other patrons in a timely manner, which is a cardinal sin of a solo bartender. Shockingly, Rico made his way over to me got me another pint FINALLY! He was nice, but not sincere, and his service was robotic. I can dig that some people have an agenda, or are having a bad day, or are ready to move on to a different career or whatever. However, people come to a business for SERVICE, and when you volunteer to accept a job it is your responsibility to provide the expected service! If you can't or won't, you should consider a different line of work... The gaggle of girls and I wrapped up at about the same time.  I paid my tab including a barely deserved tip, and I watched that girl group closely and never did see money change hands for this entire experience. Maybe I missed it... I am a consultant and I get paid to observe and advise on improving business operations and profitability, and sadly I must say this fellow Rico does not deserve to carry the title of manager in any way shape or form, and hopefully someday his superior(s) will see the big picture long-term damage being done by this type of behavior in any customer service business. Did I mention they have really good tacos?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !  We went to Modern Margarita for Happy Hour.  We were first served warm chips and salsa and then we had orders of chicken tacos.  The chips and the tacos tasted great.  The service was outstanding. Our waiter, Matt, was attentive, friendly, and knew the menu.  There is no question that we will come back again."}
{"text":"Such a fun place!! Rick was awesome bartender!! Happy hour was a blast - loved the clooney and mango fresh \"everything\" margaritas. We ordered carne asada tostadas, pork tacos and chicken wings and loved all 3 dishes.  Would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Their Pork tacos were delicious!!!! There long grain rice was out of this world fantastic!!!! Monique was our waitress.  She was very friendly and knew her menu.  We picked her brain with everything on the menu and should answered all our questions! She really knew her stuff and she was always around to check on us without bothering us.  The only bad thing was their frozen margarita machine was broken and that is why we went there and with the name Modern Margarita they should have had a back up machine.  Poor planning on that issue but otherwise great. Will definitely come back and tell my friends!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends come here every Monday to warch the football game. Kyle the bartender is one of the best they have. Fun atmosphere and good food"}
{"text":"So our server was awesome. Told us the straight story(won't mention the name). Sucks to order tacos. They come three to a plate and you must get all three the same. Asked for the manager...states that they can't do it any other way because it would back up the kitchen. WHAT?????  Need new kitchen staff. You can get three different tacos if you order the taco flight however you get 15 tacos!!!  That's great here with your baseball team!!!!  Lol what a joke. Server told us if you get the right manager you can get what you want. Where is the consistency?  Not impressed.

Food was 2 stars at best....Over salted."}
{"text":"This is a fun place! Great food with some unique options. I had the mahi grilled fish taco's in lettuce wrap and they were awesome! It's a little loud in there so it doesn't work well with a large group if you want to hear everyone (we had 6) but it would be great for 4 people. Service was very good as well! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I used to have a greater love for Modern 
Margarita, it used to be one of my favorite spots for happy hour in the whole valley... And then they got new management. The new management team decided to increase the prices and now I wouldn't even call happy hour any kind of deal. I miss the days of $5 margaritas that were actually good. Now the happy hour price is $10+ dollars for a tiny little margarita, and I'm sorry $10 is not a happy hour price. And if you want any kind of special margarita or a margarita that's bigger than two sips you'll be paying $15+ for happy hour price. The joys of a normal happy is going somewhere you love and paying a good price for good food and drinks. The only thing Modern Margarita has going for it any more is that the drinks and food are very good, however, the price is just too expensive for the quantity you get. Quality, great. It's really a shame."}
{"text":"We stopped here for happy hour prior to an event at City North.  The food and margaritas were awesome but the service was terrible!   We sat at the bar and were greeted right away.  The bartender was friendly and made a great suggestion on a house margarita.  After being served our drinks, we never saw her again.  She was still at the bar, but never came to check on us.  We wanted to order food and had to flag down someone to take our order.  Once the food was delivered, no one followed up to see if we needed anything.  We had no plates, napkins or silverware.  After flagging someone to assist us, we enjoyed the food which is the only thing that pulled this rating up!  The food was great!   Still the entire time, we were at the bar, no one checked on us.  There were two bartenders with 5 people at the bar.  At the end of the meal, we had to flag someone down to get the check.   After reviewing the check, we found out that we were overcharged.   Its a shame as the food is awesome, but the service is so bad that we would think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"Come for the margaritas- patio happy hour is a must do while in north Phoenix.  Located in city north near dessert ridge this trendy bar is better for drinks than food.

Many variations of margaritas to be found!!  I always go for anything with chambord.

I wish I could recall the food but all I remember is a huge basket of chips, I liked the salsa and I was buzzed after 1 drink and napping after 2.  Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"You must try this place:  we had the Clooney, the chips&salsa, fried fish taco (awesome), and the chef special taco.  So good!  Bartender was Carlos -- he recommended each choice!"}
{"text":"If you want to hang out and listen to a good DJ this is the place.  The DJ plays different types of music.  And everyone seemed to enjoy it! We had appetizers (wings' salsa & chips and a quesadilla) all was good.  Very casual place.  We came here on a Saturday night.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Margarita to open for month. Its a great location and expect them to have high traffic.  That is why it puzzles me that they would open such a small location and cut the original layout in half. I believe i overheard they share the kitchen with LA Bica. Again, I'm puzzled by that if its true.   

Next they have a horrible problem with flies. They are flying around your Margaritas, food, and you!   Margarita was delicious, not sure its worth a $14.00 price.  Tacos were reasonably priced and lacked 2 corn tortillas.  When you are filling a taco with a lot of ingredients....that 2nd tortilla would be beneficial to support the taco and prevent it from falling apart.   Black beans was the only option, rice was ok. Lack a little flavor, i could taste all the butter that was used and tossed in some corn to add some color.  Overall it was okay, my bubble has been busted and wont be returning unless its for Margarita Happy Hour.  Because that is $3.00 off.  Which seems more reasonable for a 16 oz glass."}
{"text":"Drinks were pre made and service was very very impersonal. Needed help. Bartenders usually make the atmosphere and this one sure did... nobody mingled!"}
{"text":"After the Rockin Taco Street Fest headed to Modern Margarita.  Excellent margaritas of course! Fantastic crispy wings, grilled fish tacos and the complimentary chips & salsa are excellent!  Happy Hour every dang day!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great drinks! Great chicken with agave glaze! But hold on the nachos! Weird cheese! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I can sum this up pretty quickly. 


AMAZING 

Every single thing I ate was amazing. And let's be honest, I'm pretty hard to please. 

Not to mention I filled up on chip because the dip was so good so I wasn't even hungry. And we all know good is less appetizing when you're full. The main course still blew me away. 

Not to mention I typically hate margaritas. The one I had here was also excellent. 

Do yourself a favor and don't miss this."}
{"text":"The only spot in Arizona to get the best margaritas ever! There happy hours are the best! There atmosphere is great too. Best experience hands down."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this cute place!! I've been here 3 separate times and have had great service and great food. The wings are sooo good, as well as the quesadilla. ALSO, their margaritas actually have alcohol in them!! You may be thinking, well duh? But no. I've been to many places where the margaritas are all mixers with very little alcohol. Not here! They are delicious. Try the spicy mango marg! We recently moved super close to high street, so this is our new favorite spot"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour and had two margaritas (green goddess & hot mango) and split the chicken tacos and dip duo (guac & queso).  The margaritas were good - they tasted very fresh and had a lot of flavor.  The guac and tacos were also awesome.  The service was great.

The online happy hour menu however is old and doesn't match up with the current happy hour specials.  The margaritas seemed a bit expensive for happy hour prices in general."}
{"text":"This was our second time here.  We've enjoyed the food and Happy Hour, but HATE their so-called reservation system.  Don't make a reservation through their \"Reserve a Table\" link on their website or OpenTable and expect to actually have a reservation.  When we arrived at our reservation time we were advised that they don't really take reservations and that our table would be ready in 30-40 minutes.  Perhaps they should let their customers know this when accepting reservations."}
{"text":"Fantastic, wonderful, amazing. Love this place so much! Bartenders and servers alike are great. Drinks/Food is exceptional :)"}
{"text":"Decided to check out their Sunday Happy Hour a few weeks ago.  Came in around 4pm and the place was about 20% full.  On Sundays their Happy Hour Drink prices run starting before noon so it wasn't surprising to see a couple of people on their way to hammered.  We ordered almost every app on the HH Menu and none disappointed.  For a total bill of under $70 we ate and drank like Kings.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ah, this used to be my absolute favorite place.  My friends and family would go here multiple times a week, and this was our go to spot!  The happy hour was the absolute best, and the prices were fantastic.  

We didn't go for a little, until my sister and I went and everything had changed.  Prices changed, management changed, and the food even tasted different.  

Moral of this story, we won't be going back :("}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and sat at outside bar area. Bartender very friendly and helpful. Offered chips and salsa. I said \"sure.\" They were good. Bill comes and I've been charged $4 for salsa. From other reviews, looks like I got ripped off since the first bowl is supposed to be free. Anyway, carne Asada tacos were terrible. Meat was cold, chewy, flavorless. Avocado slices on top were clearly brown. How do you not notice that when bringing to the customer--they were right on top?!? \"Chimichurri\" was really tomatillo salsa. Huge rings of barely grilled onion on taco were inedible, due to size and lack of caramelization. They have one kind of Chardonnay. They were out of it. It's shocking that they are a sister restaurant to La Bocca, which is quite good. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Since I'm personal friends with the people of this place, I'll write my review strictly about the facts.

The place is super cool and with an amazing patio. 

The massive bar is awesome and pretty comfortable furniture.

Also since I'm a Mexican food expert (or at least I think so) the guacamole is by far the closest to the real thing that you can find in AZ and the salsas are super tasty.

They also have a Mega Margarita that is great for sharing (you know, sharing is caring).

Besides my friendship with this guys, I seriously think this is a great addition to the area!

Cheers

PS The bathrooms are spacious and they have a mirror, so you can check your smile without having to worry about embarrassment (to make sure there's no guacamole in your teeth)"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday a couple days back with family and was pretty disappointed in the food. I would give this place one star but the atmosphere is pretty hip and I appreciate that so I'll add a star but ONLY for that. There were 5 of us and not one of us liked the food unfortunately. The \"medium\" burger we ordered was rock hard, and the salads were not very flavorful. Another one of us ordered tacos and they were bland and couldn't be finished due to the taste (or lack thereof). The salsas for this place were decent and then I find out after the fact that they charge $6 for chips with the trio of salsas (what?). The server should have mentioned that they charge for chips. The moscow mule I ordered was too sweet (think melted lime-flavored Otter Pop) -- I'll  be back here but only for drinks that come out of a bottle from a manufacturer.. Sorry MM, I really wanted to like you guys and the manager was super-cool (comped a couple of dishes) and friendly but there are too many other places to go around here that have great food and cocktails for the price you're charging! I'm sad because I'm really rooting for City North too! :["}
{"text":"Been there 2 times once a few years ago and it was a great experience. Food is good the tacos and margaritas especially. I went back recently and the staff seemed to be too preoccupied with each other. The food was still good however I'm not sure I would go back because the place seemed filthy especially behind the booths, on the light fixtures and bottles above the bar."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place and was pleasantly surprised.  Atmosphere was cool, service was quick and friendly, and the margaritas were tasty.  Tried the queso and chips which were better than average so I'd be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this place countless times,  and every time has been delightful. Saturday night was no exception. Our server Nick was swamped, but made us feel like we were his only table. The tacos here are insanely good, and the Clooney margarita is a must. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, cheap Mexican bar food, poor service. Told the server I had a friend on their way and ordered her a drink but server said they have to be present... hmmmm check our ARS 4.244.23 law does not state this. So stop playing lawyer and start taking care of your tables. Same comment to all other staff, pay attention instead of hanging around the end of the bar talking and hugging each other.
Table was not clean and on the booth floor was everything from last week.
I always tip, this one tested me out.
I don't like to write poor reviews but this was out of line.
I'll pass on this place next time ."}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back! Great atmosphere, yummy drinks and excellent tacos! The bartenders were great, had a couple cocktails while waiting for our table (server was nice but a tad spacey) but overall it was a good experience. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the city north location which was absolutely amazing!! Not sure what it is about this location but it's been hit or miss the last 4 times... if you're looking for a place to gather with friends, yes it's a great location. But the quality of service is not up to par with the other one. I know many places can have \"off nights\" which is why I gave it a few chances. But overall I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! The place has a cool vibe and they just started bringing a DJ in for the weekend. Came in here with friends for lunch on a Sunday and they were featuring happy hour all day and the DJ was awesome!!! He played a good mix of music and it definitely added to the ambiance of the place. Great place and I'm definitely considering myself a \"regular\"!!!! Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Server Jordan did an excellent job on a busy weekend night! Coming back again soon"}
{"text":"A place I wouldn't go again. It was around lunch time on a weekend and there was only 1 bartender and 1 waitress. Service was ehh and the food not so good. The waitress was nice but she took forever to get our order and refill our drinks. They should get more waiters  They were weird about choosing a variety of tacos if you chose veggie tacos then that is what you had to get, it may have changed now since I went months ago. Their tacos had no flavor and was very bland."}
{"text":"We descended on this place for happy hour and a early dinner. We were in the mood for some chips and salsa and tacos. We arrived  little past 5 on Tuesday. They had some really good happy hour prices, so we ordered couple of drinks and ordered the flight of salsas and guacamole. Then we each ordered 3 tacos and split some steak fries. She ordered the chicken and I got the pork tacos.                                                          Overall I thought the food was pretty good but nothing special. I am hard to please though, cause my lady is Hispanic and her family cooks some of the most amazing Mexican food I've ever eaten.  The great thing about this place is the happy hour and the prices.  We paid a little over 30 for couple of drinks, salsas and tacos. Not bad at all. The service was good though and the food came out quickly.  I would go back again but prolly try something different."}
{"text":"Ok sure it's freezing, but when you pay 9.00 for a tostada you should get better.  A freakin vegan could eat the Carne tostada and feel good about themselves.  Maybe they should change the name to saladstada or fauxstada."}
{"text":"Wow! A+! We had such a fun time here with the family! The food was really great, but the service- even better. Our server, Matthew, went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect! Will definitely be back to lounge on the patio and indulge in delicious margaritas... I love all of the snapdragons outside the patio so after I have a couple drinks I can make them sing..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a busy night and couldn't have asked for better service! Bartenders were friendly and made some tasty margaritas too. 
The house salsa was awesome! Spicy, but not too much that you lost the flavor. First round of chips and salsa is on the house and after that they charge you, but really it's such a big basket we didn't need another one. Really enjoyed the tacos, especially the carnitas! 
Overall a fun place with great service, prices and food!"}
{"text":"We tried Modern Margarita for the first time.  I concur with other reviewers, it does not make sense when you order tacos all of them have to be the same with no exception.
We have never been to a Mexican Restaurant where they did not allow you to mix and match the type of \"menu\" taco.
The way we got around that was to have different people order different kinds of tacos and then swap them out on our plates.
The fish tacos and the pulled pork were our favorites.
The fish tacos came with pico de Gallo, spiced Aioli, cilantro, onion and cabbage.  There was not a lot of ingredients in each taco which is why I only gave them three stars.
The pork taco was advertised as having:  pineapple, avocado crema, cilantro, onion and cabbage.  While the favors were good, we could not find evidence of the avocado crema and the flavor of the pineapple kind of overpowered the small amount of pork on the tacos.      
We like that the restaurant has a sink outside the restrooms (and since there is only one of each) this comes in handy to wash your hands in-between courses without having to wait in line for the restroom.
Margarita was good but in a very small glass.  We are used to a larger margarita glass in other Scottsdale restaurants for $10.00, but since it was made well it made up for the small size.
Chips warm, and were just thick and crispy enough (not over fried).  Salsa had a very nice flavor to it.  
Note:   if you want extra salsa you have to pay, so watch how you use the very small bowl brought to your table if you want to put some on anything you order.  It seemed odd to us that you would have to pay for extra salsa when you are ordering meals off the menu.  For happy hour - fine, but when you are ordering dinner??
Our waiter was helpful.  When we told him it was our first time there he told us a little about their menu.
We did not feel rushed for service, although we went at an off-time of day and would not expect to be rushed out.
Additionally, we concur with the other reviewer about the air conditioning.  We certainly were not going to sit outside in 115 heat to be under a mister only to feel hot AND sticky as a result."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a love/hate relationship with its yelpers....wasn't sure what to expect....so we headed over with our Groupon in hand and....I loved it! 

It's located in City North....a quiet ghost town/pseudo city scape, dotted with a handful of trendy bars and interesting restaurants...

When you walk into Modern Margarita, you feel like you're walking right into the patio. There isn't a bad seat in the house. Huge double sided bar is about 40% of the seating, then a few tables inside and the rest outside. 

Great atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon, beautiful weather to be sitting outside...music wasn't loud at all...opposed to what I have read elsewhere, may have been time of day. 

Service wasn't outstanding, but it was consistent and pretty good. 

Started off with a Sonora Margarita...pretty strong, and my husband had a pomegranate cosmo, which I liked better...very refreshing.

We ordered the salsa trio and chips, free refills :) and an order of guac, which was yum! I really liked the green salsa and fresh pico de gallo...wasn't thrilled with the red salsa, had a lot of cumin, which I'm not a fan of. 

For lunch I had the steak street tacos on flour tortillas which I really liked. Well marinated and tender steak with slices of avocado. Came with three street tacos which was plenty. 

My husband had the chili burger with cheese and garlic fries. He said it was really good, and the beef was very tasty. He especially enjoyed the garlic fries.

The prices weren't that bad. I thought for the nice relaxed atmosphere, good food and service, the prices were spot on. The serving sizes aren't huge, but they are definitely sufficient to fill you up.

I enjoyed my lunch, really liked the atmosphere....next time we might try sitting at the bar for a different experience. Nice place, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times. 

We were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.  
One of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it's not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.  

I'll never return!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Place was not packed, probably 70% full. 
I won't go back and won't recommend Modern Margarita. Very poor, slow, inattentive service. Food is bland and over priced for what you get.  Good to place to catch a beer and the game but don't go for the food. There are much. Water choices in Chandler."}
{"text":"Sometime between getting knocked up to popping it out they got rid of my favorite margarita (the yoga) which is very depressing. It was the only alcoholic drink that I craved throughout my pregnancy and husband and I only half joked that he would bring me that drink to my hospital bed after I gave birth. We didn't do that but we did go to modern margarita a few weeks after birth only to find it off the menu :(

The tacos are delicious. I love their guac. $6 for three tacos during happy hour is really not that bad of a deal.

\"Please bring back the yoga."}
{"text":"I have heard some cool things about the Modern margarita, but you know.. it really didn't impress me. Maybe I am too blame because I sat outside and maybe that was the mistake, because many didn't want to sit outside, and the wait staff sure didn't want to go outside either. With that being said, the service wasn't bad. I have no problem with it. 

The food. 
For being a Mexican fusion place (which is what I assume they are going for) it really isn't much fusion at all. It is actually fairly basic, and if i want basic Mexican food I go straight to the source and I pay basic Mexican cuisine prices. So here I wasn't impressed either. 

As the sun set, it became really cozy out on the patio. With the lighting and the very open space, I could dig it.. but that isn't why I would go all the way up northern Phoenix to do a patio-hang. If that is my desire there is way better places down town to do this. 

Modern Margarita, I will give you one more chance soon. But that's it. Impress me. And I hope you are ready to bring out the fever-dream mule-kick margarita then."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, but a really small margarita for $9. The 16oz is an even worse deal for $14"}
{"text":"I have eaten here because I work on High Street. Both times I have gotten food to go. The decor is pretty and the front door is huge!! It's a huge glass hinge door! 
The bar is a majority of the space and it's polished. One day I need to get here for drinks at happy hour. Now on to my meals. 
The first time I got the green chile cheeseburger with fries. It was good. I just wanted a tasty burger. And I got what I wanted. 
The second time I got the pork street tacos and chicken nachos. They packaged the nachos components separately to prevent sogginess, which I appreciated. I liked the tacos. I got a choice of flour or corn tortilla or even lettuce if I was so inclined. I got 3 street tacos separately wrapped by paper. Again, consideration of the to go aspect. All in all it was a good meal. This place is consistently good. I like to eat lunch here for food, price and quality compared to the rest of the block. The bartenders are who I mostly deal with. Always friendly."}
{"text":"I can usually tell the quality of a Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa and they did not disappoint here! On a rainy Tuesday for lunch, seating was a little limited as the patio is not covered but my party of seven sat at the bar and received good service. The shrimp tacos as well as the beans and rice were amazingly unique as well as the guacamole and queso dip. Looking forward to exploring their additional menu offerings..."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day. Food was great, service was great as well. Only complaint is the prices of drinks when it's not happy hour. I really didn't want to spend $10 ($11 when I saw the bill) on a margarita and probably wouldn't have if it weren't for starting my vacation. That's kinda pricey in my opinion. There wasn't a lunch menu either and if a place wants to survive the daytimes, maybe it's something to think about? I wanted to try the meal and not just the tacos but considering I already had a $30 bill started, I opted for just the plain tacos.  Also, I understand \"charging\" for the first cup of salsa for cost and inventory reasons (when you've been a server) and then discounting it at the bottom of the check, but for the regular person it's just confusing. Our server even said that everyone complains about it. I will definitely go back when it's happy hour but probably not during regular hours."}
{"text":"Lots of margarita's to choose from, and all are quite strong. They also have lots of other drinks to choose from and their happy hour even on the weekends was awesome. We ordered tacos and nachos that were spicy and tasty- the nacho's needed more cheese and we had to try to mix it as all the topping were only on the top handful of chips, they need to learn how to layer. 

Some of the happy hour snacks were interesting, the steak tostada's almost tasted like a caesar salad piled in a ice cream cone scoop on the tostada shell. It was tasty but a bit strange. However, it was great to see that for five bucks on the happy hour menu you get two of them, for six bucks you can get 3 tasty tacos. 

One thing that impressed me was the service, the place was packed and out table of ten eventually became a table of twenty, the waitress was obviously surprised but she remembered everyone's name, drink order and made getting separate checks a piece for cake. 

I will definitely go back and am excited to try more margaritas."}
{"text":"I love Modern Margarita!  I stumbled upon this gem on High Street looking for a new place to eat.  I have two words: fish tacos.  I cant describe how good they are, you just have to try them.  Every day of the week they have different specials and the tostadas are also great from the appetizers menu.  Unfortunately they dont allow dogs and I would normally take away a star for that but that's how great this place is.  it's a little bit trendy at night so if you're into that then great.  If you prefer a more relaxed atmosphere I'd say come in the day time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local hang out for lunch and dinner! Great chips and salsa and tacos... Ummmmmmm"}
{"text":"Giving this 3 stars for the service. Bartender Derek was fsntastic. Steak skewers were bland and dry, steak tosdadas were all salad with miniscule pieces of the bland dry steak. Margaritas are yummy and the salsa Verde is awesome. Lovely atmosphere, music a bit too loud. I would come back for drinks and salsa. Onion rings and steak fries very good especially the spiked catsup."}
{"text":"My wife, brother in law and mother in law took me out to Modern Margarita for my birthday, and we had an awesome time! While I agree with the other reviews that the service is a little slow, our waitress was super nice and we didn't lack anything as far as service! We all enjoyed our drinks however the blended margarita's were super sweet so watch out for that! My wife and I absolutely loved the pork taco's, and I like the choice of corn or flour tortillas as I don't really love soft corn ones but most places don't give an option so I usually just suffer through them so it was nice to have what I like best. The chicken taco however was bland, and definitely needed some seasoning to make it up to par with the really tasty pork tacos. We also really loved the queso, but it needed more beer flavor to really be beer queso. All in all it was an awesome night and we had a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos, that's all I have to say!  The best!  And love their skinny margaritas.   So fresh and perfectly made.  Service was decent but nothing to rave about hence the 3 stars vs 4.  Good little place for some tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"The server had a bad attitude from the moment we walked in, as if it was an inconvenience that we were there ( and it wasn't close to closing time.) It was my second time in and it was the last time."}
{"text":"Great patio to hang out and enjoy the Arizona cool nights. Server was very accommodating to turning up the heaters. 

House margarita and Rustic margarita were very good. Only negative about the drink: glass is small and full of ice. Best to go on Monday night when they are only $5.  

Carna Asada and chicken tacos were good. 

Ladies please take note.....bathroom is for one person. If you go as a group you will have to stand outside the door. There is a \"troth\" for men and women to use. Very awkward. 

Great place for a date, casual dinner, or meeting co-workers."}
{"text":"I probably won't ever come back here again. The wait staff is seriously so uninterested. No genuine smiles and no sense of urgency. They have changed the salsa flight and got rid the chipotle salsa for 2 massive things of salsa and/or cheese and I literally don't even want to order anything else. Literally over this place. After enough below average experiences, just done with this place. It's too bad. Literally."}
{"text":"Went to Modern Margarita to watch the ASU game at the beginning of the month. The best part of our experience was the bartender who educated me and my family on the different types of tequila they carry. Other than that this bar had a very \"Dos Gringos\" vibe. The food comes in smaller sizes and they are \"OK\". Wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"We were out celebrating a birthday on Saturday nite. Our party of 8 turned into 20. I have to give a shout out to our server, Lindsey. She was very nice, efficient and never complained or showed stress any time someone new arrived. She worked her butt off and kept a smile all the while. If you stop by, I hope you get to meet her, she was awesome!

Aside from that, food was delicious. Drinks were unbelievable. We had The Conquistador. Best drink on the menu hands down. And the DJ was on point! 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Modern Margarita is close to home, so for that alone, this spot has me due to its connivence. I've been a couple times now and think the food is pretty solid, but not phenomenal. The tacos each have a unique twist, not traditional per say, and personally I think the chips are excellent. They are hot and fresh, just the way I like them. The carne asada tacos are my favorite and the margaritas I have had are quite good... they have a great kick, they are not stingy on the alcohol, which I appreciate, especially for the price.

The restaurant itself isn't huge, but has a nice outside patio and the inside is really nice as well with a big bar. The staff has always been friendly and accommodating so Modern Margarita gets high points there. Happy Hour specials are great as well!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed after today's visit. We came in for lunch and ordered Nachos, three tacos- carne, special, and pork, and garlic steak fries. When the order came out, they brought Nachos and 2 tacos- carne and mahi mahi. When we spoke to the server, he apologized. We repeated the taco order. He came back with the special, then a couple minutes later with a veggie taco and fries. We asked for the server again, rexplained the order and he finally brought the pork taco.  The fries were not garlic, when we asked the girl bringing the food, she said that its a garlic aoili- which had NOT been put on our fries. To top it off it off, the pork on the nachos qas VERY fatty. This was our 3rd visit, and while our server Luis was personable, he could not get the order straight even after multiple reclarifications. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I already thought this place was overpriced and over hyped.. but this last time was the tie breaker. I came in with a girlfriend right before happy hour ended and all they had available was the \"community\" table which was by the restrooms and had 10 high top seats. After an hour of many overpriced margs and food, the hostess came up to us and told us to leave and to move outside. We all had full drinks we just reordered and had not paid our bills. It was 8:02. And the hostess told us the 8:15 reservation was here for this table so we had to move. I have never in my life been asked to be moved to a new table because a reservation was here early. We asked for the manager and all she said was that we could be moved to the bar tops when there was still a booth available inside. We will never be going back here and will tell all of our friends to never go here either. Worst customer service I've ever heard of in my life, and I've been in the industry my whole life."}
{"text":"BLAH!!!  Margaritas served in a small martini style glass, soooooooo full of ice that it is about 3 sips and it's gone. Nachos served in the chip container with a \"splash of cheese\" on top and pico de gallo the rest was dry as SH*T. The chips were wet from the pico de gallo they put all over the top. Yuck!  The only thing that is normal is the beer. Save your money."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour the other day. I really liked the other Modern mexican place down on Mill but this one didn't have the same feel even though the decor was very similar. I had the chips and salsa flight for $3 and the chips were rather tasty and the salsas were pretty good but I could have used some spice. The happy hour beer deal wasn't great, $3 domestics, $4 mexican beers and craft domestics and $5 for imports. The patio looked nice but gets nailed by the sun in the afternoon and can be hot even with the misting system. Wasn't a fan of the fairly loud lounge electronic music, the interior has so many hard surfaces it can get rather loud. I stayed for a beer and chips but walked across the street to Blue Martini for a much more fun setting with better happy hour deals. Service was a bit spotty. I am not sure that I would go back, perhaps I will give it another shot when it's not summer time."}
{"text":"The chicken street tacos were really tasty and the atmosphere is super trendy and fun. The only reason not 5 stars is because it is pricey and the service was meh... Not very inviting or friendly.  I will be back for the food tho!"}
{"text":"Ow on the other hand this place really not that great for everything sorry  
Not recommended."}
{"text":"Good food and nice patio.  And they are great with kids! Very relaxing with a great fire table!"}
{"text":"This place has great happy hour specials. I love the frozen margarita with chambord and the queso dip is delicious. There is a decent amount of seating inside and a nice patio as well. The bartenders are friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I was in love with Canteen Modern Tequila Bar on Mill Ave. When Julian decided to close her down I was sad at first. I heard that he was taking the concept to the next level and Modern Margarita was born. It has all the class and sass of the concept with cleaner lines, a less students and a whole lot more class. The Food is great, I'm in love with the Trio of Sala's, and warm fried chips. The Pipil Tacos were super tasty, with just the right flavor pineapple and chipotle slaw. So Good! If you looking for one of the best Tequila Selections in town, mixed with the some of the best Vibes around. Check out The Modern Margarita."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to try something different up north here.  I may return for happy hour but she certainly wouldn't. 

The vibe was cool. Music was really loud, but it was a Friday night so I get if they were trying to keep up with Blue Martini across the way. I was surprised at how busy it was when I walked in but then excited about the people watching. It's a neat, small space. 

The host was great. Very friendly and helpful. 

I finally found a couple of seats at the bar and ordered a couple of the specialty drinks on the menu when I girlfriend arrived. She got the yoga marg and I got some blanco drink with grapefruit. The drinks were tasty, but the bartender was saltier than the rim of my glass. We immediately were taken back by her passiveness and abrupt responses to our questions about the menu. (Which consisted of one question- street tacos are three to an order. Do we pick three or is it three of the same). 

Anyhow, my girlfriend had a shard of glass shoot through her straw into her mouth. Not upset about it, it happens. I worked in the industry for years so hey, you burn the ice, make new drinks and apologize. No such luck. We told the bar back, he alerted the bartender, she got irritated. He had to convince to to make a new drink. She made hers, set it down and walked away. No apology, no words even. I grabbed the bar back and said, \"I hate to be a pain in the a*$ but the waters and my drink came from the same well. We need these remade too if you could. \". He was totally on board but this irritated her further. She made the drinks and never burned a well. I asked her if the drinks came from the same one and her response, three times, was, \"I promise... You're good.\"  Never, it came from a different well; im sorry that happened; let me check; is your friend ok... After twenty minutes I grabbed a manager to let her know that there was ice in one of the wells because I watched to see neither get burned and somebody was going to end up chewing on more glass. The manager immediately dealt with the bar and we never saw our bartender again.  Until she threw the check down. 

I'll give credit on the place, the food was ok and the atmosphere made up for it. That bartender though made us never want to go back. Before any of this happened, we had tried to make up an excuse to sit on the other end of the bar to avoid her attitude.  

I've been in the industry for a long time and have had yelp reviews written about me. Some good. Some bad. You can't win em all. You can, however, be nice to people, even when you're busy, and let the chips fall where they may.  Unfortunately she chose to play her cards horribly.  Owners, talk to your girl and make a real smile a requirement."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night tonight. The atmosphere is fun and drinks are good. However, I wouldn't say the food is anything great. We ordered nachos and a couple tacos. The tacos were so so and our nachos were super cold to the point where I had to ask our server if that's how they were suppose to be. Our server said that sometimes they come out like that, but no that's not how they are suppose to be so she corrected them with giving us hot queso. If we come back will probably skip food and just have some drinks."}
{"text":"MM delivers on trendy dinning and great margaritas.  The place feels more like a bar than a restaurant, but don't let that fool you.  The food is great.  I had the pork tacos which comes with pineapple, guacamole, and a mix of cilantro-onion-cabbage.  You can get the tacos with your choice of flour, corn tortilla or lettuce wrap.  I also had a chicken taco.  

I am doing #NSNG, but cheated a little with a watermelon margarita.  It was well worth the splurge.  No doubt they know their margaritas.  The service was a little business-like, but it was a busy Saturday night.  It was very good, not necessarily friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but was not a traditional restaurant!!! More like eating dinner in a super loud nightclub! Extremely loud, you won't be able to even hear conversation from someone sitting next to you. Seating is booths as well. But tacos were delicious and fresh, lots of veggie options."}
{"text":"Cute and quaint mexican restaurant. Very upscale and modern in a new development close to the JW resort. 

Prices were great, bean dip delicious and tasty food. Tacos and steak tostada were my fav! Delicious home made chips and spectacular decor.

If I was lived around here, I would be back for more. Very sweet staff, manager on hand asking how everything was .  Most importantly, I thought the price was right!"}
{"text":"Other than being extremely busy on a Saturday night before Halloween, this place was great. We walked in, had a nice table and proceeded to check over the menu. We ordered a couple drinks, and the dip duo. We had guacamole and bean dip. Fantastic!!! Simple, quick, and fun. They had an amazing playlist going as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great friendly place to meet people. Really Happening! Super Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"If you like crappy margaritas, and poor service, this place is NOT for you.....one of the best margaritas I have ever had. The service was beyond stellar...I will be back more than once before I leave....
Props to a great new place, truly hope you are around for a long time."}
{"text":"It's a cool place and definitely a nice upgrade for downtown Chandler. However, charging $19 for a decent margarita is absurd (you can get the cheap ones for only $10). I'd continue to go back once they realize it's Chandler not Vegas. Carne asada tacos were good but nothing that will blow your socks off either. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fun people all around. Beautiful and fun customers and staff. Margaritas are exquisite. They give a complimentary bucket of chips and salsa. The salsa is house made. The salsa has good flavor and spice."}
{"text":"Went for first time tonight, will be back. Shared guacamole and queso for starter. We also had carne asada and pork tacos both delicious. Very cool atmosphere, music a bit loud. Good place for a date. Very good service too by Yohanis (?) High street is nice to walk around after dinner too."}
{"text":"There for Taco Tuesday.... This review is on bar service....one of the Bartenders was so completely rude to more than 1 person.  I've been in several times, and he seems to always think highly of himself, and his drinks aren't even that  great.  I bartended myself and was in the service industry when I was younger.  I'm a local business owner and have restaurants in San Diego.  He would never work for us. He called a customer a B#$%H and I was disgusted by his attitude. He claims he is owner  or top management. What an imbecile. I may not come back just because of him...he berades his co workers to customers as well. His pours are over, and as a business owner that should be a concern. Rick or Rich is his name , not sure which, but he gets no respect from me or anyone else that was there that evening."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday for happy hour and enjoyed it.  It shares a kitchen with another restaurant which fronts Boston.   The entrance to MM is on Arizona Ave.
We had a great server who was prompt & attentive without being intrusive.  The happy hour prices are so-so but the food was excellent.  We had the fish tacos on flour tortillas and they were ample and outstanding taste.  Two thumbs up on them.
We are not big margarita fans but their wines were great. The interior seating is limited as is the outdoor seating.  
The only drawback is the proximity to Arizona Ave.  AA has a high volume of cars & the traffic light results in quite a few vehicles stopped just a few paces from you.   Translate: exhaust fumes galore.
That said, the service and food is great.  We will return."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for a while now and food and vibe is nice. We started ordering the Surf And Turf. You get All types of ingredients that go in your taco and you build it yourself. You get about 8 shrimp pieces and lots of carne asada."}
{"text":"Very stingy on Taco Tuesday. They only offer you three choices of tacos and force you to purchase three at once. The chicken they use is dark and white meat - an obvious sign of throwing the public the scraps left over for taco Tuesday. The chips and salsa were free, but both were so salt laden that only a handful of chips could be ingested. We ended up just having a few drinks and heading elsewhere to dine. The menu is mostly tacos, appetizers and salads. Patio and bar are still heated and this is probably a good place for drinking on Monday and all day sunday happy hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!!   Have been here twice with about a group of 10 or more and each time was fantastik!!!  Our waiters were very friendly and ON TOP of it everytime!!  The manager, Brent, was also very involved in making sure we had a GREAT time!  Even though one of our peeps was a little sad they didnt offer dessert, Brent did NOT disappoint!!!!  . 

Along with their great staff, they have wonderful food too!!!!  Their chips and guacamole are sooo tasty and the tacos are a must try!!!  Oh, and you cant beat all day happy hour on sundays!!!!   Thank you for making it a great night!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. The food was pretty decent. Serve not so much. Ordered a dip duo of queso and guacamole. The queso is tasty but begins to harden almost immediately and becomes too thick to even use as a dip. Tried several different margaritas, some frozen, some on the rocks, and we weren't super impressed with any of them. Especially for a tequila bar. The tacos were good, had them a la carte so I can't speak to the rice and beans. Now on to the service, the bartender was less than friendly. Couldn't really offer any opinion on the drinks, never came and checked on us for drinks or food, we had to flag him down for EVERYTHING. And most of the time we were the only two people at the bar. It wasn't even busy. I can see why."}
{"text":"Will never come here again. Far too many loud mouthed drunks which make it totally impossible. Chips and salsa good and waiting for food. If hadn't already ordered would leave. totally ridiculous
 NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"good tacos but beyond ridiculously priced cocktails and we live in downtown chicago.   margarita and wine might have worked if it was a tasting portion.   Manager responded that the wines are 5 oz pours and that is their policy.   Nice 5 ounce poor for a full glass price.  Also - had one band of gin in the entire bar (i realize it is a mexican restaurant but one well gin?)."}
{"text":"Went there with some friends, everyone was on a separate tab. They charged my card not only for my tab but someone else's. We brought this to their attention not once, twice but at least three maybe four times and they told us every time that our card would be credited. NEVER WAS! Finally after two weeks of this we had to dispute the charge with the bank. It's hard not to believe they were doing this on purpose assuming the other persons bill would not be paid. They figure run it on someone else's card, maybe they won't find out, bad business! 
It's safe to say my wife and I will never go back. And if any of our friends suggest another party there we'll share this story first."}
{"text":"Great service, nice ambiance.  Really enjoyed the mahi mahi tacos and the Corona Light on tap.  I wish they had a Mexican Bulldog (a margarita with a Corona in it) on the drinks menu.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food at great prices. We caught some of the happy hour specials and ordered steak skewers, steak fries and guacamole with chips. We also, on the recommendation of our server ordered two yummy margaritas. Despite being super busy we were seated immediately and felt well taken care of by our server. He was attentive and friendly. After our apps we ordered tier pork and fish tacos- YUM! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Based on the mixed reviews by other Yelpers, I knew my experience would be a gamble. And sure enough, my experience at MM was eh, just ok. 

All started well. My two friends and I were greeted and promptly seated in a booth. The decor is really modern and the booth was comfy. The perfect size for chatting with friends...if you can hear them!! The music is SO loud that we all noticed it. We had to yell to be heard. Some songs were louder than others and it became unbearable. Finally, we asked them to turn it down and they did. Whew!! 

Now for the food. Ordered the salsa flight, guacamole, vegetarian tostadas, chicken skewers and steak skewers to share. I wondered if the tortilla chips were from the bottom of a bag. Half of the basket consisted of small, broken chips. No bueno! 
The salsa trio was great. I particularly enjoyed the salsa verde. The guacamole was average. The chicken and steak skewers were really delicious and the sauces that accompanied them were very nice touches. Vegetarian tostadas were fantastic and very flavorful! 

I ordered one wine and one Mexican beer. Can't go wrong there. 

Service: our server was friendly but she wasn't consistent in asking us if we enjoyed our food or if we needed anything. Had to ask someone else to bring the bill and after 15 minutes of waiting for her to pick it up, I got up to walk it to the bar to cash out. 

Verdict: their happy hour makes it worth going back but I won't expect much else."}
{"text":"I frequent Modern Margarita weekly. It's a very nice addition to City North and the Desert Ridge neighborhood. They have a great ambiance going on inside and I love their patio--best misters around here. 


Guacamole-legit
Salsa Flight- good with unique & smoky flavor
Tacos - I've had the carne asada, pork & shrimp, all have been superb. 

Drinks- you'll find any tequila you could think of behind the bar. Their mojitos are excellent and one of the female bartenders makes an outstanding mojito with a pineapple twist (can't remember her name). 

Moscow Mule- reason enough to head to Modern Margarita. THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE ONE. And it is served in the traditional tin mug!-- a concept most phoenix bars can't quite grasp. 

Last thing, Sunday is all day happy hour. What's not to love here?"}
{"text":"Pros- Great ambiance and decor, love the patio and booths. Pretty good happy hour prices for drinks and appetizers.  I ordered shrimp tacos and they were delicious! 

Cons- Inexperienced servers and bussers, we had a busser approach our table with a gray bucket, he then proceeded to scrape our finished plates across the table dumping them in the bucket. Sort of made me feel like I was in the school cafeteria. Also, rather small portions, if you're a dude you'll probably want to get 2 orders of tacos. 

This place definitely has great potential after they iron out the kinks!"}
{"text":"I chose to stop here on my birthday for some drinks and dips, because honestly, who can go a full birthday without some salsa and a marg? Anyway, I just wanted to confirm that this place still has such great service and good food. Our server was attentive, knowledgable and not at all irritated that we really were just there for a drink and some snacks. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Extra charges added to our bill without any warning:  I had asked our server if they had a spicier salsa that came with the chips/salsa appetizer.  The server brought out a very small bowl of mildly spicier salsa--nothing special.  He never mentioned there was an extra charge, but $2 was added to our tab.  How dirty!  How many Mexican joints charge for tiny bowls of \"spicier\" salsa (it was barely spicier)?  What douches!  There's far better food elsewhere.  Very disappointing and deceptive.  This business is out to cheat you!  Or at least they hire greedy servers who want to cheat you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Love the decor here.  Excellent Margs and the tacos are good too!  Nice outdoor patio.  Relaxed vibe with good music playing.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is for the parking which sucks."}
{"text":"Service was lackluster we had to repeatedly tell the waiter to refill our drinks. We went on a busy Saturday night which I can understand the lack of attention but in this case it was a bit excessive. The tacos were ok. Way over priced for what you get. I got the fish fried tacos which can be a bit spicy but had good flavor. Their patio is nice, specially this time of the year. The menu is lacking a bit with not a lot to choose from but over all the tacos were not bad."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but they ruined the restaurant with the new menu.  Everything is a la cart, prices went up 20-25%, and no substitutions?!?  Nice knowing you."}
{"text":"1st timer. Came here as a friend took us to this part of town after WM PGA golf tourney. I was impressed and we showed up at happy hour times, even on a Sat. Greta happy hour and food. Nice service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Modern Margarita has a very cool vibe to it with a beautiful interior and relaxing large outdoor patio. It's a good place to grab a drink and some chips & guac, but not really great as a dining destination. The menu is small and there is all of one vegetarian entree choice. I ordered the veggie street tacos, and they were fine. Nothing really spectacular but not terrible either. The size of one order of tacos ($7) is too small to make a lunch, so you will need to order chips & salsa ($6) and/or chips & guacamole ($6). The salsas are just okay - we got the trio to try them all and the pico and tomatillo were a little bland. The chipotle roasted was yummy. The negative with our $6 order is that each salsa comes in a tiny little dish and though you get free refills, our service wasn't fantastic and it took a good amount of time. The guacamole is good. For being such a fancy place, it's so strange that when you order water it's the really nasty Phoenix hard-metal tasting water. Someone forgot to install a filter.

I would return here for happy hour to have a drink and some chips out on the patio, but don't plan on having entire meals here."}
{"text":"First, the service was great. Our server Nick was very helpful and friendly from the start. He made the experience fun. Food was pretty good too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ummmm can we say Nick & Nate!?!? Best bartenders in the land!!! My roommate and I are new into town and we've never felt more welcome at a new spot! This place is legit! Happy hour is awesome too! Come party :)"}
{"text":"Worst \"Mexican food\" restaurant ever. We got here late expecting to get chips and salsa and beers.... they said \"we don't have any limes\" and \"we can give you chips, but no salsa\".... wtf? This is lame and not cool for a couple of people wanting salsa. FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"I came in Sunday Night to try modern margarita and order some food to go. I ordered chips, queso and salsa to go and a chicken quesadilla. I also ordered a margarita while waiting for my food. They informed me they had no chips for the salsa and and queso which is extremely odd considering it is a Mexican restaurant. I then asked if they can just throw in a few tortillas because I have no Chips for the salsa and queso. The bartender informed me that there few dollar charge for tortillas and I said that's not right because I have no chips and I am paying full price for the salsa and queso. The kitchen manager then came over and said there would be an extra charge and would do nothing about it. I was very insulted not because of the extra charge but the way he approached me and handled the situation over tortillas. I had to stop at the circle K next door to buy Tostitos so I could have chips with my salsa and queso. Also  the girl next to me wanted to order mahi Mahi tacos and they said they were out of that also and she left. When you open a restaurant it's understandable that there is going to be hiccups but you do not treat brand new customers that way. On a positive note I would give the bartenders that were working and bar manager 5 stars, they were incredible and nice and made the best margaritas."}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us arrived about 9 for dinner and margaritas.  It was so-so.  We will not go back.  Drinks were the positive here.  The margaritas are petite sized, but at least they were tasty.  Chips were good, too.  Tacos, burritos, and quesadillas were ordered by everyone in our group.  Food was bland, mushy, and just poorly executed. Quesadilla was only cooked on one side and filled with mushy too sweet pork.  Worst ever!  Tacos were bland and boring.  We ordered the bean dip. My friend said it tasted sooty. Yep."}
{"text":"The skinny... the street tacos are AMAZING and the bartenders are very friendly and attentive. Great happy hour for a quick stop in the afternoon!  Love Love Love the atmosphere. Open air.  Not your usual Mexican restaurant.  Tequila with a twist! We enjoy the experience and will always come back."}
{"text":"Was in town again for work had some time before we were leaving so we decided to hit up this super cute spot for happy hour. Had been here before so was a little excited to have their taco flight. 

The taco flight is definitely enough to share. 3 of each (chicken, veggie, carne asada, pork and fish) taco for a total of 15 tacos!! My favorite are the fish tacos topped with red lettuce and topped with their pico de hallo, amaaaazing!!! The carne asada tacos are filled with meat, definitely hearty.

I also enjoyed a hot mango margarita. Like spice and tequila, this is a must try! 

Our server Yohanis was attentive and touched our table just enough for us to not feel negelected. He was on point and definitely defined great customer service! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and chowed down on a bucket (literally a large bucket) of chips and salsa. I couldn't believe we were the only ones at the bar eating the free chips! I had two seltzer waters and my boyfriend had a beer. Our tab came to $6 on a Saturday night! How great is that?

We've been here many times and had all of the tacos with the fish being my favorite. They have quite a few vegetarian options that are easily modifiable to be vegan. Their happy hour is fantastic, you've got to try the nachos or the dip duo. 

This was always our favorite place for Sunday Funday because of all-day happy hour, but I can't recall how many TVs they have or if we just popped in here for a drink. Taco Tuesday is a killer deal. 

TIP: Their skinny margarita and yogi marg are insanely delicious for low-calorie drinks. I love the pop of soda water on top to give it a little carbonation. 

They're open late and serve food all night long, which makes getting a late bite to eat very easy!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  We used to love it!  New Happy Hour menu is lots of unhealthy fare and tacos used to be 2-3 for a few bucks. Now it's one pathetic disc about the 1/3 of the size of a normal tortilla. Don't know when these changes happened. Not going back. What a shame."}
{"text":"Had a blast with my sisters at Modern Margarita. Wally had great suggestions and made excellent drinks! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm rounding up because I had a really good time.  The place is very nice, I like the patio, this is the same location were the coffee shop used to be.  We were a group of 17 women, so you can imagine our poor server was a little overwhelmed.  I had the steak skewers and those were amazing, the chimichurri sauce was great.  Very similar to the one I had in Argentina several years ago.  I was not in the mood for a margarita, but most of my friends had several, they look good and my friends said it was tasty.  I will definitely come back to try other items, and my steak skewers."}
{"text":"I wish I was \"wasted away again in Margaritaville\"... Not that I was wasted after going here, but it sure would've been easy to get there! The margaritas are so good, they go down so smooth -- if you don't watch how much you drink, next thing you know, BAM! you're wasted in Margaritaville. 

I didn't really eat anything besides the chips, guac, and salsa, but those were phenomenal! The menu looked extremely appetizing, and I'll be back to try some of the items on their menu. 

The atmosphere and ambiance is great too! The setup is very chic, modern, and inviting -- like a place to just hang out and enjoy the company of the ones you're there with. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place. It was a disappointment . It is very loud, overpriced and food is just ok. The salsa they give you with the chips is overpowered with cumin.  They way they handle table service is not user friendly.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed when I tried this place for the first time (3 p.m. on a Sunday). My boyfriend and I live near by and we decided to give this place a whirl since we already have our usual Mexican  places, we wanted to try some place new. We walked in to a full bar, but we snagged the last 2 seats on the corner, so we were pretty excited. It took the bartender about 12 minutes to get to us. He was nice, but just not very good. He asked us if anyone had been by to help us and we said no, but the funny thing is that there were no other bartenders there lol maybe it was shift change? None the less a slow start. The margaritas were mediocre at best. My frozen mango margarita was half mango puree, literally half. I thought it might just be mine but the girl next to me got a strawberry I believe and it was the same thing, ALOT of puree. My boyfriend's was on the rocks, super sour, and weak. I'm not a huge tequila lover, so if I'm saying it was weak then chances are..

We put our order in with the first bartender, but by the time our food arrived there was a different guy on. He seemed more on his game, a little more experienced. Same comment with the food, mediocre. The guac was lack-luster, good salsa though. The steak and chicken tacos were pretty ok. They give you a lot of meat which is a bonus so it's worth the money.  All in all the service needs some work, but it has potential. Even a friendly smile from anyone in there would have made the experience a little nicer."}
{"text":"The carne was fantastic - super tender and flavorful.  Tacos were yummy but a little over priced for the street taco size. Our waiter was very friendly and walked us through the menu. I decided to try a margarita (happy hour all day on Sunday) - Not super strong but good taste. 
We will be back again for more carne and maybe try to take down a huge marg"}
{"text":"Fresh food. Light (calorie wise and health) Mexican. Great atmosphere.  Great service"}
{"text":"Spend time there several times, even bought some Groupons, but lately the wait staff is not very attentive. You have to ask for refills and no name introduction or real eye contact. Drinks are good...Chris the bartender is the exception as he actually talks to you and makes great drinks."}
{"text":"Once again Modern Margarita and Brent hit it out of the park for our big group. This was our 2nd time going on Sunday for the all day Happy Hour. The food and service was fantastic and no delay. I tried the new Steak Tostada and i can say that i wanted it again the next day. Great flavor lots of meat. My favortie margarita is the honey watermelon with sugar trim. Chips, salsa and guacamole made the rounds and was fresh."}
{"text":"That was some of the best food and drinks we have had from a traditional Mexican restaurant/bar. The OG Margarita was not only exceptionally tasty but crafted at the highest level of mixing from our bartender Carlos. We also received top quality service from Carlos and every other employee that we encountered. One employee even filled up our water cup as she walking off shift. Highly recommend the food, drinks, and service to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and while visiting Phoenix for work, myself and five of my coworkers decided to stop in for a few drinks and some food after searching yelp for Mexican food close by to our hotel. The atmosphere was relaxed and the salsa and burritos definitely hit the spot and did not disappoint. They have a good selection of beer and cocktails and if I lived in the area I could certainly see myself and my friends making  this place one of our usual  lunch/dinner/drink spots. I would like to say that beside the food and drinks being good, our server Kelsey was absolutely amazing! She not only took care of our food and drink needs wonderfully, she made our experience at MM extra entertaining with her amazing energy and personality. Thank you Kelsey! We will be back next time we are in town for sure!"}
{"text":"Flight of tacos is great! Good drinks and a great outdoor patio. I'm used to Mexican in the Nottheast so this seems authentic and was very tasty. I will come back when in Scottsdale again. The service was great and everyone enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Living across the street from City North I've been anxiously waiting for MM to open.  We went a few nights ago for dinner and I have to say it didn't live up to our expectations.  The patio and atmosphere is beautiful.. give that 5 stars!  But the food and overall experience was just ok.  We asked to mix our tacos since they give you 3, can we have 2 steak and 1 pork but they said it's not allowed. Funny since we offered to pay the higher price and just sub 1 of them for pork, but i guess they couldn't do it.  Seems like it would be pretty easy to do and other restaurants usually have no problem with that.  Anyways, the carne asada tacos were good but a little light on the meat.  Salsa was ok but was lacking spice.  We also ordered the guacamole which we did enjoy.  The salsa flight was nice to be able to sample everything but again they were all mild and lacked alot of flavor.  My friend ordered the chicken tacos and only ate 2 as she didn't care for the flavor. 

We were hoping for dessert but they said they don't have a dessert menu.  Hopefully this is something that is coming soon.  

Service was ok but I know it's new so we figure they are still getting used to running the place.  They looked short staffed so our waitress wasn't on top of things like we would expect.  She also asked if we wanted our bill when we still had full drinks at the table.  Felt a little rushed like she was trying to clear us out.  

We will give this place another shot and try another item off the menu since the tacos weren't the best.  But i'm really hoping it gets better as it's a beautiful place and perfect location for us to walk over for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place was not good. Went for lunch on a Thursday and service was super slow, (which is weird because it wasn't even close to being 
 busy) and terrible food and margs. Not sure if I just came on an off day or what. Their chicken taco was so dry I couldn't even eat the chicken I had to take it off. Margarita tasted watered down. Just not sure what's going on here but I'm not impressed and definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Just tried to stop in for a bite with the family. With no other seating options available for our group of five, we attempted to sit at a long empty table in the rear of the patio.

Unfortunately, the server rudely informed us that the table was reserved at 6pm for a party of 24 and that they didn't want to rush us. Very nice of you not to rush us, but it was 3:55pm and we would have been long gone by 5:30pm. Then she simply walked back to her station and made no offer to accommodate us elsewhere in the restaurant. Handled horribly.

We are currently enjoying much better service at a neighboring restaurant. We frequent the area but we'll be sure to avoid the attitude here."}
{"text":"Came here with vendors and got the 15 taco platter and some appetizers. I enjoyed all the veggies in the vegetarian tacos but flavor was just \"meh\".  The atmosphere is hip and the service was good. 

This place is good, but overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is the location and looks.  There was definitely time and money spent on making this feel like a cool place.  So, if you are just looking to go to a cool place in the area, you won't be disappointed.  If you are interested in spending your money on food and service also, read on...

The service here seems to fit a disappointing trend of \"cool\" restaurants.  Staff is very interactive with each other, and not so much with the customers.  Food knowledge is lacking and it feels like bartenders and waiters feel like they are entitled to your 20% tip and trying to figure out if your going to give it to them right away.  

The food is overpriced and nothing special.  Amount of protein in about every dish is small, clearly to increase profit margin.  Expensive chips and salsas that you pay more for because you get 3 average salsas instead of 1.  I've actually been here for happy hour several times, and the most memorable part is the bill at the end... thinking it really wasn't worth that much.

If you're looking for great Mexican food, there are many better options.  If a cool restaurant makes the food and service seem incredible, then you will like this place."}
{"text":"Just went to Modern Margarita's VIP party last night and had a wonderful time. The décor is contemporary and the patio is fantastic! The first thing that you notice when you walk in is the open bar which has seating all around from the inside and outside patio creating a seamless transition from indoor to outdoor. We were able to sample the Modern, Sonoran, Yoga and Spicy Mango margaritas as well as a variety of their menu items. The Modern Margarita is the classic, the Sonoran fruitier, the Yoga (Skinny Girl) a play on the classic with Triple Sec and Seltzer to give it some bubbles and the Spicy Mango is definitely what it says it is! My personal favorite was the Yoga.  

The food consists of some of the best chips, salsa and guacamole I have ever had as well as an assortment of street tacos, small plates and burgers. We had the pork and chicken street tacos which were equally delicious. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items! Hands down my new favorite ultra-chic margarita mecca."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster for drinks.  The music is that loungy music you would never listen to on your own-  Not techno, just bad loungy music there-  Hate that kind of music.  

If you get a Margarita, its tough to get more than two sips of your own drink.  They use so much ice,  No kidding,   I could drink the margarita in 30 seconds or less.  Everything is pre-made for the most part and there is so little liquor used you feel you are paying for Margarita flavored Kool-Aid for $8.00 at a time.  

They can't screw up a shot of a Tequila and there is a large(and expensive) selection.  I am not a cheap guy, but hate being ripped off.

I hope this review kicks them in the butt a little bit.  I did not try the food but I went to Modern Margarita to have of  course;  a Margarita.   I will be skipping this place in the future.  A good place to meet in front of and then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is chill and has strong margaritas! Double win! Stop by and trade the bartenders with love, they are packers fans!!!"}
{"text":"I saw this on yelp a little while ago, and said why not try it today? Well, I'm glad I did. My girlfriend and I got to restaurant and it was very nice and open. We were greeted in a nice and friendly manner and ordered our food. It was a slower day because our food came out really quick. That's not a bad thing. I had the pork tacos and she had the carne Asada tacos. All we could say was WOW! Those are really good tacos! And I mean really good! The carne Asada tacos were really good! We had like three plates of them. Also it was taco Tuesday:) long story short, if you do go, go on Tuesday for the tacos:)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I ever tasted and the music was horrible.  What a dive."}
{"text":"Come for the drinks but not the food...Stale tasting tacos and the most expensive item on the menu (burger) is subpar + oily fries."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty starters, great margaritas. Sat at the bar outside and it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for happy hour and had great food and service! Katie was our server and she was awesome! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant that only had 2 booths. All other tables inside were high, bar stool tables. Not my favorite. They had the doors open to their patio which is located on Arizona Ave, very noisy on patio and inside restaurant. And that was the good news.

Regular salsa was too heavy with garlic. Chips were cold. Cheese dip was too spicy. Bean dip was too bland. Chef's special tacos were inedible. The carne asada was really bad, and the same awful cheese dig was poured on. The tacos were not good either.

This would be considered a disaster. We will not return. Oh, I forgot...the ice tea was really bad, how do you screw up ice tea?"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, both with friends and as a \"date-night\" with my wife.  I really want to enjoy this place, I really do.  It's just that we have been here about 5 times and something almost always leaves a bit more to be desired. 

The good: They have great margaritas, great happy hour and awesome patio setting.  It is hip to the nines and a great place (if with a group of people) to hang out on the patio with the misters or heaters.  Most of the patio booth style tables will fit 6-8 people so that is a plus.  Their chips and salsa flight is good, not the best but good.  At $3 oh HH it is better.  I would not pay full price for them.  

Their tacos are good, but not consistent.  The first time we went to this place, it was one of the first weeks they were open.  Their shrimp tacos were excellent.  Ever since that trip, I think they changed the type of shrimp; from big and juicy cut up shrimp, to small popcorn shrimp.  I understand the need to decrease food costs, but at least keep the food quality consistent.  They also used to serve the tacos in a \"taco holder\", but the last few times, even when the restaurant was not busy, the tacos have come out on a plate without the holder. The shrimp tacos have been hit or miss for me.  Carne asada, pork, chicken, fried and grilled fish tacos are decent as well.  You get three (although you can not pick which one -you have to get three of one flavor) at a decent price.  They also have Coronoa Light on tap!

The bad: 
Service.  And the primary reason for my 3 stars.  Service can take a while to either greet you or get your drinks.  I am not sure if this is because of the bar or because they are understaffed or just plain busy.  Regardless, it tends to be slow at times.  The last time we were in, it was two of us in the middle of the afternoon and was not busy at all. I will assume one of the employees was a cook and the other was a bartender.  They were talking about how to maximize food costs and how they can easily portion their servings.  An intriguing conversation, yes, but when you mix in conversation about your evening last night, a few F-words loud enough for the dining room to hear, and talking about how drunk you were the night before, it does not leave a good taste in my mouth.  

Now, does this happen every day at this restaurant, probably not.  Was a it a fluke that we were in there at this time, probably so, but these conversations should be had behind closed doors so customers can not hear.  It obviously made an impression on me enough to write it down.  

Above all, a decent restaurant and a viable alternative to the overpriced seafood restaurant at one end of City North and the sushi restaurant at the other end.  I would recommend for HH and maybe small bites.  Food is ok, not bad, but doesn't knock your socks off. Service, eh."}
{"text":"I had the burrito without added meat and it was very good.  We also had a salad and addressing messed up because we can never tasted anything like it. Exceptionally good. I gave it four stars because the margarita prices didn't justify the amount and or quality. It was a small glass pack ice it was almost like having a couple of shooters,   Return most likely only doing happy hour"}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good and the drinks are good, but not $13 a pop good. The crowd here is a little too old for me. There was a very creepy older man (60-70 years old) at the bar obscenely hitting on the waitresses and leering at any woman who walked by, who seemed to be a regular. Also, this place is TINY, I mean a small seating area around a bar and that's it. And don't expect the hostess to help you find a seat. They told us there was no indoor seating but when we looked at the bar there was 10 seats.  When we asked about the bar, they said, oh yeah you can sit there. Then why did you say there was no seating inside?! Just an odd vibe."}
{"text":"This isn't really a restaurant that serves drinks, but a bar that serves snacks. The menu is very limited with mostly overpriced tacos, salads and a few other Mexican fare dishes. The music was SO loud that I could barely hear my lunch mate. We ordered 2 tacos each and they were very small with only one tortilla per taco, which meant they broke and the contents spilled out. Not fun! Now my stomach is churning and grumbling... not a good sign."}
{"text":"I really like Modern Margarita. Good atmosphere, good margaritas and good food. The guacamole and salsa flight are both really tasty. They have happy hour specials which are worth checking out."}
{"text":"This bar is fun and friendly nick is a knowledgeable bartender who is able to walk you through their vast selection of tequilas. Ali is also super friendly and engaging.  This is the place to be for night life. Awesome job you guys truly are the best bartenders on high street"}
{"text":"Modern Margarita is a super fun urban spot in the middle of High Street near desert ridge. The atmosphere is super fun and bright!

Since there was a pretty large group of us, we ordered the tray of 15 tacos. It included everything from fish tacos to veggie tacos to chicken tacos and carnitas. It was suuuper good, and great for the group because there's a little of something for everyone. We also ordered a side of fries with chipotle lime aioli. 

I didn't order any beer or margaritas, but other people at my table ordered some of the local beer and they said it was great! The service was ehh, but I'll cut them some slack because it was a busy Saturday night. 

I went here with a group of 6 people, including 3 small children. While the atmosphere is super fun and loud, I don't think this is the place to bring kids - there's not many options for them and little to keep them entertained unless you brought something from home."}
{"text":"Truly horrible. Six tiny shrimp with a lot of cabbage and no seasoning was a true rip off!"}
{"text":"The bean dip and queso is amazing. But even more impressive was the bartender Larry. I ordered a house Margarita and he offered me a fordeleza tequila instead. I thought he was just trying to run up my bill but it really was the best margarita I have ever had. He was personable even with a ton of people at the bar. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but each time it just falls short. Their food and margaritas are just... ok. Think like Sandbar quality, yet you're paying WAY MORE! This place is just way too overpriced for the quality they serve. This place is okay for a date or out on weekends at night, but definitely not a regular place to visit for a great dinner."}
{"text":"Really knowledgeable and helpful staff.  Heard them giving the full rundown on the menu and their vast selection of Tequilas and margaritas to all the guests.  Decor was modern, hopefully Downtown Chandler decides to support this establishment."}
{"text":"Not the best experience I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. The service was very friendly, though there didn't seem to be a lot of beer knowledge. That's forgivable, as it is a margarita bar by design (and those were good...just had A LOT of ice). As far as the food goes...some of the apps/dips were above average. But, the tacos and tostadas were far from good. Especially the tostadas, which had what seemed like a pound of lettuce on them and very little of anything else. Lastly, the place is a bit cluttered. Overall, it's not a bad place to stop by for drink or two. But I wouldn't recommend for a meal."}
{"text":"My 20 something daughter came to town for a visit so I thought we should try something new in downtown Chandler. I've been wanting to check out MM for some time and thought perfect opportunity, and we were starving so we were really looking forward to a great lunch.

We walked in about 1:00 on a Monday afternoon and there were only 2 couples in the entire place. Should've been my first clue. The sign read PLEASE SEAT YOURSELF... um, okay...so we chose a booth on the far left of the bar. There were no employees anywhere... no one behind the bar, no one at other tables, and so we sat in the booth confused on where the staff was...my daughter got up and played server and brought us our menus. After about 10 minutes someone finally came over and said she didn't see us...well if you were doing your job correctly you would've seen us walk in. 

Chips and salsa are NOT FREE... house salsa $2, the rest $4-6 each or 2 for $10. No refills on salsa. Ordered a pricey margarita filled to the brim with too much ice, was told frozen margarita machine was broken (wth you're a margarita restaurant, that's your signature item duh).  Other things I noticed: extreme limited menu and pricey ( which I get it, it's downtown chandler), wobbly table (hello do you have a handyman to fix that mess), had to get up to get our own appetizer plates for our chips and salsa, had to locate our own salt shaker, had to ask for napkins and utensils. At that point I decided I was not putting out too much more money into this place and drank water and order a $4 taco.  My daughter ordered a burrito with black beans, rice, corn and guacamole and she said it was very good so they get the 2 stars for a decent burrito.  The server stood behind the bar and said \"everything good?\" I just said yep and smh at the lack of customer service. The server seemed like she did not want to be working there, her personality was as dull as a bag of rocks. The whole time we were there, not a soul walked into the place.... we won't be back. I give this place 3 months if they make it that far... it'll be closing soon"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome, they have sweet fans outside that blast cool mist on you when it's a hot summer day and the food is delicious! The first time I went here was with my mom one night and we got her drunk for her 66th birthday! She's a huge margarita fan and she was not disappointed. Matt was our server, he had great recommendations and helped navigate the menu very well. He gave us prompt attention and catered to our requests when needed. Overall he provided and created a wonderful dining experience. I'm excited to go back for round two! Cheers."}
{"text":"The two of us spent $90 and didn't leave full or drunk. Seems all kinds of wrong. 3 tiny tacos each and 2 cocktails plus chips and salsa. They were all delicious, but seems too expensive. Didn't have the best service today either.  Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong here if you need a fun bar that also has awesome food. They have an amazing verde salsa that goes on everything especially on their carne asada tacos that are the bomb. They have taken care of our company gatherings many times when when we are celebrating a major milestone at work. Nikki has always been amazjng to help set this up along with the rest of their amazing staff.   They are truly a class act with amazing food and atmosphere. Rob Mac"}
{"text":"Got to shout out to Matt for having great service and making the experience awesome. Got to shout out Nick too because he's a talented bartender. Really fun restaurant with a great product."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and the have a great menu for food and drinks! We had the 2/$6 tacos which were great along with the chips and salsa and of course some margaritas.  we sat outside which was great and so was the service. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I was so pumped to get here and crush a taco flight...then I see the new menu; everything is a la carte, no substitutions on anything and everything is 20/25% more..? I'm over it and everyone's small ass appetites..that taco flight was the only thing I came for. Eff!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are good and the atmosphere is fun and laid back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.   We were not even offered the free chips and salsa, but the server gave chips and salsa to other tables, found out it was free as we were leaving, server never ever offered to us.

The lettuce bowl is a joke.  You get a small plate with black beans and your choice of toppings, it's not a real salad, its a plate with black beans, your choice of fixings (you pay extra, listed on the menu), very little lettuce.  They ran out of the drink I ordered.  My guest did not like the food either, burrito came out cold.  

We will not be going back.  Service was terrible, food cold, no free chips and salsa.  Yuck, waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best happy hour and food! Let's not forget the magnificent team NICK - NAIT - JOE & GARY!  Best service food and atmosphere!  Love it!  A must try - then you're hooked!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  Margarita's were wonderful!  And the lettuce wrap chicken tacos were phenomenal !"}
{"text":"Great margaritas but a little pricey! The chips and salsa are the best  the menu isn't huge but I've never been disappointed. Service is laid back and it's always a chill vibe. Great location too!"}
{"text":"Went to Modern for the first time on Saturday.  The atmosphere was popping.  We sat out on the patio in July in Arizona.  And it was amazingly comfortable. The food and the service was spot on.  We did not get the Flight of Tacos but had the grilled fish and pork tacos with rice and beans.  So yummy!  And the margaritas were perfect.  I definitely recommend a visit if you have not been there yet."}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour and sitting on the patio.  I've had a couple margaritas here including the OG Rita, OG Rustic, and Sandia margarita (a little sweet, but very fresh) but my favorite is the good 'ol classic modern Margarita on the rocks.  The glasses seem deceivingly small, but the drinks are strong so sip slowly (especially when it's 500 degrees outside - the booze sneaks up on you).  I usually get the veggie tacos (tasty and not too spicy) or quesadilla (quesadilla is okay, nothing too extraordinary about it, but it's meatless so it's an easy order for me).  There are plenty of places to park, but be aware of the reserved spaces in some of the open lots.  I've never had to wait for a table, but I've seen it get busy for happy hour.  If you have a group of more than 6 you might have to wait longer for a table.  I've always had good to excellent service, the vibe is fun and casual, and it isn't too loud inside or outside.  If you can, grab a booth rather than a table because the seats are a little more comfortable."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and waitress was nice. I wanted to love this place but the tacos were over priced for what we got and honestly not that good. $4 for salsa! The first ramekin is free but they seriously charge $4 for each additional ramekin. CRAZY!!!! That is reason enough not to return. Could be a great spot if they improve the food and stop charging for salsa."}
{"text":"Came in at 4:00 for Friday Happy Hour with friends.  Fun, upbeat atmosphere - can not believe it was the same space from the prior sports bar.  They still seem to working out the kinks when things get busy.  Overall staff is very engaged and attentive.  Happy hour menu is super - nachos were sizable and tasty, wings were spot on.  Any errors were quickly addressed and corrected.  Look forward to going back and giving it a second try."}
{"text":"Incredible service from the bar! Rick was extremely informative and very attentive. I love this place already! The vibe is amazing!"}
{"text":"I just love this place

The carne nachos are soooo good and I am totally addicted to their Moscow Mules. The atmosphere is so relaxed and fun! The outdoor patio is such s great place to meet up with friends. 

The staff is super friendly and seem to really enjoy being there. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Me and my boyfriend live 40 minutes away and took a special drive out here for tacos and margaritas and when we walked up to the door and there was a sign saying \"Closing at 8pm due to summer hours\" but it was only 7:30 and when we sat down the server/bartender said \"sorry we are shutting down early cause we have to go to a work thing. \"
Found it unprofessional and highly disappointing that a \"work thing\" was more important than your full restaurant and excited new customers. Definitely won't be taking the drive out here again."}
{"text":"The few times I have been up there, I have had nothing but excellent service and a fun experience. The bar staff is amazing and all very polite, friendly, and quick. I will definitely be returning and will recommend this place to family and friends. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing and is a down to earth place just to hang out. Nait and the bar staff are awesome! 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Service was great, in for happy hour at a busy time and everything was very prompt. My wife, myself and two kids (who eat) had dinner for 70 dollars. That included 4 grown up drinks. Excellent place, make it a stop!"}
{"text":"Good spot to chill and get okay quasi Mexican food. I've never had bad service either."}
{"text":"Best mango jalapeno margaritas in town! Love this place! :)"}
{"text":"Great street tacos & salsa. Had the broiled fish and the shrimp, were fantastic.  Margarita was perfect.  Flan was overcooked, but they topped it with Avion expresso whipped cream and it was unbelievable.  I wouldn't order the flan again though. Servers are always very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance here! I brought my parents here since I had a groupon. We got chips n Salsa, two margaritas (mom got a beer), and grilled fish tacos. It was pretty good food and drinks all around. A bit pricey-er than other Mexican restaurants since they charge for chips."}
{"text":"Was just here this most recent Sunday, or, the night before Labor Day. Modern Margarita has a pretty nice atmosphere with a sweet patio. Good location. We decided to come here because Bourbon Jack's was too busy.

The chips and salsa are tasty but do NOT make your customers pay for sides of salsa. I don't care what the flavors are, they don't warrant $4 per salsa. Whether you're a party of one or a party of four, you get one free salsa to go with your table's chips. We all know how fast that goes. This is awful for the customers and screams greed. If you're going to charge for every additional dish of salsa after the first, it should be per person in the party. For example, if there are six people in your party, your table is entitled to six sides of salsa before the charges are added on. But actually, scratch that idea. Just how about not charging for salsa at all?

My friend and I ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer. They were super good! We agreed it was the best part of the meal. We looked under the \"entree section\" of the menu and noticed the only two items there are a burger and a hot dog. So, our eyes wandered to the taco section, which apparently aren't bold enough to be entrees in their own right. I ordered the carne asada tacos meal, which was $16. They've won awards for those exact tacos, and I don't know how. It sucked. The meat was tough and flavorless. My friend said the same about the tacos he ordered which I think was pork. The rice just tasted bad. I guess the beans were okay.

The waitress took her time, but it wasn't bad enough that it warranted leaving anything below 15%. 

We're friends with some bands that play at Bourbon Jack's across the street, so, after our meal we headed back over. Upon arriving, they asked where we had gone since we didn't eat at Bourbon's. I said \"Modern Margarita.\" They said \"Oh, nice! How was it?\" I said \"Well, they charge for salsa!\" And that pretty much killed it for everyone. We're in our mid to late twenties and whenever we eat out for Mexican, you better believe that salsa gets destroyed. A group of four of us could easily eat seven or eight of those salsa dishes. That would be around $30 in salsa. There is no way we're paying that. Just make it free and you might keep a table of four around long enough to spend well over $100 in drinks. The salsa is good but isn't good enough to charge for.

Free chips and salsa are a staple of solid Mexican joints. The servers know this, otherwise they wouldn't cringe when informing their table's of this charge. Considering they have other locations I doubt they'll make a change. But if they do we might come back."}
{"text":"Went a few days ago, shortly after their opening. Did not see their sign, but we found the place by the crowd in front.  Every seat at the bar and all tables were taking. We found some spa e at the bar and ordered some drinks. No surprise, given their name, as they have a number of different margaritas. I went with the \"Rustic\" which was supposed to be a little spicy, but did not register on my heat index. Ordered the grilled fish tacos, which were great! The place had a good vibe to it, with hip music adding to the experience. Finally, our server, Michelle was friendly and efficient, so the staff had obviously been well trained."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Always a great place to go.  The tacos are very good.  And they have a good happy hour too.  Nick at the bar is great, and the servers are always good too.  

Great patio space!  And it is heated in the winter!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. They have more tables outside than inside. When your in Phoenix in the middle of summer I don't care how many misters they have I want to sit in A/C which we did. I actually like the food portions. I got the chicken street tacos and my daughters got the fish. Some of the chicken was grizzled. Ugh! But, it had an okay flavor and the presentation makes it look better than it is. More cabbage on the fish tacos than fish. My modern margarita was very good but the salt was on only one side of the glass. Salsa were excellent. You have to pay for the chips but we got unlimited portions if we wanted. Our waiter was attentive and very nice.  Poor City North is such a ghost town. I really hope this restaurant improves a little and stays in business!"}
{"text":"They should call this place Magic Margarita, because you magically become invisible once you sit down. We were here for drinks on Ladies' Night. We were surprised to see a DJ, who turned out to be pretty good. There were a decent number of people here, but it was not overly busy. 

We sat at the bar, where the bartender excitedly told us about the margarita of the week, which was peach. It sounded a little to sweet for our taste - the bartender said it was designed for people who don't like the taste of tequila. Why order a margarita then? 

Anywho, after we ordered our first drink (2 for 1 Rustic Margaritas), it was a struggle to order another or even get our check. For having margarita in the restaurant name, the margs aren't the best. They tend to be on the sweet side, probably catering to people who don't like tequila..."}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends.  The \"modern margarita's were excellent.  Chips and salsa \"flight\" was very tasty.  Like the fact the salsa and chips are free refills.  We ordered three types of tacos--they come in \"flights\" of three. Loved the carne asada with chimichuri sauce, pork was excellent, shrimp not so good.  Excellent wait staff replaced the shrimp so we were very happy campers!  We plan to go again and try the award winning chicken tacos.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Margaritas and chicken tacos are delicious!! Only been during the early afternoon and the service is great and not very busy. One of our favorite places to go in this area."}
{"text":"I had a great time with about six of my friends from the taco flight to the delicious margaritas. Nait the General Manager took time to converse with us really tried to impact our visit just wanted to say thanks this place is top notch"}
{"text":"Definitely A-OK!  Very cool ambiance.  Yes, the big funky chandeliers are from Ikea, but that's what's so cool!  You don't have to blow the bank account to give a funky, urban feel.  Whoever did the interior design rocked it---I wanted to go home and re-do my house!  The inside dining room was full, so we were seated on the patio, which thanks to the misters, was very comfortable---and the loud music was pleasantly dimmed.

Okay now...the important stuff.  We went on a Groupon deal.  That always makes the service iffy.  Some servers hear the word \"Groupon\" and shut down.  So all I can say is: \"Sit at Jim's station!!!!\"  Totally great guy----attentive without hovering, chatted without being chatty, exuded niceness and \"I like people and my job\" vibe.  I wanted to take him home and adopt him!  We'll definitely ask to be seated in his section when we return---and the fact we mention returning shows MM was a good time!

We had the $60 for 4 people Groupon.  DH and I both ordered glasses of wine and our under-aged Dining Companions stuck to water.  (Jim brought us all water WITH lemon---extra point!)  The menu is not huge, so we weren't mulling it over for an hour.  But while we considered our options, we ordered the flight of salsas and chips.  Plenty of fresh, crispy chips and the salsas were good!  Tomatillo, chipotle, and pico de gallo. Luckily, amongst the four of us, we all had our favorites, so there wasn't too much squabbling and with free refills of salsas and chips, we got our fill!  In the end, DH ordered the plate of Chicken Street tacos (corn) and I got the Carne Asada Street Tacos (flour), 3 to a plate, then we shared between us.  Our DC's also got the chicken tacos and a chicken salad.  Then between the four of us, we split an order of onion rings.

The onion rings came with a spicy aioli dip.  They were lightly battered, crisp, hot...so good!  I would say totally house-made.  The chicken tacos were okay.  Not a whole lot of flavor, really---I don't think chicken in any form has too much flavor!---but we were piling on lots of the yummy salsas.  The carne asada tacos were very simple.  Some grilled meat, a few slices of avocado, and a ring of onion.  But they didn't need a lot of dressing.  The quality and taste of the beef was so good!  DH ate half of the one I shared and said for sure that's what he was ordering next time!  They were delish.  I didn't sample the kids' chicken salad, but they ate every scrap and commented on how fresh it was, with the lettuce, chicken, apple slices, cheese, egg...they enjoyed!  

A couple of points to earlier reviews: first, yeah, these are small portions but this is more a bar than a restaurant AND it's all about the small plates.  For the quantity and quality, I think prices were very reasonable.  And secondly, I agree---how cool if Jim the Wonder Server had come around with one of those trays of shot-glass desserts.  That would have been a great finale.  We would have squeezed it in, although I have to tell you---between the chips and the tacos and the onion rings and the salad, everybody was very satisfied at the end of the meal.

Good food, great service, reasonable prices, neat ambiance and fifteen minutes from our house----I would be surprised if Modern Margarita doesn't become a regular stop on our dining route!"}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly staff! Ideal location! The style of this place runs second only to the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. We enjoyed every minute. Wonderful margaritas, especially the sandia Rita. Will be coming back again... And again... And again."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. The Margaritas are not good at all and let me tell you,  I know good Margaritas when I taste them. Just like my boyfriend said,  I'll pass on this place.! The only good thing I've tasted here is the salsa. I'll pass on that bland guacamole they served me as well. . Ugh..Just ugh!"}
{"text":"Nick is a great bartender. Very professional and good at his craft.
Food is always good. Salsa and guacamole is on point. 
Price can get up there with Margs but worth it. Good draft beer selection. 
Been to modern margarita 6 or 7 times, very consistent."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and always want to check out Mexican places that have vegetarian options without me having to completely alter items on the menu. I'm sure I drive servers crazy. Anyways, I was excited to try this place put because the veggie tacos and burritos both sounded delicious.
The chips and salsa were good! First round is free, but we didn't even finish the first round, there were a ton of chips. The salsa was delicious, a tiny bit spicy but not too much, it was just right. It was still happy hour, I looked at drinks but I wasn't really in the mood for one. I will have to come back for a margarita sometime.
For my dinner I got the build your own burrito with vegetables and goat cheese. The burrito was massive, larger than chipotle size. Plus it came with pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. The burrito was good but my only complaint was too much cheese. I realize I got two types of cheese and there would be a lot of cheese haha but it was like glued together with cheese, like way more than I could have anticipated. Otherwise yummy, I barely ate half and was dying haha, would been a good meal to split! Not too terribly expensive either."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since we've been here. Loved the tacos, until now. It was slow, there was just one other couple there for lunch. A waiter took our order well enough. Waited some time for our food. While we waited we got to watch the bar tender do nothing but be on his personal phone. Once the food came out, it was cold and tasted terrible! The avocado on the tacos were beyond browned and bad. We asked for no onions, but they were included. We don't typically send back food so we tried to push through, but I nearly threw up after my second bite. It was that bad. We let the waiter know that it was not good at all and had to leave. We won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Tacos were great but small.  The first set of chips were rancid :("}
{"text":"Great find! Lots of great margaritas....if your not a fan like me you can substitute for vodka. I highly recommend the Hot Mango ...I had with vodka so delis! Fun vibe and good salsa. The place is small and always crowded which makes it hard to find a seat.
 High street is a happening spot."}
{"text":"Went here the other with the wifey and was pleasantly surprised with the food, new chef? Not sure but guac, queso, chips nice and hot were all perfect!  Nikki stopped by to ensure we were doing well.  What a great experience!  Huge improvement from our previous visits, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love love coming here for the awesome happy hour specials! I started coming here a year or so ago and am finally getting it into my regular rotation! High Street has a lot to offer but as you may well know a lot of the other options are catered toward various demographics so it's nice to find a place like Modern Margarita. I come here when I want to get a good spicy mango margarita and some chips and  Queso dip. I'm also a huge fan of all of their tacos especially the shrimp and fried fish. TDF! Service is usually on point- everyone always seems in a happy upbeat mood. The only issue we had was at the end paying the bill it took a little bit longer to get the bartenders attention that we were ready but once she ran the cards it was quick from there so no real complaints. Will definitely be back to eat my weight in tacos!"}
{"text":"I don't believe I will be back here. My experience wasn't that great, nor was the food or drink.
My friend and I went here last night for dinner. The atmosphere is cool. its a small place, with a full bar, and several high tables and booths, as well as an outdoor patio. While our waitress was super nice, she was a little bit unfocused. 
I ordered a modern margarita- it had a piece of grapefruit or orange rind in it, not sure why, and the flavors did not mix well. I can say hands down this was the most watered down, and poor tasting margarita I have ever had. I asked for it with no salt, and received salt. Our waitress did offer to fix it, but by that time I was already drinking it.
My friend ordered an Arnold Palmer, but before that she had contemplated a diet coke. The waitress brought a diet coke, and my friend corrected her but said she would keep the drink. the waitress brought back an Arnold Palmer, which my friend said was not the best tasting, and told us we would not have to pay for the drinks (Arnold Palmer and Diet Coke).
For food: my friend got the veggie tostatas which she said were good. The chips and salsa that were brought to the table were good too. the Salsa was spicy, which I like.
I ordered the fries and buffalo wings. The fries were good, they were supposed to have spicy ketchup, but the ketchup didn't taste any different. The wings were horrible. The bbq sauce lacked elements of flavor, they were very very salty, and the ranch was watery and lacked flavor as well.
When we got our bills, my friend was still charged for her drink, we were going to say something but had an obligation at 6:30 and needed to get going.
I feel like this place has some work to do on seasoning, margarita making, and focused service."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place for Happy Hour.  The hot mango margarita is the MUST try on the menu.  Their food is good and service has always been good when I've gone. I have no complaints and it's a staple on our happy hour rotation! Sundays are happy hour pricing all day, yes please and thank you!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and had a blast. Last night the AC was broke and it was so hot. Very uncomfortable and overall not a great experience. 
Love be the tacos though !"}
{"text":"Great place for a Sunday All Day Happy Hour! Their drinks are on special which is exactly what we needed as we were toasting a friend of ours who had recently passed away but loved her some margaritas, chips, salsa and guac. So we honored her by having all  of her favorites. The HOT MANGO margarita which is Chili-infused Blanco, Fresh Lime, Triple Sec, Mango was absolutely delicious! Their mini pork tacos along with the endless supply of chips and salsa was equally as good. Seriously a great place to celebrate a friends life and toast to her. I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with food because we never made it that far. We checked in and they told us an hour wait. They took my phone number and said they would text when it was our turn. All of that was fine. About an hour later I went to check how it was going when I was informed it would be another hour. They had my number and could have text to tell us that. The girl up front seemed over welmed and truly uninterested. Not a good first visit.  I gave it 2 stars only because they were giving margarita samples when we first checked in and they were good"}
{"text":"$20 margaritas!  That should really say it.  16oz, 70% ice, $16 on happy hour.  Ridiculous.  Pretty sure Vegas has better prices.  Food was mediocre, nothing really stood out.  Except the margarita prices.  Sheesh."}
{"text":"They have a sign out front that says seat yourself so we go in find a table  and begin to order then a waitress  comes over and says you have to move these tables are reserved a drops a  reserved sign on our table.. there are no more tables and therefire we can't stay.  Not cool."}
{"text":"Street taco and skewers kind of place.  Food was light and fresh.  They serve onion rings which is kind of weird but then who doesn't like onion rings.  

Lots of Tequila on the shelf that are all reasonably priced.  Nothing high end but it's more of a margarita joint than a Tequila sipping bar.  

Place is a bit squishy but the outside patio is pretty large."}
{"text":"We don't make it up to High Street very often, but recently headed to Modern Margarita for a happy hour birthday celebration for a friend... We were seated in the back of the restaurant at a long high top table that was perfect for our group of 6.  

Des was our waitress and she was attentive and kind.  Amongst the group, we shared chips, guac, salsa, wings, some quesadillas, some tacos, and of course... more than a few margaritas!

If you find yourself in the north Phoenix area seeking a casual atmosphere to hang and enjoy a few drinks and decent Mexican cuisine, look no further than Modern Margarita."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are great. You feel like you're on vacation here. However, I wasn't expecting to here hard music about crack and ho's. That was the deal killer....it could've been a great atmosphere but I couldn't enjoy where I hear f bombs in the background in this north Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in desert ridge! The tacos are delicious! The queso is a must try, as well. Modern Margarita is a great spot for happy hour every day."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Crap service and management. 
Lets start  with our first impression. Show up and only a 15 minute wait with seats available at the bar on the corner. That's awesome for a  Saturday night! Told the hostesses we would be sitting on the corner of bar right by us ( 2 calls, apparently she can take a number but not notes) Not a hard position, my dear.

We order a couple margaritas from a friendly bartender. Drinks were good and his service was attentive. Your doing this restaurant a big favor.

That's when this review goes bad. We were then seated outside in beginning of March at 8p. Weather had changed to getting cool fast. Hello Mr or Ms Manager. When people have thier arms close to thier bodies and hands between thier legs, it should be a sign to stop standing around and start making sure paying guests are comfortable. Look around, be observant it's almost half the patio doing the same thing. Train your staff. Yes, I've managed for 15yrs and it's not rocket science. That's why your owner bought the outdoor heaters. 
Our waiter was overwhelmed. We saw him twice. Order was right except for the extras we order did not come. I informed him on my girls last couple bites. And then he wanted to go grab them, no thanks! Too late, you should check with your tables within the first few mins of thier food arrival. However, he wouldn't have known. He didn't even bring our food out , nor did he pick up our check. We checked ourselves out...and your lucky we are not thieves. 10+ min to pick up a cc is unacceptable after u drip it off. Btw, u are welcome for the tip ..you didn't deserve it.
Note to owner: if you need a consultant for you nice restaurant feel free to contact my company. Apparently your managers are failing you as this is our second bad experience, but food is good. I have people on my staff with 20+yrs of experience."}
{"text":"Sammi was an amazing server. 
I have been coming to Modern margarita since it opened. I have always enjoyed their rendition of mexican street food. I had the burrito as a vegan it hit the spot. I am slightly disappointed we used to get the taco flight it was $45 now it is $60?! I really enjoy sitting out on the misted patio in a booth. I highly recommend their chipotle margarita it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food, rice and beans alone were very tasty, flavored just perfect.  The drinks were good, and it was a nice atmosphere.

I sat at the bar, and the bartender made a good waiter, but I couldn't say anything about their service.  Also I went in when a very few people were dining, so it was a mellow experience for me."}
{"text":"This place is a true bar experience.  

It's loud and noisy 
television's everywhere 
drinks pouring from the tap
bar food popping 
good looking people

This is all you need.... go and have fun!"}
{"text":"It's awesome! We just discovered it couple of weeks ago and we keep coming back to it. The chips & salsa flight is awesome, especially the chipotle salsa. The Rustic Margarita is my fav and the tacos are all absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"Great  place to hang out and have some drinks the appetizer are amazing the chicken and steak skewers are out of this world and me and my husband also loved the tacos the Green dip sauce is crazy good we could just drink it Been back about a  4 times in about  2 months also there on groupon you can't beat the deal that's a plus to go back also    

But the music can be a bit loud I don't mind the music but when you can't hear your self talk,  service can be a bit better but overall nicer"}
{"text":"Talk about a new flavorful experience this is the place to go! I love their margaritas I had two hot mango margaritas and my mom had a cucumber serrano which was a little too spicy but our waiter switched it out free of charge for a casa margarita and then she had a cucumber serrano one without the chillies which she loved! We enjoyed them thoroughly! The food was excellent as well I ordered the roasted pork tacos which had amazing flavors in the pineapple avocado sauce that came with them. My mom ordered the grilled fish tacos which were really juicy and had great flavors as well. Even though it was really hot we sat outside and they had misters that kept it feeling like a cool breeze. The ambiance was really fun with the lighting and the service was amazing as mentioned before my mom did not like her drink and he replaced it with something new free of charge! Definitely recommend coming here for a new twist on tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"Nait Wiggs is fantastic! Our drinks were great love this bar Def coming back! Donte the door man was super friendly and helped us get our lyft ride home.  This place is great!"}
{"text":"What a great place to have fun!  Margaritas are really good!  Outdoor seating is a plus, and everyone is very pleasant.  Having the veggie tacos is a good idea for those non-meat people.  Definitely will go there again."}
{"text":"Just made my first trip here. Met friends for Happy Hour. I had a couple of appetizers along with with a nice Pino Noir. The ambiance is great and the food and service is definitely worth the trip. Krislyn and Ali took care of us which made the evening even more memorable. Will definitely be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"First time visitor today. Wow! Everything was excellent, starting with the complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was awesome! Since it was Monday, the margaritas were $3 off. Delicious and not weak! I then ordered the Green Chile cheeseburger. It's on their summer specials menu. It was a good deal at only $8. Great service, friendly staff. Will definitely be going back. Taco Tuesday? Okay, can't go back tomorrow, but very soon!"}
{"text":"food, drinks, atmosphere, staff: all are amazing! I've never had a bad experience, the food is so good, and the staff is so friendly and engaging. my boyfriend and I are here at least once a week, because MM has everything we love."}
{"text":"Music was way too loud, guacamole was $8.00 for essentially two tablespoons worth, and menu was a little overpriced for the quantity. Staff was friendly, but I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Spring is here and this patio is great!  People that come are nice to rate. The food is acceptable for the zip code.  But people and all Mexican restaurants, real Mexican rice isn't white."}
{"text":"Food is good. Great pulled pork and guac. The Margs are NOT modern, and use the same sweet and sour they use in Minnesota. The service is habitually slow and unattentive. Definitely go to get some beers and tacos. Just don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Truly a great place- the staff makes it feel like home. They let you pick the music depending on the night- it's like our own homegrown cheers! Gotta try the queso here  for sure. Shout out to the bartenders that remember you and always have a smile!I The carne asade is the best I've ever had...great food; strong support staff... went to school for hotel/restaurant mgmt. and these guys get it... great product, great service, easy formula for success"}
{"text":"Was not tasty at all. The gauc lacked seasoning. The margarita I had was very bland looking for a strawberry, it looked more like a week food coloring. Not very busy and it is way over priced for what you get. Huge tables inside and outside the misters were pouring off water, so sitting out there was out of the question. I had the shrimp taco and the cheese was so rank it smelled like a cow pasture. I use this kind of cheese all the time and when it gets old it gets rank............. They remade the taco and it was just ok, but if they would have been smart about wanting people to return, they would not have charged me for that taco. My husband was done eating by the time they remade the taco. A manager came by, but never offered to clear if off our bill. Service was just ok, not very attentive until we had a complaint. I can't say that we will return or recommend ........Over priced for sure......... sorry have to be truthful."}
{"text":"We went on a living social deal and we felt that this place was fun, great food and yummy Margarittas with great value for the money.  They were having happy hour so we added guamole, and 2 beers.
 
Started with the salsa sampler with free refills tasty. My husband had the grilled fish tacos and loved them, however for some strange reason mine didn't taste as good, however i told the waitress Jen and she asked if I wanted something else.  i asked for ONE carne asda Taco and I felt is was very good and again yummy.  I also took the other 2 carene asda taco's to go.

Customer service here is 5 star.  They really try to please their customers.  Can't wait to go back for Sunday happy hour which is all day for food and drinks."}

{"text":"Just had a mid-day lunch at Modern Margarita. Great Place! I am not one to write a review about a restaurant, but felt compelled for MM.

Nice place to go for lunch! My wife and I sat outside on the patio, which provided us with a nice view of the whole establishment. Attention to detail is obvious, with the natural wood colors, and concrete countertops on the bar.

I was curious about the Hot Mango Margarita, so I thought I would give it a try. Yeap...It's spicy!. But really good. Worth a try. We both enjoyed our food, (Pork Street Taco's and Steak Salad) and the presentation. The service was friendly and attentive.

After going for lunch, we now want to go back from dinner and drinks. The day time vibe is cool, but I bet the evening is even better. 

To the owners...nicely done. We look forward to coming back and spreading the word! Thanks for opening in City North. It's nice to see businesses opening up in this great location!

GRACIAS!"}
{"text":"Larry, the bartender, is the best! I told him how much of a sweet tooth I have, and he recommended the Sonoran Sunset margarita. It was absolutely delicious! 
I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Shrimp taco was the only good thing. Veggie taco was insanely over salted, the beer battered fish tasted foul, the grilled fish was okay but had too strong of a sauce. Wouldn't recommend. I do recommend their sister restaurant across the street La Bocca."}
{"text":"GREAT HAPPY HOUR, GREAT CHIPS, CONSISTENTLY PRO SERVICE

I am not a person who craves Mexican food, so for me to put this place high on my list s a statement.

THE GOOD:  Happy hour is alive and packed with great value. The staff seem to amp up a bit too which makes it fun.  The staff is always impressively knowledgable about the menu and details in preparation, plus they are well trained.  He food is cravable.  With the exception of a guacamole that neither offends nor impresses and some mediocre ribs ( but my fault for ordering them at a Mexican restaurant), the menu is loaded with can't miss items.  If you go when the kitchen is slow, the manager may let you mix and match taco plates at the price of the most expensive.  The real hits are the fish tacos.  I love the grilled mahi but the fried mahi is very flavorful.  Do not miss the chips.  They come out hot and never soggy.  Pair them with the smokey salsa and beer-queso (skip the guacamole...average).  My favorite time to come here is mid-day or early dinner. Perfect neighborhood vibe.

THE BAD:  When this place gets crowded, the house tries to seat the patio.  This isn't a bad thing in those six months of great weather but the hostesses pressure guests to sit the patio on 105f nights and in the winter it's the frost. They will go out of there way to turn a mister or heater in season but I personally always feel that the pressure to sit ruins the rest."}
{"text":"So I waited about 15 mins for this bartender to walk up, waited another 5 mins for him to look past the cougers next to me and ask for my drink. Went to the office to get a lighter for the said cougers while I waited. The drink itself seemed like it was over poured which normally I wouldn't mind, except for the lack of attention. Drank my rum and coke, and sat patiently for another 25 mins! Before he looked at me and asked if I wanted another. I declined, asked for my tab and waited another 10 mins for him to actually get my check. Needless to say I will not be coming back while salt and pepper Rick is working."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for drinks and food for HH on Fri.  No one was at the hostess stand and waited for 5 mins.  After that we just went it.  The only seats we could find was at a long high top that had about 10 stools.  Since the table was empty we grabbed the end two

After another 10 minutes of waiting a staff member approached saying we needed to move.  Very rude and we asked why?  She said the table was reserved.  We said we had waited at the stand and after no one was there we found our own seats.  She said that didn't matter and we needed to move.  We promptly left after a such a rude staff member.  Go elsewhere ."}
{"text":"I've got to break this review down the middle. The food quality is just about average. Reasonably priced bar grub, tasty but not delish enough to satisfy the true foodie in us all.

Started with the chips and salsa. Three dipping sauces. The Rojo picate was by far the best of the three. Pretty average as far as chips go. 

2nd course...Carne Asada street tacos. Fairly priced and tasty, even with the corn tortilla. Good carne. 

For entrees we split two dishes...the shrimp salad and the Black Angus burger. Salad was average. I think they're trying too hard with this dish, trying to pull off a sweet spicy warmth but didn't quite get there. The burger was above average. Really liked the mozzarella cheese with red pepper topping. A natural combo, sure to work! Wonder why I haven't run into this before ;)

The atmosphere is very relaxing, lively and warm with the inside / outside bar top and great fire pit seating. Not to mention they have like 150 sections of tequila and a little bit of Mezcal. Very nize....:)

Nice joint, would recommend it for sure as a happy hour staple in anyone's monthly rotation. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Gotta say the food was good, only had small bites. Steak tostadas yes! But nothing matters when the service is great the lime juice is fresh. The cucumber Serrano margarita! Baby that hit the spot but then we doubled back and had the $200 shot! Smooth as baby bottom! But if you don't go crazy like us the $50 Real is very nice too. I forget their names but never their prices! If you drink margaritas you will have a normal bar tab. But splurge! YOLO!"}
{"text":"I didn't have my expectations set very high after only seeing a 3 1/2 star average on Yelp.  But I was pleasantly surprised as the tacos were good, and the happy hour was even better.  I had the trio of shrimp tacos and our table shared some guacamole, carne asada tostadas, and steak fries.  Everything was really good, and the pacing of the food was great as well.  I definitely prefer the hole in the wall Mexican joint most of the time, but the upscale Mexican restaurant has it's place and this one is a good one."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were fantastic! We sat at the bar and Gary was our bartender. Great service.. I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink and he whipped up an amazing margarita for me.. very unique, made with blackberries.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the carna asada tacos, very good...liked the rice and beans as well.  Services was pleasant.  Have to agree on the ambience, not really impressive inside.  Also, I think the menu could offer more, especially more Mexican items."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Food, drinks, atmosphere and a great happy hour is a plus! Yum :)"}
{"text":"Happy Hour everyday.. Thank you for finally figuring out what most people want. The agave wings are def worth trying! My fiance and I come here for a drink and a bite to eat on the regular. We bring our pup as well on the dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for drinks and food but today the drinks were not good at all.  All of the margaritas were like water and after ordering our 2nd or 3rd, we started getting better drinks.  Our server also did not do anything even though few us complained about our drinks.   It's normally not like this and we hope today was a mishap."}
{"text":"We stopped in for our first visit before the Christmas parade of lights 2016.
My wife had 3 happy hour margaritas in an hour( 18.00). I had a coke. She left straight as she walked in the door. C'MON  MM......what was actually in that shallow margarita glass packed to the top with ice? Certainly not a proper margarita that is 9.00 each after Happy hour. 

The food was ok and the free chips n salsa were a pleasant surprise. The staff were on point with plenty of smiles....BUT.... your namesake which costs more than many of your entrees Is a fugazi. A fake.
Please fix this.......because my review is not the first addressing this expensive issue. I do realize you are in a high rent district and that bar alcohol is a science and a game of strict numbers.
Unfortunately, the numbers didn't add up
For us.
Patrons beware.... :("}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice patio (except for smokers), decent beer and great street tacos. Hip clientele of all ages, good for people watching."}
{"text":"I went to Modern last weekend and had the time of my life. Never have I had better service or experience. Im not the type to leave a review on yelp unless it's negative and im trying to warn people.  Not modern the most memorable part of my experience was my bartender Larry. Talk about attentive especially with how busy he was. Me and my date had the best time I recommend modern to everyone it's not just for great drinks but great times."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 3 others and it was a great place to people watch, eat amazing Mexican fare and delicious drinks. I enjoyed my time here muchly! :P

SERVICE: Always with a smile. Personable and had great recommends. 
FOOD: DELICIOUS. Had the shrimp, veggie and fish tacos. Yum Yum. Not oily, or too salty. Just right. Margaritas were strong but you tasted all flavors, which is important to me. So yay!

You should go!"}
{"text":"So the place was busy DJ was playing, but loud but I guess it's Saturday night. Me and my friend got beer and tacos. We were somewhat speaking loudly so we can hear one another, server was soft spoken and barely heard him. 

We also ordered chicken and steak tacos, steak taco was tasty, chicken taco was good but I had bones in mine. 

Server was attentive and waters were filled every time they passed by us. On average it was ok, I'd probably return another time but not on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, lousy service! This is our third time at Modern Margarita & it's been the same every time! They need to train their waitstaff."}
{"text":"Service is so slow they messed up my drink order twice then and the server forgot the chips and salsa never filled up the water and had a terrible attitude or and let not forget the bartender was hanging on the bar on his phone texting for a while not working. They need some serious management changes or something. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. But slow service and 4 bucks  for chips and salsa that looked like ketchup earns it a two star. Super noisy but kind of expected that with all the street noise."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio was a great place to catch up with friends. A Watermelon Honey Margarita and an order a Yucatan-style pork tacos made it perfect! If you like a little spice, be sure to ask for the salsa verde! Next time I'll come with more people or a bigger appetite so we can try the taco flight- 15 assorted tacos!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch mid-week with a good friend. We thought the open patio/dining would be great for a sunny day snack., drink and 'catching-up',
Food was good, the tacos(we had an assortment of all)were delicious,had flour & corn tortillas- tasty! Salsas were also fab. Only downside to the experience was the sudden appearance of flies when the food arrived- & we were inside the restaurant.- being an open-air setting, it was understandable, just annoying.
Be sure to notice that the sink for the restroom is a communal one, you pass by it before you get to the restroom doors!"}
{"text":"If you've been to the Desert Ridge location and were (rightfully) impressed- don't expect the same feeling here in Chandler. 

The place was near empty (should have been our first sign) and smelled like dirty bar mats. We were given our free chips and salsa but waited a good 10 minutes to have a drink order taken. The bartend advised that they were dead and then let their server go and got busy (please note this bar was not busy). 

Again waited 10-15 minutes to order our food. My friends chicken taco was absurdly bland, no seasoning or flavor what so ever. My shrimp taco was good but came with two tiny shrimps for $5. Our rice never came, and couldn't tell the bartender because she was busy chatting with the men at the end of the bar. 

When it came time to pay she grabbed our cards (that were out as a signal we were ready to pay). I tried to quickly grab her attention as she rushed off and let her know we shouldn't be charged for the rice. She came back stating she gave us a 10% discount but still somehow we both paid more than we should have, and wouldn't know because no itemized recipe was given. 

Wouldn't not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday for the first time and really liked the place. Food was great and atmosphere was pretty cool. Not sure if lunch and dinner have different menus but you can't beat the delicious tacos for just $7. I would imagine that in going at night time, there's a very cool vibe (1/2 the place is outside and perfect for this soon-to-be fall weather). Everything we ordered was very tasty and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place. We hit this place up for a buddies bday after one of his friends got us kicked out of Sandbar. The name sounded promising... A) Who doesn't love margaritas, and B) a modern hip place is usually fun. 

However, when we got there, we quickly found out why its in N. Scottsdale. The crowd is essentially a 45 year old and up early dinner crowd. 

The drinks: 
After all this a bar entitled with the word Margarita in it. So the Margs and premade, and the bartenders just pour them into glasses from a carafe. This has its positives and negatives. 

Positive: The drinks come out quick.. You order, she pours, done. 
Negative: No human element to it. If you request it a little sweet, they have to alter it. If you want more agave nectar, no chance, etc... 

I personally am never coming back: But thats because I don't live up there. If I lived in Cave Creek or Desert Ridge, etc, you'd probably eventually find a menu item you'd like and find a way to make the margaritas not too sweet. Like I did by adding beer to it."}
{"text":"First time here...under whelmed. Ordered (took a long time..no one was in the place) Steak tostados...three tiny tortilla the size of a silver dollar...$7...rip off. Ordered Carne Asada street tacos...served ice cold...had to be remade. The manager made it right..chomped the cold food...I'll try this place again....to be fair..."}
{"text":"Reasons Modern Margarita is amaze balls!

1) Their Margaritas are ridiculously good... fresh, delicious, and quite dangerous if consumed in high quantities during HH
 
2) I love their tacos - so much so that it wasn't too long ago that I was dared to consume their 15 taco flight, I did... Made Adam Richman from Man Vs. Food proud!

3) I still want to eat their tacos after my infamous 15 taco consumption challenge

4) Their happy hour is one of the best in town

5) Service is always spot on... Never ever have I ever had a grumpy waiter/ waitress/ bartender/ hostess... you get the point

So.... there you go my friends, 5 reasons why Modern Margarita should be on your list of places to go for Taco Tuesday, Margarita Mondays, Tequila Thursdays, Salty Saturdays, Sloppy Sundays, Fajita Fridays (so what if they don't serve Fajitas) or Wasted Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from an advertisement on Fox 10. Cory (from Fox 10) was talking about how good it was. I happened to get on groupon and saw they had a groupon. I bought it and I don't regret it! My husband and I just got done eating there. Great food! Nice people! And good Drinks!"}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here for happy hour. The pork tacos are my favorite! And the service is always great :)"}
{"text":"We took our whole family including three kids here tonight for dinner and everything we had was sooo good. The onion rings were amazing. The chips and house salsa were perfect with that ghost pepper. Spicy wings. Chicken quesadilla, burritos, pork tacos and carne tacos. The food was spot on and just as important, so was our server Ashley. She was attentive and cheerful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, but stay away! I've been here twice hoping my first try was a bad night for them. As others have said, the staff is not experienced, not friendly, and almost pissy that they are working. 
We walked in and the bar tender just stared at me and my hub. A patron had to tell us to find our own seat. THEN...there was a shard of glass in my margarita. The manager handled it poorly. Blamed dishwasher?
The patio and decor are nice, but staff ruin it. Had to ask for every little thing...napkin,straw, silverware, etc. 
seriously needs improvement bf ill spend money there again"}
{"text":"This place can be compared to joyride. It is not the best place for tacos, though it was filling! The chicken tacos with guac and lemon are quite tasteful. Although, the customer service was far below expectations. The waitress looked at my party as if she hated her job. I had asked for water and was handed a cup with lipstick on it because \"they had to wait to get more glasses because they were all dirty\". One of my guests glasses also was stained with what it looks like milk in the glass of WATER they ordered. We also ordered seconds on our drinks and never received them. Also one of my guests had ordered fish tacos and had to wait until the check arrived in order to get his tacos. Even the check took way longer to be received after everyone was done eating their food. Over all it was not very sanitary nor customer friendly. Defiantly not going to celebrate my next birthday here."}
{"text":"Great scene with lots of tvs. The vegetarian tacos, bean dip and chips are very good. The guacamole is a little lifeless. 

The service and speed of food is the only downfall here. There have been a couple of times that it took way to long considering it's not that busy. 

I think the price is great on happy hour and worth it. The staff is friendly. It's definitely a laid back kind of place so don't come here in a hurry."}
{"text":"We went to Modern Margarita with some friends. Immediately we asked our server when Happy Hour was. He told us and we happen to be there in time, so we were excited. We go to order and we all order off of the Happy Hour menu. The waiter proceeds to ask us, \"beans and rice okay?\". We all said, yes! We enjoy our meal. Then the bill comes and we see we were charged full prices for what we ordered. When asking the waiter why this was, he said \"the happy hour tacos don't come with rice and beans\". Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Happy Hour prices for what we ordered were $6.00. We were charged $11.00....so $5.00 for rice and beans? Very disappointing and aggravating. Not the way to run a business. Not sure if we will be coming back and will be sure to tell all our friends our experience and warn them about the rice and beans"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment for the first time for a Raven's business mixer and was impressed by the service and the food was quite delicious.  I order 2 margarita's on the rocks and had their mahi fish tacos and a side of guacamole.  Both dishes were good and seemingly healthy.  The bar area had spacious seating and the restroom had superb lighting, unlike some bars where you can't see a thing.  I like the modern decor and the bar service was professional and easy on the eyes ;-).  The only minor issue I would say they  need to take care of at this establishment was the condensation dripping from the ceiling yet that's a quick fix, just moved to a dry spot and carry on with the night. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here I'm extremely happy with the food buy however every time service is severely lacking. This time checked out the bathroom, I had my little niece with me and I was very upset with the setup. No changing table, unacceptable and then the soap is in tacky cheap squeeze bottles. This is a nice place in a nice area and can't have a decent soap dispenser is ridiculous. Add a changing table, real soap dispenser and more attentive staff/faster did delivery and you will be a 5 star easily. The food is so good that is what keeps me coming back. Grilled fish tacos amazing actually they are all good except the chicken tacos which is weird cause I love chicken everything. Green chili burger and Angus burger yum. If you are getting chips and salsa get the salsa flight, trust me. Pass on the garlic fries. Warning ketchup is spicy. Love their Moscow mules, they are served in Cooper mugs. Be prepared to surrender an ID for the copper mug."}
{"text":"I had the Carne salad and it was good. Margarita was killer. Nice staff and Kati the manager was very nice and made us feel welcome.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and margaritas were tasty (unfortunately a bit overpriced). My husband, who eats meat, loved the pork tacos. And as someone who's trying to find meatless alternatives, I loved the veggie tacos! I would have given five stars but the server's didn't notice us for 20 minutes. We'll try again soon."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Street tacos were so yummy and the atmosphere was great. Service was fast and friendly as well. The salsa was a little too spicy but that's about it!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour at the bar and tried the house Margarita that was very good for the price. Food was also very good and plenty offered on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Bartenders are amazing! Especially Nick and Matt! Nate is the best manager he took really good care of us, as well as nick! Seriously, you have to check this place out! Nothing but positive vibes!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Modern Margarita! They had live music even on a Tuesday night which was great for celebrating a birthday. Wally, our bartender, was fantastic and made great drink recommendations! Not everyone in our group really likes tequila but he asked what we liked and made the drinks perfectly! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were not a all impressed and were amazed at the number of people that were willing to pay for bad food and drinks.
I ordered a glass of wine that was the smallest glass of wine I was ever served. It was not even a short-pour it was a miniscule pour. For four people we got a tiny saucer of salsa and we were charged $2 for a second one. The shrimp tacos and the fish tacos were so dry they were horrible. If we had not been so hungry due to the long wait we would have sent them back. The tacos had dried out fish and cabbage on them. That's all..no cheese, salsa, sour cream, guacamole ..NOTHING! 
Everything is an extra charge- rice and beans with the tacos are extra too so don't agree to have them unless you are willing to pay extra for them. The owners should be embarrassed and hopefully this place will get some competition so they wake up and realize they are cheating people!"}
{"text":"Went there for Cinco DeMayo and was charged 20$ for crappy margaritas. The special started 10 minutes after we ordered. We were never informed that we were getting charged the regular price. Our waitress \"forgot\" about us (her words not mine). The food was not good either."}
{"text":"Average bar great location.  Good late night.  Worth stopping in.  They had a good dj when we went and no cover."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos rock but for some reason their tequila has a rusty after taste to me so I prefer their margs with Don Julio silver :D usually friendly enough staff and sometimes a short wait for a table!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for tequila. Margaritas are my weakness and this restaurant does not disappoint. MM was the first restaurant I went to a few weeks after having my second child and just 1 watermelon margarita was all I needed because they make them strong and delicious! We always share the quesadilla, chips&salsa and chicken wings which are yummy and the patio is my fav. spot to look at downtown!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an amazing atmosphere. The bartenders are amazing and get to know each customer. They make sure your needs are met and you enjoy your time. I have never had a bad meal here. They have great happy hour specials from 3 to 6:30."}
{"text":"Here's a nice place to spend your night, (it will take all of it) if that's alright.
There is no depth beyond the bar, 
and the kitchen is sub-par.
How do I know? I had a view, 
and what I witnessed was a zoo. Servers running in AND out with empty trays and pursed-lipped mouths. 
Empty glasses, cold-served food 
and frazzled waiters dodging you.
If there's a place I'd recommend, 
Give ear to me my famished friend. 
Get up from here and move your feet 
To any other on this street.
'Cause life's to short to waste your time,
Just ask me, I wasted mine!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time we go here the food and drinks are always on point. We get very excited when we are seated with our favorite server Matt. His service is always fantastic and he always goes above and beyond. We've also gotten to know Nick the bartender very well. The drinks are always excellent and he makes great recommendations. Perfect way to relax after a hard day. These guys are a blast and make our dining experience a great one every time. It's rare to find a place where the food and service are consistent and amazing."}
{"text":"Great spot with nice selection of tequilas.  Monster taco item on menu lets you sample every kind they have.
Nice patio, friendly staff.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, margaritas are refreshing but there is no way there was a full shot of tequila in it. I ordered a $4 shrimp taco and it was literally \"a shrimp\" taco with Toni shrimp that I ate in one bit, the rest was all cabbage and I don't have a big bite. We also ordered the hot dog and it came with 6 French fries... 6. The service was slow, we were sitting for 30 minutes before the server came back to take our food order after dropping g off the sub par drinks. Won't be my next first or second choice next time I want tacos or margaritas. Oh and to top it off they charge for salsa, not particularly good salsa, just plain blended tomato salsa. We don't mind paying but we want quality if we do."}
{"text":"I was invited to Modern Margarita via their Facebook for one of their first nights. I enjoyed the food but was a little disappointed with the drinks. 

When I asked to change the tequila to something a little \"higher shelf\" they were unable to do it. They pre-mixed everything instead of making items fresh. I am hoping that as they get through the initial opening, they are able to help customers out with requests like these. 

Overall the service was good, the atmosphere was nice. It feels very much like a new \"trendy hot spot\" where often people are looking to see and be seen. 

If I have a group of girlfriends looking for a night out, this place will now be on the list."}
{"text":"Soo...the one reason we came here was because my sister decided this had the shortest wait list. But I looked up the reviews ahead of time and was skeptical before hand. We had a party of 8 and we got seated within 30 minutes. As soon as I saw the menu i knew right away this place was wayyyy over priced for mexican food. I wouldn't mind in most cases, but the food was subpar mexican food nothing special.  It was $4.50 for a small street taco, like come on. I got a margarita and it was good. The waitress did mix up the orders and gave the wrong burrito to one of us, but she took care of it and took both burritos off the bill. Be aware if you order meat as an extra its like a crazy cost between $4-5. And the food is  not over sized either. That's was makes it so over prices for the food. But idk if it weren't for the waitress compensating for the mix up, i would have given it a 3 star review because it is over priced."}
{"text":"This place has a cool breezy vibe. The tortilla chips are light and crispy but the salsa, queso and guacamole need a revision...funny thing is the salsa and queso were too salty and the guac was bland. The margs weren't that great either. They were a bit short of sweetness. Just a few tweaks and it could be better......."}
{"text":"So Went to Modern Margarita twice in the past week mostly highs with one big drawback.  Here is the way I see it.  I defintly will be back because the tacos and margaritas are outstanding.  The carne asada tacos is incredible and the ghost pepper sauce is just wonderful.  My compliments to the chef on a job well done. 

A few things I recommend though however.

Granted I get it, it has been 115 degrees outside Fix the Darn Air Conditioning or discount the bill,  Do Not EVER tell a customer well you can go sit outside under the misters.  When its 115 outside and your ac is not working correctly do you really think the customer wants to sit outside in the humid heat either.  Your a female manager learn some Customer Service skills that is not how you take care of your guests.   Pick up a phone and call HVAC repairman, dont make customers suffer, it hurts your bottom dollar when you do.  

The only thing I reccomend about the food is that there is more of it and more of a variety.  Maybe like a combo platter of tacos during lunch 1 shrimp, 1 chicken, 1 pork and 1 carne asada.  Sometimes I bring people in and they want to see which they like best.  Instead of ordering mutiple orders you guys should look into that.  

If it had not been for the AC being down on our visit for a business lunch I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"I met someone here for drinks. I had a strawberry margarita on the rocks and thought it was delicious. Cool atmosphere and enjoyed hanging out at Modern Margarita. A+"}
{"text":"Great time on a Saturday evening. Chose this place since they had a Saturday HH. Devon (sorry if I miss spelled it) our server was awesome! She took such great care of our table. Go see her! Delish chips, salsa and guacamole.  Loved the hot mango margi. Nice patio/atmosphere as well. My only negative...it's not your super cheap happy hour place. The larger size margaritas ended up being $16 and that happy hour price..."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it will be our last.   Walked in on a Saturday afternoon to a very empty bar.   We ordered wings to start but requested all drummettes (we have friends that do this here no prob) but the bartender denied this request.  Not a big deal, so we order drinks and were told they are out of the chambord margaritas, which is the main reason we came !   So we decided to leave and the bartender was very aloof and didn't seem to care.  Not very impressed with the staff and being out of one of your most popular margaritas is unacceptable when the name of your restaurant is \"Modern Margarita\""}
{"text":"The manager Brent is awesome! He really takes care of his regulars! The chicken tacos are the best. You really need to try the rustic margarita! Great happy hour prices! We have been here another time and it was great as this time. So happy to come again! Great place!"}
{"text":"The Good:
Grilled fish tacos = Delicious


The Bad:
Margaritas (yes, at \"modern margarita\" the margaritas were terrible)

Okay:
Pork Tacos
Guacamole
Chips & Salsa = pretty good, but they were out of the chipotle salsa so we didn't get to try that one even though we paid for it."}
{"text":"Great tacos, one of the DJ'S is amazing, but they need to up the staff a tad! Overall a great place for tacos even if it isn't Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"We used a Groupon to try this place. We ordered the street Tacos so we could get to try all the different Taocs. They brought out the taco on a long wooden board which was a cool idea. I really liked every single one of them. It would be hard to pick one that stood out more than the other. Lots of great specials everyday. Happy Hour is a good deal. Just keep in mind that if you order a Margarita during Happy Hour you don't get the HH pricing if you're using a Groupon. :( I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I'm beyond disappointed in this place. They have an amazing all day happy hour on Sunday, but they've ruined my favorite margarita recently. I love the Sonoran, but now it has lost its sweetness. Our server was all too eager to pull my drink off of the table when we asked for the check(still willing to pay) and kick us out the door. This used to be one of our favorite destinations on a lazy day, but it is most definitely crossed off now. You can't ask what you can do for me if you can't make my favorite margarita the way you made it a few weeks ago then expect me to want to stay. I can get a margarita anywhere. I wanted that specific one from that specific place."}
{"text":"Food was OK at best. I went for cinco de mayo and it was like a frat party. However I will say the service was impeccable for such a busy wild night like that. Kudos to the staff"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Our party of 6 got the taco flight + 2 apps.  Everyone loved the food and margaritas. Super cute environment. Service was a tad slow on this busy Saturday night. I'd come back for sure next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Anytime we are in Tempe we always eat at sister restaurant Modern Tequila and since we live in North Phoenix, definitely was looking forward to sampling this joint. 

So here is my experience -- our server was either not very smart or borderline rude, couldn't figure out which (Michelle) never brought us silverware or plates even after our main course showed up. When I asked her for silverware she only brought one fork, not for anyone else at the table...girl was in such a hurry that she missed out on at least 4 more drink orders and acted slightly put out when we stopped her to order another round, I don't get it, made me feel uncomfortable just asking for another margarita (good margi's.) With that said will not let this initial experience keep us from hanging on the patio again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but my main complaint is I felt they were trying to nickel and dime us. After buying expensive drinks we were asked if we wanted chips and salsa I figured they were complimentary due to the way the girl asked. I hadn't even looked at a menu at this point. Then before we finished the chips and salsa they brought over more saying they wanted to give us warm chips. We did t ask and we weren't out. When the bill came turns out they had been billing us the whole time. After complaining they took it off the tab but I felt this was a sham to try and rack up the bill."}
{"text":"\"You crazy kids turn that music down!\" While I am not even close to the age of my Grandmother, I certainly felt like one Saturday night. The music was very loud and I could not hear anything that anyone at my table said. Also, I waited 20 minutes between each drink order. I do not mind waiting for food, which took almost an hour to arrive. Cause, guess what, I wasn't really there for the food. I do, however, take issue with having to wait for drinks. It is a Saturday night and I am ready to party. Not sit at a table saying, \"What did you say?\" and growing more and more impatient. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed! The set up is great and has so much potential but it was horrible from the minute my family and I walked in!! We got ignored and had to ask for a table to get cleared bc none of them were that were open! And then took awhile for our order to be taken and when someone came by she acted like WE were the burden and then came back bc she FORGOT what we said! Took the whole visit for my BF to get his other half of the drink special he ordered and apparently there was only on server on shift.. mid day.. on a Sunday.. during happy hour! Really wasn't that busy tho for such a horrible experience! I'm sad to say we won't be back bc the food was actually good."}
{"text":"Love this spot, one of my favs for fun margaritas and light bites. Bartenders are awesome and always take great care of us."}
{"text":"TOTAL ROTTEN TOMATOES.  WILL NEVER RETURN.  Have gone there off and on for awhile.  However, on Saturday night the server (who then said she was the Manager after I asked to speak to the Manager) spilled a glass of red wine on my brand new shirt.  This was after being out of Chard (not the first time either).  She came up from behind me and dumped the glass all over my left arm from the back.  i was there celebrating a friends birthday with my BF who is (was) a regular.  After spilling the wine on me instead of offering me another glass and reimbursement for a dry cleaning bill she said \"well that was your fault.\"  Hard to understand when I am sitting down, she is the server walking toward me my back facing her and dumped it from the back of me.  Then when I complained and asked to speak to the Manager she barked  have 6 witnesses) \"I am the Manager\" (scary thought).  Then she proceeds to call over 3 security guards...are you kidding me? I promptly picked up my jacket and pocketbook and headed straight out the door.  My BF then had a word with several folks there and they told him that he brings his \"riff-raff\" in there.  Really?  I have been in there several times and my daughter's friend (my daughter was also there she is 26) was working there for quite awhile.  I have a high level leadership role with a Fortune 5 company with many direct reports.  i have an advanced degree and several certifications and make in excess of 6 figures.  Riff-raff?  I take offense to that.  In summary when you are walking down AZ...keep going past this place there are plenty of other's to go to.  I have received better treatment in Murphy's Law.  I have posted on my FB and will be posting on every form of social media I know and have already shared this unacceptable experience with everyone I know.  

Good luck Modern Margarita we do not put up with this type of behavior in Chandler, AZ! I will look forward to seeing your door's close and a \"for rent\" sign posted on the door!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We always get great service and great food. Staff is friendly and on top of things. Food is generous and tasty. I will continue to dine at this location!"}
{"text":"I have never been here during the day or any other time than Cinco De Mayo, but based on the marketing from the website I was under the impression there would be more going on. By the time we arrived around 6:30, we were unable to put our name on the waiting list because there were too many people already and it was pointless trying to stand at the bar to get food. The drinks were alright and the music was fine but we left since there was no food and we didn't want to wait around. They also didn't have sangria which was disappointing. Overall it could've been planned much better and organized much better."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times and dinner once and been pretty happy with the experience all around. The criticism about not being able to order different tacos on the taco plate is valid - why do I want three of the same kind when there are all these amazing kinds to choose from?? At lunch with a couple of people? Order three different tacos and share - this is what we did for my last lunch and we all had a variety of tacos and all were good. The fried fish and crane Asada were borderline great. Quick, easy and tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a drink, 15 minutes prior to Happy Hour ending. It's hard to rate my experience here anything other than a 1, considering having not been served after sitting at a mostly empty bar for almost ten minutes with multiple bartenders walking back and forth and talking with each other/other customers. No matter the subtle hints, eye contact, etc., that we're made, we were never served and just up and left. Needless to say, we won't be going back. VB Lounge, right down the way from here, appreciated our business."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in the service, or lack of service. We went to try this place over the weekend and literally stood at the front waited to be seated for 10 minutes after multiple employees walked by and said they would be right with us. Since no one wanted to help us, we ended up going to a neighboring bar instead. Unfortunate because I was  so excited for this place! 

While we were waiting the menu looked good, lots of choices as to happy hour and variety of margaritas. The atmosphere and decor was super cute. 

When the sourness of my first visit subsides I will be trying this place again. 

Hopefully it won't be such a disappointment the second time around."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty good but the margaritas were overpriced, passable at best for flavor and had very little tequila. My first margarita was so weak that I asked the bartender for a shot so that my margarita would actually have some tequila in it. Not only did she not care that I was unhappy with the drink, but she then served me an $8 shot of tequila instead of trying to fix my drink. Our friends ordered a premium tequila in their margaritas and were charged for a shot of tequila instead of just an up-charge. Add to that the fact that this place charges for salsa refills and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Live with in walking distance. Suggested it to my daughter who was looking for a Mexican restaurant. Their server Nick was drunk.  Asked to talk to the manager or general manager.  The GM was in no rush to get to their table.  They will never eat there again.  Sorry suggested it! Should have told them to go to Blue Agave ."}
{"text":"Came here for taco tuesday and was not dissapointed. Our server Matt was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Loved coming here! They have an amazing happy hour, drinks and food. I got a prickly pear marg and it was probably one of the best ones I've ever had.  The bartender we had was amazing definitely made the experience. The drinks she made us were so good and she had the best attitude. I'll definitely be back next Sunday to watch some football!!"}
{"text":"Updated. After another nice night here with friends we noticed we were charged twice and coincidentally picked up another's persons bill....without ever authorizing or signing. We figured, no biggie we will just call and ask them to reverse it. My husband spoke to the manager and they were very nice and promised it would be handled. Well many emails and several phones calls (and about 2 weeks of this ) I grew tired of wasting my time (and $80) and called my bank to take care of it. It turns out they NEVER even attempted to reverse my charge. I was LIVID. They basically thought they would get away with charging me twice and then never fixing it...I wonder how many people they do this to? Thieves! I will never ever spend a fine of my money there ever again.

And the food and service isn't that great anyway. Good luck people."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and the food tasted really good but the service was poor. Part of me feels like we just had a bad server. 

We had a large party here and the she did not inform any of us about all day happy hour on Sundays. 

I asked for salt on a margarita I ordered and didn't get it. I also ordered tacos and she didn't offer any kind of tortilla other than flour. I eventually found out they offered corn and would have preferred this had she offered it. 

I'll probably come back and give it a 2nd chance if I have friends that are coincidentally going there but it was a bad first impression."}
{"text":"Friendly server, but the food was mediocre at best. Carne asada tasted/had the texture of liver, and the pork tacos were inedible."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, but, this last visit was not up to what I had experienced before. 
Came with my daughter who was visiting from Texas. Seat yourself sign was up, so we sat outside. Sat at least 10 minutes before anyone came to remove previous customers payment and wipe off table. The waitress who seemed to be handling our section, completely ignored us, not once was there eye contact and spent a lot of her time chatting with the customers in the booth right behind us. 
A nice guy, Luis, stopped and took our drink and food order, though I don't think he was in charge of our section. 
Our drinks came out and they were fine. Food came out a while later, but, we did t have any silverware or napkins. I had to go up to the bar to ask for silverware and napkins. The food was good, but, nothing spectacular. I was surprised to discover that they charge you for their salsa that they bring with your chips! The only time the section waitress came to our booth was to bring us the check. I made sure Luis got the tip.
I guess all I can say I probably won't return as we both felt ignored and forgotten among all the other customers."}
{"text":"I come for the carne asada tacos, endulge in the plethora of margarita flavors (hefe... Do you know what the word \"plethora\" means?) and if that wasn't enough I typically find myself googly-eying any one of the north scottsdale cougars that frequent city north!  Gotta stop typing my food just showed up and it's becoming really tough to writefghhhvvddrgvb"}
{"text":"Hmmm... I don't know how I feel about this place.

I came here on Saturday night around 8:00pm, as expected they were pretty busy. We were told the wait time was around 30 minutes, so we put our names down and found seats at the bar. We figured we could have a drink and look over the menu so by the time we're seated we're ready to order. 

The menu, however, was kind of strange! Only 2 entrees? a burger and a hot dog... what? I was so looking forward to an enchilada or something. They also don't have desserts listed, which in my opinion is a no-no because most people won't think to ask or won't want to.

For my meal I ordered the Grilled Fish tacos which were supposed to come with \"Grilled Mahi Mahi with Pico de Gallo, Spiked Aioli, Cilantro / Onion / Cabbage\". I asked for these with simply \"no onions\" and when my tacos came I was served fish fillets and aioli sauce. WHERE WAS THE REST OF IT?? I would have asked my waitress that question, but she never came back to check on us!

We also ordered one of their 60oz margaritas which is pretty much a glorified bowl of ice! There were two of us and I barely caught a buzz off of it. Waste of money IMO. We inquired with the bartender about whether \"The Clooney\" or \"The Conquistador\" was better and he basically talked us out of the latter because \"it's hard to make.\" So weird!

I'm not sure if I would go back, which is a shame because the overall vibe/decor is nice, but the experience left us both just very dissatisfied and confused."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and had the veggie taco & chicken taco...quite yummy!  Reservations a little hard to come by on open table, it seems, but maybe that's a testament to its popularity :)"}
{"text":"AWFUL! We have been here MANY times and have spent hundreds of dollars here. Matt is the best bartender around because he is a personable, hard worker who is AMAZING at his job. Tonight was a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT with someone named RICK behind the bar who boasted that he is the owner. Our skinny margaritas this time were LOADED with ice (see photo) & when my friend asked for less ice on our second round, Rick said that that's the way they do it and they should never do it differently. REALLY???? We were shocked!!! $10 per glass of ICE!?!? Again, see the photo. Shame on you, RICK. Matt is amazing and he puts half the ice in. Upon asking where our regular bartender Matt was, Rick became agitated, said he was the owner, and angrily proclaimed that Matt is making him lose money. What a horrible thing to say! Especially when your drinks are 90% ice and his are actual \"normal\" drinks. We will never EVER come back to this establishment because Rick is completely incompetent in dealing with his customers and we do not want to support him. He was rude and cheap even on a Tuesday when it was dead. Matt should find a better place to work and WE will find a better place to spend our money on High Street...easily done. Rick was the rudest person we have ever encountered in a business we used to frequent and to find out he was the owner was shocking. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE! Go across or down the street for better drinks, service and to support great local businesses. NOT this one who's owner who doesn't care about his customers."}
{"text":"Did happy hour with some girl friends and had a wonderful time! The margaritas were strong, the quesadilla was delish and our server was really funny. If you have the choice, I recommend sitting outside."}
{"text":"Margaritas were horrible. Had to send back my drunk for another margarita. And of course the bartender rolled her eyes when I said I didn't like it. The second margarita wasn't much better. Then we all waited (5 of my gfs) 45min for our tacos to be maid. The waitress said they shared the kitchen with la Bocca next door and the kitchen was backed up. If it took 45min to get food on a Wednesday night I can't imagine how long it would take for drinks on a weekend night. Now, none of this was the waitress fault. 100% the kitchen, bartender and manager in that evening (which we never saw). We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, not as busy as other places in the area but food was good...our server was really helpful and great!"}
{"text":"Last night, I enjoyed a fun evening at modern margarita.  When we arrived, there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table so we put our name down and proceeded to sit outside on their patio while waiting. It was happy hour and the rustic margarita I had was great. We were called to our booth and our waiter took really good care of us. Unfortunately, the kitchen seemed to be really backed up because it took our food forever to come out. After all the wait, the food was just ok: the shrimp salad had a great dressing, but the shrimp themselves were really overcooked and dried out and the grilled fish on my fish tacos were also overcooked. The drinks were great, our server was friendly, but the food was lackluster. I would suggest this place to go for happy hour and enjoy their drinks and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disappointing and ridicules expensive for value received. Arrived at 6:00 informed we were there for Happy Hour until 6:30 advised Margaritas were $3.00 off during happy hour. Placed our order for two Margaritas requested an Avion Tequila waitress did not indicate the Tequila request would void the Happy Hour pricing.  The drinks were so small it literally took seconds to finish. The glasses are so small 8oz max once filled with ice the volume of drink in less than 4oz. ordered two more prior to 6:30 because its Happy Hour what the heck. Ordered Grilled Fish Tacos and Shrimp Tacos. Rice is Uncle Bens white rice no flavor. Taco's were OKAY! Not great just okay. The salsa frankly is the best part of the entire meal. When the bill comes imagine our shock when our Happy Hour Drinks cost $64.00 that right $14.00 each plus $2.00 each for the named Tequila. Thats $16.00 per drink. Total dinner cost $101.00 When I asked waitress she says yea gee sorry I didn't know that until the bill printed out sorry..... Avoid this place ripoff.... food is so so drinks are small and way to costly for what is received. Predict they will not survive."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that this is a very loud bar type atmosphere... Margaritas were good and the tacos were ok but overall, this place is overpriced for what you actually get."}
{"text":"Apparently \"modern\" margarita means that it is piled with ice and gone in 5 sips. Also, the meat was very salty, which always make me suspicious of the quality."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time.  We are part time residents and I was super excited for a new restaurant close to our home.  It was a Monday evening  just before end of happy hour and we walked right in. The decor is beautiful and very open.  I am a designer so I love to look and review all sorts of interiors.  They have done a great job with the ambience and color as well as the layout of the space between indoor and outdoor.  After sitting down at our table no wait staff even looked our way.  I finally approached the hostess (very pleasant) and asked if we could get a menu.  She brought the menus and we quickly asked if we could order chips and salsa, a yoga martini, draft beer and a diet coke for my son.  She seemed surprised to have to put in an order for us she would put the order in but told us she would get our waiter.   After 15 min our chips, salsa and alcohol drinks showed up but not my sons drink.  Waiter said he would be right back with it.  It took another 10 min for his drink. Really 10 min!  We watched the bar tender and he wasn't busy preparing drinks just doing some dish washing.  The flight salsas and the chips were very good.  The chips were homemade and very thin.  Yum!  We ordered 2 orders of shrimp tacos and one order of chicken tacos.  The tacos were very good however being there with 2 men the serving size was much too small.  No sides with them either.  More like tapas size.  Overall the food was pretty good and the margarita was good just way too much ice. The service was not good enough this time and really I don't like the excuse that they just opened.  Don't open if you are not ready to be great!   We will definitely come back to try again on our next trip so hopefully they will have worked through all of their service kinks.  And, maybe figure out a dessert menu."}
{"text":"I come here for the Hot Mango Margarita. Absolutely love it. The fish tacos are yummy too. Great place for a quick drink and bite to eat."}
{"text":"Modern Margarita is a really good spot for anyone that works around City North or the Desert Ridge area

They have really good salsa, guacamole and tacos- you can get a sampler platter with like 16 tacos if you cant decide which you want to try. 

They also have a really good drink selection for those tough days on the job. 1 knock I have on them is their slow service- which is due to their small kitchen. 

Other than that I would recommend this place to anyone that likes good tacos!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get drinks with friends. Love the patio when the weather is nice. Great place for cocktails or tequila."}
{"text":"We have now become regulars at Modern Margarita because it is so fantastic. Their happy hour is second to none. You MUST try the agave glaze wings and \"Casa\" margarita, frozen. Other menus items to try (really, we've almost tried everything and it's SO good): quest, salsa flight, any of the tacos, and their HOUSE MADE tequila. They don't skimp on drinks or service! Our wait staff has been stellar and we look for excuses every week to come here. Support this business and if you're in the area, GO! They are amazing!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXCUSE FOR A RESTAURANT. Honestly I don't complain much and I never write negative reviews but this was an all time low. Let me start by saying we were walked right back to the worst table in the house, the atmosphere was so cool, and the patio really nice, yet somehow we got escorted to a tiny table near the bathrooms. I got whiffs of the bathrooms every time the doors opened and closed. I asked if we could sit outside and was told \"no sorry this is all we have.\" She didn't even offer to have us wait a few minutes while they cleared a table.

It gets worse. We were not acknowledged for about 25 minutes and once we were we ordered chips, salsa, and guac, and gacos. Over an hour later we still had not received a damn thing. Not even an apology or an acknowledgement from the server. When my husband finally asked, she said oh the kitchen is making the chips. (Really? In a Mexican restaurant?) sounds like you forgot to order them. (P.s they charge for chips, salsa and guac..not cool). Finally after about an hour and a half the food came out and I wish we would have walked out of this place. The carne asada tacos were so disgusting I had to spit them out in my napkin..pure fat..hard meat, awful. The fish tacos were decent but noting. Great and the salsa sucked, overall it could not have been a worse experience. The only thing the waitress did do was comp the 3 dollar chips at the end, Thanks.

Loud music bumping, inexperienced servers, unprofessional service, horrible food. I'll be shocked if this place survives another 6 months."}
{"text":"Great drinks and bartenders, but that's where it ends. Hostess stand and table staff too slow. People waiting outside and multiple empty tables unbussed outside. Saw one couple steal a dirty table. Hostess noticed and did nothing, which caused an argument with the server. Very unprofessional. Give them time, they might improve."}
{"text":"This was our second visit- the  first was for a fundraiser!  We sat outside and Katy was our server.  I  could not have asked for better service, margaritas and Mahi Mahi tacos (go fried on those).  Great atmosphere and great service by Katy - she is so wonderful!  We will be back very soon- oh cheese dip too:) Jen"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff.  Kati is one of the managers and was awesome!  Good tacos, salads and drink and a nice addition to D.C.!"}
{"text":"I really liked Modern Margarita. I had chicken tacos on corn tortillas. They were very good. I think the only thing I would change would be if they had a green sauce instead of red. My friend had chicken nachos and said they were great. The nachos were also huge. Worth the cost. We had chips and guac and salsa. I really enjoyed the salsa. But perhaps the best thing was The Clooney. It was a margarita with George Clooney's tequila. I'm not a huge marg drinker as I don't really like tequila. It was one of the best Marge I've ever had."}
{"text":"I purchased two Groupons for this place and had two pretty different experiences. 

The first time, my boyfriend and I ordered two types of tacos on flour tortillas, chicken and grilled fish. They were both just ok, and seemed rather bland. We also each had a couple margaritas. They weren't bad tasting, but the problem is that they are served in a rather small 12oz glass and MORE than half of the drink is ice. I like ice, but when you're paying $8-12 for a drink that is mostly ice, that is really not cool. Good thing this meal was essentially half price with the Groupon! The server was fine, but not outstanding.

Our second visit was last night, and was pretty frickin' great (but NOT because of the drinks). We had a different server this time, who enthusiastically greeted us and claimed \"everything's awesome here\". \"We shall see.\", I thought to myself. I had the Blueberry Smash margarita ($10) and the b/f had The Clooney margarita ($12). Both tasted fine, but again, there is really not much to them. At that price, it should be much, much bigger. I drank mine so fast, the server made a joke about how much I liked it. Yes, I liked all six sips of it! Hahaha... Anyway... the food really wowed us this time. We got the chicken tacos and nachos with carne asada. The tacos were MUCH better this time and in addition to the cabbage, had tomato and corn, which I'm pretty sure was forgotten somehow the first time. Very tasty. I don't think it's worth the $11 price tag, but the $7 happy hour price is reasonable. By far, the best thing we had was the nachos. HUGE portion, the chips were house made and delicious, plenty of tender carne asada, tomato and Mexican crema. The cheese sauce they use though... is to die for. I kinda hate that phrase \"to die for\", but it really was. I asked the server if it was house made and had beer in it. He confirmed that it was and did have beer in the recipe. There wasn't a whole lot of it on the top portion, but down into the nachos there was a good amount. It was kind of like rediscovering the nachos, since most of the time, the top is the most coveted part. These nachos are the main reason we're sure to return (at happy hour, so we can get some chicken tacos as well). We're probably going to skip on the margs though unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Everything was overpriced and the food mediocre. The margarita was tiny and tasted watered down, not what I would expect from a $9 margarita. The veggie and pork tacos, priced for taco Tuesday special, were not even worth it. The food lacked flavor and left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and it was amazing!  The food was fresh and delicious, including the fish bowl modern margarita.  Our server, Katie, had some great recommendations and provided great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great margarita but the basic service was horribly lacking almost seemed like he was on something - I'm sure not but just not with it!  The food was decent nothing to write home about but most disturbing. It was dirty!   The booth, the floor and the bathrooms and you know what they say........look at the bathroom to see how the kitchen is kept!  And the bartender......stop flirting with the guests and pay attention......there's a lot you can be doing!"}
{"text":"Food is trendy and delicious! Tons of different drink options, obviously a good number of them are versions of margaritas. Go to the all day happy hour on Sundays, sit on the patio.

I didn't give it 5 stars because the service is really bad, they are not rude or anything like that though. It just takes SO long to get someone to take orders. My advice is, don't be in a rush, go with people or a person that you want to hang out with and try to not be annoyed that you've been sitting there for 10 mins and nobody had asked if you want a drink."}
{"text":"If you like terrible ridiculous really loud music with really bad service... Then this place is definitely for you. The bandanas might be tied to tight to the bartenders heads because they completely forgot about my wife and I. The chips and salsa were good though as well as the Modelo. Didn't stick around to see if anything else was good though because I couldn't here myself think."}
{"text":"Super great atmosphere and décor. We got the grilled fish, fried fish, and shrimp street tacos. SO GOOD and filling. I had the Hot Mango margarita... Ok actually like four because they were that good. I can't wait to come back here"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying out modern margarita on high street. Stopped in about  2:40 pm on a Friday sat in a booth across from the bar. There were a few other tables eating at the time and one or two people at the bar. It's small inside with cute decor and the patio looks like a lot of fun. However, we walked out at 3pm never having been acknowledged by a single person on staff. :("}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or your time. Super disappointed. Horrible service, food less then mediocre. There were only 6 tables, I had to bus my table. We were only non-white people, not sure if that was factor. Taco plate definitely not worth $11. We ordered chicken tacos, veggie tacos, green Chile burger and flautas. So, we tried a variety of items. Not a lot to choose from. Not worth it. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Happy hour is fantastic at Modern Margarita! I've been several times, it wonderful to sit outside on the patio area. They serve chips and salsa with 3 varieties of salsa. The margaritas as delicious; I love the prickly pear on the rocks."}
{"text":"Super Selection of #Margaritas! Had the crushed strawberry and blueberry marg. First sip~ straight to my head. Get a DD like me and you are good to go. Servers are friendly and helpful when it comes to waiting on you and providing recommendations. I had a Groupon and my bill was soooo much less than I expected! $25 bucks~ salsa, queso, 2 margaritas, the fish and carne asada taco platters, with a  side of the Mexican sour cream! YUM! Atmosphere~ has an L.A. Vibe~ casual yet trendy. Make it happen and try it out!"}
{"text":"Only went to this place because of the Groupon. Service was okay. Food was alright. Didn't try any alcohol drinks. Won't be going back.

House salsa - Not great. Like marinara meets salsa. Appealing because it's almost there, but disappointing overall.

Queso - Disgusting. Was more like cheese dip for pretzels.

Carne asada tacos - Pretty good. I got the corn tortillas and would have preferred two per taco in order to avoid them breaking and spilling. Also, limes would be nice. Overall, flavor was great, but was more like a cross between machaca and carne asada.

Beans and rice - They were alright. Nothing special.

Fish Tacos - Not good. Fish was extremely dry. There was a tastey sauce, but not enough to fully enjoy it with the other flavors. Again, no limes.

Iced tea was great :)"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio which is large and doesn't face a busy street like many other Phoenix patios. Has a nice quiet view of the streets and the vast desert that appears to look like an ocean from far away.  Good service here with a fair happy hour.  Food is more on the fancy/gourmet side."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Modern Marg for a pre event happy hour. The bar itself is comfortable, with big cushy bar stools. The bartender was friendly and efficient, though his descriptions of the drinks were a little lacking (I asked which of the happy hour margs he would personally get and he replied ' uh, if you want agave nectar get this one... etc, not answering the question, just naming the ingredients, which I already knew). I had the Modern Margarita, which really tasted like tequila on ice. This was ok, especially for only 5$, but not the tastiest marg by any means. The husband had the Victoria beer on tap. The bartender was enthusiastic about this beer, so that was nice, and with good reason, because it was exceptional. We also had the salsa flight, which was very good and satisfying. The smoky salsa was tasty, almost like a bbq salsa, but the best of the three was the pico, which was just the right amount of spicy for a pico and tasted very fresh. The tomatillo salsa was lacking, not amazing. The salsas came with the largest basket of chips I have seen in a long time. We felt like we ate a full bag of chips, and the basket was still half full (yes, I am an optimist). This place is way out of my usual 'hood, so clearly it isn't a place I would frequent, but if they are in your 'hood, I would check them out for happy hour."}
{"text":"So I heard that they just opened and I really wanted to check them out. 

We came on a Friday night. It was pretty busy but I think we got lucky and we got a seat right away for the three of us. I ordered the Sandia Rita. This was quite tasty. Not too strong. I also ordered the carne asada tostadas. This was good but a bit spicy for me. And I think they put too much lettuce on it. If you look at my picture it looks like a salad on a tostada. You won't be able to see any of the other ingredients on there. 

I thought the food was good, but it was really loud inside. And I don't like that they charge you for every little thing. For example, you will usually get free chips and dip. But if you end up wanting more salsa, they'll charge you $4. My fiancé also wanted ranch for his fries, and they wanted to charge him $2! What!? Our waitress ended up giving it to us for free. Now that's good customer service. Everything is really spicy here. My entree was spicy, my fiancé got the Fantasma dog which was spicy, and so was the salsa with chips, so beware!!"}
{"text":"Our family went here for my husband's birthday dinner on a Friday night. Yes, it was busy, and yes that should be expected, but the guy takes our order and 40 minutes later we get our food. My husband's tacos were cold, their quesadillas are awful, but that could also be because it likely sat around for some time. Extremely small place, not a lot of room to move around, and definitely not a place that can seat a large party, although we only had 6 people with us, so I don't know that you could consider that to be a large party. Salsa and queso dip were the best thing about this place. If I were ever to go again it would likely just be for drinks with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Love love love! Can't wait to go back! My husband shared the taco flight with a friend and was in heaven!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner here this past Saturday night .. made reservations online for a party of 8, had to change the time of the reservations.. spoke to Grace who graciously worked with us to fit us in.. when we arrived she had the table all ready for us.. they had a great DJ in the front of the restaurant which we could hear in the back without having to scream over the music .. we had a great server who immediately took our drink and appetizer order .. they have a wonderful variety of margaritas served frozen or on the rocks.. I had the frozen watermelon  margarita and it was sooooo good .. we ordered chips, salsa and queso.. all of the apps were delicious .. the chips were served hot , the queso and salsa were also excellent .. for our meal, we ordered a variety of tacos, quesadillas and even a salad.. everyone loved the food !!! Our waiter did not miss a beat.. kept the water glasses filled, cocktails  going and checked on us several times.. (sorry I forgot his name but young nice guy with blonde hair).  Even Grace (assistant mngr) came and checked on our group.. we had a fantastic time at Modern Margarita and will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, margaritas were excellent, and the atmosphere on the patio was amazing.  Laid back, casual, and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I came to Modern Margarita for dinner. It was pretty busy on a Tuesday night and we waited 5-10 minutes for a table. Service and food were both just okay, but expensive for what you get. The chips and rice were terrible but the dips were all pretty good. Margaritas were okay - we had a fishbowl margarita to share and it was good enough to keep sipping on, but not that strong. I thought the food was expensive for the mediocre flavors and quality. 

For example, it was an additional $3 to add mushrooms and zucchini to a burrito bowl but I could barely find a few bites of the mix. It was $8 to add four shrimp which were completely overcooked and had no flavor. I might come for margaritas with coworkers but I don't think I'd be back otherwise."}
{"text":"Modern Margarita has a lovely happy hour....here is my happy hour specific review:

Patio:  great patio for groups! The area is fenced in but doesn't block the outdoor experience that is so nice in the Arizona sunshine.  

Food: The happy hour menu can be found here:  http://www.modernmargarita.com/menus/ModernMargarita-HappyHour.pdf

I recommend starting with the $3 chips and salsa flight or $3 beer-battered onion rings (at those prices you can't go wrong!) The veggie and steak tostadas are only $4!  I seriously make a meal out of the happy hour menu 

Crowd:  The crowd can be a mixed bag-- there are some sketchy cougars prepartying for Blue Martini (that place is a sh@tshow), working professionals, and locals.  

Staff: our server was a total peach and didn't complain about splitting the bill.  The bartenders gave my small group free shots when we told them we were celebrating a new job!  Most importantly, the manager offered to charge my iphone!  It was much appreciated!  

We will be back again very soon for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went here after work with my fiancée.  The fish tacos were old, smelled and tasted fishy. Not a great place for food."}
{"text":"Come here strictly for the margaritas and tacos. YUM! Gets pretty packed here on their busier nights so be prepared to wait a little for your table (or a seat at the bar). Service is good and food is consistent. When you're done head across the street to Blue Martini for additional drinks and dancing!"}
{"text":"Great Taco Tuesday specials. 3 tacos for $6. The pork tacos are AMAZING & so are the Carne Asada tacos! The nachos are also a MUST TRY, they are huuuuge! I work right across the street so the fast service is perfect for a quick lunch break!"}
{"text":"I always go here for before dinner drinks. The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly. The food is awesome too. I love the salsa."}
{"text":"Great drinks and really good tacos, but the price is always a shock. The quality of drinks and relaxed atmosphere aren't always worth the high price tag."}
{"text":"One star for the chips, one star for the ambiance...that's it! 

Met some friends here for dinner after hearing about how great this place was. Totally disappointed with my margarita and my food. Margarita tasted like sugar water with tequila. Ordered chicken tacos, beans and rice. Chicken looked and tasted like dark meat. Not impressed. 

Like I mentioned, the chips were pretty good. 

My advice:
Spend about $10 more and get a meal 100 times better at The Mission."}
{"text":"Wally was the best! We asked for surprise drinks and he made us 5 unique cocktails that were SUPERB. I didn't think I was a tequilas girl before this but I am a fan now! Thank you Wally! 

Great way to spend my 30th bday. Thank you Wally!"}
{"text":"good spot in city north which is a dead zone for businesses. They do a good happy hour with food and drink specials. Has a decent beer selection and a fun outgoing crowd. Lots of nice looking ladies. Keep up the good work Julian."}
{"text":"I came here with friends for the first time last night. It was a great night to be out: weather was perfect, the place has a lot of life, and the taco flight!!!! Oh, the taco flight!!!! Five different kinds (3 each): fish (lightly fried), carne asada, pork, chicken and vegetarian. I didn't try the carne asada. My three friends and I ate every last one. My personal favorite (and surprisingly) was the vegetarian - so much so that I had a craving this morning and after running some early errands I stopped by at 11 when they opened to get some more. They are ridiculously good. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms...and zucchini, to me, is pretty pointless but adding the goat cheese, pickled onion, avocado crema and cilantro/lettuce mix spoke to me. Hell, it was screaming at me, COME BACK! YOU KNOW YOU WANT US!!! What's a hungry woman to do but courteously oblige? No regrets. 
Last night, we had the chips and salsa and a side of guacamole. The guacamole was good enough, but I really liked the salsa. Tastes a little smoky from, I assume, chipotle chilis. I didn't think it was spicy, but my friends thought it had a zing. Today, I had a side of onion rings. Why? I can't tell you. I'm not a huge fan, generally, but once in a while my brain tells me that I like them. Well, now that the fairness disclosure is out of the way, I'll say that these were good: crunchy and not seriously oily. I didn't finish them just because... well my brain sometimes convinces me to do things that have no business being done. But if you're a fan, give them a try!
The margaritas last night: I had a Clooney, which was tasty but lots of ice and too small and then I tried a \"casa\" which was not \"limey\" enough: a little too sweet for me. The tropical iced tea I had this morning was delicious. All in all we had a great experience last night, and I look forward to coming back. Maybe for dinner! OK, brain, be quiet now. Oh, service was excellent both times."}
{"text":"Packed but great service!  Left La Bocca across the street because we couldn't get served."}
{"text":"Came here this past Sunday for all day happy hour with a friend. We had a couple of margaritas and a few appetizers off the list including:

- (complimentary) chips & salsa
- loaded fries 
- onion rings with lime aioli (except the aioli was just chipotle mayo, not lime)
- steak quesadilla 

The food was okay. We also had some margaritas. I forgot which ones we had but they were both great. They didn't skimp on the alcohol. We sat at the bar, and service was a bit slow due to the bartender, who was a sweetie, being alone. She seemed a bit stressed and was definitely spread thin when a group of 10 waltzed in and sat outside. 

Overall, I would only come back during a happy hour deal. For the quality of food we received I wouldn't feel comfortable about paying full price."}
{"text":"Too small, too crowded, too expensive. Food was marginal and so overpriced. $15 salad had iceberg lettuce. Seriously? Service was slow. Waitress didn't know what beer was on draft. My mouth tastes like an onion. Not going back anytime soon... Or ever."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service on multiple visits.  Prices and overall value are quite good on happy hour, though not so great during regular hours.  Early when this place first opened I enjoyed the really hot salsa/sauce and it was served in the standard salsa container, but now it has been switched to a little spoon sized serving.  You'd think that either the price ought to go up for a decent portion or the little spoon size ought to be a complimentary condiment.  

Tequila selection is substantial and the happy hour tequila was actually a decent tequila.  This is a notable plus because many places with upscale spirits tend to offer garbage for the happy hour drink specials.

Fair amount of eye candy too, female wise, for those that care."}
{"text":"Overpriced and under-serviced! The nachos we had were nearly inedible. Their \"famous\" fish tacos were overcooked and sort of rubbery. The miniscule salsas were very bland and our $14 margaritas were mostly ice... As many others have mentioned, service was not up to par for the prices or the atmosphere they are trying to create. My girlfriends and I are putting Modern Margarita on ice! Too much competition that cares in the area to give it another shot. Five more available seats for the fans of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous Friday afternoon lunch here. Caleb was our server and he was hopping around helping everyone. Never waited for anything. Great OG Rustic margaritas. Spicy salsa. Yummy guacamole. Nice salty chips. Fabulous tacos in either flour or corn tortillas or lettuce wraps. We enjoyed pork tacos on lettuce wraps and chicken tacos is on corn tortillas. We will absolutely be back to this new local favorite.  Thank you Modern Margarita and Caleb for a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my lady and this was super disappointing. I was so bummed man. It looked promising but, the tacos, fries, and service all were very below average. 

Maybe people just come here to drink margaritas! (Which could definitely be the case.)

I just think there are way better restaurants that you could go to before settling for here...

BB's Rating: Disappointing :/"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and I do agree- the tacos are tasty. The pork with pineapple are my favs. The guacamole is good but there is definitely better around town. My one main issue is the service. No one checks back to see if you are enjoying your meal or if you want anything else. They just seem to care about turning over your seat.  It is a tiny cramped spot but a little better service would make me want to go more. HH specials are good which has kept us going back but this last time was the absolute worst service so I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Great Fish Tacos and go buck ass zany on the chips and salsa.  Lots and Lots.... and Lots... and Lots...Lots... Lots of Tequila to pick from.... Lots.   Great vibe and the best thing is its across from La Bocca.  So its like the Bermuda Triangle between Modern Margarita, La Bocca and the Blue Martini.   You can really loose oneself... Just blame it on the Tequila"}
{"text":"Ever since I had a marg here I was hooked!!! Now whenever I go to other bars and restaurants I'm so disappointed by the margs. Love this place so much it's where I had my last birthday! It's also my go to spot for happy hour"}
{"text":"Food & service is amazing!  Best Happy Hour in Scottsdale!  Free chips & salsa, great steak tostadas & surprising awesome buffalo wings!!   This allows me to get my Mexican food fix and I can bring my wife(who hates Mexican food), she gets the wings every time and loves them!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas & food!!! No heartburn with these Margs thanx to fresh squeezed sweet n sour mix. The steak skewers & carne asada tacos are Tote delish!!!! service at tables is hit n miss... Service at the BAR is always EXCEPTIONAL, quick & friendly so if you are on a time schedule I recommend sitting there. But, I am not in a hurry so I will sit back relax & enjoy:)"}
{"text":"Good little happy hour place. Service could have used some work. Felt like they forgot about us a couple of times."}
{"text":"Great waitstaff and atmosphere.  The chips were delicious and the salsa/sauces are delicious as well.  The tacos were good as well, though not fantastic.  Prices a bit high for Mexican food, but I guess it is \"trendy\".  Not very big though.  Only been here for lunch, would be interesting to see it more packed and see how it is.
Update: I've been back and it was busier and the service level went down.  I was not impressed and wouldn't go back.  The tacos were a bit better even this time than last but not worth it."}
{"text":"We had reservations for noon for a large group of 13.  They were not ready table want set up.  Service was slow despite them not being that busy.   Our drinks sat empty. Our food didn't come out till after 1.  I got the grilled fish tacos and they were dry.  It was a lunch we needed to get back to work.  I would not go back."}
