{"text":"Friendly service 5/5.  Delicious food 4/5.  Made falafel fresh to order and passed out samples to those behind standing hungrily in line.  Friends and patrons waving and calling in on their way by.  Food is fresh and tasty, some dishes are a little salty but I'm not complaining. all in all really clean, well run joint.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"The restaurant is perfect and clean that's why I invite my friend there and the service Is fast especially there is guy called  Mohammed he is awesome and kind"}
{"text":"The place looks sketchy in front, but the food is solid and the staff were friendly and even helpful when I asked for some directions. Bonus: they take credit"}
{"text":"Great place! The spice on the chicken shawarma is amazing! Daily cheap specials are the icing on the cake"}
{"text":"Fantastic shawarma plate and shish tawook, literally addicted to them. The prices are reasonable too. They pack your box with salads, rice, meat and hummus topped by the sauces. If you have a big appetite, this place is for you. Big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Good portion. Nice hosts. Various tastes. Relaxing environment for dining in. I am happy to recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So good and at reasonable price! The quarter chicken leg is the best! 5/5 recommend! If you are a student you get 15% off. The price you pay is worth for how much food you get. Also the employees are friendly and fast at preparing your food. Should definitely try it out if you are hungry and need some good food near Dundas and Bay!"}
{"text":"Don't judge the food based on the 3 star rating I gave to this establishment.  I would rate the food 4.5.  It was tasty, and fresh.  But I did taste a bit of sand.  It's not overwhelming but a few of the sand molecules went to my taste buds.  I would think the sand came from the green vegetable which weren't thoroughly washed.  As for how I rate it 3 it's because the establishment could use some new paint.  The walls, have few scratches, cracks and stains.  The ceiling tiles could use some new ones.  The sign out side is not pretty.  I was just referred by a colleague her for Shawarma but he himself has not tried it.  When I look at this from the outside.  Looks like crumbling food store in disrepair or in need of maintenance.  I was thinking, forget it, this place is 'ghetto'.  But I saw a couple of people ordering so this place must still be doing something right.  So I went ahead and ordered the special of the day  Shish Tawook, which is 2 dollars cheaper then regular.  It's not a bad deal.  The servers were nice, and the service was quick.  Again, the food was great, just need to throughly wash the vegetables so I won't taste any sand.  Also it just need improve or repair/repaint the interiors and exterior of the restaurant.  I'm sure once it's done, and they maintain the food quality, they will get more customers."}
{"text":"Great food at this place, was unexpected, doesn't look like much when you're about to walk past it...\"never judge a book by its cover\" certainly applies here. While across the street, the Asian culinaries are seriously busy with lines outside their door, yet, this quite, unassuming place will satisfy your taste buds and will leave you full. The best part, the one man band staff was extremely helpful, no joke, I wasn't too familiar with the menu, in terms of mix-n-match for my rumble in tummy, but he helped give me a tasteful dish that I thoroughly enjoyed. I had the chicken and beef kebabs. And even took a Shish kebab wrap back to the hotel. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I had to sum up this place in a few phrases, it'd be: solid food, low prices, big portions, friendly service.  I usually get the chicken shawarma platter and have found it to be one of the more consistent items on the menu. The beef shawarma can be a hit or miss - sometimes the meat is cooked perfectly and is super tender; sometimes it's really chewy, overcooked, and bland. Since the last time I came, they've updated the menu with a bunch of new options, such as lamb. The hot sauce isn't as flavourful as Doner Kebab House on Yonge, but it's enough to give the dish a bit of a kick.  There are also daily specials that are super cheap (off the top of my head, I remember seeing a quarter chicken combo for less than $6 on Wednesdays) but the regular items on the menu are inexpensive too.   Overall, while this isn't the best shawarma place I've been to in Toronto, it's certainly an excellent option if you're in the area. It's a good place to pick up food if you're on the go."}
{"text":"It's hard not to be a creature of habit and just go to places that you are familiar to eat. Eating out is costly and the last thing people want to do is to go to a place and be disappointed about it.   That's why finding places like Shish Kabab Express is great. We were in the area and were looking for a quick eat. We came upon this place through Yelp and decided to take a chance. The outside is not much to talk about. Looks a bit shady to be honest. Once inside, you go to the front to order, cafeteria style. Prices were not cheap but reasonable based on the area. There are limited seating available, roughly no more than 16 people.   There's different options to choose including daily specials but we chose to go with the platters. We chose the Beef and Chicken Shawarma platters along with the Lamb Shank platter. They give you a choice of brown or yellow rice along with salad. Prices ranged from $12 to 14 for the 3 platters. Portions were large. The lamb, chicken and beef were delicious. All of the meats were not dry at all. Beautifully done. Rice was also good and the only thing that was average was the salad. There's also an option to put a hot sauce which can kick up a few notches. Be warned!   The place play Arabic music and we went a little bit after 1pm and it was steady but not busy.   Don't let appearances stop you from coming here especially if you love this type of food.   Recommended. #1 of 2018"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the non-descript decor and surroundings. It looks like a dump of a shawarma place, but the food is no joke. Two shawarma plates was $16 and can easily feed 2 hungry people or more. All the toppings and meat were very fresh, tasty and provided in great quantities. Thank God for Yelp! I never would have discovered this hidden gem otherwise. Will definitely be going back very soon."}
{"text":"I cannot count how many times I have been here. I work nearby and this is hands down the best bang for your buck middle eastern place I have ever seen. It's in downtown too conveniently located near Dundas Station.   Outside you will see signs for daily specials. $5.99 falafel plates? Wow. Their daily specials are cheaper than Zeytouna and Alibaba just a little west. Selections are more or less your standard shawarma plate/wraps, with falafels and a few appetizer options. They also have fish which is not too common for a middle eastern place.  With such low prices, you might question the quality. To my surprise, the food is very decent. Sure if you come at the wrong times the rice might be a little dry, but their shawarma and falafels are solid. Portions are massive! Ask for extra tahini sauce. They are not stingy!  I don't like kebob skewers that are not fresh to order and sitting in liquids (like ali baba). Stick with your shawarma and falafel plates and you won't be disappointed.   Like the majority of middle eastern places, it's not so nice to sit inside. The open kitchen concept makes the store pretty hot. So just get take out and eat somewhere else more comfortably. But this place will be feeding me for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"The food is OK. I ordered a \"mixed\" shawarma (which is chicken and beef in one wrap) and i was charged extra even though there was no extra meat. I have eaten so many shawarmas and this is the first time I have been charged for this. Also it's not fun to pick inedible pieces of cartilage out of your mouth and after biting into the sandwich. The people working there are rushing as fast as possible, and don't seem to care if you get your sandwich or someone else's. Next time I will go to Ali Baba's - the workers there are very friendly."}
{"text":"Got the Beef Shawarma and chicken around 6pm (well before closing). Chicken was decent but nothing special. The Beef Shawarma was burnt. A few pieces were over done but beef like in texture, some of the pieces were pan fried fat while most of the pieces of meat were thin and charred - crumble into powder when you bite into it. Would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Very good value and a very welcoming place.  This is my new favourite on the Dundas corridor."}
{"text":"One of my favourite shawarma joint on Dundas. Portions are huge, food is cheap, and very quick service. They actually cut the shawarma fresh from the grill not like some other places that used pre-cooked meat from the container. The only thing I don't like about this place is the dine-in area which is too cramped and heated from the kitchen. Otherwise, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Totally worth a visit. Got the special 2x Shish Tawook. Toppings are above average and chicken was a bit dry but decent. Service is friendly, prices reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"Underrated item: lentil soup.  Under $3 for relatively large bowl of soup, with lentils and potato pieces, higher tier than Tim Hortons soups in flavour and quality, in my opinion. But be prepared to be thirsty afterwards cause it's a little salty.  Get it with their wrap/item of the day and you got a nice lunch for under $10!"}
{"text":"Very good food and for a good price. The shish kebab wrap is kinda like a arabic burrito. Very good flavors and food."}
{"text":"Late night shawarma spots in Toronto are a dime a dozen. In places like this it's all about the customer service.   Tonight I came into this place expecting just what I'd get at most other local spots - and that's what I wanted. Fresh, tasty chicken with warm pita and some goodies stuffed inside for a shawarma sandwich. This is precisely what I got. The sandwich was tasty, the falafel was fresh/moist, and I got a few things to go.   But what really draws me to want to return here is the friendly service. Where I usually get no more than a \"what do you want\" - here I had a long conversation with a friendly young man behind the counter. He packed up my food, wished me well, and sent me on my way.  These are the things we expect from sit down restaurants but get so infrequently from smaller and faster spots. I would highly recommend patronizing this place. Taste the chicken :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable Arabic food in the heart of downtown Toronto? Believe it.  The falafel here is as good as anything you'll get on the streets of Beirut or Jerusalem, and it's really nice to have the option of brown rice if you don't want white rice.  Smiling, happy owners and workers, too -- that's always a good sign!"}
{"text":"I walk by this place everyday to go to work and always wanted to try it. Initially when it first opened, they had some pretty cheap deals like $3.99 for a 1/4\" chicken meal or shawarma. Perhaps that was just an intro price as they slowly increased it. The time I went it was $4.99, which is still a pretty good deal. When I saw it last week, it looked like they had new signage out with daily specials and like an increase in regular pricing again.  With that said, for the 1/4\" chicken meal that I did purchase, it was a pretty juicy piece of chicken. Definitely not try as most places might do when it all the pieces just sit there to be reheated. But this was unexpectedly good and came with rice and salad. My only qualm was that it was a bit oily but that could be from the chicken fats or oils in their marinates.  I wouldn't mind trying this place again and hope it doesn't degrade in quality over time."}
{"text":"Really delicious falafel and shawarma here! SO GOOD, you can add the fillings you want and it's made to order. Chicken and beef are good. Really hits the spot. The service is also super friendly too."}
{"text":"This is a office favorite due to their great deals, convenient location and friendly staff. I took advantage of the Monday special (2 chicken shawarma wraps for $10.99) and can see why people love this place.   The staff is super friendly. We were greeted with a bite of falafel and a warm welcome. He chatted with us as he assembled our wraps and give us a good-natured hard time when we sat down but didn't have a tray.  The food itself is filling and delicious for the price. It got soggy in the last couple bites due to the sauce, but it was a great wrap overall. I didn't give them four stars because on the trip home all I could think about was water. It got to the point were I thought about it constantly until I could gulp down a whole glass and then immediately poured myself another one. I checked with my dinner partner and he experienced the same thing. Good quick cheap dinner option, but didn't enjoy the aftermath."}
{"text":"Ok, the reviews were right -  that was a really tasty schwarma and substantial portions. Liking!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Friendly. Great value. Fresh made falafel after midnight! Will return."}
{"text":"Hands down to the best shawarma in toronto. Nice recipes for the salads and the weekly specials are great. Try the chicken shawerma platter with an extra of shish tawook! The guy at the night shift (tall guy) is really friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I (first time in Canada) were hungry after a long day and we were searching for a place to eat late night after coming back to our hotel from the maple leafs game. After looking at different stores we finally decided to try here.   Mohamed was extremely helpful in helping me decide what to order. First of all, the food is really really good. I had the quarter chicken with salad, rice, and also had some chicken shawarma. The chicken was moist, tender, nice crust on the skin and it was complimented with warm hearty lentil rice. On top of that, the salad and the fixings werr perfect to cut through the food with some acidity.   Mohamed was also nice enough to let us have the lentil soup, which was bold, full of flavor, and excellent for a cold, snow-falling night. I am very sad to have found this place on our last evening in Toronto. Had we found out about this place sooner, we would have gone at least 2 or 3 times during our stay.   If you are visiting the area, this place is a very solid place for great portions, great deal, and all around bold flavors that will warm you up. Thank you Mohamed for an excellent dinner, and I wish you and your family the best of luck in everything that you do."}
{"text":"I'm usually super picky about my takeout/fast food foods (looking at you Ghazale!), but this place is FANTASTIC! The staff is super friendly (especially that lady who works there), service is decently fast, and the food is just delicious! I am yet to have a bad meal there, and something tells me that I will not have that displeasure anytime soon.  They have excellent beef samosas - at $1 they're a great mini snack. Also, they have daily deals and those prices are hard to beat for that quality of food. I tried most things at this point, but my personal favourite is still the classic Chicken Sahawarma. Nom nom. The falafel is great too. The beef I wasn't blown away by, but honestly, I do not usually like beef in my wraps so no surprise there. Definitely would recommend this place any time! And definitely check out the daily specials they have!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are reasonably priced. You can get 2 Shawarmas or Shish Taouk wraps for $10.00. Ordered the Shish Taouk wraps with all toppings (chickpeas, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles etc). They added garlic sauce, hummus and some hot sauce however it felt like something was still missing. The wrap wasn't grilled properly and was cold by the time I ate it which was 10 minutes later! This wasn't the best Shish Taouk wrap that I have had. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"An amazing hole-in-the wall place! The setting is modest but the staff and good are the best! The staff was really funny and were nice to lead us through as my group didn't know what was up.  I ended up getting the beef shishkabob platter and it was an explosion of flavor! Not one item was amiss on flavor and they melded very well together. To top it off, it was a LOT of food. Well worth the price and wish I lived closer to come here more frequently.  An absolute must visit!"}
{"text":"Took the fam here after the auto show and felt right at home as soon as we walked in the door. Food was totally fresh even after taking it on the subway and the train home to Bradford. Totally recommend this place. Family restaurant all the way."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Great daily deals. I got the Monday deal 2 falafel sandwiches for $5.99 - awesome. High recommended!!"}
{"text":"-Restaurant could use some renovation as it is small & crowded from the inside (minor concern) -Employees are friendly/polite -Portions & prices are good (you get what you pay for) -Food taste delicious (has the right amount of flavour & spice) -Would buy again & most definitely recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place and it actually is such a hidden gem!!!   For $6.99 I got the falafel plate. First of all, the portion size is insane, they give you selection of normal or brown rice and a variation of salads which makes such a varied palette. Then, the falafel. They make it fresh right in front of you! I was shocked because I've never seen that done ever and in turn the falafel is just right amount of crispy on the outside and extremely soft on the inside.   Definitely recommend if you're craving quick cheap and delicious middle eastern food!"}
