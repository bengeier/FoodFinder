{"text":"Finally got to check out Smalls after seeing/hearing about its opening in Elizabeth.    Very friendly staff and interesting lunch menu.  We got the chicken wings with a spicy Korean BBQ sauce.  Well, not sure there is anything Korean about the sauce, but the wings were yummy and appropriately spicy.  Wifey tried the crab cake slider and said it was good - substantial lump crab meat, always key.  I tried the salad with roasted NC shrimp.  The shrimp tasted very fresh and were well seasoned and roasted.  The greens were very healthy, the tomato confit added the pizzazz and the peppered buttermilk dressing was just right.  Good presentation too.  Lots of attention - I think the owner came by a few times - he MUST be a New Yahker - very intense, but in a good way.  The waitress was super nice as well.  Good overall vibe to this place.  Love the fact that it was ALL NC craft beer - booyah!  But $5 per draft?  $4.50 for OMB Copper doesn't count.  That $5 draft thingy seems to be getting more popular at the restaurants around here.  And I have a psychological barrier about it.  Please make it $4.99.  Keep it under $5.  Or offer a daily special, where one is less than $5.  I know, I know.  It's all local beers.  But, how about if it's sold as $4.50 per pint with a 50 cent NC local beer surcharge?  That's completely different than paying $5, right?  You wid me?  Ah, fuhgeddaboudit then.  Anyway, check this place out.  There were a lot of other items on the menu that make me want to come back and try it again."}
{"text":"My husband thinks this location is sort of cursed, but I convinced him to try it :) It was pretty good & we'll definitely go back.  Beef sliders - very good. My husband doesn't like mustard so we got it on the side. Fyi, they also come w/mayo which neither of us likes so we did have to send them back. The server said they're supposed to reprint the menus since mayo was left off  Fries - hand cut & seasoned well  Pan seared NC shrimp salad - really enjoyed. Next time I'll probably try it w/their vinaigrette dressing though which is usually my preference when it comes to salad dressings  Crispy chicken - I'm not a big waffle fan but it was delish! And the salted caramel butter was so good! The chicken was nice & juicy. They make it to order so it took a while to come out but I'd rather than than be served food that's been sitting.  Choc orbit cake - it was more like a mouse than cake. Neither of us were fans.   My St. Germain martini was nice & strong...strong enough for me to only have 1 :)   Service was great. Overall very good experience. Next time we'll have to try the wings."}
{"text":"This is an update to a previous review with a bump up in stars.  The original review was less complementary because I was dismissed over a discrepancy. Growing pains I suppose.   I received a personal and generous response from management. And so, after a second visit...5 stars! The food on both visits  5 stars all the way.  Still not without problems though. This second visit I ordered black and blue burger with fries, with NO bacon. As you may guess it had bacon on it.   It's a big problem for me. However, I know I am in the one percent so I did not deduct a star. Disappointed though because I ordered it with no bacon and that seems like an easy request. More growing pains?  As mentioned before somewhat expensive but good food is worth it. The price is reasonable for the quality.  Also it's great to have another restaurant on Elizabeth St. Being fine dining I don't know if they could do it, but with the location they might want to consider some quicker and less expensive options and possible delivery service.    ."}
{"text":"The name \"smalls\" refers to the restaurant's interior space, not the size of dreams or expectations you'll find once inside the doors.  A local vibe permeates the environment: the chef is a Johnson & Wales graduate and the bar serves NC craft beers.  The menu is interesting and accessible, with a few varieties of down home sliders accompanying other worldly options like chicken & waffles and handmade pasta.  Once your order gets to the table, watch out; the food is rich, developed, and flavorful.  BUT... a month after opening, there are still some service-type kinks that they haven't yet worked out.    Friday night, I called to see if a party of 3 could be seated and was told that they were filling up, but if we got there in the next 10 minutes we should be fine.  7 minutes later, we walked in the door and were told there would be a 15 minute wait.  Not that big of a deal, we went to the bar for a drink.  The bartender was very nice, but sadly couldn't transfer our drinks to the table once we were ready to be seated, so we had to close out - again, not that big of a deal.  Our waitress (unenthusiastically) told us the day's specials and then took our order... which is right about when everything fell apart.  They brought only two of our three dishes to the table, of which only one was correct.  So they then took the pimento sliders away but not-so-sneakily tried to pawn them off on the table behind us - alas, the pimento sliders were not what they'd ordered either.  Apparently, our third order had never gotten put into the system, so they scrambled to make that and finally brought out a plain burger, having prepared it so quickly that they left off all the burger toppings (cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato) that were supposed to come with it.  So, now we send a second plate back to the kitchen.  Ultimately, we finally got the right sliders and burger with all the proper fixins, but it shouldn't have to be that difficult.  However, the food was good enough to assuage those problems (it didn't hurt that they comped us the burger on our final bill too).  Assuming they work out the kinks, this place may need to be renamed Bigs, as I can see it being huge in the Charlotte restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Came in for a quicky after the food truck friday. First time, been reading about it here.  Great server Jeremy, cool set up for Charlotte , good wine, very good wings, flat bread crust was under cooked for me,  but anyway.... Crazy thing friday 9ish the place was dead ? will go back ... this is a place I want to see succeed ."}
{"text":"I ate immediately prior to my first visit to Smalls.  Why?  Because Yelp lists Smalls under the category of \"burgers\" and I was not in the market for a burger.  Shame on Yelp for this egregious mislabeling, for it kept me from experiencing the crispy chicken and thyme waffle during my first visit to Smalls.    The chicken and waffle is the best selling item on the menu, and that fact will not surprise you once you try this.  Crisp, golden skin on the fried chicken, paired with a thick waffle with butter and some delicious caramel syrup stuff.  We also had the heart of romaine salad, roasted brussels sprouts, and fried eggplant with tomato and mozzerella.  All delicious.    All beers on tap at Smalls are brewed right here in North Carolina.  I was happy to see a couple selections from NoDa (brewed by the brilliant Chad Henderson) on tap during my first visit.  Coco Loco and Midnight Madness never fail to please.    The service at Smalls is impeccable.  All servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  If you are not a fan of trying to talk over really loud, really shitty music, do not visit Smalls during the later evening hours on Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"Incredible wait staff, very attentive.  Owner greeted us out front which was a nice touch. Allowed my fianc√© to sample 3 drafts before deciding on the Noda ramble on red.  Fried pickles were a great start, burger and sliders were UNREAL.  Fries come with grated parm and are also amazing.  Seriously one of the best overall burger-and-beer-on-a-weeknight experiences we have ever had."}
{"text":"Smalls is like a breath of fresh air on Elizabeth Avenue.  Although the decor and atmosphere of the place is refreshing and deserves some attention, I must talk about the food first.  Wow. All I can say is, chicken and waffles. I didn't order this the first time I went and instead ended up stealing about half of my friend's order. Calories from friends' plates don't count right? I hope not because I couldn't stop myself from going back for more. I wanted that perfect bite-- a little of the crisp, light thyme scented waffle topped with super crispy fried chicken, and of course a little dollop of the heavenly salted caramel butter. I'm literally salivating as I write this...mmm...The only bad thing about the chicken is it takes a little longer than other items to cook (we were told by our server) so if you go for it try to have a little patience.  Believe it or not, the other menu item that really blew me away was a salad!! I've never said a salad rocks before, but this salad rocks! Each salad comes with a whole poached pear which is hollowed out a bit and filled with a butternut squash creme fraiche.  The pear sits on top of fresh arugula with a spiced citrus vinaigrette. It is so light and refreshing and really something different. You really don't expect to cut into your pear and have something luscious creamy awaiting you in the center.   Friends ordered the sliders, fried pickles, and \"Zack's Korean style wings\" which I naturally had to taste a little of each. Although I didn't get as much time to savor those dishes I still concluded that they were delicious also.  All in all, Smalls is a great place to socialize with friends, try a few little bites, in a fun non-stuffy environment. I've been waiting for a place to open on Elizabeth that doesn't cost $28 a plate for dinner.  Even if you want a larger entree you won't be breaking the bank. It feels new and exciting inside and I'm looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"So I ate there on a Sunday night. Maybe not the best night to go but I was hungry and wanted to give it a try. First of all I will say the service was great. The hostess and waitress were super friendly and good at their jobs. The issue I have with this small plate bar is the ginormous prices. $6 for a cup of fries? Are you kidding me? If you want a $10 slider you have to order a side of fries to go with it. I was expecting a huge order of fries at that price, you know enough to share and enough to feel really guilty about, but no just a cup. About what you would get at the Crepe Cellar.  My friend had the steak sandwich and it was the size of a slider, he said it was good but for the price? And some of the items are even more expensive but I did not bother to try them as I wanted to leave the night with some money left in my pocket. I had the pear and arugula salad. It sounded great on the menu and at $8 I thought it was fair. It turned out to be a pile of arugula with 4 roasted walnuts and a whole pear off to the side sitting in what may have been a balsamic reduction. There really wasn't enough of the reduction there to taste to determine for sure. And did I mention the pear was whole? The presentation was cool I will give them that but the practicality of the plate was ridiculous. Inside the pear was some of the creme fraiche but I could not mix the flavors with the salad so basically I ate arugula with a pear. I could have done the same thing at the farmer's market for about $2. The ambiance was nice but not for the price. Can CPCC students really afford to keep this place in business? Am I missing something?  I will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"My husband, some friends and I attended the Friends and Family preview last week, and were thoroughly impressed with the creative, contemporary cuisine and the nice, modern but cozy atmosphere.   The name of the restaurant matches the exterior-- we passed by it three times before we finally spotted it, wedged among the larger restaurants along Elizabeth.  Keep your eyes peeled!  For our meal, we shared the poached pear salad (Arugula, Butternut Cr√®me Fraiche, Roasted Walnuts, Spiced Citrus Vinaigrette) which was out of this world.  Imagine an adorable, soft perfectly plump pear and slightly bitter arugula and the crunch of walnuts. This was definitely a memorable salad.  (I've had enough walnut pear and Gorgonzola, thank you very much!)  Because the kitchen was backed up because of the special event, the owner, Joe was very sweet in offering us some fried pickles.  (Who doesn't love fried pickles?) They're nothing out of the ordinary, but were well executed.   Now, for the main event.   I had the 18-Hour Short Rib (Parmesan & Bourbon Creamed Corn, Whipped Garlic & Chili Infused Yukon Gold Potatoes) and yes, it was ONE rib.  Don't let this deter you, it's enough food.  Perfectly seasoned and fall-off--the-bone yummy. The creamed corn was really special too.  Slightly sweet, and cheesy, I could have eaten just the corn.   My husband had the Crispy Chicken (Thyme Waffle, Salted Caramel Butter, Chili-Infused Honey) which I had anticipated to be boring, like other chicken and waffles I've had.  But the touches like salted caramel butter and thyme infused waffle was a really nice touch and made the dish special and memorable.  The only tiny, tiny, tiny critique...the waffle could have been a bit crisper, and maybe fluffier.  Otherwise, we have a fantastic dish.    My friend across the room had the pasta, which is made in-house, and from what she said, absolutely incredible. Another friend had the eggplant starter, which looked super crisp, and really pretty.   My husband also loved the NC craft beers available.   Overall, Smalls leaves a great impression.  They're the kind of restaurant you eat at, and as soon as your done eating, are already planning your next visit and who you'll bring with you.  I think our exact words were \"...let's put this into our regular restaurant rotation\".   Well done!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, very disappointing.  Food took over a half hour, and there were maybe three tables total, and it just wasn't worth the wait.  Service was very slow.  Probably a better place to grab a drink than eat."}
{"text":"I visited Smalls on Saturday night for a belated birthday celebration and it was wonderful, truly a special experience. Right away, the owner makes you feel welcome and appreciated when you walk up the exclusive hallway into the restaurant. The decor is trendy and bright and the seating space is small to add to its air of exclusivity.    We started with the fried pickles and mussels. The fried pickles had a unique, tempura batter that made them light and refreshing with the buttermilk ranch dressing. The mussels were a smaller portion and only came with one slice of bread (ask for more of their homemade bread!) but the sauce was buttery and had the right amount of garlic (how can you go wrong with mussels..) It also had a nice touch of oven dried tomatoes that absorbed the delicious sauce so was great to eat alone.  For dinner, we had the special which was a NC triggerfish that was delicate and fluffy and came with potato pancakes that my boyfriend could have had as his meal.. but were a nice touch to the fish and roasted vegetables. We also had the 18-hour short rib which was cooked close to perfect and was topped with acarmelized gravy that tasted like something your grandmother would make. The chili infused mashed potatoes really were the star of the show. The added kick from the spice kept me addicted. The corn pudding/cheesy baked corn was a different take on the normal corn pudding and could have been a little less runny but overall the taste was right on point.  The owner brought out an amazing chocolate fudgecake as a birthday ending to the meal and was topped with a mint ice that was very intriguing.  I left feeling very comfortable, full and excited to come back again. Also, love that they they only have NC beers on draft, that is the way it should be!"}
{"text":"This place is good. The food is fixed by competent cooks. I had the crispy chicken and waffles [with a side of fries]. The meal is a little big for one person, but if you have a group, it would be perfect to share the fries. The chicken, breading, and sauce was good. Yes I did say there is sauce on the fried chicken. Its a honey infused with chili peppers type sauce. It sounds a little odd, but I can't complain. The waffles were meh.   Service: I can't complain. The server I had was warm and friend. The GM/Owner came by a few times to see how things were going, so it seems like they care about quality.   The place is a bit pricey, but the food is good.  The bad: The design of the place was nice. The art on the wall was just odd. The music was too loud. The place looks more like a club rather than a restaurant. The lead up to the place is dark, and the lighting inside is dark. If you're looking for a place for a late meal, and drinks... go here."}
{"text":"Great place great food for people who are actually foodies and know good food."}
{"text":"Just disappointing food overall - lacked the depth of flavor I expected and not hot either.  Service was competent but slow.  Lot of buzz so I expected more.  Wings weren't crispy but were a little sweeter than I expected.  Sliders were not hot and a little dry.  I will wait for the kinks to be ironed out before returning."}
{"text":"The menu looks so promising, but many items are poorly executed.  Short rib sliders were greasy and bun was cold and soggy on top from the pickle.  The lobster bisque had the consistency of water and no chunks of crab as advertised.  The server was very nice but the hosts were clueless and a little rude.  6 people and a $300 tab, not worth the money for apps and sliders."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great decor, and knowledgable staff.  One of their house specialties is their brussel sprouts.  Trust me when I say their not the kind your mother used to make us eat.  Did I mention the NC draft beer selection... Mmm."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the fact that our friends had recommended it so highly, or maybe the fact that is was beyond dead at 9pm on a Saturday night, but I wasn't such a BIG fan of SMALLS.   The fried pickles were too salty and overly breaded, and the pimento cheese slider was really underwhelming. The fries were nothing special. We were also told that the kitchen was out of a ton of items -- most of seafood.  We'll give it another try, but first impressions being important, I can't say I was falling out of my seat. Decent beer selection. I hope it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday night and we walked in at about 8:30 and got a table- the manager/owner? was very enthusiatic and very nice.   We sat down and i ordered a Margarita-with Patron -It was gross and barely any Tequila- when the bill came it said it was $16-umm are you kidding me for something that i had to choke back and barely tasted any tequila in- not worth it and honestly its still making me mad- I love Tequila and if you look throughout my reviews I have at least 1 before i go into wine so I know what I'm talking about and $16 for it is absolutely absurd. ok I will move on   We ordered French Onion soup to start along with the Short rib sliders- the French Onion was pretty bland and it needs to have MORE cheese!!! The Sliders were ok -the pretzel bread seemed like it was frozen and they microwaved them to heat them up so it was a little disappointing.   For my Entree I had the Papperdelle with Oyster Mushrooms- the pasta was ok but they put way too much sauce on it and I kept trying to figure out what it was reminding me of and it kinda was like Italian dressing- like the kind you make yourself- it was weird. He had the Crab cake sliders and Oysters- oysters were ok nothing great and the Crab sliders were again weird- they were fried so the crab was way overcooked if only they pan seared them then they would be way better!  No desert- 2 glasses of wine and our server was very nice. I feel like they rushed to get up and going- linen table clothes but paper napkins- Menus are way too big and fall all over the place. I also have to say that once again the prices for some of these items are high and don't make sense when you get the dish- i have no problem spending money on food-seeing as i eat out about 10 times a week, but make it worth the price, because if the quality isn't showing and I cant see why I'm paying so much for it then I most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"My first visit to the newly opened restaurant and overall I'd say I was impressed.  Met a fellow yelper there and started our meal with the Eggplant Stack, which was VERY good!  Perfectly cooked, slightly batter and layered with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes...YUM!  Would definitely order again!  For my meal, I ordered the Crispy Chicken that came with Thyme Waffles with salted caramel butter and chili infused honey drizzled over it.  It was very good fried chicken (on the bone, so I picked at it with a fork and it pulled right off.  The waffles were very good and the toppings were delish.. For $14 it was an ample portion I suppose, perhaps should've included another side dish for that pricepoint in my opinion.  He ordered the 18 hour beef short rib and chose fries as his side.  The beef was tender and tasted well seasoned, not being a huge beef fan, it's hard to get me too excited here, but it was definitely good.  Fries were okay, nothing to write home about and calling them \"herbed pommes frites\" doesn't really change the flavor.  While the online menu mentions two desserts, our waiter told us that there was only one and my fellow yelper had sampled it the last trip he made and wasn't impressed.  I totally trust his judgement, so we didn't try it again.  I must say i was suprised at the lack of dessert options, it seems like this would be the kind of place that would be up for the challenge of a variety of options.  The decor is hip and modern, the space is intimate and attractively decorated and the owner greeted us while were dining and seemed very friendly.  Our waiter was super helpful and patient and not too chatty and was only a glance away at all times.  For $49, I'm not sure I'd be back on a regular basis as that seems a little pricey for the offerings, but Small's has potential and hopefully with some tweaks will fair just fine in this location."}
{"text":"Smalls is now closed. http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/local/customers-say-they-were-overcharged-hundreds-dolla/nPNLm/"}
{"text":"Overcooked brussel sprouts (still tasty, but needed a few more minutes in the oven); cook/waiter forgot the cheese on my sliders; someone dropped one of my sliders on the way out to me; I reminded the waiter about the cheese so he took them back, replaced the dropped slider and put slices of cold cheese on them. The onion overpowered the burgers and the two that weren't dropped were cold by the time they made it into my mouth. I was going to send them back again, but just decided to cut my losses. I imagined the waiter was going to take some of the check down a few bucks for the trouble, but I guess I didn't complain enough. Oh well. Like I said, the brussels were tasty and honestly, the burger that was warm was pretty good. I just wish I'd gone to the noodles place a couple doors down instead."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard that a sliders bar was opening on Elizabeth.  These joints are everywhere in NYC and something I always look forward to.  Smalls did not disappoint and it is so much more than a sliders joint.  I love what they have done with the old NOFO space red, black, and white it's hip and classy.  There were so many delicious options on the menu I wasn't sure what to choose.  My sis and I decided to split a lobster bisque and the short rib sliders.  It's hard to impress me when it comes to lobster bisque because my mother makes the best I've ever had however smalls was extremely tasty - crab, sherry, cream, and I really enjoyed the flaky crust on top.  It's filling so I would share if you can so you can enjoy some of the other menu items.  The short rib sliders melted in my mouth and fresh cut french fries I just can't say enough I will be dreaming about this food for a long time.  I can't wait to get back for more.   Our server was also very friendly which always deserves a big red star!"}
{"text":"Finally wandered into Smalls after much debate on when we should visit. Having only been alive in Elizabeth since January, these guys sure do have a lot to show for their quaint establishment. In the old NoFo on Liz space, for you locals.   Kind of hidden on Elizabeth Ave. One sunken door and a long hallway into the small dining room. About a dozen tables and decent amount of bar seating. I'd recommend sitting at the bar. A little easier from a service perspective and fun to chat with the bartenders.   We were intrigued by many things on the menu. Here starts the laundry list:  Apps:   Mulled Pear Salad. As I've written numerous times before, I'm not a salad eater nor am I a fan of crudit√® in general. This salad made me think twice about how to dress up arugula. Light, sweet, tangy, hint of spiciness and packed full of flavor. Served with a cold, braised pear on the side. Each bite was divine. Definitely worth it. Even for us carnivores.   Zack's Confit Wings. Confit wings? Are you kidding me? This is a huge culinary plus for anyone who understands the process. Makes for such tender and savory poultry. Man. The chili-laden sauce they were tossed in was great. Sweet and spicy, tender. Served with fries, which I was surprised by, but pleasantly. Definitely worth another meal venture.   Entrees:  Eggplant Stack. Talk about a gratuitous, panko-crusted stack of awesome eggplant. Seasoned well and topped with amazing buffalo mozz and roma tomatoes. Balsamic per usual. The mozz sang a different tune from most dishes. Peppered and rather heavily, but tastefully. for you veggies out there, hit it up. You won't be sorry.   Crispy Chicken. Little did you know this was going to be a baller-status plate of fried chicken and waffles. Dude. Never had a more perfectly executed savory waffle. Whatever brine, seasoning and flour mix they're using for their chicken, I want to steal the recipe. I was blown away. Each bite made me want to explore every individual flavor. Wish I had seconds for breakfast the next morning.   Service was incredible. Struck up a great conversation with the bartender. Great to get to know them and hear a little bit of their story.   I'm impressed by Smalls. Apparently they have a huge garden on the roof. I really wanted to see it! They're using local products and using them well.   I'd recommend for lunch. Still big plates with a smaller price. Huge bar as well. Full wine, beer (local brews) and liquor.  Smalls is worth your visit. Glad for them to be in the Elizabeth area.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh Smalls, you are a gem. With your all NC beer list and your delicious food all served in a chic little dinning room that frequently hosts live music (sans cover). I can't help but love you.  Smalls boasts a wide variety of sliders, which come three to an order. They range from blue cheese and double smoked bacon (which were great) to crab cakes (which were also great) . If i could only give you one piece of Smalls advice though it would be to try the garlic chili mashed potatoes. I literally scraped every existent morsel of flavor out of the classy tureen they were served in. If they had served it in a vessel i could have gotten my mug in, I probably would have licked it clean. Well played, Smalls.  The one thing that is keeping me from 5-starsing them all over this here yelp is that at least two items we attempted to order they were out of. If you are going to have something as tasty sounding as drunken short rib sliders on your menu (seriously, how great does that sound?!) it's a bummer if you are out well before closing.  Either way, I will certainly be returning to Smalls for many a brew and tiny burger. It's just to good to miss."}
{"text":"So I came back and adored the 18- Hour Beef Short Rib, Parmesan & Bourbon Creamed Corn, Whipped Garlic & Chili Infused Yukon Gold Potatoes. I could have ate an entire plate of that creamed corn. They also grind all their meat in house which means rare burgers are allowed!"}
{"text":"They might be called Smalls but they're big on flavor. Okay there goes my Obama milk joke for the review, I couldn't help myself. Entering through the longish dark corridor following the bright pink on Tonya's hair I wasn't sure what to really expect. But the decor brightened up with some splashes of red and cool pictures and stuff once it opened up! Kind of like walking into a cave, just call me explorer Jimmy!  We got some Korean bbq wings kicked up a notch, they came with some awesome hand cut fries, and the lunch special which was some fresh made linguini with chicken and a creamy sauce. Yum yum! The food is delicious and reasonably priced, I'll definitely be back to try some more items on the menu here. The chef came out to talk to us a bit once everyone was happy and munching on their lunch to see how we liked it, cool.  I left here happy and full of yummies in my tummy. This review has me wanting to go back already for some chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Walk in and I LOVE the way this place looks!  Holes still in the wall from a knife fight (only don't bring a knife to a knife fight when the other person has a Pick Ax) in a club or concert hall, long before Liz had her stand here, covered only in black paint.  Please NEVER take these \"scars of History away!  Long Hallways (Entrance and to the restrooms) Great looking Bar and Dinning Room...This place is Coooool!  Drunken Short Ribs on a Bavarian (better be if it's a pretzel) Pretzel Buns for tiny sliders.  The taste was Fantastic!   Mayo Warning! ! !  I HATE MAYO! (at the time of this writing the menu contains NO Mayo warning)!  I'll be glad to delete this part of the review if someone can prove the restaurant added it to the list of what comes on the sandwiches (I gave my idea to my server and I'm not making a statement here accept to inform those who despise it more than I.  It was my only recommend change for the Restaurant)!  These sliders even had heaps  of Mayonnaise on them and I was still Totally impressed with the taste (I hardly ever send anything back, nor make many complaints anywhere and did not today even though they quickly offered to remake my order).    The flavor of the Onion Ring Batter (it was cooked when I tasted it, so batter may not be the right terminology) was very good.  The only reason it does not make my Onion Ring list is because it is not one of my favorites, though still one of the better batters in Charlotte and cooked just right!  Drunken Short Ribs 5 yelp stars  Pretzel Bun 5 yelp stars  Onion Rings 3.75 yelp stars  House made Garlic Mayo (I can not rate it since I prefer none).  I bet if you like Mayo You'll really like this one!  How about Dessert:  How about MINT Ice!  That looked like a question the Mint Ice is Fantastic though I think it was meant to be the garnish on this Flourless Chocolate cake!  The Shaved Mint Ice gets 5 yelp stars for flavor, 5 yelp stars for texture (bigger than snow and twice as Romantic, smaller than Hail and ten times softer).  I almost fell in love!  The Flourless Chocolate Cake gets a 2.75 star rating!  The Service gets an EASY five yelp stars and I'm one who invites the minimum amount of service as long as EVERYTHING is PERFECT!  Today I met four of the servers and all four were friendly!  Second meal:  March 7th 2012 Chad style UPDATE : : Service still great!  Storefront Signs are in place and looking great!  The place looks FANTASTIC! The food is ahhh, uh, ok here goes:  Eggplant Stack 3.9 yelp stars  Drunken Short Rib 3.85 yelp stars  Waffles: Fantastic 5 yelp stars  Fried Chicken 3.75 stars  Fries: Better than many, though will not make my \"Lonely Fry\" List 3.25 stars!"}
{"text":"On our second trip to Smalls, we were hoping for a different experience, it didn't happen. Both times we've been, the restaurant has been out of several of the more appealing items. The first time it was super crowded, so seemed possible, the second time not at all, and was just annoying. The food sounds interesting, and does make efforts to be unique, but falls short of the very high prices they charge for such small portions. If I had to describe it, I would call it overcharged glorified pub food. The beer list is interesting, I'll give it that. But just because you dim the lights and turn on dance music doesn't mean you're the hotest stuff around. If I was in the mood for a drink and some ambiance, it would be a good place to start for a drink. If I wanted more expensive food with great flavors I would try out Custom Shop and Carpe Diem nearby. \"You're killin me Smalls!\" - The Sandlot"}
{"text":"Good meal, just short of epic.    I went last week to try it out before a show at the Visulite.  Me and the wife ended up trying 3 small plates rather than a meal to sample as many things as possible.    Korean BBQ Wings - $10 - Cooked perfectly, juicy, tender, sweet, and spicy.  However, they didn't come off as korean at all.  But, Korean BBQ wings sells better than \"sweet and spicy\"  Short Rib sliders - $11-  Flavorful meat, too much horse radish, tasty bun.  Crispy Eggplant Stack - $13 - Lots of flavor  All in all the food was excellent.  The prices were not.  I feel this place would be amazing if everything is 2~4 dollars cheaper per plate.  I will still come back, but not as frequently as I would like."}
{"text":"You must visit this place and try the eggplant stack to start! Chicken and Waffles is awesome. Nice NC Beer selection. All of their burgers are awesome. The staff are very helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Smalls but the food was average and in some cases below average. Our server was nice but did not know anything about the menu. ie: had to ask him what cheeses and meats were on our cheese/meat app and he told us the meat was salmon? I realize they just opened so may give them another shot down the road."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have been to the restaurant. First time eating here though. The first time I came in and sat at the bar while talking with a friend. The girl who served us, blonde hair but forgot her name, was very nice. So nice that I even told her that I loved it in there and would be back. NOW we're leading into today where I finally came in and had a meal in here.   I and the friend that came with me ordered the same thing. The old fashioned burgers. They were fantastic and I would highly recommend them. Yet again we had great service even though this time we had a different person.  The price on the soft drinks is a little higher than normal but no big deal. A 5star place that everyone in Charlotte needs to try at least once."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and me, saw the clip on the news for smalls, and we were eager to try it out. The decor was extremely hip and modern for to days view. My boyfriend ordered the 18 hour beef short rib which was delicious and fell off the bone, it came with the Parmesan cheese and bourbon creamed corn, and the whipped garlic and chili infused Yukon gold potatoes, and both were out of the world fabulous. I had the mulled pear salad, it had arugula, butter creme fraiche which they fill the pear, roasted walnuts and a heavenly citrus vinaigrette. I have to admit I am now addicted  the salad was OMG AMAZING, I did not want it to end. I also had the herbed pommes frites, the best fries I ever tasted. We the split the chocolate orbit cake, very tasty. I was felling a little frisky so I tried the vanilla lady,  which is vanilla vodka and pink lemonade I'll tell u i chugged it lol til the last drop YUMMY. The service was fast and friendly. Always a smile on the servers and bartenders. People from every age and scene was having a blast with there friends.  I was also informed that the prices for lunch was going to be lowered and the hospital staff, cpcc students, and police officers were offered discounts, a great way to show respect for our community.  Would I go back . . . . . . . YESS !  I want  another mulled pear salad now. So want something new and fresh made the chef cooks and prepares everything, try SMALLS . You will not regret it"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day and was surprised it was not very busy.  The space itself is really nice and intimate.    I had the mussels and was so happy with my choice.  The servers were nice, but I think they were failing at their job to greet people that would come in.  I walked in and went straight to the bar, but two sets of people came in after I did and kind of waited around at the \"hostess station\" but no one at the bar said anything and no one came up to greet them.  One set of people actually walked out.  That would be a problem for me if I was the owner.  They have live music on some nights, so I'm looking forward to going back one evening with sweetie."}
{"text":"If the mystery streetcar traveling Elizabeth Avenue were to become reality, I'd be a frequent commuter to Smalls. In the meantime, I'll happily drive there. [By the way, street parking along Elizabeth has been easy and free (after 6 p.m. weekdays) for me the past couple times I've visited.]  My first visit was a small plate-sharing happy hour; my second visit was for dinner. The fried pickles are quite tasty, especially with the peppered buttermilk dressing for dipping. The pimento sliders could've had a touch more of its namesake cheesy goodness in my opinion, but the tender, flavorful beef made it worth the ride. And the eggplant caprese was an interesting, savory twist on the classic.  Make note of the singular form of 18-hour short rib, whether considering your appetite, the pricing ($18) or both. On the side are a bourbon creamed corn I absolutely enjoyed and chli-garlic potatoes, which also were very good and can be ordered as a side if you spring for a different entree.  The wine list is OK, though it has some stiff competition from the N.C. craft beer and creative specialty drink lists.  Service, from host stand to table, was friendly and attentive.  For a cozy, laid-back experience and creative culinary touches, Smalls is worth the trek."}
{"text":"Well. I am not sure what happened. We called to make reservations for 12 people on Saturday night. We showed up and the place was CLOSED?!?!?!? No lights on, no signs... nothing. The neighboring businesses did not seem to know why they were closed. Not cool."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations going into Smalls. I normally am not a chicken and waffles kind of gal (separate yes, together no) but I heard such good things that I couldn't resist. Overall I found the flavor sort of one note- sweet. I liked the thyme in the waffles but I wasn't blown away by the waffle nor the chicken. Next time I'd definitely try something else. Just an FYI the chicken takes 20 minutes to prepare but we were in and out of lunch in about an hour.   We also split the eggplant stack which was perfectly crispy but way over-salted. I also would have liked a bit more of the balsamic glaze. My dining partner thought her shrimp tacos (special) were nothing special but not bad.   Prices were really decent for the huge portions we received...I am shocked that someone thought portions were small or that it was expensive...maybe at dinner?  Service was fine overall, she had us in and out quickly and with a smile."}
{"text":"Small place, big taste. I was fortunate enough to check out Smalls last week for their friends and family opening and enjoyed a small sampling of delicious items while taking in their modern digs! I'm incredibly impressed and delighted that Smalls only serves NC beer and makes everything in house - including all the bread and pastas. How awesome!   Service is incredibly friendly and attentive...just as you want it! Be sure to pay attention to their super creative cocktail menu - this is one of the only places I know of in Charlotte where you can get a gin fizz!   Hubs and I sauntered back in last night for a quiet, Monday night dinner. Here's what I had...   Margherita Flatbread: 4/5: Yum. Toasty, crispity goodness. The tomatoes and shards of cheese were incredibly fresh and a perfect start to the meal. Plus, it's served on a nice piece of slate...love the presentation.   Chicken & Waffles: 4/5: I've never had this Southern staple before (shame on me), so I was more than excited to try Smalls' version with, quiet please, salted. caramel. butter. Yes. That salted caramel butter completely makes this dish. The waffle triangles were perfectly fluffy and crispy and when they were accompanied by the hot, fried chicken, this dish will really made you smile. My only issue with the dish is that both pieces of my chicken were fatty and I had to dig around the bird to get great chunks of meat to accompany my insane waffles.   Get yourself to Smalls and snag a gin fizz and a plate of the fantastic chicken & waffles."}
{"text":"Stopped in for something to go. Ordered the confit wings and pomme frites. The wings were awesome with a great flavor and just the right amount of heat from the Korean BBQ sauce. The pomme frites were good also except the kitchen was a little heavy handed on the salt. I will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Parking was great and I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  Casual but with great accents and artwork.    The fried pickles were offensively good, was that cinnamon? They definitely put a new spin on the term \"anything is good if you fry it\".  Then the sliders came out, top quality ingredients with excellent preparation.  I will absolutely be going back.   Also, in my Maker's and ginger ale? Fresh ginger garnish. Sold."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on V-day and I can honestly say there is nothing small about this place.  Staff is super friendly and the food is FAR better than I expected.  I tried a bit of everything and I can honestly say I did not have one thing I was not a fan of.  I liked two dishes best.  The eggplant... I'm not a fan normally but however it is prepared here I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Wings....WICKED!  I'm not sure what makes these korean but they are spicy and very tasty!  Get a ginger ale and whiskey... they put ginger in the drink!  Not all that busy, on a cool side of town, with some new age decor.  I will definitely be hitting Smalls more frequently."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was a Valentine's Day special or not, but we had the best dessert here. It was a chocolate cake with caramel served with ice cream. Be sure to ask for it just in case.   The staff were very friendly and the service was quick.   They have  a wide arrange of food items and a good selection of beers. All what seem very amazing. I recommend the drunken short rib slider."}
{"text":"Overall reaching for that fourth star, but once they get through their opening week or so they'll definitely be there.   Food was awesome, seriously no question whatsoever - this is tasty goodness, the hand-cut fries are amazing (and I love how so much is made in-house). I reaaally liked the short rib slider on the pretzel roll, and the black&blue was also a big hit. I was a little disappointed at first when only two came out on a plate after seeing three in photos (maybe you get 3 at dinner?), but 2 sliders + some fries = content. Could I have eaten another? Sure. Would I be more inclined to share/swap sliders if I had three? Yes. Granted, we decided we could have probably had about 15 more they were so tasty, but in the end my belly was happy with two.   Service, well, we were the first customers of the day and maybe she just hadn't had time to put her game face on. Definitely pleasant, but some of the questions were a little backwards (\"You guys didn't want any dessert today, right?\"). It also became apparent that they didn't subject all of the staff to a full menu tasting before it opened, but I'll give them til my next visit to figure that one out.   Atmosphere, I love the colors and the set up, they're definitely ready for the after 5 crowd, but they seem to still be working on everything else. It definitely has a lounge feel, but they dimmed the lights, turned up the volume of the music (which  most seemed more appropriate for an evening meal/bar hour), and were adjusting TV channels continually during most of our meal, so I couldn't tell you exactly what they were going for as far as daytime hours, because apparently they're not entirely sure either.   The other two staff members (and I'm guessing one was an owner and maybe a manager, but no one introduced themselves) came by the table to welcome us and give us little tidbits about the place (in the spring veggies will be coming in from the rooftop garden). I definitely will be returning, most likely for dinner as I think this place will really shine in the evening hours, and the bar space (and menu - hello NC beers and delish cocktails!) is very appealing, but the food here is definitely a welcomed addition to Elizabeth. I want to eat everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Smalls thanks to all the positive reviews here on Yelp.  Unfortunately, I came away a bit disappointed.  First off this dinner was with the dinner group.  Two days prior, I had called during their normal business hours to make a reservation.  It was an hour before they closed and I had to leave a message in their voice mail and beep....my message was too long to get all the information in.  I called back the next day  again during their business hours and received the voice mail so I was getting concerned that maybe they had actually closed or something.  Called back a couple hours later and finally got a real live person.  Gave them all the info about the group and they didn't think there would be a problem even though they said they had another group coming in.  But upon arrival, they didn't seem to know anything about our reservation but were determined to accommodate us.   They put us in the middle of the restaurant across from the bar.    The draft beer selections here were all from NC breweries which is one of the things that drew me in here.  And the Greenman IPA that I had 3 of was a real winner so 5 stars for the beer selections!  The menu is simple and the options are inexpensive.  You have your choice of small plates and several varieties of sliders, a few salads, a soup of the day and then there's the large plates.   I opted for the Crispy Chicken which consisted of fried chicken with a chili honey sauce and an herbed batter waffle.  The waffle didn't do anything for me.  I found it rather tasteless.  The chicken and honey sauce was wonderful.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  Unfortunately it also stuck with me for a day.   Service wise, our server was excellent despite the challenges we heard about throughout the night.  The bartender apparently called in and all the servers had to cover.  This included a crash of glasses during the night.  And then later on, the computer died so it took a while for the checks to arrive.  But she still served with a smile even though we think she was about to break down.  What we saw is that the smaller groups seemed to get better service than our table.  There were little things like orders not being correct.  The person who ordered last..like 5 minutes after everyone else, received their food first and I heard things like the crab cake sliders were dry and needed some sort of sauce.  That sauce arrived later in the meal.  It's really a nice place and the staff and patrons were all friendly.  But perhaps we just hit Smalls on a bad night.  I am willing to give them another shot."}
