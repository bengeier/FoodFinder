{"text":"A nice spacious place with friendly service and fresh ingredients that you can taste.   The restaurant is a mix between Japanese and Korean cuisine. We love Korean food, so we ordered the pork bone soup and the jjampong (spicy seafood noodles). These two dishes were solid staples. After seeing another table's sushi rolls. we decided to order the Caterpillar roll (salmon, avocado, crab meat, cucumber) and the Lobster roll (lobster tail, cucumber, avocado). The sushi rolls were delicious and the ingredients were very fresh. The presentation of the sushi made it even more appealing to the eye. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant at least 3 times with a Korean born professional rich business woman and the food, service and prices were always great until today. Came at 12:30 pm and there were about 10 diners and one woman server who was not friendly and bordering on rude. I ordered pork bone soup which did not come boiling hot and didn't taste as good as before. When we say anything to the server, she would hurriedly go away. My friend ordered the tofu dish which came very hot but she was not pleased with the taste too.   We decided not to hold our meetings in this restaurant anymore as well as her other business meetings. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually get the spicy salmon roll and the bulgolgi bibimbap, the quality of the food is pretty good! The staff are all very friendly and welcoming they always give lots of unique and delicious complimentary appetizers as well. We got about 5 different small dishes of appetizers plus a miso soup! Only thing is I wish they still had the bento box lunch specials, they were more reasonably priced. But nonetheless we have become regulars here :)"}
{"text":"This place just opened and we gave it a try for lunch. The menu is standard Korean fare; we ordered the dolsot bimbimbap (meh), chicken bulgogi (meh), jam bbong (pretty good if you like spicy) and jajangmyeon (meh). Note that this place does not do table cooking, if that's what you're looking for. I think this is the only Korean restaurant in the neighbourhood, so it's a decent option if you're in the mood and don't want to drive very far."}
{"text":"The place is quite nice and comfortable. The services are quite nice. Because I was not able to eat raw fish in the maki rolls, I asked to change that not on menu and the servant (look like the owner) were able to make it even after the food is prepared. Pretty nice. However, as a foodie, Taste wise, this is not a place to really enjoy either authentic sushi or Korean food. I ordered pork bone soup and black dragon roll. The soup is tasteless and some of the side dishes tasted weird ( I thought they have gone bad) as compare to all other Korean restaurant side dishes. The black dragon roll is not big but looked ok as there were pretty much rice in the roll which is not the style I liked, and it was made too sweet and not balanced. And the rice was not well prepared either in the pork bone soup or the sushi( this has a good weight when judging on a sushi roll). Overall I give 2 stars because none of the food I ordered have I really enjoyed; to be honest, I'd rather have these from all you can eat and they probably have a better quality then this restaurant. These two dished costed $30 for take out."}
{"text":"Ordered take out to check out the food. Liked how they renovated the place. Servers seem to still be new, because they kept grabbing someone who i think was one of the owners. I ordered their dynamite and california sushi and their kalbi beef. The sushi was covered with fish eggs everywhere. Not a huge fan of that. Sushi tasted just like sushi you get at like loblaws. The kalbi beef was good though! It came with its side dishes and rice. Wish i took pictures but was starving so we inhaled it."}
{"text":"Solid Korean restaurant to add to the Mississauga area!   This replaced a viet/Thai place that I remember being good as well.   Good service - not overly helpful but still good for an Asian place  Good food - authentic flavours and great portions Nice ambience - a lot of seating and clean environment.   Prices are average.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! But wouldn't say it's the best.   Came on a Sunday afternoon, wasn't too busy, got seated right away! I was craving ramen but unfortunately they didn't have any  so I settled for a spicy beef soup that had glass noddles in it (see pictures), it was really good!! Spicy-ness was perfect! Others I came with ordered pork bone soup and bibimbap. If you've been to \"Owl of Minerva\", their pork bone soup is better  All their meals come with the small side dishes. They serve bean sprouts, spicy/chili cucumber, kimchi, mushrooms and pickled radish. I know other restaurants serve potatoes but they didn't have it.   Service was ok. Nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about! They were friendly tho  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch, and although the service is friendly (our waitress was super smiley), it was also unbearably slow. They had a massive group of businessmen eating in a corner near the end of the store, and I couldn't help but notice their prioritization of this group. At one point, the two chefs and the waitress were all over there.   They took very long to bring our food out, and were also very inefficient in doing so. Moreover, they are severely understaffed, and we never even got our tea refilled.  The food was okay, nothing too special. The lunch boxes were quite nice and substantial, whereas the pork bone soups have quite a generous bit of bones (on average, four each). I personally found the sashimi lunch box to offer a better deal than the sushi, since it came accompanied with two nigiri pieces (the sushi only had five). However, there was surprisingly no rice provided with the sashimi.  The tempura was decent, but the shrimp had too much batter. My favourite part was definitely the great assortment of banchan!"}
{"text":"Went for take out and ordered the pork bone soup. Order took 20 mins. Browsed internet with free Wi-Fi while waiting.   The soup was packed in a large white Styrofoam cup in a plastic bag that took forever to get out. Seeing the soup in the plastic bag really felt weird and unsafe ... just imagined plastic leeching into my boiling hot soup.  The soup itself was too sour for my taste but it was meaty. Came with rice and two banchan (side dishes).  Before you say pork bone soup is not something you take out, YES IT IS!! I go to Dai Ichi for pork bone soup and they pack it beautifully in a thick black plastic takeout container with a secure lid.  I won't be having the pork bone soup again as Dai ichi is better! But will go back to dine in and get the bibimbap. Hopefully they can redeem themselves in my eyes."}
{"text":"Food is good but ambience is not good for the price they charge. It's even more expensive than Miga. Miga charges reasonable price for a very nice ambience. This restaurant just empty hall and ok service but expensive."}
{"text":"NEW MENU!  Revised menu now offers a la carte Sushi, Tepanyaki, Udon items, very limited Korean items now. So sad that theres no more Jajamyun wahhhhhh :*("}
{"text":"Bad customer service.. We waited for 40mins for our order and still didnt come. Doesnt matter how nice the place, but if the service is not good.. Forget it! So we left and look for our 2nd restaurant.."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service as noted by other reviews. The server had forgotten a roll I had ordered and I had only ordered two items. Sushi rice was also way warmer than it should be. I left hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Me and family love this place the food is great and it's a very spacious place, the staff is friendly this is our new go to place I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I remember this place to be a crappy pho place I used to come to during my lunch break in high school.  It's now turned into a Korean restaurant.  We ordered one of the hot pots and was not disappointed.  The service was good and it came with Korean appetizers.  I highly recommend this place and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has improved a lot since it opened! You really get a bang for your buck with the combos. I ordered the maki roll lunch special which consisted of 8 spicy salmons and 6 dynamite rolls, along with salad, two gyozas, a whole box of tempera (shrimp, sweet potato, zucchini, broccoli), and a miso soup for only 11.95! It also tasted fresh and good. I love the tempera sauce they gave- it has a ginger taste to it. As well the sauce for the salad is great. Another time I ordered the $25 sushi tray. I believe there was about 40 peices of maki? It consisted of spicy salmon, California, tuna, spicy tuna and dynamite roll. Tasted good and also price is fantastic. Try them out! :)"}
{"text":"Each time we visit this restaurant the quality worsens. My most recent visit we were both very unimpressed. Horrible quality of pieces of pork in pork bone soup, the worst I've ever had. Pork cutlet was very very thin and dried out. Came down with a stomach illness the following day. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went with husband and the toddler and got a nice booth in the back. I love the atmosphere,  the food,  the service. Everything about this place.  Definitely one of the better Korean places I've been to. Very highly recommended. They don't hesitate to give you more side dishes. And their tofu soup is great!"}
{"text":"dinner for 5 on a friday night  Decor: Very clean, spacious, bright and modern Food: I like the combination packages that they have. We ordered the hotpot+entree+ soju and enjoyed sharing the food. They brought out lots of side dishes for us, ones that you don't normally get. Service: It was a bit slow, we waited quite a while for our food and even had to remind them about other dishes that have not arrived yet. But they made it up by giving us free food.   I would come again."}
{"text":"Since their renovations happened a few months ago I find their offerings and dishes fresher and more authentic.   Their side dishes are plentiful,6 dishes and all very good. We had japchae, kimchi, cucumber, bean sprouts, fish cakes, and egg plant.   We ordered their green dragon roll (huge portions and fresh avocado with a large shrimp tempura inside)  Special of the day: Lobster roll, you can see and taste the large piece of lobster in the middle.    Gam Ja Tang (PBS) has great flavor, not spicy enough though but it's not really Korean to have it blazing. Lots of ingredients topped up!  Their bibimbap has large strips of beef in it, I wish it was a raw egg instead of a fried sunny side up egg, but it had a lot of fresh and fermented veggies!  Overall, it's now my 3rd choice of Korean restaurants in sauga, 1st if I don't feel like trekking to dundas.   The service was great and they were very genuine and attentive. My parents loved them!"}
{"text":"This restaurants first and foremost commendment lies with their staff and service. Very warm and kind. I was greeted coming in with a warm welcome and the service was attentive and quick. The food came out in a timely fashion. I ordered the bento box dinner and a sushi roll. Normally korean and japanese fusion restaurants excel in only one of the cuisines. This place however has delectable dishes in both cultures. The sushi is generous in portions and very delicious. The korean dishes are very balanced, not too bland not too salty, and the ingredients are very fresh. Prices are average, would definitely come again and have already recommended it to many friends and family. Will be coming again in the near future!"}
{"text":"K-Ninjas please!  At least update the online menu. Benny K is entertaining guests tonight!  Our order:  Bulgogi, Yue Gae Jang, Spicy Deep Fried Chicken, Dynamite Roll and Steamed Dumplings.    I shall start with the Good. The Yue Gae Jang. I found this soup to be quite tasty and nice and spicy. Lots of meat, noodles and veg.   The Bulgogi and Spicy Chicken were ok in taste but lacked in portion. The steamed dumpling came to us deep fried. Lol. The kids ate them all. They seemed to like them. The Dynamite Roll was put together and presented well. My wife and guests said it was tasty.  Now I have been eating K Food my whole life and can honestly say that I was truly disappointed in New Seoul. First off, when ordering via telephone do not use the online menu as reference. When you are denied almost everything you order is bad start.  Some Yelper has graciously posted pictures of the current menu. Use that to avoid any lets downs."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for good Korean food.    This place used to be a pho restaurant which I never tried because I never heard good things.  When I drove by and saw it was now a Korean restaurant, I knew I had to come try it!  The inside was nice and had really high ceilings.  We ordered the budae jjigae (army stew) to share.  This is by far my favourite Korean dish when I go out.  I don't know why but I love the combination of ramen, hot dogs, pork, tofu, veggies, rice cakes.  All my favourite things all in one!  The price on this was around $25 for two people to share and comes with rice.  Our friend ordered the spicy chicken bulgogi, which was around $20 which seems a bit too pricey in my opinion.  It did come with soup to start though.  The side dishes were good too.  The kimchi was spicy and they had an acorn jello side dish with soya sauce.  This was my first time trying it.  Didn't have much taste but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I must say the food and service here is great. I came here for lunch on the weekend, and given that it had just opened, they took a little while to set up a table for us. Unfortunately they don't offer any lunch specials on the weekend, such as bento boxes, so if we wanted that we would have to pay the dinner price. However, they do have daily specials on the chalkboard by the sushi bar, which had featured rolls and a chirashi lunch special.  We ordered the New Seoul bibimbap, chirashi Lunch, and pork bone soup and we got the typical Korean side dishes as well (soybean sprouts, spicy cucumber salad, braised potatoes, mushrooms, and kimchi). The food came out quickly and it all tasted great. The pork bone soup base was delicious and the pork was very tender. The waiters were very nice and respectful and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I order the original Korean style rolls here. A bit pricey but the best around. You've got to make sure that the right chef is in. I went there 5 times in the span of 2 weeks.?"}
{"text":"I had New Seoul recently again and I would say they are solid. All the times I had this restaurant, pre and post renovations, they were all for take out- all the items were delicious. In terms of (take out) service, the items were prepared in a timely fashion and most importantly it was fresh.  Take out comes with the Korean side dishes- kimchi, oyster mushrooms, salad, bean sprouts and kimchi radish and cucumbers. Miso soup was included as well with the sushi order.  For the food items, I have tried the seafood tofu soup, spicy beef soup, Korean fried chicken, smoked salmon specialty roll, and red dragon roll. Their Korean soup dishes are flavourful and on point! The rolls are big, fresh and super filling. The fried chicken sauce is tasty with a kick..yum!  The restaurant itself was renovated awhile ago and it is nice to see booths and private/sectioned rooms.  I will definitely keep coming back to order as it is fairly close to home. Delivery service would be nice actually. All in all the friendly service and yummy food deserves repeat visits :)"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup has only 3 pieces of bone for 10.95$ .  Soup was warm not hot!  Arrived at 9:35pm, was thrusted the bill at 10pm because that's when they closing.  They still said take your time eating...but they were dimming the lights on us at 10:30 .  Most Toronto places will charge a heaping 5 pieces for $10"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was really good. I ordered the soybean pork stew for lunch. It came with some great banchan and a side order of white rice. The service was great and the food tasted fantastic. Ambiance was casual and quiet and I really liked how clean and authentic the restaurant felt overall. There where many Korean ppl that walked in right after us and they all seemed to be familiar with the courteous staff. I'm definitely coming back to this place next time I'm back in Mississauga. Hands down I think this place beats most other Korean places I've been in the area."}
{"text":"Came here thinking it was my one of My Old Favorite Pho restaurant's. ....little did my friends and I know, the restaurant has been bought out and changed into a Korean place .......ok well we're here now, and like korean food . So....let's give it a try shall we ! Service was a little slow at first , took about 15 minutes to get out orders down . Then mine and a freinds dish came out , however my other friends never did . So we waited and waited the finally brought it 20 minutes later , by that time my buddy has been picking food off our 2 plates and eating some appetizers . So he's pretty full . Anyways other than service lacking ......The food is pretty tasty ..but on the pricey side . I'd consider trying it again ..maybe... But rather go to my other korean joint considering it's closer to my house ...."}
{"text":"Great spicy seafood soup.. service was quick and friendly. I wish they had their cold noodles year round though.. waiting for this still."}
{"text":"If you are thinking of trying out this restaurant...stop thinking and go!  Order the spicy pork bone soup. It comes with steamed rice and it's the best $10 you can spend in the area.  The staff is nice unlike the old vietnamese place that used to be in this restaurant.  They cook everything to order and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with the hubbie. We ordered pork bone soup and soy bean stew. Both were delicious! Im a huge huge fan of gamjatang and I thought this was the best I've had in Mississauga (and I think I've been to every one). The service was quick and courteous. I noticed most of the other people eating were older Korean people hence I doubt they would come on to write a yelp review. I am definitely coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Excellent service! We asked our waiter for more appetizer we got more. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a Korean restaurant at the Chase. For those who live here, we know many restaurants have come and went at this location. It is very convenient if you are in the area as the best client Korean restaurant would be Owl. However the pork bone soup is not on par with the Owl, unless you like it a little more salty and less spicy. I can recommend their seafood spicy noodle soup, it is jammed packed with seafood. However the service is on the slow side, staff is friendly. But beware, food is salty!"}
{"text":"The food here is as very delicious and flavorful. Although the menu is very small, the menu includes the basics of a Korean restaurant but not a big variety. Very similar to 'Owl of Minerva' but with a more formal atmosphere.   The service was good and the food came out very fast. The place was nicely decorated as they had some private booths as well.   I would recommend this to a friend! Although, they are a little bit more pricy then other Korean restaurants, they are worth the try!"}
{"text":"This is our first time at this restaurant since it changed hands (and cuisines).  The decor remains the same, but it appears that the floors have been redone.  We both ordered the pork neck bone soup because (in our opinion) a Korean restaurant is only as good as its pork bone soup.  We definitely were not disappointed. The soup broth was extremely tasty and there was so much meat that we could only finish one portion between two hearty eaters. The menu mentioned potato, but there was none (okay with us).  We would've preferred it to be a little spicier.  The side dishes were soya bean sprouts, seaweed salad, kimchi (could've been spicier) and tofu with what tasted like caramelised onions. All were fresh and tasty.  We look forward to coming back and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"So, this location has sure had their ups and downs! The first new seoul restaurant was 5/5 amazing. Then new ownership came along and honestly it went DOWN HILL so hard (that's when I did my first review) a little while later (like a matter of a couple months) looked like they either got a new chef or again, new owner. Now they're pretty good! They're almost just as good as the first ownership. The only reason I don't give them 5/5 is because they're kimchi isn't as good as the first owners (hahah). If you ever get a chance to stop by, their spicy seafood soup is really good! Service is great and everyone's really nice:)"}
{"text":"Friendly server, the atmosphere is great for casual night out. We have the sushi, sashimi combo and soft tofu stew.  The side dishes are delicious. Food come out pretty quick. The food portion is okay. The food tends to be spicy.  The sushi takes long time to come, all my friend finish before the sushi come. The selection is good. Overall, rolls, sashimi and sushi are all very delicious. The fish is pretty fresh.  I give them 4/5 is because of the waiting time, the overall experience is enjoyable."}
{"text":"This was my first time to New Seoul and I was pleasantly surprised! The flavours of the pork bone soup and seafood tofu were spot on. You can tell that the broth had been simmering for a long time. I had the seafood tofu and the soup was flavourful, fragrant, and wasn't fishy at all. The side dishes consisted of kimchi, pickled cucumber, fried fish cakes cut into strips, sprouts and king oysters (my fav were the fish cakes and cucumbers). The restaurant itself was clean, the seating was comfortable with some sofas and some bigger tables. There are highchairs for the little ones, but there wasn't a change table in the bathroom. There are lunch specials during the week, and I'll be sure to update my review after I try that out :)"}
{"text":"Came here to try out this new Korean restaurant that took over the space of the former Viet Thai restaurant that closed suddenly after quite a long run.  Looks like they did some light renovations like the flooring and the window coverings but keeping the similar feel of the former restaurant.  We went in quite late for lunch (3pm) but thankfully they still had the lunch specials on.  From that menu, we ordered the Dolsot Bibimbab. $11 and the Bulgogi chicken lunch box special $13 (see my pics!)   The food came with the usual Korean bunch of sides like bean sprouts, cabbage kimchi, tofu and pickled radish plus a miso soup.  I must say I was impressed with the food! It was tasty and decently portioned.  I will definitely return here to try some of the other offerings next time!  I'll give it a 4* for now and might bump it up to 5 once I try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Used to be \"fine dining\" and never reached this restaurant because I wasn't ballin' outta control.  My lovely bf took me here on our anniversary and splurged!  My understanding is that they're under a new management and no longer advertise as \"fine dining\".  All dishes were decently priced.  Pork bone soup was pretty decent and nufff pork bone, about 4 big chunks of pork bones!  Very surprised they did not jip us on pork bones.  Volcano roll was delish and spider roll was not that narsty fishy taste that you would get at all-you-can-eat sushi.  Bulgogi and vegetable dish is my go-to; me love dat sizzlin' hot stone bowl!  We came back today and found they are very consistent.  Customer service is on point-- what kind of Asian restaurant comes around a few times to ask how everything is?!  All dolled up on an anniversary night OR a regular night in sweats, they will treat you the same.  Nuff respexx for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in a nicer area of Mississauga, the prices are higher than at other Korean restaurants. I got the jajangmyeon, which was decent and also well priced but it seemed like everything else on the menu was like $3-5 more expensive than usual. Unfortunately the quality isn't there. My family got the spicy hotpot meant for two people. It was filled with veggies and weird choices of meat. There was sausage, chicken I believe, and some spam meat. This was probably the first time that I've seen spam served in a restaurant. The banchan was decent. Service was pretty spotty. They forgot our drink orders, banchan refill, and the bill a few times, and there were also some language barriers. I asked for the wifi password and was handed a business card with no password on it (it was a very nice card though)."}
{"text":"Service: friendly and food came out quickly  Atmosphere: big restaurant but so empty  Food: wouldnt go back as there was nothing that really stood out. Edible but definitely not incredible food. - Japchae - beef and veggies glass noodle - huge portion for price but not tasty at all. This often comes as a side dish at many korean and japanese restaurant and it is way better - Rice was soggy. How can an Asian restaurant mess up rice?! - Kalbi was tasty but holy smokes expensive. 25$ for a tiny dish. We usually go to Miga and they are more expensive but tons of meat for the price.  - Pork bone soup - large rish size for price but the broth is tasteless.  - The little side dishes were limited too.  Wouldnt come back unfortunately."}
