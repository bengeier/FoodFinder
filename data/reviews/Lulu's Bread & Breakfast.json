{"text":"The food taste as good as how they look. Satisfying! I think it's a little expensive for breakfast but the servings are huge, so I think it's just fine. I love their French Toast which are actually like puddings. I like the apple raisin more than the blueberry peach."}
{"text":"Lulu's Bread and Breakfast exceeded all of our expectations. The service was stellar, we felt right at home. The husband enjoyed not one but two of those and one of these for a grand total of three pieces of heaven. If you cannot decide among the many breakfast or brunch options, the friendly counter intelligence are happy to serve up some tasty suggestions."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in town. Actually a great lunch place too. Everything on the menu has been spectacular so far. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"I would come back here every single week if I could. The Benecio del Porko is hands-down the best eggs benedict I've ever had. Pulled pork on grilled cornbread with fresh corn on top? Amazing and filling. My boyfriend's cuban (or their version of a cuban sandwich) was also really good, and very fresh. Their burgers look amazing as well. It's cafeteria style (sort of), where you order at the front, pay, and then find a seat and they bring you your food. Every employee is a sweetheart and are super helpful if you have a dietary restriction.   My only beef with this place is that their coffee is a bit sweet for my tastes. Not anything that should stop someone from checking it out, but just be aware that it'll be pretty sweet if you get a flavored coffee."}
{"text":"The staff is generally friendly, although I never saw Robin smile.   The decor has a \"farm to table\" feel with their patio furniture and mismatching chairs.   You can't really expect much from their food when their \"kitchen\" is behind the counter. I ordered the tartine. The bread was over toasted so it was as hard as a rock. I had to use a steak knife aggressively to cut thru it. My husband got the pastrami hash. It had a pickling flavor due to the large amount of celery that they use.   This place is great for coffee and pastries. Unless you really like coffee, their coffee taste like donut shop coffee. It's a cute place to sit, work on something, read a book or meet up with a friend, but not good for a hot breakfast."}
{"text":"My sister actually found this place I think using Yelp! Thanks Yelp for helping us find this hidden treasure. This great little breakfast place is a little far for me to get to so sadly I actually haven't been back since my first time.   Its a little hard to find because it is hiding behind a metro pizza joint. So you actually can't see it from the street! So as soon as you see the pizza place turn in! Go to the right and you'll see it from the side.   It is a small cozy little spot and actually is connected to the pizza place. We went for breakfast so we got there around 10:30-11am. I guess we missed the rush because there weren't too many people there which was good so we could take our time to look at the menu and check out the store.   There is fresh bread displayed and pastries when you go up to order and a small cooler that displays some of the menu options.   I decided to go with their stuffed french toast. Strawberry and another fruit that I can't remember and it was AMAZING! I never ever have good luck with french toast every single time that I have ordered it I have always been disappointed. This time was a totally different story. It was so delicious and not overly sweet and just the right serving size!   They have an S shaped table that has outlets built into it so you can get some work done or just charge your phone! Very clever.   The service was excellent and the workers are so nice and I just love the homey feel this place exerts.   They also have cronuts on their menu but it is only offered on  a specific day I believe. You can also pre-order them!   Thanks for making my breakfast experience a delicious one!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is the second time I have been in here and I have to say what a pleasant surprise! The setup and ordering is still not my favorite but it was not a cluster of a mess.   This time I ordered the Captain America. A sandwich with white cheddar, ham and sausage. Sounds delicious right? Ah not so much! The bread was AMAZING, but that's where the good ended! The sausage not only tasted like something you would get from the discount grocery store's frozen section it also looked like it was boils instead of grilled! The flavor and texture totally threw me off!  So why 5 stars? The staff was amazingly friendly and though we pretty much serve ourselves they were still very attentive and for my favorite part, the pastries!!  I ordered the \"one of those\" and oh wow! A cross between a donut and a croissant. It was deep fried rolled in sugar and then layered with a thick pastry cream! That alone was worth the second chance I have this place.  It's close and convenient and I'd be willing to order from the menu again. They seem to be on the right track, I just haven't had a breakfast item that has made me fall in love!!"}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast place, really enjoyed the yogurt parfait!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the sweet potato with sausage hash brown meal & my husband was not impressed with the pastrami and hash brown meal. Neither meals are even described as what they truly are. My meal had cubed sweet potatoes that tasted like they were still raw and my husbands meal had no hashbrowns, it had slivers of potato with celery and overly peppery pieces of pastrami. Over priced meals that need better descriptions."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food was amazing!  My son really liked the \"fluffy\" bread on his PB & J!  Will definitely go back.  The staff was very friendly and helpful too."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've tried a few of their pastries and they've all met or exceeded expectations! The vegetable hash has me coming back for brunch always, and although I haven't tried their sandwiches they make me drool when I see another customer eating one   I have had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food, which is why this review isn't 5 stars. They have a lot of people working - seems like it shouldn't take too long for my eggs and hash."}
{"text":"Lulu's is the best little breakfast stop!  We just had their incredible stuffed french toast (today's stuffing was peach and blueberry). It was amazing! Their freshly baked breads are to die for.  The homemade turnovers are so flaky and wonderful.  Lulu is adorable and so friendly and sociable. The owners of Lulu's also own Metro Pizza and are located right next door.  If you haven't tried Metro Pizza then you are truly missing out as well!!! It's so wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out Lulu's for breakfast after a morning trip to Gilcrease Orchards and having worked up an appetite for a good hearty breakfast. The foyer, once you find it, is welcoming and Lulu's offers a great variety of homemade breads and pastries if that's you're thing. The ordering process was easy but I must admit, and the main reason I only give Lulu's two stars, is sticker shock. 2 small water bottles and 2 breakfast sandwiches, $18?!   Ok so I pay the nice lady and we're thinking this is going to be epic. After a short wait, they arrived with our sandwiches, the Skinny Lulu and the Farmhouse. Now I won't take away for flavor, they were delicious. But after all was said and done, I'm still hungry. Each sandwich was comprised of 1 egg and little accoutrement. My skinny lulu was served on the same bun as the farmhouse which is far from skinny and while it was tasty, again, it was one egg with 2 pieces of asparagus. Bummer man.   So don't get me wrong, Lulu's is tasty if you have the budget for it, but keep in mind the portions are TINY. Next time I'll wait til I get home to just make my own farmhouse with my fresh haul from Gilcrease."}
{"text":"Absolutely wretched.  We decided to go here for the first time this morning, as it is close to home and looked nice.  Our order was taken by a woman who I could best describe as abrasive.   We sat and waited for our order for over 30 minutes, at which point I went to the counter and asked how much longer it would be.  The same woman told us that they hadn't started it yet, and 20 minutes was the norm on weekends.  She seemed irritated that I even had the audacity to inquire about our food, and ignored the fact that we had been waiting for over 30 minutes.  Sorry, but I own a restaurant and this is not acceptable.  I was so disappointed that I left, despite already having paid for my meal.  I didn't bother asking for a refund because that is how abrasive this woman was.  DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Wish I had found this gem sooner! Great decor and atmosphere and food is awesome. Had the cinnamon roll (puts Cinnabon to shame) and the pastrami hash breakfast was delicious. Will be a regular."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting something else due to the great reviews, but I was disappointed in Lulu's. The place itself is really cute and has potential, but the menu is very limited and the food we did get was just OK. Service was OK too, but being a small local spot I expected friendlier service. The lady ringing is up was also rude for no reason. The only thing I liked was that their regular brewed coffee was better than most. Bottom line, there are way better options in the area to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Second visit was as good as the first, and I felt they deserved my very first Yelp review.  We've tried the pastrami and grilled vegetable hashes, breakfast burrito, and a couple of egg sandwiches. All were tasty, balanced, and filling. Lulu's obviously uses really good ingredients and puts a lot of thought and love into preparation.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and just downright likable.  I imagine I'll come back here again and again."}
{"text":"I love  hearty breakfasts so i got the Benecio Del Porko - grilled cornbread with pulled pork and 2 over medium eggs on top, with hollandaise and bbq sauce - a southwestern style eggs benedict. Its a large serving, 2 people could share.   My husband decided on the blueberry peach stuffed french toast  its more like a thick bread pudding - decadent and fresh.   The OJ is freahly squeezed and they have many latte flavors to choose from.   Open 7am-3pm, best brunch we've had in awhile!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Lulu's for breakfast yet, you are seriously missing out! Everything that comes out of the kitchen is made with love and is purely delicious! The pastries are light and fluffy. I had the harvest turn over recently and it was amazing. I had the blueberry and peach stuffed French toast this morning. WOW!!! Lulu is a hoot! She's so friendly and fun! Erica and the rest of her staff are very helpful and accommodating. Want to split one if the huge orders...no problem, they will plate it beautifully and serve it with a smile! Love it here!"}
{"text":"First of all most of the food is quite good.  My frustration is that nearly everything is premade and assembled and then just heated up to order. This prevents any customization i.e. for an allergy etc... Additionally while most of the salads are quite appealing those that are topped with fruit etc are also pre-assembled.  So because of that the apples have started to brown, croutons have softened etc. The menu has a lot to offer and many delicious options but I think all of the issues would be ameliorated by making the food to order. Some of the breakfast items with fruit product (i.e. peach french toast etc) taste like canned pie filling as opposed to home made. The more savory items, however, are delicious.  The owner is generally very present and vocal, but she can be just a little intimidating.  They also offer specialty coffee drinks and breads to take home."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. The older lady at the register is rude. The food is bad. A first and last time here."}
{"text":"They need to put a friendlier face at the cashier. The manager has always been a little short, but today's experience ensured that we would not be going back. A couple of parties ahead of us asked if they could have a coffee drink decaf, and she looked at them as if they were stupid and said that they could have any coffee decaf. I half expected her to say \"duh!\". And when they paid, the lady that handed her the card asked if she wanted to  see her ID. She looked at her and asked her why, was she a scammer? Seriously?! I almost didn't want to pay with my credit card after that. In this day and age, you don't take identity theft lightly.  We kept our interaction with her short and sweet, paid, ate our sandwiches and left knowing that we probably won't be coming back. We've been coming here because it's close by and convenient when we want breakfast, but that's the only thing that's been making us come back. The food is good not great, and what we witnessed today made us decide that we'd rather patronize other local places instead of Lulu's... Somewhere where we won't be thinking if we're the next ones the manager will Be rude to, or if we will be the victim of identity theft because she won't bother to check IDs with credit cards even if the cardholder asks."}
{"text":"My wife is a chef and I too have a pretty good idea of what's good and what's crap when it comes to food and we both hated the food so much here that we vowed never to return even though it's conveniently located near our house.  We were so excited when we first arrived and saw the expensive decor and beautiful LOOKING breads and pastries behind the counter.  But when the food came, we realized that these owners had made the same mistake many new restauranteurs make.  They spent a fortune on decor and concept and relied on someone who simply can't cook to put out the food.  AWEFUL, AWEFUL, AWEFUL.  Never again.  We weren't in the mood for stress or we would have asked for our $30 back."}
{"text":"I haven't found a good hippie bakery in las vegas. It's hard to explain that comment. Just know i've rolled thru a lot of hippie utopias in my day, and they have good healthy bakeries. We'll this place is about as good as i've encountered in that genre (for las vegas). I think i had some odd eggplant quiche pastry. Deeelish! Definitely go in and order something weird or decadent at least once."}
{"text":"Yes! Go here! Did not expect to find something so amazing on the outskirts of Vegas. This place was quaint yet modern. The food had a twist or was kicked up a notch. Had the grilled cheese with apple chutney spread and fresh apple slices. So tasty with a little side salad. Also tried the Benicio. Sooooo good! Eggs Benedict with a new bend. After we ordered this dish, they let us know it is award winning. Would have to agree.   If you make it to this place you'll be so happy for the rest of the day. Great service too. Robin is a hoot!"}
{"text":"It's all true.  Even my friend who hates eating anywhere that hasn't been around for 50 years or doesn't have a 1/2 off coupon loved it.  And that was after he got lost a couple of times driving over because he wouldn't pay attention to his GPS.   The food was great.  We split a Bat Ship Crazy sandwich and a Benecio del Porko.   Too bad we don't live in Vegas.  Means we can only eat here a few times a year instead of every week (or day).   What pushes Lulu's into 5 star territory for me is the people who work there.  Robin greeted us and patiently explained everything on the menu.  The kitchen split our orders on separate plates so we didn't have to do it ourselves.  Then both Robin and Erica were constantly checking on us and making sure we had everything we need.   Both women were charming and genuinely friendly.  Love Lulu's."}
{"text":"Disappointed - I was super excited about trying this place based on reviews and pics. I arrived at 11am for brunch/lunch. Both items I ordered were already sold out (breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll) so I settled so for the Sloppy Jose. After ordering, my friend and I spoke for nearly 40 min before our food was delivered. The Sloppy Jose is actually quite dry, not \"sloppy\" at all - tabasco required. While the food was decent, it was certainly not worth a 40 min wait. Upon inquiry, the Manager told us 35-40min was a typical wait time on the weekend so my advice is IF YOU ARE HUNGRY, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. The manager was completely unapologetic and acted as if we were doing her a favor by simply being there. Will not be returning - with HoneyCakes, Babystacks, the Cracked Egg & even Mimi's Cafe all within a 2min radius, there are plenty of options with good food and undoubtedly better service."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a \"one of those\" unfortunately they only serve them on the weekend  but me and my mom had a sandwich, pastry and coffee..... Excellent! The Herman was AWESOME, that pretzel bun is heavenly. The coffee was perfect with my warmed cinnamon roll. I will be back on Saturday!"}
{"text":"Not at all what we expected, which was a sit down place with servers. It's more like Starbucks style of service. Lady behind the cash register (Lulu??) was very rude and inappropriate. And rather condescending to the rest of the staff.  You don't know that you have to order at the counter until they yell across the restaurant at you. Then they hand you a piece of paper with a weird little menu on it and show you props of some of the food. This place is attached to a pizza restaurant, whose connecting doors were open, so while eating breakfast you have to smell pizza. And over flow had to eat in a section in there. Food wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about with very minimal selections. Mostly pasties with a few different looking egg dishes which have way too much bread. And food took a long time to come out. Coffee is self served and you have to get up and go to the counter to get a refill. Weird little place and we will not be back.  A little too strange and the food wasn't good enough to put up with that."}
{"text":"I expected a sit down small quaint restaurant , however when you walk into lulus you actually have to stand in line then order your food. I ordered a Farm house and I was disappointed with it. It is a ton of bread and it had very little egg or bacon. I will give this place another try . I think maybe I just ordered the wrong item. The service was very good and prices were great as well !"}
{"text":"This place is located inside/right next to a Metro Pizza. Overall friendly staff. Cool atmosphere. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The place is so cute and the staff is so cute. You definitely have to stop in and try everything."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ever tried when my wife and I moved to Vegas, and after a year it still stands as one of the best restaurants we've had. It's a really fun, unique little place that only keeps a handful of extremely tasty and sometimes unusual items on their menu. I'm usually not a fan of eggs benedict, but when you substitute the english muffin with cornbread and top it with pulled pork and bbq sauce....that changes everything. I've had that, the breakfast burrito, the french toast, and a few of their lunch sandwiches and I've never been disappointed. And their specialty coffees are fantastic. This is one of those places you have to try at least once because you'll never see anything quite like it again."}
{"text":"Very nice place , hard.working staff and friendly  A+"}
{"text":"Such a cute little breakfast spot. I follow on Facebook to see their weekend specials. They always lure me in! If you've never been you have to get \"one of those\" ... Their version of a cronut. It's amazing! Everything I've had their is good from their pastries to breakfast burritos to their specials. I always take family and friends here when they're visiting. Love this place!"}
{"text":"An excellent way to spend Father's Day. They have an amazing Father's Day special. The KING French toast. I've only been here twice and I am very pleased with the staff. They remember faces and you can not ask for anymore. Excellent food and customer service. I like my French Toast with a side of Stella Artois. I only ask you make this a menu option haha. Thank you for an amazing gem in the North."}
{"text":"Love this place, just wish it was closer to where I live!  We ordered breakfast entrees and a few pastries while we were waiting for our food.  I tried a little bit of my mom's meatloaf sandwich-different from any other meatloaf-but in a good way.  We split a guava croissant and chocolate croissant while waiting for our food-both were great.  my husband's breakfast sandwich was good too.  I had the stuffed apple french toast which was really good, but a little too sweet after eating the pastries.  The servings are good and the prices are reasonable.  They do run out of pastries-my mom was going to buy another guava croissant after we finished eating but they were out.  The place is also nicely decorated."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with the coffee or food ... but, there is almost nothing there. If you want breakfast, go somewhere else. If you want coffee and a bread product, this is a good place. I just think they should get rid of the \"Breakfast\" in the name.   The people are nice, the food is nice, the ambiance is nice. Just, ... no variety."}
{"text":"Tried this place last weekend with my son.  I hag the Skinny Asparagus egg white breakfast sandwich and my son the captain America sandwich,  they were both amazing.  The staff there are all soo nice. We also treated ourselves to their french macaroons and they were amazing.  Great place,  check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Small but what a gem!  I love the feel of this place, early morning, big windows high ceiling, sun comes in, it's a really cool place for breakfast.  Their food is great, I've had several different items.  I've been here on Mother's day, Father's day, when my sister was in town, they handle busy times very well.  Great also for taking pics.  Next time I'm in I'll take food pics."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting place. It's right on the corner of Sky Pointe and Cimarron, attached to the pizza shop (almost missed it). Upon walking in we were greeted immediately and urged to come to the counter for assistance. Most of the sandwich dishes are displayed in a bakery-style window at the order counter.  Items ordered: Large Caramel Macchiato Large White Chocolate Mocha Grilled Veggie Hash Venicia  The drinks were served within 3 minutes of finding our seats (the restaurant is self-seating, I personally like this style) and the food was served 10 minutes later (and it tasted great!)  The staff was very friendly and helpful, the whole experience was overall amazing. I'm surprised I've never heard of this place before. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't like this place. They are incapable of making anything that isn't exactly on the menu. It's not a place to sit have a good breakfast it's a grab and go. I wouldn't go here ever again. They can't even make a simple turkey sandwich. Don't go here if you want a simple breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"The management is the worst ever. Robyn Delay (not LuLu) talks down and belittles customers as well as her employees. Food almost always takes 25+ minutes. Servers are generally nice. They just need to survive the wrath of Robyn. Don't come if you want your food quickly and people talking down to you."}
{"text":"The three of us were exited to go here based on the other reviews. First the Ordering Process was awful - the Order was not entered correctly and two people Finished eating before the Third Plate arrived. Sodas are $ 2.00 per 12 OZ Bottle, the tea is one of those fruity teas sold at Big Lots because no one else would have it. While the place has excellent Bread far above average, everything else is average at best. The Pulled Pork is Overcooked - Under sauced and what is it with raw carrot sticks on the sandwich and Cilantro and Couscous on the side. The Corn Chowder that looks and tastes like canned Whole Corn with Half and Half added. Quiches - forget about it. The Pompous menu is in desperate need of a rework, the service needs Capable Trained employees (even a refill on the Tea is a chore), I can't think of any reason this place will make it. The do have a base of Great Breads - so so deserts, muffins and Danishes ( but nothing that makes them stand out). Management seems to lack Vision of what makes a place great."}
{"text":"After having such a horrible experience at Babystacks (see prior review), my friend and I drove over to Lulu's. I don't know if it was the contrast to the poor service we just experienced but it was so nice to have such good service.  Although  you order at the counter, you can sit in the Metro pizza area which is easier with kids. Also, they brought out drinks over to us, which again helps with kids. They didn't bat an eye when my friend sent her egg back because she forgot to ask for it to be over hard instead of over easy as it normally comes. The manager is always nice and has gone out of her way to make us feel welcome before.    I had the Herman breakfast sandwich, a little pricey (about $8 if I remember correctly), but I love that it comes on a pretzel bun and it is surprisingly filling for just being a sandwich. It is just the sandwich with egg, sausage, cheese and a stone ground mustard.   I have had the chocolate croissant before and it was okay - but of course I am a chocolate croissant aficionado (aka snob) and really only like the traditional french chocolate croissant (as served at Patisserie Manon and the Baguette Cafe). The lemon tart is really good and reminds me of a sour cream lemon pie my hubby makes which is phenomenal. They usually have cookie and muffin samples out which is nice."}
{"text":"Lulu and her staff are so friendly, funny, and helpful. The Benecio Del Porko is to die for! And The Lulu's Breakfast Burrito makes my mouth so happy! I seriously would come here everyday if my waistline could handle it."}
{"text":"awesome food with the friendliest staff!! Their breakfast sandwiches are to die for and I totally love their coffee. The Manager always makes an effort to make you feel welcome and at home! She is the sweetest. Definitely  a place to try!!"}
{"text":"Yum! this place is the spot if you're looking for unique and yummy! I enjoy the atmosphere as it is warm and inviting with a farm/barn like feel. The food  hasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is quaint, delicious, and the staff are so friendly! It feels like I genuinely have a place to go that feels like a \"neighbourhood\" eatery. Every time my parents come into town, this is our first stop!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Nice staff! I had a captain America with the orange juice. Both were delicious! My brother in law had a Cuban sandwich, he liked it a lot. My husband had the hot quesadilla and he didn't like it at all, that's why I didn't give a 5 star, but I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"So, this gem. This GEM of a place will make you so happy. Tastes like it came straight from heaven. I've tried a little of everything on the menu and I haven't had one bad experience ever. They cater to the brunch groups, the lunch bunch, and just those that want a latte with some soft natural light filtered through the windows while they browse quietly on their laptops. They never rush you at the counter, will always happily explain the menu to you, and have consistently great attitudes. It really has that small boutique vibe without the price tag. Although the food would be worth every penny."}
{"text":"Had my first lunch here yesterday. I was so excited because they sounded so great. First, I think they have taken the advice of people because their customer service was better than mentioned below. They took their time to ask us for our order for some unknown reason, but after that, they were very nice and considerate. They asked if we wanted to keep our dessert until we were done since we were taking it home. This way they wouldn't be out of refrigeration. Our server brought over our sandwiches and silverware. She was very attentive and brought samples of their breads over. They do have amazing bread but I was disappointed with my lunch overall. We ordered the Turkey & Brie and the Meatloaf sandwiches. I expected more flavor with the Turkey and Brie. I guess because I expected to tasted the fig jam in the description. It was OK. The Meatloaf was monstrous but it was OK. I think it's cumin that overpowers the flavor? But of course, the bread was fantastic. We took home a Cannoli Cupcake and a Johnny Curtis. The Cannoli Cupcake disappointed. It is a cannoli shell dipped in chocolate but the filling was just a frosting like cream. Not cannoli filling (ricotta, whipped cream, etc). The cupcake was more like a basic dense muffin and not special. It is not a cupcake. Someone here said it was angel food but that is not what I had yesterday. Maybe they changed it? The Johnny Curtis looked so amazing! Two fat slices of a lemon blueberry loaf with frosting in the middle. A frosting sandwich! But the frosting wasn't special, just sweet and I wondered if it was a premade frosting? A nice homemade cream cheese frosting would have been great.  I would have enjoyed the slice more without the frosting. So I would come back to purchase their bread but I will probably not have a meal there again. I want to give them a chance with the other pastries but they will have to visually impress me with something first. I was visually impressed with what I had ordered but the outcome was just a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Got on yelp to find a brunch spot that I had never been before and found this place. When you first walk in the ambience is so quaint. Feels like grandmas kitchen. Had a hard time deciding what I wanted from there menu but ended up deciding to go with the breakfast burrito (even though it's 2 in the afternoon!). Got my favorite apple juice and husband got a bottled old sprite from the coke machine which is pretty cool! Food came fairly quickly and they had cut it for us to spilt. It was a green chili pork breakfast burrito which was so different than one I had ever had before! Had black beans, queso, green chili pork... Mm delicious. I liked the plate clean. They have homemade granola and bread you can buy. I'm all about this place. Eat local as often as you can it always pays off!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for lunch mid-week. I'm sad to say, the place was empty and hope that isn't normally the case. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and went through the menu with us, pointing the items out in a display case. We both ended up getting the Skinny Lulu. Overall, it was a little underwhelming. The large, soft roll kind of took over the sandwich; however, the red pepper pesto was really flavorful and packed a punch. I just wish there had been more of it. I also took a sampling of cookies to go - oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, and chocolate. Wow, the oatmeal raisin and the chocolate cookies were good - not too soft but not hard and crunchy,and just the right amount of sweetness in both. Anyway, I will go back for more cookies but will try something else off the menu next time."}
{"text":"We love this cafe! They have an amazing coffee/latte/cappuccino menu and their weekend breakfast specials are so tasty. I have their French bread toast with skillet potatoes, eggs over medium, bacon, cheese, hollandaise sauce, and 2 asparagus. It's so good!   You order at the counter and then they bring your food to you. Their staff is very friendly. They have a outdoor seating area, and the indoor cafe is very nice.   The wait time can vary, the majority of the time we have no wait, however one time on a Sunday they had a stack of orders and the wait was about 45 mins for our food. Some of the guests grew angry, but we were in no rush and had our coffee to pass the time. They have a small kitchen and with quality  food made-to-order it can take some time."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is EXTREMELY slow. Don't come here if you're hungry and don't feel like waiting 40 minutes for a breakfast sandwich. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The dirty chips were very good. So. much. flavor! The special of the day was a great as well, I would recommend it to anyone in the area for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Lulu's is a little sidebar, bistro-like spot adjacent to Metro Pizza.  Cozy and inviting, there are a few two-seat tables, a long winding multi-seat counter, and a pub style table for larger groups.  A couple of tables are available on the patio for those so inclined to eat outside as well.  A lovely, chirpy lady flutters behind the counter, welcoming all who enter with a warm and genuine hello, and addresses everyone as \"baby.\" It's truly charming. After receiving our gratuitous greeting, this dahling hostess graciously went over the menu with us.  A cold display case showcases the selections.  Now, if I had anything negative to say about this place, it's that the plates of food inside this case are not doing Lulu's any favors.  I don't know if they're wax mock-ups or actual plates of food, but they didn't look appetizing at all.  Had those displays been our only basis in deciding to eat there, we may have turned tail and ran.  But the reviews of this jizzy are on point, and the little lady in the big-rim glasses is uber confident in the food she is serving.  As it turns out, she has every right to be.  We placed our order and were handed this funky little glittery soda bottle with a rabbit card sticking out of the top. Cute, eclectic, memorable.  We first sat at one of the tables, but the seats were a little low for our liking, so we opted to sit at the counter.  The tabletop-to-feed your face ratio was much better.  The food arrived quickly, served by another team member who appeared to truly enjoy her job.  I had the breakfast burrito.  We've all had breakfast burritos.  And we've all cut into a breakfast burrito where the outer edge is six layers of folded tortilla.  That wasn't the case here a'tall.  A laser guided, precision incision into the corner of my burrito revealed a pocket full of cheese, beans, pork and other fillings.  Pipin' hot and full of flavor, the burrito was stuffed full of tasty fixings.  The warm salsa verde added just the right amount of kick, and there was no skimping on the meat.  The verde was so good, we asked for an extra side of it!    After we'd gone and engorged ourselves, we sat for a few minutes and enjoyed the ambiance of the place.  Although it's busy and bustling, the crew are never harried.  They're efficient, courteous, and professional.  And the food is generous, delicious, and fulfilling.  But I believe the success of Lulu's is due to the personality behind the counter.  The sweet little lady in the big spectacles is Lulu's secret weapon.  She treats everyone like family; as if we're coming to visit for a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"1st time I've been here but decided to stop after hearing many good things from my neighbors. Owner was very polite and helpful, I had the Veggie Egg Hash and it was amazing! Cute little atmosphere and great little idea (more than a coffee shop but not a full service restaurant). Can't wait to go back for lunch and try the Dirty Chips my neighbors seem to love :)"}
{"text":"We were just passing through and found this great place for a nice breakfast. Great location, great service, great staff...I would recommend checking it out! Also, they were very pet friendly and treated our dog with as much care as any other customer. We really appreciated it!"}
{"text":"The Yoghurt parfait and Captain America sandwiches are my favorite. They also have the Nutella croissant and other baked pastries that taste very fresh and full of yummy flavors. Excellent customer service too."}
{"text":"Wow, wow... if you love bread pudding you will die over the stuffed French toast. Unbelievable. And the granola and berries tasted like a dessert from heaven.  A breakfast spot that i will definitely be back for!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit in a week.  I discovered that they served the infamous kronut here and have been wanting to try it.  I found out the first time that they only serve them on weekends and was warned to come early.  The first time I came, I had my eye on the custard raisin roll.  There was only one left and the lady in front of me ordered it.  Apparently, what you see is all they have.    So I came back again today (Saturday) at 9 am hoping for a wider selection.  I ordered everything I wanted: kronut, custard raisin roll, and a guava croissant.  Note! There were 3 raisin rolls when I placed my order.  Anyway, I ordered a sit-down meal and they brought me my kronuts to the table (I wanted all the pastries to go).  Then they brought out the meal I ordered.  I advised the waitress that I didn't receive my raisin roll or croissant.  She took my receipt and came back letting me know they sold all the raisin rolls.  WTF! Now I'm pissed.  She tells me she'll go see what they can do and assured me she'd make it right.  Another girl came back to me and apologized letting me know they sold them all and offered to replace it with another pastry.  I ORDERED EVERYTHING I WANTED! Anyway... I requested a refund and left.    Make sure they package your pastry when you place your order! I am upset but the staff was pleasant for both visits. They just need to work on their operation side of things."}
{"text":"Man oh man!!! The family and I absolutely LOVE this place. Such a family oriented restaurant. Staff is so friendly. We love coming here."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Unique food... AWESOME PASTRIES; not your same ol' same ol'. I was getting tired of the same old breakfast places.  I love the contemporary food.  Not your same old bacon and eggs. I can't remember the name of what I ordered, even though I ordered it twice!  But it was a wonderful crusty bread topped with eggs, spring greens and a balsamic glaze. Probably a few more ingredients I can't remember.  BUT definitely a little healthier alternative and so delicious!! I love the décor and the coffee.  It's a great place for all ages. I usually only give reviews for places I love.  If I eat somewhere mediocre, I don't even bother unless it is a really really bad experience."}
{"text":"Very good food. Kids items are limited beyond pastries. Could have used plain french toast, fruit, stuff like that. Super friendly staff. I will come back."}
{"text":"By far Lulu is my fave place to have a blueberry muffin. And the lady behind the counter is very friendly. I will be back soon...."}
{"text":"First time here...will not be the last!! The reason we choose to try this place was yelp. We wanted something different then the same old bacon, eggs & toast ... Here we got that... Started with the cronut....fabulous ....should be called a croheaven because that's what it was... Then I had the benecio del pork or something like that..... Cornbread topped with pulled pork, egg, hollandaise sauce , and corn garnish the top....,it was amazing. We will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"A great local cafe with a \"family\" feel with regard to their customer service. The food is always great and it is extremely clean in appearance!"}
{"text":"We had been here twice  and  the times that we h add come we had gotten an excellent service and great comfort food.    They have  like  a variety  of breakfast goodies and the ones that we had tried are so good and fresh.    The only thing that I dislike is their menu display  The food on display looks old and ewwww! Maybe of they just put a picture on the menu would be nice.    I get it , they want to show the real deal but when we looked at it it just made me think twice if I wanted to get any of the items on display.     I stock to the breakfast that I had the first time and it was delicious , along with my caramel machiatto.   My in law tried the pesto croissant  and was just as good .  The staff is always making sure you have what you need and the place is really neat."}
{"text":"I have driven by this area many times on my way back from Target - but I never even knew this place was there!  It's worth stopping by - it's a really cute little spot for breakfast or lunch.  Breakfast items are served until they close (at 3pm).  The staff was really friendly.  The atmosphere is charming, with exposed brick walls, a sliding barn door and quirky décor.  It is actually connected to Metro Pizza next door.  My brother tried the Benicio Del Porko - just for the name alone!  He said it was very good.  I had a turkey sandwich, and was really pleased to see it was made with real turkey that looked like it was sliced right off the bird, instead of just lunchmeat.  And I think they bake their own bread.  Next time you're at Target, instead of going to nearby Taco Bell, or worse - eating in the Target \"café\" I recommend that you stop by Lulu's.  Small neighborhood spots need our support!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Their breads are to die for, as are the pistachio cookies. The shroom frittata was not as yummy as I'd hoped. I will go back for the bread and service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Benicio Del Porko is one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Great staff."}
{"text":"Went here today! What a nice little spot! Tasty breakfast sandwiches, and the bread and pastry are amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved the Dirty Chips. Would go just for those!! Wasn't horribly impressed with the sandwich I got, but willing to give it another try. Employees were attentive and patient with us for our first time. Macaroons were delicious!"}
{"text":"They quickly take your order but then take FOREVER to get your food to you.  30 mins to wait for eggs at a place that's not really a restaurant is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just perfect for a Sunday morning family breaky.  Good food. Happy staff.  Will most def return."}
{"text":"This is a great little counter service place. They have breakfast, lunch, an assortment of baked goods, and a pretty extensive menu of their specialty lattes. We were there early on a week day morning, and judging by some of the other reviews, this is the time to come. It was pretty empty in there, and I'm assuming it can get really packed on the weekends, so if you live in the area this would make a great before work stop, as service was fast. This place is small, and could get busy pretty quickly.  The decor inside is wonderful, and there are tons of windows!  We had the vegetable hash which was delicious and loaded with plenty of flavorful veggies, the eggs were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the toast which was their bread of the day (a yummy french country loaf) was perfectly toasted and delicious. We also had a breakfast sandwich though I cant remember the name, the bun was large and fresh, it came spread with a yummy onion jam, spinach, tomatoes, thick cut bacon and another perfectly cooked egg. Their house yogurt parfait was great, and their homemade granola was so good we bought a bag to take home, its loaded with lightly sweetened roasted nuts and tons of dried fruits.  Overall the food and experience was great and we will definitely be back if we are in the area. It is located very close to the gikcrease nature sanctuary and Floyd lamb state park, so if you are planning a trip out their with kids this is a nice place to fuel up before you go."}
{"text":"Felt like something was missing from the whole experience. My husband and I were the only customers at the time. The food was okay and pricey. Chairs aren't exactly the most comfortable and obviously only for aesthetic purposes. I found it hard choosing an item as nothing really appealed to me. The service wasn't terrible, but not excellent either. It's not even close to being a great brunch joint. There is nothing about it that makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"Unique, charming, and oh-so delicious! We absolutely love this place! The Benecio Del Porko is a great brunch dish and enough for two to share!"}
{"text":"No gluten free bread at this bakery,  and most of the foods have been pre-made and are just heated before serving."}
{"text":"This place is, by far, one our city's best hidden treasures. The food is always, always, ALWAYS good! Warning: it's a little slow to come out. But so totally worth the wait! Add to that, the yummy baked goods you can take to go-- loaves of fresh bread, muffins and so much more!  Let's not forget the hollandaise sauce - I could drink it!  Finally, I can't say enough about the staff! The gals behind the counter never show signs of fatigue or stress, no matter how busy they are. The waitress staff bats a hump like few I've seen and it's all topped off with Robin - the manager. She Treats you like family and you never leave with a empty heart or belly. Long live Lulu's!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome breakfast this morning at Lulu's  I was with Sandra, Morgan, Loreen and her son Nick  I had an SOB and it was AWESOME!!!  We will be goning back regularly   Great job by the staff, all we friendly and helpfull two thumbs WAY up  keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business with such a rude, grouchy, unprofessional owner/manager? She threw my plastic fork and spoon at me while I was paying at the register and they ended up on the floor. When I asked for another set, she tossed those as well but I caught them before they made the floor. THEN she threw the CC I paid with! WTH?   Food was ok although limited in selection. For a small business one would think the owner would make an effort to put her best foot forward and set the tone for her staff. From other reviews I've read, this has been going on for awhile. So I end this review the way I started it, how does this place stay in business?"}
{"text":"I've been enjoying this Metro Pizza location for about a decade (since they opened), but have never had a positive experience with (the attached) Lulu's. The vibe is cold and unfriendly.  Today, I visited and was greeted by an extremely kind and helpful young woman. She told me about their breads (they only had three options--pretzel rolls, brioche, and country white), cookies (two options), and pastries (4-5 options) and asked if I wanted one of their made-to-order sandwiches. I just purchased two bakery items--a cinnamon roll and cream-filled croissant. Both were huge and incredible! The croissant was overflowing with yummy cream. The cinnamon roll, covered in cream cheese frosting, was more of an elephant ear (I think that's what they're called... you know, they're like coiled pie crust sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar). The croissant was underpriced at $3.50, but the cinnamon roll was overpriced at $5.   I loved the pastries, but can't see myself going back too soon. The woman who took my payment at the counter was downright rude. She said she's been the manager for over 20 years which, apparently, explains my past experiences. I was kind and smiled, and yet she yanked my payment card rom my hand and seemingly threw it back. She scowled the entire time and gave me the impression that I was disturbing her simply by purchasing items from her store."}
{"text":"I read the positive article in LV Weekly, and was excited to try this place since it is so close to home. I was impressed by the atmosphere when I walked in, but my positive mood soon took a turn for the worse. The teenage kids behind the counter were nice enough, but when my GF ordered a featured chicken chorizo sandwich after five minutes of debating, only then were we told that they were out of chicken chorizo, lol. After ordering, we stood in front of the register at the opposite end of the counter only to be ignored by a woman (who I can only assume was Lulu herself), while she filed receipts, moved things around and belittled the staff. When I finally got attention from one of the teens behind the counter to ask the price of a specific bottled soda, no one knew. The teen cashier asked the stern Lulu lady, who ignored us (even though we were still right in front of her) and snapped a vague answer back to the cashier. The poor girl cashier looked so scared to get a clear answer from this Lulu lady, that she told me the price was \"between $1.50 and $3.00\". I put the soda back. When Lulu finally acknowledged us, my GF presented a coupon. Apparently Lulu wasn't ready for it and snapped, \"yeah, I see it\". So not only does she treat her staff like isht, she follows suit with customers. Now to the food. We were the only order working, and it took 15 minutes to make two sandwiches. It may have had something to do with Lulu charging up to the teen male cook and belittling him out in the open about not following her instructions. My roast beef sandwich was poor quality and impossible to chew. Very fatty. The bread was good, but the side was barely something you could consider a salad. Out of about six employees trying to act busy, not one asked us how our food was. I'm guessing by the guilty looks silently screaming \"help me\" I kept getting from the staff, none wanted to be fired by the evil old lady who runs the place. My guess is the Metro Pizza owners gave grandma a project to keep her busy, and out of their hair. Good for them, bad for us."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while not only because the place has a cute, relaxing vibe but also because they have great breakfast selections. Their freshly made pastries and coffee are also amazing. My favorite is their Macchiato and Raisin Croissant. I love the outdoor seating area, especially during the Spring and Fall when you can enjoy a nice breeze and warm sun while having your breakfast. The waitresses are nice and friendly. The lady at the register, believed to be the owner, is also nice but sometimes she can get in your face a little with her sassy attitude. They also have a few rare but delicious selections for bottled juice and soda from the East Coast that other restaurants don't have. If you haven't been here, definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Captain America breakfast sandwich great choice! Don't miss out in the famous Cronut. Staff very friendly and efficient. Lady behind counter calls everyone baby and is super friendly and very customer service conscious!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls are amazing mainly because of the \"frosting\" on top. The frosting must be made with cream cheese and the rolls are more or a patty like texture. The breakfast sandwiches are good as well."}
{"text":"Small out of the way place attached to the Metro pizza location off of 95.  Pretty decent food for the price."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast me and my family have had in years! Thank you Lulu's staff! You just gained weekly regulars!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast. The atmosphere was clean. The young lady taking our order was pleasant. One of our group ordered the pastrami hash and eggs. The hash was potatoes, celery, carrots and a sprig of pastrami. Eggs were not cooked to the order. The other person ordered the fritatta, more like a omelette very bland. Toast was good. Service was on spot. Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to finally tasting a cronut, but after I arrived at Lulu's, I found out they're only available on the weekends.  Keep that in mind if you're looking for that.  I had a cinnamon roll... The flavors were sweet and tasted nice. Lots of frosting on top of the flaky bun,  I love sweets and could have been fine with less frosting, but I would order a cinnamon roll again.    I also sampled a chocolate muffin and blueberry muffin, both were really good.   I had a couple bites of my friends \"Herman\" breakfast sandwhich, and it was pretty good. You can taste the quality of the ingredients in the food.   Here's and extra bonus: GREAT prices! For the quality, you really can't beat a breakfast like this in this area. I'll definitely be back again, because I have to try that cronut!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim 'cause the sister and I wanted to share a meal before I had to head to work. It was the first time too.  Cute restaurant and overall theme. Kinda funny how Christmas decorations are still up XD Staff was nice and informative. They checked on us a couple times, and it sounded like they knew a few of their regular patrons well. I had wanted the SOB, but they had to substitute it for the similarly crafted Sloppy Jose, and I was not disappointed. Shredded/tender chicken with a salsa verde sauce and overeasy egg on a freshly baked bun. Who can be let down by that? Not to mention that my mocha with peanut butter was pretty good - reminded me of a subtle peanut butter cups.  My sister liked their Frittata of the Day. She just wished that she had more of it 'cause it was about the size of a slice of pie. Enjoyed the toasted bread, salad with vinaigrette, and a side of Chai Latte.  Next time I'll see if I can order an extra sandwich to go for lunch at work."}
{"text":"THe GF and were up in the area running some errands before breakfast and were in the mood to try something recommended off of the yelp app.  We say Lulu's and thought we would give a try. ,  Located on the side of a Metro Pizza, it has a very cafe sort of feel to it.  The menu has a sort of cafe feel to it.  The service was friendly and was hustling.  LB&B is not an IHOP.  It does not resemble any type of breakfast joint one would find on the side of highway.  LB&B is more bakery than greasy spoon.  If you are looking for light breakfast, carbohydrate charged fare, then this is it."}
{"text":"I'm probably one of the picky eaters when it comes to a breakfast sandwich. I'm from NJ, the land of diners, bagel shops, and delis. I've lived here for a year and have been looking for my breakfast sandwich place that's worthy of my belly. And Lulu's earned that spot.  The Captain America is the best breakfast sandwich that I've had here so far. Sausage, egg and cheese with ham on a pretzel bread. Its the perfect balance of spices, salt, and bread. Had it with a chocolate muffin. It was heavenly and had the well done muffin tops. Downed it with a lot of milk. Perfect breakfast, period."}
{"text":"If you are interested in anything other than great food, go elsewhere. Sure, the service is adequate and not more than that.  I get where the 3-star reviews are coming from but I don't require Michelin-level service for breakfast. I crave this place. The combination of perfectly cooked egg and still-crunchy bread--in whatever form you order--is worth the trip.  If you're upset that you must eat that perfect breakfast in a pizza joint, please ignore this review and continue your write-up of Panera."}
{"text":"My hubby and I drove all the way across town to try this place out. I have heard lots about it. I got the eggs and hash and my hubby got eggs benidect. We always split our meals and share them. The hash was soo good it had pastrami in it. The eggs benidect had pulled pork and was on a piece of corn bread. It was a great twist in a common meal but it was really good. I loved the fresh toast. It was definetly worth the drive. We can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went to Lulus today for the first time and I was not disappointed. I had a ham and gruyere tartine and it was absolutely delicious. The french bread was perfectly buttery and toasted without being too crunchy. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked (which can be a challenge). There was plenty of ham and cheese as well and a very nice hollandaise sauce in top. The grilled asparagus was a great compliment as well. The portion size was VERY generous and a great value. The staff werevery nice, speedy and attentive. I like the relaxed atmosphere and eclectic decor.  I will definitely be visiting Lulus again to try some of the scrumptious looking pastries."}
{"text":"Really good food! I've ordeeed the bbq on cornbread before as well as the breakfast burrito. The burrito i would definitely be back for! The owner isn't the most friendly both times I've been there but the environment & food are so fun."}
{"text":"Their egg on a soft roll are fantastic!  It's always a pleasure to have breakfast or lunch at the cafe.  The staff are nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"Drove all the way to centennial for Lulu's but couldn't make it early enough to get cronuts.  Bummer, but still, items we had here were all good in quality.  I'll update my review when I have a chance to try their cronuts."}
{"text":"Never a letdown!!! Their consistency and fantastic tastes always leave me wanting more! I have my favorites but will always try something new!!!!Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love trying out new stuff, but going somewhere new is intimidating and somewhat overwhelming. The staff took the time to go over the whole menu and asked about me and food preferences then determining what was best for me to try. I ordered the S.O.B. and was not disappointed. The bread was just delicious and the chicken sausage was plain amazing. I'm glad I found this place and would recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"The morning that my family and I went they were having a problem with their computer system. I understand the frustrations of this problem, being a restaurant manager myself. This caused the food wait time to be slightly longer, which was expected and accepted. Food was TOP NOTCH!! My breakfast burrito had pork and cheese and spicy green sauce. For not being a Mexican restaurant they could have fooled me.  My husband and son both got breakfast sandwiches. They were both very pleased and their hunger satisfied when we left.  The staff was scrambling to get all the guests the correct menu selections in a timely fashion. They were holding it together pretty well. The older woman and the cash register was very \"snarly\" and continued to complain about her problem and frustration with the computers while we handed her our meal ticket. I smiled and said \"yes, I know its a hassle.\" She proceeded to tell me that I \"couldn't imagine\" and I \"had no idea\". I politely smiled, and went to be seated. She was very unprofessional and on the verge of RUDE. She snapped at two of the young ladies behind the counter about their tickets while we were standing there. I was shocked. She should not be in that position if she cannot handle the stress, The young ladies scrambling around the dining area never lost their smiles. Although I did not receive the coffee that I ordered until we had paid. The coffee was good. (we ate before we paid bc they were waiting for the computer in order to run the CC.)"}
{"text":"Cute brunch spot in the quiet Centennial Hills area, with fresh-made breads and a fun menu of creative breakfast staples. Come here with time to spare, because it's not a quick spot. If you can, snag one of the few seats on the porch.  The #Bernie sandwich (egg, Vermont cheddar, soppressata, pesto, tomato on brioche) was huge and delicious, as was the No-Jito (blueberry mint lemonade), and I was drooling over their Red Velvet Whoopie Pies. Unfortunately they were out of bread by my 1PM arrival, but their homemade granola was on sale!  But like I said, come here with time to spare. Even coming after their morning rush, I waited half an hour for my food. Ordering system is unnecessarily complicated, with no posted menu (just several printed sheets), one slow-moving line to order merging with another to pay, with an aggressively polite cashier barking at employees and peppering each sentence with \"honey\", \"baby\", and \"sweetie\". From my observations in line for 15 minutes, it seems like their menu is too large for their limited kitchen space, causing the long waits for food. If this spot could be reorganized to improve efficiency, I'd be more inclined to return."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for breakfast once we will return for sure.   Atmosphere: I was wowed it really doesn't feel like a Las Vegas shoppe for sure. The owner is helming the register and there are a half dozen workers handling food and orders. The shop was decorated for Valentine's Day and felt very quaint and local. The big table in the middle indicated a nice local feel where you would meet your neighbors for coffee. It has a small bathroom and shared the space with a metro pizza. Overall awesome for a vegas spot.   Food: mixed. The baked goods were amazing. The coffee was nothing special fresh and hot. I ordered the benicio del porko. It was good, new flavor combination for me and a generous portion. My wife had the new years resolution it was flavorful and also a great portion.  Service: although the service was very friendly their system is cluttered and inefficient for a rush. The counter takes your order and you walk it to the register (which was out of service when we walked in) there were about 10 people in line and we were up. We felt rushed and in the way. The order went smoothly and food came out slowly. They even forgot my coffee. Twice. But very friendly wait staff and workers. Kudos.  Tl;Dr food was good takes kinda long. Price was alright. Get baked goods."}
{"text":"The food was good. The Benedict was good except the corn bread was a bit over cooked. I would've given higher stars just it took 45 minutes for me to get breakfast! They also had an employee that brought food out for themselves and ate right in front of us while we waited really long for our food. All and all if they don't fix this problem they will start losing business. Also pretty upset at 11am they had no pastries left either. They had all afternoon to be open yet and had no pastries or pretzel buns left."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! This place is connected to metro pizza and there is a joint door between the two.  We went there today for lunch and it wasn't busy and the service was friendly and fast. We ordered the 305 Cuban sandwich, dirty chips and their version of eggs Benedict. It all was delicious! The Cuban sandwich pickles were perfect and not the cheap kind and the meat was tasty! It comes with a plain little salad and Cuban coffee which was also good and effective in the caffeine dept.  The eggs Benedict was on corn bread with pulled pork, egg, hollandaise sauce, corn and cilantro. Very unique! The dirty chips we had to try since they were recommend to us by coworkers and those were also unique and tasty! Lays potato hips with hollandaise sauce pulled pork cheese and cilantro. Portions are a good size and we walked out of there in a good coma! Glad we found this little place and I will be going back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We drive across town just to have breakfast/brunch - great feel, unique menu, fresh food - overall great service and quality - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ill be short and to the point. Ordering your food is a nightmare. No fountain drinks, food was ok, older lady who was at the register was a bit cold, food took 53 min from the time i paid to the time it reach my table. I doubt that ill be returning."}
{"text":"So yummy! I got the sloppy Jose and my husband got the burrito. Both were delicious and a wee bit spicy. I have it 4 stars because my latte was just okay and it took about 15 mins to get our food. But I guess you can't rush fresh food! It's also tucked away and took some time to find it."}
{"text":"LOVE Lulu's - the frittata was okay, salad great and toast was amazing!! But the best thing was the individual Mimosas. The Manager is running the place efficiently as a good Nawleans does!! Bringing the gulf coast to the desert!   Thank you Lulu!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee is fantastic - and the SOB breakfast sandwich as well as the  Lulu Light are amazing!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. It is truly a different experience. Once you get used to how to order (think old style deli/ bakery) it is deadly frat. The staff is warm and friendly. We loved it."}
{"text":"Breakfast indulgences!  Another fun spot that I found with the help of Yelp. We came here early on a Saturday morning and I already knew what I wanted to try after reading the reviews and checking out all the great pics.   The star of the show was the - Benecio del porko. WOW! I've never had such a flavorful, colorful and decadent benedict ever before. I could only eat one out of the two because this dish was so rich. I highly recommend you try it!  We also ordered a breakfast sandwich that was called - Captain America with ham & eggs and it was good but nothing special. On the sweet side we tried the custard cronut & it was fresh & delicious.   The lady who took our order was really charming & funny which is always appreciated but it took over 20 mins to get our food as there must have been an issue in the kitchen.   The decor is very cool & I appreciated the cute and very clean bathroom. I will most likely be back  as there's a lot more interesting items on the menu to try!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the first time today and we were not disappointed! This place has a great atmosphere, a friendly team, and the owner (we assume) was incredibly personable and manning the register.  Food was incredible! We got the blueberry croissant and cheese danish to start... flaky and delicious pastry on both. I had the frittata and my husband got the Benedicio del Porko. My frittata was good, but I have to rave about the toasted bread that came with it! It didn't seem like it had any topping but still so much flavor. My husband loved his breakfast and said the cornbread and pulled pork were some of the best he's had.   We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I still like this place but I had some issues with my last visit.  They have a grilled cheese of the day and unfortunately it was absolutely horrible.  I really hope it was just a bad day. It was turkey, bacon, Brie and cranberry.  Sounds kinda good?  It did to me.  The turkey was dry and tasted like it was going bad.  The Brie was also funky with a funny flavor to it.  They used tons of dried whole cranberries and they were sooooo sour.  The worst sandwich I've ever tasted.  The salad it came with was overwhelmingly drenched in dressing and not edible.  Just a tip for the cook; cranberry sauce or chutney would have been so much better.  Fresher turkey and cheese would also make a world of difference.  The bread was good and so was the bacon.  I deconstructed my sandwich and just ate those.  I'm not good at sending food back, never have been.  Plus the food took a bit and I didn't have time to wait for something else.  I did enjoy my coffee!  The older lady that cashiers might want to think about treating the employees better.  She seemed so aggressively angry and rude to them in front of customers.  They were all so robotic and seemed scared of her.  It was interesting to see all the fake sweeties and babies she gave to the customers but would turn around and bark orders at the other workers.  Made me uncomfortable and I felt sorry for the employees.  I would probably like this place better if she was more professional."}
{"text":"WOW! I had to call my dad in Oklahoma on FaceTime to tell him where I was at! Every bit of food was gone from my plate in the matter of 10 minutes! Food melted in my mouth! Ordered the  benecio!!!! It's an absolute burst of flavor in your mouth. Great mix of flavors with sweet but savory . Also ordered the stuffed French toast!!! Another MIYM (melt in your mouth)  Noticed everyone also enjoying their coffee drinks. As we did ours!.  Great atmosphere. Counting this as a new favorite.  Will be back!. Probably sooner than later"}
{"text":"Delicious and unique breakfast.  The cappuccinos were amazing too. The speed of service could be better with a more efficient system...just looked somewhat hectic. All in all, it was great food in a pleasant atmosphere. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Looks like a small quaint place from the outside, but very spacious inside since the owner of Metro pizza also owns LuLu's and has it open for seating. Small but unique menu. A gem of a place."}
{"text":"Breakfast with a side of personality. : )  Cute little hidden gem tucked away at the edge of town. Offering up good eats and mouth watering pastries. Spoiler alert: your diet will be ruined today. But it's okay. Treat Yo Self!   Benicio Del Porko and Dirty Chips are highly recommended. Skip the Pastrami Hash. Not a lot of meat, too much celery (Yes, I said celery. Weird right? lol) and soggy potatoes. I did like toast and jam that came with it though. Super crunchy & buttery...mmmm. And we really enjoyed the stuffed (Apple) French Toast. My kids practically demolished it.   Plan ahead and make sure you have some time on your hands, you'll be waiting a good amount for your meal. They share the building with Metro Pizza so you can basically sit wherever you want. Try the patio if the weather permits."}
{"text":"Fast Service, the cashier has a great personality, and the food is great. Our favorite so far is the Benicio Del Porko!"}
{"text":"We went based on the write-up in Las Vegas Weekly as Best New Bakery.  Maybe we anticipated too much.  Confusing area, no greeters, dirty tables, uncomfortable chairs,  food was quite bland and pricey for what we got.  Woman who was cashier was not friendly, and her fake eyelashes were falling off.  We ordered a breakfast \"meal\" - would have been better off to just stick with a pastry and coffee.  Sorry - we won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh em geeeee what a hidden gem! Located behind Metro Pizza is where you can find them. Everything was superb from the pastries to the specialty drinks it was an A+. We tried the The chocolate croissant and another pastry I forgot the name while we sipped on Chai Tea Lattes and a mocha frappucino  while we waited for our Benecio's to be ready. Just delicious! Once the main meal came omg what an explosion of flavors. Highly recommend this place if your looking for something other than your typical eggs and bacon dishes. The price point isnt horrible but when you add pastries and specialty drinks your bill will jump up to about $50 for two ppl. The Benecio platter is pretty large two ppl can definitely share that so portions are huge even with the pastries. Since this was our first time there we didn't know what to expect and wanted to try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"We stopped again at lulus for their great semolina bread which is baked fresh. We Italians love our semolina and John the owner makes a great semolina bread. For sandwiches or toast it is excellent stop by Lulu's or Metro Pizza and try it. And their Pizza is fantastic."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and unfortunately my cousin's don't drink coffee in the morning (gasp!) So I walked 1.5 miles (even though there were two Starbucks closer) to try something different. Didn't know what to get and the employees were super helpful with suggestion... I got the Lulu's signature caramel salted latte iced and it was delicious and worth the walk!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have friendly-service, a delicious breakfast/lunch menu and the homemade pastries are to die for! I love the Chocolate Croissant and i'm obsessed with the Salted Caramel Iced Latte....so much that i have to stop myself from going every morning!   Next to Metro Pizza, the building feels cozy and has a barn like feel to it. You order in the front and they bring out the food to you. They have new specials every weekend, love that they like to keep it fresh but sucks if you go again and want that item again and don't have it. I loved this Watermelon Arugula Salad and Strawberry Shortcakes wish they put them on their menu.   Can't wait to go back and see what new dishes and pastries they have! Just what the North-West needed a great bakery!!! I say the best in the NW : )"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I didnt want some boring IHOP or a buffet. As I was near Quest diagnostics and didnt want to wait an hour and a half on an empty stomach at 1030 AM So I yelped and came through.  Always listen to your GPS. The place is connected to Metro Pizza even if there is no sign.   The lady was really helpful. Menu was simple but everything looked really good. I wanted pancakes but settled for french toast which was amazing. If Im gonna drive in circles I wasnt just going to settle For 1 meal so i ate the recommended plate that looked like eggs benedict on roids. I was completely satisfied   Looks like an awesome place to hang out. Luckily it was dead on a Wed morning.  Cant wait to try the rest of their stuff.   Consider me a huge fan"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and gave it a try today. Overall it was good but not impressive. The lady at the register was super rude to us, and she is the reason I give this place only 3 stars. Although, other staff was friendly. The food was fine, but the menu selection wasn't very exiting to me because I'm not big on pork. Coffee was ok. Prices are reasonable. The restaurant interior is cute but has limited sitting options. Empty tables never got wiped out while we were there."}
{"text":"Came here with my Mommy in law last week, such a cute rustic place..love the feel! Staff was friendly. I ordered the French toast with peaches, a butterscotch iced drink decaf, and a yogurt parfait, everything was yummy! They don't have a huge selection of food but what they do have is/looks good. If you have picky children this might not be the place to eat at with them. You could try every family is different. I'd bring my hubby but don't think my kids would enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere and delicious baked goods/breads. However ordered a frittata and it was like eating a rubber sponge. Not good at all. I'm not a food snob, but it was truly disappointing. Truly."}
{"text":"This place is top 3 places for breakfast hands down. Unfortunately, there's only one I am aware of in the NW side of town. I have almost ordered all their menu and have not had one bad thing. Their Hollandaise sauce is amazing along with their bbq pork. If you have any doubts you should try it. Definitely a must go when in town!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bakery only.  Since Sweet Delights Cuban Bakery closed over two years ago, I've missed great pastry in the north side of Vegas near my mom's house. When my brother, a picky pastry fanatic, raved about this place, it was definitely worth a try since I am in Vegas once a month.  So on a Monday morning a 7:30 AM, I made the five mile trek from my mom's house into this bakery  not too far from a Target.    From the outside, I could see some smiling counter girls with a smile on their morning faces. When I walked inside, the sweet smell of butter smacked me upside the nose.  The place is big and modern, and there's no question the pastries are stars. There are two families munching heartily on their breakfasts.  But my eyes aimed lustily on the big, the golden brown, beautifully presented croissants.  \"Hello sir, are you here for breakfast? \"Actually, I am here for these pastries\".  They're not too cheap, but once I got them home, the four items... blueberry, apple, plain and chocolate croissants were gone in a flash.  The flavors and texture were perfect. I go to pastry shops all over LA and OC where I live, and only a handful can get that texture just right. Flaky on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. With home brewed French Roast coffee. it was a simply perfect breakfast.  They had some very cool breads that I will try next time, along with other pastries.  My doc says to take it easy on the carbs...limit yourself eating them as an occasional treat.  So I will cut down on sweets until I come back again..."}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of a kind and amazing. Coffee is excellent as well. My wife and I ate here before hiking Mt Charleston."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch spot out in the Centennial Hills Area. As most have mentioned, it can be a bit tricky to find..but set your GPS for Metro Pizza and it'll lead you there. I went Friday mid-morning and did not have to wait in line. Front case was stocked with plenty of pastries, breads, and fresh juices. The cashier was polite and did not rush me through my order. I got the dirty chips for early lunch. The indulgent chips were smothered in sauce and pork and easily guaranteed a food coma for me as I went back to class. At the suggestion of the cashier, I picked up an oatmeal raisin cookie. Mind you, I HATE raisins, but this cookie was perfection. If Lulu's was closer to my house, I could easily see myself eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Laissez les bon Temps roulez! It's like I'm deep in the French Quarter and I have stumbled into culinary voodoo magic. The One of Those,  the fresh bread, the no pulp freshly squeezed OJ - the perfume of foodie goodness dancing in my nostrils - come for brunch. If you don't like this place, crawl back to the IHOP you crawled out from under. This music is not for untrained ears...."}
{"text":"***Over a 1hr wait AFTER ordering food with NO communication or apology ************Customer service from ordering is great. Friendly vibe, great food. However when a business, especially in a food and beverage standpoint, lulus management needs to retrain their staff. Absolutely no communication as to har far of a wait you would be waiting for your food. I understand breakfast on Saturday from ordering to sitting should take no more than 20min, but an hour plus wait is simply unacceptable. No one checked up on us, or no guest/customer recovery from the staff, just a simple, sorry for the wait. This wait should have been communicated prior to us ordering and how they were 45 tickets behind which was told to another customer who was also asking how long, as she too had been waiting for over an hour as well. Unless you want the good food stomped by an over hour wait with no type of reimbursement or communication even a \"hey sorry for this I would like to invite you back for the inconvenience\" don't bother with Lulus. Now with the growth of the city, it's more quantity over quality. *no longer will be a future customer of lulus \""}
{"text":"The wait was a bit crazy due to Mothers Day. Yet, they gave out samples as we waited in line to order. The staff was curious and extremely friendly. The environment was inviting and welcoming.  We had chocolate bread was to die for. The signature drink was delicious!! White chocolate salted Carmel heaven!! We ended up ordering all of it!!   The pastries are amazing, macaroons, chocolate croissants, and the breads!! Oh my gosh! I can easily see why this is a must try place when in Vegas    I had the seasonal stuffed French toast. Blueberry and peach that melts in your mouth.  We also had ordered the both of the burritos on ten menu and neither were a disappointment.  Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The dirty chips are simply amazing. I got the turkey and Brie sandwich and it such a yummy blend of sweet, savory with the added textures of apple and the raisin in the bread.  We also tried their cronut and the coffee cream and crunch was delish.   Come with an appetite because the servings are generous."}
{"text":"Las Vegas local on the NW side. My favorite dish is the Benedict: Benecio Del Porko. They have an excellent food and coffee menu. The head lady in charge is a ball of energy who brightens my day; she's the best."}
{"text":"WOW, the Benecio Del Porko is crazy good!  The service good and friendly. Will definitely be back.   Did not expect this as being part of Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is super cute. The staff is very very nice, the food is only so-so. I got the frittata and had definitely been heated up in the microwave. My son got the hash,  who ever heard of hash with a bunch of celery in it and a few pieces of pastrami. I'd come back and try something else but today's breakfast, not so good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, beginning when they first opened. Their bakery items are incredibly tasty. While there is a menu to look at, there are daily specials that are in a case that they'll describe to you. I love this because you can see exactly what food will look like and the portion size. I've lived everything I've ordered, and the people there are friendly. The only reason I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is the price. For a place like that, I don't think their price point is wrong; it's just a bit more than I prefer to pay for breakfast. I will definitely be back and continue recommending this place!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got 4 stars. The service was okay but the food!!! It was just bad. Worse-than-my-leftover-stir-fry bad.   Came up here one morning to go to Gilcrease and just wanted to grab some coffee and quick breakfast.   The coffee: watered down, and tasted like it was from stale coffee beans.   The food: got vegetable hash. It looked like someone microwaved some leftovers. You don't get that bite-ness that you usually get from stir frying fresh bell peppers or potatoes. Everything was kinda mushed together.   Maybe I came on a bad day. But I was profoundly confused about this place's rating"}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls, crepes and pastries are really fantastic!  One of my favorite breakfast spots when I'm in the mood for sweet breakfast (most times).  You should try \"one of those,\" yup I guess that's what they call 'em.    But I am originally from Washington.  Despite what you may think, most Washingtonians despise Starbucks (unless you are one of the yuppie-types who needs to make some kind of social statement by walking around with an over-roasted, overpriced bitter coffee that needed way too much sugar, syrup or sweetener to make it tolerable in a cup that carries a symbol that states \"the person carrying this cup drives a beemer or wishes they did!\") and most Washingtonians prefer to get our coffee from one of the plentiful smaller, more fairly-priced coffee stands that use far superior coffees from local roasters.  Well this is what Lu Lu's coffee reminds me of.  The coffee here is the best I've had in Vegas, roasted perfectly so it doesn't need crazy amounts of sweetener.  Call my crazy but I like my coffee to taste like coffee, and as a matter of fact, they make the only iced coffee drinks that aren't too sweet for my taste.  A little bit of caramel or vanilla or whatever but you still know you're drinking coffee, and no bitter taste or aftertaste.  Great coffee!  My $.02"}
{"text":"I really like this place. My food is always great. The children almost never eat anything I get them thou. They like the mandarin oranges they get on the side but never really eat the sandwich of quesadilla. The only down side for me is price for portion size. I am almost never full after eating a meal that cost around $10 but it is still great."}
{"text":"Our first time at Lulu's.  We have been in the F&B industry for a while and it's good to see great \"QSC\" Quality, Service and Cleanliness at nice little cafe like this one.  The food was excellent as I had the delicious SOB and my wife had the Stuffed French Toast. They were fresh, flavorful and the bread was so soft and complimented the breakfast sandwich. The price was on point and amazed at how the crew worked together and was always attentive to delivering food, cleaning tables and the spot cleaning the glass doors. The restaurant is decorated beautifully and the soft retro music in the back ground was a nice touch. Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast spot. LOVED the parfait. Enjoyed the breakfast burrito. Orange juice was super fresh. Big fan. Worth the drive from summerlin."}
{"text":"Just wanted to know what all the hoopla was about this place.  It seemed like a quaint place adjacent to Metro, but it just didn't sit well with me.  If you're all about simple, then this place is it, as it has small selection, but nothing too special.  It's definitely not like a Panera.  I've tried the Baguette Cafe which is a simple place too, but find that better suited for me.  The bread seemed to be decent and I've tried others like Bon Breads, but my pick was just a simple muffin only.  It wasn't as oily like muffins usually can me, but had a very healthy overall taste like the one I tried at Baguette Cafe.  Will have to take a pass on this place."}
{"text":"To die for!!! Very hard to find if your using GPS the \"metro pizza\" is LULU... just walk around back and you will see it. Pastries so soft and flakey! Hands down best I have had in Vegas! The French Toast is the best thing I have had in a long time- not over sweet or hard to eat. Fresh apples and whip cream makes you want to lick the plate!  Dog friendly and they even brought us water for them. We enjoyed outdoor seating- made for a romantic feel."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is one of the worst breakfast places I have ever been. A few days ago my wife and I ate at Metro Pizza which is located next door. The Pizza and Service was excellent. Therefore, we decided to try Lulu's for breakfast. My wife asked if they had anything sugar free and she was to told coffee? I asked for a scrambled egg and was told they can't scramble an egg but would break the yolk. And, the cashier had a personality like an armadillo."}
{"text":"My workout friend recommending Lulu's for an amazing breakfast and so we decided to drop in on 05/27/18.   We walk in with no one else in line, I stand there for a few minutes trying to read what I think is the menu. I realized the menus were on paper by where you order. I read over it and the breakfast burrito immediately stands out. I tell the girl taking my order that I would like that breakfast burrito and instead of the eggs if I could get egg whites. She tells me no because the burritos are made in the morning and can't be taken apart and remade ??. I then then order the turkey burger as an alternative.   My 3 friends and I head outside to the patio to enjoy the weather and talk. After about 10 minutes we see a woman get up from her seat angrily and head into the restaurant ........... and another 20 minutes pass and a man also does the same thing ........... sure enough we had to wait 45 MINUTES for our food and this is why everyone was becoming so enraged.   I couldn't bare to see this place on a busy day albeit my turkey burger was pretty decent, the service , wait time, and inability to make alterations were a real turn off for me."}
{"text":"Fair warning, this is not your average breakfast joint. Lulu's presents many creatively inspired options, from the hot breakfasts to the pastries, on down to the signature coffee. Been going regularly for a few years and plan to continue!"}
{"text":"Cute little out of the way place. Very friendly and helpful staff. Had the ham and gruyere tartine and a pumpkin spice latte, both delish. Friends enjoyed the breakfast burrito (huge) and a Hermann sausage, egg, muenster sandwich on pretzel bread."}
{"text":"Living in Vegas 5 months now and never found a great bakery.  Someone recommended Lulu's and we stopped there today.  OMG.   What can I say...Chocolate croissant, pistachio white chocolate shortbread cookies, chocolate chip cookies AND a cinnamon bun all to bring home for the family...and was talked into THE BEST ICED COFFEE EVER - White chocolate/salted caramel  iced latte - new fav!   Cannot believe how fantastic this place is.  Plus, a breakfast and lunch menu that we can't wait to try.  Every baked item is delicious!  Super, super friendly and knowledgeable staff - the cashier (think she is the manager)  is the BEST!  From New Orleans, great, no nonsense, tells it like it is (not abrasive, funny as heck, and being from NJ - love dealing with REAL, down to earth people!).  This is a place that makes you feel at home.  Cafe style, casual, homey...just loved it.  We will be regulars.  Thanks everyone for the great service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at lulus but don't come back often enough. Let me say my husband is not as big of a fan because he is a pancake type of breakfast guy and he isn't into the cafe sandwich type of thing. It's pricey. But yummy. I love getting their benicio pork dish. Very heavy dish. I do wish it was a poached egg instead of fried but that's ok. Restaraunt is shared with metro pizza. Also enjoy their cronut, though it is very sweet but pairs beautifully with coffee. If hubby liked this place we would be here more."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while now. We finally went and I'm a tad bit disappointed. The food was good, but service was bad. The manager was extremely rude to her employees. I felt so bad for them. She would bark an order at them and then put on a fake smile and cash out the next guess. I saw a ton of eye rolls and looks of hatred on the employees faces when she turned her back. The manager called everyone 'Baby'! That's so phony and annoying. Sitting in the restaurant for 30 mins and I must have heard her call someone BABY about 300 times.   The food was great. It took about 15 mins to be brought out though. We were there early and not many people were before us. Don't drink the bottled soda though! My husband got a Diet Coke and it expired in February! It's June!!   Multiple people came in with children and ended up leaving because they don't have a kids menu.  I might try this place again sometime."}
{"text":"This place has thrived so well because they not only offer quality but they also are friendly ever single time! This is my favorite brunch spot to meet my girlfriends for a quiet and quaint atmosphere. The huge windows offer great amounts of sunshine so score a spot by the window and sip on some tea or coffee. My favorite dish is the jive turkey toasted with a side salad. My friend loves the breakfast burrito. Anything you order will be great, I promise."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try. When I walked in, there was no one there to great me and I wondered around for like 2 minutes trying to figure it out. Finally I stood in the middle of the room until someone from the metro pizzas side came in to help me out. She showed me where to order and even explain some of the menu items shown in the case. I ordered the apple raised French toast. After I ordered, I was left to carry all my drink items to the table by myself. I was not offered a tray or even some help.  When the food was ready, it was not brought to me but I was called up to get it myself, and again was offered no help to carry it to my table. Although the food was very tasty I didn't like that I had to ask for cutlery and then I had to get the spoon I asked for myself, after waiting for awhile when it didn't come.  The staff was friendly but not very helpful. The food was decent but the atmosphere left something to be desired I felt like it was a chore to get everything I needed to enjoy my meal. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I decided to check this place out, unaware that it was there. I passed it many times to go to Target, but never noticed it. I'm glad so many people wrote about it, the food was delicious. I ordered the Benecio, wanted something different for breakfast.  The pulled pork was tender with enough flavor. The cornbread was sweet and the hollandaise added so much flavor to the whole meal. I only ate half, it was pretty big. My bf had the pastrami hash, he recommends it. The prices are perfect!! We would have spent more at Denny's and gotten a boring breakfast. I will definitely be returning to try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Lulu's is a great place to take the family for breakfast. For those familiar with Metro Pizza, it'll be obvious that Lulu's is owned by these guys.  They have something for just about every taste. Plenty of eggs, meats, and pastries.   It's cozy and had a nice vibe... Definitely a place you can eat and relax. If you're in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"Really delicious! I've been here twice with a friend and my husband. My friend and I had the Captain America and shared a cinnamon roll while my husband had the Benecio del Porko. I'm weird and don't like eggs and my sandwich was still very sizable despite the lack of eggs. I also ordered potatoes and of course, they were good too. The vanilla iced coffee was perfect for a hot summer morning. The customer service is also great.I've been here twice in less than a week and plan to keep visiting."}
{"text":"Omg get the benecio el porko. I nearly died it was so delish. The Nutella croissant is amazing too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this place for the first time being that were new to the area and we have heard great things about it. Upon entering we were greeted by a voice from the corner letting us know the menus are \"over there.\" Mind you they were not busy. I proceeded to the cashier where I said \"excuse me are the booths over there part of lulu's as well( keeping in mind I have never been)\".The elderly lady rudely says\" uh yes\". I asked if we can sit over there. She says in a rude and unkind way that\" you can sit over there after you go over there and place your order.\" She not once lifting her head only looking up through her glasses. I put her paper menu down and walked out. Instead of explaining how lulu's works ,obviously I don't know ,she barks at me. Lost my appetite and will not return.  Lulu is rude!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Food is delicious. Perfect for a nice weekend breakfast. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The location is beautiful it is a bit far for me, but it's worth the drive the staff here are always so nice and friendly and the most important... the food! It's frickin good I totally recommend everyone to try there 305 Cuban style sandwich  it comes with Cuban coffee which it's like the amount of two expresso shots and you get a side of a spring salad (mixed greens with a vinaigrette) or chips, it's a really good value for the  portions of the sandwich its huge and you'll crave it when your thinking about a sandwich! On this trip I also tried an almond milk toffee nut latte and it was good they definitely have good coffee here. Like I said the portion is big so me and my boyfriend like to split the Cuban sandwich and then we'll order another sandwich to try and this time we tried the grilled cheese which came with Brie cheese, cranberry, turkey and bacon it was a great sandwich but I'm not used to that different cheese so at the last bite of that sandwich the cheese became too much for me but that was just me being weird, But the staff was nice enough to plate us our sandwiches spit since we were sharing. So if your thinking about coming here you need too!"}
{"text":"Lulu's is the Northwest's answer to yummy breakfast without having to wait 45 minutes at some restaurant. We've eaten here several times, and every time it has been delicious. Some of our favorites: - the country tartine-- french bread, poached eggs, ham and hollandaise-- WOW - the Benecio del Porko -- cornbread, pulled bbq pork, eggs, hollandaise -- tasty! - stuffed french toast-- cinnamon apples and syrup- yumyumyumyum! -spinach, sundried tomato & feta fritatta - a favorite  The best part about this place is they make bread on-site and their baker(s) is/are PASSIONATE about bread. Following them on Facebook gives you an inside peek at loaves ready for the oven, or their next pastry creation. The \"one of those\" creation, a pastry cream-filled fried croissant, is pretty good, but I love their turnovers and almond croissant-- we never leave without taking a pastry or two home for snack time later!  When we can't stop in for breakfast or brunch we'll go and get one of their breakfast sandwiches for the road-- so much more filling and tasty than the drive-thru special. The best part of these sandwiches and paninis is, though, the homemade bread.  Speaking of bread-- take some home with you. Especially at the holidays, their pumpkin seed cranberry bread with maple butter is to-die-for and made out Thanksgiving table that much more yummier."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff.  It's worth trying their French toast.  We ordered the peach blueberry and the King.  The peach blueberry is delicious, but the King is amazing! Peanut butter, the banana and the bacon YUM!"}
{"text":"i would consider lulu's to be my favorite local breakfast joint and bakery. i'm ecstatic that they're in my neighborhood!  lulu's started out as a food truck called \"lulu's on the move\". i never had the pleasure of trying them out then but i'd heard so many great things so, of course, was extremely happy to hear that they were opening a brick and mortar in our neighborhood. it took some time, as most restaurants do, but they finally opened. we've since had many a breakfast/brunch there.  walking into lulu's gives you the sense that you've left las vegas. the decor and ambiance make you feel like you're in the pacific northwest or something which is appropriate considering lulu's is in northwest Las Vegas. i absolutely love that. and with the smell of fresh baked bread emanating from their bakery, i could just stay there for hours.  the restaurant is set-up like your typical bakery/deli/cafe. you order and pay at the counter, they give you a table sign, you sit wherever you like and they bring your food to your table. it's not full service but the service you do get is always friendly and fast.  i've had the opportunity to sample many of their offerings and some of my favorites are:  Frittatas Tartines Hashes Guava croissant is the biz Raisin custard roll Cronuts Cookies Basically anything from their bakery is delicious!  If you haven't had a chance to yet, come visit the Las Vegas northwest for a little comfort food and baked goodness at lulu's."}
{"text":"the first time I came to this restaurant, I adored everything about it. that was because the presumed owner wasn't working this particular day. Today I returned expecting the same great service and atmosphere, only to be snapped at by said \"owner\" for no reason. super unprofessional, and also there was a medium length blonde/white hair in my sandwich. I didn't even bother going back to complain because I just knew the manager would have challenged me and would've made a scene, not worth it. due to this woman, I will not be returning for a third time.   In short, go to another cafe. you'll get treated better and also won't have to see first hand how management mistreats their employees."}
{"text":"We have been 4 weekends in a row! This place is amazing. Excellent pastries, great iced coffee, and delicious brunch items. The \"one of those\" and french onion grilled cheese stand out as favorites. I highly recommend this place. Aside from a few \"kinks\" (occasional lack of communication between staff members resulting in food being given to other tables, forgetting to give you pastries when you order, etc.) this place is close to perfect. The atmosphere is warm and friendly and the location is fairly convenient. I have already recommended this place to friends and family and will be returning often."}
{"text":"Thank you, Lulu's, for baking the most delicious guava croissants! I usually request a guava and cream cheese turnover from my favorite Cuban bakery in south Florida when my parents come to Las Vegas for a visit, so it is nice to have a little taste of home just minutes away when I crave it.  I'm also in love with their loaves of chocolate bread. They do offer chocolate muffins, but the cocoa-colored yeast dough loaded with rich, dark chocolate chips and dried cherries is a real treat. It would make amazing bread pudding if you find yourself with leftovers, but that is an unlikely occurrence, unless you plan ahead and buy extra! I enjoyed the cannoli embedded in the center of the cannoli cupcake, but the cake itself could have been more flavorful. Their regular coffee is tasty and strong, which I certainly appreciate.  The manager, chef, and employees are very friendly and enthusiastic, which enhances the experience. The cafe is attached to Metro Pizza in the northwest. I love the look of the brick walls and chandelier on the ceiling, but the large windows make some of the seating uncomfortable. I felt like I needed to wear sunglasses inside the dining area. I'm excited to return and sample a sandwich and some sides from their lunch menu! Lulu earns extra cookie points for her kids' happy hour,  with half price cookies and milk from 2:30pm to 4:00pm."}
{"text":"I always forgot that this place existed but then one night while at Metro Pizza next door I noticed a coupon on the bottom of my receipt for $1 off coffee and decided to check it out the next morning. They have several espresso drinks to choose from and I had the caramel macchiato which was really good.   While checking out their baked goods I was offered some samples of bread and cookies cut up on little pieces. Their cookies are delicious, nice and crunchy with good flavor but not too sweet. I took some cookies and macarons to go. Noticed that they have a full breakfast menu but I didn't have time to sit down and try it. Guess I'll have to come back for that next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing I do not know what else to say. If you are a foodie you will be blown away. Very busy in the AM but a mid morning or afternoon snack and drink would be a treat. They have a computerized espresso machine, I am a purist and prefer a hand packed model, so I didn't try the coffee, but I will give it a whirl next time."}
{"text":"This place is all types of outstanding. I took my mom when she came to visit me and we were utterly impressed with this place. The manager greeted with a very spunk and welcoming demeanor. The employee were delightful and helpful. Ooh yeah, the food, it was amazing. I had the stuffed french toast and my mom had a sandwich made with turkey in which she stated was very tender and juicy. I had a specialty iced coffee which was refreshing and tasty. I will definitely go back and try additional menu items which i saw others devouring."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go on the weekend. Lots of coffee options and the cinnamon rolls are fantastic. Beware the yogurt is addicting."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Been there a few times and it never disappoints.  Great food, awesome staff and cool building.  My favorite place in the area!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good. We all enjoyed it. It's a bit on the pricey side for breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"So great! Real café feel to it mixed with feeling like I am eating at a family members house. Very great vibe and killer food. I got the raspberry&peach french toast. I was expecting fruit filled/topped french toast but noooo. This was legit. Definately no fake fillings. The fruit is baked in perfectly to this beautiful piece of bread!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Las Vegas. Tastes like authentic home cooking. Everyone is so nice & the atmosphere is really welcoming. Not often you pay less for a more superior product & service. Ill choose this place over the other local breakfast spots every time."}
{"text":"Great homemade breakfast kinda place. Lots of love put into everything from the creme filled croissants to the blanket of flavored hollandaise over pulled pork and corn bread (Benicio del porko). We also ordered a egg sandwich called a 'Captain America' where I opted for the 'over hard' style egg which was basically a traditional egg sandwich on a toasted sweet bread roll, veggies, and cheese but was portioned and seasoned exquisitely. When a simple dish impresses me, I know it's that kinda place.  The attention to detail was greatly apparent throughout every item and I clearly realized it when I saw that even the cornbread had perfect grill marks. This was especially impressive because the cornbread is covered in several scrumptious layers of so many other things. Most dishers will get lazy and skip this step thinking it's a waste of time but I assure you it isn't. That simple detail solidified the idea of pride and joy of that plate, and the entire establishment, which speaks volumes to a former chef like me.  I would recommend to anyone in the area looking for a smart, country style yet classy type joint to stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"It was worth the try I guess ?  Nothing thrilling about this place. It was an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! There items are really interesting. I had there Bbq Pork Benedict and it was one if the best breakfasts I have ever had. Good coffee. Small, cozy place with really good service."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  This coffee house/restaurant is so unique and so pretty. I always feel welcomed and their pastries are fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to try it out for our first time.. No wonder why everyone always tells us that we have to try it.. Omg! The food was delish! I've never had breakfast like this before. They're bread was fresh and tasteful. Their service was amazing too. They always ask you if you're doing ok and they keep up with everything. I give it 4 stars because the wait time is pretty long but when you get your food the time is worth it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on our way home from Vegas. It's a long drive and while we weren't worried about time, we were time conscious. After waiting over 25 minutes for our order, I went to the counter and asked only to be told that we would have to wait another 20 minutes. I pointed out that several tables that were larger than ours and had arrived later were already eating at which time she said they'd try to finish in 10 minutes. I had watched as she checked several places for our order slip and was fairly certain that some mistake had been made, but they insisted that the kitchen was behind and understaffed. After I asked about the food, it only room them another 5 minutes or so to get it out and it was certifiably delicious. They also brought us two pastries in apology for the slowness. We were to stuffed to eat the pastries right away, but they were also fabulous.   If not for the slow down in food delivery, this would have been a 5 star breakfast. If they had admitted the mistake immediately and gotten our food out to us the way they did, AND computed us the pastries, it would have been hard to decide between 4 and 5 stars. But they never admitted the mistake even after making profuse apologies and giving us the pastries, which makes it hard for me to decide between 3 and 4 stars. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely go back, but I love hundreds of miles away and might not want to risk spending over an hour getting a counter service breakfast no matter how delicious it might be."}
{"text":"Good food, nice place, friendly people. Just a little pricey, I would recommend. The captain America and the sloppy Jose are recommended."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and oh my was it heavenly!  Had a croissant while we waited for our food.  A friend and I shared the Benecio del porko.  It was grilled corn bread topped with pulled pork, eggs and hollandaise sauce, garnished with BBQ sauce, corn and cilantro.    It was perfection.    The prices are reasonable and you couldn't ask for a friendlier staff.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really would have liked to like this place but nothing here really makes sense. The ordering system just doesn't make sense. The seating is also weird. You can't sit in the adjoining restaurant but not all the way in there. The wait was extremely long for food with small portions. The frittata was awful and dry. Don't waste your time if in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! I had the Tuscan Brie Grilled Cheese for $10 and it came with a mini salad -- the food was fantastic and was outweighed only by the friendly staff. They all made my girlfriend and I feel super welcome and suggested their favorite items on the menu. Do yourself a favor and stop by (-:"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos were super delish. I highly recommend them. I also got a raison somethi g pastry. Not sure of the name but wow! Super flavorful as well. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"The food was great. A step up from the normal breakfasts. Unique and great tasting. . Our first time but definitely coming back. ."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this little place not too long ago and finally got to try it out thismorning. It's a nice little cafe style place. You go in, order and pay for your do Is at the counter and then they bring it to your seat when it's ready. They have a window of pastries to choose from or you can order something off the menu. They have a separate coffee menu too since they have so many flavors. They think highly of our troops and military families so if you are, let them know for your discount. The staff is super nice.  My boyfriend tried one of the iced coffees and said it was pretty good. He also tried the breakfast burrito and said it was pretty good. I had my heart set on one thing and one thing only, there. The Benecio Del Porko or the Pork Benedict. It was so good. I'm not a big fan of bbq sauce so I'd definitely try to get it with less sauce if I could next time, but it was delicious. Shredded bbq pork on top of big pieces of cornbread topped off with an egg and hollandaise sauce. Mmmm.....it was a pretty large portion as well. I'd definitely reccomend trying it."}
{"text":"Excellent food run by a very nice staff.  Food is fresh & creative - not your typical common fare."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of addicting! Seriously I have been here three times and each time I fall more in love with it. The first time coming here I had the Benecio Del Porko. The second and third times I had my mind set on trying something different like one of their breakfast sandwiches but the benecio just called my name and I had to have it again and again. The benecio is basically a thick cloud sent straight down from the heavens (aka their delicious cornbread) topped with a hearty portion of bbq pulled pork and over easy eggs cascaded with their liquid gold hollandaise sauce. Everything about this dish is amazing and the flavors tie together seamlessly. Besides this beauty of a dish, Lulus has great coffee and prices. Their drip coffee is self serve- aka free refills and is super smooth and delicious.   If you haven't made a trip here yet come for a weekend brunch and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The entrance is street faced but very cosy inside. The owner was really nice and gave us a free pastry as we left after overhearing that we wanted to try it upon closure. Their most popular dish that also got awarded best of Las Vegas is the Benicio del Porko, something else, and the mixed arugula balsamic tartine. The Benicio was good and not dry at all, the tartine was my dish and was fresh and the bread was buttery and a little hard to cut into but savory, and the something else was flaky and buttery as well while the mushrooms were nicely seasoned. I wouldn't mind returning to try this place again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere good food, and the coffee is amazing! I bought the beans for home and they are now my favorite blend."}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious with every visit. Menu is always evolving. No matter what your choosing, anything on the menu is great. This is the perfect spot for breakfast and bottomless coffee! The food and baked goods are always fresh. My only complaint is that they display their entire menu in a display case, and yes it's real food. I think it would be more cost-efficient if they had photos of the food. I asked the girl at the counter, \"Does someone actually make ALL this food every morning just for display?\" \"Yes\" was her reply. I surely hope that food doesn't go to waste and it probably does since it's sitting there until they close. *sigh*"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite breakfast place! The food is delicious and the service is usually pretty good, too. They have a great menu and we love sitting on the patio outside. We go to breakfast or brunch here at least a couple times a month - sometimes more! The bread is the best."}
{"text":"Lucky enough to be in Lulu's neighborhood for a second and was again very impressed.  Tried the \"Dirty Chips\", toscano bread, and variety of cookies (white chocolate pistachio, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, and Lulu's signature chocolate pretzel).  Dirty chips were beautifully prepared and full of flavor, the toscano bread high quality and stayed fresh for 3 days, and the cookies were all top notch.  Service was again awesome.  I need to plan more trips from Henderson to the northwest side of town...only I wish gasoline prices were lower!"}
{"text":"This is a really neat store. Came in with the family and was craving delicious pastries. I ordered the cheese danish and my wife ordered the chocolate crescent. I had a hazelnut latte and everyone else had water. The service is very good, and the staff always seem to be doing something. The atmosphere feels like a cool place you would find in San Francisco, but we are fortunate enough to have it here!"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious 5 stars, what more can i say ?!?! The weekends offer specials but the standard fare is delicious also. I've tried almost everything and I have never been disappointed. The staff is amazing, i recommend a signature latte and the croissant."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast or brunch.  They share a place with a pizza joint so seating is kind of weird but totally worth it.  When you place your order, they'll give you some bread to sample while you are waiting.  You just can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Next time we're in Vegas we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Lulu's from the eclectic decor to the yummy food.  My husband and I love coming here on weekends. The coffee never seems to disappoint.  The smores latte, white mocha, and pumpkin are some of my favorites.  Hubby gets black coffee and enjoys it.  My go to is the Benecio Del Porko because its delicious and so different from what you can get at other restaurants.  Hubs usually gets the pastrami hash because it is that good.  The nutella croissant is to die for!  Sometimes we order \"one of those\" as a little breakfast appetizer...they are the best thing ever (they are sometimes the winning argument when we are deciding which breakfast restaurant to go to). The Captain America breakfast sandwich is a good choice too.  My husband things it's a little too salty, but I think it's just fine.  Lulu's Breakfast Burrito is a winner also.  The mix of flavors and the roast pork seem to set this apart from run of the mill breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Had a lunch special here. The aroma of fresh bread here is amazing!! Interesting menu selections and drink (coffee) selections were too many to choose from. The quaint interior is done well and cozy. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and cozy inside. We went and ordered a couple of sandwiches and sat down. I see a lot of complaints about the woman ringing up the food. We didn't have any issue with her lol. I gave 3 stars because we waited over 50 minutes for our two breakfast sandwiches"}
{"text":"If you are coming for croissants then you will be fine, otherwise be prepared for breakfast meals prepared with indulgent displays in mind rather than taste.  The cinnamon rolls are half icing and half croissant with cinnamon somewhere in there.   The breakfast burrito has plenty of stuff inside but all you will taste is cheese and pepper.   If you stick with the basic egg sandwiches like the Captain America or Farmhouse then you will come away mildly satisfied since they don't mess these up too badly.   Otherwise you are better off at the dozens of other restaurants in a five mile radius that serve better breakfast."}
{"text":"Place was good. Little disappointed in my dish, however the environment was friendly."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have eaten here. It is not close so I can't come up here often but anytime I'm near here in the AM I eat here. I get the breakfast burrito with a verde sauce it's the best and I won't get anything else it's so good! My wife and in laws are each getting the benicio del porko.     A version of eggs Benedict brought to a whole different level of awesomeness. Prices are great for what you get."}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice. Always helpful. The food  has just a bit of an odd twist. About to tuck into peach raspberry French Toast. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Found my spot. Friendly staff, amazing food, and they all loved my dog (patio tables available). All wins in my book."}
{"text":"Every time we've visited lulu's the service has been excellent, the owner is friendly and makes you feel welcome. The food is always delicious, my favorite is the yogurt parfait, I don't know what they do to the yogurt, but it's more like whip cream, tastes like desert for breakfast. The burrito is also great, unlike any breakfast burrito I've ever had, we go at least once a week"}
{"text":"Omg I had the apple and raisin stuffed French toast, it's like bread pudding, it was so delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nutella Stuffed Croissant...need I say more?  Stopped in here on our way out of town for a quick bite to eat.  Was not disappointed with the Nutella Stuffed Croissant that everyone raved about.  Wished that I had more time to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I had read about and came specifically for their 'One of Those' a cross between a croissant and a donut filled with pastry cream. The outside was the perfect pastry flakiness and very tasty and they aren't skimpy on the cream filling. It can be messy to eat. I'm glad I had one but I don't think I'll have another.  What I really enjoyed was their fabulous roast beef sandwich on their homemade bread. This wasn't deli meat. It was as if they sliced a piece off a slab of recently roasted beef especially for my sandwich. That and the horseradish mustard, tangy cheddar cheese, friendly service and price will definitely bring me back. It's a good thing for my waistline they aren't closer."}
{"text":"Located in a quiet part of Centennial Hills, this quaint breakfast, brunch and lunch joint is a new favorite! We never find ourselves in this part of town since it's further north from all of our weekend activities, but I'm so glad we went out of our way this past weekend to try this spot! The café is rustic and charming with an old school, classic vibe to it.   The employees all seemed very eager to help and sweet. After we looked through the menu, we went to the counter to place our order. The lady running the register was the manager; she was quite the character, very enthusiastic and called us baby throughout the process (with a sweet, but animated southern charm.)  We decided to get an iced chai latte and requested that it be \"extra spicy.\" We saw the manager/cashier make it in front of us from of a liquid/syrup blend and not from powder. We also had it topped off with whipped cream and cinnamon. It was very sweet at first, but as the ice melted, it was tasty! My fiancé and I enjoyed it. Rated: 4/5  We also shared the Benicio del Porko - Corn bread topped with succulent pulled pork, BBQ & hollandaise sauce, poached eggs and a sprinkle of more sweet corn! Wowza! One of the tastiest & creative benedicts I have ever had. The portion was generous and definitely stuffed the two of us. The corn bread was not too dense and slightly crisp on the bottoms, like they had tossed it on the grill for a bit. Also, the pulled pork was wonderfully moist! A slight complaint was the BBQ sauce overwhelmed the overall flavor of the hollandaise, but when eaten sparingly in the \"perfect bite\" it adds a nice pop of flavor, complementing the dish! Rated: 4/5   I also saw some menu items and pastries that looked fantastic and unique. I'm looking forward to coming back to try their creative sandwiches as well!"}
{"text":"The food was done well. Great presentation and flavors. The portions were large so no sides or add ons needed. Bottomless cup of coffee always wins my heart over. I cannot wait to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"First of all- WOW. Just had the best eggs Benedict in my life. If you're in the area, you gotta stop by. Oh and they make great drinks too."}
{"text":"Now THIS is a GREAT place for food!!  Staff is extremely helpful.  Robin greeted us as it was our first time and explained EVERY dish to us.  Love her Southern charm!  The food was excellent and the coffee was COFFEE...not that Starbucks nonsense!!  Breads and pastries are very tasty.  Nice to find a place with very educated staff, excellent dishes that you can NOT find in McDonalds for breakfast!!  We are now REGULARS!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here almost every weekend for a few years now and not once have I had a bad experience not only with the food but as well as the staff. It feels so homey and everyone is just so nice and friendly.   ++++ Brioche bun sandwhiches with fresh OJ is perfect for a slight hangover! Wished they would bring back the chocken chorizo one but every thing else is good!"}
{"text":"Hi there, we went here for brunch time and I had a burrito with egg and pork...not so good  my hubby had a captain America and said it was really good.. we bought some bakery items..palmier was great. the almond croissant was really good, they said they make their own croissant dough.. better than that bakery sugar bee's bakery in the southwest that buys their croissants frozen from pramel.. the macaroons were good but not sure what the flavor was? I have never had a macaroon that was soft and tender like that.. it was delicious.. and only 1.25.  I will definitely be back for the almond croissant......"}
{"text":"Lulus is my go to neighborhood coffee spot and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good coffee and relaxed enviroment to spend some time thinking. Mommies - I'm talking to you.  At $4 - $6 for a Latte - Its totally affordable and the over all good vibes from the staff keeps me coming back. I can't even tell you how many meet ups I've hosted here. Each time I have a 5 Star experience. My biggest tip is try the Macarons!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place- but my first encounter with Lulu's fell a little flat. Very cute little breakfast cafe offering pasteries, fresh bread, aromatic coffee, and made to order breakfast dishes. I was like a kid in a pastry store drooling over all the goodies- macaroons, croissants, holiday bread, yum!   The skinny Lulu: was a breakfast sandwich using their soft roll with egg whites, grilled asparagus, and red pepper pesto and shavings of cheese. I can go on and on about their soft roll- it was amazing. The bread was light and fuffy, but also warm and crunchy, lots of volume but not too dense. Bravo to the bread. The cons- the portions of the eggs/asparagus was very scant. The asparagus was more like little shards, hidden here and there. Cheese?? Couldn't find any. The best part was prob the pesto. Too much bread vs not enough filling ratio. My husband's sandwich suffered from the same problem- he ordered the Farmhouse.   Macaroons-- maybe these were stale?? Bit into one and it was very hard on the inside. Had the consistency of chewing bubblegum.... Not pleasant. And at $1.25 a piece- stung a lot.  Pumpkin latte- was very good! Love seasonal drinks. Order a large cause you'll finish it all :)"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Food is yummy and fresh. Out of the 4 times  I've been there only once did I think what I ordered was just ok. It came with salad and bread that was absolutely awesome though. The Benicio Del Porko and the Pastrami Hash are two standout favorites. The orange juice and lemonade are fresh squeezed and the regular coffee is delicious. I just recently tried the pastries that they offer and they were just as decadent. This place is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The food was terrific, probably the best breakfast food I've ever had!!! However, the lady at the cash register seemed quite mean with her employees. I would definitely still come here though!"}
{"text":"Fresh to order. This is our first time here and we like it. It wasn't busy so we ordered right away after deciding what we wanted. The have a daily menu and a weekend menu - great choices. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Stopped by LuLu's for a late breakfast! Upon entering we were immediately greeted, the waitress then explained the ordering  process and where we were able to sit. The ordering style is very unique for a breakfast spot, I liked how we're were able to see a display of food that was available to order. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful in explaining everything, and answered the many questions that we had, as first time diners. I must say that menu is very unique  from other breakfast spots in town. I ordered the Bumbah sandwich with my eggs over medium, and my boyfriend  ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich . We each got a side of potatoes, 2$ extra how can you pass that up! The prices are so reasonable! We actually only ordered one side, the waiter gave us another on the  house, once I saw the size, and realized it was too small, and wanted my own. They also offer fresh squeezed orange juice, and a variety of sweets and pastries to choose from ! Today we had happen to arrive late, so there wasn't much to chose from, but next time I will definitely look forward to trying the cinnamon roll.   Overall I really  enjoyed my sandwich, it was something that I wouldn't normally eat but I was very happy with it!  Only negatives are the potatoes, they were super plain and small!  I would like to add, that if you are a picky eater, and wanted something plain and traditional, like the French toast , it's already stuffed so you do not have that option. Overall LuLu's is great place! I suggest adding it your list, if you want to try something different , that is not your typical every day breakfast place! Great vibes,very quaint, and extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and cannot wait to go back.  Lulu's has incredible food, the most lovely staff, and is so affordable!  Best spot for a delicious breakfast if you're in this area.  We drove there all the way from Henderson, so worth it!  The first time my sister and I went, I got the pastrami hash and a chai latte.  Hands down BEST chai latte I've had and a huge plate!  So good, we finished everything and almost got another chai to go (too full though so we vowed to return ASAP).  My parents are in town for the holidays so we took them there yesterday for breakfast before a hike at Red Rock.  My mom didn't want to leave!  She suffers from colitis and can only eat certain typed of bread - this place has the best homemade bread, she wanted to buy out their loaves to take home to TX.  They were out due to the holidays, but we are going back in a few days so she can have some to take home.  I got the daily tartine this time (ham and gruyere) and of course, a chai latte.  The rest of my family got various breakfast sandwiches and lattes, all were so happy.  We got a huge cinnamon role to go...WOW.  All of this for about $45!  Highly recommend this spot.  I wish there was one closer to Henderson!  Maybe one day :)"}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING! I've never had such a good breakfast sandwich, will be back indefinitely. If I lived closer, I'd probably be there every day."}
{"text":"Food was descent and coffee was good. It's easy to go right past it as it's connected to the Pizza place. We passed it twice because the driveway we entered had no visual sign on it and when you exit the driveway on Skypointe Drive all you see is the Pizza sign. They are connected and share a dining area. Will be back now that we know where it is and how to get in."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick, but high quality,  breakfast.  I don't really understand the negative reviews claiming subpar dishes. Everything we had was fresh and flavorful. Most items are common on breakfast menus, but are actually extremely unique in flavor. As long as you keep an open mind, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Had the apple stuffed french toast twice, both times its been great. My picky two year old daughter loves it as well. The breads are great, been happy with all of the food we have had here."}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't waist your time or money. Waited an hour for the food which ended up being such a disappointment! Horrible, disgusting and way overpriced."}
{"text":"So I just put the first few bites of the pulled pork Benedict...I was so blown away by the flavors that I actually stopped eating so I could capture the flavors on Yelp!!   The corn bread (clearly made from scratch, which seems consistent with the entire menu) is fantastic. Light with just a little crunch. The chunks of corn are a delightful texture and change of pace. The BBQ pulled pork is flavorful and goes well with the corn bread and hollandaise. The eggs are cooked correctly (though they aren't able to poach eggs) and the drizzle of BBQ sauce completes this amazing dish!!!  My wife got the pastrami hash and was impressed but said there was a little too much fennel at times.   My son had one of the breakfast sandwiches which I tried and was also quite impressed. Quality bacon and amazing bread, really great flavor!  As you can see by my 5 star score I will be back when I am in the area!!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic breakfast at this local eatery. The flavors and textures were wonderful and the prices are reasonable. The staff was wonderful and full of smiles. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Besides the cashier being rude and grumpy to her coworkers and even the customers, the food wasn't half bad. Her snotty remarks make anyone not want to come back. Thanks to the gentleman cashier for being professional and trying to make our experience some what pleasant."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! The service is fast and friendly! I had a twist on eggs Benedict that was pulled pork on corn bread covered in hollandaise sauce that came with a side of home Potatoes. It was delicious! The portion was generous and I had to stop myself from devouring the entire thing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The manager is really rude and acts like you're putting her out by asking her questions. I get the feeling that's her shtick. She probably thinks people like it but she comes off as mean and bitter to most people I know."}
{"text":"They have really good breakfast sandwiches here. I've gone during the week and it was nice and quick and delicious. I went this past weekend on Saturday and my husband and I waited 55min for two breakfast sandwiches which is why I am giving 2 stars. There's no reason it should take that long for two sandwiches."}
{"text":"My wife and I accidentally walked into this place a few weeks ago, on our way into Metro pizza which is next door to it (By the way we had a horrible experience at Metro pizza, but that's for a different review). We decided to come back to Lulu's and check it out sometime.   We did this morning. It was wonderful. The service was great and the place has a comfortable feel. We went for Sunday brunch and, while the place was busy, there was little to no wait to order and get our food.  We ordered only two items. We got the breakfast burrito and a pastry called \"one of those\". The breakfast burrito was by far the best breakfast burrito I've had in my life! It is stuffed with scrambled eggs, carnitas, black beans, sauce, and pepper jack cheese. Then it's grilled and smothered in chili verde sauce. Wow! It was heavenly. The pastry was a flaky pastry stuffed with custard. It was very good but a little too much custard in it for my taste. The coffee was also good. I highly recommend trying the breakfast burrito here.  We will be back to try the other items."}
{"text":"The restaurant is overall great. Wonderful pastries, incredible lattes, and service is always great. The only thing I'm not particularly fond of is there a very large meal portion size. more often than not I can only comfortably eat half of what I'm presented which makes me feel bad for throwing away the other half. I would prefer that they offered smaller or at least half portions"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a whim.  Being we hadn't been there before we weren't sure on what to expect.  It seemed as if this place was a sit and order type place but it's not.  You order at counter with the help of some great visual aids...preserved meals on display.  Nice touch.  And thank goodness for that because the old lady behind the counter with gray hair and the butch haircut was EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful.  She seemed to not want to be there and rushed us through as fast as possible and it was pretty slow with only 2 other tables sat.  I decided to go with the benecio del porko which had some great flavors and would of been amazing had it been warm throughout, and minus the parchment paper I had to pick out of the middle.  Things happen, we're all human, so I'd give this place another shot.... but then i remember Cruella and ya know.... I think I'll stay away! Good thing metro Pizza is right next door!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very slow service. This is the second time we have dined here and while we enjoy the food, it took forever (45 min) to have the food delivered to the table. When I inquired about the time, the older lady behind the register snapped \"It is Saturday.\" I understand being busy, but please set the expectation when a customer orders. Maybe larger scale cooking equipment might help."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at Lulu's bread and breakfast. I went in last Saturday and left when the manager in charge started yelling at all her employees and also didn't explain how long the wait was going to be .. it was almost an hour. It was very unprofessional coming from a manager. I even watched her send someone home. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! Breakfast is always on point! Staff is also very friendly. Their pastries are delicious."}
{"text":"YUM! I'm a breakfast / brunch type person so this hit the spot after our excursion to Gilcrease Orchards.   It's located inside/adjacent to Metro Pizza. It's the same building as Metro Pizza... let's put it that way with its own entrance. I had the Pork Benedict and my hubby had the Pastrami Hash. Both were excellent.   My pork benedict was on top of 2 generous sized portions of THE BEST CORNBREAD.  I'd order just the cornbread next time and be happy. This dish is an all-day-er.  Meaning... you eat it and you don't have to eat again all day. (Kinda.) It does fill ya up. The pork is tender... the sauce they use on it is a little on the sweet side... I'd prefer something with a bit of a kick or at least a bit tangier.  That's just me though. The eggs were a little over done for \"over easy\" but I'm not doing to dock any stars for that.  The yolks were still mostly runny.  The Fresh OJ is sooooooo good!!!  FRESH and SWEET with a hint of pulp.  We didn't try the pastries but they looked quite yummy.  If this place was closer to me, I'd be here every weekend.   Alas...... this is like on the other side of the valley from me.  Probably a good thing."}
{"text":"S.o.b breakfast sandwich is a must try!! My boyfriend had the pastrami hash which was also very good. Nutella croissant was to die for definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I finally made the trek to Reno for brunch the other day...ok not technically Reno but when you live by the strip it's one hell of a trek to get up to Lulu's! But I will say it was well worth journey.  I started with One Of Those their take on a cronut, it was my first Cronut experience and I was very impressed, it was flaky, filled with cream, and all sorts of delicious. I also had The Herman which was a sausage and egg sandwich with mustard and muenster cheese served on a pretzel roll. And a few other dishes that were all delicious but escape my mind right now.  The only thing that will keep me from eating here daily and gaining a thousand pounds is the fact that I can't get up to that side of town daily.   I was a big fan of their truck and I'm glad to see that Chef Chris and crew are only making things bigger and better in their Brick and Mortar!"}
{"text":"Food is soooo yummy and I love the feel and look of the place. Good place to have some brunch and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Sorry took so long to review. I have to say I would never again eat there. It was absolutely disgusting. I had the breakfast pastrami hash dish and it was unbelievably gross. It was sweet instead of savory (which was weird how they hid the saltyness of the pastrami). The vegetables were so over cooked that they were mushy. The only thing that was cooked correctly was the egg.  How they get the rave reviews is beyond me."}
{"text":"Grilled turkey with hot pepper jack cheese, bacon, red onion, lettuce. Seriously one of the best sandwiches. Bread was amazing. Real turkey meat NOT  lunchmeat. Service was so genuine. I'm visiting friend but will come back here again!!'"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and tasty. This is truly a go-to place for breakfast with friends. Food is good, Robin is friendly and the staff is helpful.   We had the breakfast burrito and the Tartine with large hazelnut lattes. Very good. No need for Starbucks with lattes this good.   Her croissants were also great. Reminded me of what I had in France. Had a hazelnut version and my wife had the almond. Again, right up to par."}
{"text":"This place is great and the spunky lady at the counter is great too, I'm not sure why people are so sensitive."}
{"text":"attached to the metro pizza this bread and breakfast spot is a true gem they obviously bake their own bread daily....the chocolate cherry bread was amazing we shared a eggs benedict that had a corn bread bottom, pulled pork and a perfectly cooked over easy egg.....gamechanger!!!! the nutella pastry was amazing definately worth the trip"}
{"text":"This is a cute little breakfast spot. Very nice decor and cute little tables. The customer service is on point. Very friendly and homey. The food is great as well. They have regular and vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"Gosh, I cannot say enough good things about Lulu's. Having accidentally discovered it one morning, it quickly became hands down my favorite place to eat breakfast in all of Las Vegas. The menu is delightfully unique with an array of sweets and savories for any of your early morning cravings. Among my personal favorites is the Breakfast Burrito - which is like no monster I've tackled before - stuffed with tender pork, corn, eggs, and creamy cheese, topped off with a green verde sauce. HOLY YUM.  The Benicio is a whole other delicious beast - and if you're a meat eater and want to have the best damn breakfast of your life, order this. It is two pieces of vibrant yellow grilled cornbread, topped with moist and savory BBQ pulled pork, further topped with two eggs any way, then drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Mother. Of. God. May the brunch gods just take me away on the wings of this heavenly meal.  I won't even get started on the sweet treats that they have. The Cinnamon roll being amongst my favorites - with a layer of icing so thick you could swim in it.  Goodness... Pardon me, I'm suddenly feeling hungry..."}
{"text":"All in all the brunch here was very good. Pricing was great, food was very unique and delicious. Their coffee was very good as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the lady at the register was pretty grumpy and gave the feeling like she was doing me a favor by taking the order.  Other then that I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Lulu's website advertises that they serve nothing pre made but after speaking with an employee I found out most of the food they serve is pre made.   I ordered:  Skinny lulu- don't know why it is called skinny when they use a large brioche bun, eggs were pre cooked   Frittata- no flavor, also pre prepared and most likely microwaved to order, accompanied by a side salad that was soaked in dressing   Harvest spinach salad- ingredients were skimpy and balsamic dressing entirely too biter   By the taste and texture of both the skinny lulu and frittata it was clear to see most items are pre prepared then reheated to order. Lulu's would be better off if they invested in proper kitchen equipment so they can make more of their food to order."}
{"text":"Cute setup, but a little too 'sweet'...and I Like sweet.  I got their newest breakfast plate, which was a mix of sweet and savory. Cornbread in syrup, topped with chicken sausage, apple compote topped with savory mashed potatoes and over easy eggs. The best part was the sausage. Also the lulu signature latte was cocoa, salted caramel. Too sweet. Husband loved his Farmhouse breakfast sandwich, and our waiter was a great guy. Fun experience, wait time did tip us into the 3/5 category."}
{"text":"Finally writing this. I have been going to LuLu's since day one. This is like the Cheers of bakeries, \"where everybody knows your name.\" The staff is always amazing. Your greeted with a smile and welcomed to taste what they are sampling that day.   Now, this is not your run of the mill breakfast joint, so don't go and expect pancakes and biscuits and gravy(but it wouldn't surprise me if that showed up on the specials one day). Lulu's offers everything from fresh baked bread and pastries to a killer green chili pork breakfast burrito(by far my favorite daily item).  The bread is soft and delectable, the pastry is flaky, and the cookies are to die for. If going for breakfast, you can't go wrong with any of the breakfast sandwiches. Brioche buns, egg and a variety of different spreads and toppings to choose from. Weekends welcome new specials for both breakfast and lunch. Benicio del Porko, a twist on eggs Benedict, is my top weekend special right now. Jalapeño cornbread topped with bbq pulled pork, egg and hollandaise. Finish with a little bbq sauce and toasted corn. \"Once it hits your lips, its soo good!\"    Lunch is just as great, top quality ingredients on their fresh made breads. The Jive Turkey is a hit in my book. I could go on forever about this place and the people that make it happen. If you are in the NW its worth the stop in."}
{"text":"Loved it! Very interesting choices and the portions are generous. Seating can get competitive when it's busy, but I will definitely be back again.   I had the pollo picante breakfast burrito and I'm pretty sure there was an entire chicken stuffed in there. It was just the right amount of spicy and I loved it!  If you're looking for interesting brunch options you need to give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!  The brioche buns are out of this world and they have one of the best Cuban sandwiches I have ate in Vegas!  We have had most of the items in the bakery case and they have all been excellent. You can't go wrong with anything here. Great service also!"}
{"text":"Very unique and different breakfast items! The Wife & I enjoy it on the days we don't have kids for a morning date! Their bakery items are awesome too! Too sweet for me, but the Wife swears by them."}
{"text":"Food was soo yummy!!! Will be back to try those yummy looking cronuts.  The dirty chips were amaze balls. I'm going to be coming in to try the French toast very soon."}
{"text":"100% delightful breakfast experience!! A hidden Southern-style gem in the Vegas desert, this place is precious and the food is on point! I stumbled upon Lulu's one day while I was on this side of town and decided to give it a try... The Skinny Lulu sandwich and chai tea latte I devoured were awesome. Great customer service with a very cozy environment! I'm taking a macaroon, cookie, and chocolate croissant for later... I expect them to be just as delicious! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the good stuff I heard about this place. I give this place 5 stars for customer service. The lady at the register was super friendly and awesome. I ordered the pastrami hash. Way tooooo much celery flavor to it. Even if you pick it out the flavor is already blended in their and they can not cook it without it. I asked. The thing I didn't like about this place is that it didn't seem as if the items were freshly made. It was made in advanced and cooked in the panini grill or their oven. Nothing was freshly made."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here on my off days, great customer service and always friendly not to mention great food and treats! By far my favorite place to get lattes as well!"}
{"text":"Major disappointment. On their web site they are holier than thou about their ingredients declaring: \"We use only real butter, real maple syrup, fresh herbs, hearth baked breads, great olive oil... Nothing artificial or pre-made.\"  But what was that gloppy stuff they gave me to pour on my stuffed French toast? It certainly wasn't real maple syrup as promised. I asked the server to show me where he got it from and he hauled out an industrial-sized plastic container of corn syrup with artificial flavors and colors. This from the place that promises \"real maple syrup\" and \"nothing artificial.\" The kid insisted it was maple syrup until I pointed out the ingredient list to him.  I'd expect fake maple syrup at IHOP but geez, even Cracker Barrel manages to use real maple syrup. The fellow at the table next to us sent his food back because the bacon was barely cooked. It looked raw. It's hard to mess up bacon.  The stuffed French toast wasn't any good, without or without maple syrup. It was just gooey.  The concept of this cafe sounds good but it fails in execution and ingredients that don't live up to the premise of the place."}
{"text":"I was rather put off by this place. My first impression was that it was super small but cute. There were no other customers in the place but when we walked in, someone up at the counter looked at us and then quickly looked away. No greeting, nothing.   There was a holder full of paper menus, so we grabbed one and sat down to look it over. It was small with few options and not at all impressive. My husband said he wasn't interested in eating there. I said I would just grab a coffee and we could be on our way.   I looked to the counter and there was no one there. I had been pleased to find out we had a mom & pop place for coffee in this area that I could support. But there were no coffee items on the paper menu and nothing by the counters stating what kinds of coffee they serve. My husband pointed out the carafe of black coffee to the side. But I had been told Lulu's serves flavored varieties. I would have asked but there was no one to ask.   We finally just left. It would have been nice if someone had been available to answer our questions or to at least act like they cared that we were there.   I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolute gem for the northwest. Unique menu that changes and has add ons regularly. Not to mention fresh baked bread daily. Do your self a favor and visit this Lulu's. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Baked goods are amazing and they do breads you can take with you.  Ive tried their french country and their pretzel buns are great for backyard burger bbq.    My daughter loves their nutela crasant.  I cant give you a favorite, all i have tried is amazing and i always have a hard time choosing!"}
{"text":"I honestly love lulus, such a cute brunch place with great staff and great interior design. The food is always great- the breakfast burrito is my absolute favorite. You have to try. Their croissants are amazing as well. Definitely give it a try, especially on nice day because they have outdoor seating! I usually bring my 2 100 pound dogs with me, it's so close to home and we walk there - and the staff always brings my boys a bowl of water and serves us out on the patio. Also, the manager always greets us so great and makes sure we are all taken care of. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Such a cute little spot that is a 'not so hidden' gem. I got the benecio del porko and it didn't not disappoint. It was a huge portion for me and I would've been totally fine with just half paired with the iced vanilla latte that I also ordered. Lulu's has a small but perfect breakfast/lunch menu. And I couldn't help but indulge in a couple samples of their yummy chocolate chip as well as oatmeal cookies. Came in for breakfast and left with a delightful bag of granola and a grin in my heart."}
{"text":"Food was good but portions were small.  I agree with other reviews that the ordering system makes it a little complicated.  Also they didn't have fresh baked goods throughout the day...guess if you don't come early enough you lose out. Cuban coffee was good. Very slow service as we sat in the area ajoined with Metro Pizza.  Server didn't bring us utensils and we asked a few times.  Food took a long time to get."}
{"text":"The wife and I are very happy we stopped by this morning. When we first walked in I spotted a couple of laptops and worried about this place being too Hip/Starbucky. But like David S., my wife remarked how she felt as if she were no longer in Vegas. Brick walls and exposed rafters add to the atmosphere and avoids being too cute.  Service is friendly and professional. My wife ordered the vegetable frittata, and I had the breakfast tartine. The tartine is not a regular menu item, but hopefully it soon will be. The base was a thick slice of toasted country bread, followed by a slice of ham, gruyere, eggs and finally hollandaise. Rich, decadent and filling. The croissants were absolutely delicious. Light, airy, flaky. The coffee was rich and flavorful, hot, as coffee should be. Iced coffee is available for the laptop crowd.  Everything just seemed perfect. Lulu's is not trying to overreach. A delicious, solid breakfast with delicious bakery items, and coffee. Limited for now, but delicious. Keep it up."}
{"text":"We a new to North Las Vegas and this was our first stop at a non chain restaurant and we were not disappointed in the least! Service was great, food was incredible and fresh! The breakfast burrito was amazing and so big! I was sad that I wasn't able to finish it because it was so yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. We anxiously waited for Lulu's to open those doors, and have not had a bad meal or experience yet. Robin (manager/cashier) always remembers us and our drinks. Any breakfast you order or pastry will bring you back for more. Don't forget to buy some Brioche Buns for those hamburgers at home."}
{"text":"This a totally adorable (very) little breakfast spot, attached to Metro Pizza. The service is fast and friendly. I had the cornbread benedict, called Benecio del Porko. Seriously, so good, but the portion was huuuuge, and I could only eat half (and I have a really hearty appetite first thing in the morning/afternoon). Highly reccomend, but could be a wait depending on the time of day you go."}
{"text":"So excited we have a place like this here now, yes it's far if you aren't in the northwest area.. But that might even be better so its not crowded ;)  They have the best breakfast, pastries, coffee, bread , everything. Everyone that works there is so nice and loves to feed you. Price isn't too bad, support local businesses and try.  love lulu's"}
{"text":"Ok Food.  Certainly not as good as a lot of reviewers claim.  It's a cafeteria style (wait in long line) order from counter, then wait.  The wait was over 30 minutes for our food!!!  I asked if that is typical and they said \"yeah that's pretty normal\".  Awful service.    I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for years now. Every time we come the food is just as good as the last. I love atmosphere and the staff is always super friendly. They seem like a big family there which is nice!  Personally I am infatuated with the Benecio Del Porko. It's a play on an Egg's Benedict. It's absolutely amazing and I've dragged so many friends and family here to try it. Every one of them who has tried it has fallen in love with it and wanted to come back when they are in town. Definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"At first glance this place looks good. We ordered the Benico and the BAT. The Benico has a tangy BBQ sauce and the Pulled pork was brined with the same slightly tangy flavor. I was expecting smokey. The BAT had cherry tomatoes with a balsamic vinegary flavor at the bottom of the bun. I would have preferred to leave them off so I just removed them. The food was ok. I probably would have had a better experience trying the pastries. Over all I gave this place 3 stars because I kept thinking what I would have added or taken away to improve my breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is good!! The workers are really nice but the boss, Robin is very mean so beware! Shes the one that you will have to deal with once you pay!! She's not approachable and i dont think she knows what customer service is. When you talk to her, there is no eye contact, and very short with you. When she gave the drinks, she just slams it on the countertop.  When you ask her something she gets attitude. Over all IF we go back, its only for the food."}
{"text":"This business is adjacent to a pizza parlor, and serves breakfast/brunch items.  You order at the counter and they bring your food out.  They also have a nice patio area.  The food was good, and the servings were generous.  Inside seating is somewhat limited, but it was not super busy when I was there."}
{"text":"This is a cute spot to have either breakfast, lunch or just coffee. I went here with the boyfriend for brunch this past weekend and I'm so happy that North West finally has something like this. We were quickly greeted by the staff and gave us the run down on all their menu items. The smell of fresh bread and pastries just welcomed your tummy to try everything. We had the stuffed French toast which is to die for, the amount of flavors it just made you want to ask for more, we also got the maple sweet potato hash and eggs, which unfortunately does have meat  the menu doesn't state that so being vegetarians we had to pick around it but other then that it was OK.   I will most defiantly come again and try their other menu items and pick up some freshly baked bread."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We've been in for breakfast twice. Each time I've had a variation of the breakfast burrito, and each time its been really good. Most recently it was a pulled pork offering, which was fabulous, but a previous one with sausage and eggs was also quite tasty.  My wife had a dish each time that was basically a variation of a benedict, and it was delicious. Highly recommend that one as well.  Good coffee too.  There are great baked goods to be had here as well.  I highly recommend the chocolate cherry bread (awesome!) and the various sweet pastries."}
{"text":"My wife and I had never been, so, on the recommendation of a couple-worker, we ventured to try something new.  The pastry we selected was flaky, buttery, and delicious. The Benicio del Porko my wife ordered was delicious (the meat was a bit salty but cooked tender, and the hollandaise balanced it). I ordered the turkey, Brie, and cranberry grilled cheese; excellent, if you're a fan of Brie. Lots of Brie. Lots. Next time I order I'll ask for extra cranberries, but that's a personal preference.  The service was +A. I recommend giving this place a try if pancakes and eggs w/hash browns doesn't quite cut it for you."}
{"text":"The breakfast items are on the lighter side. Unlike breakfast restaurant chains, you won't find combo plates of eggs, bacon, and toast. The specialty here is the Egg on a Soft Roll, and there are several variations to choose from off the menu.  Skinny Lulu: Egg whites, red pepper, pesto, grilled asparagus, and Romano cheese. A light, yet tasty roll. All that was missing was spiciness. The hot sauces they have on hand are a few varieties of Tabasco sauce, but I think shaking some onto this roll adulterates it.  S.O.B.: This is what my boyfriend ordered. After one chomp out of this, I almost didn't want to give it back. No regrets about ordering the Skinny Lulu. It was good, but I prefer this one more because of the slight bite it has. There's pepper jack cheese, green chilies, chicken chorizo, and avocado -- the perfect combination of ingredients.  Apart from their breakfast rolls, the do sell other items like french toast, parfaits, pastries, and frittatas. Though I've talked about breakfast, Lulu's also offers a lunchtime menu with an offering of sandwiches and salads.   The food is made to order and delivered to your table. Their dining area is tiny, but you can sit outside when the temperature allows for that. They do share the building that they're in with Metro Pizza, so if the main dining area gets full you can head to Metro's dining space."}
{"text":"My first visit was very good! I was not expecting the restaurant to be a order and sit down place, but the staff made it work. They were so nice and helpful. The food was very good and so much comes with. The plates made me wonder if I would need more food since it is a la carte, but I did not I had plenty of food!   Just try! Very cute and different! I loved it all thanks to the staff!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this cute little nook but was disappointed. We had the French Toast and pastrami hash.. neither I liked, my eggs that came with the hash were way over cooked even though I ordered them \"sunny side up.\" Since I didn't like either of those dishes I decided to order a cinnamon roll since you really can't mess that up, wrong. A cinnamon roll you would expect it to be dough layered with cinnamon and sugar but this was over cooked, dry and flakey that was overwelmed with the goop that comes on top. I'm always willing to give a place a second try but after 3 dishes and didn't like any of it, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and amazing food! I've been here with my toddler son and even with large family. It's a great place and food is super fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Very cool place! I had a coconut caramel latte with one of the tartines, (the bacon and potato one) which is basically a version of eggs Benedict. It was DELICIOUS! I have also had a croissant and a few pastries and those were also very good. I love the ambiance of this place! Brick walls with comfort food and friendly staff. Definitely my new favorite breakfast place. I recommend this place for a coffee/light meal get together in the early afternoon."}
{"text":"This is my kinda place. I wish it were closer to me. I'd probably eat there once a day if it were. I came here with Christina, David and another friend Cameron for a late breakfast/early lunch, but it wasn't brunch (only because it wasn't Sunday and there was no mimosa's). The place is adorable. Kinda cafe-ish, kinda modern barn-ish, kinda electic-ish. A mix of things. Anyway, I liked it.   I ordered the fruit and cheese plate. Excellent. However, IMO they definitely needed honey for the cheese(s). The cheddar wasn't anything special liked I hoped it would be. The goat was good but was cold, would have been so much better room temperature and creamy. The brie was good. The toasted ciabatta bread was delicious, although they only give 1 slice for 3 types of cheeses, and a decent amount of cheese. Note, order at least 1 more piece of bread.    Others had the bbq sandwich, corn chowder, fritatta and an egg sandwich. Everyone enjoyed what they had, that's for sure. We pretty much finished everything single thing on our plates! At the end of the meal, one of the staff walked around with a tray of dessert samples; some sort of brownie with pretzel deliciousness, choc chip cookies and a pistachio cookie too. WOW! So good!"}
{"text":"Yep, this place is just the cutest! It has that upscale mom and pop breakfast place joint feel and for my first time there I think we got lucky on a Saturday around lunch and it wasn't too packed. The food is quick and the iced coffee I ordered was given to me when I ordered so I had that to drink while I waited for my food. Enjoyed my food and coffee and would for sure go back :)"}
{"text":"I like the baked goods from Lulu's, and the service is pretty good. They stumble when it comes to coffee though. I asked for a cafe au lait and got a giant cup of hot milk with no coffee flavor. Get your baked goods or delicious breakfast sandwich to go and make your own coffee."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday around lunch time and was able to get right in despite the fact that the place was small. It was a little hard to find; just look for metro pizza sign. The food absolutely blew me away. We ordered the Benicio Del porko and a green chile pork breakfast burrito. We were not so happy with our breakfast we almost didn't want to switch plates half way through but then we were happy we did.  We also got iced mochas on the side and they were delicious with a strong coffee flavor instead of just tasting like chocolate. I think this place is a little pricey for breakfast but it is absolutely worth the money!"}
{"text":"This place is like a nicer version of cafeteria. You order, pay at the counter, take a seat and they'll bring your food for you. I got a bit confused how their system worked as I saw a bunch of nice big booths when I walked in. Thought this place was full service restaurant (Table service). Later found out it was attached to Metro Pizza owned by the same person. We sat in a big comfortable booth that could easily fit 6 people. (I guess that was Metro Pizza's seating area?? but they said OK.) I had \"New Year's resolution\" which is not on the menu. I asked what's the healthiest, and the girl recommended me this. This menu was created for the people that set New Year's resolution goal to be healthy and lean. (Perfect for me!?) It's spinach tortilla filled with low fat mozzarella, egg white, fresh spinach, roasted tomatoes and lean ground turkey accompanied with salsa verde and guacamole.  The homemade guacamole was delicious. The ground turkey tasted exactly like Italian sausage which was nice and spicy. Although... I should've asked to go light on the cheese. I love cheese and everything but the amount they put was way too much for me. Even though it was low fat cheese, my stomach felt heavy after eating half of it. I think this menu was far from \"lean and healthy\" (just my thought, you know).  Would've been nice if they had more healthier options for people that feel like eating lighter lunches.  I'm not familiar with this neighborhood but this place was only 2 min. drive from Moon Valley Nurseries. It was very convenient for me today, thanks Lulu!!"}
{"text":"If going to this place you need to try the pastrami hash and Carmel iced coffee. Both will leave you feeling like a million bucks.  I wanted to rate this place higher but can't because the Caption America sandwich had more fight than expected. Super hard bread was like biting into a loaf of rocks. Actually cut the top of my mouth! Other than almost bleeding out I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"Vegas has tons of breakfast spots, most of which are just okay with typical menus of pancakes and eggs. Lulu's stands out of the crowd with their delicious fresh baked goodies, unique, easy to read and reasonably priced menu and above all great full flavored food. This little bakery cafe is tucked next to Metro Pizza with friendly staff and great selections. I had the S.O.B. while my partner in crime ate the Lulu's Breakfast Burrito and in between \"Yum\" and \"MMM\" we both agreed these dishes were some of the best breakfast items we have eaten. My S.O.B. was chicken chorizo, green chilis, jack cheese and cotija cheese sandwiched between the softest most delicious bun you can imagine. The bread is what made this dish. PIC had pulled pork, black beans and queso that we could have drank out of a cup all wrapped up in a toasted tortilla. The salsa verde on top was mouthwatering good and we walked away with happy tummy's and smiles. Exactly the way you want to leave a restaurant. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yay! They're FINALLY open! Food options are slowly getting better in our neck of the woods.   Open for Breakfast and Lunch, we opted for a couple of lunch items:  Dirty Fries-Kettle chips coated with Hollandaise, piled high with BBQ pulled pork topped with Cotija Cheese and Cilantro....Very hearty and delicious!  Turkey and Brie with Apples on Raisin-Walnut Bread...if you're a fan of savory/sweet combinations, this is worth trying! Great service here is another plus and I'm most definitely returning to try their breakfast selections.   Their section of daily artisanal breads is also very cool. Grab a loaf on your way out to  enjoy with cheese and wine, or if you plan to make more sandwiches. Note to the Chocolate Loaf...Your A$$ is MINE!!!! I will transform you into French Toast with Caramelized Bananas and Chocolate-Cherry Bread Pudding!!!!    ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best Cuban sandwiches in Vegas. Great service and awesome pastries and bread. I love it."}
{"text":"After our second time here I must say it is one of our favorite places in town. The manager at the front is always a riot as she takes your order \"Baby!\"  Nevertheless the food here is outstanding and highly recommended the Benicio del Porko. Would be 5 stars if they hadn't forgotten about 1/3 of our table's order this last time."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very brash and ungracious woman who I'm presuming is either the owner or manager.  That is not the type of person you would like to start your day with.  We ordered the cream filled croissant which was delicious and the Benicio del Porko which I did not care for.  The cornbread was dry and I thought it would be better on the side than under the eggs.  The barbecued pork was also dry.  The eggs were done medium so the yolks did not run down as seen in some of the photos.  All in all the whole thing was dry and I couldn't eat the cornbread.  I don't think we will be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! A great place for a coffee and a bite or a small lunch or breakfast. Their menu may not be huge but the options they have are delicious. The burrito is my favorite and it is so filling too. Baked goods are delicious as well. Coffee is spot on every time. The employees are all very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot tucked away in the NW. Breakfast sandwiches and pastries in a cute atmosphere. Had the Captain America breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Make sure you have an hour to wait for your food! Although it was super yummy, it wasn't worth the wait. The manager was probably the rudest person I have ever met. Yelled at customers!! Staff walked out of the building crying during breakfast. Yummy food. Horrible service. Awful manager."}
{"text":"This is a cute place with a nice interior and a promising menu. The secret menu adds a whole extra page to the choices.  Service is usually mediocre to fair, depending on the day of the week and if the boss is on shift. Weekends tend to be busier and better than weekdays. My final visit to this place took place on a Thursday lunch in December. The boss wasn't in and there were no other customers. The girl taking the order let me order an ultimate hot chocolate and a fugazi. When I got to the cashier, he told me that it was a weekend only item and that I would have to choose something else. I opted to stick with the sandwich. The forks we were given had crusty food stuck to it. I complained about this and was given a new setting. The dark haired manager on shift began talking to the cashier while behind s corner and made several motions towards our table. The food was delivered to the table by all three of the employees working that day. I took one bite of my sandwich, and the cashier behind the counter started having a big laugh. That was enough to put me off my meal. I did not finish the food or leave a tip. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice.  It's a quaint breakfast/coffee house.  The music is relaxing, but seating is limited unless you count the seats inside metro pizza.  Service is friendly.   The prices are reasonable, but I found the flavor combinations of my food to be bland.  I had the bacon, gruyere, and mushroom frittata.  I did enjoy my pumpkin pie coffee, a seasonal drink.  I would only come back for the variety of coffee house drinks and freshed baked goods."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different and I felt like I made the wrong choice. The woman at the register was the most rude, but not before you were greeted by someone who speaks when walking away from you so you can't hear a word. Then I ordered the only thing that looked good on the breakfast menu, the burrito, which tasted horrible. I think I consumed 2000 calories in one meal with all the nasty nacho like cheese they put all over it..   They charge a fortune for something that is not even full service, and then they expect a tip? When asked if they had any larger soda they said no, all we have are the small ones (no refills).  I was hoping to spend a nice breakfast getting service and not having to get up every time I wanted my water or coffee filled; having a nice breakfast. The breakfast was nasty and the staff act like their shit don't stink.   No Thanks.. I'm going back to the cracked egg next time where there is variety and pleasant staff.."}
{"text":"A quaint and delicious breakfast/lunch cafe for foodies. Delicious breads baked fresh at the store and friendly staff who care about your experience. I love dining there alone and with friends....perfectly suitable for both. It's also great for less adventurous eaters who would like to enjoy a simple slice of pizza because Metro Pizza is attached right to it!!!!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe I didn't know about this place sooner! I always complain about the lack of good quality restaurants in the north side and here comes Lulu's Bread & Breakfast. The Benicio del Porko eggs benedict (an award winning eggs benedict) is PERFECTION! Served over what I can only assume is homemade corn bread as it is the best corn bread I've ever tasted (with real bits of corn) and sweet pulled pork with bbq sauce (I don't normally like pulled pork as I find it too dry.. NOT LULU'S!), it has become one of my favorite foods of 2015 haha and makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  The ambiance is just as great: floor to ceiling windows full of natural light, cute decor, and even better - it's connected to a Metro Pizza!"}
{"text":"Feels like you're walking into someone's home. Amazing food, atmosphere, and cool people."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and food!  Love it and such a cute local place!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Something different than just bacon and eggs. Food was excellent, service was great, and not expensive! I will DEFINATELY be going back often."}
{"text":"I too really wanted to like this place but it fell a little flat.  Ordered the pastrami hash, a couple breakfast sandwiches, and the stuffed French toast.  Also, a couple coffees, lemonade and an apple juice.  The portions for the hash and the French toast were a little less than expected for the price especially and the breakfast sandwiches were just o.k--nothing special.  The hash had traces of pastrami in it but not really a major ingredient.  The bill was 37 bucks which we thought was slightly high given the portion size and pedestrian food quality.  Honestly, the highlight was the super nice lady at the counter.  She's a joy and will make anyone smile but not enough that I'll be back anytime soon.  All in all I'd give it an overall letter grade of B."}
{"text":"This is the kind of brunch place to come to. The smell of fresh bread, friendly staff, and awesome menu. Seriously, put some pants on (even sweats will do) and wander over and wake up via taste buds.   what i ate: - sweet potato and sausage hash: savory sausage paired with cubes of sweet potato, yummmmm. And the egg cook knows what s/he is doing cause my over medium eggs were just that (really really rare)! Came with two slices of bread that blew my mind. I feel sad for all those with a gluten allergy who can't enjoy taking a bite of lulu's bread - burrito (daily special): this was amazing! Everything was so flavorful and it all worked together so well. That salsa verde was out of this world! Definitely get this if it's on the daily special menu - ham + cheese tartine w/asparagus and hollandaise sauce (daily special): the ham was nice and salty, the cheese gooey and melted, the hollandaise.... omg the hollandaise sauce... it was so good it left me speechless. Again another dish I'd love to eat again  Pros: - FOOD!!!! Seriously everything I ate was so tasty. I want to go back to eat everything again! - service at the counter was friendly and helpful. there isn't waiter service but this cute brunch place didn't need it. Walk up to the counter, grab a menu, narrow down which dish you want (toughest choice of the day, hands down), and then grab a cozy booth or sit at any of the open tables - plenty of space! Even of a Saturday morning the place wasn't too crowded. They open up the doors to the adjoining pizza place, so you can venture in to grab a place to sit.  Cons: - too many yummy things on the menu! Seriously I couldn't decide what to order - bright! For those grabbing brunch after a long night of drinking, the crazy NV sun streaming in through the windows may make you want to bust out your sunglasses while sitting indoors - although I didn't have to wait for a table or wait long for the good, I wish there was waiter service  Would I come again? YES! (So glad my friend lives right by)"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches and breakfast burrito are tops. The people have been happy and friendly every time I've gone. The lady with the New Awlins accent who calls everyone baby is obviously badass.  The layout could be more efficient. I've seen a lot of people unsure where to order, even though the Lulu's people try to get their attention. Seating is a little sporadic.  The plastic tops they put on some of their to-go containers melt and need to be replaced with something less melty.  Overall, this place is 5 minutes from my house so I'm pretty dang happy to have it as a new breakfast option. The S.O.B. sandwich kicks butt and I'll probably eat it everyday forever."}
{"text":"The place is hard to find, but literally a hidden treasure. The staff are all friendly and personable. I had dinner with my sister whom spilled her coffee and my nephew and they helped us clean up. I ordered a nice dirty chai and my sister got a black coffee. When we ordered breakfast (the New Years resolution and a Benny) they came out quickly with delicious food. The bbq sauce was a bit too sweet, but it was all beautifully prepared. When I tried the free sample French Loaf, I immediately went and grabbed one to go. I mean it was perfect. Buttery, fluffy,  mmmm mmm mm. I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in town.  Menu is to die for and a bakery to take home other goodies once you are all done eating."}
{"text":"Ahhh-mazing! I've eaten there twice and the cappuccino was perfect (Seriously hard to come by) & my breakfast sandwich was filling.   I will return to buy bread."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about... I was not impressed. Came here today, wasn't busy so I was able to order right away, after looking at the menu I realized there wasn't much for me to eat. When I'm out I eat vegan/ or primarily pescetarian without eating eggs or dairy. Needless to say, they have very limited options for those with dietary restrictions. Coffee was also sub par.   I thought the layout was strange there is another restaurant that was connected, a pizzeria I believe. No idea if it's the same owners, if not, even more weird. I asked if Lulu's served mimosas, they do not. However, the restaurant that was connected to Lulu's has a huge bar. Could I have ordered from that bar and brought it over? No idea, no direction was given. Again, going back to it being a very strange layout.  Another reason for the bad review was because the workers were very unprofessional. Eating in the dining room during shift, or on break. I understand people need to eat, and employees do get breaks. However, I'm almost certain that if the health inspector came in and saw this happening Lulu's would be fined for this and certainly be given a downgrade in code. I work in the service industry, too and this is one of my biggest pet peeves. Eating in front of guests is a no no.   If you are an avid Eater Vegas reader and have seen Lulu's on there as a place to go as I've read also, please think again if you live far, it's not worth the drive. I live downtown, and I don't believe it's worth the drive from there."}
{"text":"Lulu's was a great place for breakfast. It is sometimes hard to find a good meal off the strip in vegas and this place hit the spot not only was the fun yummy but the services was excellent too."}
{"text":"Lulus proves yet again that getting away from the Vegas strip yields reasonably priced gems. Tartine is their version of eggs Benedict , and with several options of ingredients, the best part is the flavors aren't destroyed by an over - smothering of hollandaise sauce. Homey, wood floors, travertine table tops, exposed beam ceilings. Worth the visit and assuredly a new favorite breakfast spot. And blessedly .....no smoking."}
{"text":"As others have said, the place is great, younger staff great, but the older woman in sun glasses is rude. Doesn't have social skills at all. Tossed us our straws and receipt then walked away. It's really funny, but rude as can be. Wont go there again, unless she leaves the place, but idunno if she is the manager or owner. Grumpiness emitting from that women is a turn off and has no place in Lulu's imho."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! It feels so homey and welcoming as soon as you walk in. They have the cutest items and foods for sale. I ordered an egg scramble and potato hash and it was great! Vegetables seasoned perfectly, good size, incredible flavor.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the wait was kind of ridiculous. I believe the owner was ringing people up and I mean...it's kind of sh*tty of me to say, but she spends way too much socializing with each and every single customer, especially if they have kids. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate how sweet she is, but maybe let's not spend 5-10 minutes playing with a customer's baby at the register when there are 15 other people in line waiting to pay. It was kind of annoying. If it were empty, by all means go for it. If there's a line out the door, let's hustle just a tad. Also the parent should have had more sense to keep on moving instead of standing there forever showing off their kid. Let's remember manners in a public place, pal.  The wait time to have our food served took a good 25 minutes as well. Luckily, I had taken relatives from out of town so the wait was good as we got to catch up. However, not convenient if you're hungry or in a hurry.  If they could find a way to mix in the great vibes with a bit of fast service, this place would get 5 stars.  PS: try any of the pastries, even to take to go. They're to die for!"}
{"text":"I will never be back here again. I called to make reservations for a baby shower and they told me they don't take reservations but that I could reserve a table next door at Metro Pizza. That way I could sit over there but I would be able to order food from lulus's. I thought well that's good enough. Over the course of a couple weeks I talked to the manager at metros twice. They were super accommodating and more than willing to do whatever we needed for the baby shower. Fast forward to day of the baby shower. We show up and metro kindly seated us, offered to take our orders and turn them in over at lulu's and bring us our food. Normally you would have to go order yourself at the counter. Super helpful! We set up our table with decorations and presents and a cake and we were getting settled in when a waitress from lulus came over and told us we had to move to a table that was closer to the counter. We gathered up all of our stuff started to move and realize we don't have room where they want to put us. I asked if we could move back to our other table and they said no. Everything was going okay until the owner came out. She was perhaps the most unpleasant person I have ever met. (Not exaggerating) She wanted to know what was going on and what I was talking about because they DO NOT take reservations. I told her I was aware and that her staff had told me to call and make the reservations at metro so I did. She proceeded to tell me that, that doesn't make any sense because they don't take reservations either. As she is chewing me out and we are standing in the middle of the restaurant with table clothes, gifts, balloons and a cake in our hands, everyone is the room is staring at us. I was mortified! Thankfully the mom to be was not there yet and we got settled at the table that was too small before she arrived. After that we ordered our food and they told us they were out of some of the stuff we wanted to order. (It was the owner who took our orders) my friend asked why they have the option to still order it if it wasn't available? The owner got in my friends face about it but once she realized my friend wasn't backing down she settled down. All in all I was just appalled at how they treated us. Here I brought them 10 people for brunch and she acted like we had hurt her by coming in for brunch. If I wouldn't have been so speechless during her rant I would have just left....I should have left. I am not sure how this lady runs a successful business. We have our tips to the metro side because they were so awesome and accommodating. Thank you Metro!"}
{"text":"I'm from Portland, so brunch is a big deal for me. Went to some place on Fremont which was over-priced and the food wasn't that great. Came to Lulu's and absolutely loved everything about it! Friendly service and amazing food at a reasonable price! I feel like I'm back home every time I walk in."}
{"text":"Ok, this is not a breakfast place.  No grill.  Microwave or hot plate everything, eggs, meat, quiche.  It is a glorified deli, no more.  When you are expected to have salad as your breakfast side things may have gone wrong.  I am sure there are plenty of uppercrust who don't know that a proper \"breakfast place\" waits on your table, has a variety of \"breakfast foods and choices\" that are grilled not microwaved or hot plated and counter people who might suspect that baby boomers want service not some weird explanation of their take on breakfast.  If you are traveling through do not stop here for \"breakfast\" they do not serve it.  Plain and simple.  Oh, there is no service, your order at the counter.  That is not service."}
{"text":"All the staff is great except for the older lady that works the front counter. The last three visits we have made here she has been super snappy and condesending. Drink order has been wrong the last two visits as well. I'm not sure what's going on this place used to be amazing."}
{"text":"this is one of our fave brunch place to go. the stuffed french toast is to die for! my daughter adores their french macarons! the people are friendly and makes u feel at home!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito I've ever had, really good coffee, and everyone was super friendly. My Saturday is off to a great start."}
{"text":"This was amazing! Not just your regular eggs and bacon. We enjoyed our family breakfast and I wish I would have been able to purchase some bread to go . . . it looked fabulous! Although it looks a bit higher priced it's because the portions are HUGE! You can share--or split! Just go . . ."}
{"text":"I have been to Lulu's about a dozen times. I have really only enjoy 2 items on their menu. The Skinny Lulu is pretty good as well as the parfait. I believe all of the breakfast items are pre-made.    I wish it was more of a cafe with made to order choices.  Perhaps an omelet with breakfast potatoes (not microwaved) option.   If, you are a vegetarian then forget it! Unless you want to eat pastries. Don't waste you time on the cookies which are super dry.  Their drink selection is nice.  The younger employees have always been very nice and friendly.   If their menu ever expands I would return but until then it's breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Two of us came here for a breakfast tasting with a menu set by Chef Chris Decker.  When we arrived, he asked if we wanted to order or just let him send out what he had planned.  We opted for him just to send things out.  We started with a triple berry yogurt parfait with house-made granola.  We then moved on to five sweets--One of Those, Toaster Strudel, Plum and sweet ricotta turnover,  Peach turnover, and Apple pie croissant.    After the sweets, Chef Decker brought two egg sandwiches--Bat Ship Crazy and Farm House, two French toast selections--blueberry and peach, and apple raisin.  and an order of Benecio del Porko, an eggs Benedict on house made corn bread topped with BBQ pulled pork.  We also had a breakfast burrito.  This isn't your typical eggs and bacon with hash browns kind of restaurant.  Rather, breakfast here can be coffee and a couple of these wonderful pastries for a sweet breakfast or you can go to the savory side and get one of the egg sandwiches or other breakfast items.  Not one of the pastries failed to satisfy!  The One of Those is Chef Decker's take on the cronut.  It's named that because you weren't allowed to use the word cronut so customers would just say One of Those.  Between the layers of flaky pastry are layers of wonderfully tasting cream that makes this a sweet treat for sure!   The plum and sweet ricotta turnover and the apple pie  croissant were two more outstanding sweets.  On to the savories, the Benecio del Porko, grilled cornbread topped with BBQ pulled pork, two eggs over easy, Hollandaise, charred corn kernels, and cilantro is sublime!  There's a reason this has been selected best Benedict almost since opening.  Everything in this Benedict just melds perfectly.   The other standouts were the French toasts.  They taste more like you're eating bread pudding than French toast.  The soft brioche with the fruit and a dollop of whipped cream are heavenly.  The two egg sandwiches were excellent also.  Again, I found all items to have outstanding taste.  During our tasting, Chef Decker took the time to explain his passion for breads and he gave us a huge amount of information on the dishes.    Finding out that Chef Decker came from Upstate New York, a graduate of Maine-Endwell  Central School District did not cause me to downgrade my rating.  Our two schools were in different conferences then!  I'd really recommend Lulu's to take your friends and family from out of town for something totally different.  It is good, very, very good!"}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot! Drove by weeks ago and had to try. Food is fantastic! Unbelievable prices for the quality. The restaurant is adorable and all the kids working here are so nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"It took us a while to find the place. Quite hidden but worth it. I had the Hazelnut iced Latte with 2 Xtra pumps of Hazelnut, very good flavor.  Strawberry and Cheese Danish was really good ( I didn't feel guilty eating it ) crispy, thin yet full of flavor yummy yummy.   In regards to customer service, improvement required.  Regardless of who you are at the establishment, the way you treat your customer should always be your best. If my husband and I are in the area, we might stop by."}
{"text":"Benecio del porko, This dish itself is so amazing that people from out of town are worth of take a trip to vegas just to check it out. If cronut was an amazing sweet combination of mixing two existing foods, benecio del porko is the gourmet version of cronut. Grilled cornbread and bbq pulled pork.  They also have other good dishes and drinks (like Lulu's signature iced coffee) but i wont mention so that the benecio del porko! gets the only highlight!!! Superb and lovely!! Oh and they offer a military discount.  A little support to our troops.  Thank you for your support!"}
{"text":"North West Las Vegas finally has a true bakery.  Not yet up to par with the gems we have in other parts of the city but this is a good start.  The selections are few as far as sweets go but they do have a lot more choices when it comes to sandwiches.    I joined Amanda, Petra, Shawn, Soul, Alida, and Helen for their Grand Opening week.  The bakery is located right next to Metro Pizza on Sky Pointe.  If you're coming from US 95 northbound, you will want to take the 215/Buffalo exit but make a left on Sky Pointe and head west until you see Metro Pizza.  As for the items I ordered, I started with a nutella hot white mocha, wow yummy.  Sugary, I love it but more nutella please.  I also ordered the Captain America sandwich which was good.  It was also the last one standing, it was the last avenger.  Additionally I got a croissant and chocolate croissant, I did not see it at the time but they had a guava croissant.  I need to go back and try it!  I ordered one each of the macarons and the ladies didn't know what was in the purple macaron.  I found that odd.    The staff is nice and helpful.  They even helped clean up a mess created by Soul when the doll he threw across the table and knocked coffee all over Alida.  Overall this would be a 3 star establishment if it was housed anywhere else but since this is the only true bakery in the NW area and a decent one at that, come pay a visit.  They can only improve from here on out, the prices on some items are already high so I hope that doesn't change.  I do wish they had blinds though because the windows face South/East and the sun seeps in greatly towards majority of the seating area.  Offer free wifi and I guarantee people will want to spend time and money there."}
{"text":"Menu is a bit small. I wish they served a fruit plate or just traditional eggs and sausage. But the parfaits are delicious, the breakfast sandwiches are top notch,  and bakery items are fresh. The chips are AMAZING! The staff is friendly and helpful. Wide variety of soda beverages to choose from, as well as fresh juices and coffees. Why not 5 stars? I just think they could do more if they offered more."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot!  We came late on a Saturday Morning, it wasnt busy at all. The set up is different where in you order your food at counter then pick your own seats. All the staff was really friendly and gave great details about menu items! I had the pastrami omelette, which was lacking in meat but not flavor. It was full of fresh veggies and well seasoned. The bread that it was served with was fresh and toasted perfectly served with berry jam. The french toast was packed with fruit and more like bread pudding, but tasted homemade and great. Our coffee drinks were nice and hot and flavored perfect. We ordered some type of lemonade mojito (non-alcholic) that was very sour.  The best item I had was a pastry that was like a doughnut stuffed with creamy decadent custard_-- ohemgee! A must try! We ate outside on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful weather! Will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"The raspberry white mocha latte wasn't the worst.The only reason I didn't really like it much is because I don't really drink coffee.But on the other hand the macaroons and water were great so I'm rating 4 stars"}
{"text":"I've been going to Lulu's for years. It's hidden in the corner of Metro Pizza and is an absolute treasure.   The food here is decadent, the service is outstanding. I dare you to not be called \"baby\" or \"hunny\" by the owner. She genuinely cares!! Their scratch made deserts are the best too!  I get the ham and gruyere tartine when I go. It's served on scratch made bread, over medium eggs, ham, gruyere cheese topped with their famous hollandaise sauce!!! #winners!!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little gem  good coffee, good pastries, and good and the benecio feel porko are so good! Let them know if you are sharing it bec they will split it for you"}
{"text":"Lulu's Bread & Breakfast - Las Vegas, NV (Centennial Area)  I know I'm late to the party.  Lulu's has been around a few years and it's taken me this long to finally give them a shot. Lulu's specializes in baked goods, but it's the Benicio Del Porko that reminds me how lucky I am to have taste buds. This monster is two eggs, on top of BBQ pulled pork, and a grilled piece of cornbread. Hollandaise sauce and corn is then added.  I was sold on just the two eggs part.  The rest was just icing on the cake.  My only complaint was to myself because I didn't get the Benicio Del Porko.  I sampled Terri R's. I had the Captain America, which is an egg sandwich with sausage, ham, and cheese.  And because I love eggs, I had two eggs added.  Take that, Captain America!!  My breakfast sandwich was great and I recommend it.  But really? Who am I kidding?  It's all about the Benicio Del Porko."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place to grab breakfast/brunch and lattes. The owner (I assume she's the owner, she's definitely in charge) has always been super friendly when I've eaten here and is always willing to answer questions about some of the menu items. They definitely have a different take on some dishes but that's part of what makes it so delicious and unique. She recommended the Benecio del Porko which, not going to lie, I thought would be disgusting. It was SO good. I recommend it to everyone I know when we eat here. That and the Nutella latte are my favorite. Good food, good service, cool little atmosphere. Maybe not the best for kids and definitely not for picky, boring eaters but if you're looking to try something new, eat here."}
{"text":"The yelp app told me this was a hot new business, so I had to go check it out.  Not too often am I available to get out for breakfast so this was a treat.  My husband and I had the Captain America sandwich and it was delicious.  The bread on this thing was the real treat.  Buttered top and flaky as all get.  (all over me)  He had a nutella croissant and I had a delightful guava one.  Love that they have retro style soda and even Mexican Coke made with real sugar.  Every staff member was an absolute gem.  We were offered a piece of buttered bread of the day and cookie samples while we figured out what we wanted to eat.  When I ordered coffee, the cream was brought out fresh for me.  No sweet and low, but they do have sugar in the raw.  Even the gal who cleaned up after our bread explosion was friendly.  I can't wait to come back and try some other things.  Metro pizza is in the same building with a sliding door between the establishments.  So pizza then cookies is a major convenience."}
{"text":"Breakfast isn't just a morning meal!  Located along Sky Pointe and N Cimarron rd, Lulu's is one those Blink and you'll miss it kinda places. I think even Google/Apple maps has it across the street in the gas station. But Don't be fooled, it's in the same brick building as a Metro Pizza.  When walking in I noticed quite a few cool things 1) Rocking a yelp logo on the window. 2) It looks new, I mean it's been open over a year and a half and it still looks like it just opened. And 3) The layout is great with outdoor seating, hightop table seating with plugs for laptops etc and half booth style seating.  The menu has a great variety of items to choose from bakery, desert, coffee and speciality breakfast dishes that are made fresh to go or stay. They also do rock quite a few Australian Bundaberg soda products which I believe always deserves extra stars.   If your in a group and your not feeling breakfast or brunch, just head through the connecting doorway and grab some Metro Pizza or some Gelato as an alternative.  They have a good supply of high chairs, so you parents don't have to lock them up or find a sitter. The staff are pleasant and very interactive if you have any questions.  Overall Food: 4.5 - 5 Drink: 4-5 Service: 5-5 Coming back: Yes"}
{"text":"This place is great :) food and coffee are well done.  If you are looking for a cool breakfast place this is a good spot. Very cute and well kept."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I've even had! The Captain America was amazing. Cute breakfast/lunch place. Pastries looked amazing-wish I had room to try one!"}
{"text":"On our trip to Vegas we ended up staying at an Airbnb down the street from this place. I'm from the bay area and it made me feel right at home the food was incredible if you get a chance please eat the cinnamon roll.  Our service was amazing, we went there for breakfast on my birthday and they even gave me a free cookie"}
{"text":"Wan fresh bread,lemonade,breakfast food or baked good made with real ingredients? I suggest checking this place out. If I could I would live here. One of the best locations  to eat. It is no cheap but you should expect wonderful food and service to be cheap. Overall I would give them an A. Service fantastic and food even better. Try it would if you like food."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time for breakfast. Nice decor,but the food was just adequate . My friend had the goat cheese and sundried tomato frittata it was soft and tuff in different places, maybe made the day before and microwaved to order. I had the sweet potato hash. It was good but it seemed like it was sitting in a warming pan. The over easy eggs were about hard inside and it looked as though it was fried in some sort of form or mold. We did not try the pastries, but with 30 years as a baker, they all looked under cooked. Maybe in time they will get the kinks out. I'll give them another try.."}
{"text":"Decent food, but limited. To-go orders take forever! The main reason I am writing this is because the lady who appears to be in charge is almost always rude and demeaning toward her staff, but last time I went in she was rude and demeaning/scolded me.  I took the scold in order to defer her from yelling at her employee.  It was just a simple misunderstanding that she blew WAY out of proportion.   I am from a family who has owned restaurants for longer than I have been alive. (32 years)The customer is always right. I have worked in the service business for at least ten years and am now in education.  I have been in fine dinning and worked at a diner and everything in between.  And the way she treats others is wrong.  I used to share to my friends/coworker/family about this place bc they do have one great dish but I won't bother to tell I what it is because I'd hate to subject u to her rudeness/blame game playing.  I told my coworkers about my experience as they could see that I was upset(one was with me when it happened)  and couldn't eat anyway due to the anxiety she had cause me for a simple misunderstanding that nor I or the person who took the order was at fault or even mad/upset about. She is not good at customer service and should not be dealing with people.  She treats them like dogs."}
{"text":"Wow what a gem!  This place is out there a ways but well worth the drive.  It's cozy with easy Parking, incredible food, and great service.  Their coffee is super good and they have great breakfast sandwiches.  Yummy croissants as well!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place everyone is nice and friendly .    The environment is very clean and homie.   Robin is the best. Makes me feel like a close friend of hers everytime I walk in the doors.   Everything is good and unique, something you won't find anywhere else on this side of vegas.   Try the match green tea! They make it the best!  Farm house, breakfast burritos, everything is amazing!  Don't let the 1 star and 2 star reviews fool you, they probably just have shitty taste.."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok. Was hoping for something different I guess. Wasn't good enough to bring me back. The prices were a little high for the product."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant adjoined to a Metro Pizza. Casual,  seat yourself kind of place.  Place your order at the counter, and they'll bring your food to you. Daily specials and free refill self serve drip coffee. They specialize in breakfast, per the name.  I had the Cuban sandwich, substituting shredded chicken for pork, since they were out of the pork. Not bad, but the flavor kind of reminded me of canned sardines in tomato sauce, which I like, so no biggie. The accompanying salad had too much salad tossed in already, so I didn't eat much of that. Next time I'll order dressing on the side.  My friend had the Benicio del Porko, poached egg and pulled pork on cornbread topped with hollandaise and bbq sauce. He said it was rich, but good.  It's not somewhere I'd come eat at every day,  but the food wasn't bad so I'll be back once in a while."}
{"text":"I liked this place. It is small and has a limited menu. Service is good. I had the apple cinnamon french toast. Which does taste like a bread pudding and it was very good. Seating in not very comfortable and you do have to place your order at the counter and get your own coffee. I will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious I just had the Tartine earlier today and it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Then on weekends make sure you go early to get One of Those (Cronut) before they run out it's really great for the price"}
{"text":"Why does this wonderful place have to be so far away from me? I'm going to hunt for some excuses to be in that neighborhood so I can go back. This place has it all for me--unique menu items, amazing customer service, and great atmosphere.   I went on a weekend morning and really fretted over their menu over what to get because it all looked so good. I ordered the Goomba and my boyfriend ordered their pork breakfast burrito. From the moment we walked in, everyone was incredibly helpful and sweet. The lady cashing us out even told us about how the family that was walking in at that moment had been going there since their oldest was a toddler. I like knowing that a fast casual place like that recognizes their regulars and harbor a fondness towards them.   The goomba was a nice little breakfast sandwich on a brioche bun. It had an onion jam on it that was just right. I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito as it had really creamy cheese, the sauce was fresh and it had a nice kick to it. We also had iced pumpkin spice lattes that were delicious and sweet. I can't wait to come back to try out some of their other menu items.   Extra nice touches--samples of their bread and pastries to help you decide what to eat, locally brewed coffee, and pug ins on the the tables so that you can chill there with your laptop."}
{"text":"We were looking for new and different places to eat for brunch and I happened to find this one. The pictures of the food were really neat, so we decided to try it out. When we got in, we were a little confused as to how their operation worked. I don't like to use that phrase, \"how does it work?\" Because many people who say that, are just too clueless as to know how a quick service/self service restaurant cafe works. We were confused because there were booths next door, like a full service restaurant. Then, we realized that the Metro Pizza was connected over.   There was only one table of 3-4 people inside this cafe. We went in about 1:30pm. The decor was cute and quaint. Almost like you have stepped back into a much simpler time.   There was an elder tall woman, with glasses that seemed like she was either the owner, or possibly Lulu herself. At first, she seemed pretty rude and mean with her remarks and demeanor tone. She took our order and seemed annoyed.   It wasn't busy(just 2 tables), so the food was out within a good enough time frame. Around 2pm, the lady sat down and took a break. After she was done eating, I noticed that she yelled at her employee about something. The employee looked scared. I think she needs to retrain on speaking to her employees and her guests in a more professional and respectful demeanor."}
{"text":"One of mine and my daughter Zoeys favorite places for lunch! They have a great selection of healthy food. I love their Strawberry Kale Salad and Zoey enjoys their Grilled Cheese. Clean environment and aesthetically pleasing decor."}
{"text":"The popular Benecio del porko is excellent! Also ordered their blueberry mint mojito lemonade. Love it cause you could really taste it's real lemonade!! The only downfall is they rim the cup with raw sugar. It looks pretty but when I got my drink it was sticky.  Ambiance of the place is amazing. We wanted to take pictures of everything haha There was a guy with blonde hair that we ordered from, he's cool. Very informative & super nice.  One comment of improvement the place needs is the old lady. We have a theory she's Lulu, but anyway.... she was pretty rude up until we tipped then that was when she got nice & says \"thank you baby\". Mind you, if she was nicer in the beginning I would've tipped more. Lol"}
{"text":"It was good, they just don't have much variety. The food is pre-made, we got it 5 minutes after it was ordered."}
{"text":"First time here with my husband and overall the food was good. A couple little things that made my rating only 2 stars worthy. When we first walked in, we didn't know that you go up to the counter or seat yourself , there wasn't any signage anywhere to direct us. The food it's self was good, but nothing to brag about. Another thing that I personally didn't like was waiting for 35 mins to get my food."}
{"text":"I give this place a 1-star rating for the owner's attitude. I've been here many times, and she's always the same. This last time I went she was outwardly rude to one of her employees and humiliated her in front of customers. I had asked for nondairy milk when I ordered my coffee, so the owner retrieved the soy milk and placed it on the counter where the cream and sugar was. While I was paying, an employee came out of the kitchen and, thinking that she was being proactive, started to take the soy milk back to the refrigerator. The owner blasted her in front of everyone. \"Why do you think I put that out there?! A customer ASKED for it! Use your brain!\" Then she proceeded to mumble under her breath, presumably about the employee's inability to read her mind. I was embarrassed for the employee, who was only trying to help. There is NO EXCUSE for a supervisor to ever publicly humiliate an employee. While the food was okay, I will not be returning to this place, and I hope that particular employee finds a place where she is treated with more respect."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Super comfortable vibe and friendly staff. I had the breakfast burrito and my mom had the captain America. Both were amazing. The coffee was on point as well. I enjoyed it all. I will definitely be returning back for sure!"}
{"text":"Voted \"Best of Vegas\" 9 years in a row. With fun menu items like \"Wait..what happened last night\" that feature: flamin hot Cheetos dust, over two over easy eggs, on a bacon topped baked /smashed potato, I can see how they won the title. This ingenious menu item with it's fun use of flamin hot Cheetos is the perfect hangover cure!   Their Benicio del porko was voted best Benedict in Las Vegas by Las Vegas weekly. For $9.95  it features grilled cornbread, topped with bbq pulled pork, hollandaise, charred corn, cilantro and two over easy eggs.   The menu is inventive and fun. The place has a rustic and inviting French chic feel. Lots of large open windows allowing in natural light."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Vegas for Super Bowl and we tried not to eat at the casinos this time. We woke up and checked yelp for a breakfast spot near the disc golf course I was gonna play at and we found this place. The food tastes as good as it looked and smelled. We will come here to have breakfast every time we visit Las Vegas. The Benicio Del Porko was fantastic!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Fantastic service!  Everyone there was extremely nice.  We were able to visit after my sons basketball game and I'm glad we did!  If this location was closer to where we live, we would be there all the time.  My son had the Benicio del porko which everyone tried and loved, my wife says she'll be getting that next time, I had stuffed french toast (small portion) and yogurt parfait with homemade granola.  The blueberries were amazing!  The best I have ever tasted!  Four stars because everything was fantastic, the only reason it wasn't five stars is due to the prices (somewhat expected for the quality) and for the smaller portions on some of the entrees.  If were in the area for breakfast, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place, and take all our friends and family from out of town here for breakfast. I haven't had one thing I didn't like! Great for kids too..."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the neighborhood and hungry.  Read the reviews and decided to stop.  Hubby had pastrami hash and eggs.  No bread though by his choice.  It was good but an acquired taste. Too much celery for his taste and needed jalapeño for him.  I had the green chili pork burrito.  It was good too.  Hubby had water while I had large latte which was good.  Place was super clean, bright and cheerful.  I can see when it's crowded that I may not like the vibe because of the set up.  Lilly's opens to Metro Pizza next door so understanding that you have to order at back of Lulu's is a little confusing. If the line is long, it would snake through the area where you sit for eating.  I don't prefer an atmosphere like this.  There are places to sit outside too.  Glad we hit at off peak. No dessert sampling but if entrees are an example, I'm sure they are tasty. We will be back."}
{"text":"There is a tall guy with blonde hair total diva and super rude and should not be working here everyone else is ver nice and the lady with the blue hair is working her ass off, need to be more organized"}
{"text":"Love this place! Must try the French toast, its delightful!"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this place more than 1 star if it wasn't for that old lady that unfortunately works there.     From the moment we walked in, not a \"hello\", no direction whether you get seated or place your order at the counter, nothing. So we proceeded to go up to the counter, looked at the menu, then the old hag asked, \"did you you get a number?\" Then I answered, \"...uhh..no...?\" \"Ok well you're supposed to get a number but whatever I can help you.\"  Then after ordering our food, she gave me my total, I hand out my debit card to her, she takes it, and threw the card onto the counter when my hand was clearly out to receive MY fucking card back, the card that has MY money that I regret giving to that place.    We then proceed to seat ourselves in the dirty tables still with crumbs from the last person that was there, and she comes over with our food, doesn't even say anything, and yells to her employees, \"you guys need to get more silverware over here,\" comes back and practically drops off the silverware, and then leaves. Not a single \"sorry about that guys, let me get some silverware for you,\" or \"here you go,\" not a damn thing. Just dropped our shit off like if we were animals.    I am not one to complain as lengthy as this review, I've been to plenty of restaurants, and I myself work in customer service for many years now, but this place sucked, and it's because of that lady that I will never come back. Food was good, coffee was good, but the management there was terrible. She was even yelling and pointing fingers at her employees the whole time as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the backside of Metro Pizza which is probably why most locals don't know it exists.  The same family owns both businesses.  I was greeted by a friendly, helpful, blue haired girl this morning who gave me the run down on their menu.  She also said it gets very busy on a Sunday after church so I'll be sure to show up during the week to avoid the crowd.  I ordered the Frittata breakfast and it was a little bland but the presentation and taste of the salad was great and the two thick slabs of grilled, buttery bread were heavenly.  I also tried the Cinnamon bun which was buttery and delicious but they are too heavy handed with the icing and at $5.00 it's a bit pricey.  Afterwards, I learned that you can order the bun without icing."}
{"text":"The pastries and coffee were delicious! The yogurt parfait was also really good. My husband ordered the breakfast plate with pastrami; the pastrami looked like its been sitting in the fridge for days."}
{"text":"Their cornbread with pulled pork was the best thing ever!! I can't wait to go back have it again!! Also their nutella crossiant is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is a real hidden gem! A fabulous breakfast spot, I haven't had anything here that wasn't 5 star. The location is a little tough to find if you aren't familiar with the area, but worth finding.  They have two different menus, one is their regular items, I have had numerous items from this menu... all fabulous! The other is the \"I'm in the know\" menu, it changes seasonally.  Right now, on the \"I'm in the know\" menu, they have a breakfast sandwich called: Kanye West for President? It is 10.95, and it is two over easy eggs, ham, bacon, thick cut tomato, avocado, bbq sauce & a grilled cheese in the middle, yes, you read correctly, a grilled cheese in the middle...on a soft roll. Just typing this makes my mouth water....... They also have the BEST croissants ever!!!!! They made me a ham, gruyere and soft egg on a croissant. OMG, no words!!! We ALWAYS take home a cinnamon roll, we are too full from breakfast to eat it there....."}
{"text":"Can't say much about their food, but their signature latte is AMAZING. Like I had it yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. Almond croissant was delicious! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and baked goods in a cute atmosphere.  I wish I lived closer because I would be here everyday!"}
{"text":"Been here twice since opening, wife got the apple stuffed french toast which is ridiculous good. First try I got the sweet potato hash, which I can't say I was the biggest fan of, but had a breakfast burrito special last time which was by far the best breakfast burrito I have ever had, it really needs to be on the full time menu. Another in our group got one of the fritatas and enjoyed it. I would also recommend getting a loaf of bread to go, have tried the sesame and country french, both excellent and well priced."}
{"text":"Oops forgot to post!!  Love the beautiful pastries and the extremely creative breakfast menu items!   Today we had the Kanye West for President--- it had everything- two eggs, avocado, the thick slice of tomato, bacon, ham and a grilled cheese?!? I guess they named it that because it was FULL of IT.!!! Full of every breakfast item!   Despite the name it was delicious!  The hubby and I split that and one of our favorite items Cinnamon Roll- They will heat it up and it is heaven!!"}
{"text":"The Centennial Hills neighborhood has been missing a good breakfast spot. Lulu's definitely fills that void. They had something for the toddler, teenager and both adults.   The family ordered the fruit yogurt parfait, kids pb&j, cinnamon roll, and the bacon cheddar fritata.  There food came out quick.  I ordered the veggie fritata which was going to take 15 min because it was in the oven. The chef came out twice to let me know and ask if they could get me anything while I waited. I have no problem waiting on a busy Sunday morning for fresh food made from scratch. 15 min later I was devouring the fritata and they also provided me a refund for waiting. It was completely unnecessary, but showed they were very much aware of their customers. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast and brunch in town hands down. Everything on the menu is great but don't for get to pickup fresh bread before leaving. Pretzel buns for burgers, just throwing that out there."}
{"text":"Great place the only reason I give it a 4 star is because they no longer serve the best breakfast sandwich ever the SOB!! Please bring it back..."}
{"text":"We make this wonderful eatery a must visit anytime we have family from out of town visiting us. There has never been anything on the menu which we haven't been amazed with. The good made here is top quality, the freshness is always perfect and the staff is great.  The outdoor seating area makes for a perfect breakfast or lunch with family and friends. You would do well by putting this eatery into your list of top spots."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, friendly staff and the food is awesome. Best breakfast I have had in a long time. Benicio Del Porko is amazing. Tender pork, perfect eggs covered w/ hollandaise. Yum! Skinny Lulu is also super delicious. Will have to come back with the family. Can't wait to try rest of the menu."}
{"text":"On entering we were warmly greeted by an employee as we approached the counter.  There were baked goods on display, but none of them looked very interesting.  The interior is very bright with sun streaming through large windows so we ended up sitting in the adjoining and commonly owned Metro Pizza to avoid the glare.  My wife's stuffed French toast was just okay, but nothing to write home about, though I am mentioning it now.  I chose benecio del porko (grilled cornbread topped with a generous portion of BBQ pulled pork, Hollandaise sauce, easy over eggs, charred corn, cotija cheese and cilantro) that you should only order if you are or want to be a porko.  Mine dish was different, but nothing I would ever order again."}
{"text":"Food is good, it's a cute little place. We've gone a couple of times now and have enjoyed our meals. But the service is SOOO SLOW. Painfully slow. Excruciating. I'm talking 25+ minutes for an egg sandwich and tartine with only one other party of three in front of us. Make sure you go before you're actually hungry because you will wait for your food for a longgg time."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when you've been going there for years!  Lulu's has to be one of the best hidden gems for breakfast/brunch in Vegas! Not only is the food hearty and flavorful with fresh ingredients, but there's inside and outside seating and the ambiance gives you vibes of the breakfast/coffee shops you see in movies! The staff is always so warm and welcoming, always willing to answer questions and make sure you're doing alright without being bothersome.  Love Lulu's for just a quick coffee and snack before work, taking my family to breakfast on the weekend, or even just a place to grab brunch on a day off and relax."}
{"text":"Very good spot for breakfast/lunch. Signature coffee was the best! The stuffed French toast and the hash were very good. Macaroons to go!"}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw this place on yelp so we decided to stop by. It's Kinda hidden but connected to Metro Pizza. First impression upon walking in was that it was a super cute quaint little place. Staff was very friendly and willing to go out of their way to assist you in your decision making process because boy was it needed. They had so many things to choose from. From pastries to fresh baked breads and coffee. The lady at the register made us feel like family. So sweet and helpful. We tried The Herman and The Bernie Sandwich. Both were to die for. They had a large selection of different coffees. I will be going back to try more things soon. I would highly recommend this spot for some great food and coffee."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Fresh baked goodies everyday!  Menu concept reminds me of Hash House A go-go but healthier!  Also, you pay cashier and pick up your drinks, then find a table.  Kind of weird service set up.  But food is worth the wait!  Can't wait to go back for lunch salads, i'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review in the summer but I felt it was necessary to share the love again.  So we took some family from CA over to Lulu's for brunch yesterday. it was pretty busy, so it took a little longer than usual to get our food. No big deal it was worth the wait.  A couple of our orders weren't right, but they were quickly corrected.  The food was amazing and despite the mistakes, the customer service was also amazing. The manager even sent us hoe with a box full of their delicious pastries for our troubles. She really didn't have to do that...at all!  We weren't upset and we were certainly going to continue to visit Lulu's as often as we could.  It was very special of her to do that.  Anyway, bottom line...customer service is real!!  Food in phenomenal.  Try the croissants (any flavor), the french toast, the turkey sandwich, the turkey burger, the \"basket full of green\"... oh heck, just try anything on the menu (and the secret menu) ...they will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love Lulu's! My go-to order is the amazing breakfast burrito. It's flavorful, filling, and has a great kick to it!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here, the staff is so attentative to everyone's needs and the food is amazing. A definite must for Vegas locals!"}
{"text":"Walking in this well lit, beautiful, b&b themed little place the flowers on the table, the smiles on the staff instant good mood. It only helps their cause that they're all extremely friendly and the food is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots"}
{"text":"My wife and I were both really excited to try this place out. I don't know what was going on with today but the employees were arguing with each other behind the counter, very unprofessional. After waiting more than 40 minutes for our food, we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Came in on 6/16/2018. It is a very nice place and we frequently go to Metro Pizza so we thought this morning we would give it a try. It was very busy and at first - I was very excited, especially after seeing all the food that was being plated up. The young woman at the counter who took our order was extremely nice and helpful and explained the dishes thoroughly, the  other gal who checked us out was also very nice I believe she could have been an owner or manager not sure. I did order my food to go and because I only ordered an actual dish and two sandwiches I didn't think I was gonna have to wait almost an hour to get my food. Two individuals that had ordered before I did ended up walking out I know they went up to the register I'm not sure if they received their money back or not. The young woman that had taken my order did come up to me at some point and apologized  over and over again she was very nice. Towards the end of my wait, the woman at the register  who I think may have been a manager or owner got into a small tiff with one of the female employees who had been preparing our food and sent her home. (MARIA) The woman who is being sent home was being a bit loud and I thought this was super unprofessional I went in there to get great food and have great service not to listen to people arguing about orders and food going out. I wish I would've just asked for my money back and been on my way- it's too bad too because the food was very good and we live not too far from there- plus I believe they offer a military discount which is always a good thing seeing how my entire family serves.... to bad LuLu's did not meet our expectations-- I think that the owner or manager of this establishment should re-train their staff to communicate better with their patrons. We can add this to the List of establishments we will not be returning to"}
{"text":"Ate you north side Vegas and looking for best breakfast ever? Come here and get the pulled pork bennie \"bennicio\"."}
{"text":"Not a huge brunch kinda person until I found this place, Shazam  I finally understand this not breakfast not lunch meal of the day. The wife and I love to sleep in on Saturday and head to lulu's around 11.  This place is comfortable, trendy, and inviting. It's kinda hidden,  no big sign , not easy to spot when driving , but that might be one of the best parts. It open from 7 to 3 and on the weekends it has a steady stream of customers( sometimes you might wait 10 or so minutes to get your food , totally worth every minute).   Some days the owner or at least I think the owner who I would assume is lulu is here and let me say she is an added treasure to the visit. She has a kind grandmother with a mix of soup nazi (  Seinfeld reference ). Sounds weird but totally true...   The food it's great , I normally get the Benecio Del Porko, it's amazing. Reading the description you might think \" wtf\" but it works the pulled pork on corn bread with over easy eggs covered in hollandaise sause. It is an amazing mix of flavors!  I have also had the \"Sloppy José \", it's a smaller meal than the Del Porko but it is amazing. It's soft roll with pulled chicken and egg in a mix of green chilies, avocado , and pepper jack. It has an spectrum of amazing flavors that make you want to get another..  So all in all this place is legit, an amazing local spot with unreal food !"}
{"text":"LuLu's is a wonderful french style cafe with many breakfast and lunch options to chose from. They have yummy bread and pastries but what I went for was the Benecio Del Porko. This is pulled pork on two pieces of golden corn bread, topped with eggs and hollandaise sauce. This dish was delicious and super filling! The coffee there is also great and the staff kept the pour your own station stocked."}
{"text":"So we had to train today with the boys...so we decided to try a new place to eat that was healthy and here we are..first off it's dog friendly which was awesome because we had a dog with us this morning for training.   We sat on the patio which was nice and breezy and cool as well as covered. It's kind of in a wind tunnel so it was perfect. The downfall however was our napkins were blowing... powdered sugar on the plates were blowing off on the kids lol..  The food was good but took awhile to come out. It was 5 families and they would bring out our meals in the order that we orderd which was fine..problem was ..when a meal comes out..the family previously would practically be done with their meal...so u couldn't really eat together.  All in all It was good and they were friendly.  The reason for the 3 stars was because of the food coming out late and they took a long long while to pick up dirty dishes...but those are fixable things."}
{"text":"This place is oddly organized and would not do well with a bunch of customers coming in at once.  The food is decent and different from the normal sandwich and breakfast you would typically find.  I'm giving this place four stars because of Christin who clearly does most of the work and is a significant factor in holding this business together."}
{"text":"They people are very nice! The food is amazing! We come here for breakfast all the time. You can never go wrong ordering anything of the menu."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. Maybe too friendly. I don't really like being called honey, sweetie or baby but I knew she meant well. My salted caramel latte was awesome. The cinnamon roll was a bit over the top. I couldn't finish all of it, too much cream cheese. It was delicious but way too much frosting. Maybe it's just me, but the location was confusing. The entrance is off the street not on the parking lot side. Bad building design. I'll definitely give this place another shot but won't order the cinnamon roll and I'll know how to enter the building."}
{"text":"This place is heavenly. I love their croissants, cheese danish, and cinnamon rolls. I did not even notice this place until recently and it's near my son's school. We'll be coming here often from now on. Thank you Lulu's, my search is over for some freshly baked goodies."}
{"text":"Hard to find, but well worth looking for! It's on the side of metro pizza. The captain america sandwich was really tasty n full of flavor. I recommend the butterscotch latte, delicious!"}
{"text":"Ice salted Caramel white mocha was okay, just too sweet to my tastings. This is my second time here, I was hoping they had macarons but unfortunately they didnt, the women at the counter said they hadn't orders any, so unfortunately those weren't freshly made there. If you get a chance, try the salted Caramel macaron, whenever they have them in stock"}
{"text":"Across town for us but I was in the neighborhood and decided to check it out! It was fantastic! What a great breakfast spot! The staff was truly warm and so gracious and welcoming. We said it was our first time and we got wonderful detailed recommendations and they were so yummy!! I had The Goombah breakfast sandwich and it was so perfect! Great flavor and the bread was so soft and yummy! We will definitely return!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Crazy long wait on Saturday the 7th the Revel half and full marathon brought a lot of patrons here for their recovery meal and after waiting 10 minutes to order were told it'll be an hour before we received our food.  I was so looking forward to the Kayne West for president sandwich ( egg, avocado and bacon sandwich with a grilled cheese sandwich in between)  but was unable to get it.  I ended up getting the Cuban sandwich with potato chip fries.    Staff was friendly and kind; only drawback was a child in our group ordered eggs sunny side up (runny)  to dip her toast in and the eggs came out overcooked.   Still worth the drive and the wait for delicious food!"}
{"text":"It's a ways out there, but after going to Gilcrease farms, this was a pretty great breakfast place after we went string bean pickin'. I'm not a meat eater but the man said the Cuban sandwich was amazing, I had quite a bit of veggies along with fresh orange juice. I love spots like this, great service too!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place....especially from the good reviews and because we drove from Henderson just to go and eat here (about 45 minute drive).  We went for brunch on a Sunday and it did not seem too busy.  There were plenty of tables available and there was a small line to order.  They take your order at one counter and then you wait in line to pay for your order at another counter. We ordered and then stood in line for about 15 minutes before we could even pay for the order.  The set up is just not expeditious in any way.  We got a table and waited for our food.  There were four of us; 2 people in our party received their order in about 35 minutes....the other 2 received their order in about 50 minutes.....which was over an hour from when we first made our order.  We ordered a Benedict and a 3 Sandwiches (total).....so over an hour seems completely unacceptable to me for such a small and simple order.  The Pulled Pork Benedict was good and the pork was nicely flavored but their Cuban Sandwich was flavorless.  I was so hoping that it would be good enough for the hour plus wait....but I was really disappointed.  We also ordered a side of potatoes...but it was a small plate of about 10 thin, small slices.  The portion was really small for a paid side order and they were also MEH.....nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all.  To be honest, I would not make the trip across town again with so many better options."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews, my husband and I were so excited to try this place.  Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience.  The place is very cute and has great potential.  But it was so disorganized and frankly, our food was terrible! It's very confusing when you walk in - are you supposed to sit down? go to the counter? where are the menus? Once we figured that out, the girl behind the counter asked if she could take my order.  I started to tell her and she turned and started talking to someone else.    Even though there were only 4 people in front of us, it took 15 full minutes from the time we ordered to the time we paid - their system is flawed.  When I asked for water, it was like I had ordered the most complicated drink ever.  Then of course the water thing was empty.  Waited another 25 minutes for our food which of course came with no silverware.  And then, after all that, the food was not that good!  My husband ordered an egg sandwich and he said fast food restaurants have better ones.  I had the frittata which came with salad and grilled bread.  The salad was soaked in dressing and inedible.  The frittata had no flavor.  I did get a chocolate croissant and that was yummy so I'll give them that.  Otherwise a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Every other breakfast place around was packed so my boyfriend and I decided to give this a shot. Nice hipster look but confusing ordering process. You have to order at the counter and pay for your food before you sit. U sit and wait for your server to bring you the food but you are able to get your own coffee but cant get your sugar or silverware. So weird. But the food was great! No your typical breakfast joint so don't expect scrambled eggs. A little pricy and sides are a la carte in a way. Friendly service however  probably wouldn't come back. Coffee served from a self serve thermos...lol wasn't hot."}
{"text":"The old cashier threw plastic ware  in front of us rather handing it to us, it was very rude and disrespectful, big reason why we won't be returning.  Overall food was okay but the best"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I decided to come in to try this place out. Thr food is alright but the service here is terrible. The girl that took our order was nice and showed good customer service. The one that upset me the most was the elderly lady charging the order/making drinks. First I noticed she was coughing without covering her mouth. She was just coughing away from all the food/drinks. Second, she started asking questions about an order for the previous customer without even looking at them. How are you going to ask a customer what they want with your back facing toward them? I found that pretty rude. When it was finally our turn to pay for the food, she rushed everything even though she seemed to be taking her sweet time making the drinks. We waited a good while before she even checked us out for our order. She asked if we were military and my girlfriend said yes but I guess the worker didnt hear her. Mind you she didn't even look at us while she asked. She just ran the transaction through. When my girlfriend asked if she needed to see her military ID, she said that she asked and we didn't respond and to be fair she didn't give us much time to respond. She also just tossed our straws in front of us. I mean I know they are just straws but it's the image you are sending by doing that action. I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally our neighborhood has a cute bakery cafe. If you follow food truck culture, Lulu's On the Move truck retired and they opened this brick and mortar location. If you follow me, then you know I'm biased to things named Lulu seeing as \"Lulu Cooking Monstor\" was my special senior pugs name that she picked herself (Yes, I'm THAT dog cray lady. Yes, I let my dog pick their own name).   A quick spot to eat that has a relaxed and take your time feel is definitely a welcomed addition. It would be a good option for someone looking to study or get some work done as it is quiet, homey and has electrical plugs with cafe studying culture in mind.   It's a come to the counter and order type situation and they give you a order card to place at your table and they'll bring it to you. Instead of numbers its a flashcard with farm related things clipped to a reclaimed and glitter-ized soda bottle. The menu is small, but has enough selections and there are specials rolling out in the future. The case is of pastries and offers, again, small, but good selection. If you're wanting full cakes and huge selection and such, this spot is not.   We ordered -  S.O.B - a little skimpy on the chorizo, and the egg was over hard. I get many places don't want to do over easy as it makes for a mess, but at least a medium creamy yolk is preferred and perhaps would be nice to be able to give a choice. Still, the flavor was there when I took a bite that had a bit of each component. The bread I have to say was the best part. It was perfectly crunchy, soft, flaky and buttery in the way I want bread to be to make it addictive. I want more of that bread and that's a very good sign!   Pulled Pork - this was lightly smoky and bbq sauce tossed pork in a baguette with pickled carrots, daikon and cilantro. Basically, a bahn mi with a spin. Unlike the SOB this was very generous on the meat. I thought it was a solid sandwich. I added a bit of jalapeno tabasco and it was aces.   The BF and I were sharing and the SOB came out and we split it, ate it and waited around a bit until the pulled pork came. Minor hiccup and would have been more of a big deal if we were eating separate.   Also got a guava croissant which was pretty good! Now, it isn't like my holy grail cuban spot for guava cheese pie always served warm, but this still pleases me greatly and heals that craving for it. I will be coming for these on a regular I think.   French macarons are my favorite treat and theirs was just OK. The pistachio was chewy of a shell and biting into it made the filling spill out. The chocolate was a better consistency and wasn't chewy.   We were greeted hello and goodbye when we were by the door.They were friendly at the counter and register while talking us up. We did have someone walk up to us in the middle of eating to see how we were doing. It's not a full service spot so I got up to get refills of our waters myself. Prices weren't bad on the baked goods at all. Sandwiches weren't expensive, though I wish there was a combo type situation with them them to give better value. Still for lunch under $25 and we were full, it was still in a fair price.   While there were some hiccups that float it closer to a 3.5 star, this place is also barely a week old at the time of my visit. I'll give them that there is room to tweak things and grow, it's a good for it's first week. I will say this place has a lot of promise and the flavor is indeed there so I am fan already!  I'll be very excited to watch this place and hope it becomes a mainstay of our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for their fresh breads that are always delicious. Fresh Ingredients, fair prices, consistent product, a winning formula indeed!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute and the food was awesome, will definitely return. The casher was hilarious loved her. Had the burrito yummo."}
{"text":"It's a yuppie wannabe spot - within a great pizza spot. The staff was good and helpful but the food was bland....... nothing to return about and flies all about outside in the patio location due to trash all on the tables. Who cleans the tables??"}
{"text":"This cafe is around my house and I didn't even know about. It's hidden. They need to advertise more it.  I got lost a bit trying to find it. It's inside on the side of metro pizza. I been to metro pizza tons of times and was aware of this place.  I had their Benedict eggs with pork. They're really delicious. The pork was slowed cooked and you slow cooked pork taste the best. It's not I can go home and make it. That what I liked about it the most. The dish I I got took ten hours to prep. So i definitely be trying some of their other items in the near future."}
{"text":"Finally made my way over to this place around the corner since I was craving some french toast. The pictures always looked good, so that's what always attracted me.   The place is awesome. The service, the food, the building...loved everything.  We had the -  Tartine: Open-faced Sandwich, Eggs, Potatoes, Canadian Bacon, Hollandaise, and Asparagus.  This dish was very very good. It honestly doesn't look very appetizing, but it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  Stuffed French Toast with Raspberries and Peaches.  It was a little different than I expected, but it was still very good. It's pretty much like bread pudding sprinkled with powdered sugar and syrup.  Chocolate Croissant. It was a lot better than it looks as well. We were trying to decide between that and the Cheese Danish and the server recommended the chocolate. I will try the Cheese Danish next time.   Overall, everything was excellent. I loved the lady that was there, we thought she was Lulu, but to our disappointment, she was not. She is so friendly and warm, you just want to give her a big hug.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for some good breakfast or pastries. I can't wait to go back and try more things!!"}
{"text":"As always a wonderful brunch. Home made breads make the most awesome toast and you can't go wrong with the BBQ Benny."}
{"text":"The breakfasts are always classic staples with a twist. My favorite is the veggie hash while my boyfriend loves the more traditional hash with meat. The only reason  I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the wait time to order is usually super slow and the prices are a tad high for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Giving the review bump!  Came back for the Stuffed French Toast with Baked Apples :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lulus-bread-and-breakfast-las-vegas?select=1NM41iFq4JUlYAeyCM-QLw#1NM41iFq4JUlYAeyCM-QLw  They were out of this on opening day, so I told myself I would come back just for this!  It was great...and my favorite thing here so far!  Nice and warm, with great mix of sweet and filling.  Also tried the Maple Sweet Potato Hash and Eggs :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lulus-bread-and-breakfast-las-vegas?select=_66dfJCmNNvxcTr1ZQBg_Q#_66dfJCmNNvxcTr1ZQBg_Q  Good flavors here, but very sweet with the combination of maple and sweet potatoes!   I should have requested the eggs to be over-easy as well, since they didn't ask and served over-hard.  Skinny Lulu Sandwich:   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lulus-bread-and-breakfast-las-vegas?select=AGr5C-t_VmtdaO4XE0SbdA#AGr5C-t_VmtdaO4XE0SbdA  Egg White, Grilled Asparagus, Roasted Red Pepper Pesto, and Shaved Pecorino Romano. This was a good sandwich! Tasted healthy lol...but good!  The bread is pretty large too, so this is a good value.  I've also tried the Home made Lemonade, Strawberry Macaroon, and Cookie.:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lulus-bread-and-breakfast-las-vegas?select=OZRHnUwsRZky7Zp1_RKNIA#OZRHnUwsRZky7Zp1_RKNIA  I really like the lemonade! Macaroon very sweet, and Cookie was just ok...I'll stick with the croissants and savories here.  Service is very friendly here, and this time around they did check on us and pulled plates.  We will be back again :)"}
{"text":"I came here this morning to try something new in my area besides IHOP, cracked egg or babystacks. Upon entering me and my friend weren't greeted and were a bit confused regarding if it was a seat yourself spot or wait to be seated. Quickly noticed we could order and went up to the counter and bakery selection area. We had a baby with us and found our own high chair after spotting one as we had already settled down at a table. We moved to make space for the table. There were three ladies behind the counter who not only didn't greet us upon entering but didn't acknowledge us either after standing right in front of them. We had to ask for our own menu and I even mentioned it was our first time there. I asked for recommendations and she said one response \"everyone gets the egg Benedict with pulled pork\". Alright cool so my friend ordered that and I got the pastrami hash. Both our meals were below average in fact I only ate a few bites before the bland flavor was not worth the calories. Also, I ordered a chai tea latte which was the only decent thing there. It was hot and made just right with the right hint of chai flavor.  I guess our experience explains why we were the only individuals there. It's a cute little morning cafe however. Maybe a great location to have a private afternoon tea bridal shower at our gathering. Of course, with way better customer service."}
{"text":"My family and I love Lulu's Bread & Breakfast! We live in Henderson so it's a bit of a trek for us, but it is worth it! I believe it is owned by the Metro Pizza guys, if I'm not mistaken. The atmosphere is family-friendly and the food is delicious! Give it a try sometime! I haven't been on a weekday, so I'm not sure what the crowds are like during the week, but weekends do get busy. I've walked in at the perfect time and haven't had to wait at all. But I've also had a few visits with a pretty long wait. We just call that family bonding time. LOL The Lulu's Breakfast Burrito is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? Super mediocre at best. Food took a super long time (over 30 mins for 3 sandwiches). Watched the owner argue with a customer about his incorrect  order. The blueberry lemonade was good."}
{"text":"Nice place...very friendly staff, had a couple of breakfast items. The steak burrito was huge and made with fresh ingredients. Wife had a tartine with bacon, cheese, eggs made benedict style on nice fresh bread. This place, alongside Metro Pizza, is a nice addition to this part of town."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite on the way to Red Rock Canyon, and it was splendid. I was greeted warmly and menu items explained with patience. We ordered cream croissant, blueberry croissant, apple french toast, and Benicio del Porko. The food tasted 'homemade' - just delicious! The place had a really quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a sweet little place to meet your friend for a chat and a coffee. I had that benedicto thing and it was good... I didn't think the flavors melded as well as I'd hoped so I'll try something else next time. The atmosphere is worth going for. :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find :) We are new to the area and on a whim, decided to let our bellies give it a try. To our delight everything was perfect. The staff was not only friendly but lively, vivacious and just the right color of offbeat. The food was scrumptious to the point that my husband stopped a couple on their way in and actually asked if this was their first time. The couple of replied with a nod, sending my husband into a frenzy, exuberantly letting them know they were in for the biggest treat :-) .... Don't think about it, for the love of all that's holy just go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches and pastries in a quiet little cafe.  My wife and I went to Lulu's on their much anticipated opening day. We were greeted as we walked in the door by Robin (more about her later) who directed us up to the front counter to order. Kim very politely explained items on the menu, showed us the different pastries available behind the glass case, AND offered us a free slice of their chocolate bread. Very RICH. Very yummy! Owner, John (of whose mother the restaurant is named after) quickly began preparing our order. Later I had a brief but polite conversation with John who told of the history of his family and baking. Very nice man! As our order was being prepared, we stepped to the left to the cash register where we really met Robin. Robin is a delightful southern gal with an east coast attitude. Think if they took Carla from the Cheers TV Show and raised her in the south. Maybe it's Flo from Alice's Diner? Either way, Robin is quite a hoot and a key reason why many will be going back to Lulu's. She's rough, tough, almost abrasive, around the edges, but still a lovable delight who's charm and CARE for the customer and the products she serves shines through.  The food: I ordered the S.O.B sandwich (South of the Border). It came on a very soft bread with that flaky crustiness on the outside that's so hard to find. Inside, it was SO flavorful. A little bit of spice, but not too much. I wanted another right then, if I wasn't so full! Oh, and that I had a Raisin Custard Roll. Similar to a cinnamon roll, it's more moist, and no cinammoniness. My wife loved it, too. What my wife REALLY enjoyed, though, was the Sweet Potato Hash. It came with two eggs on top. The hash was sweet, maybe with a little fruit, and oh so tasty! She also got a guava croissant, whose filling was too sweet for her (maybe after the hash?) but was just perfect for me. Not like a jelly donut, the guava is such a unique flavor that, combined with the flaky croissant, was just fantastic! Drinks included an iced Vanilla Latte and Peach Ice Tea, both very good.   The restaurant sits right next to Metro Pizza, which I thought was their second location, as I've only been to the Tropicana/Maryland Parkway location. Apparently, there are six, all owned by John. It's wooden inside, like a cottage, with old signs around. Very classy, like you'd think a BED and breakfast would look.  I can't wait for the weekend: We'll be back and bring the kids. Definitely a new, fun, and incredibly delicious place to go!   Walt D in LV"}
{"text":"the only way I can see NOT giving this little gem 5 stars is when the kitchen bogs down.   small, quaint and wonderfully personable, the food is ALWAYS great as is the service.  come during the busy time and you will wait.   but this place is so worth it.  we love us some Robin,  or favorite crazy lady!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We adore mornings together here at Lulus.  The food and service are always top drawer! One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Lulu's is the REAL DEAL when it comes to both a great bakery and amazing breakfast/lunch cafe! I haven't been disappointed once with the food or the customer service...and I have been there more times than I can count. It is hands down, the best breakfast in town. Try the breakfast burrito (my favorite!), any of the stuffed French toast dishes, the sweet potato hash, the specials are always wonderful, even those that sound like odd combinations...somehow they always work, and the pastries and coffee...DELISH! You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My first time here. Wanted to try because of great reviews. Overall, I thought it was OK. I got one of the soft roll breakfast sandwiches (the SOB-chicken chorizo, pepper jack cheese and avocado spread (vs. avocado slices)) and coffee ($10). I love carbs-breads are my favorite and it was OK, didn't take a bite and think YUM! which I expect to do with place with a lot of 4 and 5 star ratings.  I am a sweets person too and you would think this place would reel me in. But everything looked super kinda overloaded with sugar and glazes (I.e, the generously frosted cinnamon roll-I do not have blood sugar problems but, the way this looked, I believe this could send someone into a diabetic coma with one bite). I wanted to try their version of the cronut but it was filled with white sugary creme, I think the cinnamon sugar on the top likely would have been enough for any normal sweets lover. Anyway everything in the pastry case was in the $4-$5 range so not inexpensive to dabble in and nothing screamed try me (it really screamed sugar overload).  Jury's out on whether I would go back (the location is not central for me. It would require planning with errands to the North)."}
{"text":"This place was probably one of the BEST local breakfast cafe's I've been to! Delicious food and the staff is incredibly friendly! I highly recommend this place to anyone.   My boyfriend had the benedict and I had the pastrami hash. We shared the cinnamon roll, which is a must whenever you visit! Full of flavor and tons of food! They're reasonably priced which I can appreciate. They also make their coffee in-house and tastes great!   5/5 for great service, amazing food and the fact that they're local!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The Cuban sandwich, the espresso, the tartine, the pork burrito. Seriously everything is awesome! There is usually always a line, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm only rating Lulu's 3 stars because of the prices.  I've been to both breakfast and lunch now and I have to say the breakfast seems to be the best value. I most recently got the jive Turkey for lunch and found it to be a little dry and definitely not worth it 8.23 (after military discount) price tag. I can buy 3/4lb turkey with loaf of bread for that much..   I guess I should have been happy because it is fresh baked bread but the slices are about 1 inch thick which is a little bit too much for just a few slices of turkey. I found myself taking off one side of the bread and eating it like an open face sandwich.  Overall a great atmosphere and very friendly staff I just wish it was a little bit cheaper. I definitely will continue taking my dates there in the morning!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I came for my birthday on a Monday and the service was great. The food was really good and the coffee was perfect. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My mom is a big fan of french bakeries and is super picky. I took her to this place and surprisingly she loved it! We even bought a whole thing of their french bread! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"There were so many things wrong with this place, which is a bummer since I've had this place bookmarked for ages. It's quite sad, really. Lulu's Bread & Breakfast offers breakfast options a la carte at combo meal prices. I'll start off with the bad.    After viewing a paper menu, you walk up to a counter and place your order. The employee writes it down on a pad and then rips it off, handing it to you to so that you can give it to the cashier. Wait, what? That whole ordering process is ridiculous. Why are there 2 people (3 including me) part of the ordering process? Why do I need to be handed this piece of paper at all?? It makes for a lot of confusion. My order was lost in the process, for example. Okay, I'm finished ranting.  I was feeling like a breakfast burrito and asked if I get one without avocado/onions. Nope, because the burritos (and french toast BTW) are pre-made!! WTF, over. What kind of breakfast joint makes their burritos in the early AM and then reheats them up later to give to customers? Rant 2 done.  VEGETARIAN TARTINE ($7.95): I settled on the tartine. It came with 2 eggs on Toscana bread, with a balsamic spring mix and cherry tomatoes layered on top. The bread was super duper hard and I had to exert a lot of effort cutting the toast with my dull knife. My dad said it looked like I was getting a workout. 3/5  BREAKFAST BURRITO ($7.95?): My mom got this and she said it was pretty good, but nothing special. 3/5   SIDE OF EGGS, SAUSAGE AND BACON: My dad likes traditional breakfasts, so we had to make him a custom order. His reaction was \"What the heck is this?\". But, after giving it a try he said the food tasted better than it looked. 3/5  ICED CHAI TEA AND SEASONAL RASPBERRY COFFEE ($8.92): I splurged on some specialty drinks. Prices were Starbucks steep for two small drinks. For some reason, Lulu's doesn't believe in Fountain drinks and only sells small glass bottles of regional beverages. I like my refills, so I wasn't too happy about that. 4/5   SERVICE: Employees were great except the manager. Que the evil music. She was an older lady with glasses and she was the RUDEST person ever, for no reason! She was the one ringing people up. She was short, impatient, and had an attitude. I could tell the younger employees were intimated of her and felt bad for them. She never smiled and glared at my family. No customer skills at all! This is why I bumped Lulu's down to two stars instead of three. 1/5  Worth a Return Visit? If it wasn't for the rude manager I would have been willing to give this place a second try. Looks like that's not going to happen.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #86"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Dutch Crunch Roll with Spicy Tomato Jam, Eggs, Avocado, Bacon French Country Ricotta Toast with Nectarine, Cherry, Pistachio, Mint Cheese Pizza with Caputo new Americana Flour Fried Churro French Toast Sticks with Raspberry Compote and Dulce de Leche Pina Colada French Toast with Banana Pudding Custard, Pineapple, Whipped Cream and Cherries French Country Mushroom Toast with White Bean-Mushroom Hummus, Wild Arugula, Poached Egg and Red Pepper  Although Metro Pizza has long been the flag-bearer for Las Vegas' now-internationally relevant Pizza scene only select locals are aware of Lulu's Bread and Breakfast, the cozy dining nook attached to Metro's Skypointe Drive location run by Chris Decker.  Originally visited as a tourist in 2013 and again in August 2015, the intervening months and rise of Instagram seeing the Chef's @everythingbutanchovies account become a test-kitchen and showcase for ideas that only a few lucky people besides Chris ever get to taste, it was with the goal of understanding exactly what lies ahead that two diners sat down Saturday morning, a five-course tasting very encouraging should any of these dishes eventually see the light day.  No stranger to the space itself, a pair of educational Pizza courses hosted by the legendary John Arena taking place within the counter-order kitchen since the last daytime visit to Lulu's, it was moments after entry that the Binghamton New York native offered his greetings, an early morning of deliveries to DTLV spots like Vesta already completed and a full day on the line yet to come.  Still featuring many of the same Pastries, Benedicts and staff members as last time, an elderly woman prone to calling everyone 'baby' or 'honey' adding a homey sort of charm to Lulu's ever since the beginning, it was with water poured that ten minutes passed before the meal got started, Chris' daily inspiration a sweet Dutch Crunch Roll with crackling Rice Flour playing well off fluffy Eggs, smashed Avocado and Tomato Jam plus two strips of Bacon.  Always working with new recipes, the Bread selection ranging from Pretzel to Semolina to Sourdough depending on the day, course two saw Lulu's French Country Loaf sliced, toasted and topped with Ricotta Cheese, fresh Fruit and crumbled Pistachios, Nectarines and Cherries at the peak of freshness playing well off torn Mint with John Arena subsequently making an appearance of his own carrying two slices of crispy Cheese Pizza created with Caputo's new autolysing Flour.  Stating that in its final form the Ricotta Toast would feature housemade Cheese it was here that Chef Decker continued to move from savory to sweet, the Churro French Toast presented in a Jenga-style configuration of Deep-fried Bread topped with Cinnamon Sugar and Dulce de Leche alongside intense Raspberry Compote every bit as good as it sounds while the Pina Colada French Toast was an elegant Dessert-for-Breakfast sort of dish featuring buttery Brioche completely saturated with Banana Pudding beneath a ring of Pineapple next to Whipped Cream, Toasted Coconut and Maraschino Cherries for garnish.  Opting to finish up savory, though plenty of Pastries were still available should more have been desired, it was once again on toasted French Country Loaf that Chris sent out two slices topped in White Bean Hummus and Roasted Mushrooms, the flavors robust and woodsy with a bit of heat added by Red Pepper Flake and all of it coming together nicely as carried by a poached Egg Yolk."}
{"text":"Warning: This place can be tricky to find, unless you already know it's there.   If you're looking for a traditional American breakfast, then you've come to the wrong place. I mean, you can have homemade granola and yogurt, but why? Especially when they boast of having an award winning Benicio Del Porko.    During my last visit, I ordered an egg white sandwich which had asparagus and was served on a bread that must be kin to a croissant. It was both heaIthy and delicious. It also helped me to justify eating one of Lulu's soft chocolate chip cookies. As a matter of fact, I've stopped by a few times just for the cookies.   The workers are about as sweet as their cookies and give off a down home vibe. The manager is a doll and an absolute delight every time I see her.  If you live in the Northwest, then you have no excuse not to check them out. For everyone else, the drive is certainly worth it."}
{"text":"I like this place and go pretty frequently. I get the Farm House breakfast sandwich, egg over-medium with the bacon extra crispy. Black coffee to drink.  I've found that if I don't order the bacon extra crispy, sometimes it can be a little under-done, but the sandwich, overall, is one of my favorites ever in the breakfast sandwich category.   Service is always friendly. Give the sandwich orders a little time, they're made to order and not super speedy, but worth the wait. They have a lot of pastries that are ready to go if you're up for swift and sweet."}
{"text":"Good concept, cute place, OVER STAFFED, Very UNORGANIZED, CONFUSION, UNPROFESSIONAL, the bathroom is located right in front of the kitchen (very uncomfortable), the younger gentlemen making the food decided to wipe his nose and scratch his ears with his gloves, then prepare my food because of this they gave me a free sample of there cookies to taste, the cookies were DISGUSTING. If you guys don't change these things fast this place will be bankrupt in 4 months give or take. It's a shame too, because Vegas needs a place like this. FIX THESE PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY AND YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE A CHANCE."}
{"text":"Does this place even need more Yelp reviews at this point? Probably not! The food here is fantastic. Anything I would say would be redundant. If you are in this part of town it is absolutely worth checking out. The only negative is that the portions are not huge and the food is so good that you're looking at an empty plate much sooner than you want to be."}
{"text":"...if you can find it- a great spot for breakfast and lunch...great Cuban coffee and my friend had a breakfast burrito which was inhaled...."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast when they are not too busy.  Food is creative and great quality.  Wish it was table service on those days when the lines are long.  Would be nice to sit down and have coffee while we wait instead of standing in a long line."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday brunch. I wasn't too thrilled they ran out of anything with Nutella. I didn't have a plan B so I had to dig deep and figure out what I want to eat. They had 2 frittatas of the day: bacon or goat cheese and zucchini. I got a Bacon Frittata (with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach) which came with a salad and 2 slices of fresh, warm, crisp and very yummy bread baked in-house. I love frittata and I love bacon so this was a hit.  My friend got a Tartine - an open-faced sandwich with eggs, potatoes, Canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce and asparagus. Very tasty and filling.  They also have palmier, macarons and all sorts of cookies and pastries. The service was wonderful. Plenty of space even though they were busy. The S-curve table in the middle has electrical outlets to plug on your portable devices which is a big plus in my book!  My friend got me a Nutella pastry and a guava pastry here before which were both good and flaky. Yum! I have to come here early next time."}
{"text":"Update and bumping down to 1 star.  Here's the yelp compliment sent to me by the employee:  \"Girl, take some midol! They usually work for cramps like you!  I HATE serving people like you,  makes me want to accidentally spill something on you!  You probably squirmed out of a tip!!!!  Go get the midol and eat at home! This place is amazing\"  Hard to believe people like this work with the public. The restaurant itself is so pretty inside... too bad the management's attitude is so very, very ugly. Does \"Lulu\" or the owner know about this?"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the city. For once, I will count it as a blessing that I have friends on this side of town. Before having to submit some paperwork, I was able to sneak in some Lulu's.   All the hype building up to its opening had made me anxious to go try. Once you walk into the bakery, it feels like you are transported out of Vegas. It is quaint with its brickwork, large windows and high ceilings.   The food is amazing. I wish there was one in the Southeast. I got the maple sweet potato hash and was blown away by the portion for $6. The first few bites made me think that it was vegetarian. I didn't get any meat in it. Then halfway through I came across bits. It could have gone either way and I would have been happy. It comes with two fried eggs and a piece of toast that has been pressed. Although that was good, the guava croissant was my favorite from the trip. It possessed a flaky exterior, was not too sweet, and the filling had just the right amount so that nothing comes out when you bite into it. The biggest disappointment were the macarons. They are small and did not have the right texture."}
{"text":"The decor was great, brick façade marble tabletops, very bistro. I had the blueberry peach French toast it came with syrup but with the fresh whipped cream you hardly needed it. It was lovely! Was more like a bread pudding but was so good! I took a couple of the butter croissants home for later and all I can say is that they were little bites of heaven! Omgosh! Best croissants I have ever had. I hit any French bakery that opens in town and these were by far the best!"}
{"text":"I've waited long enough to write this... but after my first visit I have made several subsequent trips so I have more knowledge of the menu:) I've had several of the menu items and can honestly say i haven't disliked any of them. The Benecio del Porko is so flavorful and unique, it's hard to order anything else. The sweet barbecue pork and the charred corn kernels are brilliant.  The tartines are all solid choices as well. I think their novelty is in the texture as well as taste, the crunchy grilled toscano bread stands up nicely to the hollandaise sauce and egg yolk. The \"something else\" had a nice rosemary taste combined with the flaky crust and mushrooms with melted cheese. The lattes are delicious too!! The pumpkin spice latte is divine. The service is spectacular, they're so friendly and helpful it's almost unbelievable. The wonderful cashier is a hoot as well, always cheerful and clever.  I've brought numerous friends and family members here, all have had no complaints. The fact that this location is a five minute walk from my house helps!   The desserts are sinfully amazing! The \"one of those\" is my kryptonite.  I'll see you this weekend Lulu!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so overly priced for everything. The food looks better in rubber in their display case."}
{"text":"It's such a bummer because this place has great food and coffee but the service, particularly from whom I am assuming is the owner (elderly woman at the register) is horrific. I'm not sure if it was because it was busy but WOW this lady has a sour attitude. She asked me how many spoons I needed from the other end of the register so I didn't hear her well the first time when she asked. She proceeded with \"SPOONS! How many spoons do you want??\" And if that wasn't enough she followed that with an eye roll. Are you kidding me, lady? I'm sorry my business is an inconvenience to you. She should really take and apply the service that her wonderful workers give."}
{"text":"I live about 10 mins away from LuLu's and I am consistently craving their food. The breakfast pastries are huge and amazing. Took home a 4 pack of some freshly made brioche buns last week and they were delicious too. However, it is the constantly changing menu that keeps me coming back. They have a solid menu of tried and true breakfast sandwiches and popular offerings but the seasonal items area so unique and fun to try. Get there early to ensure the best selection, as menu items sell out each day. I personally don't eat eggs but I've been able to find something crave worthy every trip.  My fav is the french toast. Sometimes it has apples and cinnamon this week it has peaches and raspberries. Delicious! But it's not your cookie cutter french toast. It's more like a soft bread pudding. Oh my gosh!  I've also chowed down the Cuban sandwich a few times and its a pork filled wonderland for $8.50. Which brings me to the fact that prices here are so refreshing. Meaning they are appropriate for what you are receiving. A large sandwich with fresh ingredients on homemade bread would be like $12-$15 anywhere else in Vegas.  But the best part of Lulu's is the wonderful staff that works here. Every single person has been kind, welcoming and eager to always answer any questions we may have. They are awesome :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good breakfast and stumbled upon Lulus. When I walked in everyone was so welcoming. The girl who took my order was very nice and explained how the menu worked. When I went to check out the lady was so warm and nice. And to top it all off. The food was absolutely incredible! Thank you Lulus!! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened and fell in love with this place, but have found myself coming here less and less.   The good: They use fresh quality ingredients, and have unique menu items. They also switch up the menu with new seasonal items. Some of my favorites are their salted caramel latte, guava croissant, and bacon egg potato tartine. The staff is friendly.   Things that irk me: They don't bake fresh pastries every day. Seems like Saturdays are their main baking days with the best selection. Here it is a Sunday with a line of people, yet the display case looks pathetic with one or two pieces of a few different pastries. Basically left overs. I've also come in mid week and found the same. Also if you don't come in right when they open you may miss out on their daily specials, not enough to make it thru the day.   I really like the food, if and when it's still available."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is just a regional deference that  I am having a hard time adjusting to. I'm going to start off this review with the customer service . For starters the ordering system was, weird, inefficient and at times problematic. Upon walking in it appears as a cafe with a chalkboard sign greeting you at the door. Displaying the the list of lattes and coffee like drinks that they are serving . You get in line were a stack of paper flyer style menu slowly becomes in reach just before you get to the first station were you place your oder (note: there are no food menus displayed) you order, as in my experience they are out of the item you'd like at 11:00 in the day. Or as in my husband's experience take out the cold pastry sitting In The display case and warm  it in the microwave. Then you go the next station to order and pay . You'd  think this were you get your food . No. It is not, this is where the condescending woman at the cash register gives you a place card and tells you to seat yourself . This is also where you get confused and sit in the restaurant next door if their dinning room is in over flowing but be careful were you sit because only some of their seats are reserved for LuLu's overflow some are not. This is also were we sat waiting for a very long time for our subpar food to arrive. We settled in long enough to observe different waitresses wandering about, and looking for different place cards to deliver. Having not seated the patrons themselves  it plates, this was almost entertaining to watch . And I say almost, maybe if we'd had our less than mediocre food at the time it would have been a bit more enjoyable to watch. Alas it wasn't and the food near inedible . Bland and badly executed. Needles to say we did not enjoy our time or food here at all ."}
{"text":"They have amazing pastries here- but I wasn't very impressed by the stuffed french toast. Also, what is with the loaves of bread left out? Are those what we can pick from if we want some bread? They are just out there by the line, and anyone can sneeze or finger them. Ew.  Anyways, I really liked the croissant I got (I had it with Nutella xD) it was flaky and light, and very tasty! All of the breads and pastries looked amazing, and were reasonably priced considering they are fresh made.  I did not like the stuffed french toast at all (we got the apple and raisin), it was bland and had way too much egg batter on it that most of it turned out to be mush.   I will come back to try some other breakfast item, since I really do want to give this place more stars."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed! Okay it's cute, okay it's one of the only breakfast spots up north...but it doesn't make up for the fact we waited over 45 minutes for our food.  Or the fact that I mentioned I had a dairy allergy, so I removed the bread from the sandwich and made sure nothing was cooked with butter.  The BAT ship crazy sandwich says egg, avocado, bacon, tomato relish with no mention of cheese on the menu.  Lo and behold...two slices of cheese on my breakfast, even after asking about dairy!  Thank you Lulu for my infant's milk protein allergy flair!  The food was just okay.  The side of hash browns was the saddest looking thing I've ever seen....limp potatoes that seemed like they needed to be cooked for at least another 5 minutes.  I would much rather eat at the Aliante buffet for breakfast.  I was thinking I could guarantee there was no dairy in my food if I went to restaurant, boy was I wrong.  Not worth the price or the wait."}
{"text":"Nice Bakery located on the north end of town on the way to Mt. Charleston. Fresh bread and pastries daily with award winning egg's benedict called the \"Benecio\": A fried egg, served with crispy pulled pork, smothered with bbq sauce and loaded on top of a sweet cornbread slice. I can see why it won a Best-of-Vegas award! A little on a sweet side and needs the green tabasco or some jalapeno chutney would be good too. I also prefer my cappucino served in a real cup instead of togo when my food comes on a plate but I was so distracted to with nutella crossant, I was a happy camper overall. Server was such a hard worked we were happy to leave a $5 tip. This place is also connected to a pizza spot so you can order a slice or beer if your party has different tastes!"}
{"text":"We love the personal service, thank you Robin and the ladies. We think the food is terrific too. You won't find this cafe/bakery breakfast at the fast food joint!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. It certainly has potential to be better. It seems to have a fairly decent crowd. There's a good amount of items to choose from on the menu. The restaurant is very cute in its decor. The lady running the register (LuLu maybe?) was a little rough around the edges and barking slightly harsh orders to her worker bees. The dining room has no window treatments so you need sunglasses to eat there in the morning or you can sit next door or outside. I got the spinach tartine, which was good not outstanding. They forgot to cook my egg well done and fixed that...not a big deal. For $10, you would think it would come with a side of fruit or hash browns. The hubs got the captain America. He had no complaints and it looked tasty. We got one of the chocolate peanut butter buckeyes which was super tasty."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful service. I had peanut butter and banana French toast and my husband had Benecjo Del Porko..cornbread, pulled pork, hollandaise, corn and cilantro with an egg. both were amazing.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The last who rang me up was nice if a little brisk at first.   They were essentially out of fresh bread which was sad as that was something we went there specifically for. Got the Cuban and the dirty chips (smothered pulled pork over potato chips). I think the pulled pork chops were the star of this meal. Great flavor!  The Cuban coffee I didn't enjoy the way I did in Florida, but my partner did. I found it to be too bitter and missing that innate sweetness that I expect with my Cuban coffee.  We had plenty of leftovers and they kept well for later. Will come back one day, for sure."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience! Thank you for such great food and hospitality. I could never give this place a bad review. Robin is the nicest lady, makes you feel like family. Her employees are just as nice. I hope this place sticks around, please support lulus!!"}
{"text":"Omg it was delicious. Service was top notch as well. I've come back numerous times. The owner is an absolute sweetheart and the friendliest cat I've ever met.  Go here. Eat well. Be happy"}
{"text":"This was the cutest breakfast place. The sweet potato hash was great, and my 10 month old ended up eating most of it. I will come back many times to come."}
{"text":"Went one morning and the older woman whine the counter there was rude. The other employees were as well. Nobody asked us if we needed help or a seat and it was our first time there. We ended up leaving. Never been back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone here a few times. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is cute.  I wish they had a little bit more of a drink selection in addition to coffee. It is a bit pricey for breakfast/lunch but it is good food. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"So I stumbled upon this cool little eatery, not by accident, but after asking a co worker where they would like to do for her birthday since she is always coordinating events for everyone in the office.  She thought about it then said the secret word, \"Lulu's!\"  It was music to my ears, especially since I have been screaming for an excuse to go there considering it is over 30 miles from home.  I only heard good things and was eager to check it out.  Upon arrival, I was surprised to see how big the place was and in a well established area in Skypointe.  This would actually be a solid spot on the way to Mt. Chuckleston for some ice snowboarding, but that's another story.    You could find Lulu's nestled right next to Metro Pizza, in fact, I heard the good ol' Lulu was the mother of the founder of Metro, but not sure how much truth is in that.  Anyone care to verify?  I will not elaborate on the menu since there are monthly specials and I think it will only be fair for you to come and check out the offerings in person, like I did.  The online website was not informational, does not do justice needs work but make the trip and you won't regret it.    The joint is very well kept and managed and the staff is extremely pleasant, very important for people trying to kick off their days.  Plus this may be the only place I can be called \"honey\" in front of the fiance without getting punched in the throat.  The food was superb and you can tell they put some thought and effort into the dishes.  For you sweet-tooths', you will find macaroons, pastries, hot drinks and much more.  In addition, the Metro Pizza next door is fairly new and includes a well supplied bar. #typsytime  In closing, I enjoy the subtle considerations, such as little rubbish cans near any handle that may need to be accessed.  Even the pizza boys room had Zero 7 playing...so sick..  Even if you factor the drive, the place is not bad, but that is the only thing that prevented me from adding another star to my rating."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! The layout was a little confusing from the moment that you drive up. We sat ourselves and upon looking around noticed that you actually have to go up to the counter to order. At first glance of their paper menu I was a little disappointed. We were able to order off of the lunch menu thankfully. After we sat down is when we noticed that there actually was a greeter that meets you at the front door. We also noticed that the greater was handing out 2 menus to people when they came in the door. That might have been nice to know since the first menu we saw left a lot to be desired. It took about 15 minutes to get two sandwiches, which didn't become frustrating until we noticed that the people that came in after us were already served and eating. I would be willing to try this place again, hoping that it was just a fluke. I did notice that the people that were around us were getting good customer service. The food it what saved the experience for me."}
{"text":"Delicious food -- especially the bread! The staff was super friendly and very helpful when asked to recommend something. Can't wait to go back and try more of their specials!"}
{"text":"Get the Benicio Del Porko, that is all.  We pass this place all the time and finally had a chance to actually dine here after a morning hike.  I know there are other items on the menu, but I was so blown away by this dish that I'd come back just for it.  This item lives up to its stellar namesake with its BBQ pulled pork, hollandaise sauce, charred corn, cilantro, over easy eggs atop grilled cornbread.  Who thought of this wonderful creation?!  Give them an award STAT, whichever the Academy Award there is for food that blows you away!  Just yum.  The end."}
{"text":"Benicio bravo!! I call it the corn bread pulled pork yummy goodness that makes my morning better stuff!!  The pastries are amazing, some mornings I can't decide on pork yuminess or one of those so I don't, I have both!! It's a bit pricey when you throw in a coffee but it's totally worth it.  Easily one of the best breakfasts in town!!"}
{"text":"I am giving one star on the mere customer service our family received. The elderly woman at the register needs a hug in her life, cause the way she treated us was uncalled for. I asked the simple question, if I needed to place the order at the other part of the counter and she rudely answered \"well if you look, that's what they're doing\". If that wasn't bad enough, my mother in law asked for straws and she threw them. I guess handing them over or placing them on the counter was too difficult. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, stayed for a while after breakfast and did some work on my computer using their wifi. The manager asked how I liked my breakfast and when I said I preferred my friends to my own she offered to make me a new breakfast free of charge. When I declined she brought us over a fresh baked cookie on the house and said she hoped we'd return. Service was outstanding and I highly recommend the break burrito!"}
{"text":"First of all.i love the decor!!and really comfy to stay.The owner was really nice n when we went there,it didn't take long to get the food.i think less than 10min.i wish if ice coffee taste better.But definitely I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Original delicious breakfasts make this a star restaurant in the northwest.  The eggs Benedict, egg sandwiches and breakfast meals are really mouth-watering delicious.  Portions are generous and service is attentive.  Breads are fresh and sides are scrumptious.  Expresso drinks could be better and orange juice too, but, with or without a kitchen, I love the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food with yummy flavor combos, super funny New Yorker at the register, puppies allowed outside on the patio! :) Love this place"}
{"text":"Been coming here almost weekly. Every time I come here I try a new coffee that the hostess suggests and every time it becomes my new favorite drink. They breakfast sandwiches are amazing! They consistently update their menu for new and fresh items. I usually get the Herman. Try the white mocha peanut butter latte, It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow. Took 45 minutes for a salad and a sandwich...and my bread was burned. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"I went in this morning to try something out. There were no customers but the interior looked nice. I went up to the counter to order some coffee and and a breakfast burrito. They were \"out of burritos\" - the old lady sassed at me at me a bit, not even looking up at me. I checked the rest of the menu and nothing else looked that good. I was hangry, the lady got pissed because I ordered the wrong thing, and I left without ordering anything else."}
{"text":"This little gem is AMAZING!!!!! I went on yelp a couple of months ago to find somewhere  cute and fun for breakfast.  I saw this place, and we have not stopped coming back!!  The staff is always so, so friendly and the (I'm guessing) owner who always works the register is fantastical!  My husband and I have tried a couple different things off the menu, and nothing we have tried has disappointed!  Everything always tastes incredible."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I had in a long time.  I had the Benicio del Porko. Original flavor combination that works just so well together.  Friendly staff and owner/manager is just a hoot.  Great place"}
{"text":"A warm smile, a \"coming right up, baby doll\", and a delicious breakfast are the key combo at Lulu's. I've stopped here several times for a quick breakfast to-go on my way out of town, but finally stayed long enough on my last trip to eat in. Everything is delicious including the pastries (get the pineapple muffin), yogurt parfait (with housemade granola), Lulu's breakfast burrito (it's huge!), and The New Year's Resolution breakfast quesadilla (my fave!). The coffee is good too and refillable. The bread and breakfast side can get busy in the morning, but there's no need to worry about it because they open up the pizzeria for seating as well. Great find in the NW valley!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant was tucked away, but well worth the find. The staff was very helpful and excited about life. After deep contemplation, I went with a coffee and eggs Benny; who would have thought. This eggs Benny was like no other. The base was homemade corn bread. The meat was bbq pulled pork (made in house). Hollandaise with roasted corn straight off the cob! WOW  Tasty tasty tasty  I wanted the cinnamon bun. Next time"}
{"text":"This has become our weekend breakfast spot. Every time we come the food is amazing! My favorite is the Pastrami Hash, my wife's is the breakfast burrito. Can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"We had some trouble finding LuLu's- it's tucked away by a pizzeria- but I'm so glad we kept looking for it! Breakfast here is AMAZING. We had veggie hash and the BBQ cornbread hollandaise dish. Cozy atmosphere and warm, welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was more bakery than restaurant but maybe I was wrong. I was surprised there wasn't more bread for sale. All they had were some French loaves, pretzel rolls, and brioche rolls. This selection seems to vary on a daily basis.   Luckily I was just there for some food. I got the Captain America breakfast sandwich. It has ham AND sausage, cheddar and an egg cooked to your liking on a super light and flakey roll. It's a little heavy with the double meat but tasty nonetheless.   I've seen some other reviewers griping about \"pre-made\"...I think they may be confusing pre-made with 'already prepared'. The kitchen area doesn't appear too big so, yes, it appears the make some things prior so they can heat them up. But things like eggs, etc. are freshly cooked. I don't think it's a big deal and it seems like a necessity based on their kitchen facilities."}
{"text":"First time. We tried based on how many yelp stars. Wasn't impressed much. Food tastes like it's reheated and wasn't freshly made. Bread on Sloppy Jose was old. I love bread --- I can tell if it's fresh and a day old. Service is great... friendly, smiling. Coffee was ok... like gas station grade.  Enough to say it'll be a tough thinking whether to try this place again."}
{"text":"So, although everything tastes super fresh, apparently it's not as fresh as it seems. Everything is already pre-made and then just reheated as people order, which is fine, considering their service is pretty quick. My food last time still tasted pretty good, so I'm not too horribly upset about it, but it does suck when you order something and they're out of it and since things aren't made as you order, they can't just go make you the dish you want at that time. I ordered a different dish and asked if they could modify it for me since it didn't contain any meat, the girl that took my order was totally nice about it and said \"of course\" but then the older lady at the cash out counter kind of made it seem like it'd be an inconvenience since it's already pre-made, the last time I came here she was super nice, so today I could've done without the slight attitude. I was fine with my turkey grilled and then placed on top of my spinach stuffed croissant, although this dish in general wasn't near as good as the one I got on my last visit. Who knows, maybe the cashier lady was tired and maybe they pre-make everything really early in the morning and that's why they state everything is \"fresh\" but I was still kind of bummed by today's visit. I'll still give them the benefit of the doubt since the lady was a bit nicer as we were getting ready to leave but we still probably won't be back as often as we originally thought."}
{"text":"Just saw this while driving by. It was great. So happy to have a place nearby that does scratch cooking. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here and it definetly wont be the last!  I got the Captain America sandwich and it was very yummy indeed!  Just added some ketchup cuz breakfast sandwhiches are always better with ketchup!  I also go their signature coffee (hot) i forgot what it was callled but something along the lines of salted carmel and it was very good as well!  The environement is very cute and comforting, although i  sat outside for some fresh air.  They have a wonderful display of baked goods. Really makes you want to cheat on your diet and i'm sure i will one day. Their staff was very welcoming, mostly young adults/teens, very respectful and great customer service.  Also, free wifi that i can write this review! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a spot that I frequent on a regular basis and couldn't be more happy that it is so close to home. Not only is the atmosphere cute and inviting, but the people are all so sweet and accommodating also! The FOOD!!! - divine! They use all the ingredients I can appreciate and don't get much of at a regular breakfast spot. My favorite is the Skinny LuLu- the bun is fantastic, the sundried tomato pesto is of course something special. They've really come to perfect the iced coffee and espresso drinks (that was a little shaky in the beginning, but its not starbucks anyways) The pastries are always on point! I have no complaints and hope they are around for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was adorable. You can tell the owner takes pride in her restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious.  It's a little bit more expensive that the chain restaurants but worth the few extra dollars.  We have never been disappointed at Lulu\"s."}
{"text":"Tried Lulu's on a whim, just wanted something for breakfast and was very pleased with the menu selections, nothing too deep by the right amount of offerings with something for everyone. Will have to come back for lunch sometime soon and hoping to make it back on a weekend soon as well. Service was curtious, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the business love the customer service, especially the manager she is AMAZING not only is she friendly bit she takes time to know her customers!! Every time we walk in it's like being at home!! If you haven't tried the Yogurt Parfaits you are missing out!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this service is so slow. Waited over 50 minutes.  Horrible. Plus the woman at the cash reg is rude. The burrito left a gelatinous coating of cheese goo in our mouth, the Herman pretzel sandwich was bland and unappetizing and the apple stuffed French toast made our son throw up on his plate. Literally..."}
{"text":"1st time here at Lulu's and I'm not impressed. The stuffed French toast is basically a tasteless bread pudding. The frittata was just ok. And the breakfast potatoes were plain and rubbery. I'm giving two stars because the toast was delicious (country French bread made in house) and my latte was very good.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I had one of the most amazing breakfast experience. Great, super friendly staff and nice setup. Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict is incredible!"}
{"text":"Came her for brunch. The ladies were super friendly and very helpful. Showed us their meals and explained each one to us. Food came out pretty quick and every thing was delicious. Me and wifey split the Benicio de toro, daughter had stuffed French toast, I had open face sandwich and wifey had gompa sandwich.  We killed it all!  Ok we did end up taking half of the Benicio deal toro home.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Probably the most amazing white mocha I've ever had! The customer service was excellent and the food was delicious.  I got the mashed red potato topped with cheese & bacon, sourdough toast, and 2 eggs over easy. I loved that they garnished the eggs with franks hot sauce and crushed flaming hot Cheetos. It was a great add."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place in NW! It was hard trying to find this place; It's so hidden next to Metro Pizza.. Anyhow, great place and friendly staff.. try their signature dish \"Benicio Del Porko\" with fresh squeezed orange juice! I had a great breakfast! We're definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Not a traditional bed and breakfast with traditional breakfast items. A bakery with no breakfast bagels? Food mediocre and poor food selection."}
{"text":"Please disregard the lady that gave this place one star. I'm sorry she couldn't find the menus, but they are paper copies in multiple locations around the order area. I'm sure if she politely asked someone if they had a menu they would help her. Her take on the food is obviously a personal opinion so I won't dog her for that.   I came on a Saturday around noon for a late breakfast. They have fresh baked loaves of bread, pastries, and cookies so my roommates parents came along for some amazing sourdough. The place was busy but by the time you look over the menu you won't have a wait. I had a \"Herman\" sandwich. Egg, sausage, Munster, ground mustard on a pretzel roll. It was about 6 bucks and very tasty. Fresh OJ for a few dollars and a Nutella croissant for 3.50. The dining area is nice and bright. All of the food was good to great quality and the OJ is fresh made so it's an absolute home run for me. If you live in the north/north west. It's an awesome location. Would I drive from the central/south part of town? Probably not unless you like their bread. But if you live or run errands in the region it's a great place. I live by the shooting park so I'll probably become a regular for my Saturday brunch cravings."}
{"text":"I never knew bbq sauce and hollandaise went good together . But I do now and I thank this place for it the people are amazing and the atmosphere of the place makes you feel like your eating breakfast at your grandma's house."}
{"text":"OK food, CRAPPY SERVICE : \"I WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS!!!!\"  I yelped this place when my father in law came to visit. Both his legs are amputated and it is difficult for him to stand around with prosthetics. (He was wearing shorts, so I know they saw he was struggling). A girl have us 3 pieces of paper and said here is the menu, you order back there. Names on the menu didn't make sense so as I am trying to decipher what each item is for my father in law we started ordering. Apparently order here means order only your food here. Drinks orders are taken by the register! When I got to the register, this old hag started giving me attitude over my not knowing what size drink I want. (Here is the deal: if it's not on your menu, I can't divine an answer for you!!!!!!) so then the hag decided hand me 2 cups with clear syrup; which didn't add any flavour what so ever to the coffee and told me I go fill it up myself. Shall I tip myself too??? Then she gave us a soda bottle with a bike picture on it to notify our \"server\" where we are sitting. The so called cinnamon roll was caked with icing, and was freezing cold! Coupled with this shitty service, I would NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN!!!!!!"}
