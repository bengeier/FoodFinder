{"text":"I really liked this place. The space is nice and open and the waiter was extra friendly and attentive. Maybe too attentive, but after drinking some wine he grew on me.

Started with the popcorn crusted scallops. Loved the combo of corn and scallops. My entree was the duck. Cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the porterhouse pork. That was great too. For dessert we had a rich chocolate cake. Yum.  We'll probably go back."}
{"text":"A couple of our friends and my wife and I went into Fat Cat for a drink on a Friday evening.  Every place at San Marcos is packed on Friday night but there were only 2 tables occupied (that should have told us something!).  We went to the bar area and ordered after dinner drinks.  When we got the bill, the drinks were $.50 higher each than on the menu.  The waitress said drinks ordered \"on the rocks\" were higher.  I have never heard of this and I travel extensively.  When we left, we mentioned to the manager the extra charge.  He stated \"I have never heard of it\".  Obviously, we won't be going back for drinks or food!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and creative.  The portions are a bit small for the price.
The service is very good and the staff is very friendly.  I also like the changes they have made and it is very comfortable. 
I hope they get more menu items and add more to happy hour.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a really great atmosphere. You can sit indoors or out. The staff is all very attentive and friendly. 

We were just walking by and decided to stop for a drink. We didn't stay for dinner because we already had plans elsewhere, but glancing at the dinner menu, everything looked really yummy. 

I hope to come back and try the food. Some of their specialty cheeses sounded great. 

We really enjoyed Fat Cat and hope it survives in this economy."}
{"text":"To start they have 4 beers on tap - two from local company SanTan Brewing and two Belgian style - including Trippel Carmelite. The bone in Fillet Mignon was so tender, I didn't even need a knife to cut it. This was served along with bone marrow, which was strange but delicious! Comfortable atmosphere and friendly, yet inexperienced servers. Growing pains I suppose. This place a has a great future and is a total step away from the previous 98 south concept. It's nice to see new restaurants in downtown Chandler!"}
