{"text":"Terrible service. We waited 50 minutes between finishing appetizers and the arrival of the main course. Bruno came to Our table and chit chatted about basically nothing for 10 minutes while our food got cold . Overkill at its finest . Will not go back"}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant in Oakville! Some dishes are better than others. The oxtail cavatelli and funghi pizza and zeppole are must haves. The antipasto plate is also amazing. The staff are very friendly.  We held a big brunch event here, as well, and were very satisfied with food and service. They went above and beyond for us. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but overpriced for what it was. The atmosphere was nice but I won't be in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  The service was also excellent.  Everybody was very friendly especially Bruno from Napoli."}
{"text":"Great ambience, attentive service and very very good food. They made a special vegetarian risotto for my wife and I had the branzino. The branzino was extremely delicious and worth making a trip again to Tavolo!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my boyfriend for their 2 for 1 pizza night.  We were decided on just getting pizza, and then I looked at the rest of the menu - at that point it was decided we would have a feast.    We started with the Arancini, which were amazing.  So cheesy and the marinara sauce they were served in was just right to bring out the flavour.  Plus, there was lots of sauce, so we were able to dip out bread in the leftover sauce.    We got the Tavolo pizza, and Harvest pizza.  Both were incredible.  My only complaint would be that the crust was a little undercooked.  Not a big deal, as I don't like my pizza crust cooked all the way through anyway.  The meats and cheese complimented each other wonderfully.  And the portion sizes!  My man can pack it back, and he wasn't able to finish off one of the pizzas on his own.    I ordered the Mushroom Risotto.  Again, huge portions.  Very cheesy and lots of mushrooms.  Also not shortage of shredded chicken.  Luckily, I had enough leftover for lunch today.    We didn't have room for dessert we were so full!  Excellent service as well.  My water stayed full, and my man always had a beer.  Food came out quick, and the chef even made a point of coming over to ask us how our feast was.    Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.. atmosphere, service, food all on point. Very good menu with many options for a delicious meal. Pizzas are incredible... Oxtail Cavatelli pasta dish and Hand Pounded Veal Chop all delivered. Brought my kids in today and received phenomenal service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Superb. Amazing decor. Really liked the service and the food. Dessert was delicious. Wine is a bit expensive but most of the menu is reasonable. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Great modern style Italian cuisine. Comfy atmosphere great selection of wines for all kinds of dishes. Friendly open concept and a great escape from those tasteless chain restaurants. Time, flavour and care! Highly recommend this restaurant for a date or a group dinner."}
{"text":"Ordinary food and arrogant service,.... doesn't even deserve the one star that you need to register this review."}
{"text":"Both the service and food were above average. We were a group of 4 people and we love our beer. They have stiegal on tap which was a pleasant surprise. Needless to say, we enjoyed the beers and the appetizers were very good. Calamari and Bruchetta.   The pastas are also quite tasty. Also, there was a mixed type of crowd at this place, including a couple of families with kids. I find that great as this restaurant is welcoming to all genres of people.   Overall, a great experience. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. I've been there twice now and had two very different experiences.   The first was a girls night for three of us. We got the deep fried seafood combo which was pretty good. I then had the pear and cheese pizza which was great. Loved the crust. Cooked perfectly. The waiter brought us fresh bread as well. We split to bottles of wine and had a few drinks at the bar before hand. Bartender was great and made up drinks for us. We had a great time while we waited for our table. We were asked to clear our bar tan before we went to our table. Not an issue. I found the mixed drinks to be about average which is still expensive at $8-$14 each. Not sure what the cost of each item was at dinner, but each of us ended up paying about $80 which I found to be quite costly for what we had. Solid girls night though, so I can't complain.   The second visit solidified I will unlikely be back. I went with a large group, so we had a prix fixe menu that was family style which I did not like at all.   The sizes of the appitizers and food items were not increased to ensure everyone at the table got some of everything. We never received our fresh bread to start and the food took forever to start coming out.   The calamari was good. Not chewy at all, but the dipping wasn't anything special. The charcuterie board wasn't bad. It had procuitto and smoked bacon on it. The truffles ricotta was amazing as was the little garlic donuts. Risotto balls were alright. Nothing out of this world. Their marinara sauce was what made them.   The main dishes is where I have my issues. We had an Alfredo pasta that literally had zero taste. Very disapointing. I was expecting a very creamy, cheesy, garlicky sauce. Nevermind, there was hardly any sauce on it. The rigatoni was equally as disapointing. There was more sauce this time, but the meat in it. It appeared to be some sort of shredded beef. Most people picked it out. It was just awkward. Then there was the margherita pizza. I expected more. Fresh mozerella was not used. It was just your average, basic pizza. I was happy that they used fresh basil though. The fish, straight up, not good. It just tasted like white fish with lemon spread all over it. A few people asked if it was a bland lemon chicken. I make better fish at home.   We had the little donuts with Nutella for dessert. Not bad. Similar to other restaurants.   The cost of the dinner was $475 for 15-20 people plus taxes, gratuity and any drinks. Since more items were added then on the family style menu, I anticipate it was more along the lines of $550. It is significantly cheaper than if each person had paid for their own cheque, but portion sizes and quality lacked.   We had great service from our waiter. He was attentive. Kept out water glasses, wine glasses and mixed drinks full.   The restaurant is beautifully decorated with lots of windows and is clean.   This restaurant confuses me. Some things are well prices such as the pizza and other things are astronomical such as some of the appetizers.   While I really wanted to be able to come to this restaurant again and again, I am not pleased with the inconsistency and do not want to pay those oiexes again to have only an average meal."}
{"text":"It was a sad experience .. service was very good, but somehow the flavours did not come out. We ordered mainly seafood on the menu, but in one case the risotto was overdone and in the other a bit watery. The chef needs to go for a taste test, as similar items in 2 servings were different .. there much restaurants alike."}
{"text":"Very nice place.   great service .    I liked that the management came by and asked questions.  Actually listened.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 and we went here on a Saturday at 5:15.  We all ordered different pizzas.  They were all great.  I would definitely go back.  Server was friendly.  Love the open kitchen!"}
{"text":"It started off great. The restaurant itself is aesthetically pleasing; rustic, open and filled with lots of light. Seemed promising.   We ordered mussels and soup for starters which was delicious -highly recommended, the broth was a delicious tomato base with a spicy kick, the soup was a potato and veggie soup which in our opinion was bland.  The mains were good but not great (Bolognese for myself, Jenny pizza, shrimp pasta and panini -not all for me, at least not this time). Unanimous decision that the food fell short.   With room left over for desert, we ordered the tiramisu and bread pudding. Once again; good but not great.  Overall it fell short. The service was dreadfully slow, the waiter  -thru no fault of his own- had to handle the lunch service by himself and our patience grew very thin towards the end of the lunch. It's a great place but sadly the food and slow -PAINFULLY slow- service force us to pass up on this place in the future. I guess Subway will have to do next time we're here."}
{"text":"Went for family style lunch for 20 people.  Got arachini, antipasto, zucchini, salad, pasta, pizza and dessert.  Everything was delicious.  Especially loved the alfredo bow tie and braised beef cheek pasta.  Pizzas were the thin crust variety with very generous toppings.  Service was top notch.  Would visit to try regular menu or Sunday feast."}
{"text":"WOW!!  WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW !  What an epicurean experience!!!  If you like eating, and, you like Italian food, TAVOLO is a must.  I am so happy to find this place as we don't have to go downtown (Toronto) now for legit Italian food.  Cool ambiance.  Very hip and fresh.  The restaurant was packed.  Glad we made a reso (it was a Saturday night).    Our server (Ragda) was sweet.  She did a great job.  Very attentive, but, only there when we needed her.  She provided some great recommendations, as well.  Try the Jenny pizza.  It's heaven.    Bruno, the Floor Manager - awww Bruno, you're such a sweetheart (this is coming from a guy).  So Italian, bursting with energy, super friendly, and loved to hear us compliment his food.  He's fabulous, and excellent at working the room.  Bruno is a huge part of the experience.  He dropped by our table twice.    I don't hand out 5 stars very often (because it means perfect), and that's what Tavolo is: PERFECT.  See you again soon.  Di ringraziamento ancora per la bella serata"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the decor and the ambience here. I was even happier to know that this place is pretty close to where we live. I thought the Caesar salad was excellent, almost as good as Canyon Creek. The rest of the food was mediocre. They have a great selection of food and great portions! The service was less than ok, definitely nothing to write home about. The staff was friendly but slow for some reason. Still, I would go to this place."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Tavolo.  I went there on Saturday with a large group.  The waitress Sarah was very attentive and personable.  She had us laughing and managed our table very well.  The food was very good, although I found my pizza a little too authentic, I think.  It was a bit too dry for me.  But everything else was really good and everyone loved their meals.  If I were to give them any feedback I would say \"lighting is everything\" and while their decor and lighting is on fleek in the two dining rooms, the bathrooms are a carnival funhouse of scaryness.  The lighting made the mirrors unusable.  All in all a lovely evening was had by all and I will go there again again."}
{"text":"I was super impressed!  I don't eat out often because find most places over priced and I leave hungry with the ridiculous small portions.  I got the: FAMILY FEAST Includes: Antipasto/Salad bar, Choice of Pastas & Pizzas  ADULTS $19.25  A great salad bar with breads, cheeses and deli to start, and a full size pasta meal.  Everything was delicious, the price point was perfect, the location is beautiful and the staff was great.  I would def go back."}
{"text":"We have chosen Tavolo for a family event.  If you are looking for a decent, upscale Italian restaurant, look somewhere else. The only good note was the service  - it was excellent - the two associates that helped us were very professional and patient. The food was average tasting wise and overpriced. The veal marsala was a mix of unseasoned and weird tasting sauce. The branzino was mostly skin - the commestibile part was MIA.  The bad was dealing with management (Jennifer R.) who with her inflexibility, arrogance and poor customer service made the whole experience stressful and unpleasant."}
{"text":"A step down in almost every way (place still looks cool inside) food wise.  My pasta was dull enough that I'd did not finish even though I had skipped lunch. Everyone else's pizza were somewhat undercooked and doughy.   And it took a long time to receive our meals in a, this time, fairly full resto."}
{"text":"Great food. The homemade ricotta and honey is to die for! The gnocchi wasn't as good as we expected but overall they wee great. Good service and very kid friendly. They didn't even blink when my son dropped his entire plate of pasta on the floor."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Oakville.  Located outside Hopedale Mall this restaurant makes some seriously delicious Italian eats.  Incredible house made pasta!  Had the tagliatelle bolognese and it was sublime.  Gnocchi al forno with pancetta and roasted red pepper sauce was fluffy and perfectly seasoned.  We also had the Misto Fritto which was an assorted selection of perfectly fried veggies, cheeses and savoury doughnuts.  WOW!  I cannot say enough good things about this place.  I appreciated that the Bruno the chef worked front of house and really made everyone feel welcome.  This is a place I will happily come back to time and again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service here, my friends are I were very happy.  The chicken Parmesan was absolutely delicious and the portion was very generous. Ambiance is also bright and inviting."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch after my baby  nieces baptism!!! Food was stellar and all staff was very attentive to the needs of all of us ! Good job"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Tavolo this past monday for their 2-for-1 pizza deal.  I mean, two \"gourmet\" pizzas for $17 is a no-brainer if you ask me.  Unfortunately, our experience was hardly as wonderful as other reviewers have indicated.  First off, we felt that our server was a little \"pushy\" when it came to drinks.  We stuck with water at first,  which seemed to annoy him from the get-go.  Every time he came to check on us, he made a point to ask if we wanted a drink, and at one point asked if we had \"picked a wine yet\".  We relented and purchased one glass of their cheapest just to get this guy off our back.  Despite this, other servers who periodically checked on us were pleasant and did not pressure us at all.  For our appetizers, we ordered the Arancini which was in fact delightful.  The risotto filling was smooth and creamy without feeling too unstructured, while the pieces themselves were bronzed to perfection.  Paired with a robust tomato sauce; this dish made for the ideal introduction to the food at Tavolo.    Unfortunately, the pizzas hardly met the bar set by the arancini.  I ordered the 'Tavolo' while my date ordered the 'Jenny'.  The 'Jenny' is a Margherita base with prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmigiana, a pretty standard dish at many gourmet pizzerias.  This pizza was solid, although we hoped for a touch more arugula, this was hardly a deal breaker.  Now for the Tavolo... Oh boy. Topped with house shaved porchetta, bocconcini, smoked provolone, roasted garlic and RAPINI.  Like, a lot of rapini.  You could not take a bite of this pizza without being overwhelmed by the bitter, and earthy taste of rapini.  To make matters worse, when you managed to taste some of the porchetta, you could obviously tell that the meat was far from fresh, and had probably been at the very least 3 days old. I wouldn't call myself particularly picky, but this pizza was close to inedible.   I notified a server of the overwhelming taste of rapini, but she told just to tell them to leave it off next time.  Well, that is if there is a next time.    We ended the night off with a desert that was described as a donut-like pastry with Nutella and a side of vanilla gelato.  It was okay.  The dish was simply deep-fried dough, rolled in sugar, on a bed of Nutella.  I was disappointed but I guess that's what I get for ordering the obvious \"safe-choice\" off the desert menu. Should have gotten the tiramisu.  All in all, Tavolo was a huge disappointment and I can't see myself nor my girlfriend returning to this establishment willingly."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time going and I have to say this will be my last.   The decor yes, is beautiful but that's just as far as it goes as the food was less than mediocre compared to the previous 2 visits that I came a year ago.  Not sure if the chef changed or something due to what I noticed the restaurant was perhaps bought out by one of those big guys (forgot the name but the colourful logo was on the top right of the menus which I don't recall seeing before).  Anyways food wise, we ordered minestrone soup in a cup (which was tiny! I think they got smaller than before), Brussels sprout salad, and gnocchi all of which were a disappointment.  The soup had a bland taste it really had no kick to it and lacked any type of seasoning.  Brussel sprout salad, I really think they should change this name since the salad pretty much looked like bunch of arugula and maybe one or two Brussel sprouts sliced in half were buried in the arugula you could barely find them. The butternut squash were cut in tiny little pieces like baby food and some few raisins here and there. So ya, this should be called Arugula salad if they're gonna go cheap on the main ingredients.  Last but not least, gnocchi. This was a huge disappointment. I recently had the best gnocchi at my brothers Italian wedding and the waiter insisted that theirs were the best...well the gnocchi seemed overcooked and I guess they were left in the water for sometime it was too soft and tasted like Playdough...it needed more sauce and the sauce was tasteless...it was so bland and didn't have much flavour...so we actually had to find the waiter (which took a while since our waiter was not attentive and too busy with other tables ...) to pass us the salt and pepper. :(  In terms of service, I would say between average and less than average considering the last  time we went we actually waited about 50 minutes while seeing all the tables next to us being served. This didn't happen this time around but again the waiter lacked attention and seemed too busy for us.  That is all."}
{"text":"Was always curious about this place as it looks really nice from the exterior and I always pass by since it's in a mall/plaza where my gym is. Had lunch here. Food was ok pretty good, service was ok. Nothing stood out just a really nice restaurant in a weird location."}
