{"text":"First off, my boyfriend and I were excited to try out this restaurant. We went to Montreal last year during Labour day weekend and missed out on our chance of eating here due to time restrictions.

This past weekend, I made sure to make a reservation. Thought I was being smart ... that is, until we cabbed it from our hotel all the way up St.Laurent to be pleased to find a beautiful sign in pure French stating that it was not open - giving no rhyme or reason.

1 star because I have no choice but would love to give them 0 stars. They take down numbers for a reason - to call us. If they had called and left a message stating that they will not be open I would have been fully understanding. This is unacceptable. LUCKILY we found our way south and randomly popped into a nice restaurant called \"Le Comptoir\".

NEVER returning again."}

{"text":"Exquisite dishes are all over the creative, truly first-rate menu. Service was very good, but not particularly memorable. Atmosphere was disappointing--they really need to rethink the lighting in this place... If you only care about having a great meal, you will not be disappointed. If you want it all--great meal and a hip & cool place where you can really experience Montreal's joie de vivre, which is probably what you're looking for in the Mile End to start with--, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner.  The menu here changes often, so I will just say that this place is a foodie's dream.  Fresh, innovative and tasty courses served by informative, polite and courteous staff.  Definitely get the tasting menu, and if it is not available, have them put together a selection.  You won't be disappointed.

It is intimate, so I wouldn't recommend for a large gathering.  But for a special dinner it is perfect.  I would make a reservation in advance, as it was quite busy.  And they have wine."}
{"text":"Voici une très bonne adresse de resto où amener votre chère et tendre moitié pour un moment romantique et gastronomique. Ne prévoyez pas le vin, ils ont déjà une très bonne sélection. Tout ce que vous aurez à faire avant de venir ici c'est réserver (essentiel, surtout les fins de semaine) et vous détendre. La déco est intimiste, le servi excellent et les petits plats dans les grands. Vos papilles en redemanderont! 
A noter si vous y aller pour un midi, ils ont un choix de tapas à petits prix ce qui peut être un bon deal car sinon c'est un peu cher juste pour un repas vite-vite entre midi et 13."}

In classic bistro style, the menu is on a chalk board.  It is divided into 4 sections of small bites, apps, mains, and desserts.  

Started off with a smoked mackerel risotto croquette.  The smokiness interplayed beautifully with the creaminess of the risotto which was inside a perfect crunchy breading.  It was a complex flavour profile which combined nicely with a glass of Anjou chenin blanc.  The hint of smokiness from the wine was the perfect pairing.  

I followed with the fresh goat cheese which was presented on an eggplant pancake on top of an onion compote.  There were some greens to add texture and a slight hint of bitterness.  I was intrigued by the idea of an eggplant pancake, and it did not disappoint.  A lovely dish.  

I also got to taste a bite of a scallop appetizer.  The scallop was nice and fresh, perfectly seared, and presented with a tapenade.  Nice.

For the main I tried the espadon.  It was thinly sliced and baked in a beautiful sauce which had fresh dill, fennel, pearl onions, and a generous amount of butter (of course).  The sauce was perfect for soaking up with the crusty baguette which they frequently replenished.  The sauce was the highlight of the dish.  The fish was cooked nicely, but truly was just a platform for the sauce.  The waiter suggested a Beaujolais, which was a semi-surprising pairing.  But it worked perfectly.  

I also got to try a bite of the pork belly, which had a perfectly crispy skin and was prepared so the meat was quite tender.  Very good.  

For dessert I had the profiteroles which had a very creamy ice cream and were swimming in a chocolate chili sauce.  The perfect end to a truly lovely meal.  

Service was on top of things, made excellent wine pairing suggestions which really worked, and the entire location has a nice lively vibe.  

I do wish we had bistros of this quality in Vancouver!  How about a trade - I'll give you 1 good dim sum restaurant, 25 discount budget sushi places, and a midrange izakaya.  Deal?!?!?!?!?!"}
