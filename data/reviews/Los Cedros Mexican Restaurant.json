{"text":"Ok Yelpers.... you got me again.... Fantastic reviews... so I was very excited to find a new local great mexican restaurant... so after seeing the glowing reviews, I gave it a shot for lunch. Went in about 12:45 and the place was basically empty with the exception of one person ....that should've been a clue once I got there.  The wait staff was really nice and welcoming as others have said. The waitress brought out salsa and chips with bean dip and then noodle soup which was actually pretty good. I ordered the Carne Asada plate for lunch and when it came out it looked pretty good. Unfortunately that's where it stopped the Carne Asada was thicker than normal and was not not well seasoned and was very dry, over cooked and tough. The rice was well seasoned but was hard, it was like it had been sitting for awhile.  Again, I really was looking forward to a new wonderful Mex place, but unfortunately this did not ring the bell for me...."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! Stef was our server and was superb! They give you chips salsa and bean dip to start... then before the meal Stef brought us a tortilla soup that was really good! When we got out entrees we were already sold but they really out did them selves to the point we are rolling out of here...we are so full!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this quaint restaurant as we were driving by.  What a great find!  Beautifully decorated, staff was wonderful, and the food is so good!  Everything is very fresh and homemade.  I had the carne asada tacos with homemade corn tortillas and they were amazing!  I will for sure be going back again!!"}
{"text":"If you want outstanding comfort food Mexican Style, this is the place. The fresh hand made tortilla's are amazing. The shrimp cocktail was a success to everyone in our group ( including the teenager who is a picky eater).  The portion/cost ratio is in your favor as well. If you leave here hungry, it is your fault."}
{"text":"Some of the best mexican food I have ever had! So fresh and such a hole in the wall! Food takes longer then normal because they make everything fresh. I highly recommend this place. We are from California and we will be coming back to this place. Thank you for the best food!"}
{"text":"Loved the hand made tacos!! Husband had the macho nachos and they are HUGE!! Loved the service too. Super friendly funny waitress."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to drop in for lunch. The atmosphere was inviting and our Server, Jesse was awesome. We ordered the Fajitas for two and were treated with a house specialty soup that was surprisingly good. Would recommend this place to anyone in the area. Looking for authenticity and great food, this is the place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. First, the Micheladas are great.   Had one with Pacifico.  It was a bit on the spicy side so make sure you ask for not-to-spicy if you can't handle it.   It was delicious.   The torta was very good too.  Bread was fresh.     I had the mole enchiladas.  Excellent.   A bit spicy but the sour cream helped.  Very authentic.   Overall everything was fresh and excellent.  It did take a while to get food but not too bad and we were not in a hurry.   The place was a bit empty but I don't think it will remain that way as people try their food and Micheladas.   By the way, came back and had an horchata.  It was excellent.  The pupusas were very good too."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find!! Los Cedros Mexican Restaurant is absolutely delicious!  I have been twice in six days. The staff are so friendly. Jessie (female) was extremely helpful and attentive. She made our eating experience fabulous! The bean dip and salsa are very tasty.   The complimentary soup is quite the bonus (more restaurants need to do this).  Their tortilla chips are nice and crunchy- not at all like some Mexican restaurants where they're thin and greasy.  The sizzling chicken and shrimp fajitas are on point and a Dos Equis ambar tops the whole meal off to total perfection.  If you're craving Mexican food, get to this place immediately!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant only has 5 stars,  I thought it was the worst Mexican food I've had in awhile. Nobody there but us,  friendly waitress.  Asked For a margarita on ice and asked for top shelf,  they said they only had one type of tequilaand I got a blended one in which i couldn't taste alcohol. We shared a two-person steak fajita and were greatly disappointed. Never have I had fajitas not sizzling when arriving to the table,  but these had a 1/4 inch puddle of oil on the bottom and were silent.  Got the MOST basic beans/rice (which were cold), no guac or pico de gallo. The whole thing was severely underwhelming... lack of flavor!!"}
{"text":"Server was amazing always had a joke and a smile on her face. The cooks were awesome I asked to modify a plate in which no other restaurant would ever do for me and they allowed it. Kind of a hard place to find I missed it when trying to find it. Very cool experience will be back and would recommend trying it out. Don't pass it up next time your out slide thru."}
{"text":"My granddaughter and I ate at this restaurant. I found it on yelp and because of the wonderful reviews we decided to try it and we were very happy! It's a family owned and operated, the food is freshly prepared upon your order and the service was friendly and warm and we look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great new spot!  My husband and I came in here looking for the burger lab, but instead stayed to try this new place. The service, the food, the overall experience was awesome! The micheladas are even better than the last place! We enjoyed everything! You definitely get what you payed for!"}
