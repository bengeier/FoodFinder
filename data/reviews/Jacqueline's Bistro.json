{"text":"Good home cooked meals here and a surprisingly large number of tables.   Looking for something trendy or super original?  Skip this bistro, it's not what they're trying to be...and they know it.  But I would go back again because of  simple vibe.  Feels like the place is open because they love it, not to cash in.  Felt like a bunch of friends working there enjoying running a small neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Neat local restaurant in SE Calgary. Not very large. 50 people max. Open kitchen.   Staff is friendly but not very efficient in taking food order.   First experience the service got slower as the evening progress.   Food decently priced and portion well."}
{"text":"Jacqueline's Bistro is a beautifully decorated restaurant with a very promising menu. However, the food was just mediocre. We were there on date night, and the price is great for an appy, 2 entrees and a dessert (50$) but I would have rather spent that money and a local pub. I had the seafood salad which had imitation crab in it, and the pork tenderloin was just a little bit better than average. I would probably not go back, just because the price was a little too steep for me.  Also, the restaurant felt understaffed, while the service was OK it was quite a wait for the food."}
