{"text":"My friend and I have been trying out some of the places on hotwings.ca and so far I have been most impresed with the Black Sheep and Loco Lou's.  Both serve good sized wings and their flavours are good.  Not a huge fan of super hot wings so we always try out salt and pepper, bbq and such.  The Black Sheep is one of the highest rated places on hotwings.ca for good reason, its a cozy place to watch a game (get there early if you do) and not brutally loud that you can't talk to your friends.  Wing nights are only on Wed though."}
{"text":"I went just for wings cause I heard they were the best in Calgary.  Wings night was Monday and Wednesday for 25 cents each.  They had a lot of flavors but I think Honey Garlic and the Rickards BBQ are the best ones there.  I was so excited for the Spicy Parmesan but when we got the order, it was just hot wings sprinkled with Parmesan on top, REALLY LITTLE PARMESAN.  Jerk and Cajan were really strong but dry and had no taste. Death Valley was... death valley, but I didn't like how the spice tasted, but if you like the burning feeling, this is great.  Lemon pepper and Salt & Pepper aren't that great, they're really dry, but well seasoned.    The wing sizes are really big, even for wings night.  Obviously, for wings night, it's no refills for drinks and everyone at the table have to order something or else there's still a charge.  We also had the fries and the beef dip.  The fries were normal, but the beef dip was...pretty bad.. the beef inside was not tear able.  When I say terrible, I mean I couldn't bite through it.  I would go back, but only for the wings.  So when I'm rating this pub, I'm rating just for the wings.  Price Wise (1 being cheap, 5 being expensive):  3/5 Food Quality (1 being not worth it, 5 being totally worth it): 3/5 Service Wise (1 being horrible, 5 being amazing): 3/5"}

{"text":"Still closed as the black sheep, years now  New name is horny toad  Same bad food and service I am afraid  Not sure why it has not been changed on yelp"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for wings and it was great. Very busy in there but our service was still very good. Wings were nice and plump and they had alot of  flavours. Half price drinks until 8 was pretty nice too! Wish they had more beers on tap though."}
{"text":"First off, I would be really pleased if they would drop the 'West Coast' part of the name, since they aren't located on the west coast.  It just doesn't seem to make sense, but that's just me.  :)  Even with the name, I do enjoy Black Sheep.  People aren't wrong when they say that this place has some pretty damn good wings!  I don't know what makes them so darn delicious, but they sure hit the spot when you're after some good ol' wings.  Food aside, I really enjoy the atmosphere in this place.  It's got a nice vibe to it that makes it feel welcoming and comforting.  I also really enjoy the music.  They have a band play there from time-to-time called Moment and Monuments who I really enjoy.  They are a local band, but pretty decent.  Black Sheep often has some pretty good drink and food specials, as well, which makes it a cheaper place to party.  The servers are always super nice and aren't afraid to joke around with their tables.  I really enjoy Black Sheep West Coast pub, even if it isn't on the west coast.  It's a good time all around!"}
