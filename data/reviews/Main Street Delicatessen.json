{"text":"Doesn't look like much on the inside, and there seemed to be only one guy working.   How can you run a restaurant with one guy?  From reading some other reviews, it seems the big issue with this place is the amount of time it takes to get one's food.  In fact, I ate here in August '11 when they were in a different location in the same complex and had the same issue.  Food just took too long to come out.  

Today, and to the cook's credit, my sandwich came out quickly.  I got the Balboa sandwich, which was killer!!!  The bread was great, the fries were hot and crisp, and the veggies, cheese, and roast beef were delicious.  I'd add a star if they spruced the place up a bit.  It looks so run-down inside, which is strange because it hasn't been there very long."}
{"text":"I ordered the 16\" 1-topping pizza, was good and price was right. Food was good and a variety on the menu. The food was not too slow when I was there however when I went I was the only customer.  The place is small but cozy, and was not filthy but a little dirty. They do have a grading of A so I was okay, and only 1 person there, so he can only do 1 thing at a time. I will return and it was only 3 miles from my house. I am in the country so that's good! My son is a picky eater, he is autistic and he loved the food. So did I and very reasonable prices, but will do a call in order next time."}
{"text":"The food was delicious once we got it.  The wait was forever and it seems like they could use at least one more person working there on a Saturday at lunch time.  There were 3 tables not cleared of old dishes so we had to stand most of the time we waited.  The place could use a good cleaning, which is a shame because the food was very good whic is the only reason I'm giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food is really good, but it takes FOREVER to get your order. There is very little if any service from the employees. It took litterally 25 minutes for a reuben sandwich. Not planning on coming back."}
{"text":"We popped into the Main St. Delicatessen for a quick dinner tonight. 

The staff was super friendly and very helpful. They pointed us toward their Pizza special, $5.00 for a 14\" one topping pizza.  This was no $5 Little Caesars crappy pizza, it was authentic NY Style Pizza !! It was one of the best we have had in the Charlotte area. 

We can't wait to come back and try their overstuffed Deli Sandwiches next."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this restaurant based on it being in the community that we live in plus previous Yelp reviews.  The food was very good.  Although I am giving it only a four star rating, we look forward to go back to try other things on the menu - especially the pizza.  We were prepared to wait for a meal based on previous reviews - it did not take very long for our meal to come out.  The one staff person was able to multitask, taking phone orders, preparing food and handling take out orders.  We had great conversation with the person working about the business.

I would agree that some work could be done in the dining area, but other than that, the food was very good and the one person working was great!

Okay had the pizza tonight - I would not recommend the pizza. I don't know which is worst NYPD or this pizza. Too much cornmeal, three toppings (not sure where they put them) and salty.  I had to change my rating to three stars this pizza is so bad!  Don't believe the other reviews about them having good pizza unless you hate your taste buds. Mine just beat me in the mouth for abusing them.  Toppers best so far, although Tony's is good but very greasy."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite spot!  My favorite menu item is the Instant Attack sandwich! There isn't a deli in Charlotte, Concord or Harrisburg that can compete with their sandwiches! Simply awesome.  My husband loves the New York style pizzas, especially the meat lovers!  The kids love the pizza as well as the chicken and waffles!  Their brownie bottom cakes are awesome!  We eat here at least once a week!  Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"These guys are great!  My business (Sports Junction) is right down the street so I occasionally walk over for lunch.  Haven't found one thing yet I don't like and they are always friendly and willing to do what they can.  Homemade chips are excellent and they have top-notch deli sandwiches.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Takes 1 hour plus to make you a deli sandwich and that could care less. Not to mention the hair in my sub. Stay away!"}
{"text":"All im gonna say is that if a place can make a good Italian sub it means everything else is just as good!! And the homemade chips are amazing!!"}
