{"text":"Enjoyed the environment very much. All draught beers are $5 during games (it was a raptors game, not sure about others). Fries looked hand cut which was great!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty but incredibly small. I paid over $15 for two tiny, tiny sliders. Ridiculously small. The service is ok but I will not be returning due to small good portion. I give this place 8 months tops before they are forced to shut down."}
{"text":"Interesting experience, went there with a $65 coupon. Convenient location, we got a nice booth with street view. However, dont think ill come again, esp when paying with the menu price. Two of us ordered:

Ceasar salad - UNCUT vegie with ceasar salad dressing spread on top, the vegie at the bottom has no taste at all. Felt like a goat eatting grass....

Wings - 6 tiny wings with thai fused dressing.

Pork belly taco - two tacos with a kick in it, however, taco was store bought and cold.

Pasta - lots of pesto, fresh made pasta as the waitress kept insisting. Has a good bite to it.

Steak friz - nothing special. Kudo on home made fries

Sliders - two tiny burgers with some fries... saw an pineapple like ingredient, but turn out it was a slice of potato.. slice of potato in a bun...

Tiramisu - whip cream, finger biscuit, choco flakes and lemon zest... felt like no effort was put in..."}
{"text":"had a groupon with us and were met by a friendly staff member who said that it was a new menu.....and at first sight, it looked good...we ordered garlic bread and onion rings as starters and a hamburger and chicken wings as mains...everything arrived at the same time...but the onion rings were no where to be seen until the waitress told us that they were hidden under the chicken wings, and indeed they were, but they were extremely greasy characteristic of breading that was cooked in low temp oil...the hamburger came with mushrooms, cheese and bacon and was drippingly greasy...the garlic bread was the winner.....we usually go back and give it a second try but in this case, i think we'll pass...it's a case of a good menu but poor execution..."}
{"text":"We have a groupon worth 90 dollars value for this place... tried to make rsvp 2 weeks ago when the server told us only if we can come before 5pm because the chef is closing the kitchen due to the fact there were no customers all day (bad sign)..so we tried again today, called ahead and arrived for a late lunch around 2. There were no customers inside the restaurant when we arrived..and it was cold...(maybe trying to save heat because there were no customers?). We were seated promptly with our choice of seating by the window.. ordered 10 dishes from their tapas like menu including pork belly tacos (super spicy, on the dry side), skirt steak fritz (steak under seasoned but friees were good, hand cut style), sliders (underseasoned and on dry side), wings (small fried wings with a scallion kimchi style slaw.. wasnt bad... i liked this dish), fish and chips (nice big piece of fish, fresh tasting and good fries), asian eggplant bruschetta (so spicy i couldnt finish my piece), mandoo (a pork dumpling with a cream and pureed beet sauce), springs rolls (as expected, crispy but not the best ive ever had at 9 bucks, id rather spend 3 for vietnamese springrolls!).
interestingly, i read fellow yelper vincent b's review after our experience and realized we had the same experience! The server was attentive and food came quick..but they sort of stopped coming around when we were ready to leave... we had to go up to the bar to ask for the bill. And im also pretty sure we overpaid... i had no idea how their billing system works.. i calculated ahead of time how much i was spending minus the groupon and it did not make sense... there was an extra 11.70 tacked on at the end for no reason... i know i should have asked for clarification but we were freezing and also kind of felt bad for their establishment... gave them 15pct tip on the total rather than the 20 on original...seems over charging and mischarging is normal here? I would not come back here."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place after work on a Friday. The restaurant was mostly empty for the entirety of the time we were there, and it was quite cold by the windows (we needed to change seating due to this). The price point seemed reasonable until the actual food started arriving - other reviewers have commented on the value, and they were not exaggerating. The bruschetta was four tiny pieces, each about the size of a loonie, the tacos were two small 4 inch taco rounds, the dumplings, four small dumplings. This really is a 'cafe' type place, formica type booths, generic recessed lighting in the ceiling, cheap drink specials, so the price and sizing of the plates seemed so off-key, priced as though this were a higher end restaurant experience. It was tasty, but I doubt we'll return, as there are a boatload of restaurants with equally delicious plates of a better size and value within walking distance. The service was okay (we had problems getting our bill at the end) and the drinks were cheap."}
{"text":"I dined here with my sister last night with a $20 Groupon good for $40 worth of food. I made a reservation, like it said on the Groupon, for 5pm. We got there right at 5 since we both work in the area. We were greeted and seated right away in a booth with a nice view, facing the window. I think it's a great location and I like the set up of the restaurant, but it is kind of hidden just off Yonge St.. We were the only people dining at this time, on this particular Wednesday night and we received excellent service during our time here.

Our server explained the concept of the restaurant as Tappas style small meals with an Asian-Italian fusion. She also noted that everything is fresh and prepared in house and that they had no fish & chips.  

It happened to be $5 Martini night so we each got a Lychee Martini to start off our micromeals. Then we ordered the Mandoo, the Arancini, Pork Belly Tacos, and Sliders. We got the tacos first and were warned about the hot pepper that was in it. I love spicy so I thought these were really good! Next came the Mandoo on a sizzling hot plate. These were good and different from any other dumpling I have had before. The dough wrapped around the filling was a bit thicker and harder than I am used to. Next was the Arancini which is the Chef's creation when you order them so ours were miso filled and topped with marinara sauce. I have to say this was the most interesting flavour combination we tried and it did work for us. Lastly, the sliders were really enjoyable and juicy. I really liked the aioli and pickled vegetable on it. Also as others have mentioned the home made fries were really good. You could taste how fresh and real they were. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I wouldn't mind going back again sometime. Maybe with a another Groupon or try the All You Can Eat option for $25.95."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the decor isn't the best - and because I'm a snob I refused to visit this restaurant for a really long time due to its location. However, I finally went today and the food is really, really great. I am replacing this place with the Guu on Church, which has disappointed me recently.  
The food here is eclectic, fresh and really delicious. 
Did I mention they have a great selection of beer from Amsterdam brewery? It's amazing. I hope more people start frequenting this place, because it's not to be missed."}
{"text":"Wow! Every dish that I had was DELICIOUS. From the Thai mango salad to the pork tacos mmmmm. The ambience was nice. The waitress was great, so friendly and accommodating. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Located across from Wellesley Station (a little out-of-sight when walking on Yonge), this restaurant is an establishment on the upstairs floor of their building. 

First impression: walked in facing the toilets, which was odd. I then turned the corner to find a flight of stairs leading up and when I made it to the top, the restaurant itself wasn't too shabby. Very much like a sports bar, there were multiple televisions stationed around the perimeter and the interior was mostly predominated by comfy seating booths. With lighting that was a bit dimmed, the ambiance of the restaurant was overall quite nice and laid back. 

NOW, HERE'S SOMETHING I MUST BRING UP IMMEDIATELY: all was well until the unspeakable happened. As we were waiting for the food to arrive, I went to take a sip of my water and I saw an alive, but struggling ant on my napkin... Yep. Of all things you don't want to see in a restaurant, number 1 would be insects. So after this, I was a little sketched out and uneasy about the cleanliness of the restaurant. 
 
As for food, we ordered 3 entrees and 1 dessert.
Chicken wings ($6) = very small wings but reflective of its cheaper price and were decent. The random \"onion slaw\" that they put on top though?? Unnecessary and unappetizing. 
Sliders ($12) = although I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of ingredients used in the burger (gouda cheese and pickled vegetables were yummy), the execution could use A LOT of work. The buns were hard, cold, and a little stale. They were also quite petite and the order only came with 2. Fries will be discussed below.
Skirt steak fritz ($10) = the steak itself wasn't bad - it was cooked to medium and thinly sliced. The fries, however, were pretty bad. Overly crisp, dry, and COLD, the fries were hugely disappointing. There was no consistency in the thickness of the fries and they were heavily salted - so much so that I had to scrape the salt off each fry individually with my knife. 
Overall comment = likely because they held the dishes to serve them at once, EVERYTHING came cold, which was very unfortunate. That definitely diminished the quality of the food. 

Lemon tiramisu ($6) = in itself, not too bad. Strong coffee-flavoured lady fingers submerged in one unison layer of cream, sprinkled with chocolate shavings and candied orange/lemon rind. The tiramisu itself was decent, but the supposed \"lemon\" aspect of it did NOTHING. No citrus flavour whatsoever aside from the rind and even then, it was coated so thoroughly with sugar that I still couldn't really taste it. I also disliked how there were added pinches of sugar atop the tiramisu. Unnecessary and unappreciated.  

Service was great though. Friendly and chatty employee. 

Would not come back."}
{"text":"The taps seem to be running dry here as of lately. However, i don't mind the tall boy cans. My philly cheese steak sandwich was just okay. There was nothing special about it."}
{"text":"I bid on and won a gift certificate to this restaurant from the YMCA's silent auction. I would have been happier to have just donated the money to the Y and not have come to this place for dinner, it was THAT bad. Have you ever said that before?

The food was either too salty, extremely bland or so spicy that I could not eat it.
I didn't eat their caesar salad because it was limp, soggy and had inedibly hard pieces of pork on top. Their margarita drink special was lacking flavour (except too much salt). I sent back the thai salad because it was inedible from salt. When they asked if I wanted another item to replace it, their food was so bad I actually said no. I literally didn't want anything else from the menu, even though it was comped, because I just wanted to leave. I don't think I've ever refused a replacement item before so this should say enough. Their pork tacos was drenched in an extremely spicy sauce as well. Why? I'm from the Caribbean so I know my spice and this was just mouth burningly hot and wasn't tasty at all. I just left it and didn't even bother to complain about this to the waiter because again, I just wanted to leave. 

This might be the worst restaurant I've been to in all of my Yelping career.... which is a shame because the server was very nice and the restaurant itself has a lot of potential (location, bar). They are just trying so hard to be everything (see the sign when you enter yourself, it's a healthy eating place, bar, restaurant, cafe, etc. etc. etc.) and in the process, they aren't anything at all. From a menu that swings from Japanese ramen, to Italian pasta, Korean mandoo and Chinese spring rolls, this place doesn't find its mark ANYWHERE. Save your money, dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Microtime for dinner on their first day of opening and boy I was impressed with the decor, service and food. The foods were delicious and exceeded my expectation. They were simple, fresh and delicious. 

My favourite was the seafood mix. The calamari fries and coconut shrimps served with lemon garlic aioli and chilli plum sauce were so damn good! The sauces complimented the shrimp and calamari perfectly. I'd rate this dish a 10/10! 

As for dessert, I had the lemon tiramisu. It was house made and recommended by one of the managers/owners. The tiramisu was an OMG. I was a little disappointed that it's called \"lemon tiramisu\" because I can hardly taste any lemon in it but it was still a good-solid-rich-and-creamy-but-light-at-the-same-time tiramisu. I ate the cream on its own and it was too much for me but when I ate everything together, it was yum! I'd rate it 9/10. 

I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back for more! Keep up the good work Microtime Cafe!"}
{"text":"Well, I am impressed. I've been to this restaurant twice now and I am loving it. Finally a decent patio in such a prime location! 

First of all I want to discuss the food. It's tapas, which I love. And it's delicious. They know what they're doing. The shrimp are delicious, the Asian Bruschetta is divine! What's also amazing is the Skirt Steak frites. That is a must to order. Done just perfectly, tender and marinated in this tasty tangy sauce. The mango salad does not disappoint either. 

The staff are so friendly and professional. They are well versed in the menu and will answer any questions you have. They are eager to please and just so fun with zero attitude. I walk past the restaurant often and they always smile and say hello. So refreshing.

Please check out this restaurant. Church and Wellesley need this place. The patio is so needed here on this Wellesley strip. It's not completely finished yet, as cooler weather is approaching, but they have a lot of plans for next summer. But sitting out there last night with great music playing, great wine list and fresh homemade food made for a splendid evening all around. 

Cheers Micro Time!"}
{"text":"It was my second dinner in the Microtime cafe! Every food was delicious! Their food and service impressed me. 
My favorite dishes are Angus beef sliders and pork Taco! Their drinks were amazing too~ It's really good place for hanging out with frds."}
{"text":"Food was very good and service was amazing.  Price was reasonable and ambiance was really good.  The basketball game was on so it kept me entertained.  I would definitely come back after the mouth watering food we had! Please keep in mind this is tapas bar so food portions are very small."}
{"text":"We ordered a whole bunch of \"micro meals\" (basically tapes) and they were all unique and delicious .  Especially the pork belly tacos and the sliders.   Everything was unlike anything I have had before and was a neat, tasty (usually Korean inspired) spin on some classic bar food you have seen before (wings, sliders, tacos, spring rolls, fish and chips etc.) drinks were good also, they made a great Margarita (on a daily special for $5) and have a few Amsterdam beers on tap.  

Service was great, although unfortunately there wasn't many guests there... There have been a few different restaurants in this location over the last few years and they have never made it.  I hope this one does because it is really a gem.  

Check it out, you won't be disappointed, and definitely need to try the pork belly tacos!"}
{"text":"Myself and a friend came here for dinner after work & we wanted to spend her Groupon. Great location & easy to find (opposite Wellesley Station).

My friend made a reservation (as stated on the Groupon), we were greeted by a lovely friendly server who told us we could sit anywhere (we chose a booth with a nice view facing the main street).

As it was both our first time, the server explained the concept of the Tapas style but not as small and she pointed out everything was freshly made to order (ideal)!!

As we came on a Thursday, it was $5 wine night...I had a nice sweet White wine (it was to die for), my friend did not drink.

We ordered four dishes to share between us (hot wings, a mushroom & pesto dish, spring rolls & a pasta dish)

Everything tasted fresh & flavorful. We did not like the pasta dish so much (I must get the name of the dish).

Overall, it was a nice dining experience and I would go back with another Groupon if i had the chance."}
{"text":"I am so glad that they finally shut down biryani house... That place was an embarrassment. Microtime cafe is a welcome change in my opinion. Have been here a couple of times since it opened and I don't think I have any major complaints. I like how they have a large variety of dishes as tapas (skimpy albeit for sharing and a bit pricy for some of the portion), but I love nibbling when drinking and this allows me to try a bunch of different things."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a voucher to try this place out. It has a prime location just across from the Wellesley TTC station, in the old Biryani House / Spice Village restaurant. Patio season is long over; so we went upstairs to the large bar/restaurant area. They had decorated the downstairs very festively for Halloween.

We arrived at 11:30am for an early lunch. When we were seated, the waitress told us we could only order from the breakfast menu until noon, when the lunch menu would begin. We were both stunned. Bear in mind that at this time of day, the restaurant was completely empty. And on a business day, 11:30am is a perfectly acceptable lunchtime particularly for take-out and delivery. I would have expected them to invite us to order drinks, maybe sit us down with menus, and hurry along the chef to expedite the process - but the waitress just stood firm. We were in no mood for breakfast, or this lack of flexibility.

Without a voucher, I would have just walked out and never come back. But we had a short errand to run in the area anyway; so we told them we would be back at noon. On the way out the manager stopped us and asked if anything was the matter. We said we wanted lunch, not breakfast. He said ok and let us leave, making no attempt as above. When we returned at noon, there were maybe 2 tables occupied besides ours - still deathly quiet.

They have good drink specials; so I ordered a $4 Caesar. It was nice and spicy and decently strong, but I did not like the look of the rimmed glass or the lemon and lime wedges. They looked like they had sitting around for a while.

Lunch specials come with choice of soup of the day or salad, plus a soft drink. We both ordered the pumpkin soup. It was a fairly sweet puree, but there was a nice use of coconut milk. My friend found it too thick, but I thought it was just right. We both agreed it could have used more spice, like curry or hot chili.

I ordered the salmon entree ($13), following the waitress' recommendation that the salmon is very fresh, never frozen. It was the one bright spot of the entire meal: a decent-sized filet pan-fried to a perfect medium-rare and well-seasoned. It was served on a mound of avocado puree, along with grilled king oyster mushroom slices and 3 grilled asparagus spears. This was a good dish.

My friend ordered the spaghetti aglio e olio (w/ garlic & oil - $11), and it was very disappointing. There was hardly any oil at all, so little that when she tried to twirl the pasta, her fork lifted the entire block of noodles off the plate. There was a scant amount of spinach, but a mound of black olives and sun-dried tomatoes - it resembled puttanesca more than anything. The grano padano shavings on top looked very, very dry - as if shaved well in advance and dried out in the fridge. Our guess is that this dish was prepared in advance and microwaved. This was a complete flop.

For dessert (which took a disproportionately long time to arrive) I had the nutella parfait, and my friend had the lemon tiramisu ($6 each). Both were essentially Dream Whip-type mousses with a few toppings. Let's put it this way. Have you ever tried tiramisu from one of those Chinatown bakeries that sells 6 sweet buns for $6?  This is the level of what you are getting here.  The nutella parfait was garnished with crushed peanuts and Skor Bar chunks. The tiramisu is a misnomer - this was a lemon-less mousse (again, Dream Whip or some equivalent - none of the texture that real cream or mascarpone gives) topped with crushed lady fingers and candied lemon peel.  These were utter failures in both concept and execution. Awful.

One problem worth noting is that throughout the meal we were bothered by fruit flies. You know what that means - typically, an accumulation of trash or old stock somewhere. The place looked ok to the naked eye. Neither of us used their washroom facilities.

Service was very uneven throughout, even barring the initial lack of flexibility. Our waitress was very attentive at the onset, asking us if everything was ok at every stage. Later on, she was much less visible, and she never seemed to pick up on when we were done with dishes or menus. There also looked to be a miscalculation on the bill (I am pretty sure we overpaid by at least $5), but we could not be bothered to sort it out. We just wanted out of there.

I rarely give such a harsh review, but I expect more effort from a new business to gain customers. I hope this place does better with its tapas menu, because the neighbourhood could use a nice, reasonably priced place. The venue is huge, and I have a hard time believing it will survive until next patio season. There is potential here, but with all these problems we will not be returning to see if it is ever realized."}
