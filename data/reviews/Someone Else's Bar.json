{"text":"Worst place I have ever been. Got condescended by the bartender as she asked me \"do you see the clientele that comes here?\" Overall it looks like a dive bar to me and then the disrespect from a bartender. I'm paying clientele as everyone else. Then when asking to speak with a manager she clearly told me I should just leave. Will never recommend and overall service was ridiculous. I'm astonished by the way I was treated I wish for no one else to ever feel this way."}
{"text":"Great homemade food! Great service! The owner is super nice and knows what she is doing. Keep up the great work! The patio out back is perfect to sit out on a nice evening. Candy, candy everywhere!"}
{"text":"This place serves up great bar food that's a step above their competition. The service is friendly. Between the candy on the table and all the soaps in the bathroom, this place has its own twist on a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to a Else's for a year and a half. It is by far one of the most welcoming places we've ever been. The staff is amazing. Not only remembering names, but also food and drink orders. My husband is a big beer drinker and their revolving tap, beer of the month, and seasonal beers are right up his alley. The food is always on par. I have never had a meal that I didn't enjoy. Their wing flavors are amazing and their burgers are to die for.  Perfect size restaurant and bar, we are so very  lucky to have this gem in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time a few weeks ago, even though it's right down the street and I pass it fairly often. They have a very cute outdoor area in the back, with comfy chairs that have lollipops behind them! There are also large chalkboard walls, which can be quite entertaining after a few drinks. We didn't eat anything, but don't worry, we plan to this Thursday (I will report back then). I heard they have some pretty good buff chicken quesadillas! But I have to agree with everyone else, this place is quite corky, and a South Hills gem. The bartender did remember everyone's name, and was extremely friendly. Not the place to go to if you're looking to get wild though. They do a good job of keeping everyone in check."}
{"text":"Our favorite bar in the South Hills. Friendly staff who get to know you, free candy at every seat and GREAT food and drink. Cozy atmosphere. Worth our 20 minute drive, every time."}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant with a bar in the front and tables throughout!  Very friendly staff and truly great food."}
{"text":"I truely love this place! I call it Elsie's Place. So welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. Great brews and food. Wonderful service. Thebar area is most defintely is the place to be. That's where the fun starts be it watching a game, or just small talk. Elsa & Kathy , and staff will see to it that you will be treated like family."}
{"text":"Great service! I felt like a regular on my first visit. My burger was really above average. The homemade chip where killer. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love Someone Else's bar! Mexican Mondays!! Also the sweet potato fries are great!"}
{"text":"Not your typical neighborhood bar.  Candy on the bar and tables.  Clean restrooms with an array of scented soaps; kids will want to wash their hands before eating just to sample the soaps.  Good service and friendly atmosphere.  Although the menu is typical bar food, it is better than average.  A nice local restaurant that is consistently good.  Seating is limited and there is no waiting area so going during busy times can be a little frustrating."}
{"text":"Went there one time with a friend of mine late on a Saturday night.  Had tables and a bar in the middle.  Had a penguins game on.  A group of 5 professional type women, older couples watching sports, and a family eating.  We got a table and I got a burger with homemade chips, my friend got a wrap and fries.  Prices and portions are fair.  You get free candy at the table, jars of twizzlers and other stuff.  We each had two drafts, I can't remember what or the price.  Little single mens room at end of hall, not a big place.  Your choice of 4 scented anti-bacterial soaps.  Didn't seem like a place to meet women, but food and drinks would make me go back, pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Best homemade chicken tenders ever! The folks here are always super friendly and you can't beat all the candy everywhere! I also love that there are toys for the kids to play with in the back room. Oh, and did I mention that the bathroom has 15 soaps to choose from!? Seriously, if you don't come back to the table don't know why. You're still figuring out which one to use. This is always a hit whether or not there are two of us or 20 of us. Only reason it's not getting a five star? Just may be a bit spendy for barfood. That said, it's great food! So maybe I shouldn't be complaining."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. I am not a fan of tall bar stools so my friend and I sat in the back with the gumballs and kids. It was fun! I got a veggie quesadilla that really surprised me. It was so much better than I expected! Wonderful staff, really sweet people. Already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I'm usually one to give 5 stars to everything but this place has disappointment me big time, twice!  We had been going there regularly for about a year because the food is good and we decided to bring a group there for my husband's birthday.  The owner could not have been more rude about everything.  She seemed irritated that we came at all and any time we asked for another drink or a menu, she rolled her eyes and walked away grumbling.  That night ended horribly with her being rude, charging me for bringing my own cupcakes, and then yelling at us for playing with the balloons at the table.  There was barely anyone in the bar so we thought she would enjoy the business but she pretty much yelled at us for being there and shoved us out.  We vowed to never go back but...  One night we decided to get take out.  I walked in to pick it up and stood at the bar for a while waiting for someone to ask me what I needed an no one even glanced in my direction.  The bartender stood at the other end chatting away, the owner kept looking at me but continued to sit at the bar talking to the bartender.  She eventually got up, asked what I wanted, then made someone else get my food.  The good food can't save this place with the rude service."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant has a festive feel to it the minute you walk in, coupled with fresh-made homemade everything so that you can't help but give it a 5.  Service, you ask?  Friendly beyond belief, courteous, and smart. To boot, my friend and I are City dwellers, Northside, and took the train out to the Burbs to check out...will go again!!  We had chili-fries, the Flying Dutchman burger (best potato pancake in the Burgh), and some wings.  All delish'."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am very, very pleased to have \"found\" this place in the South Hills. I discovered it when I was grabbing lunch next door at the Kabob G Grill and thought that I have to stop in and check it out after researching via Yelp and the business' website.  I came into this place around 7:30 on a cold and blustery Saturday night . Upon entering I felt like I had entered a jolly old pub one might see in a movie and think I wish I could find something like that. This place was warm and welcoming from the decor, staff, and patrons.   The special lady and sat at the bar and had a beverage each, I have to admit I'm not sure how much the beers we had were but we had three for a total of $18. While I like Great Lakes beers and the wife had a macrobrew, I still think that an avg.of $6 a beer was a little steep but not ridiculous. They did have a very general variety on draft, but unfortunately no hoppier beers for us hopheads.   We tried some ginger sesame wings or something along those line they were solid, and the fish sandwich was enormous and tasty. You can order this piece of ?? Haddock or cod??? you know one of those typical hunks of fish grilled or fried, we decided to get it fried and it was done perfectly, the fish was hot and flaky, and the breading nice and crispy.   My lady really enjoyed the assortment of scented soaps in the bathrooms and I just felt like I was at home thinking to myself why the heck do my hands smell like spiced -vanilla- hoisin berry- fruitcake. I would recommend splitting the fish because it is huge. I will certainly be coming back here for the food and atmosphere and maybe a beverage. Oh and ample free parking is a major plus."}
{"text":"We love the food at Someone Else's bar, and the people are very nice.  However, the time it takes to get your food has become unbearable.  They are always packed, but must not have enough people working there to accommodate the crowd.  We took my father in law there a few months back for dinner while he was visiting.  On that visit we waited probably an hour to get our food.  Today my wife and I wanted a quick dinner on the way home from work.  I called and ordered 1 chicken salad (with no onion or mushroom) and 1 steak salad.  The lady told me it would be 25 to 30 minutes, which I thought was already pretty long for 2 to go salads but whatever. Got there with about 5 minutes to spare.  Paid for the food, and waited...and waited...finally after I sat at the bar for about 40 minutes (so it's now been an hour) my food came.  Got it home to find that the meat on the salads was cold, steak was over done a little, and my wife's chicken salad was covered in onions and mushrooms.  Sadly I don't think we'll be back.  Which is a shame because I really do like thileir food, and love supporting local businesses.  I only gave 2 stars because the food is pretty good usually."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great energy in the bar. A welcoming place. There's candy on the table and good food on the menu."}
{"text":"Happened by this bar because we took the wrong T line. Such a great place! Super friendly staff, good beers on tap, m&m candy at the bar and tables -  we didn't order food, but what we saw others' ordering looked delicious! I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place very kid friendly free candy an outside deck with chalk and bubbles awesome bartenders and and waitresses love the apps chicken tidbits are my fave I am so going back there love it"}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe anyone gave this place a one star but I guess everyone has a bad day. We were immediately greeted as was every person that walked thru the door while we were there.  The people were super friendly.  The food was good and the menu and beer selection had something for every taste.  The atmosphere was cutesy skulls, real roses and candy.  The woman's room was very nicely decorated, clean and had at least 10 different bed and bath soaps to choose from.  We will definitely go back every time we are anywhere near this place.  It was also family friendly (and they sat them in the dining area away from the bar which was nice for us with out kids sitting at the bar)."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great drinks! Burger night is on Tuesday's and they're all fantastic. I love the Cowboy Stew soup, although all of their soups are tasty bc they're home made. Free candy on all of the tables is a cute touch. The grilled cheese is awesome! I would definitely suggest the soup or a burger! Everything on the menu is worth trying. Only sad thing is they're closed on Sundays, but hey, doesn't everyone deserve a day off?"}
{"text":"This is our favorite bar/restaurant to go to. There are a variety of menu options and lots of tasty candy to enjoy at the bar. The service is always wonderful and the manager is the best. This will always be our favorite local bar. We love it."}
{"text":"Fantastic little neighborhood restaurant. It is so much more than a bar. It has a great menu with delicious home cooked meals. The owner is onsite and remembers everybody's name. The grilled fish wrap is a must have! Also try her Moscow mules, they are out of this world."}
{"text":"Food is always good here.  Penny candy on table tops is unique.  Very good homemade sangria."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! Elsa is super friendly...always!   Great atmosphere  Great food  & always great beer selection  several seasonal  beers on hand!   Give it a try"}
{"text":"Local go to place. Good bar food and always friendly service.  Food actually cooked well and tastes good. Good draft Guinness. Plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  My wife and I love it.  Every time we go the staff makes us feel like we were just there yesterday.  We get great service and even better the food is great.  We always get the Hot Pepper Cheese Balls.     It's really just the best place to go, sit, relax and have a good conversation at the end of a long day.  Have a beer and a burger.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  We were first timers and from the time we walked in until we left the experience was amazing.  Food was good and cooked to perfection, the bartender was so friendly and the candy on the bar was a perfect touch.  We travel to try different places and would definitely make the 45 minute trip again when we have the time!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here and a couple of drinks. I was really pleased, mainly for the friendly and comfortable atmosphere. This is a real nice neighborhood bar/restaurant that you can go to and feel right at home.   It's fairly small with a rectangular bar in the center as you enter. It looked like there was a separate dining area in the back, and there were some tables along the side of the bar.   I sat at the bar and there was a very friendly lady working behind the bar. They had a limited draft beer selection but one nice rotating draft, a Magic Hat IPA.   The menu is mainly sandwiches, burgers and wraps. I got their burger special for the day that allowed two free toppings. The list of toppings is pretty big, but I just got cheddar and an onion ring. There is a quarter and half pound size burger. I got the half pound for $9. It comes with home made chips. That's a pretty good price.   The bar stools were real comfortable and it was as a nice place to sit and relax. There were a couple of screens in the bar area that they switched to a Pirates game when it started.   Looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. Very cute on the inside! I expected it to be a dive, but it truly is not! You can tell the owner loves it and puts her soul into every aspect of the bar. It is very clean, and has such cute little details. I like her decorating style. The bartender was very friendly, and the atmosphere is too. As others have stated, there's candy at the bar, which is kind of funny to me, but hey I won't lie I had some!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 1-star reviews, but after our experience at Someone Else's Bar last night, I honestly couldn't bring myself to bump it up to 2.  We decided to stop here as we were looking for a quick dinner prior to heading to Hundred Acres Manor on a Saturday evening.  We figured, good ratings, bar food, it couldn't take more than 1-1.5 hours...  wrong.  When we walked into the bar, we weren't sure what to think.  Without any waiting space, we were smashed up against the bar and waiting to figure out who was going to greet us at the \"Please wait to be seated sign\".  The bar/restaurant seemed busy (which we figured was a good sign) and we were eventually greeted by a server/hostess/manager that couldn't really give us an estimated wait time nor next steps.  After some confusion, she suggested we go wait outside on the back patio with a few beers, which we complied.  After about a half-hour of freezing outside (a separate family and us had fun joking about it being 55F and being asked to wait outside with no heaters) we were asked to come in and given a table by the bar.  To cut a long story short...  the service was horrible.  Granted, our server said it was only her third day, but was it really necessary to have to retake our drink orders three times?  We ordered what I thought would be quick fix food.  Two quesadillas and two fish sandwiches.  After about an hour wait, we pressed our server for our food and were told it was being placed \"in the window.\"  Half an hour later and another follow-up, we finally had our food.  Now...  had the restaurant still been busting at the seams, I would of had more sympathy.  But at this point, the restaurant was half-full and quite tepid to be honest.  While the quesadillas were good, my fish sandwich lacked any flavor and the sweet potato fries were greasy, mushy and bland.  When I asked to see the manager...  the hostess that originally greeted us came over and gave us nothing but attitude when we complained about the service, food time and being mislead about it \"being in the window\".  She mentioned that \"she was going to comp us a round of drinks but never got around to it\" and that she couldn't help that she had to be back in the kitchen.  With a little more prose and sympathy, I think I would of been willing to rate this higher and give it another shot on another date...  but that was the final stake in this Halloween terror."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, the crowd is cliquey, and if the staff doesn't recognize you as part of the clique, you can die of thirst. That's if you can get seated in the first place. The owner is the worst, so I'm not surprised by the complete atmosphere of private party."}
{"text":"I love eating at Someone Else's Bar and Restaurant!  I have tried almost everything on the menu and it is all great.  The service is warm and friendly.  Best place in the Burg!  Tuesday's burger night is my favorite."}
{"text":"My family ate here for the first time tonight and loved it. Large (free) parking lot and a really cute and nice establishment. Food was great, nice beer selection and cocktails. Our two-year-old even ate everything we put in front of her! The candy is a nice touch. We ended our visit with drinks and games on the patio.   We are looking forward to returning with friends and family."}
{"text":"I walked in with a few friends which I have done many times before. I greeted the owner and bartender by their names then we ordered drinks and my friend went to the restroom. After about 10 minutes the bartender asked where my friend was. We told her that our friend was having an upset stomach and that he was probably just going number two. This immediately started chatter between the owner and bartender. It was obvious they were talking about us.   The owner knocked on the restroom door multiple times. The bartender made several comments to other patrons about how our friend should \"poop wherever he ate\". When my friend emerged from making fudge dragons the bartender said \"I hope you cleaned up after yourself\".   My friend was humiliated. I was embarrassed for the owner and bartender as they were prying, invasive, rude and childish. I've never had an experience like this anywhere else. I would endorse this place as having a decent beer selection but don't be surprised if they make you feel guilty for using the restroom."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers.....and friendly folks!  They will definitely see us again.  Great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger with our daughter, asked to wait for a table, went out on the back deck and colored, ate licorice and blew bubbles. I almost forgot we stopped for food we were having such a good time. Any place that I can relax and enjoy a good meal with my toddler is a bonus. Great decor, great service and great food. We will return."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Else operates a great establishment. Great food, great, friendly staff. Always a great place to go for fun, fun, fun!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pub food, very friendly service and free candy at the bar  I had a decent size chicken Caesar salad and my wife enjoyed the rodeo burger - bacon, cheese, onion ring and bbq sauce. We shared an appetizer of giant, very freshly breaded mushrooms.   Everything is made to order and quality ingredients. That's awesome for a relatively small neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Over an hour wait for food on a Tuesday evening.  Only positive part was the candy on the table.  1st and last time.  Had better burgers at McDonald's"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great ambience with a fun atmosphere!  We ate in the bar area but lots of families were being seated in the dining area.  My friend and I split an order of six Jamaican Jerk wings that were so delish and we both had burgers (I had the spicy one with banana peppers, pepper jack cheese and Cajun spices).  It was so very good!  We both said we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars because the service was great. The food; on the other hand, was just OK.  I had the Blazing Saddles burger. Good & spicy, but needed some kind of sauce on it to cool things down some. Sweet potato fries with brown suger were good, but could've been better.  We had a nachos appetizer that was great, though. Topped with their chili that; if I'd known it was that good, would've ordered it.  Free candy on the bar & all the tables."}
{"text":"The coolest bar I have been to in Pittsburg...free candy and the nicest bartenders with the best food.. Will be back for the quesadilla. If you're in the area this is a must hands-down. Food candy fun ..  Super blow pops at the door... what can't go wrong"}
{"text":"My go to spot for the best dry-rub wings in the city. Build your own burgers and quesadillas are always a great choice as well. Friendly staff and owner with all the free candy you can eat at your table/bar."}
{"text":"Passive aggressive signs posted everywhere- the moment you walk in there is a sign in your face with 5 lines overwritten lines with the simple message to wait to be seated. Homemade chips were dark and very hard. When we mentioned it we were told the whole batch is that way- definitely not made to order. Then the owner was talking about it passive aggressively at the bar when the waitress went to her. Then her and two staff were commenting on a kitchen staff and attacking his personality. As a customer, I really want a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The burger was good but the environment was not what I hope for and two burgers- no drinks- ended up being about $30. Good food for the most part but would not return. Seems like local regulars have their place and I did not belong."}
{"text":"Someone Else's Bar is the ultimate 'introductory' bar for someone who isn't a fan of loud, crowded, noisy bars (like me) - after you visit I'm not sure you'd want to even 'move up' to more expensive, bigger establishments. It's a welcoming, down-to-earth place with fantastic, affordable food.   My best friend lived in the apartment right next to SEB for about a year, and when I lived in the South Hills still, we'd go over probably two or three times a month. The waitresses knew us by name (we were known as \"the kids\" since the majority of customers here are my parents' age, maybe 35-50 year olds). It makes for a great audience, and a very personal feel. You will always get great, friendly service, whether you're at the bar, or at a table. I have eaten there plenty of times at both and have always felt like Someone Else's Bar was a second home. I've only had one experience here where the service at the bar was \"just okay.\"   As for the food, it's standard American fare - nothing groundbreaking - but always delicious. Portion sizes are generous, especially the Viking sandwich, which is a fried buffalo chicken breast about 12\" long on a gigantic bun. I'm not sure you can find a better, bigger, tastier sandwich in the South Hills. Burger night is a great choice since you can customize your burger with all sorts of toppings (cajun jerk seasoning, blue cheese, some things you don't see often on other menus). Just watch, though, since every additional topping costs more. You can rack up a $13 burger if you're not careful (but it'll be the size of your head so it's worth it).   The charm of Someone Else's Bar lies in the quirky details. There is a jar of candy on every table and scattered around the restaurant. They have all kinds of fun, seasonally-changing soaps in the bathrooms. There are fun accessories hanging on the walls, and the decor is pleasantly kitschy. It's just, plain and simple, a fun place to go. Bring your friends, because taking up a table for yourself isn't the best use of space. SEB gets crowded quickly, especially when a Pens/Steelers/Pirates game is on. This is about its only downfall. I wish they had more seating, though I do know they recently expanded with outdoor seating around back.   I miss living so close to Someone Else's Bar - but it's honestly worth crossing a few bridges and rivers to get there. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is excellent and the service is quick. Everyone that works there is friendly. My only complaint, I wish it was bigger and they could add more tables. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go around Castle Shannon/Mt Leb.  Food is always great and service is always with a smile.  Elsa is a great face to have attached to the front of house as she is always personable and vivacious.  A true gem in the area.  I highly recommend the wings as well as just about anything that m  he menu, never had a par or sub par meal.  The atmosphere is great for friends and or family and the candy at the bar and on the tables is a nice added touch."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of great little places in the south hills that offer great food, great drink and great company!  I've never had anything that I don't like...but there are things that I keep going back to.  Like the Cheezam (ham, cheese, relish, grilled all golden and yummy)!  Burgers are always a great choice (the Rodeo burger is my favorite), as is the Sloppy Joe (sloppy and yummy goodness).  Just a side of fries, with cheese, bacon and sour cream...oh my.  ABSOLUTELY try the soup - whatever soup it is (if you see the Loaded Baked Potato, Cowboy Stew or Stuffed Pepper soups....get one.  Get all.  Take some home!!!). Great place!"}
{"text":"3 females. Ok, wearing beads...was not even permitted into the place to eat dinner. Why? Because it was St. Day and we have beads on. We have masters degrees, we are not drunk, and we did not even have a chance to walk into the door. I feel like I understand what discrimination means now."}
{"text":"If you are looking for someplace to go in the south hills of Pittsburgh i would definitely recommend Someone Else's Bar.  The drink selection is good, and the food is fantastic.  The true highlight of Else's is the staff.  Everyone is incredibly friendly and makes it a point to remember your name.  The free candy sprinkled around is also a nice touch.  Really a fun low key place to spend a few hours."}
{"text":"Great place for anyone over the age of 40. If you are in your 20's you eyed up the minute you enter. It took 10 minutes and 3 bartenders to approve my STATE ISSUED drivers license and they still questioned me. The bartender also reminded me it was a non smoking environment when I put my smokes and wallet on the table, I always empty my pockets when I sit down! This was a terrible choice and in my opinion the bar is more of a family restaurant than it is a bar. YOUNG CROWDS SHOULD AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I've ever experienced. I can't fathom over 1 1/2 hours ... And still no food. Who cares if the food is good... Why wait that long?"}
{"text":"Yes sir, a great little bar with good food and fun place to hang with friends.  Food is better than most bars and Else is great.  A place where they remember your name.  Always friendly and good service."}
{"text":"been a regular at this place but the last time we were there will be our last. Cains is better alternative!   1) they ask you how you want your burger made but it's never delivered the way you ask. I ask for med rare but always get well done.  2) their shirts say be nice or else but they themselves are not that nice. the place is like a click, they choose who they're nice to.  3) the food is drenched in salt and you feel like a prune even after drinking a gallon of water. I felt like crap the rest of the night after eating here 4) they nickel and dime you for extras. especially the PACKAGED avocado! gross"}
{"text":"I have been to Else's a few times and it's a great little neighborhood place.  Candy on all the tables and the bar for snacking, really delicious food, decent prices and always great service.  Tonight we went there and had a little confusion with the bill - the item in question was immediately removed from the bill, which I didn't even ask for.  I've had a great time every time and burger night is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"this place is a great little neighborhood find. just over the hill for me! but it IS little! don't expect alot of elbow room. the bar takes up the main room with 4-5 tables against the wall. there's a back room with a few more tables. the place has been packed everytime we've been there, so expect to wait a litlle for a seat. the decor is a mish mash of everything, but it works here. there are jars of free candy everywhere too. that sounds great, but for me, especially during this cold & flu season, & the fact that kids eat there alot, i'll pass! i've taken the food safety course from the health dept.!!! as a confirmed \"red wino\", i usually get old stuff that has been sitting for ages when i go to a small bar. not here!!! decent wine & even nice glasses! the food is really good! but then, bar food usually is, that's what makes them so great! basic stuff, nothing fancy, but really good! i had the steak salad this time. perfect. tom had a hamburger made to his liking. he thoroughly enjoyed it! we've also had & enjoyed the reuben, fish, sweet potato fries, & onion rings. the food going to other people looked awesome too!!! good food, good prices, good place!"}
{"text":"I ordered cheeseballs (appetizer), and chicken quesadillas,  with a Coke.  The cheeseballs are  deep fried cheese, in quarter-size balls, served with ranch. They were okay. I'm not a fried food fan, but they were free, with a meal (see my tip for getting freebies here).  The quesadillas were okay, but  bland. Perfectly glden brown, they were filled with melted cheese and chunks of tender, white chicken. Chicken was a bit skimpy. Four wedges, with slightly spicy salsa, and sour cream, $9.  Bartender was cordial and very efficient."}
{"text":"Easily one of the more welcoming places I've been to.  The services has been fantastic the three or four times I've been here!  How many places do you go to that the bartender remembers everyones name?The food is really good, but please forgive me as it has been a while and any remember exactly what I've ordered.  I've had burgers twice for sure and they are amazing, probably the best burger in the South Hills, of course I have not tries them all.  I would highly recommend Else's Bar to anyone no matter your age; I'm 27 and have never had an issue here.   My only gripe is that it is really warm in the normal seating area..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We go here when we are in the mood for a dive bar with great food and drinks. The rotating taps are changed often and always feature popular seasonal beers. Drinks are reasonably priced. The service is very personalized (they remembered my name after two visits several months ago!) Elsa rocks! Get the buffalo chicken."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The decor is totally fun (free candy) and the tray tables at the bar are very cute.  The food is amazing and the portions are large.  I have been here several times and each time tried the burgers.  Specifically, the Baha burger has really tasty guacamole.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a laid back, delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Great food (tremendous burgers and quesadillas) but the chicken bites are like nothing I've ever eaten. Worth the trip just for them! Cool little atmosphere. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Just a great little place to have a meal.   Very laid back homey feeling, but with a splash of fun (and candy!) The burgers, wings, and quesadillas are all excellent.    The rotating menu of soups has also always been great.    Always an interesting selection of beers and ciders etc."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand the hype for this place.  Is the candy on the tables fun?  Sure.  But the rest was just average.  We ordered two drinks, the sangria which was way too sweet and the specialty drink made with ginger beer and Meyers rum.  Now I appreciate the effort to make something new and different, but I thought a dark and stormy made with Meyers rum was not going to be very good so I asked if they could use another dark rum instead.  Nope, no other dark rum available.  Really?  Fine, I tried the drink with Meyers rum, as expected, not very good.  The salad was just OK.  The chicken on it was cooked exactly right and was tender without being dry but it had no flavor.  None, zip, nada.  I'm thinking perhaps many people ordering this don't want salt so they aren't going to salt the chicken, but this had nothing on it.  There are lots of options for spice out there that don't have salt.  We also had a burger.  Same issue.  No spices on it at all.  So while it was cooked well and I could easily select my toppings, it was bland.  There were quite a few patrons in the over 60 crowd and perhaps they like bland food?  This place is very close to me so I might give it another try, but I'd stick to beer not mixed drinks and I'd probably get wings instead of a burger or salad."}

{"text":"Monday is Mexican night! Tuesday is burger night! This place kind of looks like if a teenage girl opened a bar, with various pictures taped to the walls, string lights hung around, and candy everywhere for free as bar snacks.   Went for burger night, where patrons can bring their own toppings and share (such as baked beans, or krispy kreme donuts)! There's a bar and tables nearby, and a separate dining area. People are super friendly, and burgers were decent, with a variety of topping choices (make your own!).   The sweet potato fries are recommended."}
