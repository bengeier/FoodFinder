{"text":"A Monroeville classic. Always a reliable place to go for a hoagie in the area. I recommend the steak and egg with American."}
{"text":"Rudys has the best subs around. You can get a huge ruby's sub pre ordered the day before and if you eat it, you get a cool t-shirt. One of those places to splurge days. Awesome joint!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since I was a little girl. I have been getting the steak and egg for over 30 years now.  This location is conveniently open late on Friday and Saturday nights until midnight. Last night after 10pm,  we found ourselves driving to Monroeville for a steak and egg. This location also toasts the buns unlike other locations. It was delicious as usual. We never make it home to actually eat on a plate as the wonderful smell usually makes us pull over....where we eat as if we hadn't eaten in days. It's really quite embarrassing, I'm sure, if anyone would drive by & glance over and see us ravenously eating these subs-and wonder if we were born in a barn-or worse-and then inevitably pull out their phones to record us to later put on youtube as an appetite suppressant.    Occasionally I will get an Italian sub which is also consistently always yummy with crisp, non-slimy lettuce. But there's something special about the Steak & Egg that keeps us coming back for decades."}
{"text":"Been coming to here for years and it's always tasted great and the prices are good.  Fresh buns, good cheese and good fries.  It's a little run down but than again so would any hoagie joint that's been out the for 30 years."}
{"text":"I usually order steak, egg, cheese sub with grilled onions and sweet peppers because normally it's the best sandwich when it's prepared right.It's not consistently made right which is why I am giving 3 stars today. My order wasn't prepared correctly, and had I not read the sign the drink wasn't offered either.  I hope they're just having an off day today."}
{"text":"got 3 subs on sunday, buy 2 get 1 free..not a bad deal, anywho.. the cheeseburger and cheesesteak were OK for being a bit pricey. the 3rd was a pizza sub.. assuming it came with pepperoni i was told that it comes with cheese and sauce.. there was no sauce to be seen at all, just very greasy cheese, almost as if it was cooked on the grill in burger grease it tasted terrible and was extremely gross to look at i took one bite and threw it away. although thats probably their only gross item i will not return due to the slow service..high price for what i recieved, dirty environment, and hey theres 20 other food places down the block that are cheaper and 10x better."}
{"text":"Ate there today for the first time in a while. Had a cheese steak and fries.  Cheese steak was quite good, as I remembered from times there before.  Fries were average, I think a little over cooked, but not too greasy.  Atmosphere was better than I remember it.  It used to be kind of dingy and smokey.  It was cleaner now and no one was smoking there when I was there (not sure if they are actually allowed to smoke there anymore or not.)  BTW - I think they have take out beer here only (no wine).  That's probably a PA peculiarity, but it is not a choice in Yelp's alcohol selection."}
{"text":"Great little hometown restaurant. Orders are always right. Staff is always friendly. Win win."}
{"text":"Haven't been there for years.  Had a steak sub yesterday and was very disappointed.  The steak was just like a Steak Um.  I could have made that at home."}
{"text":"Good steak sub and chocolate chunk cookies and fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"If you're craving a really good cheesesteak and you're near or in Monroeville, then this is the joint. They used really good sub rolls that are toasted. The ingredients are fresh and steak meat is prepared well. We're never disappointed with the cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"I must say...their cheesesteaks are AMAZING! My boyfriend introduced this place to me because I was missing home *philly* & I really wanted a cheesesteak. We split one & I was looking at his cause a half wasn't enough lol. Well the next day I drove back to Rudy's to get a full one for myself."}
{"text":"Booths are to small needs more remodeling and parking forget about it but if you love a great steak & cheese at a good price then stop by. 1/2 a sandwich French fries and a drink $7.99. On Sunday by two hole sandwiches get one free. You can thank me latter"}
{"text":"Overpriced GARBAGE! with all the sub places around, including Sheetz, it's amazing this place is still in business. Subs are small, overpriced and devoid of taste or anything that makes you happy or want to come back. What costs over $10 here is $6 at sheetz or even Subway....and they taste soo much better. Shame on you Rudys, you are a crook, not at sub shop!"}
{"text":"My wife just picked me up buffalo wings mild, these wing are far from mild. I go up there and he has the nerve to claim he told my wife that they only have Buffalo, if that was the case my wife would never have gotten them as she knows I would never eat them. Now since the manager won't be the until Wednesday I will return them cold. He offered me every other type of wing but what I wanted. Ive never eaten at a place where is no manager running the place to give me a refund!"}
{"text":"Very good food cheap prices. always a good place for lunch they have their combo meals."}
{"text":"This place is not spectacular, but it gets the job done.  A tasty sandwich, fries, and a drink for $7.99.  If it was closer to my work site, I would go more."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to read all the negative reviews as this is a really solid sandwich shop.  It's a great lunch spot if you're in the mood for some good, quick eats and a full belly.   While I would recommend the lunch special - half a sandwich, French fries, and a drink - Rudy's offers a variety of \"submarines\" that can be made just the way you like them.  Whether your a simple meat and cheese person or into the specialty or Italian meats, they have it on the menu, along with all the fixins' you could possibly want.  They even sell novelty sized sandwiches in the 3-foot and 6-foot variety should you want to entertain or just flat out pig out yourself.    This is a worthy weekday stop and is certainly a place to consider for game day and tailgating."}
{"text":"Rudy's is the best sub in holiday park!! The bread is the best you can get. Always have the Rudy's special steak!"}
{"text":"Been a Fan for Years.  I have been eating Rudy's subs for as far back as I can remember. My mother had me start on capicola & cheese, but i really haven't steered to far from the that. I am an old fashion Italian Hoagie kinda guy. I have tried them all, from Fox's to Subway. I have to say the best hot Italian hoagie around the East side of Pittsburgh.   I have never really tried more than the capicola or Italian for the oast 20+ years. Now that is strange for this guy, I love to try new things. just don't know why I have never expanded my menu at this joint. I'm not a big Steak & Cheese hoagie kinda guy, like I have previously stated, more of a cold cut guy. My wife :LOVES the cheeseburger hoagie, I mean LOVES it!, Almost scary loves it.  So it is a definite Jedi certifiable place to grub.  Jedi Menu Recommendations  * Italian Hoagie ( has great cap on it) * Capicola & Cheese (duh) * Cheeseburger Hoagie (the wifes FAVORITE hoagie)"}
{"text":"I stopped here 3 times during my Pittsburgh visit and had some good food. I had a Rudy Steak special (I think that's what it is called)l, an Italian and a \"capicola and cheese\" and they were all fresh and a nice combination of ingredients. Parking was a little tight but since it's mostly takeout it was OK."}
{"text":"As a loyal customer, I will tell you straight up....it depends on what you order.  Some of the hoagies are just what they are, nothing special except the bun.  The bun is always amazing.   The capicola hoagie, warm, with everything.....is like heaven on a bun.  The meat is a little lighter than it used to be, but the taste is still there!  The fresh bun, fresh ingredients, and sub dressing makes it a one of a kind.   The service is great.  They will make the sandwich just how you want it.  There is little to no additional charging!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, however it takes about 30 minutes to get 3 subs while the place is practically empty."}
{"text":"My husband's family tradition; huge variety of subs & all around delicious! Great service & subs came quickly, made to order. Now one of my fave places!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, I got the Rudy Special you're typical steakumm steak sandwich, the quality left a lot to be desired. It was a decent size for the price."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't rate it one star is because I've been before and gotten great food and great service. Every other time, though, has been during the week when the owner is there and his son is in the kitchen cooking. This is my first time going on the weekend, and it will also be my last time.  We stood at the counter waiting to order for about five minutes while the lady behind the counter took a phone order. There were two people in the kitchen cooking. After ordering, we sat down to wait for our food. And we waited. And we waited. After 20 minutes of waiting for a cheeseburger and a 6\" cheeseburger sub, I went back up to the counter to ask if it would be much longer. I was told it wouldn't only be about another minute (but I think they lost the order because I had to take my ticket back up to the counter and she pushed buttons on the register.....all before telling me it would only be another minute).  So I sat down to wait some more. Ten minutes went by and after we watched people who had come in after us with a larger party get their order, I was done. I told them I wanted my  money back; we'd go some place else. I was told the food was coming off the grill. Yeah, I was kind of told that once already. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I said I didn't care and wanted a refund. Over 30 mins for a hamburger more than exceeds my patience level, especially when the place isn't crowded. No one (besides the family that came in after us) was waiting for their order.  I was refunded the money and left. I didn't see it because I had my back to her, but my granddaughter saw it - the woman behind the register was rolling her eyes at me and giving me a dirty look. That sealed it for me.....never again will I go to Rudy's"}
{"text":"1st  i must say i haven't eaten here in a long long long time ,my mom used to take me here back when i was a little kid.  nothing but great experiences here.  loved the ham and cheese sub... lettuce shredded (no bagged crap) onions sliced thin, tomato fresh... Every Sub i have eaten since then has been compared to Rudy's....I noticed this place moved... i thought it was yellow before not red."}
{"text":"Black in the Hat here, just found this place I am a Southside boy so never really ventured out this way for food, thanks to PB for introducing me to this place. BUT DANG SON!!!!! Talk about a sandwich, I was 3/4 of the way through before I said wow this sandwich is bananas!! Now I have tried other sub shops. If anyone remembers Rudy's in Mt. Oliver this shop is up there with that!!!!! I mean......... I don't know what to say anymore.....I'm hungry... BITH Out!!!  Rudy's: Get the Special!!! I said get the SPECIAL!! And a drink, they have the dope styrofoam cups... the tall ones that the kids these days drink lean out of."}
{"text":"Ehhh..I wish I could say I enjoyed the food here! But, I really didn't think that it was quality! I mean the prices were fair but it just wasn't enjoyable...so then i guess that makes the \"prices were fair\" thing debatable...but moving on...I ordered a cheese steak hoagie and some of the lettuce was brown which happens, I don't need to split hairs over that. But, the steak used tasted very very familiar to me. I have a family that loves cheese steak sammies to the point that they are willing to go to great lengths to eat them. Growing up with these sammich lovers, sometimes that meant being subjected to a lower form... steak-ums...Desperate times, desperate measures. While I have a little, disgusting, weak spot for these frozen treats...it isn't something I want to be served at a restaurant nor have I had them since I was 18 (it is hard but i resist).My boyfriend had an Italian hoagie and wasn't too impressed by it. I probably will not go back for another try and am honestly thankful I don't have much of reason to be in Monroeville to ever have an excuse."}
{"text":"living in LA now, i'm always missed those corner sub places they got on the east coast... too bad this is not one of them hot spots... but for the price..you can't get mad at em... basically if your hungry and need a bite to eat for lunch....this is the place."}
{"text":"Rudys Subs on the Golden Mile Parkway makes great submarine sandwiches. Today I had the Cappicola sub with cheese, bacon, fried egg, and onions. I put some of my fries on it, just because, that's what Pittsburghers do. The Cap is delicious, a little kick to it. The bread was toasted, tasty and fresh. Topping it off with Ranch dressing, this was a delicious Sub. Rudys, I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Something happening here that I just can't put my finger on!  Ordered take-out yesterday of my favorite:  a hot ham and cheese (American) sub and it was terrible! I don't know if it was the quality of meat, not grilled long enough or they switched type of bread that was the problem?  Really disappointed in the sub. First time I couldn't finish one of their subs!  My two companions who had the same order, both agreed.  Not returning anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Love Rudy's. Anytime I'm out on Golden Mile Highway I stop for a sub at Rudy's. The bread really makes the subs here. Also the staff is super friendly and remembers me every time I return even after months away."}
{"text":"Soft bread and great subs...plus a beer cooler.  Came here while I waited for my new wheels to get put on. My mom use to bring me here as a kid a lot and I would always get the peppered egg sub with ham. MMMMH, Its absolutely great with mayo or brown mustard.  They didn't serve beer when i last remembered but now the do and you can drink inside! I ordered the lunch special which is a 6in sub, fries and a drink for $7.99. Good deal, I swapped out the soda for a mike's hard strawberry lemonade for an extra dollar.  Although this place is small it has enough seating for their average crowd. Its a good goto hoagie place with over 20 options to choose from plus other foods like pizza and your fried goodies. I will be stopping here more often, i miss this place!"}
{"text":"Normally, we order Italian subs from Rudy's which are awesome. Last time we went, we wanted to try some different subs. We got the cheeseburger sub, chicken parm, and a ham/bacon/chicken. all three weren't so great. They didn't compare to the Italians we normally order. The hamburger sub didn't have much flavor. The chicken parm sub was burnt. The ham/bacon/chicken was alright but some of the chicken was extra chewy. Highly recommend the Italian, other than those we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"I will defiantly save my money and not return here again. I ordered a fish sandwich, it was drenched in oil, appeared previously frozen, bottom line you're better off getting a McDonald's or Wendy's fish sandwich (something I've not eaten since high school)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best subs in town - of course on mancinis bread. We got 2 half hoagies , large cheese fries , and chicken tenders for $23 ! Everything was hot and delicious and served quickly being it was a dinner time saturday rush. Lots of carry out amd eat in orders and they flowed right through them. I prefer this location out of them all - even the original in swissvale ."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. I like subs but not a certain type. I asked for the most popular. I was told the steak and mushroom sub. I got the 12 inch one and it was quite large. A lot of meat and toppings. It was a very good sub. The fries were normal fries. Nothing special except that were cooked perfect. Not soggy like some places. Not a lot of parking around and a bit older looking but I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Came here on a mad craving for some hoagies. This place always seems busy so decided to give it a shot.   My boyfriend and I decided on the Italian, served hot, and the chicken parm. Since we mentioned we were new to pittsburgh and love Philly cheesesteaks, the owner threw in one for free! I was so amazed. All the hoagies were fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Philly cheesesteak. Aaaahhhmazinng! I will be back.   I believe on Sundays they do a buy two get one free."}
{"text":"The great: The bread -- which I'm told was from Cellone's Bakery, was awesome -- light and airy, not too thick, so you don't get just a mouthful of bread when you take a bite.   The good: The Italian sub, per hubby, was delicious, said the meat was flavorful. My steak and cheese was okay, but the meat was very \"steak-um\" tasting.   The expected, but always a plus: Everyone was very friendly.   The okay: The price for 1/2 a sub, fries, and a drink was $7.99, which felt like an okay deal to me for lunch.   The bad: A 12\" sub is $9+, which seems awfully expensive to me, especially if you want to add in a side or drink.   We'll definitely be back, but hubby said he'd go for the $7.99 special instead of the 12\" next time."}
{"text":"Subs are on point! However, it's a hole in the wall. They could definitely do a better job cleaning up the front of the house. Get it to go, you won't be disappointed! Stars if you get it to go!"}
{"text":"Best subs in Pittsburgh, the bread is just right not too filling, great tasting meats, and an awesome, friendly staff. And they use McDonald's fries which is such a bonus. I promise you, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Rudy's is a staple in Pittsburgh's east neighborhoods.  The bread is really freah and so are the meats that Ive had there.  My wife always gets the regular Italian which is very good.  I like to mix it up.  Ive had the capicola, pizza, steak and cheese, and the ham and cheese.  All have been very good.  I havent tried anything else at Rudys besides the subs, but why would you get anything else!"}
{"text":"You walk in the door and see a pretty dirty, rundown building. The service is pretty slow but not a problem if you get takeout and call ahead.   The beer selection is not anything to write home about they had a few seasonal craft beers then your usual coors/bud/miller fare of varieties. Mikes Hard, old English, and Twisted tea are all available. $8.99 Dos Equis 6 packs is a nice buy though.   When my mushroom cheesesteak arrived it smelt amazing. The bread was perfect and the cheese was plentiful. The steak was a bit dry nothing some mayo or Italian won't fix though. The lettuce was fresh and the mushrooms were good. A whole hoagie is about $9 and also a rare place that sells pizza by the slice.  I can't say that this place blew me out of the water but even though I am only going to give it 3 stars, I will definitely be back to try different sandwiches and the pizza. I'm a real sucker for little places like this and I think it has at least earned a second chance. You won't find me doing any beer shopping here though."}
{"text":"This definitely isn't Subway. Their Italian hoagie with fries is my perfect lunch. It's rare to find a restaurant that I, my husband, and my parents agree on, but my parents were super impressed when we got Rudy's takeout!"}
{"text":"The food here is so great that I won't eat subs anywhere else. It's family owned and the staff is awesome. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're definitely missing out."}
{"text":"This place usually has great food. However, tonight I ordered food to go, and I'm regretting not getting a sub from penn station down the road. My sub bread is super hard, and I ordered cheese fries only to find that the container of cheese melted somehow and now I have soggy cheese fries to enjoy ."}
{"text":"Love their subs. Order from them often. Wouldn't buy one anywhere else. Great rolls, meat, etc. Place is always very clean when ever I stop for my order. Employees are nice and friendly."}
