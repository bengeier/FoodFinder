{"text":"First time at the peninsula china bistro.  Walls were a little dirty and tables were not very clean.  But getting past that the food was very good. Sauces seemed to be homemade not from a jar.  Very pleasant experience.  Service was very good.  It was a week night so it wasn't very crowded.  Yes I would go back again"}
{"text":"The food and service has always been great.  Definitely the place in Cornelius to get authentic fresh sushi and traditional Asian food. Great lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"Get the Orange chicken. Puts PF Chang's to shame. Tried the sushi and it was good. I think this place may take off."}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food! I've been there like 15 times every time a good experience! I only gave this place 4 stars because once in a while they would get out orders mixed up, but the service is great, the food AWESOME, so I gave this restraint 4 stars because is a great restraint and the food is AWESOME- i love this restraint and if you have not been I would defiantly request this   Restraint!!!"}
{"text":"Their specials can be a great deal and I like what they did to redo the decor. It's kinda empty most of the time which is too bad, I like it but good ambiance means other people are there."}
{"text":"Third stop today... Jackpot !!! How did we ever miss this place? This is an easy 5 stars but we felt that $7.50 for two hot teas was a bit pricey. We have to admit though, it was the best jasmine tea we ever tasted, fresh and organic. The prices on they're sushi are compapable to some other places yet still cheaper than eeZ. The rolls are fresh and Fantastic !!! If you havent tried this place yet you should. It may become your top pick for the area. Definitly within the top 3. Also, they have happy hour every day from 3-6pm and for every two specialty rolls ordered you get $10 off !!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around! It is a bit expensive, but the food is worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"Truly, truly, truly the WORST service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I am honestly not one for dramatics, either.   A group of coworkers and I decided to try it out today after reading the great reviews on Yelp and were really let down. The food was okay, but not anything better than you can get for five bucks at your local hole-in-the-wall Asian takeout place. Our server came to the table only a few times, and when he did, it was often to let us know that he had forgotten to enter our orders and had come back for us to remind him what he wanted. A coworker had to walk up to the bar and ask where our table's one sushi order was after about 35 minutes. Not a single refill even after asking twice. Our server came by a total of three times to ask if we were ready for our checks (we had already said yes every other time). One of us even had to leave to go pick up dry cleaning next store as to not miss a 1:30 meeting (we arrived at 11:55) and when he got back, the table was STILL waiting on the check. It may be worth a mention that we were the only table in the entire restaurant. The waiter was either new, or just terrible/forgetful.   This was an almost 2 hour endeavor on our 1 hour lunch break allowance. Low grade food, terrible service, long wait time... we will never be back."}
{"text":"The sushi is awesome! Delicious variety of specialty rolls, all priced well (less expensive than Eez, with more creative combinations). The waitstaff has only been good once, lately its been the college/highschool aged kids that don't care. Epidemic for the area. Sigh.   The specials are always great, and the food is seriously delicious (if you can get your server to bring your food to your table).  TIP: If you're getting sushi, sit AT the sushi bar. The sushi chef is fast and can hand it to you. If you sit at the bar, the bartender still has to bring it to you...when he feels like it....but the bartender also services the sushi bar, so skip the wait and sit closer to your food.   I also love the cute flowers they use for sushi garnishes, I usually put them in my hair for going out the rest of the night. Nice bonus."}
{"text":"I ate here with family members from the UK. Food great, place great, staff great. Loved the entire evening and will return regularly.  Very good value for money."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food for a small town (we were visiting from LA). We tried the general tso's chicken, soft shell crab appetizer, lettuce cups and another beef dish. Everything was ok except the lettuce cup is very runny and sauce isnt that tasty."}
{"text":"I've been told they re-opened.  Can't wait to go find out for sure."}
{"text":"They offer the best Chinese food anywhere around the lake. It is a little pricey but definitely worth the money. We only eat in, so I've never had take out, but the atmosphere and the service are both incredible. the food quality is hands-down fantastic!"}
{"text":"Peninsula china bistro has changed location and name, they are now across the square from where they were and though the space is considerably smaller the food is still AMAZINGLY fresh and delicious!!!! I have eaten Chinese food all over the world and the states and while it has always been consistently good throughout my world travels, NC and S.C. for some reason have been quite disappointing except for Huang's!!! I drive up from Columbia SC and choose this place every time! Though I have not tried everything on the  menu, I have tried their chicken, beef and pork fried rices and they are fresh, very fresh and delicious. We have had the potstickers and spring rolls often and absolutely loved those. We used to hang at the park by the gazebo and order food easy to eat so those were our staple dishes. When we ate in we tried a variety of plates and all of them tasted fresh and perfectly cooked. The atmosphere is nice, decor is up to date, place is clean and friendly. I do recommend this place, for a restaurant in this area it is the best I have had. The sad part it is always empty, no idea why for this is really the best, freshest Chinese food around."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to this place on a Friday night around 8:30pm. Pretty quiet but still the wait staff was slow. We ordered several sushi items, one recommended by the waiter, and enjoyed all of them. No complaints. The decor is clean, modern and accented with red. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"So amazing! We haven't had an experience dining yet because we've done delivery.  Twice so far, and both times it's been so great!  The sushi is very good! I'm used to the sushi in the north east, so was very surprised how good it was!  Also had the hibachi and that too was great! Wish they had side sauces for the hibachi like other hibachi places.   My one gripe is with our first delivery.... The delivery driver (lady) that delivered had her son in the car with her. Who appeared to be 3 maybe 4....   The kid hopped out of the car and came to the door with her.  It was definitely weird!!!!   Probably the owner and her son, if not that's a huge liability!!!    This is the reasoning why I didn't rate it 5 stars.   However we will totally order again as this blows away other locations in the Cornelius, Huntersville area!"}
{"text":"Always great food, presentation and service. One of the best Asian places around.  Seems to be one of Cornelius best kept secrets!  Average prices, great atmosphere and decor.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Peninsula China Bistro is a little more upscale than your dime-a-dozen chinese strip mall restaurants, and probably falls somewhere in between those and a place such as P.F. Chang's.  This is evident by the goldfish pond just inside the entrance, with huge, giant goldfish swimming around!  The restaurant is fairly open, almost a studio-like feel, and the service is prompt and courteous.   The food is also excellent...my favorite is the egg drop soup and the Peninsula fried rice. I also enjoyed the sweet n' sour chicken, which is always a good measuring stick for a Chinese eatery.  The tea, which is usually atrocious at most Chinese restaurants, is not bad here, and that was a pleasant surprise.  They also offer delivery, which is a nice plus.  You can expect to spend $15-20 if an appetizer is involved.  This place has now become my go-to location for local Chinese food."}
{"text":"We've gone here for years, but it's easy to forget about Peninsula China Bistro when there are so many options. That's a shame, because the food is always good, and their prices are super reasonable for the serving sizes and quality. Really friendly service. My only complaint is the hot and sour soup. It has no flavor and wasn't spicy or sour. They should try a new recipe."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Great service. Reasonable priced. Not a buffet very classy. Variety of menu and at the bar. I'll be sure to come back and tell family and friends"}
{"text":"Food is fabulous.  décor is nice - red and black.  Wait staff didn't match the ambiance.  the jeans and snickers go better in a bbq place.  also, the staff kept rushing us.  we barely sat down and were asked to order.  and, there were only 6 tables of people.  what is the hurry?  in addition to the rushed dining, staff members had their crying  children there.  their kids got a lot of attention.  But, the FOOD IS FABULOUS."}
{"text":"Okay, we have been here about 15 times, love love love it!!!  Why no 5 star, cause the sushi chef moves like pond water.  For those of you that do not know southern rednek  slang, that means S L O W!  But it is a great place with great atmosphere!  The spicy crab is to die for.  A little background on the crab, the server, who has been with the owner for several years told us that there are several levels of restaraunt quality crab, and the owner is a lover of crab, so he buys the hightest grade possible.  I do not know if this is BS, but it is sure goooood.  Okay, so Tuesday's are half price maki rolls.  My wife and I order 4 rolls each, 8 total for $23.  Can you say hell yeah?  *******NOTICE ---- I have a quick tip on this ---- they have all you can eat for $30.  While that might sound high, you have to realize it is a full menu.  That is apps, main entrees, sushi (any type) and, yes, I am going there - DESSERT!"}
{"text":"Stunning decorating. Large koi pond inside. Soothing atmosphere. Food & service excellent. Friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"4 of us ate here on a Saturday evening around 7pm.  We were greeted at the door by an adorable young man who graciously held the door open for us.  There was no wait time.  We were seated immediately.  Our order was taken and served to our table promptly.  The sesame chicken was the best I have ever eaten.  Unlike the previous review, this was infinitely better than the typical  \"hole in the wall Asian takeout\".  We had Mongolian Beef, Cashew beef, and the Sesame chicken.  I will definitely make this a regular hangout!  We loved it and the service was impeccable.  The décor was very inviting.  We had thought we would sit outside but upon entering and seeing the lovely Asian décor, we opted to sit inside.  Our whole experience was very satisfying and fulfilling!  We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The food is spectacular and the ambiance is just as great. They have affordable prices and great sushi specials. We were less than pleased with the actual service from the waitress. She was very nice but seemed a bit lost most of the night. It took us over an hour to get our main course. She also forgot that one of our meals came with soup and salad and disappeared for long periods of time. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Another Yelper, whose reviews usually lead me to some good stuff, enjoyed this place so we thought we'd give it a try this past Saturday night. We are always on the look out for good Asian food and Peninsula hit the spot.   Tucked away in a multi-use center off Old Jetton Rd., Peninsula is located on the corner opposite Alton's. We arrived early (I felt like a flippin' senior citizen) and were promptly greeted and seated. The dining area is large, dark, filled w/mirrors and funky fringed curtains. The red leather seats are butter soft but the room length banquet is not great for confining curious kids. A fish pond is off to the side and brings much delight to the little people (kids, not dwarfes....tho I'm sure they enjoy a nice pond as much as full sized adults....I digress.)  The server was prompt and friendly but he was quite forgetful. We didn't get refills, had to ask for silverware, and had to remind him to bring things out. He was, however, patient when our two year old decided to flex his vocal muscle and he gave the kids food to feed the fish.  The four of us shared a light dinner of Chicken Lo Mein and the smell was amazing. I enjoyed the thick noodles and super tender chicken; the kids ate so much we got them a second order.   My husband ordered the Hot Girl Roll. Shrimp tempura, raw tuna, some sort of non-seaweed wrap and a sweet sauce that goes great w/wasabi. The ginger, god bless 'em, was fresh. No pink stuff here! Nice, fresh, pungent, delicious, white ginger. My husband really, really enjoyed the roll and both kids begged for more.   We are looking fwd to returning to try more entrees. Hopefully, the next server will be a little more on his/her game and we'll bump them up to a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pad thia and it was horrible! The noodles were plain and had no flavor at all. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"From the start I was VERY down with the ambiance of this gem in a quiet shopping center. They've got a great warm and cozy set up inside, accenting blue lights around the top of the bar, cool staff and a Japanese koi pond at the front where you can pick your fish...kidding! But they do have some colorful koi in a big indoor fountain/pond which adds to the mood here.  Prices aren't bad for the area. Compared to Osaka up the street I'd recommend this joint. That's not to say Osaka isn't a close second. But here they have half-off Tuesdays for their standard maki rolls. And for a change up from my usual Wednesday night visits to Edomae way down by Northlake Mall, this is a good find. One dish I was particularly intrigued by was what I think was called the Volcano Roll. It's a bunch of cut roll sections standing on end and topped with a spicy explosion of sauces and shredded meats from the sea. Very good! Also, this is the first Japanese restaurant I've found to serve the Sapporo Gold beer. It's a much-loved change up as well.  Staff is friendly and as is typical of me I find myself sitting at the sushi bar chatting with the chef and the servers. I've already been a few times and I'll definitely be a big regular in here. Can't wait to hit it again - just thinking of it makes me hungry!"}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm, we were the only customers. Ten minutes later another table arrived.  We were the only two tables our entire meal.  They were out of the first two drinks that we ordered.  Our order finally arrived 30 minutes after we ordered and 10 minutes after the other table (who ordered after us and had more food).  The Kung Pao chicken was flavorful but not spicy at all.  We also had the godzilla & salmon sushi which were average.  The empty restaurant should have been our first clue.  Our server did deduct $10 for the late meal, so cudos to her."}
{"text":"I never would have known about this place if not for Groupon.  And I enjoyed my first visit so much that I've already been back!  Peninsula China Bistro is tucked away in the Harris Teeter shopping center off Jetton Road, right across from Alton's Kitchen.  When you walk in, you notice the bold red decor - it's certainly eye-catching!  We were seated in a comfortable booth near the sushi bar.  Our server was both friendly and helpful.  For our appetizers, we tried the shrimp wonton soup, hot-and-sour soup, and pork pot stickers.  All were very good.  For our entrees, my hubby had the Peninsula Noodle, substituting rice noodles for the egg noodles that the dish usually came with.  The sauce was light and flavorful, and not at all too salty.  We both loved it (I'll admit, I snagged a few bites when he wasn't looking!).  I had the Yummy Roll.  It was large in size and portion (eight pieces), filled with crab, (sadly, the fake kind), cream cheese and topped with lightly cooked salmon and a spicy sauce.  Despite having fake crab, it was absolutely dynamite!  While a little pricey at $12.95, that didn't keep me from returning a week later on my own to get it again!     PCB certainly has a large menu with lots of choices.  I honestly think its the best Chinese/Japanese restaurant in the LKN area, and I know I'll be back again soon for that Yummy Roll!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for good Chinese food in the Lake Norman area for the past 2 years and somehow only tried Peninsula China Bistro last night. The General Tso's Chicken was excellent and the Peninsula Fried Rice was good as well.  I am Taiwanese and from California where there is a ton of top notch Chinese food so my standards are pretty high (hence 4 stars). However, I think we finally found our go-to Chinese food place. What a relief!"}
{"text":"Ohhh not good. We had seen this place when we moved south but it was closed. Then we saw the grad opening. The inside is just beautiful. Then we did take out. Yikes. It was like a wad of rice noodle with a small portion of Thai sauce. The soup was not better and the lo mein was not up to par. Plenty of quantity but I would rather have less and have it taste good. I was so excited as we do like good Chinese  but as far as this place, we will not be back."}
{"text":"I live in Cornelius and this is one of our favorite places to eat. They closed for renovations and said they would reopen in late October. As of this writing, they are still not open so not sure if they will reopen or not?! So bummed."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently when near the Peninsula. Great quality Asian food. Sushi is fresh and Wok dishes have excellent flavor and consistency. I typically get seafood dishes...plump scallops and large prawns. Definitely recommend if you are in the area. Jasmine tea is good too."}
{"text":"We headed over to Peninsula with a Groupon in hand to try out yet another of Cornelius' sushi eateries. While there are slightly better sushi restaurants in the Lake Norman area, Peninsula is still pretty high on the list and I'm sure that we will be back there again when desiring a change in pace from our regular haunts.  We went in at around 6:30 on Saturday to find the place surprisingly dead, with only two other tables seated. I really like the interior, which has a lot of black with red seats. It gives a visual pop and makes it feel sleek and new. There is plenty of private space between the tables and the music is low and classy, giving the whole place a slight intimate feel.   I was a bit taken back by the alcohol choices. They don't serve flavored sake by the carafe, just the big bottles. That's just too much booze for just my wife and I, and I don't want to be springing for a big bottle. They also do not have any beer on draft, as the \"Sapporo Draft\" I ordered came in a bottle anyway.   The menu consists of a mixture of sushi and Chinese dishes like General Tsao and that bunch. We stuck to the sushi, though we did start with a serving of boiled potstickers ($4.95.)  They were nothing too fancy yet still yummy, with a nice pork filling. I also liked the sweet dipping sauce that came with them.   As for the sushi rolls, we opted for the Yummy Roll ($12.95) , Sweetie Roll ($12.95) and Yellowtail Roll ($5.95.) The Yummy Roll was my favorite and consisted of seared salmon with other filling. The seared salmon really gave the roll an almost smokey flavor which was excellent. What really did it for me was the sauce. The roll was covered in this sweet sauce that really worked well with the fish. Normally I wouldn't like the idea of sweet and sushi, but this one had it down pat. The only thing we didn't like about it was that it lacked any kind of texture, making it pretty mushy. A couple of panko crumbs or something else inside would have made this the ultimate roll for me.  The Sweetie Roll was mainly some spicy tuna which had the perfect spice level for sushi. This one was topped with some of the panko and also had cream cheese inside, making it a slightly elevated version of a Phili Roll. It was pretty dang good, and my wife's favorite roll of the night.  To keep our costs down our third roll was a regular ol' Yellowtail Roll. Nothing fancy about this one, just yellowtail fish wrapped in seaweed. It had a nice fresh taste to it and was wrapped up tightly, and really let you see the core skills of the sushi chef.  When it was all said and done, Peninsula China Bistro will definitely remain as one of our top sushi spots. While we still prefer Sushi @ The Lake the ambiance of Peninsula blows it away, and the sushi is almost as good. It would be a good place to take visiting family and friends if you wanted to give them a somewhat fancier experience but didn't feel like springing for Eez."}
