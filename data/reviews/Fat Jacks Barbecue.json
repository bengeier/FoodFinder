{"text":"In July 2013, I was staying at the Country Inn down the street, and figured I'd walk to dinner in the area. I had my heart set on another restaurant.

THEN I SMELLED BARBECUE.

I literally followed my nose, and ended up at Fat Jack's. I was traveling alone, and the experience was phenomenal. Good food and great staff. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but once inside, they have a ton of memorabilia around. I've been there several times since (I'm from Chicago, so I'm not up that often), but it is my go-to if I'm riding I-90 through the area.

If you're feeling ambitious and/or want leftovers the next day, go for their sampler platter. It has all their barbecue and is more than enough for 2 meals. There's two different kinds of sauces on the table, mild and spicy. 

I went here last Friday, 8/1/14, with my boyfriend for lunch. As we got out of our car, an older gentleman told us how good it was. And right he was!

I wish Fat Jack's was nearer so we could go more often!"}
{"text":"Went to Fat Jacks for the first time in years and was expecting the same mouth watering ribs I had in the past. It was approx. 6:00pm. We decided on the Tuesday special - all you can eat chicken and ribs. When our food arrived both the chicken and the ribs were very dried out as if they were under a heat lamp for 8 hours. They were edible but far from mouth watering. I decided not to eat the chicken because of the dryness and focused on the ribs. Requested more ribs three times and it was not until the third small plate of small ribs did I receive mouth watering, tender ribs I was expecting from Fat Jacks. What a disappointment. I would not recommend Fat Jacks. Service was 3-4 stars but food was a 2 stars."}
{"text":"Fat Jacks was one of my first post-college places that I frequented as it was a big favorite among the people that I worked with.  I love BBQ, particularly pulled pork and Fat Jack's delivered for several years as I rarely strayed away from their pork platter, which I usually took with garlic bread and fries.  Combine their mild sauce, which they warn you is in the biggest bottle, and a Dr. Pepper, which should be sold at all good BBQ places, and that was a terrific combination of tastes.   My friend at the time would complain if they moved from shredded to sliced pork, as they tended to bounce between the two, but I was usually a very satisfied customer. 

Fast forward 15 years.  I come back to Madison about twice a year and usually that includes a trip to Fat Jack's, which has probably become more for nostalgia than for the food.   My family and I went this summer and afterwards, I decided that it was time for me to write my first review. 

Fat Jack's totally has the look and feel of a Wisconsin styled supper club.  It's a log cabin interior with booths and tables.   They write their specials on a little white board that you see as you walk in, and as you look to the left, you'll see beer bottles from practically every Wisconsin micro brewery that you can think of, even ones that don't exist anymore.  The staff is friendly, though usually green with the turnover of kids that look high school and college ages.  They have cool Wisconsin paraphernalia all over the walls.  

Before I write a novel, let me get to the food and drink.  They have spotted cow on tap.   That's a huge bonus.   The only complaint I'd have in that regard is that they serve it in tiny glasses, which I can take down in 3-4 sips.   I ordered my pork platter, which starts with a trip to the salad bar.  It's nothing to write home about, but a typical salad bar with fairly bland, uninteresting veggies that you can drown in dressing and sun flower seeds. It's a salad bar.  The fries are thick and tasty.  The garlic bread is not bad, but a little dry.   The pork itself was nice and tender in parts, but parts of it were overcooked, so I ended up eating about 80% of it.   I didn't have any soup, but typically their soups are very good.

That's been my usual experience the last 5 years or so and after this last visit, I began to wonder if I should start thinking about other BBQ options from now on.  Famous Dave's may actually be better and I need to try Smoky John's.   

My rating as a young graduate would probably be 5 stars.  Now that I've become a seasoned veteran of eating, I'm sad to do this, but I have to give it 3 stars.   If yelp had another half star I could give, I'd probably do that, but 4 stars is too much."}
{"text":"In town for business, searching yelp and came across Fat Jacks. Gave me a hankering for some BBQ so decided to swing by.

The inside has a cozy, down-home kind of feel that I really liked. My waitress was friendly and attentive. I had the sampler which included smoked beef, pulled pork, and spareribs (you can devise your own sampler) - and it was delicious.

The food tastes like it was pulled fresh off a smoky campfire, just very 'authentic' for lack of a better word.... many BBQ places either have too little smoke or it tastes like it is doctored up with liquid smoke flavoring, but not Fat Jacks.

They don't do much to the meat besides the smoking, it was very tender and they house BBQ sauce was a nice addition, but they leave that up to you. When it is served, the meat speaks for itself. The ribs do have some kind of seasoning applied, but they were very good as well.

I would recommend to anyone in the area who is looking for some good BBQ."}
{"text":"I ate here last week,  this was my first time to Fat Jack's and likely the last. The place is quite dingy and has this layer of dusty grime on everything, it is in need of one of those restaurant makeover shows. The wait staff was friendly but unprofessional and somewhat inattentive given that there were few other people there at the time. It is a windowless, dark, cave atmosphere and dimly lit. 

My food was Just OK and for a $10 sandwich they could have done allot better, it had zero flavor, but they provide home made BBQ sauces in those on-table, refillable squeeze bottles that never see a fridge or dishwasher. This place is in need of some serious updating in ALL areas."}
{"text":"i travel a lot and no matter what city i find myself in, i make sure to hit up a bbq spot at least once during the trip. each and every one of those visits are compared to my bbq gold standard, fat jack's in monona. 

i'm actually leaving on sunday for yet another trip and i can say, without fail, on bbq night, one of my travel buddies at the table will ask, \"so... how'd it compare to fat jack's?\"

chances are my response will be something like, \"it's good... but it ain't fat jack's!\""}
{"text":"Used to eat lunch here every Wednesday for their Jambalaya lunch special and this was always a fun and enjoyable atmosphere with colleagues to eat lunch at."}
{"text":"Fat Jack's is a barbecue place. It is known for its barbecue. Last Friday night, I did not go for the barbecue. I went for a fish fry. No, that is not really true. I went for the Cajun Potato soup, but more on that later.

Do not get me wrong about why I was at Fat Jack's. I love all types of barbecue. But this is Wisconsin and it was Friday night. Most of the Wisconsin population will go out for fish on Friday night, not all, but most do. We were with friends and the vote was for fish. Fat Jack's was close and we had not been there for some time. And our friends were never there, so we pulled into Fat Jack's.

We all ordered the Friday Night Fish Fry. One thing I like about their Fish Fry is you can get their steak fries or their beans or Red Rice and Beans as a side. The four of us tried them all and all the sides were all good. The fish was done well with not too much batter, a trait I like in a Fish Fry. Their coleslaw is very good, but I would like more with my fish. Overall, Fat Jack's has a very good Wisconsin Friday Night Fish Fry.

Now really why I was at Fat Jack's and that was for their Cajun Potato soup. It is just marvelous. I could just stop for the soup. It is spicy, but not overbearing. There are chunks of potato and the soup is thick, but not too thick. It has the color of toast that is not too dark. The taste is just great. Order a bowl and you will want more. The Cajun Potato soup is definitely five star."}
{"text":"Unique combinations and super easy to work with!  Made me a meal on request and made a group of guys very happy!"}
{"text":"I am digging the sauce. Brisket is amazing. If you order root beer here it comes in a big frosted mug. Lots of cool stuff from Wisconsin on the walls."}
{"text":"I drove by this place many times...looking at the all-you-can-eat tue and thur meals.  Well I finally took the bait.  As I entered the place, I was surprised with amount of items on the walls...I thought it was in good taste, but I am sure others will find it tacky.  The food was above average but not the best I have ever had.  The chicken was smokey and moist...the ribs were good, but a few on the dry side.  Waitstaff very nice and attentive.  Great night...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Barely OK. Service was flat out terrible. It's always bad when your server throws another server under the bus for taking 5 minutes to get service after sitting down...not impressed. Service throughout the meal was extremely slow and it took 30 minutes to just get our food (for 2 people). 

The food is OK. Not even close to the best in Madison. The ribs were very dry and tough. The flavor of the rub was good however. The BBQ sauce on the table was also very good. 

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"All you can eat smoked chicken on Sunday's is why we go all the time. It is such good tasting and tender chicken all the time and the price is right. They also service spotted cow beer on tap which is a plus. And we have ALWAYS had great friendly service there."}
{"text":"I love this place!

My son and I were driving back from the Wisconsin Dells and decided to pull off for lunch and we found Fat Jacks on my GPS.

The outside of the place isn't very impressive, but some of the best bbq places I've ever been to have been dumps.  The inside is much nicer, decorated with local Wisconsin artifacts and pictures.  My favorite was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance.

Anyway, we got sat and our waitress came over right away....super friendly and super nice lady.  We asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great, and after eating there, I believe her.

I ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry.  When she brought over the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was sooo much food! 

My son's fish was very good, not greasy but light and flaky.  My pork was excellent.  The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce, I love spicy, so she brought it.  Excellent!  Smokey, spicy flavor.  The sauces on the table were really good too.

If you are looking for some good, casual, non-pretentious BBQ, Fat Jack's is the place for you!  Don't let the outside fool you, the inside is clean and the food is excellent and they give you a ton of it!"}
{"text":"Recently got back to Monona after an 11 yr absence. First stop is Fat Jack's. Was there when they opened over 30 yrs ago, and have enjoyed every meal. Did not disappoint this time either. First plate of all you can eat ribs and chicken tends to be my last. Good food, friendly effective staff. Perfected over 3 decades!"}
{"text":"This past 4th of July, I hit  the Monona 4th of July Celebration in the Winnequah Park that a number of food kiosks set up. Not feeling in the mood for the typical brat, hot dog or hamburger selection, I decided on the offerings at the Fat Jack's table under the tent. They had jambalaya and a pork sandwich. The jambalaya was excellent, hot with heat and with the right amount of spice, with nice chunks of vegetables and meat. The pork had the black crust on the outside that you look for when you are looking for barbecue.  I was most happy, decided then and there to check out the restaurant. Dad and I went there for lunch. Dad got the special, which was chicken and meatballs over biscuits, and I got the combo lunch platter, where I chose the pork ribs and sliced pork with beans and cole slaw on the side. The cole slaw was homemade, as were the beans. The pork was delicious, needing only a small amount of the mild sauce to give it a little kick. Include with both meals was a large slice of crusty garlic bread. The place was very clean, including the bathrooms, without the sticky table syndrome that you get in some barbecue places. The iced tea was not chemical tasting and the waitress was attentive and pleasant. The only drawback was that the music was cranked a little loud, but all and all, a very pleasant place to have lunch if you are in the mood for barbecue. Apparently, they serve the jambalaya for their Wednesday special. We will be back."}
{"text":"The meat was dry but plentiful.  The service was good. But without good food... I won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved it. We found it from my Yelp app on my iPhone while we were in Madison. Awesome ribs and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich and it was also really good. 

Ask the server for the hot BBQ sauce if you're a fan of spicy since they don't put it on the table."}
{"text":"Normally, their food and service is great.  However, we ate there on February 18th 2012 and had anything but, that!  We saw people who got there after us, being waited on like kings and got their food, drinks and their bill before us.  I ordered the half chicken (which was more like two small pieces of chicken) and in towards the bone, there was blood...BLOOD!  Not pink or even a smoke ring, blood.  Not cool.  They were busy (which is great) but they could not handle it.  Our server got our drinks and took our order, other than that, we never saw her again.  I was about to get up and ask another serer for our bill.  We will give them another chance, as we've eaten there many time before.  However, if the next visit is like this one, I will find another place to take my money!"}
{"text":"OK, BBQ sauces were pretty mild and brisket was dry. Service was goods and sides were tasty."}
{"text":"It had been years - but a friend and I recently went back for lunch. We both got the 'special' which really wasn't special. BBQ chicken on top if rice, with corn and some bread. Rice was good, but everything else was very blah. Kind of pricey too for a special and for lunch. I'll probably try again, but nothing from this visit is making me want to go back soon."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for 25 years. It used to my favorite place for barbecue. I ordered a half rack of ribs and the bones were soft and tasted awful. The waitress took it back to the cook. The cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib. I won't be going back sad to say."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time with part of the family and once again it was delicious.  This place reminds me of a place back home in Michigan that we go to get our fill of comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is great pretty good bbq and great service even the slaw is good( I don't usually like that stuff). I usually go for the all you can eat chicken and ribs and usually wind up tapping out after a plate and a half still worth it!"}
{"text":"We had Fat Jack's catered for our wedding. The staff was professional and wonderful to work with. The food was delicious. Price was great, very affordable. I'd highly recommend them for any catered event you need!"}
{"text":"Not a very exciting place on a Friday night, but we didn't have much of a choice since downtown was packed. We were too hungry to wait 1+ hours for any seats.

So Fat Jacks it is!

Service wasn't the best, but not the worst. It took a while for someone to acknowledge me standing by myself in front of the hostess booth. When we were seated, our server introduced herself but didn't come back for a while to take our order. We even contemplated leaving, but alas, she arrived. She was very nice though, so there's that.

Food was mediocre. The cod special was lackluster--even the tartar sauce I had to dip it in didn't give it much flavor. So I settled for smothering it in ranch. When in doubt, right? The fries lacked seasoning also. Into the ranch it went swimming. 

My husband kind of liked his bacon burger he made. It was well done instead of the medium he requested. Same thing for our friend who ordered a steak. But I guess there was some flavor that made up for it.

We might consider coming back here since our friends talked about the BBQ ribs. Maybe."}
{"text":"How I love Fat Jacks!  I would give it 5 stars, but it really isn't in that upper echelon of BBQ restaurants (like Smoky Jons).

ANYWAY, the food here is really good, and they have 2 house sauces.  A sweet and tangy milder sauce, and a spicier sauce that tastes kind of like old bay seasoning, or bay leaves or something.  I really like the spicier sauce, and I wish they sold it by the bottle.

They have a good fish fry, their steaks and chicken are also good.  The ribs can sometimes be slightly tough, but that's not normally the case.

I love the decor and the true air of \"Wisconsin\" from the staff to the usual patrons.  When I am there sitting in all that wood paneling, it's a nice cozy feeling.

Go on sunday nights for the all you can eat BBQ chicken dinner for $7.50.  It's a total deal, and the people watching is awesome."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Food was barely tolerable and the place was so dirty. Waitress stood in the middle is the dining area loudly babbling about movies for 10 minutes annoying everyone. Never  going back."}
{"text":"Best of Madison 2015?  Not so much.  

I order the Pork Dinner which came with the salad bar, a choice of side and garlic bread. It was a great value for the price. The pork portion was huge. I chose the fries, which were supposed to be ranch fries. I am not sure if that meant the cut or the seasoning but they were just normal fries. The salad bar was simple, tasty, but nothing outstanding. Now the garlic bread, that was amazing. I kind of wish I had the option for all you can eat bread. The pork was tender and delicious. I paired it with the hot barbecue sauce on the table. 

This place is good, but it is not amazing. The service was awesome. Very attentive and the interior is comfortable. It is simple and welcoming."}
{"text":"The BBQ sauce was excellent and the lunchtime portions were a good size. They serve just the meat and I had to add the sauce at the table which is fine for me. Service was quick and polite and we were in and out within 30 minutes of being seated. 
I am not crazy about the hickory smokiness of the neat but with the sauce it was a great meal."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good place overall.  I'm usually not the largest BBQ fan, but I was pretty happy with my meal.  I got the ribs, which were good.  Nothing knock your socks off, but still good.  The salad bar was decent.  The service was great."}
{"text":"Pretty much AYCE nights only is time I venture here. BBQ chicken is especially good and the ribs (spare ribs - not baby backs)  sides etc are pretty tasty as well. Like the dry rub and sauce on side. Yeah,  the interior is dated we did it ourselves vintage  WI  but so what - i come for the food. Staff is generally good - they hustle the food out and keep it coming - it's not 5 star dining  but it's good BBQ ."}
{"text":"The Cajun cheese curds didn't have a \"Cajun\" flavor.  Also, I know cheese curds are deep fried, but these were beyond greasy.  So greasy, the breading was falling off, and some of the cheese had disappeared. 

Disappointing there were only two bbq sauce options.  I've been to many BBQ places in the South, and they always have more than two options. 

I ordered the \"all you can eat\" ribs.  The first order was phenomenal.  Lots of meat on the bone, and tender. 

The reorders were pitiful.  They had to of been a different batch of ribs or leftovers from the day prior.  They barely had any meat on the bone, and they were crisp and very tough to eat. 

Also, the sever progressively got slower and slower with each reorder.  The place wasn't even busy.

The coleslaw was some of the worst I've ever had.  Usually coleslaw has a sweet flavor or a vinegar flavor.  It just tasted like pepper."}
{"text":"Fat Jack's is a good, but not great BBQ joint.

I always enjoy BBQ and Fat Jack's is just fine. The portions were good, the service was pleasant, and we all left full and satisfied. The tacky, redneck decor is a lot of fun and seems more like a collection over time than a place trying real hard to look like an old BBQ joint. 

I ordered the rib basket lunch special. This included about 5 St. Louis style ribs, coleslaw, garlic bread and the waitress let me have fries and bbq beans lowering the quantity of each so that I could try them both. The sides were average - nothing stands out here. But who cares, right it's all about the meat!

Ribs were very flavorful, had a good crust and the smoke was prominent without being over-powering. They weren't the meatiest and a bit dry, but I cleaned the bones well enough. They leave the membrane on the bottom of the ribs which is sort of a BBQ rookie mistake, but some people like it (and I ate it anyway).

They have two BBQ sauces - one sweet and one spicy. The spicy was superior - a kind of one-note Kansas City style with a distinct black pepper flavor. It wasn't terribly complex, but we sure did enjoy it.

I would give Fat Jack's a solid 4 stars, however...

Their beef is a disappointment and why I'd consider a different BBQ joint rather than returning here. Instead of offering brisket their sliced beef is eye of round. In my mind a BBQ restaurant that doesn't serve brisket is like a steakhouse that doesn't serve ribeye. Typically, I judge a BBQ joint on how well they serve up brisket. Not even possible here.

Everyone in my party was happy with what they ordered and we got our fill, but if I'm in the area again I'll be looking to try a different place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Thursday with my family of 4. I was a little torn between rating a 4 and a 5, but the outstounding service made it an easy call. Our waitress, Nina, was the nicest server I have ever had, and she was also extremely attentive/helpful. We all decided to get the special because it was such a deal, and it did not let us down. The ribs were tender and flavorful (they come glazed with sauce on the table), the chicken was juicy, the coleslaw was a tangy,homemade type, and the garlic bread was of artisan quality. If you are looking to go out for dinner on Tuesday or Thursday, the all you can eat ribs and chicken is way too good to pass up. 13.95 for the meal, and the staff is very attentive on reorders + the food was great quality."}
{"text":"My daughter just said: \"The beans: the reason I don't order the French fries.\""}
{"text":"Fat Jacks has the best beer battered fried everything! Loved the blackened catfish as well! Can't wait to visit there again!!!"}
{"text":"Not good at all. I had pork and brisket. Meat was dry and sauce was not to my liking. Service was slow. I also had the beans. They were not bad. Prob would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"don't listen to all the clueless northerners commenting here about lack of sauce or not fall off the bone tender etc.  Fat Jacks cooks AUTHENTIC SOUTHERN STYLE SMOKED FOOD!  Their pork spare ribs come with a dry rub.  so NO SAUCE.  The wonderful sauces are on the table for the customer to put on themselves.

Plus, any respectable southerner knows that ribs are NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SLOPPY FALL OFF THE BONE TENDER!  There's supposed to be a little bite to them.

LOVE Fat Jacks.  Always have!"}
{"text":"Fat Jacks is simply amazing. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. Food is really flavorful. They have daily specials that are totally worth it. All you can eat days are amazing. 

Must Try: the Garlic Bread, blackened Burger and of course, the BBQ. 

And They Cater! We had them cater out wedding and they did a phenomenal job. Everybody loved it! Vegetarians, pescatarians, and the carnivores. The Food was great and affordable. They set up and deliver everything you need."}
{"text":"Loud ventilation fan overhead. Lighting the fireplace would have provided better ambiance and heat, it was cold inside. Meat was cooked well. Bbq sauce however was just ok. Coleslaw had a great flavor but looked like it was made with a slap chop from a tv commercial vs shredded. This place could easily be a 5 with some much needed DIY improvements."}
{"text":"Meat is a little dry, spareribs are good. The sauces aren't that great. Try a bourbon sauce or a more tangy style sauce. The salad bar, 1 trip, for $5.50 is pretty expensive. Had to give the place a shot but I'm not impressed. Service was good though!"}
{"text":"I came to Fat Jacks a few times when I was a kid, so I always had good vibes associated with it whenever I drove past. My high expectations fell short when I visited recently, but overall I was satisfied with the meal.

I had an order of ribs from Fat Jacks that was very tasty, although there could have been more to it. I measure quality based on whether I could have made the meal at home myself, and in the ribs case I felt as though I could come close to it. That being said, the meal left me happy that I stopped in, and I enjoyed the leftovers I saved the following day.

Service is good, seating is adequate, and the decor reminds me of a northern Wisconsin supper club, albeit a little bit condensed. I'd recommend going, but it might be my second recommendation (rather than my first) to someone visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Dry chicken with unseasoned potato wedges, Yuck. The ribs were smoked way to long, dry and they had way to much smoke flavor.  What's up with the red wine vinegar on the coleslaw without mayo or sour cream. The owner needs to go to Texas and find out how to improve his BBQ.  However the the fried mushrooms were good."}
{"text":"Barbecue was top notch at this Madison area gem. The chicken and spare ribs were full of flavor as evidenced by the thick smoke ring. The sauces complimented the meat very well and the apple vinegar cole slaw was one of the best I've ever eaten. This will be on list of places to stop on my travels to Wisconsin."}
{"text":"The surroundings are a little dated...even if that's the intent, it's too dark.   Service was very good and fast.   I had the BBQ chicken.  It was tasty, but dry.  It was a late lunch \"1pm\", and it's hard to keep chicken moist.  If they would work on that it would earn another star.   Otherwise, I would come back"}
{"text":"We would highly recommend Fat Jacks for catering your party. We used Fat Jacks in 2012 for a party and were so happy with everything that we decided to use them again this year. Everyone raved about how good everything was and the price was very fair."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST BBQ restaurant I have ever been to!

I tried Fat Jacks for the first time after living in Monona for over a year.  I ordered the buffalo wings and a half rack of pork back ribs.  The wings were very dry and bland.  They were fried but had no seasoning and were very greasy.  They also were extremely small yet still cost $8 for 8 wings.  

The ribs were a good portion and had a good amount of BBQ sauce lathered on.  I was excited until I tried them.  The meat was tough and dry.  I was only able to finish half of the ribs before I had enough.  They tasted like they were previously frozen, microwaved, and then lathered in sauce.  They were by far the worst ribs I've ever eaten.  To the point that I couldn't even finish them.

The biggest issue I had was the price.  I don't mind having low quality BBQ for a cheap price (even though a lot of great BBQ is reasonably priced).  This was very expensive and, again, was the worst I've ever had.  I now understand why the parking lot at Fat Jacks is empty at dinner time every single night.  I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here almost a dozen times in less than a year. For smoked meat (pork beef or chicken) they are great-best in the area and very good by any Midwest US standard. Red beans and rice is as good as I've had in New Orleans. But everything else is just awful. For dining in the salad bar is small and really bad. Lettuce is usually iceberg with some mixed greens and all wilted. Dressings are bad by Aldis standards and the side items are lousy. With a small salad bar they should either do excellent traditional or go different (southern? Pickled okra?) because what they have now just stinks. Appetizers have never been good. Lastly and perhaps most sadly their chicken wings are the worst I have ever had in any place from California to New York. Just the very worst. 7-11 would be better. Small, greasy and covered in the worst sauce you could imagine. They should do everyone a favor and drop it from the menu until they get a clue. I live close by, I go here often for the great smoked meat but I've finally learned to stay away and say no thank you to everything else-which is sad. Their limitations are what separates them from average to great and the chasm is easily crossed with some quick changes."}
{"text":"Fat Jack's is a locally owned restaurant who believes in home cooking.  Their chicken is slowly smoked, roasted ribs, and the marinated chicken breast is aw so good.  Their barbecue sauces are made on the premises and is their special secret.  The portion size is good and the atmosphere is comfortable.  

The service is fairly quick and a good pace.  Don't miss a good restaurant with their own distinctive flavors."}
{"text":"My dad and I went here thinking it would be a good place to try. The inside of the restaurant was unclean and tacky. Neither my dad nor I were impressed with the food. We both had ribs. There was very little BBQ sauce on the ribs, and while our food came out fast the quality was not great."}
{"text":"I got the all you can eat spare ribs and chicken.  I tried a chicken leg first and all I could taste was smoke.  The leg and thigh weren't that bad despite the heavy smoke.  The breast was dry.

Next I tried the ribs.  They were tender,but for some reason they tasted like sausage.  Maybe they were smoked with sausage.

The baked beans were pretty good.  They had a hint heat, which is good.

The coleslaw is what hurt.  I could taste apple and it is vinegar based I believe, which I like, but it looked and tasted old. 

Bottom line is I've had better BBQ in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Anyone familiar with Sonny's BBQ (a southern chain) will immediately notice the similarity. This is not a good thing. 
Salad bar was ok. Not a lot of great variety.
I had the 1/2 rack of ribs with slaw and fries. 
The slaw and fries were fine. Nothing special but not bad. 
The garlic bread, soaked in buttery garlic, also was fine. Probably the best part of the meal. 
The ribs, on the other hand, could use some work. 
First, they were covered in SO MUCH SAUCE, that I had to hold them up to let some drip off. Sauce should provide an accent to good BBQ, not be the BBQ.
Second, the doneness of the meat varied across the ribs. One rib was fall of bone. Further down, it was closer to jerky. 

All in all, not a great BBQ experience."}
{"text":"Just had take out. My baby backs were undercooked, and the beans looked and tasted like they came out of a can, without tweaking them at all.
Meh. Won't be doing that again."}
