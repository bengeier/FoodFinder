{"text":"This is the best little gem in all of Phoenix. If you're anywhere in the area, stop on in for a coffee, delicious tea or killer homemade pop tart (Thursday's only). 

My go to is the loose leaf earl grey tea London fog style with almond milk, honey and lavender. To die for!!


Edit--- Poptarts are available all the time! (while supplies last)
So get off your phone/laptop/ipad and go get one!"}
{"text":"Great little find.

We came across this place on a recent walk/ride on Light Rail.  We were on Central Ave & Thomas and exploring the area and were in definite need of a pick me up after a couple hours on our early outing.

Such a cute and quirky little place. Excellent coffee and yummy food in this cozy coffee shop. 

Also, the owner Michela is really a nice person - great great customer  service.

Would definitely recommend you hunt it out!!  The Early Bird Coffee Shop
Southwest corner of Central Ave and Thomas"}
{"text":"Such a lovely spot to grab a drink if you are working at Mod PHX or at the Thomas/Central area. The owner Michela is so friendly and she has her coffee game down. She suggested their honey lavender latte and told me she brings AZ grown lavender from Pine and makes her own lavender honey syrup for the drink. I could not say no to that and, girl, it delivered! The lavender was nicely balanced by the honey and not overpowering or soapy like lavender drinks tend to taste. The drink was the perfect balance of uplifting (coffee) and soothing (lavender honey), Yumm, already dreaming of another one! Also they serve Voyager Bakeshop pastries which are delicious. I tried the strawberry poptart which was generously filled, light and buttery dough balanced with the tart strawberry jam inside. The space is super cute and vibrant, go pay them a visit for your daily coffee."}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to take a picture but this place was really cute and a little hidden. I happened to have walked by the Mod building on the corner of Thomas and central and saw a cute chalk board sign.

Craving coffee, I went inside and the coffee shop was set up along the wall in the shared space building. It's not a full blown coffee shop, rather it's a coffee bar.

They had snacks behind the glass display (including pop tarts) and a decent sized coffee menu. I ordered a Vanilla Cold Brew which was awesome. I spoke with the owner and she let me know that she makes all the syrups in house! She's not a fan of the artificial stuff that goes into those things, which I greatly appreciate.

Also they are only open from 7-Noon (M-F) which is a bit limited."}
{"text":"Thank you, Early Bird, for parking outside my hotel! (Graduate Tempe, fyi)

I was not impressed with the hotel coffee from the day prior and I was subsiding only on the keurig coffee in my room. I had a short wait for the airport shuttle so I happily spent that time ordering a coffee to take with me. The prices were reasonable, the service friendly, and to save the best for last, the coffee was fan-freakin'-tastic! 

As I sipped my coffee with a cream and a shot of caramel on the way to PHX, it was suddenly so much easier to handle the raucous flight attendants who were simply too cheerful early in the morning. Hashtag blessed."}
{"text":"My company rented out space at Mod PHX for the week, and The Early Bird was such a pleasant surprise!

Michela, the owner, and the rest of staff were extremely friendly and always had a smile on their faces! The drinks are delicious, and I highly recommend the honey lavender latte (I was skeptical at first too, but trust me, you won't regret it!). If you don't drink coffee, their teas are amazing too! They have mason jars of gourmet tea leaves that they don't bag until  ordered. There is also a great assortment of snacks and pastries, if you're looking for a small bite to eat. 

If you're ever in the area, STOP BY The Early Bird, because what ever you're in the mood for, they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee!!! Lemonade, tea and Italian sodas! Homemade flavors like Carmel, peach, lavender, honey, and vanilla bean. Also an assortment of locally made pop tarts and scones! I got an iced coffee with soy milk and Carmel. A large comes with 4 shots! What a deal! Definitely will be back to The Early Bird!"}
{"text":"I dont even drink coffee that much but when I got here Michela, the owner, changed my mind. The service was solid and the coffee was bomb. I worked with her while on a company meeting and she took care of our entire team, pretty much on her own. Next time I am in Phoenix this will be my go to coffee spot."}
{"text":"My company rented out Mod PHX for a week and the best part was Early Bird coffee. The owner of Early Bird, Michela, is amazing and creates some of the most delicious coffee and tea drinks around. My favorites were the honey lavender latte, hazelnut mocha, and London Fog.

Michela is not only talented at coming up with creative drinks, but she's the type of person who remembers what your favorite drink is after only ordering once. Thank you for getting all of us through the early mornings (and afternoons...and late afternoons)."}
{"text":"The honey lavender latte (made with AZ lavender) is to die for! They carry GF pastries and Michele is beyond nice! She makes my day-every morning!!!"}
