{"text":"Enjoyed 806 last night with my date! Great atmosphere. Awesome food and drink as well. The patio was also very nice."}
{"text":"Lychee and Green Tea martinis...enough said.   Eagerly awaiting the grand re-opening of this place!"}
{"text":"Very cool place in an old building.  I liked the added touch of votive candles in the corners of the stairs.  While I don't like martini's, (I had a very good desert wine), I tasted a friend's Keylimatini and it was really refreshing!"}
{"text":"give me a long list of different types of martinis, and i'm a happy girl. throw in some couches, a lot of space, places to cozy with your date, and friendly staff at the bar in front, and you might have yourself one of the best places to go in cleveland on a date. or just with your friends. or when you need a good martini. or when you just need a drink after a hard day. or when you want to make out on the couch. WHAT? maybe minus that last one....."}
{"text":"People, look at the name: Martini and Wine Bar. Do not go here expecting it to be a place to catch the Browns game. That being said, if you come in with the right expectations, you will love it!   The interior is really warm and classy. They have a small patio in the summer."}
{"text":"You know, it's tough to argue with a weeknight outing at 806 when the weather is 78 degrees, no humidity, sipping a glass of wine on the outdoor patio.  I can only speak to the wine menu--it's pretty good sized.  Tuesday nights will get you a glass of Pinot Grigio or Merlot for a meager $3.00.  Yep, read it and weep!  What a steal.  Cool indoor vibe that almost reminds me of a mini version of Velvet Tango Room (but that place is in a class all by itself...)  Food looked good but didn't try it.  A great reason to return to 806..."}
{"text":"Dirty glasses, snippy bar tender and extremely small pour when asked for a scotch neat. Asked for more and bartender got extremely rude. Ended up having to pay for a double for the same amount of scotch that would be standard anywhere else. Really used to love going to this bar, it is a shame that we will never be back."}
{"text":"Recently met a PR contact for happy hour here. Loved the ambiance, very lounge-y and intimate.   Great selection of tapas, reds, whites, martinis, full-bar. We shared the meat and cheese platter, which was great. For some reason I was feeling grapes, melon, etc too but they didn't offer a plate. Only drawback.  She got into a Ed Hardy French Bordeaux, and I went with Terrazas, a Chilean Malbec. Their wine glasses were more so rotund goblets, which was another plus.   I almost tried a Chilean Sauvignon Blanc called Casa Lapostolle, but as we later found out our server was new, which explained why she either didn't know or hadn't tried any of the wines I asked about.  So I was boring and went with what I knew, Chateau St. Michelle's Riesling. Next time I'll go for it lol."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to hang out here, before our dinner reservation at Lolita (which is half a block away).  This is the perfect place to hang out and have a few laid back drinks, whether before dinner, or after dinner. Its not too dressy, but you wouldnt be out of place being a little dressed up either.  The menu is pretty extensive - instead of looking through all the liquor and wine, I decided to stick with the cocktails . . . which were amazing. I had a bellini-tini and a pomegranate mojito.  I downed them, literally thinking there was no alcohol in either of my drinks . .  until I got to dinner and realized that they definitely DID have alcohol in them. They were that delicious! And fairly reasonably priced.  The decor of the wine bar is interesting. Perhaps a little off-beat, but nothing off-putting. Antique looking chairs, some animal prints, fireplace, dark wood, old-fashioned bar. It does feel very intimate, and there are little rooms in the back with couches that are very comfortable. This is a great place to chill as a group OR for an intimate date.   I didn't get to try the apps, but I'm not sure I would be going to a place like this for the apps anyway. The drinks are where its at."}
{"text":"Went here during the Tremont Art Walk last Friday for a glass of wine and a quick little something to eat.  Turns out our \"quick little something to eat\" would turn into an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back.  You would think being a \"Martini and Wine Bar\" the waiters would at least know the difference between their Cabs and Merlots... well, they don't.  In fact, I was told by my waiter that \"oh I don't know anything about those wines, and we probably don't even have the ones on the menu.\"  Seriously?!  Makes sense though, since their menus were sticky gross plastic things that you would get at your local greasy spoon breakfast diner... probably haven't even touched the things in about 5 years.  And the music!  Journey and ACDC blasting in a restaurant posing as a upscale dining experience.  What a joke.  Reminded me of my college days back on campus... I was just waiting for karaoke to start up any minute!  After waiting for 15 minutes to put our drink order in, I asked our waiter for a recommendation for a very dry, earthy red (since I couldn't see for myself on the menu)... and he ended up giving me the sweetest red he probably could find with a deep butterscotch undertone.  Gross.  Asked for the quail dish for a small plate.  Oh guess what - they're out of that.  Okay then.. I will take the Hanger Steak - medium rare, with the Parmesan Risotto as the side.  Risotto is supposed to be light and filling... it's so easy to screw up while cooking and after my experience with the waiter and the wine, I was scared to death after I put my order in.  I was rightfully nervous.  What I got back was a VERY rare Hanger Steak with risotto that was completely inedible.  It was seriously a slop of overly cheesy-greasy-crusted with a half-inch of baked cheese crap.  Think of the greasiest hash browns you've ever had.. deep fry them... then mix a ton of greasy cheese into it and slap a ton more cheese on top. That was the risotto I was expected to eat.  And parmesan is naturally salty so the risotto was also overly seasoned!  I wont' even get into all the details over the cheese plate we ordered.  It was mostly stale bread and crackers plus the same portions that 2 oz mouse would eat.  We literally starting laughing at the ratio of cheese to stale crackers on our plate!  The cheese wasn't even existent, and the stuff that was there was overpowered by the gigantic pile of roasted garlic on the plate.  What a mess!  We waited over 30 minutes for our check, and I finally had to get up to go to the bar and ask for it personally.  Our waiter saw me retrieve my own check and thanked the bartender for \"covering that for him,\" rather than apologize to me for his worst service ever.  That's okay - I saw that the waiter was in a deep bro-ish conversation with the buxom blonde in the corner.  No worries, I won't interrupt your swagg, bro.  My husband and I will not be returning to this place.  Ever.  I prefer my wine and martini bars to know a damn thing or two about their wines, and their food to be at least edible.  We're sticking to Market Ave Wine Bar from now on."}
{"text":"Stellar atmosphere and wine, but so-so food...  THE UP-SIDE:  This place is oozing with atmosphere.  It's dark, full of candles and contains several rooms; each with fancy furniture and decoration.  It also features a very cozy outdoor patio with a big, wood-burning fireplace.  The drink menu is fairly extensive and the prices are \"sorta\" reasonable.    This place would be absolutely ideal for a first date over wine.    THE DOWN-SIDE:  The menu, albeit new, is quite limited.  There's just not a lot to choose from.  The cheese plate was less than thrilling and felt more like something you'd throw together at home, than something you'd pay $14 for.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  A true yin and yang kinda thing.  On the one hand, you have stellar atmosphere and a great drink selection.  On the other, you have a decidedly limited and so-so food selection.  In the end, I'd recommend this place to anybody looking to kick back with some good wine on a cozy date."}
{"text":"The bf and I went here once waiting for Lolita to open. We were the only people there and it was so fun and different. We sat in a room all to ourselves that had the animal print furniture. Got a martini or two. Had a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand 806's shtick.  There's something slightly dive bar-y about it yet they seem to want to be known as an upscale establishment?  Although, if that's your bag 806, then you'll need a bartender/wait staff who is competent at waiting on people, i.e., don't ask me if I need any refills on what is clearly a fully filled glass of wine the moment i sit down or ask me to point things out to you on your wine list because you are unfamiliar with what is what.   This place does get points for an awesome patio but other than that, it doesn't seem like it has anything to offer."}
{"text":"i'm a big fan of this place. my husband's band has played here on a few occasions. it's very cozy and has really snazzy yet comfortable furniture to hang out on. it's nice and dark and there are plenty of candles. lots of interesting artwork on the walls.  you could totally snuggle up to your flavor of the month here.  even the patio is cozy and features a beautiful stone fireplace.  the service is great. the martinis are good.   my only complaints are their beer selection is lacking a bit. but, it's a wine bar so i can't really complain too much about that. also, i wish they'd have more of a solid food menu here."}
{"text":"I've been to the 806 many times with friends and typically had a good time. I enjoy the layout of the and the relaxed environment. However this time was a different story.  A group of my friends were there on a Friday night and a couple of my friends mistakenly walked downstairs which they thought was a restroom but was just their storage area. I was having a conversation with one of my friends when this female bartender confronts my one friend questioning why she was downstairs and said it was by mistake. I thought this lady was crazy and needed to back off.  Not even 5 minutes my other friend comes by and the same lady comes again but is even ruder to my friend. Asking her to open up her purse to search her things and I stepped in and told her to back off and give me justification to her questioning. My friend was getting heated and before you know it we almost had a fight. I held my friend back but honestly this women had it coming. I wanted to crack her in the face myself. We eventually left and I later found out from a random person that the lady was the owner! Are you freaking kidding me!  I thought she was drunk or high  by her behavior  and was way out of line to my friends. I also found out they have major problems with drugs and the cops have been there regularly.  That doesn't excuse the treatment to your customers especially being the owner and acting unprofessionally, drunk and trashy. Needless to say I will not be going back there ever again."}
{"text":"This place doesnt even get a star. I was out with some friends on a Friday night for some drinks after hearing such good reviews but this place is a joke. For being first time here, I am disgusted and angry, especially to the woman who accused me of stealing. After making the mistake of heading into the wrong room for the restrooms, I apologized but there is no explanation to the way how I was treated. For starters, you shouldn't point your fingers at a customer and shout in their face. From what I heard from my friend, the woman was the owner of the place. The actions she presented herself was way out of hand and unprofessional. She appeared drunk and made my friend open her purse for a search. Not only was this the case, I believe she was racial profiling us because she said \"you people....\". There were five Asians and one American chick. I would never step foot in this place and I would definitely share this experience to everyone."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago on a Saturday night a couple friends and myself decided to go back to 806 for a couple martinis. Which proceeded to turn into a martini taste test! We tried 9 different drinks and although some tastes aren't for everyone...let's just say we drank till the last drop. The bartenders that night were busy yet attentive. And honestly if one of us decided we weren't happy-they would have fixed it I'm sure.   I think the interior is quite charming. The front bar is cozy as are the rooms upstairs. Sure I am obsessed with the animal print sofas. But they make for great areas to sit with a group of friends or on the zebra sofa on a date. During the summer there is a great side patio to enjoy also! Each time I have been there I have been greeted at some point by the owner-who is ever present and super friendly and always makes you feel at home with her smile:)  Need a good Martini???"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and decor but that's it. Service is spotty to non-existent and unfriendly. Lead bartender was very rough and short despite trying to win her over with a nice tip. Had to practically tackle the server for a drink after sitting with empty glasses for over 30 minutes. No one was clearing away any empties so we had to clear them ourselves.  Very disappointed for the second time in a row."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio and fireplace merits a 5-star rating all on it's own. What a gorgeous set up!  Unfortunately, being cold-as-balls outside doesn't really make for a great patio night, even with a fire. So, indoors we stayed.   I have to admit, if I would have written this review two years ago, I would have easily given 4-5 stars. But, sadly it's gone a little down hill on the inside over the years.   First off, this place was empty on a Friday night, which is never a good sign. I'm not looking to be packed in like sardines with loud music--but it would have been nice to see other groups chatting it up on the couches, enjoying a cocktail and nice company. You know, a good energy, not wet-blanket-city.  Anyways, we picked a couple of couches and looked over the menu. Our waitress admitted to us almost immediately that it was her first night working. She didn't really need to tell us because it was really apparent. She had no knowledge of the menu at-all. If you're going to call yourself a wine bar, you might want to hire people with some experience with vinos. Or maybe at least enough to answer some simple questions. She didn't even know where the martinis were listed on the menu. It was sort of like she was just hired and thrown into the fire with no training. A plus? Well, she was really sweet and pretty attentive.   The decor struck me as a little odder than I remembered. Lots of gorgeous antiques items mixed with weird art deco... it felt like 806 was suffering from an identity crisis. It didn't help their cause that the music situation was awful. Picture someone at the bar controlling their iPod and switching the songs halfway through to random, early 2000's alt rock music (think adult contemporary... see also: hell.) Not cool.   The space itself is gorgeous, the cocktails were tasty and the wine list is great. This is just one of those instances where our experience was murder-balled simply from atmosphere and service alone. I don't think this will keep me from returning, but it will certainly not make this a top place to visit on my list."}
{"text":"Yup...Great place for a date and for happy hour, even in the Winter this place is fun to go. In the Summer the patio is open and while not huge still tons of fun!  Dress is eclectic...Everything from jeans to cocktail dresses and wedding parties, it's quite a kitsch place to get to after dinner or a show.... Happy hour is a pain in the ass anywhere you go in Cleveland when it's nice so consider yourself warned..."}
{"text":"One of my fav happy hour spots.  The mojitos are fantastic. I get them sugar free! Booze and sugar do not mix well with me! I even eat the mint.  The service is always attentive. I have not eaten but the cheese plate looks great.  Happy hour end at 8:06 pm.  The patio is great !"}
{"text":"806 is adorable!  The wine is wonderful.  The bartenders hot.  The atmosphere is cozy.  This is definetely a great date place or just a nice place to catch up with some friends.  Lago's around the corner was great for dinner after appetizers at 806.  806 could use a little bigger dessert menu."}
{"text":"Just call me Negative Nellie with all these bad reviews I've been writing.  I've been to 806 in the past and liked it.  I've had fun there.   I've heard about all their drug troubles and decided to try it anyways.   I barely made it in the door.  Not cause I didn't want to.  But there was this massive human being blocking it.  He looked like a Jersey shore version of Popeye.  He was surrounded by similar looking friends.  The whole place looked like a fist pumping reunion was about to start.  I'm just not that cool.  So my group just left."}
{"text":"Was there on a Friday night. This place really does not have it together - there wasn't enough wine menus, nor enough staff, and I got served a wine in a filthy lipstick stained glass. And the music was a bit too loud."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!Great atmosphere, music, staff, cocktails.  Not to mention the best patio in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I find myself struggling to find words for 806. Although I had a perfectly delightful time there, it seems to defy normal descriptors.   The Expected:  It's a bar. So...there's a bar. And it's a pretty respectable one at that; comfortable, unpretentious, well stocked.   The Unexpected:  * A lounge area complete with overstuffed chairs and animal print sofas.  * A stone paver patio complete with fireplace that is TO DIE!  * Tapas selection that's more than suitable for any mid-drink munchie requirements and perfect for sharing on a date. (Not to mention, pretty darn tasty.)  * Wait and bar staff who's so willing to promote the place that they'll offer up random martini samples and a free crock of mashed potatoes (that I suspect is laced with the culinary version of crack).   The Conclusion:  I'm totally going back; at least once again just for dinner, once just for drinks and lounging, and definitely once in the fall to enjoy a nice glass of red wine next to a crackling fire on the rockin' patio.   It's definitely worth a try...if only to see if you can come up with some normal descriptors."}
{"text":"On a much needed girls-night-out, my friend and I huddles into 806 on a Saturday night after finding Treehouse was too packed. As soon as we walked in, it felt like we stepped out of 2012 and into a genuine speakeasy and were very pleased with this. However, it only took a few minutes for that happy, cozy, swanky energy to go terribly terribly wrong.   For one, there was no clear drawn style between the bartenders. One was dressed in a sophisticated black button up, the other was dressed like a  dive bar beer slinger, and the last was a hipster chick. No disrespect to any of these styles as they all looked nice, its just that none of it fit what was going on with the rest of the bar. There was no flow whatsoever. So you don't really know what you're supposed to be expecting from this place. That might seem unimportant but it just left me confused, and it was the first shift in what became a weird weird vibe.  The menu itself looks very badly put together and cheap and on my menu, there was no white wine list and when I had to get up from my table and order from the bar (bad!), the menu at the bar was put together completely different which made finding my selection harder and holding up the people behind me.   We ordered two dirty martini's from the bartender and they asked us what kind of vodka we wanted. I said Smirnoff because it was advertised as only 8$ for a Smirnoff martini and that was the only question about my drink. Taking it back to my table, my friend and I had to literally choke them down as they tasted so rancid. It took over our conversations because of just how much we could not believe how bad they were. We couldn't even finish them! So we go and get our check (which was in a timely manner) and see that not only did they charge me for Ciroc which was an upcharge of 3.00,, they charged us an extra 2.00 for getting our martini's UP when they never asked us if we wanted them up! Bringing our what was supposed to be 8$ martini's to 13$! We were upset but just wanted to get the heck out of there as soon as possible. What had started as a swanky, 20's feel energy complete with old jazz music, had changed to a very odd mix of crowd and pounding club music, complete with unfriendly staff and crappy drinks.   SAVE your money, SAVE your time for a bar that actually know who they are!"}
{"text":"This was the most comfortable, cozy bar experience I've ever had. Maybe a bit too comfortable, considering the astonishing rate at which my wife carelessly slurped down dirty martinis. (I can hear her vomiting in the bathroom as I'm writing this review the next morning.)   The back rooms of this wine & martini bar felt like the catalog pages of the Ralph Lauren Brothel Collection. We slid deep into a leather couch in front of the gorgeous, antique metal fireplace, and we never moved for 3 whole hours while the kindly waitress brought us a steady procession of drinks. Next time, I'm going to arrive here in my robe and slippers.   I think you would have to be insane NOT to bring a date here. I don't know where you live, dearest reader, but I would venture to say that 806 Wine Bar is way more conducive to your getting laid than your shitty Parma duplex with the foosball table in the formal dining room."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Charming decor. Amazing martinis.   This place is perfection.  And just being here makes me feel cooler - which certainly doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"This is only a block away from my house and have only been here a couple of times. I should be going here a lot more. This is a good place to bring a date. Other than that, I probably wouldn't have much use for it. Not a good place to drink alone or with rowdy friends. The drinks are good. The beer list is sufficient. I drank some fancy martinis because I figured that is what the place is known for. The Grape Agape and the Raspberry Limeade were both really good. The interior of the bar is great. It feels like you are relaxing at a really nice house. I will make a better effort to start going here more often."}
{"text":"Very nice wine bar that offers a great selection of all types of wines and martinis. They tend to be the normal price range and very good (strong!). The owner of the bar is often around and is very friendly. This is a nice place to go on a date or with a group who likes the atmosphere of a martini bar."}
