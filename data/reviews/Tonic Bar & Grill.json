{"text":"Went on a Saturday night to have a drink and some wings with friends while attending a conference across the street at the Westin. They were out of wings, and oddly sat us upstairs by ourselves when there were plenty of seats available downstairs.   The food was decent and decently priced. Our waitress was much too casual, though - she dropped the F-bomb a few times and complained about her coworker being pregnant. We watched her turn a coffee-thermos upside down to get the last few drops out before delivering it to us. The coffee wasn't even warm, let alone hot."}
{"text":"This place is right across from the Westin in downtown Pittsburgh.  First, Music was too loud, with no one in the restaurant, making it difficult to even talk to the person sitting next to you.  Food was almost inedible (fish tacos) and the staff was less than attentive.  The bar/restaurant decor was cold and minimalist, but not good minimalist....cheap in all respects.  If this place hasn't been around long, my suspicion is they wont be here next time I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"While Tonic has some menu items that are quite good, my lunch today finally pushed me to the edge of not going to Tonic again. The service at lunch time, especially for a downtown restaurant with a large lunch crowd, is absolutely awful. It should not take an hour for a salad with a cold piece of steak to come out of the kitchen, especially when it was also devoid of the items the menu promised. Usually when this happens at a restaurant, the staff is apologetic, and perhaps offers you a discount on your check for the inconvenience.   No servers try to update you on when your food might be coming out, and act like it is asking too much to perhaps have some utensils. I understand that servers cannot control how quickly food comes out of the kitchen, but it took 20 minutes for the server to run our checks alone, and when she did, the change was incorrect. We were nothing but polite, stating that we'd need to go boxes since our lunch hour was almost up and we had just been served. In return, we got attitude. I had one glass of tea over an hour of waiting, with no offers for refills or any questions about how we were doing.  Tonic needs to hire more servers for the lunch service and not rely on one overworked and disgruntled server to give good service to an entire floor of the restaurant.  I only gave it two stars because I've never seen vermin there and it's always been clean."}
{"text":"Great burger, my wife had the salmon and said it was awesome! Had mussels for a 5$ special that was better than the night before down the street for 11$. Good service great food!"}
{"text":"We were pressed to find a reservation for 6 people at 7 pm on a Saturday, but Tonic was able to accommodate us. Our service was very good. However, the food was generic. The decor is seriously outdated. The paint on the walls was chipped. It's a shame that a restaurant at such a prime location with challenging competition puts up such a bad show."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before a show. Great greeting from the hostess, and it was downhill from there. Rude bartender, long wait to make the order, long wait for the drink and rather lack luster drinks once we tasted them. Only redeeming comment was thanks for your patience, when she brought us the check. I'll pass in the future."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend stumbled into this location on pure accident.  It is very cozy and on the corner right across the street from the Westin and just a block down from the convention center.  Service was impeccable(thank you Dustin). Dustin also gave us some locations to visit the following day that were awesome! Food was amazing as well. We shared a chicken salad that was very large and very tasty. Also had a chicken wrap that was very flavorful.  Will definently return to this gem next time i visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"given that i've had to work in pittsburgh mon-thurs for the past 4 months, this has really been my go to place for dinner.  especially because it's right across the street from the westin.  don't really drink so can only speak to the food.  i've had all the salads and sandwiches.  they're really priced well, none of them over $14 and portions are large.  and because of that i haven't even tried any of the large plates yet!  a couple of my favorites are: - rib-eye salad: good beef, but really love the sweet potato fries they add to the salad.  huge portion too. - crab cake sandwich:  big crab cake patty with a really good sauce.  glad this place is here because there really isn't much else downtown..."}
{"text":"I have to stop here every time I'm lucky enough to be in this beautiful city. The staff and atmosphere at Tonic are always friendly and welcoming, they mix up the best drinks in the city, and their maple apple burger is the most amazing burger I've ever tasted. It's not cheap, exactly, but absolutely worth it. Getting here is honestly one of the high points of my annual Pennsylvania trip.  Careful if you decide to be seated upstairs; the stairs are quite the trip back down after a few of Tonic's drinks. They certainly don't make them weak here!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was here for a conference that was meeting across the street and stopped in for lunch. I was pleased to see relatively inexpensive food (compared to the city where I live) that was made with such fresh, quality ingredients and delicious, not to mention beautifully presented. And the guy and gal working there were so friendly and pleasant. I was so pleased with my meal that I told three other people attending the conference about it and they all ended up eating there and were just as happy as I was. I ordered ground beef tacos (2 are served) and a side salad. The tacos had a delicious lime-flavored sauce. The salad was all quality greens -- no romaine or iceberg -- and the blue cheese dressing was very good. The server said all dressings are made in house. All that for under $11 not including tip and I was full, but felt like I'd had a healthy meal. I don't usually bother writing reviews, but I want to give them a boost. If it were near where I lived, I'd be eating there all the time."}
{"text":"We ended up going there the for a party after a rehearsal dinner and they did a great job handling the large group!"}
{"text":"Nice place for the area, which can be sporadic at best. Decent food and a nice staff contribute to the bright environment. Not a very big place, but cozy. There is a second floor for private parties and such. Interesting menu with a wide selection of favorites with a twist of their own."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, really good gourmet burger, sweet potato fries are outta sight.  Food was a little slow coming but worth the wait.  The Tonic Tonic did its namesake proud.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Right across the street from the Westin Hotel and the convention center. Service was wonderful, but there were not many people there at 8 pm on a Friday night. A huge group was convening for a 3 day volleyball tournament. So we were surprised to have such a nice quiet spot to hang out. The Tomato Basil Bisque and cob salad were yummy!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst and most alienating service I've ever received in any city I've ever traveled to. The waitress serving our table did not take our order, we ordered at the bar and told her we did not want to run a tab-she ignored this and then attempted to run clump us in with a group we did not order with. Continued to argue that they could not run our individual tickets due to 'how much time it would take', and once I (unfortunately, I had to be a little more aggressive) asserted that I did not open a tab and wanted my card to be ran, they complied and it took less than a minute. It becomes astoundingly clear that they were attempting to apply a mandatory group gratuity, which I understand as I and everyone concerned work in or have worked in the service industry. We did not order together, as I previously stated we hardly got a drink or service. I have never in my entire life not tipped someone but their manipulation, arrogance and aggression does not warrant my money. They did not apply gratuity to my single ticket, but did to the rest of the individuals that payed after me. Their cocktails are also whatever, and hardly seem to contain anything they claim to contain (considering I watched them make my drink, I also KNOW this is the case). Again, bar none the worst experience I've ever had anywhere and had I not had any sympathy for people in the service industry I would have straight up walked out with the kind of service we received."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and was not disappointed. Our waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. She was attentive and also helped my boyfriend in selecting two of the mixed drinks. We ordered the jalapeno beer cheddar dip with warm pretzels as our appetizer, and it was by far the best pretzels with dip dish I've had! We both got the apple burger: DELICIOUS. We will definitely be visiting Tonic again. Great, trendy joint for a fantastic burger."}
{"text":"Got food delivered via the order up service. Cuban sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was terrific, loaded with meat and cheese and delicious high end pickles, not cheap hamburger slices like some places use. Perfect amount of spicy mustard and perfectly panini'd. The salad was a fresh delicious generous portion with a great homemade remoulade. Highly recommended. Yes, it's a tad pricey but you definitely get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I recently visited Tonic with a large group and we had the first floor to ourselves. There is also outdoor and upstairs seating. The interior of the restaurant was very nice and bright, and the staff were nice and very professional.  We started with the squash flatbread appetizer, which was pretty good. The goat cheese provided a nice salty component to the creamy flatbread, and the vegetables were nicely cooked. The bread itself was soft and warm.  I then had cajun tilapia, served with wild rice, asparagus, and paprika cream. This is where I wasn't as impressed. First, the portion size was on the smaller side, so even after two pieces of flatbread and the entire entree, I wanted to eat more. There were only three or four spears of asparagus. However, everything was cooked deliciously--the asparagus was tender; the fish had a deliciously crispy exterior and moist, flaky interior; and the rice was good. The paprika cream did not agree with me though. I didn't like the strong cream taste. In addition, there was too much on the plate. It covered most of the other components and turned a delicious plate into a not-so-great one. I tried to get as much of it off as I could. If it weren't for that, I'd be very happy with the food here.  Bathrooms are also very clean, but there is just one, not separate stalls.  I would be happy to return to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Super nice and helpful staff.  Bartender was very personable. Food was delicious! Piping hot with all the right spices.   It would have 5 stars but I asked for the chicken quesadilla without the chicken. I was told no because they are pre-prepared. Yuck."}
{"text":"Meh.  Waiter knew nothing about their beer list, \"um, I think that one is pretty popular\", and when it came out, it was dead flat. Food was average.  Menu looks impressive for a bar, but was not executed properly.  I expected better food for the price.   Fine place to grab drinks, but I wouldn't advise eating there unless you got hungry after several cocktails."}
{"text":"Got there for lunch.  Loved the apple burger. Had an IPA beer to go with it. Bla bla bla"}
{"text":"Not only was the food excellent, the service was great. Good environment, good tunes, overall, a perfect pre-show dinner. We had a group of 10, and they accepted our reservation a week in advance, everyone was pleased with their meal. Look forward to coming back next time we are in the 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"I go to Tonic a lot.  Mostly late night for some drinks and sometimes something to eat.    The seared tuna is a favorite and I think the samurai burgher (with seaweed) is the best burgher ever.    I'm usually there a couple times a week and obviously it's one of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"Ate here before the Pirates game Friday night with friends.  Server was very nice.  Something got messed up with our order and it took an hour to get our food.  We were sad to miss an inning of the game, but Tonic stepped up and did everything right in the face of their error.  Ours meals were comped and the manager was involved - all without us asking.  Once the food got there, it was fantastic!  I would go again, but probably not on a day that we have plans to be somewhere after.  It is understandable that sometimes errors happen.  I was happy that Tonic stepped up and did what they needed to do to make it right by us.  Unfortunately the Bucs lost, but they ultimately took the series 2-1 :)"}
{"text":"Tonic is a good spot to meet a downtown coworker for an after-work adult beverage.  The martinis are delicious and the beer selection has a good variety of not-so-run-of-the-mill beers.    This is where I had my first  \"Raging B*tch\" and I can say that I am a fan.  The appetizers are good, though the entrees can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Very friendly and comfortable place to have a casual on the road dinner if you are staying downtown. Food was very good and they have a diverse beer selection."}
{"text":"The apple (+bacon and maple aioli) burger is ahhmazing. Their wraps, also delicious. They serve the best french fries - the ones with the little crunchies on them. We choose here for lunch sometimes during the work day. Reliable seating availability upstairs. Great building and location, especially during furry week. Perfect furry spotting locale. Occasionally the service is a bit too slow. And my friends order no pickles, but they always leave mine off as well. Boo."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last night  and our entire visit was horrible. Upon arriving we stood by the door for a good five minutes waiting to be seated before figuring maybe we were just missing something, and sat down at an empty table. With no wait staff in sight apart from the bartender we waited for about another 10-15 minutes before deciding to try out luck at the bar. Once again another 10 minutes passed by before the bartender asked us if we had been waiting, when if I'm not mistaken she had not only seen us walk in but also witnessed our seat change.  So, we ordered drinks and they were decent nothing special in my opinion. However, my friend did complain that her's was a little too strong but she can be very picky with those sorts of things. In regards to the food, it seemed they were pretty much out of anything anyone would really want. For example, when I tried to order the beer cheese dip the bartender told me they were out and recommended the buffalo chicken dip which I subsequently ordered. It turned out to be extremely spicy which caused me to down my drink about twice as fast. I wasn't too big of a fan. My friend ended up ordering some sort of barbecue burger and was told that they were out of hamburger buns so it would be on wheat bread. She said it was an okay burger but she wished the bread hadn't been so soggy. Overall, this night was a complete waste of money and while I can't speak for the service and quality of food during lunch time, I can certainly say I will not be returning to Tonic Bar & Grill anytime soon and I would advise you to do the same."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Hoped to get same service I got last night. Instead I got a dismissive waitress who was more interested in talking to her incoming regular customers at volume 11 right next to my head.  Guy came and brought me my food: \"here's your turkey burger!\" \"I asked for a veggie\" \"oh yeah, that's what I meant.\"  Went to bar to ask my waitress for silverware. \"Sure!\" Gives it to me. I give her a quizzical look. \"is Everything ok?\" \"Um, I was kinda expecting an apology for the oversight.\"I wasn't being rude, ma'am!\"   So rude wasn't exactly why I was thinking. Poor service is not the same thing as rude.  So, I tuck into my veggie burger. Surprise! It was turkey. A nice man came over and is in process of fixing it.   Service last night was stellar. Hoping they will work on consistently. I Yelp so..work out these kinks, Tonic.   You've got a nice menu, comfortable decor. You'll get another chance but please ensure ALL staff are a little more service oriented and professional.  I will be back!  Note-it's a Tuesday. Less than 10 people here. You can do this."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Their drinks are great, and the food isn't far behind. If you haven't been, go. If you have been, go back. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I started my meal with their fresh squeezed lemonade, probably my favorite non-alcoholic drink in the world.  After which i had to wait a good 25-30 minutes to get my braised short-rib panini with au jus and sweet potato fries.  My annoyance over the wait evaporated when i tried the food...the sweet potato fries are served with an awesome maple aioli.. and bites like Tonic's short rib panini is one reason why i choose to no longer be vegetarian.  Brasied short rib meat, onions and provolone with the au jus that tastes like french onion soup.    I didn't get to try any of the cocktails they're known for but I'm so used to drinking for cheap in Pittsburgh (whether its in oakland, southside or shadyside) it was actually strange to be in a bar with the drink menu that Tonic has.  It's obviously a place for professionals working downtown and is an escape from the working-class/college/sports/dive bars that dominate the burgh.    I got their chicken quesadilla to go which came in an eco-friendly biodegradable to-go container, big plus."}
{"text":"Unmemorable at best. I should have walked the block and a half to my house instead of spending money here."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on writing a review of Tonic. They've switched management, they've switched bar service.  They're over priced -- sure.  The food is subpar but has gotten better within the last year. Their drinks are pretty grand.   I've heard rumors of the managements battle with the bottle, and it's perhaps not hard to imagine it being true. Everything is very disorganized, the service is usually a little snotty, the drinks have been hit or miss lately.   Here's the deal, if you're in a rut, there's worse places to eat than Tonic. There's worse bars to drink at than Tonic. Just make sure you have some extra cash as the prices aren't the most agreeable. The sweet potato fries were good, they were quite soggy the last time i had them. My first trip was the worst trip, my second trip was lovely, my third trip was horrific. If you're a gambling person... give this place a shot. It might prove pretty impressive, or it might not."}
{"text":"I love the place.  i'm a pittsburgh native who lives in VA and was back in town for about 24 hours last weekend.  My wife and I stayed at a nearby hotel, and we ended up at Tonic on a Friday night for some drinks and appetizers.  Food was Ok, drink selection was above average and the service was great.  Environment was pretty chill for a Friday night, especially considering the Pittsburgh Panthers were playing a Big East Tournament game.  The following day, we decided to go back and have lunch.  The 3 people in our party all enjoyed out meals.  I had the ribeye sandwich, which was AWESOME.    All in all, nice casual place with decent food and a good drink list.  I'll probably go back to try a full dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"If i could give this place zero stars I would. I work downtown so about 8 co workers and I went for Happy Hour. Everything started out great, they told us to head upstairs, our server took our orders but then she straight up disappeared. It got busier so we had to go to the bar to order anything from that point on. It was inconvenient but fine. We received our order of pretzels and the cheese was cold. We ate it anyways anticipating our nachos. The nachos came out, ice cold. Not kidding. We sent it back politely. They made us a new order, brought it out. Even colder! We could not believe it. At that point we told them to just take it off our bill and the girl rolled her eyes and said \"sure\" as if it was our fault. The service was appalling, there are so many other happy hour spots downtown, avoid Tonic."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner as part of a group event. Couldn't decide between the blackened salmon and the prime rib, so a friend and I went halfsies on both. The prime rib was excellent, and the salmon was quite good. Came with a fresh-tasting tomato bisque. I appreciated the option of fruit salad for dessert - a good mix of mangoes, berries, and grapes - although I stole a bite of the layered chocolate mousse cake, which made me at least  touch jealous.  Menu options for vegetarians/vegans was limited, but they were willing to accommodate by making a meatless-friendly entree for those members of the group (a pasta dish)."}
{"text":"I've been here once. Unfortunately, once was enough for me.  I visited during happy hour, so I stuck to cocktails and lite bites rather than ordering full plates of food. I certainly thought the drinks and appetizers were ok. I enjoyed my Whiskey sour and berry Cosmo quite a bit. The wings I ordered were ok: not in my top 5 as far as wings go, but tasty nonetheless. I admittedly think it took me less time to devour my wings than it took for the food to get to us, unfortunately. But sometimes things get backed up (especially on Friday); and what we got ranged from decent to good, so hey - all was well.  Then I asked for the check, and was told it couldn't be split up in large groups. ...Why not mention this when you sat us? We were a big party. You knew this when we arrived and asked how many people needed to be seated. Surely this would have been useful info to bring up then? (Simply asking if this was anyone's first time would have indicated we didn't know this policy and needed to know of it before ordering.)  Ultimately the server did end up separating all of our checks out, once we pointed this problem out and said many of us simply had no cash and no way to accommodate the unknown one check rule. But I will never forget the failure to mention this fact in the first place. I'm admittedly not happy that the waitress fussed at the request as well, but if it was restaurant policy, I can understand her balking...to a point. And while I appreciate her eventually splitting our checks, I left feeling all-around frustrated with the service and with no inclination to return. 2.5 stars from this reviewer. Sorry, Tonic. This is one spot I'm just going to have to pass on in the future."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere at Tonic Bar & Grill. Waiter and staff are very friendly and it is a comfortable place to go especially when you are a visitor to the city.  I had one of their burgers while my wife had the roast beef au jus. I would say the food was a bit better than average. It certainly doesn't knock your socks off nut it isn't disappointing either. Just a tad better than average.  While our food wasn't memorable, Tonic Bar & Grill is still a place I would have no problem going back to for some pub style food."}
{"text":"This first thing and last thing I noticed was that it smelt and looked unclean. This was made worse when my first utensils were dirty. Not an issue for most just going for drinks but for lunch I almost left. If not for the suggestion of my hotel I would have left. I gave the food a chance. A turkey sandwich was fine but nothing that would make up for the general dingy feeling."}
{"text":"we went here for after dinner drinks on a thursday night.  it was mostly empty, with only 2 staff members.  unfortunately we had a bad experience.  the atmosphere was very blah.  the music was ok.  David Bowie was playing. the staff were semi attentive...my drinks were fine.  i enjoy a goat cheese stuffed olive in my dirty martini!! however my man ordered a sriracha bloody mary, the bartender re made it twice.  explained she didn't know the recipe.  she was nice and did not charge us for it in the end, but overall we will probably not ever go back."}
{"text":"We love swinging by here to have a cocktail and a snack.  The bartender has always been great and makes anything we ask for, they use a ton of fresh juices and even make their own syrups.  We have been here three times in the last month and it is always the same lady bar tending.  I had the jalapeño beer cheese and pretzels, my husband had the hummus, both were great!  Bartender asked us if we wanted samples when we asked how spicy the dips were.  They even have their own card for people that come here a lot."}
{"text":"Took a quick stop here about a year ago before heading to a pirates game. Friendly and patient service. I had some really good mac n cheese & tater tots, my brother had loaded nachos, and my dad a huge burger! Was very good, wish I could've gone back before it closed :/"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night during Pittsburgh's Light Up Night. First sign something was amiss was when our server, after sitting for a couple minutes already, passed us and said it was going to be several more minutes until he could take care of us. We sat upstairs, in a decently sized room. This server was waiting on the entire floor.  The draft \"cider\" was very light tasting, comparable to watered down apple juice. Ordered hummus as an appetizer, took at least 30 minutes to get it... I wish I had been watching the clock throughout the experience because it took WAYYY TOO LONG to get our food. Everyone else in the dining room was experiencing the same thing, so it wasn't because our waiter forgot about our food.  BBQ pork/ham sandwich with tater tots and the western burger... anything fried was overdone to the point it was too soaked in grease to eat and not feel sick. Onion rings on the sandwiches, tater tots. Those things aside, the sandwiches were just okay... we were super hungry by the time the food came, at least an hour after ordering, so anything would've tasted fine!  Where is management?  Never once noticed a manager.  No one came to our table or anyone else's for that matter.  Don't give one server an entire floor he can barely keep up with. Clearly there were problems in the kitchen... even more disappointing to have to sit and wait on food and miss out on the festivities happening that night.  I could've understood if there were some good explanation and there was an attempt made to rectify the situation.  I'm not looking for handouts, but geez at least take the appetizer off? Buy your guests a drink? Nothing was taken off the bill.   Hopefully the manager was helping out in an unexpectedly understaffed kitchen. Yeah we'll go with that.  Pass."}
{"text":"Tonic is solid, with good food and well mixed drinks. It can be a little pricy at times, especially for their tdrinks, but it's good stop. Keep in mind the place can get busy, so try not to judge the service when it's crowded.  If you're looking for amazing barfood you CAN NOT go wrong with the poutine. Seriously. It's one of the most addictive foodstuffs known to man, and Tonic does it with roasted rib meat. I'm getting all teary eyed just thinking about it.  Only downside is Tonic is split into two distinct bars - an upstaris and downstairs. Upstairs, the noise echos and can get REALLY loud, especially when there's a rowdy group. Also, the black paint used on the tables has an odd stickiness to it. It's weird, and a little unsettling.   Stay downstairs if you can."}
{"text":"I used to go here every once and a while for lunch.  The first time I went I really wasn't a fan.  I got the fish taco's which is something I normally love, but these were very fishy tasting tacos, plus they were more on the cold side, not to mention they were $14.00!  SO i didn't think I would go back, but I am glad I did give them another chance because their burgers are very good.  Yes they are a bit expensive but I have come to realize almost everywhere that sells a more gourmet burger you are going to spend 10+ on it and, it certainly was a much better option/value than the two stinky tacos I got the first time.  I am not a fan of their dressing for their side salads.  Just missing the target on flavor with them, but the burgers are good, and I would say try it for that if nothing else.   Also don't be in a hurry.  Lunch from sit down to leaving approximately 50 minutes."}
{"text":"One thing I don't care for is being greeted slowly at an empty bar.  I stopped in a 3:30pm there was only one other patron seated at the bar...but for some unknown reason I had to wait to get my drink order.  Now bare in mind I don't have a lot of time on the clock. So this unnecessary slow start affected me more negatively then it usually would.  So finally the bar maid saunters over.  Her attitude was cheerful and that half made up for the wait.  I ordered a Lancaster Strawberry Wheat beer and pork belly starter.  For the $7.00 dollar price tag I was expecting a nice size portion and that's not what I got. My jaw nearly dropped when I saw the portion that was served to me. \"Where's the rest of my food?!?\"  The pork belly was served with savory corn muffin that had bacon baked into it. It all tasted very good, but man I was still hungry.   The Lancaster Strawberry Wheat beer was very tasty, I selected if from the beer made in Pennsylvanian section. Tonic Bar & Grill helped me to support our local businesses.   Bonus Blue Moons I saw are actually .75 cent less expensive then other bars on the same street."}
{"text":"Yummy drinks (and a good deal for the size), average food, and decent service.  The restaurant has outdoor seating and right across from the Westin so it's a nice place to hang out if you're staying nearby.  Food is served until midnight.  Try the sweet potato fries, they're delicious and way better than the normal french fries."}
{"text":"If I were to come here again it would be for the drinks, which I unfortunately did not get to sample - aside from the La Prima coffee. Tonic, for its namesake, has a very interesting cocktail menu which you can find on their website. They also have Guinness, Hop Devil, and Penn Pilsner on tap. I had their cod sandwich, which was good overall - the tarter sauce was creative. but not good enough. This is absolutely a cocktail and appetizer restaurant. The desserts should not be missed either, they have delicious cheesecake.  Tonic is just beautiful (except for all the noise), the private dining room upstairs combines warm tones with dim lighting, exposed brick and huge windows. If I had to pick a place for an upcoming bridal shower, this would be it."}
{"text":"This bar has a very modern and nice interior. While here, we had a Citrus Mojito. The drink was large, fresh and tasty.  They have a limited draft selection for beers, but have a large bottle selection for the beer drinker."}
{"text":"Was here again about a month ago. As mentioned in my first review, I was super intrigued by the \"kitchen sink\" burger, so I got it to-go one night. I got it with sweet potato fries. It was delish. So good.  Came back another night with a friend and got the chicken caesar salad ($15). Huge and SO good! But - dessert was the true winner of the night. Our waitress (Amanda according to my receipt) was super nice and recommended what I think was a special. It was a s'mores parfait (see picture!) Layers of deliciousness (marshmallow, chocolate mousse, graham cracker crumbs & more!) that I never wanted to end. And at $5, it was a bargain. Will return solely for the dessert!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious handcrafted cocktails and braised short ribs.  On an Amtrak layover in Pittsburgh?  Definitely stop here!    The food here was high quality and tasted delicious and way better than we could have had on the trains.  Braised short ribs seem to be on so many menu items.    The service was really friendly and prompt.  They were cool that we'd be there for a few hours and even gave us a place to park our luggage.    I don't live in Pittsburgh but if I ever return this place would definitely be where I would visit."}
{"text":"Dined here last night and sat at the bar. Had their happy hour appetizers and special main coarse. There mussels appetizer was amazing. Some of the best mussels I have eaten in a very long time. There beer cheese appetizer was just ok. The beer cheese is served cold. It was good, but I didn't expect it to be cold. The French onion soup and my entree was spot on.  The casual dinning area is really nice for a bar type area. Very clean and modern style that I love. The bartender was friendly and could hold a conversation without being intrusive to the party I was with."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and loved it. Nice atmosphere and great service. I loved the decor and will certainly go back. I had the nachos with chicken and they were very good. The guacamole was good you can tell it was fresh."}
{"text":"I dig this place. Quiet lunch spot to grab a quick bite to eat and a solid cocktail.  House-made tonic is quite good.  I wish they would bring back the pork belly tacos. They were generously sized for the price."}
{"text":"Cassie and Aubrey behind the bar were friendly, attentive, and happy to provide some info on the city. The pork belly tacos with tots were outrageous, and beautifully presented. Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped at Tonic after having cocktails at Ten Penny. I've always wanted to try it, but someone timing was always off, but not this particular evening. The atmosphere was pretty casual. There were a few patrons - not many - no the noise level was fine. Our server was pretty attentive; gave us our menus right away and made helpful suggestions. I don't typically go for a burger, but that night I was in the mood. I settled on the kitchen sink turkey burger and if my memory serves me correctly, it was constructed with avocados, a black bean and corn salsa, fried onion rings, and other goodies that I can't remember now. I remember when it came out, the burger stood up stately with a steak knife right through it. For my side I opted for a salad and asked for a light dressing which was a lemon based vinaigrette. I liked that they didn't skimp on the portions. They were ample and left me feeling quite satisfied. Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Tonic makes arguably the best mixed drinks in Pittsburgh that I've had to date. They make the best vodka tonic I've had in town, and the most respectable mojito I've had yet in Pittsburgh.  My wife loves the martini menu, especially the lemon drops. There's also a drink called the \"Buzz Lightyear\":  buzz lightyear  stoli strawberry, triple sec & tang  Gotta respect any bar that uses tang. Check out this drink menu:  http://www.tonicpittsburgh.com/drinks.html   The service is OK depending on how busy it is, but service at the bar is typically very good. The food isn't bad, just not the primary reason why I go there.  They have most of the standard fare - wraps and sandwiches.   This is a great happy hour place."}
{"text":"ASK if they can do separate checks BEFORE you order!!!  Perfect location across from convention hotel, great service even though they were short-staffed (only two servers on a busy shift) that night. Drinks were delicious and we sat outside on a night with perfect weather. Unfortunately after the first drink a construction team came with extremely loud equipment to tear up a portion of the street. When we requested to tab out expecting separate checks, they explained that the owner had a policy to NOT separate checks. After much conversation from various members of our party, they eventually agreed to it.    Get clarification first on their check policy."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on the Friday of Antrocon (aka Furries) taking over downtown Pittsburgh. They have a great location for Furry-watching, whether outside, inside or upstairs. Unfortunately, that was probably the best part of the experience and Tonic didn't really have anything to do with that.  Our server, Justin, was very nice. He was attentive to our needs and very friendly. But the meal was slooooooooooooooow. There were maybe 4-5 other occupied tables and it took FOREVER for our food to come out. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't have an hour and a half lunch break. Especcially for a burger!!!  Their menu was intriguing, but I was not impressed with my burger. I liked the idea of it...guacamole & corn salsa...but the roll seemed stale and the meat was nothing special. For a $20 lunch, I expected a little more."}
{"text":"In short... the drinks are amazing, the food was ok, service pretty good.    The long story is that I very much enjoyed the Mojito (made with Vodka) my dining partner had a great Brazilian Getaway - (Mango Vodka, Lime, Cranberry, and OJ) I wanted to try pretty much everything, because everyone in the place had a different but tasty looking beverage.   The food.. kinda ok. we started with the Tempura Chicken (Skip it. not great) then I had Caesar Salad (ok, little peppery) and friend had the Crab Cakes ( Loved them)    Service was pretty good.. once you got past the host.  He wasn't the most personable, however the waitress and bar staff made up for it.. as did he when we went to leave (much nicer and talked with us on way out)    All in all I'd say go!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner at Emporio last night.  I love joints like this.  Their happy hour and late night specials are maybe the best I've seen in Pittsburgh.  The $5 tonic tonic was delicious and tasted like it should cost $12.  Cool atmosphere that reminded me of a lot of bars in Seattle.  Didn't get anything to eat, but definitely will the next time we come."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here before the winter beerfest due to its proximity to the convention center. We've drank here multiple times but never thought to try their food. We arrived before the rest of our party so we had a drink at the bar. The initial person who asked what we wanted wasn't that friendly and didn't offer us a drink menu. After getting up and trying to figure out what beers were in the coolers, another bartender offered us menus. We were also served popcorn with a ranch seasoning while we waited at the bar. It was really good. Not greasy with a nice flavor.   Once the rest of our group arrived, we moved to a table in the bar area (the upstairs was booked). The menu isn't extensive but everything we had was delicious. The consensus was that the buns for the sandwiches had to have been made at a local bakery- they were very fresh. Two people in our party had turkey burgers and they loved them. The side of the day was broccoli with a sweet chili sauce, which was a nice way to spice up broccoli. One couple shared fish tacos and raved about the seasoning on the fish.   All in all, I won't rule tonic out in the future when looking for a place to eat. The service isn't five stars but not so bad I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Go here for the drinks, not for the food.  The martini is 9 ounces and they have a great selection of booze.  I was so impressed with the drinks, that I'm going to pretend that we never ate there as otherwise this would get dragged down to 3 stars.  The food isn't bad, it's just a little overpriced.  The drinks, though, now that is a different story.  I could spend a whole afternoon going through their concoctions.  4 star bar, 3 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited to taste the legendary sweet potato fries, but was disappointed. They were good and the maple dipping sauce was savory, but I wouldn't go out of my way for them. Also had tacos with chicken (they were out of carnitas) which were fine. Again, nothing to write home about.   Decor was also very mediocre. Had potential but we felt like it looked cheap downstairs. The price boards behind the bar were those black panels with snap on white letters like you see at snack bars. Upstairs looked nice when we popped in with its exposed brick walls and wood.   There are certainly nicer places to go downtown. Sorry, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Their specialty drinks were great, even though a bit pricey for Pittsburgh. Service was not so great. We had a large group, and I understand that is hard for a single waitress to handle. However I made reservations weeks in advance, so I would expect they would not have the poor girl handling all tables on the bottom floor plus our 20+ group. You're a bar in downtown Pittsburgh, and my group easily spent $1,500+... I would expect to be taken care of a little better. And the attitude from the hostess wasn't appreciated either. I don't think any of my 20+ group will be back, too many new, great places downtown to return to Tonic."}
{"text":"Still catching up...  We came here before seeing Coheed and Cambria last month, and I had THE best fish n chips ever! The cole slaw that came with it were good as well. The nachos were also very good except for the guac which wasn't flavorful enough. We didn't have time for dessert. Our server was great and understood that we were in a hurry. This is a nice, intimate place to be found Downtown."}
{"text":"Turkey panini and sweet  potato fries were excellent. Music was a little loud but we were there after 8pm. It was Friday night and it wasn't that busy with no wait and we had 7 people. Good selection of drinks and house made liqueurs but at 9.50 a drink it was too much for me."}
{"text":"Review is based on multiple visits over a weekend stay in the city. 3 1/2 stars if I could. Overall, pretty impressed. Both the regular menu as well as the late-night bar snack offerings are worth the stop. Ended up here originally because all the other places on the block didn't have late-night dining (but I didn't know that late night was 10PM on a Friday..oh well).  Wine list is ok, and the server even went out of her way to suggest a new wine that wasn't yet on the menu based on my choice the night before. Bonus points for good memory!!  The black bean guac dip was great, a true winner, above and beyond most \"bar food\" deep-fried choices. Just enough spice to be tasty but not too hot. Also the vegetable flatbread was amazing- tasted so fresh and crispy well-done just as ordered. It was nice to have friendly, attentive service, and the location is perfect for those staying at the Westin across the street (so much better than their restaurant). Jalapeno mussels were passable. Nice atmosphere. TV's to watch over the bar. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place, particularly for lunch.  I feel as if it's underrated and doesn't get the attention and patronage it deserves.  While I'll admit I don't go there often for happy hour I'll focus my review on the food I've had with a shout out to their martinis.    The sweet potato fries are fantastic - best I've had in the Burgh and their maple aoli for dippin - yum!  I usually get the chicken wrap (grilled) with a side of the sweet potato fries, I haven't been disappointed every time I order this.    The martinis I've had here are delish and can rival the ones at Olive or Twist.  I think I've heard people complaining about the costs of the drinks...ummm martinis are usually pricier and you don't need 5 to make an impact, unless of course you are looking to wake up in an unfamiliar place or facedown on the street.    Go on give it a try!"}
{"text":"We had a party for 50 people in the upstairs room.  The staff was GREAT! Friendly, helpful..did everything I asked with a big smile.  They went out of their way to set the room up, get music and talk to all the guests.  The food was excellent, and they let me bring in whatever I needed to make the party perfect.  This is definitely the place to go downtown if you have a bigger sized party!"}
{"text":"My friend from Ohio invited me to Tonic for a quick dinner after a super stressful day. We were exhilarated by the day's success and eager to slow things down for a laid back dinner. This restaurant was vertically shaped with dimmed lighting; and the cozy slick décor was accentuated by the close table arrangements in proximity to the bar, charming red brick interior and large windows. The place was filled with a young professional crowd packing the bar area, and my friend decided to have a chicken pita ($10) while I ordered their pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce, cheddar, and a side of sweet potato fries ($9.50).  It was pretty cold with a light rain that drizzled half way into the dinner. My food got cold pretty quickly but it was still decent. The juicy pulled pork was tasty in between the soft buns, but the barbecue sauce was timid while the piece of half-melted cheddar was uninspiring. Although the sweet potato fries were nicely cut into thick pieces, I was mostly pleased with its texture but the use of ketchup for dipping was unimaginative. I ended having to ask for hot sauce to spice up my meal, but otherwise the experience was unspectacularly okay.   Service was attentive and friendly. This is definitely more of a bar than restaurant as we were asked several times if we wanted to order drinks. Later I decided to have coffee for dessert but had to take it black since they didn't have soy. Overall, I believe this place might be the most effective as a lunch spot by day and a trendy bar by night. This said, we still enjoyed the nice ambiance as it gave us the opportunity to catch up on life and work. With mixed results, 3 stars for the dining experience."}
{"text":"Had their lunch special sandwich, which was the farmhouse burger. (ingredients were angus burger, sauteed spinach, grilled portobello mushrooms, goat cheese)  The only things that had flavor were the mushrooms and goat cheese.  The burger was mediocre at best.  The service was OK, but slow.  Although I won't be returning back here for food anytime soon, it looks like a great place for some drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Host was rude and snarky. Waitress and staff were pleasant.  Food was flavorful, semiunique and with a great price.     Would recommend tonic.   Please fire your host.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Well......haven't visited in several months- Service was horrible, but what I am most saddened by is their TURKEY BURGER- They used to have the best one EVER and today, it was terrible---sooooo disappointing!"}
{"text":"CAN YOU HEAR ME?!!!!  Yes, that's what you'll be saying if you eat in the bar area - alot. I found it hard to hear from the well dressed locals at the bar knocking back drinks after work. But, I can see why they come here too. (The wait staff are actually pretty cute, as are the women at the bar!)  Personally, I suggest eating outside or in the upstairs dining area. The food portion size is acceptable, and the drink selection from their full service bar was very good. The specials of the day tend to be tried winners rather than hit or miss, but there are plenty of good favorites there that will make almost anyone happy.  Yeah, they get a little fru-fru on some of their meals, but for the most part - it's good food and well served.  Right across from the Convention Center, this is a place to keep in mind - that is if you don't mind paying a little more for convience and your drinks."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great drinks, amazing food with plenty on the menu I wouldn't usually cook at home (a way I prefer to order), and great staff from the servers to the owner. When I lived in the burgh I used to frequent here, and going back again today reminds me why.  Not to mention you almost always find the visiting baseball teams hanging here.  UPDATE: Two days later I had a gathering of 33 people to Tonic, all of whom were from out of town and most of us had never met (osteopathic pediatricians conference). Tonic was a huge hit... With options for all and terrific service. Josh was my server for lunch the other day, and while he had other tables tonight he was quite friendly and welcoming (and more importantly: happy). One of the managers (Mark?) was my tables rver and one of e bar tenders for e large party... And again.... SO helpful.  As for the gastronomic choices... The short braised rib panini with au juis sauce was absolutely light yet filling.. And again, delicious. Not to mention good sweet potato Fries. I only had beer these two visits, but I remember terrific mixed drinks.   Thank you, again, Denise!"}
{"text":"I came in town and needed a quick bite before my conference festivities began. This place was right across the street from my hotel so I skipped on over. The small restaurant with large bar seemed more like a late night hang out than a place known for their good. Either way I was hungry so I wen't ahead and ordered.   I quickly noticed the fish and chips and my mouth began to water. I'm a descendant of the British Commonwealth so I love my fish and chips. I seriously use it as a barometer of deliciousness for new restaurants. Over-all meh.   The fish was over-fried so it was a bit dry on the ends. I want moist, flaky goodness with a light, crispy batter. Not so here. The only saving grace was their homemade tartar sauce. The whole eating experience was a bland yawn. The coleslaw boring and fish had no taste without tarter. The best part of the meal were the fries. I do not like french fires at all so I guess that's a compliment. This place is a necessary evil for conference travelers that need to eat. I can say that the portion size was good for the price."}
{"text":"I have been to Tonic three times. Twice for just drinks, and today for lunch.   The first time for a beer to celebrate my new job downtown, which is located nearby on Smithfield Street. The second time with a coworker to rant and rave about work over a couple vodka sodas and sit outside on a summer day. Our male waiter was pleasant and attentive that day, and it was nice sitting outside downtown. We didn't need much from him, but I will say, we each ordered two drinks and it felt like we were just drinking water.  Now, today for lunch... I have gone here with coworkers before, hoping to get lunch, but it was so crowded we got turned away and/or turned off. I came in to work this morning and some girls said they wanted to go to Tonic for lunch and asked if I was interested in going. So for the sake of finally trying the food, and not wanting to turn down a fun lunch, I said \"Count me in!\"  We walked in and were suddenly shooed with a \"Upstairs, upstairs!\" by a women. We looked at the room downstairs and the floor was torn up/being fixed/chairs were everywhere/something was going on. No explanation, just a rude \"Go upstairs.\" We went up and there is a large table with an older crowd, tables with four tops and other business people...a typical lunch crowd. The place was filled, but it didn't seem 'busy.' Voices echoed, and we couldn't hear each other at times...  But as I looked around, I noticed no one had any food on their table. And they looked impatient. This was not a good sign. We got our teas and waters, and it seemed our waitress was overwhelmed.   Everyone at the table but me ordered a salad. I ordered the squash flatbread (in part because reading other reviews, people said the appetizers were better than other things on the menu). Now, how long should a couple salads and a flatbread take to assemble? Over 40 minutes? Because that is how long it took.   Never once did our waitress come over to let us know our food was coming, or that they were struggling today due to the work being done downstairs, or even apologize for the wait. Luckily, we had plenty to talk about and enjoy each other's company, but we only had an hour for lunch. We had to call our office and let them know what was going on, that we would instead be out for an hour and a half lunch.  Never saw a manager or person in charge \"touch tables.\" I would think this is the type of crowd you'd want to keep coming back for lunch. Once the large table got their food, and the ladies next to us got theirs, we thought surely ours would be arriving shortly. Again, we just ordered salads and a flatbread... Still took about 15 minutes or more from that moment.  Then, finally, it was plopped down in front of us by a different waiter. My friend got the steak salad that also came with fries on top. Her steak and fries were cold. To the touch, my flatbread was slightly warm, but the ratio of squash to cheese was ridiculous - so much goat cheese, it was the only thing you could taste. Another friend got the buffalo chicken salad, she didn't complain, I think due to the fact we were all so hungry, but it was nothing to rave about. A friend also got the French onion soup and a side salad, but said the soup was very bland.  The food was not worth the wait. We never got an apology, an explanation, or offered a discount for our obscene wait for our food during lunch hour (12-1pm). This is a downtown location, who obviously has a constant business lunch demand, but they don't do a good job with that crowd. The waitresses would disappear from the room entirely, and it was cold because they left the door downstairs open and it was coming up the stairs. And once it was time to pay, it was sort of chaos because of course, everyone is paying separate checks and they were just throwing out receipts - and then we all had sticker shock at how expensive it was.   I don't mean to complain so much, but we didn't see a manager to speak with, nor were we ever given the opportunity to voice our concerns or felt like our business mattered. My only hope is that they step up their kitchen/wait staff during lunch because this location is not to be taken advantage of. Maybe if we ordered booze we would've been treated differently..."}
{"text":"My group had one appetizer that was pretty good, but everything else was average at best.  None of the sandwiches surpassed \"OK,\" and overall the place just failed to wow on every front.  Nothing was explicitly bad, but there are better options for lunch or dinner.  (Note: I went for dinner; going for drinks or an event might be a different story.)"}
{"text":"Went here while waiting for my Greyhound (don't even get me started on how much I hate their system)  The strategic placement of this restaurant definitely adds to the allure. I went during happy hour and got their mussels and sweet potato fries as recommended by my waitress.  Mussels - delicious, buttery goodness Sweet Potato Fries - Good fries, weird sauce. The selling point was their homemade special sauce for the sweet potato fries which didn't really impress me at all. Too sweet and had little to no taste of anything else.   Would I go here again? Only when waiting for Greyhound."}
{"text":"The Good:  The bartender from Forest Hills. Dale's Pale Ale 2 Bucks off Drinks during happy hour.  The Bad:  Honey Whiskey with Mango Ice Tea Music. There is such a thing as too much Primus. Happy Hour or Late Night - the place is empty."}
{"text":"I can't understand why people in Pittsburgh (who I work with) like this place.  I went there several times last year for lunch and again this week with a group.    The food is mediocre and overpriced.  The french fries are horrible.  The burgers for $11.50+ are small and nothing special. Someone in my group got a turkey burger. It wasn't any better. Salads aren't exciting.  The service is horrible.  30 minutes to get your lunch-time meal is unacceptable.  Each time I have gone there it has taken a long time.    Gets most of it's business from being close to the Convention Center and Westin hotel.    I'm giving it 2 starts because I have been told it is a fun place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"I had lunch several times and food is subpar. Nothing really special about the food. But great place to come after work for a beer or cocktail. Try the TonicTonic if you are a gin lover it is one of their signature drinks."}
{"text":"I went to this place before a concert.  They had a text deal where you got your second drink free  if you texted them.  This is especially excellent since their drinks are so good.  I got the key lime martini and my boyfriend got the sunburn.  Both were tasty.  The food was pretty good.  My boyfriend enjoyed the mac and cheese and I had the crab cake sandwich.  It was pretty empty for happy hour so the vibe was low key.  I'm not sure how crowded the second floor was.  if I  lived in Pittsburgh I'd go again, mostly for the drinks."}
{"text":"Food was very bland tasting, virtually everything seemed to come from SYSCO or the likes. Thought the Buffalo chicken dip looked disgusting. The presentation on everything else (Pork Sandwich & Main Magi tacos) was fine. Sweet potato fries were OK but still tasted like they came from the freezer.  Freshly prepared drinks were right on point, would recommend any of the fresh juice drinks or fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"Tonic tries too hard.  I have never been impressed with any meal that I've eaten there and it always leaves me wanting more.  Unfortunately it's right next to my office so it often gets picked as the lunch spot.    I've gotten the burger a couple times.  It comes on foccachia bread with \"fancy\" greens and never with ketschup or mustard.  I always have to ask for it and by the time it comes from the kitchen, the burger is cold.  The salads never have enough dressing either.    I dont consider myself a picky person when it comes to dining, but I do have a tolerance and a threshold concerning the quality of food and service.  Tonic has crossed that threshold too many times.    I have friends who love the place, but I'll go out of my way to avoid it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is okay...bright, big windows and lots of noise upstairs...but did they run out of decorating money up there?! Your walls are empty! Hmmmm, that could be why there's so much noise!  Nothing to absorb the sound so it just echoes around the room.    Notice I started my review talking about atmosphere and decorating?  That's because there was absolutely nothing special about the food...it was okay...and  it was overpriced for food that was just okay.   One evening I'll try it again for just the drinks...but I'd stay downstairs for better surroundings.  This could be so good with some attention to details."}
{"text":"Love this place. The happy hour specials are awesome and the goat cheese croquettes are out of the world. Good music and atmosphere and the food is prompt."}
{"text":"Located across from the hotel that I was staying at, this was a convenient spot for a quick lunch.  Seating is available outside, downstairs, and upstairs.  I ordered a soup and salad.  Soup was a spicy black bean soup which was more salty, interfering with the flavor.  Needless to say, I could not finish it.  The salad on the other hand had an interesting mixture of fresh greens, red and green bell peppers, and honey dew melons with a light vinaigrette dressing.  The sweet potato fries were Tonic's saving grace - lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.    On a side note, I thought it was very creative and cute to see the bathrooms differentiated for men and women by drawings of fruit."}
{"text":"Nice location, clean, friendly service, seasonal outdoor seating but, a bit sub par.  I did enjoy a Basil-Lemon Gin-tini $9.00 and ordered a hummus platter.  It came with warm pita and vegetables.  The hummus was actually pretty good; it had a unique herb flavor, the pita's well they were just warm pita's and the assorted vegetables were no so fresh.  I did happen to glance over at my table neighbors who had sweet potato fries and hot wings, which looked and smelled yummy.   All in all, the Gin-tini was yummy."}
{"text":"This bar and grill needs separate reviews for the bar and grill aspects. The ambiance is very nonchalant. Reggae is the music of choice. The bar has a couple craft options. There is an event room upstairs. In sum, it's a cool bar.  The food is underwhelming. The menu is large and all over the place. I asked the waitress what the restaurant specializes in, and she didn't have a direct answer. Under the influence of the reggae music, I opted for the jerk chicken sandwich. The chicken was dry, and the sandwich was too sweet without a spicy complement. I'm certainly no restaurant expert; however, I think Tonic would benefit from consolidating their menu and focusing on a particular cuisine."}
{"text":"So there I was, noon on a Tuesday waiting to meet a friend for lunch at a table at Tonic when I got a last minute message that an emergency came up and had to cancel. Felt bad about the emergency but hey, I'm at Tonic now, a restaurant I've had my eye on for some time so I may as well order some lunch.   I made my way to the bar and got a mango iced tea.  A few things worth noting about the bar: its very clean, the bartender was cheerful, they have a variety of craft beers, but the one thing that really stood out, at least for me,  was the bar stools. The wooden square seats on the bar stools struck me as unusually big.   The menu here at Tonic is rather limited but everything looked good.  I decided to go for the French dip and opted for the veggie of the day, grilled asparagus, over fries or salad.   It took a little long for my sandwich to be served, about 25 minutes, but it was worth the wait. It sported a generous portion of roast beef on a fresh roll; not at all fatty and covered in melted Swiss cheeze. The dip tasted as you would expect and contained lots of onions. The grilled asparagus complimented the sandwich nicely.    The bill came to around $15.00 us tip, a bit steep for lunch here everyday but as a once in a while treat I'd come back again."}
{"text":"mehhh.   I haven't had the food so this is a review for only drinking. I can't imagine I'd ever venture out saying, \"Man I really want to go to Tonic tonight\" We came in for a few drinks before a show on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy most tables full eating. We were able to find 2 seats at the bar no problem though.  The bartender looked super overwhelmed from the beginning, asking us right away if we were planning on eating then seeming relieved when we answered no. The boyfriend ordered a Dogfish on tap. I ordered a girly martini that is obviously overpriced at almost $10. I'm still in the college kid mentality of cheap drinks but I guess this is expected in something that attempts to be a hip swanky downtown cocktail destination.   I had my one drink the boyfriend had 2 beers and the check was just laid in front of us. It was about 7:10 pm. I was never asked if I wanted another drink or if we were finished. It just seemed odd to me. But, when I put my card out it took about 10 minutes for him to collect it.  For someone who seemed to want us out of there so fast, it took a while for him to actually allow us to leave.   I'd come back, the food looked decent, maybe it was just an off night. But I really don't think I'd make Tonic a destination I went out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Went in for some drinks and also ordered the hummus plate (recommended). They gave out popcorn. Friendly service from all team members working there - mystery bottled beer everyday. Bar tenders were cool. Hit this place up."}
{"text":"Just passing through Pittsburgh and needed a place to get a bite, as we were staying at the Courtyard right around the corner.  Nicely surprised by the beer selection and the mixed drinks were poured correctly.  The bowl of fries were awesome...perfectly cooked.  Crunchy outside and perfect inside. Calamari was also really good.   Next time we're in Pittsburgh we're stoping here!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Drinks are good. They no longer make the drink I loved. The service on busy weeks is not good (i.e furry convention), but not a bad resturant"}
{"text":"I have been on a happy hour kick for a few months now. Not that I always go but I am always looking for a new place to go. My good friend Hilary and I decided to meet up downtown for a little happy hour. She works down there and the bus to Oakland is usual quick so it is an easy spot for us to meet. I was surprised that it was not very packed considering it was Fat Tuesday. People were sitting at the bar and scattered about on tables it was nice to have a little breathing room while enjoying a night out. Also after happy hour people left in a hurry! We ended up being one of three tables once happy hour was over.   I ordered food off the Happy Hour Menu. I probably could have just gotten a sandwich like I wanted but the $5 food appealed to me.   Fried Brussels: Seasoned with spice rub. These were good. Like I wish the plate had more of them so I could eat them like popcorn the entire night. The sprouts were cut in half and seasoned really well. Not salty at all. The only slight issue is that after a few of them I started to taste the oil they were fried in more and more. It was not a bad taste, but not something that I wished I honed in on.   Wings: Order of 6 with the honey mustard sauce.  These wings were good too. I think that they were just large enough that they didn't make me sad and wish that I ordered 12 (you know those dinky wings I am talking about). The sauce was less than desirable though. I just could not get into it. It had neither a strong taste of honey or mustard. The sauce, in my opinion was super bland. The wings were fried really well but the sauce.. eh..  Hilary got the Fried Shrimp: tossed in spicy remoulade.  This looked really good on the menu. Who doesn't like fried shrimp in a spicy sauce? But when they came out the shrimps were wimpy. The shrimp also shrunk within the breading. It was like you bit into one and the shrimp were inside a little breading cocoon.  Not impressed at all. But she seemed to like them and not complain. The one that I had was not impressive sooo...   THE BOOZE: Ok now to the good part all the boozey drinks I had last night.   $5 special Tonic:  Vodka, fresh squeezed lime, tonic.  Umm... why is it that I have never had a tonic taste this good before. I mean .. seriously? Where have I been hanging out? A barn? This drink was smooth. And for $5 I should have been ordering those all night long. It was great. Hilary and I both agreed that it was a star. Star of the show for sure. Yum... mouth watering thinking about it right now....  Basil Gin-tini: Fresh muddled basil, fresh squeezed lemon, gin, st. germaine.  Not as good as the special tonic. It also did not have a very strong tang of the basil. Usually when you put basil in any drink it makes an impact, this one, not so much. I would say skip it and go for the tonic!  Polemo: Resposado tequila, elderflower, fresh squeezed grape fruit.  Yum. Hilary had this one so I only got a taste. Not bad at all. I really enjoyed my taste, which is saying something since i hate tequila. I would not order one for myself but the taste was good enough to tell others to try it out!  Some type of cocktail with whiskey: I can't find it on the menu! It came in a beer glass. It was awesome. I would pick this and the tonic every day of the week if I had too!  Tonic is A++++ in my book.  It was a fun time!! I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dateline: 2/7/2013. 'Twas the day after my birthday. Observances, as usual, were postponed to the weekend, but more importantly, I had scored free tickets to see Coheed & Cambria with Between The Buried and Me at Stage AE, and we were hastily en route to said concert.   Kay insisted on eating Downtown prior to the show and wouldn't settle for somewhere near the North Shore venue.   I had recalled that a gyro shop was near the Wood Street trolley station, but as The Cosmic Trickster would have it, it was closed for good (an Indian eatery is moving in).   I'd spotted Tonic before and thought that it might be too swanky for us, but I needed to take a chance, quickly for we were running late!   Immediately we were seated and served by a genial young gent who understood our dire situation.  \"Dude? Coheed & Cambria? Are you kidding? We'll get you guys in and out! What do you want, man? Lay it on me.\"  Scanning the menu like an android with laser eyes reading bar codes, we were instantly arrested by the proposition of Tonic's Nachos, Apple Burger, and Fish & Chips (Kay can't pass those up, ever).   The Nachos were almost Supreme, but failed to reach the peak of the mountain due to the bland, baby food that was the guacamole. However, corn salsa, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, and those exactingly fried tortilla chips all had something to say about quality and nearly drowned out the lackluster green paste. This hunger-inducing scene from a Quentin Tarantino-helmed feature was brought to mind...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bN2-6rkeEA  The Apple Burger was focalized on a potent patty that tasted somewhat of smoked pork. My imagination perhaps? Of course, the inclusion of apples, roasted no less, and Applewood smoked bacon only furthered this possible Christmas dinner delusion. The Dutch export known as Gouda cheese, which I suspect wasn't aged long due to its mild flavor, added smooth, creamy texture to this odd burger. Making the mouthfeel all the more engrossing was the crisp bacon and the buttered, internally squishy, externally flaky bun. A lightly sugary maple aioli had me thinking I was eating a delightful and hearty chuck wagon breakfast sandwich (I would have added a fried egg if possible). Yet those apples confused me still...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLuUGDVfheI  I've never had a burger like it before and may never have one like it ever again. Kudos to Tonic for something so risky and unique.   Also above average were the twice-plunged french fries (excellent crisp on these), the chilly dill pickle shaft, and Kay's flavorful and moist battered whitefish which I sampled a few morsels of.   We paid our bill, bid our waiter farewell, and headed back onto the trolley, just in time for Stage AE's lights to be snuffed out and for these mindboggling opening chords to begin quaking the arena...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRbnY8EK4Ew  And later...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aHJEXeSZ4Q  P.S. While Tonic's prices didn't completely agree with my wallet, I enjoyed the comfortably casual, dimly-lit, classy ambience enough to mind little. Not being a drinker, I cannot comment on their libations, but the service was up to par and again, considerate of our harried circumstances."}
{"text":"My BFF swears by the Lemon Drop Martini at Tonic. He made it a point to take me here on my last visit to Pittsburgh. I did have a taste of his Lemon Drop martini and it was phenomenal! They make the lemon juice fresh for each martini. It's the Goldie Locks of sweet and sour.   The staff was super nice and friendly. They even made fun of me for ordering a Twisted Tea (it was for nostalgia can't get it in Texas) because the bartender told me they only stock it for the kitchen staff.   The food looked and smelled awesome, if I hadn't already eaten I would have tried it."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Their lunch specials were great; I had mussels and steak salad, and it was fantastic. It looks divey, but looks are deceiving. Sidewalk seating was a bit limited."}
{"text":"Cute. Great food... If I was to rave about one item, it would be the seared ahi app.  It is not overly seasoned, so the natural flavor a just come alive in the fish:) plus it is cooked well- not overly done."}
{"text":"When you're at the August Wilson Center for a 7 pm show, and you have a blind lady in tow, your choices for dinner within walking distance are extremely limited in this block of downtown. So after trying to view options up and down the block without walking in circles, we opted to give Tonic a try since it was directly on the opposite corner from August Wilson Center.  We walked in, and were greeted by a friendly staff member, and given a seat.  The atmosphere was rather pleasant, or at least the decor. It was clean, the staff was friendly, the seats were fine. The background music and conversation (downstairs) were not obnoxious or overpowering. The two giant screen TVs with incessant sports coverage were obnoxious, but they always are, and seem to be ALWAYS present in da burgh. But even with the sound turned off, I swear I could feel them trying to leech out as much of my IQ as they could.  We perused the menu, which seemed to be VERY basic, with appetizers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and very few 'meal' options, and the prices were a tad outrageous for such 'basic' options.  We ordered our sodas (thanks goodness, Coke product people), and I ordered a burger, and my friend the fish and chips.    The service staff was very friendly, including the trendy new boy in training who did a little boogie dance in the dining room...he was in a GOOD mood.  The gal that was training him was a little more subdued, but I gathered that it was one of her last days before moving on to another job. Together, they provided excellent service. And the new boy was kind of adorable in his way.  Then came the food. The 'Gourmet' burger boasted of being 8 oz of Kobe beef, with mushrooms and cheese, bacon and caramelized onions, and came with a side of fries.  I opted to leave off the onions, and ordered the burger medium rare.  The fish and chips was two big blobs of fried fish, a mound of fries, and a small bowl of cole slaw.  The burger was NOT fresh. The difference between fresh meat and frozen meat can be clearly seen with asking for it with any level of 'rare'. Fresh meat in a state of rare comes pink, frozen comes grey no matter HOW you ask for it, and this burger was grey. The bun was a little dried out, and the burger itself had very little flavor except for the over-abundance of artificial garlic or liquid smoke they used to season it. It was the kind of fake seasoning that created the cloud of garlic stench that surrounded me and fellow adjacent theater attendees for three hours of play, and several hours of a gassy stomach.  The fries were fine, though clearly out of a bag of frozen processed and seasoned fries. And the burger didn't come with lettuce or tomato. This was $11.50.  The fish and chips were also of the freezer bag variety. My friend ate one lump of fish, and gave the other to me, which gave me soggy greasy breading, and a rubbery and flavorless fish. She had a bigger mound of fries than me, but they were the same freezer bag fries, and the slaw just looked kind of vinegar based. This was $15.  Now, when you can get the best burger in town at Winghart's in Market Square which is real fresh ground beef, made truly to order, with actual flavor, for $7.50, why would you even try to go all 'bistroid' with a fakey and substandard frozen burger for $11.50?  And this was the least expensive burger on their list!  Same goes for the fish and chips. If you're going to pretend to be all uppity, then by gosh, make it fresh from scratch if you're going to charge a gourmet price for it.  One thing that I'm really starting to notice in the process of writing these reviews is that it truly seems that the higher the price goes in da burgh, the more mediocre it becomes, and as I've stated in multiple reviews, I don't give two hoots about your 'atmosphere'. I'm going for the food. And if the food is overpriced and substandard, I'm gone.  This was definitely a FTLT (first time, last time) visit."}
{"text":"Great place to go for drinks!  All their drinks are made with fresh squeezed juices and they are all delicious!  This is not a fine dining restaurant so don't expect it to be.  The food is good, but I go here more for the cocktails and bar scene.  If you are looking for a good drink and a snack then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Pittsburgh area for the weekend. Packers will be in town playing Steelers so figured I would enjoy the city. Went to another bar for drinks and was feeling a bit hungry so stopped in.  The kitchen was closing in 2 mins so luckily the bartender lets us order a few select items. Figured we would order the wings since that seemed pretty quick. The wings were ok at best. Felt like the wings were just warmed up and smothered in BBQ sauce. My friend bf enjoyed his wings but mine were a little pink on the inside and didn't seem cooked to me.   The service was fine and the bartender was attentive. Overall, not sure if the food was just rushed but would be willing to try again."}
{"text":"I was at the convention center and stumbled in here for lunch. Good carnitas tacos and the service was quick. I'd go again if I'd be there for a meeting."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Westin, try this place out! I like this place a lot. The food is very tasty and reasonably priced. I travel a lot and stay across the street at the Westin.  Great option when you are looking for healthy, quality, and affordable meal options. When you sign up for the Tonic card you get a free cocktail with a $10.00 minimum purchase. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Another disappointing dining experience downtown. To be fair, most people probably come to Tonic for the drinks which is the smart move because the food is borderline inedible. We started off with the nachos which were decent, but it takes some talent to mess up tortilla chips and queso. For my entree, I ordered the veggie burger which is literally a defrosted Boca burger thrown on a bun - clearly there was zero effort. I also ordered a side of tomato soup which I'm not even sure can be considered tomato soup. It was strangely clumpy and had an odd taste to it. Steer clear of the soups! My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and it was burnt....like completely charred black. Makes me wonder who is running the kitchen....  Keep an eye out for overcharges! A week after, I found on my bank statement that I was overcharged $10 on my meal. Perhaps it was a mistake or the waitress tried to sneak herself an extra tip, but I made sure to call and get that refunded. Not cool, man, not cool."}
{"text":"Tonic is an ok place and to me there's nothing really that special about it. They're often busy and packed but of course the location has everything to do with that. Across the street from the Westin hotel which connects directly to convention center, this makes Tonic a perfect tourist stop. Food is basic, decent as our the drinks and pricing. Nothing special."}
{"text":"We went there for light up night and they were fairly dead. They had live music upstairs and there were about six people up there. The acoustics of the place don't really warrant live anything, as you can't hear anything well because of the minimalistic design only having hard, flat surfaces throughout the restaurant. Our party was pushed to sit up there, even though there were plenty of tables downstairs where you might have been able to hear if the folks sitting at the bar weren't screaming to greet each and every person coming in.  After catching a bit of attitude for asking to sit downstairs and \"forcing\" a server to clean one of the many dirty tables, we got our drinks and asked for another minute to order. When we finally placed our orders, a few questions were asked about recommendations and, as we found out when we finally were paying the check, neither half off burgers or the special on wings was told to us. Even when one of us ordered a burger, there was no mention that it was half off. And with how ridiculously small a nine dollar salad was, and that's the price without a protein, I would have ordered a burger for half price. The full order Caesar salad I ordered was exactly the same size as the side salad my girlfriend ordered. The one she ordered and they had forgot she ordered.  Overall it wasn't a pleasant experience. We just wanted our check so we didn't miss the fireworks, but even that was slow going. The soup, French onion, was the best part of the meal. The rest of the food was fairly bland. I remembered their food being pretty good and flavorful, but the last time I had eaten there was before they remodeled the place."}
{"text":"Furry watch 2013 happened here. Seems to be a trend to come here during furry week for me. I think next time I'll go to Sonoma Grille and spend the extra $$ for friendly service and good food.   This was actually the first time I had eaten here. I had heard the rumors of great sweet potato fries. Those rumors proved to be true. They were really great. Sweet with a touch of spicy. And whatever that honey sauce they served with it... I practically liked it clean. And stole my friends container of it too.   But the rest of the experience, not so great. I ordered a veggie wrap as well and it was pitiful. Pretty much spinach with a few red peppers tossed in the mix and a dollop of hummus. It was very bland and really in sad shape.   Our server was also not very happy with us towards the end. I will tell you exactly what happened so as not to confuse the situation. Was it busy? Yes. Was she friendly up until the check issue? Yes. Do I understand how things work because I've been a server before? Yes!  So the problem... there were 5 of us ladies who, of course, did not have much cash with us. She told us at first the system \"couldn't process\" more than 3 cards and cash payment split between us. She left us to figure things out. She comes back and we asked her if we could pay with 2 cards and cash, and she said no, their policy is that during conventions or busy times, they just don't split bills or payment. A little bit conflicting? Yes. She also told us the policy is on the menu. Now I cannot attest to whether it is or not, but I would be curious to know.   Now I understand that in some instances places prefer you to pay in cash in a larger group, but usually they will tell you that at the beginning of the meal. This did not happen. I guess what I'm trying to say was that there were holes to the story. Whether it is restaurant policy or not, I just don't think it was communicated properly. She was clearly frustrated with us and it was a bit of a frustrating situation.   I could be persuaded to come back for the sweet potato fries, but I'm coming with cash next time, lesson learned!"}
