{"text":"Great place to go and have a beer, good food and overall a great time. We are there almost on a biweekly status and they never let us down."}
{"text":"Came with the family for some boneless wings - sweet girl sat us quickly and got the high chair - and then we sat with no help . The restaurant wasn't even half full - 10 min went by and each waitress looked at us from their bar hang out and walked right on by - finally when the table on our left had to stand up and flag down a waitress for another beer we decided it wasn't worth staying and we left - some of the poorest service I've seen in awhile."}
{"text":"Food great, app is great but watched the bartender \"find\" a pack of cigarettes and \"regift them\" to another patron.  When the original patron came back in I watched the bartender lie to the original patron and convince him a empty pack of marlboro lights was all he left.  I then asked the bartender when the other two parties where away \"didn't you give his cigarettes to the guy next to me?\" he confirmed he did but didn't know how to handle it.  I mentioned to the manager outside so as not to cause a scene.  I will follow up with the original patron - they should have comped him as much as cigarettes cost - I hate smoking - but i fear they didn't....."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Great food and cold beer. The staff is always very friendly and the happy hour prices are great. I have been here with and without my kids and it is always good."}
{"text":"We have always had good food and service at Bambinos. After having such a bad experience elsewhere I feel the need to do some positive reviews on places our family enjoys. We also recommend the green chili pork burrito. Great job Bambinos, keep up the good work. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We used to LOVE this place.  But service absolutely is awful.  We asked for a glass of ice and we had to repeat our request three times.  The bar service is spotty and disinterested.  It's almost like we're a problem for showing up.  Used to go all the time now not so sure."}
{"text":"Jason the owner and his family are always welcoming customers in the door at this local neighborhood sports bar. It's a great environment, lots of TVs, great food(Baseball pizza) and kid friendly. You want good chicken wings and a great sports bar with fast and friendly service then I would recommend Bambinos to you and your friends. Oh yeah and really cold beer, if you drink!"}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting this establishment.  The first two were mediocre... but sufficient enough  to come back for beer and late night food. My third visit is what drove me to write this review. I was with a group of friends on a week night for food and drinks... we had a terrible experience. Someone ordered the quesadilla and it arrived with out cheese... this was not the main issue.  The manager came back with the plate asking \"what is the issue there is cheese\"  He decided to come over more than once to push back on what our issue is with the food.  If a customer does not like their food... don't question.

Overall. It would be a great neighborhood bar if the food could step up its game and managers were not brasive to their customers."}
{"text":"We came here for UFC on a Saturday. There was a nice amount of people yet we were able to get two seats at the bar. Plenty of TVs offered good viewing. As vegetarians we were able to find something to eat off of the menu: nachos for him and tostadas for me. The food quality was above average for bar food with prices to match. The availability of a veggie burger would have been nice.

Drinks were fine and they had a good selection of beers on tap. Service was friendly and efficient. We finished the evening with a large, warm chocolate chip cookie a la mode... we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came looking to get out on a Sunday afternoon,  while still staying close to home. I was specifically looking for trivia and found out they have NTN (super yay!). Lots of TVs for the sports watchers. I loved the tablet trivia devices (you just have to ask for one). 

We ordered the pork ribettes w/Asian sauce. They blew our minds, they were THAT good. Thick-cut, fall off the bone, just wow. I'll be back for those alone ($10). The $7 queso was \"meh\". Not bad, just not at all remarkable. Service was fine enough, but slow at the end, when you are looking for refills, more food orders, and finally closing out. When the place is fairly dead, there really isn't much of an excuse. (Sorry staff, but that was the main low point.)

Homey interior for a neighborhood bar (brick wall is a nice touch). I hope this place stays in business.  This area needs more non-chain establishments.  Download their app for deals and coupons or check in on Yelp for $5 off. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always had a good experience with food and service. A friend and I recently met for lunch and I had the chicken quesadilla. It was really good! Service was great. Our server was very pleasant and attentive. A great local place!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in and tried the place with my wifey today. We ordered the ava's famous fish tacos they were very good with great flavor. We also ordered the Balk-Balks sliders again very flavorful. Waitress was very nice and attentive. Nice sport themed bar. Better then most with games not the same thing on all tvs a good variety of different sports."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Bambinos 3 times so far since moving to the neighborhood about a month ago and we have not been disappointed, the menu has a lot of variety, the food is really good, the service has been excellent and it is a very comfortable atmosphere, we are happy to have a place like this close to home."}
{"text":"I've been twice now to bambinos and both times have been a positive experience.
The food was delicious and the wait staff friendly. 
It's great place to take the family and enjoy good food."}
{"text":"We've been here dozens of times with usually good or very good feedback (which is obviously why we keep going back). The last 3 times we were here we have had really bad service. Nice girl but bad server. The last 3 times she got at least one of our meals wrong, not a huge deal but still somewhat annoying. Our drinks also sat empty for a little to long, again not a huge deal.... Last night was my final attempt...after our table of 7 had to ask numerous times for enough silverware and napkins ( she deliver 4 napkins when we asked for some), She delivered my son the wrong chicken strips and instead of redoing them she just gave him the correct sauce ( he wanted BBQ and was given hot so not a great idea). We finally had to ask for a new meal for him. She also deliver the wrong sandwiches to my wife and her friend so they just swapped sandwiches from their plates. Drinks remained empty for a little to long. Had to ask the manager ( or husband of owner as I understood it) for refills..... Bill not coming... She's not available to ask for it.... ( keep in mind there are only 2 other groups in the restaurant portion....)  asked the manager guy for the bills.. Finally she shows with it. .. She attempts to charge me for the wrong meal she delivered. No just the meal but also the replacement meal!!! So I ask her if she meant to charge me for the replacement?? She said no and went to take it off... Again, I used to be a server so all the above not a huge deal..... Here is my final straw.. Walking out the manager was standing at the hostess station with his arms crossed. I mentioned to him our experience this time and the 2 prior times and mentioned that if she's our server next time we will probably go somewhere else ( Humble Pie is 50 feet away and has better food)  so he tells me. \"Well then why don't you just ask for a different server\"... What the heck ! Not a \"hey sorry about you bad experience\".... Not a \" hey I'll talk to her and make sure she corrects her oversights\"... 
So I'm done and will strongly suggest to the at least 12-15 other friends I know that go there often to also stop going there. 
The new Zips on 59th ave and the 101 is great and new so that'll be my new spot."}
{"text":"Decided to give Bambinos a second chance once we were told they now had happy hour specials... Specials still do not help me choose Bambinos over Humble Pie or Buffalo Wild Wings.  To me the beer and food is over priced, even with these so called \"Specials\" they have.  Especially appetizers, wow, I can't believe how pricey those are.  Unless they lower prices and have better specials, this family on a budget will not be going back.  I will be a Humble Pie (better specials) or Buffalo Wild Wings..."}
{"text":"We took the kids, ages 3 and 5 to get out of the house and watch the hockey game. Great kids menu (real food) and great BLT and awesome nachos. The chips are thick so they didn't get soggy.  Menu looked yummy and priced well. Great atmosphere and patio area for when it cools down. Looks like it would be fun later in the night (with kids at home). Happy hour m-f 4-7 I think. Great local option!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for mimosas and breakfast on football Saturday.   The food exceeded my expectations in quality.  Service was above average.  Outdoor seating small but a nice option for a cool morning.  I would recommend it for a sports bar!"}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews on service.  We were there again last night and had great service.  The food is fantastic and prices are reasonable.  My only complain is the queso, it's pricey for the size and wasn't good, neither are their chips.  If you skip the apps and go right to a meal, the sandwiches are fantastic, the salads are incredible and I have heard that the street tacos are great too.  We love having Bambinos n the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been coming here since they opened and it is consistently DELICIOUS!
The street tacos are amazing and I love the salsas and guac!  They also have great burgers and chicken sliders...so fresh and flavorful!  The beer is cold and the staff is always friendly.
Karaoke is hilarious on the weekends!  I also recommend the homemade RANCH...I can just about drink it alone!!  It is exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. The kitchen is SLOW. The food is luke warm at best. The only thing good is the Cider."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price, but check your bill carefully. The last 3 times I was here, I was charged for drinks I didn't order."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good specials, friendly staff. This is a place I would definitely come back to. You want a great atmosphere and sports, Bambino's is the place."}
{"text":"Third time in, each time getting service was a challenge last week I had to go to the bar and ask if I could just place an order with the bartender. Love local places would rather spend my money with a small establishment rather than a Corprate Reaturant. No service after more than 15 minutes, won't be back. If you want someone to take your order go someplace else."}
{"text":"The sliders are to die for!! Just wish they came with a side item. But they were so good. My husband and I each ordered one and hen split it. They were delicious! We will be going back again.  Never been there at night. We've only gone during lunch. Lots of t.v's which is nice."}
{"text":"We came kind of late so it wasn't busy. Nice environment and very friendly staff. The shrimp tacos were very good. My son loved the boneless wings he said to give them 5 stars. Chips and salsa were really good too, nice fresh chips. Salsa was a but spicy but I do enjoy that."}
{"text":"Awesome local place. It's our go to for some awesome food and drinks. Everyone we have taken there has been impressed.!The servers know us by name and Sandra is the bomb! Love her!"}
{"text":"Tried it and was not impressed.  I had a burger that was forgettable, not good, not bad either.  The draft beer selection is fair to poor.  If you are into Budweiser and big screen TV's then this place will work for you.  I won't be going back.  And Rachel,  you could use a personality.  It's called customer service.  Look into it.  You are the sole reason I wont be returning ever."}
{"text":"In phoenix for a training seminar.  In Arizona for the first time.  Wonderful state everyone is very friendly.  We were starving and found Bambinos on line.  Were were starving.  Four went thirsty and starving.  The Millennial water comes up.  Greets us. Takes our drink order.   We then asks what He recommends?    He responds.  \"I dont eat hear I am vegan\".  I have nothing against vegans but that was a dumb state.  Needless to say it set the tone for service the rest of the night.  The food however was very good.  They just need to do some major customer service training"}
{"text":"I try to hit the local places first and this isn't bad.  The food is honestly so so, doesn't appear to be fresh but for the price and a local sports bar it will do.  Service is so so as well, again just a average local place but we'll be back regardless.  If the price goes up I wouldn't come back and I honestly only visit once a month.  If the place was better we might make it a regular spot"}
{"text":"I ordered food to go. It took a little while, which I didn't mind, because I should have just called my order in. I picked up the shrimp tacos, carne asada quesadilla, and chicken strips. I liked the shrimp tacos. They were pretty good. The corn tortillas were soggy by the time I got home, but I live 30 minutes away, so that's understandable. The flavor was nice. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the mild spice. There was some kind of red sauce included, it had no flavor, so I had no idea what it was for. The shrimp had a decent flavor, but were just a little overcooked. It was great with the avocado on top....I was not happy with the chicken strips. There were 3 tiny ones. So, I could have had better chicken for a better price at chick fil a. They were the size of my six year old's tiny hands, and dry and overcooked. I wouldn't get it again. At least I got those for her and she doesn't eat that much, but if I had ordered it just for me, I would have been starving still. They came with some dry carrots and sweet potato fries. Meh. My honey liked the carne asada quesadilla. The guacamole had a touch of spicy flavor to it, that was nice. The salsa was unmemorable. Overall, it was average bar food. I don't really know if I'd be back. The price wasn't that great for what you get."}
{"text":"For appetizers and a drink or two its OK. Party of 8. Our main orders came in 3 different waves 10 minutes apart. Some of the food came out cold (fries). My wife orders their Dive Catch (fish and chips) and she got 3 pieces of fish slightly bigger than a chicken nugget. They ask how you want your burger cooked but they all come out well done regardless of what you said. My patty melt said caramelized onions, but I got fresh onions. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon unless the in-laws really want to."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar... The food is better than a typical sports bar, but not great. Great atmosphere and a great location."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here a couple months ago.  We love supporting our local eateries in the North Phoenix area.  I will say the food was decent being in a bar, but I am having a hard time figuring out why we have not been back in a while.  Then it dawned on me, most bars have their main attraction food or awesome happy hour deal, and I could not muster up what Bambinos has to offer.  Let me think...hmmmm, chyeaah.

I think this will deserve another trip back.  However, the food was good and the venue with many TVs screams NFL on Sundays, NCAA football on Saturdays, and NCAA Basketball in March.  I will be on the look out for some awesome deals or \"what they are known for\" food next time around."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times. It's walking distance to my house. I have found it consistently inconsistent. One night the food is just so-so, one night the bartender is great! One night we see a patron walk out the FRONT door with a glass of wine. (That is a big no-no!) What seems to be a constant is zero visible management on the floor. 

The topper tonight which will never bring me back was the karaoke. I enjoy karaoke. I have done it in the past. The problem here is it way obnoxiously loud. So loud two people sitting on the other side of the establishment could not carry on a conversation. Again, the lack of management is apparent and a problem. An active & visible manager would address that. Such a shame. So close (geographically) but so far away (serving)."}
{"text":"This review is just based on the service and drinks, as we didn't get any food.

Our waitress was a little rude to begin with but we came here because we needed to kill time. I got two margaritas which were good and fairly strong, and my boyfriend got some beers. However, the beer selection wasn't good and our waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about what they had. Then, when we tried to get our check, it took a really long time! They only had two people working the whole place!

Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Service was great! The blonde bartender was spot in and had our drinks and food to us almost immediately. Great place! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The service was EXCELLENT. The food and drinks were very reasonably priced, especially at happy hour.  Live music on a Wednesday night!  Sliders were awesome. Very nice place.  Clean and comfortable.  

Recommend sitting at the bar because waitresses are evil gossips, apparently...

My bartender was so cool... When I mentioned my phone's battery died, she grabbed her travel charger and plugged it in for me so I would have a charge on my way home.  That kind of service is 5 stars in my book!!!  Tip your servers generously. :)"}
{"text":"This isn't a place is come back to anytime soon. The screwball weren't anything I would write home about. It's way to distracting to focus on one game, imo. Cars in the drive-thru that are non stop. The tv/table set up is all wrong too."}
{"text":"Food is much better and healthier than normal bar food.  I have been here several times and have ordered different meals each time and they have all been terrific.  The service is also very good and friendly."}
{"text":"We live in the area and decided to stop in and check out the menu.  The wings were good but, the cheese steak and street tacos where terrible.  So sad to have a kitchen without a chief in the hood.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice place, good prices, and friendly people. I'm not on that side of town too often, but it really hit the spot. I had the buffalo chicken fingers, which were standard bar

I'd return if I'm out that way again."}
{"text":"My wife and I  visited Saturday for lunch and sat at the bar.  Rob the bartender greeted us immediately and proceeded to take our drink order and tell us of the specials for the weekend.  Everything was perfect- food was hot and fresh- beers were ice cold.  My wife and I shared the fish tacos and shrimp/bacon/cheese quesadilla  and we both enjoyed them immensely.  Plentiful portions and friendly service make this a must visit place.  Later during our meal Jason the owner stopped by to check on us.  Nice touch while making sure we were welcome.  Going back again real soon!"}
{"text":"I use to come to this place a lot because I live close to it.  I always found the food to be pretty good and the beers were cold.  However, the food has started to go downhill (i.e. comes out wrong or cold or missing ingredients).  

Finally the straw that broke the camel's back was when the ownership got really proud of their place and took away happy hour on Friday's.  Someone should tell him that happy hour was created for Friday's.  Not that I can't afford the higher prices, but out of principle I would rather give my business to other local bars who still have happy hour on Friday's."}
{"text":"The \"walk off Bloody Mary\" described my experience perfectly. I visited with my boyfriend after reading such rave reviews about the place... It's severely lacking. We were greeted (sort of) by the bartender, Shannon, when we walked in. Since there was no offer to be seated, we went to up to the bar. I ordered the signature drink, as mentioned and he ordered a beer. After waiting 10 minutes (we were 2 of maybe 5 people sitting at the bar), the drinks arrive. I can only say that my drink was very mild - no real flavor - although the mason jar it was served in was pretty cool! What pushed me out the door was the fact that these girls has little to no information on the games/sports that were on today. No idea of channels or start time - let alone who was playing. My boyfriend offered up some info and all Shannon said (with imminent sarcasm) was \"good lookin' out dude\" ... Come on girl, seriously.. You work at a SPORTS BAR! Know what games are on, or at least what time the next game starts. P.S. The creepy looking \"regular\" sitting at the end of the bar -- locking your lips while you look at the females in the bar & the staff, it's weird AF. Chill."}
{"text":"Sooo, I am guessing that all of the great reviews written here were posted by friends or family members of the owners. After being happy to see another option in our area of town we decided to try it. I don't know where to begin!!! First, we were sat down at a dirty table. Second, it took over 10 minutes to even be approached by a server (and they were not very busy). Third, the server had no clue what he was talking about in regard to the menu. He could not even describe the bread my sandwich came on and had to come back to the table twice to correct himself since he had not told me right the first two times. Forth, the food, wow...I'm not sure mediocre even covers it. I ordered the Gonzo which sounded very flavorful but somehow the cook (because it couldn't be an actual chef) managed to make it the most bland tasting sandwich ever. I won't even tell you the disgusting chewy, fatty tendon like thing I bit into and had to spit out in a napkin and the fries were totally undercooked. On a trip to the bathroom there was a dead cricket on the floor. People, don't waste your time or money!!! Do your self a favor and go the BK next door. It's cheaper and better!! Or if you want something a little more upscale Humble Pie (in the same complex) is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Great place.  Good food.  Commendable service.  Friendly.  Will be going back there again soon.  The place is is clean and atmosphere fun.  13 big tvs to see your team play.    Attire is casual and noise level is appropriate."}
{"text":"Food was cold and sent back.  We shared the burger, it wasn't fantastic.  In fact pretty sure that was a frozen patty.  Service was average, food was cold, and food was mediocre.  Highly unlikely I would return."}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood joint that has killer grilled wings. Some of the best I've ever had. They're service isn't the best but we go to spend time with each other close to home while having some decently priced food and drinks. 
We also liked the burger sliders for happy hour and the sweet potato fries are AWESOME"}
{"text":"Worst food and don't even add all the ingredients that were listed on the menu still want 100% of the money for 75% of the ingredients"}
{"text":"We really want to like this place, the atmosphere is great, the staff is SO friendly and helpful and the food was ok.  

One complaint is with their happy hour.  There isn't an actual Happy Hour menu, there were about 4 or 5 items the server named.  The prices of the Happy Hour selection is my biggest complaint.  I ordered the Home Run Quesadilla.  It was decent...grilled onions, green chilis, pepper jack cheese.  It was also $6 on Happy Hour.  It came with little containers of salsa and what it said was quacamole...it was green and smooth.  I think it was some sort of avocado spread, it was not quac.

My husband had the Harry Carey chicken sandwich.  It was \"fine\", nothing special.  He asked for provolone instead of swiss but they didn't have it.  The sweet potato fries were really good.

We really liked the atmosphere and felt welcome with our kids in there, it has a really nice bar area, we would probably come back for drinks without kids.  Lots of tv's, easy to see from most angles.  

Given the amazing attitude of every staff member we came in contact with from the time we walked in the restaurant till the time we left, we will come back and give it another shot.  I would like to try the tacos, I liked the looks of the combinations they have, not your average taco."}
{"text":"Good service. Wings were fatty but good sauce. Got the street tacos that ended up being $11 because I got cheese and sour cream, were horrible. Black beans tasted like someone dumped salt in the pot, chicken was fatty with no flavor. My fiancé got the steak sandwich, fatty grisely steak. Worst quality of meats, sticking to drinking only here."}
{"text":"Great community and neighborly  feel to the place, food is decent, priced on the higher side comparable to the area.
Downfall is need a better happy hour"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love everything we've ever had here. The salads are amazing and every salad dressing is unique and tasty!! The nachos are huge- our teenagers can actually share it and leave full. True- the service is a little slow sometimes- kind of a hit and miss. Management- get on that- because you have a great bar, with great food, and great ambience!"}
{"text":"Service was spotty, queso was cold, chips were stale, and the sliders were burnt. Next time I want to get slapped in the face I'll stay home and do it myself for free."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE baseball fan! This is the place to be if you're a fan of the sport. Set aside from baseball, the food is absolutely amazing! I had the tostadas and my father had the carne street tacos. Both were awesome! The guac is on point!! Servers are great and friendly and the atmosphere overall is 5 stars. This is a must go to!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service and the prices rock! The restaurant is always clean and the patio is great. They have a good menu and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Overpriced in my opinion and totally lacking in friendly customer service. A male server at Bambino's is a total jerk and pompous little boy.

Folks, there are other neighborhood sports bars that actually have a happy hour with decent pricing. Not Bambinos! 

I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a party of 4. Went there for the Fish Taco's. That's where the good stops. The only thing this place is selling is beer and sports (that's why it's a sports bar). If you want food go somewhere else. Sandwiches are pretty much standard, nothing special, priced too high. Had a side of coleslaw that had no flavor at all, period. OK if you have a coupon otherwise try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best, they have games for the kids so that is a plus.... and that's about the only plus I can think of. Drinks are over priced for what you get, food comes out in plastic containers with lids... looks like it's already packed Togo for you ! The worst part of it all.... 8$ for a side of soggy fries ?! Ya, not coming back for that."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came to the restaurant to watch the games and have a few drinks. The hostess was rude and the waiter was not much better. I have been trying out the restaurants in the area and I will this is not one I will give my repeat business to."}
{"text":"Brittany, the bartender, was super nice and so was the neighboring clientele. Fast service and decent bar food"}
{"text":"Found Bambino's when we were looking for a place to watch the Coyotes game. Begrudgingly found a TV we could switch over then waited for someone to come serve us. Fish tacos were amazing, burgers were alright, sweet potato fries were awful (need seasoning) but their guac is fantastic. Our table was later picked up by the nicest, and most attentive waitress. Overall good place; and the Yotes won!"}
{"text":"I did not feel 3 stars were in line for this Sports Bar but I do think they have some potential and I want to see them succeed so I gave the 3 as I think 2 would be harsh. We went in early afternoon on Sunday to grab a bite to eat. I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate it when the host walks you to the closest table and acts like its the only table left in the house. So not a great start for me. I perused the menu for a minute while the server gathered our beverages.  I ordered the \"Diving Catch\" which was described on the menu as Breaded Cod. So I asked our server \"what type of breading on the fish\"?  I thought it a fair question since the menu just says \"breaded\" so it could be something unique such as panko or tempura, etc. she had NO clue, and looked lost but no big deal. When my fish arrived, it looked very good. The breading on the fish was very appealing - light amount of breading, nicely brown, not too heavy, looked just right so it should have been great, but it was actually pretty flavorless. The fries were nice size but they are NOT steak fries despite what the menu claims but somewhere in between a regular fry and a steak fry.  Highlight of the trio was the Blue-cheese Slaw. Wife had the cheese steak Sandwich appropriately named \"Bambino\". Looked better than what I ordered!  Lots of meat and good flavor. So 1 out of 2 was good. Service was adequate but when I told her the fish had no flavor she looked completely lost again so I have a feeling that there is not a lot of training going on with regards to food preparation or customer service. Lastly, my wife noticed some cleaning efforts that lacked any hygienic standards so that didn't help the overall score.  So they have a nice looking place but seem not to have a credible plan to be serious sports bar like Padre Murphy's."}
{"text":"We come here on a regular basis and normally have a good experience, unfortunately tonight we came in for karaoke like most Friday nights to sit in a half filled bar for over 30 minutes without even being acknowledged. A member in our group even got into the song rotation and sang a song before I finally decided to approach the gentleman that appeared to be the manager. After telling him how long we had been waiting he said ok. It took a couple more minutes before he came out from the area by the bar to help us himself. Shortly after he took our drink order a waitress came over to ask if we needed a drink or something and when we said our order had literally just been taken she left in a huff and we didn't see her again. The manager brought us our drinks but was more interested in being on his cell phone to take care of customers. It's really unfortunate because we have been coming here since they opened but the new staff and management need a lot of help because of it continues like this we will not return."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always had good food at a fair price with good service. Today ordered the fish tacos for the first time. Not much of meal for 9 bucks. Two small (approx. 6\" round) tacos with some chopped fried fish mixed in with a lot of cabbage with a small dish of coleslaw. Had a tasty chipotle sauce on the tacos though. Picked up the first one and attempted to bite in, but before I could it literally fell apart in my hands. Had to eat the tacos with a knife and fork. Only reason for the two stars is for the service not the meal."}
{"text":"We were so happy to see a neighborhood Sport Grill open up. We have been there about 15 times. The food is always good if you like sliders, burgers and some mexican dishes. Bar Food.  They can be rude if you ask for a substitution on a slider (for dietary needs). The menu says No Substitutions but that ridiculous!! The service tends to always be bad. From the Hostess to the waitress and we have NEVER seen a manager. Your meal will take longer than normal due to waitstaff issues so have time on your hands."}
{"text":"Good place to drink and watch sports (though their beer selection left something to be desired). But the food isn't good. Eat dinner before/after watching the game here."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour on a Friday evening. Nice that happy hour runs until 7:00. It was busy, but not overly crowded. Greeted and seated promptly. Everyone was very friendly.  The shrimp applewood bacon quesadilla we ordered was excellent. Good beers on tap and the Suns playing on one of the many TVs. This will be our go to sports bar from here on out."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been waiting for something nearby to open so we were excited to check this place out this past Saturday. The first thing that struck me as odd were the hours. They close at midnight on weekend nights. Ok, whatever, not a deal breaker as most games are over by then. At first our service seemed decent enough. She brought our drinks fairly quick and our dinner arrived not too long after we ordered. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. 

This is pretty much where the service ended. Not once did she check on us to fill our drinks or anything. I could see her hanging out in back chatting with others while we were waiting for our check. At this point, my wife says to me that one of the managers was sitting at the bar drinking a beer. I can't believe it! Sure enough, I turn around and one of the managers was drinking. A few minutes later I see him \"managing\" some employees. I thought I only saw that stuff on Bar Rescue. 

We will be back only because I believe in giving second chances. Plus, there really isn't anything else like it that is close to home. But our first impression was that we were not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Bambino's Sports Grill is no stranger to me. I've enjoyed more than a few brews here in the past and watched the Super Bowl a few years back with a good friend who lives nearby. It's a really comfortable and classy neighborhood bar. And it's conveniently located to the sports facilities over on Pinnacle Peak Road.

My son and I were in the area this past weekend because his club baseball team was playing in a tournament over at Victory Lane. As a group, the parents (and players) chose Bambino's to grab a bite to eat between games.

We had 90 minutes before we had to be back on the field for warmups, but I was nervous that a sit down establishment would prevent us from staying on schedule. We were a group of 25 and we had one server. Her name is Falyn, and when we informed her of the time constraints, she went right to work taking our orders.

Falyn did an amazing job handling our group! She made sure the orders were in quickly, she delivered most of the food and checked beverages, and she cashed us out quickly. Falyn never looked overwhelmed and kept everything organized for when the check was split. Kudos to her for getting us in and out in about an hour. And kudos to the kitchen for delivering hot and delicious food for everyone.

I was sitting with most of the parents and our coach and they were all remarking about the great menu choices. It is what I would consider, above average bar fare. Way above! And I am happy to say, everyone enjoyed their meal. Naturally, I ordered the \"Wrigley\". A salad with turkey, avocado, bacon and blue cheese crumbles. Second best salad I've ever had!

Thanks to Bambino's for taking care of our crew! Well done! See you again soon."}
{"text":"Great salads, good carnitas, good service, decent alcohol selection, lots of TVs, 2 miles from home. Get little neighborhood sports bar"}
{"text":"Here at 10:00pm and there are three women with very small children singing karaoke, total buzzkill when your trying to relax with your friends without the kids.  This bar should be ashamed letting this happen!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend Zach loves this place!! He goes here often for business lunches and he always comes home and raves to me about how good the food is!  He says it is not typical sports bar food.  it is actually fresh food and a wide variety of menu options!

So he finally took me there one night to show me what it is all about. We went to watch the UFC fights and had no trouble getting a table since we arrived early.  There were plenty of TV's to watch.  The ambiance was awesome! Beautiful brick behind the bar and lights all around. It was very classy for a sport grill.

We got a few rounds of drinks, all of which were great.

The food was excellent!! It definitely met my expectations after all the hype.

Overall, we loved it here and would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Came to Bambinos to watch the NLCS, clearly a baseball themed sports bar, unfortunately, they couldn't manage to nut up and turn the volume on the game that had the two best teams in the NL for the last 5 yrs. we had to watch an NFL game that had no meaning. CHANGE YOUR NAME TO JOE NAMATHS U SUCK"}
{"text":"Excellent Tacos al Pastor!  Good burgers, Good service, Good local sports bar. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Took the family out for dinner and it was the wrong move. The place was very very loud and a lot of people were already drunk by the time we got there which was 6pm. The server we had said Friday nights with this particular group was always rowdy and drunk and to try them a second time just not on Friday nights. Food was ok but again not worth the price, the loudness or the drunk behavior so early. The scary thing is that they kept serving them more beer, shots and wine. We got out of there before they even got out of the place which the server also recommended to us"}
{"text":"I sent my food back twice because the Bambino which is a Philly cheese steak with jalapenos the first time did not come with jalapenos the second time did not come with cheese. The manager comes over says we will not be required to pay for anything but don't come back. I asked why do we not have to come back because your Cooks don't understand that Philly cheesesteaks come with cheese she points in my girlfriend it says oh I think she knows and then proceeds to call her a b****. First off whatever previous history you had my girlfriend suggested the place because the food used to be good. And then when I walked over to the owner and requested the statutory agent information he refused. Terrible service terrible management terrible owner avoid this place the worst possible place you could go eat McDonald's is a step up"}
{"text":"Nice clean sports bar. They put the Red Sox on for us. Not bad considering we were in Arizona. We didn't expect to see them on our vacation. The food was decent, but nothing outstanding. The Margaritas were also nothing special. But, the service was excellent and we had a good time. If I was a local I would probably go back just for the atmosphere. A nice friendly place."}
{"text":"It is nice to have another little watering hole in the neighborhood. Rebecca and Jason did awesome behind the bar, and treated us well.

The place was clean and has TV's all over. I did not get to try the food but it looked good, and I am sure I will try it the next time I am there. 

Short review, but it is a chill little spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check this place out, It's an alright spot, with standard bar food. I ordered a burger, which was good. My gal ordered the asian tacos, which were surprisingly spicy - which wasn't mentioned anywhere on the menu, or by the server until after it was served... Too spicy for her and she couldn't make it through even a single one. Seeing a plate of food uneaten a manager stopped by asking if everything was alright, we explained and she quickly apologized and asked if she could get some thing else for her - very good customer service. When our bill arrived the tacos were voided off and the waitress also apologized.

It's more of a bar than a restaurant in my opinion, but due to the great customer service I'm going to give it another shot and update my review then. If the owner of Bambino's is reading this, please update your menu to include how much heat each entree packs, thanks!"}
{"text":"We went for a friends birthday. We really had a great time. Our waitress was very sweet and took great care of us. Overall, food was pretty good. We had the nachos. Trust me, you want he carnitas on them. Only downfall, I don't like thick corn chips. But, that's just me. We split 3 burgers between us and ordered wings. All were very good. I'm not a fan of plastic cups for sauces, or condiments. It's a really nice place and those look bad. Otherwise we will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Nice to see a sports bar up this way. There are not too many non-chain one. 

Bambinos was a nice clean open feeling place. The server was great did a good job. The food while it appeared to be a little expensive, was really good and worth it. 

I had a Philly, fries and coke. I enjoyed all of it. Nice flavor to the philly."}
{"text":"Well, we tried this place for the second time, with similar results. I want this place to be better (we live down the street), as it has a \"Zipps\" type look to it, but doesn't come close to stacking up. The food is very bland and flavorless, the staff seems unfriendly and too busy to be bothered. The server asked if I wanted a small or large beer, I specifically said small and she brought a large. Instead of just leaving it, she took it back to \"make\" it a small...why wouldn't you just leave it at that point, instead of bringing back a flat, warm beer??? Customer service is not their forte here, I'd recommend Humble Pie or Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"No one wants to hear shitty karaoke every Friday and Saturday! The food sucks! I have had bloody wings!  You safe with the carrots, celery and ranch! The bathrooms are dirty! No seat covers and the main handle to the door are dirty!"}
{"text":"My wife and I and a few other couples went here for a drink after a softball game and the service was very slow and the waitress was very unfriendly. We ordered a Coors light when the beer came to the table it was definitely not a Coors light when we informed the waitress of this she argued with us and said she would not give us a new drink even though every single person at the table was drinking Coors light. The beer wasn't even the same color when we approach the bartender about it she was very willing to replace the drink which is what the waitress should've done in the first place. From the time we went around her to get a new drink to the time we left she didn't come back once we had to ask for our bill in order to leave and the waitress was busy cleaning other tables preparing for close rather than taking care of us. Very disappointing. When I asked the gal that invited us there why they go there they said the service here is terrible but there's never a wait............ Decent atmosphere and in a great location. Hopefully my comments will help someone make some needed changes."}
{"text":"I'm subtracting a star for the recent change made to the happy hour schedule, in which Friday has been removed. Who only has happy hour Monday-Thursday? Sadly, we will take our business elsewhere on Fridays from now on."}
{"text":"My first experience at Bambino's might be the last.  The atmosphere was open..but the sound system was spotty.  Server greeted us within 3 minutes and took our drink order, but not very interactive.  No welcome how are you...found they had a special by listening in on another conversation.  Food was Luke warm..I hate fries that wilt and fish cooked in old grease.  Server came back to ask if we needed anything once.  Bill paid ...no thanks for coming in.  I didn't feel like they were excited about getting our business.  This is a local bar and grill...get to know your customers .  Slow nights like tonight give you the opportunity to do 
just that.   I will give them another try because they are right around the corner"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been looking for a place to catch a game and a pint close enough to our house to bike to, and this just might fit the bill.  The design of the bar/restaurant looks like something that you would see on the show Bar Rescue, but Bambino's is the \"after\" outcome.  It looks that good.  We chose the shrimp/bacon quesadilla which was tasty, but there was way more bacon compared to shrimp.  The buns on the sliders we ordered were quite crispy and had a little too much butter on them.  We were looking forward to the chocolate cookie dessert with ice cream on top, but were a little disappointed.  The cookie was huge but it tasted very \"floury.\"  It wasn't heated up enough, so it was hard on the outside and softer on the inside.  I think it would have been better if the cookie was half-baked when you order it instead of just heated up.  The drink specials were really good and we are looking forward to returning for happy hour.  We'll have to try other menu items to see if we like them more than what we had the first time."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 4.5 stars they have improved drastically in their consistency, food quality and service...super friendly wait staff who recognize their regulars and their usuals...very enjoyable experience every time for the last few months!! Good job!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and a really nice atmosphere. The owners are friendly and care about the good they serve. This is not just your regular bad food. I highly recommend Bambino's."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection, never a bad seat when watching games and the service is always awesome! Keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4 stars, just because I love baseball and the Great Bambino is all over the walls. 

Service: 1 star, I ordered a burger with one other patron in the place. My server, apparently the owner, forgot my order three times having to real me. Drinks were never refilled and I sat waiting for a bill. 

Food: 1 star, the burger was similar to a college party burger. Frozen patty, cheap bun, fatty. Just bad. 

Cleanliness: 2 stars, I was there when they opened so everything was clean. But then they allowed two children to go behind the bar to serve themselves pop. They touched everything and even coughed and sneezed once. Having been a child, I know we should not tough anything related to food, especially the ice in my drink!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go for happy hour. They have some really great specials if your looking for just a quick bite. We have never had a wait when we stop in which I love! They also have giant garage doors they will open up when the weather is a little cooler and a small patio of you choose to sit outside.

I normally get the happy hour boneless wings which are an amazing deal and are quite tasty. I also tend to frequent the fish tacos which are absolutely delicious! I was honestly quite surprised how good they were from a sports bar type setting. The screwball sliders are also phenomenal!! Very sad they took those off the happy hour menu! 

Happy hour beers are also a really great deal however I wish they would rotate some of their craft beers more. They seem to always have the same ones every time we go."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. I had the shrimp and bacon quesadilla and G had the wings. My quesadilla was excellent and G said he had never had wings like these before (maybe they weren't fried? Not sure.), but that wasn't a bad thing because he said he would order them again. We must have gotten some kind of happy hour pricing because both of our items were $6 - what a nice surprise when our check came! 

Our food and drinks came promptly and the service was good. I was surprised by how sweet the hostess was. I felt like the menu was reasonably priced - I don't remember anything being over $10; but the kid's meals seemed a bit pricey at $5.49. Still, Bambino's seems like the perfect, family-friendly neighborhood bar. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has become my local watering hole! Bambino's has a pretty darn good happy hour and very friendly service. I'm a big Bronco fan and when they are not shown on national TV this is my spot to watch the Super Bowl champs dominate!!!"}
{"text":"Went there to watch the UFC fight. Had to pay $5.00 this time but that was ok with me. Great wings and food but on nights like this they need to double up the staff. Waited way too long for refills. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty empty. We ordered and one bite and we were hooked. Burger was seasoned perfectly! Carne Asada was amazing. Service was quick we had our food in less than 10 mins. You have gained new regulars!"}
{"text":"We used to go here after every softball game on Thursday Nights. The atmosphere is  nice and clean, very welcoming. Service has always been great. Food is always god no matter what I order. drinks are always a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Yummy shrimp and bacon quesadilla and sweet potato fries. Good value. Spacious, nice sports bar. Friendly staff. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is a little bland, but it's clean & nice. I been here a few times & I order the Pork Wingettes every time, they are delicious. I buy a big bag of them from a wholesaler to grill at home & this is the only place (that I know of) in town that serves them - $10 for 10 Wingettes!!! No disappointments here!!!! Try 'em, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Thought of trying this place many times. Big mistake! The hosts takes us to a table near the bar which was perfect so that we could watch a hockey playoff game. The table top was filthy, crumbs, food, etc.  She hands us one menu and leaves. We decide to sit at the table next to it. She comes over and tells us we can't sit there because it's a different server! Ok, can you at least clean the table we \"have\" to sit at. She comes over with a wet soaked towel and wipes the table and leaves. Completely soaked table top! I'm already ready to leave but instead go to the bar to get napkins to wipe the table. Should have left then. Chips and salsa, or diced tomatoes from a can?      Horrible. The two sandwiches were actually pretty good. Here's the kicker. 2 minutes left in the playoff hockey game we had been watching directly in front of us and some idiot changes the channel without asking anyone if they were watching the game!!!!  Really????  This just confirms when there isn't any other option in an area any business will survive. 

I do want to add that the server we had was really good. She new we weren't happy and was as nice as can be."}
{"text":"Average sports bar will subpar service. Found a gross long hair in my nachos and have never been back."}
{"text":"Love it!

My husband and I love the atmosphere, the servers and the tacos.  We have been there by ourselves and have enjoyed watching a game or with friends where it is easy to converse and have fun!"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, great service, plenty of TVs, and awesome sliders!"}
{"text":"I like this lil spot.  Came in for a light lunch a few weeks ago. I got the ribblets which were pretty good.  Only thing is they came with cucumbers which I found a lil weird.  The prices seemed to be pretty fair.  The service was good and timely.  Looks like a good place to catch a game or chill with the fellas after work.  The In Laws live within walking distance and this seems to be the  only bar with in walking distance so I can have a few and just hoof it back to the house.  That night I cam back for some coldies.  They have a few craft beers which always helps when you don't want a bud light.  They   had karaoke going  but it was kinda dead.  They made a good first impression so that means anytime I am in the Stetson Hills 'hood Lilmark gonna stop by."}
{"text":"Place has terrible food. Atmosphere is not so great. I wish North Phoenix could figure out how to establish a good bar. Greasy bar food is better than this place. Staff is nice but someone meeds to talk to the owner."}
{"text":"Well let me tell you of the experience of Bambinos and why I won't be back. I have been waiting forever for this place to open up. I was looking forward to a bar in the neighborhood. So when I saw they opened, we went Friday evening - 2 days after they were open. Walked in and the place looked great. Large TV's adorned the wall behind the bar. I noticed a garage door to open the place up and thought how great it will be to catch a game there in the Fall/Winter. So we sit down, wife, and neighbor and his wife. Friends were late so we ordered the nachos. $6.99 and if you want meat, add $3 bucks. We went meatless. Took a while but it came out and was decent. A bit undersized but it was OK. Guacamole was pureed and had very little flavor. Neighbors show up and order the chips and queso. Queso was really good. Where this went south was the chips were about a handful. We finished off the chips and still had queso left. I asked for more chips. The waiter (good Kid who was really trying) said OK, left and returned a few minutes later and told us that according to the owner he would have to charge us for extra chips. REALLY?  So let's see you are open for 2 days, the place isn't even full and you aren't willing to let go of 25 cents worth of chips to appease a new customer? Needless to say, I was pissed. Like i told the waiter, that was Strike 1. So we order up and now all four of us are ready to try the burgers. Menu seemed attractive with the typical bar food aptly named after baseball people. I went for the Patty Melt. Wife and buddy had burgers. Neighbors wife had chicken strips. We all concluded the burgers were just OK. Mine was a very small patty and a smattering of sweet potato fries. Chicken was \"tough\". So, the hopes of a good local bar that I could walk to is dashed.  We all concluded it was not worth coming back
Positives: Waiter was friendly, good looking bar and what every sports themed bar should have TV's and Cold beer.
Negatives: See above. 
Also at the end the waiter asked us how the food was as the owner wanted to know. The guy was standing there the entire time and could have come over and asked but he chose not to. In fact I never saw him speak to any guests and this place is very small. 
I can only hope this was an anomaly but someone else is going to have to convince it is worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Garbage service every time. Keep trying to come back bc it is in my neighborhood but 14/15 times, slow service-good is decent. Server literally walked out and left her shift, waited 35 minutes to ask for someone to give us our tab. So sick of awful service. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT!!!! Worst place to eat!!!!! Use to eat there a lot and had amazing food 3 years ago, now boyfriend had to send back his food twice because they kept making it wrong. First time didn't have jalapeños which it said on the menu, 2nd time didn't have cheese on a Philly cheese steak. Owner came over and said \"apparently you're not happy with anything so you need to leave and not come back\". Ended up calling me a bitch and taking the food we did have in front of us from the table......NEVER EAT here. Food is not the same that I remember, it is shit now"}
{"text":"Good little neighborhood bar. They were out of chicken fingers and substituted boneless wings for us. Out of chicken strips.... Oh well. boneless wings are good too"}
{"text":"Update: We tried this place again on 8/9/17
Food was much better, but the Sever was an absolute nasty, unfriendly person .. whadd tude on her !!  Husband asked for a beer, they didn't offer, and she never came back to ask if we wanted a different brand .. So, IF we go back, I will never be seated with her, long black hair and a nasty confrontational attitude !!  Chick, if you tip sucked, you better know it was because of you !!!  

For a Sports Bar, they will never have a PPV Sport on.  Also, not sure if under New Mangement, but the Burgers WERE so good and they are now these flat ( i'm sure frozen) things,  We use to go for the food and now are searching for another local Sports Bar with great food.  Been a huge turn over in the wait staff as well ..,. hoping they get it back together !!"}
{"text":"So, this is my third visit and so far, my first visit has been the best. I have always ordered their \"famous\" fish tacos. First visit, the fish was plentiful and crispy. Second visit, not as much fish, but, still pretty tasty. My last visit, fish was cut into really small pieces and then there was a pile of coleslaw dumped on top! I ordered coleslaw as my side which confirmed my suspicions that that is what they used on top of their fish tacos! So, needless to say, I will not go back for their fish tacos."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the worst places I've ever been. I just witnessed two Glendale dweebs karaoke duet Linkin Park. I don't think I've ever been to a worse bar. This is the only place in this area and I would legitimately have more fun sitting at home with my kid watching Pokémon. Can't speak for the food, came here at night for the 'bar scene' .... it sucks"}
{"text":"Awesome new sports grill!  I had the cheeseburger with chipotle mayo and fries... it was really good and the beer was super cold.   I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Bambino's has plenty of TVs and almost any sports channel imaginable. The atmosphere was very family friendly, at least during the day. Our waitress was very kind, helpful, and prompt and we received our food pretty quickly after ordering. The food can be described as meh. It was not too flavorful and certainly not anything that would warrant a return visit. Our family ordered the sliders, the Bambino sandwich and a kid's item. Pepper lovers will love this place since most items on the menu have some sort of peppers. 
This may be a great place for a drink, trivia, or to catch a game, but we will not be back for the food."}
{"text":"Great food, service, customers, regulars and ambiance. Consistently the place we turn to for quality and a great experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Sunday afternoon meeting for a drink.  It's a pretty cool little place when you first walk in.  Lot's of sports memorabilia.  We ordered the nachos which were just average.  It wasn't very busy so we were surprised that our order took forever to come out.  The drinks were great-service not so much.  I'm thinking it is because it was a slow time & they had someone filling in.  He didn't seem to know much about service.  I will prob go back & try it again before I make a final decision."}
{"text":"That's supposed to be roast beef sliders  never had roast beef anything that looked or tasted like that!! Won't be eating here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Good place and food. Some deals as well and overall there has always been room but they do stay busy on a regular basis. No complaints on food or service as they have always been spot on overall. Another regular place that my friends, girlfriend and I go."}
{"text":"Last night was our third time to Bambinos.  I love this place.  It's casual, hostess and servers are very friendly and checked with us periodically..  We have had the wings, fish tacos, chicken sandwich, salads.  No complaints and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Good food, cold drinks. good place to watch some sports"}
{"text":"I'm not seeing any problems with this place so not sure what the negative reviews are about. Service was amazing, food was tasty, prices were fair and the facility is brand spanking new. I will definitely be back. This is a very large building. But it's pretty much the only bar in the neighborhood so I think it will be successful. I'm really hoping they do karaoke and/or live music on the weekends. Waitress said they've only been open a couple weeks so they're still trying to figure out what to do. I'd like to suggest a live jazz night Friday and karaoke Saturday :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a sport's bar opening close by.  They frequently have UFC fights and everything we have tried has been tasty, our favorite is the fish tacos.  Servers have always been friendly and the atmosphere is open without feeling empty.  Only thing I can knock them on is that the food and margaritas are a little pricey.  Great place to watch a game or grab a drink with a friend."}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews and I've been meaning to do this for quite some time. Bambinos, at one time, was our favorite neighborhood spot! Since it was so close to home we would go there with our family or friends 2+ times a week!!! With friends, our table could get up to 14 people! We loved supporting our local restaurant/bar!!!! We had bad service 1 too many times and when the manager was addressed with the problem, he just shrugged it off like \"oh well!\" If the manager had dealt with the bad service differently we would still be going there today (along with all of our friends and family) we all choose not to step foot and support them any longer! We have found a new place!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Not many local non-chain options around here. Bambino's is a refreshing option! Great sports bar with great food!"}
{"text":"After giving this small place my typical 3 at bats before ruling them out, I have had it. Im done. The management is non-existent and when they are around, they dont give a damn about running a restaurant or customer service. The bartender I had last time was a snotty little b**** that acted like I was an inconvenience. Too bad.. the food has been decent each time I went. Its a shame to see a small local place open then start losing it over customer service. The easiest thing to fix. I think the only reason why this place is even still open is lack of options for locals."}
{"text":"What a great place to have in this area!  The restaurant feels very fresh and new with a subtle sports theme.  There are plenty of TV screens for the sports fans and you can bring the family in as well.   The food is high-quality for a sports bar, but not pricey.  I was able to take advantage of happy hour prices that went until 7:00.  I was impressed by the variety; tons of different sandwiches, salads, appetizers, and street tacos.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  They offer trivia on Wednesday nights (7:30p) through Team Trivia.  The trivia is free and you can win prizes!  Super fun!"}
