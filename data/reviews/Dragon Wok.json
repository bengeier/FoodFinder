{"text":"Tried this place based on the rave reviews.  I do not understand the praise.  Hot & Sour soup was the best part of the meal.  Unlike most places, it wasn't loaded with corn starch and it had a nice kick.  On the other hand, there was barely any vinegar flavor, and it reminded me more of a spicy ramen broth than hot & sour.  Had to eat around the overcooked shrimp.    There was something on the menu called Twice-Cooked Chicken; I expected it to be chicken that was boiled and then stir-fried (like twice-cooked pork) but it was just the battered chicken chunks from the orange/sesame dishes served in a brown sauce.  My fault for not asking.  The cuts of chicken were nice, but the coating was mushy and spongy, as other reviewers have said.  Sauce was bland.    It was hard to pick a vegetarian dish since the restaurant's veggie selection is basically limited to the garnishes that go in the meat dishes.  I went with the Kung Pao Tofu; it had a random chunk of pork in it, and the tofu was so soft it was almost like eating pudding.  Sauce was bland.  Side of fried rice was tasteless.     Restaurant had good ambiance and the wait staff was attentive.  Entrees were $10 for the tofu and $11 for the chicken, which was a bit high relative to portion size.  I feel that Dragon Wok is trying to be an \"upscale\" Chinese restaurant in the model of PF Chang's.  PF Chang's is not one of my favorite restaurants, but at least their menu expands beyond the most basic of carry-out standards and they know how to fry their chicken."}
{"text":"Went in n a Valpak coupon. Had dinner there. It was super slow, but thought maybe because nothing else is open around them.The Super market was closed down. The service was friendly, that's a Pro. the Cons, where do I start. Food was hot on one side, colder on the other or in the core of the meat. Wierd. Food took a lil longer, but that was ok, if it was busy.  It was a lil $$$ for the quality of the food. I will not leave Pei Wei again, I swear. My last thought, we should of ate next door at Los Fav taco shop."}
{"text":"The large wor won ton soup was full of fresh ingredients and was a big serving.  The Mongolian beef, which is supposed to be a spicy dish, was not spicy at all, but was flavorful enough.  The General Chicken, which I've found is a totally different dish at every restaurant, was drowning in sauce, but had a nice little spice to it.  If possible, I would've given 3.5 stars - 4 for atmosphere and service, which were by far the nicest of any of the Chinese restaurants that I've been to in the area so far and 3 for the food."}
{"text":"I do read reviews before going into places as I feel every experience is different and in this case, my family and I were not disappointed. The food was hot and tasty, the service great and we left feeling full and satisfied. We have eaten at alot of chinese food restaurants and this place was fantastic. Will be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. The restaurant is nice and clean with a friendly staff. The one problem is the price, you can spend the same money and get some really good food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The good: Lunch special included main dish, rice/chow mein, and egg drop soup for 6.55. The food was decent.   The bad: We got their a few minutes after they opened, and the table we sat at was dirty. That means it had not been cleaned since (at least) the day before. I looked around and other tables were dirty as well. My mom asked for a rag to clean the table, and the employee didn't even offer to clean it...he literally handed the wash rag to her, and she had to clean our table!   Also, since were dining in, I think our food should have come in something a little more sturdy than the styrofoam to-go packages their take-out comes in.    The ugly: The bathroom. Just gross. My husband had to hover our toddler over the toilet so as not to touch the disgusting filth on the toilet and in the bathroom.   There were tons of boxes piled high that weren't broken down; they were in the dining area and completely visible to anybody who walked in."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, using good ingredients. No corn syrup :) Quality and price are very important to me.  Delivery is good and fast, especially if you get the good driver.  The price to quality ratio whoops every other chinese restaurant.  Guaranteed chinese flutes for your ears listening pleasure."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Quality of food has gone downhill. Ordered Lobster, Scallops and Shrimp plate. Lobster was undercooked, pointed it out. brought me a 2nd dish. lobster undercooked again. didn't eat the lobster but ate the rest. bad idea. got horribly sick. People are really really nice though. probably will give it awhile before I consider going back. won't eat seafood of course"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat chinese food because I can never find a place I like, but this place was pretty good. I noticed after I ordered from this place that they had Fried Scallops!! (If anyone's intrested in that) But I'm definitely trying that next time I order from there."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from the restaurant for a couple years. I used to order it all the time when I worked at the Blockbuster that was down the street from it because it tasted awesome. Lately though the food quality has taken a bit of a turn. The Beef and Broccoli has a great sauce and the broccoli in it is always fresh and crisp, but the beef is another story. It has a strange soggy texture to it that was so off-putting that the last time I ordered it, I had to toss it.  My boyfriend likes the Honey Chicken which also has a really good sweet and spicy sauce but they batter the chicken and fry it. Usually that isn't a problem, but the last time that we ordered it, it was under cooked because we could taste the rawness of the batter. Another thing is that they charge a lot for their food. 14 bucks for under cooked Honey Chicken, no thanks. I can get better tasting and properly cooked food from Chen's or ACE for a lot less than that. All in all I've tasted and had better Chinese food than here for a better price to boot."}
{"text":"This is a great mom and pop place. Sam and Lola do a great job. Clean, Friendly, Relaxing, Great Soups and over all good food/quality. We come here to get soup when we are sick.. I drive 15 miles to get it!  Been eating here about 8 years. Funny to read some of the other reviews... Here is the thing..we have our favorite restaurants, things we like better at one place over another.... my mom and I really enjoy dining here.  No ones lettuce wraps beat PF Chang's, but these are nice. I feel they take pride in what they serve...if you like spicy you can ask for spicier.  I do not hesitate to send food back... I have never sent anything back here.  I have never had cold food here either. **** I am a fan of non-chain places!"}
{"text":"CLOSED. I live close by at N. Hualapai and Alexander intersection. I went there to have my dinner on April 18th 2007 but found the place CLOSED :(  It is a shame since this is the most authentic Chinese eatery I have eaten in in Las Vegas, If someone knows if they shifted elsewhere, please let me know at prasads@pandacs.com.   thanks"}
{"text":"This place is great! They have the best crab puffs in town. They give you enough food for two meals, and it all comes out hot and fresh. I love the walnut shrimp and the honey chicken. You can tell they use quality ingredients. The staff is friendly also!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMYYYY!!!! literally the best chinese food i  have had for a looooong time!!! TRY IT"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times the food is decent for the price ... However i will have to agree with the other reviewer, this place has the WORST service.   The owner/server is rude and dismissive ... she made a mistake with the order (an easily solvable one at that) and refused to fix it, so i shall be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I walked in and stood there with one other person for 10 min,.No one even came up to tell me it would be awile or what, the place SUCKS!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great!  The gourmet beef is delicious.  I love the egg drop soup. The owners are very friendly and always accommodating.  The will change almost any dish to your liking.  I have been going here for 8 years.  The food is always consistent."}
{"text":"We've tried this restaurant 4 times, ever since we \"discovered\" it. Every time we visit we've had different dishes, and everything has been delicious (we're in the process of eating our way through the menu). This has become our new, favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. Not only is the food great, and the portions large, but the service has been wonderful. Last, but not least, the decor is delightful."}
{"text":"we love to order take out.  the food is very tasty, and plentiful."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 1 star I would. By far the worst Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY! The food is not very good but the customer service is awful. I picked up dinner for my family. When I got home I realized that half the order was the wrong order. When I called Dragon Wok the person that answered said bring it back and we will give you the right items. She also told me that I would owe $1.08 that is the difference in price for the correct food. I asked her to deliver the food. She said they would have to wait until the rain stopped and delivery would cost $3. I couldn't believe they wanted to charge me $3 for delivery when this was her mistake. I told her to take the $5 tip I gave her to offset the $3 plus the $1.08. She told me if I want the correct order I would have to pick it up and pay the difference - then she hung up on me. I called back and asked for the manager and was told the manager was not in. We ended up throwing the food away. Even the steamed rice was not good. With so many good Chinese take outs it is not necessary to settle for this place!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum yum yum!!!!  This place is fantastic the food can be pricey especially when you want a taste of everything but everything taste great!   I really don't find it anymore expensive than other Chinese restaurants but again it's hard not to order several of the entrées, you won't be disappointed.  Lo me in and the fried rice are the best! I recommend the wonton soup especially when you're feeling under the weather it's a great alternative to chicken noodle, this is definitely comfort food!"}
{"text":"We had dinner tonight and it was excellent. Everytime we come it's consistent, great dishes full of flavor. Wonderful appetizers and cocktails. The waitstaff is friendly and efficient. The owner and his wife were there and were a pleasure to talk to. Nice family business. We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I was really impressed when we moved into the neighborhood to find this YUMMY chinese place. It is on our list of favorite's now. They have a great assortment of food from pad thai (my favorite) to beef with broccoli.  I am up for their Crab Ragoons next time. The service is always friendly and and the scents as soon as you walk in the door is inviting. The servings are perfect for leftovers!  Even the leftovers are delish!"}
{"text":"My daughter just ordered delivery from this place.  She ordered rice, chow mien, dumplings, and teriyaki chicken for one person.  The delivery man came and charged her $28.  Then argued with her and didn't want to take her money.  He treated her like dirt and said he did not want to count the money.  Yelled at her on the front porch for 4 minutes then snatched the bag of food out of her hand.  Extremely RUDE!  Horrible customer service!  I'm sure the food wasn't that great either.   Not even PF Changs charges $28 for one plate.  Absolutely do not recommend this hole in the wall.  And they prey on your teenage children and hike the prices. The 1 star is because I was forced to."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in AZ. We've been coming here for almost 10 years and it never fails to disappoint. The owners are pretty great too, always make us feel like at home."}
{"text":"I had my order delivered to me and not only was the food DELICIOUS (I got the crab puffs and the shrimp lo mein), the guy who delivered my food was really nice! I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Their crab puffs and shrimp appetizers are delish! Great service. I've come back several times."}
{"text":"Dragon Wok is a true epicurian delight !  The plate presentation is just the beginning  of a great meal. I am a big fan of the *WALNUT SHRIMP*. Warm, savory and a taste  that lingers on your palate. Highly recomend this fantastic Chinese restaurant to all  who are looking for the best!  GO...GO...GO. Owner Sam and his charming wife Lola  are there to serve you the finest fare.        Gary W.   1/30/2012"}
{"text":"We are truly in love with the Dragon Wok. Went there for the first time last night and had the most flavorful, delicious Chinese food we have had in years.  Their flavors are unique and the food is cooked to perfection.  We had excellent service from the wait staff and will continue to go back time and time again. Thanks for a great feast!!"}
{"text":"Food was typical Chinese food. WORST SERVICE  in east valley. I mean really worst. The owner and the Server discriminates customers. They seems to choose the table they want to serve and forget the rest of the customers. If you want their food, try delivery. I will not go back there,so does all my friends who were there with me. Oh, also they charged $1.00 extra for couple of lettuce that I asked for lettuce wrap. (lettuce wrap came with only 4 little pieces of lettuce ,I needed more) No other restaurant I've been charged extra dollar for a couple of lettuce.  I don't understand why my review is not listed. average food, worst services!!"}
{"text":"Ok let me first start out and say I have been to this restaurant more than once and I have ordered takeout before and it was really great food and excellent service but tonight was a nightmare. I made a reservation for only 3 people for Christmas Day at 6:30 p.m we were quickly seated which was nice but that was it. We ordered our food with a waitress with no name tag that had black hair with a ponytail. She was really rude and short with us and the only thing she said to us was our food would take a while. Not once did she check on us or smile. She really hates her job and has a poor attitude! The food took an hour in a half to arrive and it was only ok. I will never go back that waitress one of the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"ordered takeout, waited while it was prepared, the young lady that took our order was extremely pleasant! Ordered two dishes, and one brown and one white rice...total bill just over $30.00  Took the huge paper bag home and found two VERY SMALL orders of food. The Orange chicken was very good, the other dish was tasteless! And the containers of rice were TINY. Give me a break! Very nice place inside, but the very average food does not warrant the high prices! If your gonna cut costs on food portions then make it up in rice! Will NOT return, this seems to be a place that wants to be upscale and charge upscale prices...but the food quality and portions do not warrant it!"}
{"text":"NO.  No, no, no.  I will not eat Chinese food for at least another year, thank you to this place.   Everything (chicken, lo mein, pork) tasted like fish.  Spent nearly $50 on take out and ended up throwing it out.  Save your time and money."}
{"text":"I like the place. Pretty cozy. Chinese theme even the music. Good customer service. I would go back next time."}
{"text":"Our family has ordered lots of party trays from Dragon Wok for many of our get-togethers.  After last week, however, we will never order from Dragon Wok again.    We ordered a party tray of Orange Chicken and a party tray of Crab Rangoon.  Simple, right?  NOT.  When the order was delivered at our house, the receipt had the correct order printed on it.  When we got the food inside, however, the tray of Crab Rangoon turned out to be a tray of Pot Stickers.  At the time, I thought it wasn't a huge deal, but I wanted Dragon Wok to correct their mistake.  I called immediately - within 2 minutes of it being delivered.  Here's where it gets bad.....  The woman I spoke to, Carol, insisted that I eat the Pot Stickers in place of the Crab Rangoon and they would give me a $3.00 credit (the difference in price between the two).  Although this might seem reasonable, I had many teenagers at my house who were expecting the Crab Rangoon.  I thought - it was your mistake, Dragon Wok - you should fix it.  I told Carol that we would prefer to have the Crab Rangoon delivered.    After MUCH prodding, she agreed, but then insisted that they would have to pick the Pot Stickers up and take them back.  I was confused - I had already opened the container and picked one up - surely they weren't going to sell them again!!  Carol insisted that they needed the Pot Stickers back to make sure I wasn't being dishonest.  (I should've stopped the conversation right there - did Dragon Wok just call me dishonest?!?!)  I told her that the driver could come in and see the Pot Stickers when he brought the Crab Rangoon, but they had already been contaminated.  In fact, my 5 year old niece, not knowing any better - had already eaten two!  I figured, it was their mistake, they should fix it no matter what, right?!?  WRONG!    The driver arrived with a tray of Crab Rangoon, but would not come in and see the Pot Stickers.  He got Carol on the phone and she proceeded to yell at me about returning the Pot Stickers, \"Or else.\"  I tried to calmly explain to her that the driver could see them so she would know I wasn't being dishonest, but that a few hungry kids had already eaten them.  She wasn't going to serve them to anyone else, and it was their mistake in the first place!  She yelled that she would charge my credit card for the Crab Rangoon as well.  I told her that it would be fraud if she charged my credit card without my permission.  She then yelled that she would call the police.  WHAT?  Over Pot Stickers?    Again, at this point, I should've kindly said, \"Have a good day,\" and hung up.  It was important to me to eventually end up on the same page as this woman, however, so I stayed on the phone.  She called me a \"liar,\" told me that I was \"stealing\" from Dragon Wok, and then - here's the KICKER - told me that she was going to \"lose my job over this and it will be on your conscience.\"  I said to her, \"EXCUSE me??  Why would you lose your job?  Carol - if you want me to speak to your boss to let them know it was a simple mistake, I will.  There is no need to make this into a bigger deal than it is.\"    *I was willing to speak to her boss and vouch for her!!*    After she was causing SUCH a ruckus!  She again called me a \"liar\" and then muttered, \"I can't, I can't, I can't...\" and hung up on me.  HUNG UP ON ME!    The driver didn't speak English very well, so the poor guy was really confused about what was going on.  (And rightfully so - Carol from Dragon Wok was being ridiculous.)  He took the phone back and left.  So far, I haven't noticed an additional charge on my credit card.   I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE, AND MEAN DRAGON WOK WAS!    If you ever order from them, you better hope they get your order right - because they won't fix it!  And, if they do - they might call you a liar.    GEEZ!  What happened to customer SERVICE?!?  Fixing mistakes?   I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  I've had a carry out each of the half dozen times I've eaten here, so don't  know the dining experience, but decided that it was the last time.  I usually get the Sweet and Sour chicken and fried rice.  The Sweet and Sour chicken is usually soggy and the fried rice just OK.  So, tonight I decided to ask for the sauce on the side when I placed my phone order.  When I got there, they charged me almost 2 dollars more for the privilege of having the sauce on the side.  I mentioned this to the clerk, and to the lady in charge, that it would have been nice to been told that when I ordered it.  They both said, sorry, but it's only a dollar.  I said, no it's almost 2 dollars.  She just smiled and walked away.  On top of it all, I got less food as well.  Very expensive place for what you get.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Too expensive / over priced for their food quality. Service was OK. But we will not recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews, but this place was terrible. We ordered 2 egg rolls, crab puff, small egg drop soup, cashew chicken, and shrimp broccoli? We upgraded our steamed rice for fried rice. Our bill $45.    The crab puffs and shrimp broccoli were the only edible thing we got. The chicken egg rolls were dry and no flavor to them. Egg drop soup tasted like straight water with egg floating around. Cashew chicken was in flavorless water like brown sauce and instead of having fresh vegetables in it, it had frozen peas and carrots, cashews and a few chicken pieces. It was not good at all. The fried rice was extra charge and had no egg, no carrots, or peas in it. It was so gross.   This food was extremely expensive for what you got.   I will never return."}
{"text":"This place is yet another very average Chinese restaurant here in the East Valley.  When we went the other night, we waited a bit too long to place our order.    As far as the food, I was really not impressed with either the Won Ton Soup or the eggrolls.  The eggrolls were all cabbage and barely had any pork in them.  They were also on the pricey side.  I think they were charging $10.99 for your average Beef or Chicken Lo Mein."}
{"text":"This was the worse chinese food i have ever eaten.  The fried rice is just that with the only addition is an egg and way too much soy sauce.  Nothing else in it. The chow mein is linguini,  overly oily and overcooked with little meat and we found two pieces of cabbage.  The sweet and sour chicken...blah tasting.  All but the orange chicken was bland and severely lacked salt.  The orange chicken was the only decent thing.  Way too pricey for the awful food...we ended up throwing it out and wishing we had gone to panda express instead.  At least panda express is consistently good.  We will never eat there again.  And no fortune cookie.  I hope with no one in there that the food was fresh.  Next time maybe the woman could be a little more attentive than being on her phone playing a game."}
{"text":"Took over a hour and 15 mins to have our food delivered .(2 miles away) even though they said 35mins And food was not that great, I've had better, never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Being from NYC, Chinese food has a special place in my heart. Especially when it comes to chicken and fried rice. Dragon Wok defiantly meets expectations. This place is a hole in the wall, mom n' pop kind of store. Authentic ingredients, wonderful taste and fast service! I will need to try the whole menu to give a more thorough evaluation. But from my experience, if their rice and chicken are good, the rest will follow suit."}
{"text":"There was a 2 month period where I was working from home and exclusively ate delivery from Dragon Wok.  During this time I got to try most of the menu (my favorite is lemon chicken).  I get take out from here almost once a week  The owners are very nice people and the food is amazing.  When you go in, the kitchen is visible and you will actually see Chinese people cooking the Chinese food.  The pot stickers are hands down the best I've ever had in my life.  The entree portions are big; enough for 2 people (or for two meals)  Getting take-out or delivery is quick and it's always hot.  When I've been in the restaurant sitting down, sometimes the service is slow, but I don't really care, I'm not in a rush.  I love this place and have been coming here for years (and will continue coming here) :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my food! Chicken chow mien, noodles over Cooked. And again no fortune cookies."}
{"text":"The service sucks. The lady at the counter didn't even acknowledge my existence while i was standing in front of her for 5 minutes. Then finally when she got to me, there was no \"hi, how are you\". No greeting whatsoever. She didn't say thank you once my order was complete. She was a robot. The food is ok, but not my favorite. New York Chinese is better. Probably wouldn't eat here again if it wasn't for the fact that it's right next to our house and the only place nearby for a while."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Dragon Wok. It is tucked away in a little strip mall on Ray Rd in Gilbert and is very unassuming, however once inside it is clean and comfortable with nice furnishings.   The service has always been great, the female manager/owner (I'm not sure which) recognizes us when we come in, even though for awhile it was only every few months (we lived out of state) She is very nice and sweet.  I recommend Dragon Wok for lunch over dinner - they have great specials that include an entree, crab wonton, egg roll, and rice for around $7 or $8. Dinner gets a bit pricier and everything is a la carte - the dinner prices are close to PF Chang's pricing, which seem high considering it is such a small restaurant and in a strip mall.   The food is great! Very freshly prepared, great veggies, sauces that aren't thick and sticky. I typically order the General Chicken, which is spicy but not overly so. They pass the \"egg roll test\" that I have for Chinese Restaurants: their egg rolls are delicious! Crispy with a wrapping that isn't too thick or too thin, doesn't taste like old frying oil, and the filling is a nice blend of veggies.   I do wish that they offered desserts - I always feel like something sweet at the end of the meal and have to be satisfied with just a fortune cookie :)"}
{"text":"So happy this place is literally 5 minutes away from my house! The food here is delicious and the service is great! They also deliver!! And they have lunch specials on the weekdays from 11am to 4pm! Their Mongolian beef is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My food was terrible. They are charging way too much for the quality of their food. I got the chicken Lo Mein and my chicken tasted like fish. My boyfriend had the combination lo mein and said his was terrible, too. My boyfriend's stepfather had Mongolian chicken and he said the sauce tasted like pure sugar. I was disappointed that the yelp reviews led me so astray. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I only post reviews when my service is down right deplorable, or the food in this case both. This has been the only Chinese restaurant I've ordered take out from for the past few years. It has been a few months so I gave them a call. Ordered my usual Shrimp fried rice, chicken lo mein, and fried wonton. I only wanted two items but customers have to order a 30 dollar minimum to deliver. Food comes, after delivery charge and tip it's 40 bucks. I open the shrimp fried rice and saw a long straight black hair ewww! Then the fried wonton was a crumbled mess. I called back to speak with the manager. She tells me in her Chinese accent, what wrong with the food, that's the way fried wonton is. No, I order this frequently, and I found a hair in the rice. She starts laughing then yelling. I told her you really don't give a shi- do you? She kept trying to argue, and then said she was the owner. Guess Sam is her husband. I asked if he could give me a call because she was a complete psycho. She proceeds to tell me no, said pack up yo food, driver will bring ya money and hung up. No proper English or etiquette from this lady. Driver comes back, showed him the hair and crumbled wonton. I was like would you eat this? He was like no and apologized. He was a young Caucasian and very nice. This place has gone up on the price but quality of food has not remained the same. I tasted the chicken lo mein and it was gross. This place was featured on Fox 10 news several years ago for one of the best 100 Chinese restaurants in the country. They really use that for their big sales pitch. Well I'd say it has to be one of the worst now. Don't waste your money on a place that does not care about the customer or crap food being served with hair in it..."}
{"text":"Worst scallion chicken ever! I ordered only because they deliver and it was pouring rain. Needless to say I threw this in the trash. Left our house and went right up the street in the rain to where I should've went in the first place.  Lesson learned...never again."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Dragon Wok multiple times over the past five years.    I rarely get on yelp and give her views but I feel it's my duty to alert everyone in the area that this place is gone way down the drain it saddens me. Up until about six months ago was probably the best kept secret in the East Valley.  My bill was $47 and are used to be okay with this... Today I feel like I got the short end of the stick and my stomach is starting to rumble:/  I hope that they read this and return to their glorious ways."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here. Just a little pricey, but food and service is always good!!"}
{"text":"This is the best chinese restaurant for delicious, fresh food!  They use high quality ingredients and the food is made to order.  It is not greasy or fatty which is why it is more expensive than your average chinese place.  The interior is beautiful and they have a fabulous dragon festival.  My kids beg to go to this place."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught this place on a bad night but it was some of the worst Chinese I've ever had.  I got several things and they were all bad.  I got chow fun noodle soup and the noodles were complete mush.  The Lo Mein had a faint scent of some sort of cooking fumes and the seafood was bland and overlooked.  I only tried this cause I got a menu in my mailbox and it got decent reviews.  Unfortunately, this one is going in the never again bracket."}
{"text":"This is my first ever Yelp review and I felt so inclined to post a review because I'm so disappointed in the food. We normally order from another nearby place but it's been hit or miss lately so we decided to try this place based on recommendations from others and the reviews. The food smelled awful as soon as I opened it. The taste was very bland. For $60+, It was not worth it! Will not be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Bad overpriced meal, see my video! Orange chicken and shrimp is more breading than meat, fried rice had no flavor and no veggies, egg roll had no meat and just chunks of veggies. The whole meal is small for the price and very disappointing. I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! We order take out from here almost every other weekend and each time is amazing! Their delivery always gets here faster than expected. We also dine in as often as possible and the service is great!"}
{"text":"This place must have changed ownership. The food used to be good but we ordered takeout and it was terrible. I have NEVER seen Mu Shu pork served without the pancakes and hoisin sauce, but there's was. There were hardly any vegetables in it and the pork was sliced into big medallions. The fried rice was just rice. No egg, no vegetables. We will not order again."}
{"text":"Won't order from here again.  The two stars is for the prompt delivery, but would have waited a little more for fully cooked meat. We ordered the BBQ pork app, which was okay.  The potstickers were \"meh\".  The orange chicken was really sweet and gummy bready. The Wok Beef was undercooked. The House Lo Mein was \"meh\". And the Hot & Sour soup was thick/goopy and overly peppery, and not sour at all.  VERY disappointed.  We always order enough so we can eat off it for a couple/few days.  Our dogs were the beneficiaries of our leftovers this time."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place for a few years now.. Not terribly often, but probably a dozen times over the past few years..?  First off.. I've always either gotten delivery or pickup, so I can't really speak to the dining experience there.. Though when I have picked up, it seems nice enough inside... the staff seems friendly enough as well.    Basically, I've never had a bad meal here.  I'm not a Chinese food aficionado by any means, but I've never been disappointed here as I have at other places.  I typically get the happy family, sweet and sour chicken, or some sort of lomein + some sort of appetizer.  I don't really know what to say other than I've never been disappointed.    The only negative is that its a bit spendy...  Which probably why I only go here every once in a while."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that we visit for Chinese food since finding good Chinese food is similar to looking for a needle in a haystack (especially in Arizona).  The food is always great and the owners are awesome and friendly. We usually order the Sesame Beef crispy and egg rolls. I think a few posters mentioned the high prices, but the prices are ridiculously high for dinner. We only go during lunch and happy hour when the prices are reasonable.  I highly recommend this quaint establishment. It's located on the corner of Ray Road and Cooper. If you are driving fast, then you may miss it. ( I usually drive past it haha)"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced. Their food is decent, but their customer service isn't good."}
{"text":"I've stopped twice, and wasn't thrilled either time. The food doesn't really taste any different despite the varied ingredients. My egg rolls and general tso's chicken tastes just like the fried rice. Since a better Chinese place opened right around the corner I haven't really made a point to go back"}
{"text":"Just finished dining, and before I say anything else I've got to tell you the service is so genuine and welcoming. The food was so delicious, I recommend the Egg Drop Soup. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The wifey said she had a craving for Chinese food and had been here before for lunch, so we went Saturday evening for a date night.    We were pleasantly welcomed as soon as we came in and seated at a table.  All tables were nicely decorated with faux orchids or other flowers, and there were colorful paper Chinese umbrellas and other stuff hanging from the ceiling, so the decor was fun.  There were a few specials but the menu was basically as seen online.  You have to ask if you don't know what a dish is as there are no descriptions.  As noted by other reviewers, the prices are at least a few dollars per item more than other Chinese restaurants.  However, sometimes a coupon, or their almost all-day happy hour can reduce some food and drink prices.    We first got an order of their egg rolls, which come two rolls per order.  Which is fine if two people are dining together, as the cost is twice as much as one elsewhere, but if you are dining alone, that might not be a good thing.  Anyway, the rolls came unadorned on a plate and were very good, not greasy, plenty hot, crispy, and filled with crispy veggies and other stuff.  Dipping sauce and Chinese mustard came with it for dipping.  For entrees, I ordered the Moo Shoo Chicken, and the wifey got Mongollian Beef.  The beef came out nice and hot.  I had a taste and the beef was with a sauce with mushrooms and other vegetables served atop crispy noodles.  The beef was nice and tender.  We got a big bowl of white rice for the table.  Tip to the owners: serve it with a cover, it helps keep the rice from drying out.  I got my Moo Shoo with a light brown liquid at the bottom.  Unlike some other places, it didn't seem cooked in much sauce nor was it oily at all.  I felt ambivalent about that: healthier with less sauce and oil, but could have used more flavor. The veggies with the chicken seemed mostly shredded or chopped celery...I didn't see or taste much in the way of \"Asian\" vegetables.  The chicken was in chunks and very tender.  There were the usual 4 pancakes to fill with the Moo Shoo accompanied with hoison sauce to put on them. Tip to the owners: put the pancakes in something to keep them warm and moist.  They actually did stay moist through the end of the meal, but a cover would have been nice.  The Moo Shoo dish was tasty but nothing to rave about.  The service was very good, with our waitress coming around several times to see how we were doing and refilling our waters.  All in all, it was a pleasant meal in a place with nice decor and good service with good food.  If you don't get the specials the prices seemed only a bit higher than other comparable restaurants. If you're in the area and seek some Chinese food, you might want to check it out."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a \"nice, clean, sit-down\" Chinese restaurant around where I live.  I was really hoping Dragon Wok would be \"that place\".  Unfortunately not.  The food was \"ok\"... I have had better from at least two \"take-out places\" (but they are not the type of place you go for a sit-down dinner on a Saturday night).  The \"service\" was spotty.  Our waitress came over quickly, asked us what we wanted to drink and proceeded to NEVER bring two glasses of water.  The waiter who brought over our appetizer immediately noticed we did not have any beverages at our table and asked if we asked... we told him \"yes, but our water was never delivered\".  He immediately bought over our water.  We ordered one of our \"favorites\" which we have had many times and many different Chinese restaurants..... Happy Family.  I \"noticed\" it indicated \"lobster tail\" in the description.  I thought that was odd, I have NEVER seen this dish delivered with a \"lobster tail\".... lobster \"yes\".... lobster tail.... \"no\".  I thought maybe it was just a \"typo\".  When the dish arrived, sure enough it included a \"miniscule\" lobster tail.  Think about it... you have two people, one of us had to place the \"lobster tail\" on our plate and proceed to extract the lobster from the tail... then divvy it out.  Well, it is a good thing where was only two of use, because between us, there was about a \"tablespoon\" of lobster.  Apparently they think giving you a \"tail\" allows them to not include very much lobster in the dish.  I have always had much more lobster, and not the fake stuff from anywhere I have ordered this dish.  So.... I cut this \"miniscule\" piece of lobster in two and placed it on my date's plate.  The actual dish was ok.... good at best.... nothing special.  Our appetizers (we ordered the \"sampler platter\" and  again \"ok\"..... NOTHING was at all special.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the restaurant we hoped to find.  Our search continues."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST EGGROLLS, hands down! I've ordered several things on their menu and everything is delicious. They are very friendly, even the delivery driver! No need to try anything else, this is the best place around for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We ordered pickup anf they told us it will be done in 30 minutes. Not bad. Til we got there and it wasn't even ready. Another 45 minutes. The foods was decent. The prices are too high for decent food. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering food for years from this place. Hardly any complaints. A little more pricy but it's worth it. The food is fresh and nice and hot when served. The service is good and my husband and I made it a tradition to eat there every Christmas night. My husband loves hot and sour soup so far this place makes the best one. Most of the time we get delivery. The son usually delivers and he is a very nice person."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken teriyaki and chicken was raw. :( I thought I found a Chinese food which I love, but nope."}
{"text":"Usually I patronize greasy spoon take-out Chinese places with smeared windows, but it was a real treat to find Dragon Wok.  It feels nice to go in feeling clean and come out full and still feeling clean, unlike some other establishments I've been in.  We always do lunch because I don't like paying nighttime Chinese food prices.  Seems like they double at night and then I spend way more on booze and end up $100 poorer, only to end up hungry again a half hour later.  The food at Dragon Wok is always fresh.  I feel like they may have just made those potstickers I was served from scratch.  And they make Mongolian Beef just the way I like it:  nice brown sauce, tender beef, lots of green onions, and a few fresh mushrooms.  Perfect.   The service is always friendly and fast, but not too fast.  I've never felt rushed here, unlike some other places where they drop the check with the food and say, \"No hurry, I'll be your cashier when you're ready\", which really means \"Throw your cash on the table and gtfo so I can turn this baby and get more tip.\"   I like that the owners are walking around making sure everyone is happy and they will help a server when they need to.  I hear a lot of laughter here too which means happy customers.  Always a pleasure dining at Dragon Wok."}
{"text":"A little lunch.  Very nice decor and superb Chinese food in the valley.  By far best we have had East of Phoenix.   Egg drop soup- could tell this is freshly made with chicken broth made in restaurant not jus from a box.   General chicken was sliced pieces of chicken not just frozen chunks thrown in a wok. Very tender and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service. Environment: Clean  Prices: Expensive for two people  Food: For the price I expected better and more. Steak was fatty. (I called the \"Indescribable Meat\") Very bland. Flavor in sauces. You shouldn't have to load your food with soy sauce and other sauces in order for it to be good.  Egg rolls were tough in the inside. Rating as a reminder not to come back.   Gave it a 3 because of environment and Customer Service."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place. It is located directly across the street from my house. We live in the Dobson Place subdivision and this is the closest Chinese place to our house. After reading an article in the paper about this place, we decided to give it a try. WOW, what a huge disappointment. Everywhere you look in this restaurant is a trophy or an award or some sort of proclamation about how great the food is. I am telling you the truth when I say this, the food is bland, tasteless, and just not prepared very well. The ingredients however were fresh they were just not prepared properly. Zero flavor! The beef was fatty and chewey and the chicken was tasteless. I will give a positive score to the egg rolls, they were pretty good. WonTon Soup was bland. So sad, hopefully they can get it together."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last week. Walked in and it smelt really good ad it was clean. Had good service, we received our food in a timely manner. And everything tasted really good, until a hair was found in one of the dishes. So we informed our waitress and she took the plate, it took her a couple min the come back and when she did she said we could choose something else and the manager Would take it off the bill. After that happened the service portion went down immediately. The manager never, not once came to the table to apologize, to reconcile the situation. After the waitress brought out the second dish she stayed away from the table, didn't even refill our drinks unless we caught someone walking by, and by the end of the meal she didn't even drop off our check she had someone else do it.  I'm a firm believer in good service. Even if the Meal isn't that great service has the opportunity to make up for it. And they failed on that note."}
{"text":"If I had written this review when I initially started going to Dragon Wok about 6 years ago, this might have been 4-stars. At the time, I was really happy there was a decent Chinese place for quick eats and pick-up close-by.  Over the last few years, the quality (and quantity) of the ingredients has been going downhill.  Years ago the chow mein was made with good-quality, thick noodles - which are now much thinner and (tonight) over-cooked.  I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein (which I used to love) for pick-up - when we got it back home we received a pound and a half of over-cooked noodles (I actually weighed it) along with approx. 1/4 cup of veggies comprised mainly of onions, a little carrot & some cabbage and literally 7 medium-small sized shrimp (I counted). Ridiculous noodle-to-anything-else-ratio.   I'm pretty easy-going and I don't get miffed about my food much - but this kind of presentation and lack of quality just irritates the heck out of me. Come on Dragon Wok - you're my local Chinese place and I'm in your corner!  I would gladly love you if you gave me something to love!"}
{"text":"Dragon wok has been an excellent experience for my girlfriend and I multiple times. Their food is delicious as well as quickly prepared and affordable. We will continue to come here."}
{"text":"People are nice and food is consistence. Probably the best won ton soup I have ever had."}
{"text":"This was my spot but I moved....I went here super often for almost a YEAR..got to know the super nice staff......really down to earth and they always double rinsed the wok for me because of my peanut allergies.....I miss them! GET THE CHICKEN MOO SHU"}
{"text":"Very good, not the best I ever had , but Good. Very friendly staff and so clean . The only down side its in the spendy side for us, but not crazy. We go a lot. Our absolute fav place to go is the Jade Palace in Scottsdale, the owner here said they were good friends which I like :)"}
{"text":"I've gotten take-out and delivery from Dragon Wok plenty of tiems through the years and I finally ate there last night. I was shocked when I saw all the negative reviews on here as I have always loved the food from here. The hot and sour soup is perfect with huge pieces of shrimp and just the right amount of spice and veryy flavorful. I have had numerous dishes and they are always fresh and delicious. Their Kung Pao shrimp is great. I always order everything extra spicy so they kick it up a notch for me. All of the co-workers and friends that I have recommended this place to really enjoy it. They deliver people! Just sit your fat butt on your couch and they'll bring ya some Lo Mein to put in yer gullet."}
{"text":"This was a nice family owned business near the border of chandler and Gilbert. It was busy so it was a little load but very friendly staff. We tried a variety of foods that day and everything was quite tasty. I would go back and would definitely order takeout from here when I want my Chinese food craving satisfied."}
{"text":"OVERRATED OVERRATED OVERRATED!  We eat out.  A LOT.  This Chinese food place was suppose to be a new gem we found but the result was less than lackluster.  We ordered Mongolian Beef, Orange Beef and General Chicken.    Mongolian beef was okay but they add mushrooms which is odd. The orange beef had an awful taste and smell.  Something just wasn't right. The general chicken, which one would think is more like General Cho's chicken, is not.  It's basically a sweet and sour chicken with some peppers. The fried rice was completely bland. In fact most of the items we had were bland and laced flavor. Not to mention the hefty price tag. We ordered 3 entrees and an appetizer and the meal was just shy of $60.  Forever off our list."}
{"text":"Ate inside of the restaurant, was looked at the entire time, they separated the fried won tons with their bare hands at the table next to me instead of in the back or at a sanitary prep table. Over priced, and just BLAH. Again, I'm sorry I'm white, but my money is just as good as the Chinese guy next to me right?!"}
{"text":"First time we tried food was ok. We've had better chinese at other places. Decided to give it a chance again but this time service was bad. Originally ordered 3 things and they forgot to mAke my noodles. Came back and instead of apologizing the lady was rude and blamed me. Sorry don't think I'm coming back. Panda express tastes better and service is better at alot of other places."}
{"text":"Ordered Chinese food last night. At home sick today. This placed used to have better quality food. It's been going down hill for some time now. We ordered sesame chicken, the kids said it tasted funny, and general tso's chicken, and several bites tasted like fish, and the rice was unusually spicy. Not good at all. The only item I thought tasted good was the fried egg roll, but those are not too difficult to make well. I am going to find a new place to order from now on. The only reason for two stars is they deliver pretty fast."}
{"text":"Food was very good hot ,service was good. Food took a while to come out, even though they weren't too busy. Portions a little small for the price."}
{"text":"EVERY TIME I go here it's delicious! So lite and flavorful. Not so filling like your typical chinese. Def homemade. ... Calamari, potstickers are always a hit. For entrees the generals chicken, twice cooked pork, orange beef, scallops, pineapple shrimp. It's all great. And I like that it's not ever crowded. The staff is always a delight. If I had to give one criticism, it'd be to bump up the spice level on the \"spicy\" dishes. ... Also, 5 dollars for a large saki bomber at happy hour is pretty nice"}
{"text":"We have been searching for an excellent Chinese Restaurant since moving to the Phoenix area.  Well, we found  one, Dragon Wok in Gilbert.  On our first visit, the owner stopped by our table and asked us how our food was. Everything was perfect and the service was outstanding, as the waitress continually came back to our table to check on us.  The owner stated that they prepare the food using minimal salt, which is important to us.  Great food & great service, the perfect combination."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 5 years. Always great service and food, no matter what the time of day. The egg rolls are perfectly fried. Never soggy.  I absolutely crave the honey chicken and shrimp. Portions are large enough to share if you aren't a huge eater!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but some of the best Chinese food around-- great service !!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I order very often and enjoy the high quality and great tasting dishes. Only negative I can think of is there isn't enough meat in the dishes, but it doesn't warrant giving anything less than 5 stars. Great place and great value."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my wife over the weekend.  Service was a little slow at first, and the place seemed a little dead.  There were people there eating, but the atmosphere was dull.  Once the food started arriving, however, we became happy very quickly.  The wonton soup was the best I've EVER had, which is saying a lot (my wife is Chinese).  The food overall was probably a 8.5 out of 10.  The portions were decently sized, and the menu was mostly straightforward.  There are some discprepancies with what type of fried rice comes with their two meal special, which was disappointing, and I love finding the double adjectives in the menu, like \"tasty delicious orange chicken.\"  I might be back, if only for the wonton soup.  The other appetizers are a little overpriced for what you get.  Fix that and this could be a 5 star establishment."}
{"text":"I don't understand everyone else's dislike of this place. I've ordered to-go and delivery from this establishment for two years and have never had an issue. Food is good, prices are reasonable and customer service has always been perfect.   It's family owned and operated and they are all very friendly. My family complains that there's too much sauce but I informed them that most people enjoy putting that on their plain rice and they haven't complained since. I love their chicken curry, mongolian beef, fried rice, lo mein, general chicken...basically everything. Delivery is always on time and whenever I've called in to pick up an order it is ready when I get there!"}
{"text":"SORRY FOLKS I TELL IT LIKE IT IS.... I ordered the wonton soup which was soggy in every sense of the word, the wontons were mushy as if they were soaking in the juices for days on end as well as the veggies. I also had the house fried rice, which has way too much oil in it as well as questionably dated meat. The second spoonful produced a solid piece of gristle in it - EW. But the rest was edible."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I think it is absolutely great Chinese food. The restaurant is so clean and the food is GREAT. I recently took some of my out of town relatives to eat there and they want me somehow send them food from here. I could eat there everyday. GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! For us, it is fresh and the fried rice is uh-mazing! :)  I love this place, but it's a little pricy."}
{"text":"A little pricey, good food, great service. Tucked away in a corner of a strip mall so it is easy to miss.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered two large soups (wor wonton & egg drop) and a small appetizer.  Not a good value for the $25.00 take out! Well over priced!"}
{"text":"I have to state that I'm hard on Chinese food because I've had plenty of delicious gourmet, authentic Chinese food in the bay area, LA, and China.  Let me set the stage with a couple words: No chopsticks.  This restaurant caters to non Asians, which is fine for some people but not my style.  How can a Chinese restaurant not have chopsticks in their place settings?  If you're looking for delicious and authentic, this is not the place.  If you're looking for a Panda Express equivalent in a nicer restaurant setting that serves alcohol, then this is it.  The decor is fun in a stereotypical Chinese decor way.  Service is pretty good in the sense that the waiters/waitresses are very polite and nice, but I was waiting for long periods of time multiple times during my one dining experience.  Arrived at 6:30pm, 15-20 min wait for a table, 20 min wait for food, 10 min wait for my food to be packaged up.  Ok...wait for table is normal for a busy place like this, wait for food was a little too long, wait for the packaging of my left overs was plain ridiculous.  I'm guessing they were too busy for their own good and that's why it took so long.  Why is this place so busy and why does it get so much press?  NO IDEA.  It boggles my mind.  There are better take out places and sit down restaurants in the world of Chinese food in the Phoenix/Mesa area."}
{"text":"Somewhat pricey for Chinese Food and service is less than perfect.  Food is okay. Chicken dishes are better than beef dishes as the beef has a strange texture. There are better places that cost less."}
{"text":"Great food great service. I will definitely go back again. Our food was delivered quickly and they had a good menue with different items than most Chinese restaurants. Happy hour 7 days a week with yummy appetizers."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all. I've eaten here twice and it wasn't good either time. The first time I ordered some meal with broccoli and the broccoli was so overcooked it was mush. The last time I ordered thai noodles and an order of crab rangoon. Something in the crab rangoon was spoiled so those were tossed immediately, and the pad thai noodles had absolutely no flavor whatsoever."}
{"text":"Recently I was working in the area and I needed a quick bite.  I am not from around here and didn't want to venture far.  I noticed that Dragon Wok was in the area.  I decided to stop in and was greeted or should I say ignored by one rude young lady.    I ordered General Chicken with Chow Mein and it was actually not bad.  The Chicken had what we call fillers, meaning, celery and carrots, but usually other places stop there, this had some broccoli, onions and bell peppers, this was a surprise.  I like how they added the extra stuff instead of just celery to add to the meal.  The meal came with soup and I got a kick out of how the lady walked up to me after I sat down and barked, \"Do you need soup?\" Well I don't need soup but I would like what I paid for!  I noticed she let the phone ring a few times and never picked up and one time I think she left the store and was only one there!  Anywho, the food was not that bad and in the area I think there wasn't much of a choice."}
{"text":"Decently priced food and fast delivery, but I just... wasn't crazy about the taste. There are much better Chinese places that deliver, so i would opt for Grand China or something else."}
{"text":"First time and last time.  They couldnt get the order right twice and had to go back when they failed to incluede part of the order.  They threw in a free appetizer for my troubles.  Food was average at best.  Skrimps on rice compared to every other place I've been to in town."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we have ever had. And you won't find better service. Eat there now! And eat there often!!!"}
{"text":"Rainy Sat, walked in ordered 2 orders of pork chop suey and sweet & sour chicken, they were busy,  girl at counter took 2-3  phone orders. While I stood there thru all calls,  I always thought the customer standing in front of you came first, not here,  she took calls while i was standing there 3-5 min. Finally took my order and I sat & waited for 25 MIN. My daughter was in the car with a 2 month old she timed it! . Another guy came in he ordered and got his food  quick!?.After all that waiting,  food was horrible,  where's the meat?  Where's the flavor,  all missing!  Had no idea you could mess up Chinese food.  So if you like your food with bits of meat Or a vegetarian and flavor just waved over your food.  Go here. Oh btw call in your order."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Chinese place in the valley. My 5 year old even asked to go there for her birthday! We went for Christmas dinner this year and have been back a few times since then. It's kinda far from our house otherwise we would be there more often! Service is quick, food is great and reminds me of going out for Chinese food with my mom when I was little. ... oh and you can ask for chopsticks but forks are provided. I am sure it is not very authentic but it is what I would expect from American Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time for carry out. The wor won ton soup was bland, the stock was not rich. We got the garlic chicken. That was pretty good, nice and spicy. The rice portion was very small. We finished the rice and there was a lot of chicken and veggies left. The place I usually get carry out from gives you twice as much."}
{"text":"Dragon Wok is a great lunch spot.  All meals are under $10 and are plentiful and delicious.  The selection of dishes is pretty staggering and owner Sam is happy to suggest or modify anything to your liking or taste.  This is one of the better Chinese places in the Phoenix Metro area for sure."}
{"text":"We love coming to dragon wok when we have cheat days. Sometimes we do delivery and they are always so quick and everything is always fresh!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this place recently. We had gone there several times years ago and were disappointed, but thought enough time had gone by for them to improve things. We were wrong. There was only one other group of three people in the restaurant, but it took at least 20-30 minutes before we even got a menu or were even acknowledged. The servers would glance at us occasionally, but not even speak. The food we ordered (orange chicken and tofu vegetables) was mediocre, and the \"fried rice\" was in our opinion not good at all. We both ordered hot tea and got about 1 1/2 cups of hot water with one tea bag between us. We won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Prompt, courteous delivery!  Each item was nicely packaged and sealed, no spills or greasy paper bag bottoms.  The Salt & Pepper Calamari was just as good as when I had it at the restaurant - light, buttery, and a spicy bite! We also enjoyed the Potstickers, Honey Shrimp & Chicken, Sweet & Sour Pork, and Teriyaki Chicken.  Personally, I love the Pung Wok Three \"extra spicy\" (it's AWESOME) but this time I was sharing with my mom who likes sweet, fried dishes and my son who is 4 and super picky.  The verdict?  My son ate the Teriyaki Chicken with no complaints and I inspected the meat before serving to make sure there was no cartilage or fat - all good.  He also ate several pieces of the Chinese Chicken Fingers (actually the Calamari - shhh!) before he noticed the spicy peppers.  As for Mom, her comment was \"It's good and at least it's not greasy!  You wouldn't believe the greasy Chinese food my sister served us last week - and she said it was the best!  I had indigestion all night.... blah, blah, blah.\"  It may not sound like much, but that is high praise from a woman who believes every compliment should be followed by \"constructive\" criticism.  The prices here are a little higher than your typical Chinese take-out, and I wish the potstickers were fried on all sides instead of just one.  BUT, now that Dragon Wok has Mom's approval, there's no way I'm getting delivery elsewhere!  It's totally worth a couple more dollars and a semi-limp potsticker to make Mom happy, right? :)"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast but we had to order $28 in food to make it happen .  It didn't take long to get to $28 since their prices are so high .  $12 - $15 per item seems steep for less than average Chinese food.  I'd have been better off going to Frys and buying 1 of everything in the frozen Chinese food section and cooking it myself.  Where's PF Chang's at around here when you need one?  I'd even settle for the 1.50 an item joint back home over this swill"}
{"text":"We loved the Chinese New Year celebration! Make reservations for next year, it was fun. Love the food, we have been enjoying dinners here for over 4 years, good service and resonable prices. The kitchen will \"kick up\" any dish to your liking,add extra shrimp to the Phoenix and spice it a bit and WOW,it's the best!!   Love Sam and the pleasant staff,       Ree & Bob"}
{"text":"I live 5 mins away from this place and came here several times. I always end up getting their specials dinner that includes choice of 2 entrees ; choice of soup; egg roll and I believe fried rice and it's like $24.99. I like their food and I think their price is reasonable. I esp love their Mongolian beef."}
{"text":"Finding decent Chinese food in Arizona that won't  give you  food poisoning is hard. So I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend and i found Dragon Wok. We have been here twice and both times the food was great. The meat is tender and flavorful. The service and ambiance is wonderful. Overall great place to enjoy a quiet dinner. We will definitely be back to our favorite little Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"I really dont understand what could be so difficult about substituting rice for chow mein. Im not going to eat the rice so I dont want it. But Im not going to pay $12 for orange chicken and an additional $10 for f%#ing noodles.....willing to pay extra...just not double. Its sad because I was told their food is great. Unfortunately business/common sense is lacking. Next time dont lose a customer over a simple substitution."}
{"text":"Just called to order 5 items and expected to pay $55-$60 total with tax. They told me my order cost $78 and that the Yelp menu is not their prices and redirected me to their website. They said that they do not advertise with Yelp and that I shouldn't trust everything I read...what?!?! Lol, I was disappointed that they were rude. I obviously canceled the order and went elsewhere. How do I notify Yelp?"}
{"text":"I've never been to the resturant but from a delievery stand point..They get the food out QUICKLY. They will tell you it'll take 40 minutes but five to ten minutes later the food is at your door and it's hot off the oven fresh.  Over the years- I've tried almost everything on their menu and they can do no wrong. The food is great! They have the best crab rangoon and I love their Pineapple chicken."}
{"text":"A few months ago I had written a review for this place. I had mentioned it was \"irrelevant and forgettable\" well, it seems i have remembered to try this place one more time.  It was a last minute dinner option, as I was too tired to cook, or do anything for that matter, so I decided to give this place another try. All I was craving was beef and broccoli, chow mein, and egg drop soup. Here's how it went:  Beef and broccoli: broccoli had a nice bite, not too soggy, not too crunchy. Beef had nice taste and not as chewy as last time. Sauce was tasty, but overall the dish was a bit bland as it could've used a pinch or ten of salt.  Chicken chow mein: noodles were a bit over cooked and almost turned to mush once I began to chew. I was a bit confused with the noodles as I noticed it was a mix of fettuccine noodles and chow mein noodles. The chicken pieces were not as prevalent in this dish, but still had a good taste. The overall flavor was good, but again missed the mark when it came down to seasoning as it was a bit too bland.  Egg drop soup: soup was nice and hot as it should be. It had an even egg:soup ratio, as opposed to others that I've had either had too much egg or not enough. This was perfect. This is probably the only dish that was on point with the seasoning. The soup was delicious.   All in all, I would score this restaurant a 3.5 this time. Although the dishes lacked flavor, I had no real issue with this as I saw it as something a little soy sauce couldn't fix. The shining star was definitely the egg drop soup followed by the beef and broccoli. Higher points could've been scored had it not been for the over cooked noodles and lack of seasoning. I was quite surprised with the delivery time as well, as it took less than 20 minutes to arrive. I might order again from Dragon Wok in hopes that these inconsistencies are fixed in the future."}
{"text":"The Chinese food here is the best in town.  Like Lynn said, it is a huge step up from Panda Express and better value then PF Chang.  My manager highly recommended this place to me many years ago and he is very particular about his foods.  When I finally get time to try it out, I strongly agree with him.    The food is make fresh to order with the freshest ingredients.  The serves are exceptional.  And the place is really clean.  Try it for yourself and see what I discovered for myself.  BTW. they been celebriting Chinese New Year with a traditional lion dance the last 3 years.  If you don't want to face parking problem at the Chinese Culture center (CCC),  you can see this performance here every year.  The performing team is very good better than the CCC.  Call to make sure about the date and time.  Your kids will loves this entertainment."}
{"text":"Just got some soup from this disgusting place... found a few hairs in it... awful. Never going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good water. Doubt they actually use a wok for every dish; talk about false advertising. China makes good food and good american flags. Ain't no panda express tho"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is grate service They fill you up with good food I recommend this place to anyone  We will come back again thank you.........."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery because this was the closet Chinese place near where I live. Ordered 100 dollars worth of food. But all the Food i got l was bland. Now that China a go go is near as well I will go there for now on. They have great food and most of the time they give me free extras such as free egg roll. If you are wondering if you would like to try this Chinese place. Say no and drive a min further to China a go go."}
{"text":"So far, this has been the best chinese restaurant I've eaten at in Vegas.  Luckily, we live walking distance from this place, we order from here for take-out often.  The prices are outstanding, and the sizes are very generous."}
{"text":"Ordered sweet and sour chicken to carry out and asked if the sauce could be put on the side, was told yes. When picking up the order was charged and extra $1.50 for putting the sauce on the side. When asked why they hadn't said anything before she said \"it's only a dollar!\" Actually it's $1.50 plus tax.  Wish I had just left the food there and walked out.  Customer service is not present at this restaurant and $14 for one order of just ok sweet and sour chicken is way too much.  I will not return and would not recommend Dragon Wok to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered the General chicken.  Chicken came out room temp and pieces were chewey. When the waitress came around, I let her know and she walked over to someone in the kitchen that I believe was the manager or owner, they spoke in Chinese so have no idea what was said.  The waitress had left cause her shift must have ended.  Next thing I know, the manager was dropping off the bill.  I shared with her my concern as well, she just told me that their general chicken are small piences of checken breaded and that is the way they make it.  Last I checked even decent chicken cooked properly is NOT chewy!  She didnt offer to do anything to make it right.... won't me back.... not happy!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly! The resturaunt itself seemed nice and clean and a good place to have a sit down dinner at.  I ordered the pineapple shrimp with some extra veggies as take out.  Not many veggies were in the dish, but I find that to be typical from Chinese food take out places.  They gave me chicken instead of shrimp in my order.  Sad panda.  Still, it was good.  Not quite as crispy as I like, but still yummy. The veggies were great as was the sauce, so I'm sorry there were not more veggies.   The pineapple was not that sweet.  Tasty, just not what I've had at other places.  This is actually my first Chinese food in Arizona.  We shall see how it measures up to further chinese take out ventures.  I'd order from them again, but I have nothing to compare it to out here."}
{"text":"Food is fine, but when I asked for my sweet and sour sauce on the side I was charged extra. Extra for delivery charge. This on top of their already high prices.   Sweet and sour chicken, pork fried rice, and potstickers delivered for $41!   I should have ordered steaks to be delivered for that money....  I'll never order here again."}
{"text":"Wok done right, nice and crispy without being over cooked, vegetables still have a snap. Great food, love the generals chicken and shrimp! Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"Came in because I was in this side of town for the day and was in the mood for cheap Chinese. Came around 2 pm in time for the lunch specials... Ordered general chicken and my goodness was I disappointed. The chicken was mainly breading and it tasted watered down. Odd. I've had multiple cheap Chinese in the valley and at least it all had taste to it. Wasn't even sweet or anything. I'll go back but will try out something else to hopefully sway my criticism for this place. Until then... 2*."}
{"text":"If you blink on your way past Ray and Cooper, you could miss it, but you'd be missing one of the best Chinese food places in Phoenix. Very rarely do you find such great Chinese food at affordable prices too.  Dragon Wok rivals(even bests) the pricy, big names like PF whatchamacallit and others. My favorite dish, walnut shrimp has me floored absolutely every time I eat it. All the classic dishes are available and totally exceed expectations.   I highly recommend making a drive even if you are far. I live like 15 miles away, but it's always with the trip."}
{"text":"I ordered there for the first time today. The food got here in record time. I ordered Singapore noodles they had the biggest shrimp I've ever seen in these noodles.  The food was very flavorful. My husband loved the shrimp fried rice. Good choice I thought all was lost out here in Kannapolis, NC. I have a favorite Chinese restaurant that delivers. Woo hoo"}
{"text":"As far as American-Chinese food goes, the food is very good at Dragon Wok and always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Attempted to order for the first time for delivery, it says on the website there is no minimum amount for delivery.  I live only 4 miles away, but I am busy with school, so delivery was convenient for me.  I called and the manager said there is a minimum of $30 for delivery and that they think 4 miles is far for delivering.  Her customer service skills were horrible as well.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Today was the first (and most likely the last) time I've eaten here.     The first thing I noticed was the prices of the items on the lunch menu.  To me, they seemed to be a little on the high side.  Then I noticed that the meals didn't even come with soup...that was another $1.50.  Anyway, I was there, I was hungry, so I ordered an iced tea, the Kung Pao Shrimp and Chicken (extra spicy) and added a cup of wonton soup.     So, I'm sitting there...and sitting there and sitting there...thinking, \"Geez, it's taking a long time to get my cup of soup.  Maybe they're bringing it with the meal.\"  Finally, the soup came out.  I looked at it and thought, \"What the...?\"  I'm sorry, but when I order wonton soup, I want wonton soup.  This one had the wontons in it, but it also had strips of pork, a mushroom, a piece of broccoli, a snow pea pod, etc.  While I normally like each of the added foods, I don't want that stuff in my wonton soup.  It didn't taste like the wonton soup I was expecting.  So, I finished that and waited some more for my entree.  When it finally came, I was shocked at how small the portion was...especially for the price they charged.  Here's the reason I am giving them 2 stars instead of just one: the kung pao, egg roll, crab cheese wonton, and rice were really good.  Just wished it was a larger serving for the price.     As for the service, all I can say is, \"Meh.\"  They got the job done, but I felt the girl serving me didn't care.  When she sat me, instead of asking what I wanted to drink, she just left to continue what she was doing when I walked in.  After 7 minutes, she came back and took my drink and food order.  I will say that she and the other woman working there (I'm just guessing it was the owner or manager) did keep my tea filled, but no one ever came back to check and see if everything was ok after I had gotten the food.  They would walk up, fill my glass with tea, and then walk off.     So, even though the food tasted pretty good, I doubt I'll be back.  There's another Chinese restaurant down the street that's just as close to me as this one, and their meals are larger, their prices are cheaper, their service is better, and their food tastes just as good to me."}
{"text":"You KNOW a restaurant is great when you go somewhere else and think, \"Gee, so-and-so's food is soo much better than this...\" Dragon Wok IS that restaurant, the one you compare all others to... the one that tingles your tastes buds and leaves you wanting more.  This restaurant is a family favorite of ours. I can't tell you what to order... All I can tell you is that everything I've tasted here was delicious. Some dishes I'm in love with: Orange Chicken, Combination Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Gourmet Beef and their War Wonton Soup (yum!).  Dragon Wok is a wonderful establishment: The food comes in family-size portions, it always tastes great (they'll even customize a dish for you!), the decor is nice and unique, and-most importantly-everything is CLEAN (the floor, the tables, the kitchen, and even the bathrooms).  If you're wondering whether you should give them a try, the answer is \"YES!\" Dragon Wok provides wonderful meals, service and an environment that makes every dining experience enjoyable =]"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood Chinese place, we order delivery every month-ish. The service is friendly and very fast, but I wouldn't eat inside, it's cramped and the tables aren't cleaned often.   I love their honey walnut shrimp, and we usually get an order of general's chicken and the crab rangoons. The orange chicken is also good, but not as good as the general's chicken. Won ton soup was also really good but I only get it when I'm in the mood.   I wish I would have known they do half orders of most entrees. The full size is huge!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My family has been coming here for the past 10+ years. My hubby and I love the General Chicken and my brothers love the Orange Chicken. My parents love the Beef W/Broccoli. Their crab puffs are SO. GOOD. They're my favorite crab puffs ever although they are a bit pricy. I think it's around $7 for 4 of them. Their soups are also yummy.  Things I would pass on: the Dragon Rolls and the Lo Mein. They're nothing to rave about!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! The food was fresh and tasty and the staff was friendly! After many terrible experiences at other Chinese food places around Gilbert, I think we found a great place to eat! I recommend the beef lomein!!!"}
{"text":"Last night we ordered food for pick up. It was very busy that evening. But when I stood near the front podium where they seat people and the counter you pick up orders from I was ignored for ten minutes. After saying to manager that I'm just picking order up she walked away. and then when she  came back just didn't acknowledge me. The bartender I'm assuming who seemed to be in charge of bar and pick up counter also ignored me the whole time until i yelled excuse me I just need to pick. Up order I called in he turned looked at tickets and grabbed what he thought was my order handed it too me witch by the way the bag was sealed and sitting on counter the whole time I waited. I get home and the order was wrong. General chicken shouldn't have shrimp in it. So I brought it back. The manager whining noted me earlier goes thru the good and tells me it's correct order !!! No I feel like a dummy so I leave the testurant to bring food home. The same food I got the first time, we finally open the top of container it was see threw and yup that's shrimp and honey chicken. Not what we ordered so we call the restaurant they want to bring us the right order but by this time an hour has passed foods cold my wife whom is pregnant and about to have baby any day is starving as am I. So we told them we wanted refund witch they did give us. But what a hassle. Hence I will never go back to dragon wok again. Ohh and the sweet and sour chicken was right but they cover the chicken in the sauce instead of serving the sauce on the side with crunchy chicken you get soggy sauce drenched chicken. The part that pissed me off the most was while I was being ignored another waiter was asking where to bring drinks to and that bartender looked right at me eye contact and said no not him around the corner behind me. At that point I finally yelled for his attention!!!!'   Don't waist time or money here !!!!' Hot wok is better and cheaper and right down the street....."}
{"text":"One word: AUTHENTIC.   This is the kind of restaurant with a Chinese grandma cooking up a storm in the kitchen in the back. Portions are huge, prices are reasonable, and the taste is on point. It's not Americanized Chinese food so flavors are tailored for Asian tongues. Don't eat inside, order for take-out."}
{"text":"Pros: I placed an order for pick up and it was ready in under 15 minutes. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the lemon chicken with some steamed rice and fried rice. The whole family ate their fill and we were very satisfied.   Cons: At $28 it seemed a bit expensive for two entrees. The chicken could have been a little crispier. They forgot my side of sweet and sour sauce.   I am sure we will order again in the future."}
{"text":"So my family and I went to this restaurant tonight due to an article that was written in our local paper about it. Raved as one of the top 100 chinese restaurants in the nation.  I am not sure what nation they are talking about but I get better food at my neighborhood PF Chang's.  Atmosphere is nice but the kitchen is too open, you can hear all the noise.  They play constant whistle/flute music, which would be calming, however they play it at too loud of volume so it comes across as more annoying than calming.  The soda machine is right by the tables so they were filling the ice while we were eating and it was very loud.  We were seated right away but then proceeded to wait about 10 mins before being approached by anyone.  Not only were we ready with our drink order by the time the server arrived, we had read the menu and decided on our food as well.  The food took quite a while to come out of the kitchen despite only having a few diners there.  The appetizer of lettuce wraps was boring and non flavorful, served with only 4, non appetizing almost all white iceberg lettuce leaves, the non green part I usually throw out and the price of $9.99 was ridiculous.  We ordered 3 entrees, all tasted the same, which was like nothing.  I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.    I will say a couple of good points were the beef, chicken and seafood they used were of good quality.  The scallops were very large, beef tender with no fat or toughness and the chicken was the same.  However it was hard to enjoy due to none of it having any flavor.  I was hoping the reviews I read about the food being bland on the way to the restaurant were wrong but they were right on point.  Dinner was about $65.00 with tip for 3 of us, that was only 3 entrees and 1 sad appetizer...I paid less taking my daughter and a friend to BJ's, got a ton more food and it was much more delicious.  One last note, tables are too close together.  I enjoy a dining experience without having people right next to me, which is how some of the tables are here.  One long bench against one wall but with tables and chairs lined up.  I will take a private booth any day!  This is the first review I have ever written for a restaurant so for me to take the time, you know I am speaking the truth!  Save your money people, I will be spending mine somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is actually a 3.5 Price wise, this is some expensive Chinese delivery. $40 for 2 people before tip is a lot. Our order break down: Eggrolls: really good, they use chicken, which is uncommon (most places use pork or just veggies) Fried wantons: I liked them, my wife did not like the pork, she thought it was too tough and prefers unseasoned meat (she's a very picky eater) Wanton soup: I asked for it with just the wantons and green onions. I liked it, the broth was delicious, and the wantons had good flavour. My only complaint is they use very little meat in these. I'm used to wantons where the meat area is a little ball (and looks like a little brain, lol), this is like a quarter of the meat I'm used to. Egg drop soup: initial flavour was good, but has a strange sort of chemically after taste I can't identify. Lemon chicken: really delicious, meat was tender, flavour was excellent, really the best part of our order. We both loved it Fried rice: my wife really like it, primarily because there was nothing in it but rice. No veggies, no bits of pork or chicken, nothing. For a picky eater like her, she thought it was awesome.  So far this is our best Chinese delivery since we moved to this area. Hopefully we'll find some coupons so it's not always so expensive."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the sweet and sour pork excellent.The prices are a little high but worth the money."}
{"text":"Very delicious, authentic Chinese food. Their skills taste like they're fresh off the boat, and the food is fresher! Go here and order something new you add to your repertoire, or order your \"usual\" to discover the amazing difference in quality they offer."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service over the phone, asked questions on prices and substitutions for the dinner deluxe for two. They allow for substitutions but will charge the difference for price but won't give back money if you sub out for something cheaper. Employee was rude and condescending and hung up on me for asking questions."}
{"text":"Never got my free crab puffs and staff was extremely rude when I asked to modify my order. Very overpriced for Small Portions of Average Food. At least the food should of been half decent If I can't modify my order. DEFINITELY OVERPRICED FOR THEIR QUALITY"}
{"text":"Awesome food and happy hour drink specials 7 days a week! Great atmosphere and service. Especially loved the Lemon Chicken and Egg Foo Young. We'll be back! Great find tucked into the corner of a strip mall."}
{"text":"Today was the last time I come here ever again!  If I order takeout and you tell me 20 minutes and when I get there YOU then start to cook my food!  I am super upset because that totally defeats the purpose for me ordering take out! it has now been 40 minutes since I ordered my food.  Time is money don't waste my time.  Also, for the reviews below saying this is the best chinese food they ever had.  Well, you need to go outside your box (THERE ARE WAY BETTER PLACES) because the only thing good about this place is the price (during lunch hours)."}
{"text":"Dragon Wok is one of those places I stumbled upon by accident. I drove from Henderson toward  Lone Mountain to go hiking. On the way to the hike, I decided to stop at the Cliff Shadows at the 215 Chevron convenience store for water. Owing to the fact that the parking lot was filled up, I drove to the back of  Chevron then  into the parking lot for a small shopping center. In this small shopping center, I spotted Dragon Wok.     I was debated on delaying the hike and trying one of their lunch special. My original intention was to return to Chicago Brew Pub after the hike. Dragon Wok wasn't exactly breaking the Yelp ratings record. The ratings were low. Regardless I was in the mood for pepper steak. Mother Nature would make the decision for me when it started to downpour in the northwest valley. Now I had decided on giving Dragon Wok a try.      When I made my way inside, it was a few minutes after it opened around 11 A.M. The only people that were inside the small take-out style restaurant were the two that worked there. I exchanged around $8 and change for the pepper steak lunch combination that included egg drop soup and fried rice plus a fountain Coke.      The diminutive restaurant featured only a few tables with little to look at. However, it did have a prime view of the kitchen. From this prime view, the customers have the advantage of watching the Chef make their Chinese food.     As far as my food went, the Chef did a fantastic job. The pepper steak and onions were delicious. The Chef made the pepper steak and onions the way I like it.  The pepper steak was soft, flavorful, and juicy. This pepper steak was the antithesis of the rubbery stuff that some Chinese restaurants pass off as pepper steak. The sauce and onions were equally flavorful. The fried rice was outstanding. Additionally the bowl of egg drop soup was good.     The service was satisfactory. Because I was the sole customer in the restaurant it is difficult to tell how the service is when it is busy. The man who took my order then served the food, which is in a styrofoam plate by the way, did ask how my food was. The one drawback in service was that after the man brought the pepper steak lunch to my table, I had to ask him for the egg drop soup that is included.      My Dragon Wok dining experience was one of those times that I was glad to have a down pour lead me inside. Mother Nature created a down pour  that led me to a Chinese take out restaurant that served me one of the better pepper steak lunches and fried rice that I have had in a while."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude and inattentive. I wasn't able to catch her name but she was in her early twenties. Was playing on her cell the whole time we were talking and when a delivery man came in she rudely interrupted my conversation with her to talk to him"}
{"text":"Five of us arrived and were greeted promptly seated at the round table. Service throughout the meal was very good. Food and drinks arrived without delay and our waitress was very attentive to ours needs.  The food was just ok, however, which is why I give them 3 stars. We had Tristar Mongolian, Cashew Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, Mixed Veggies, Egg and Spring Rolls.  Everything had the same texture: tender, but no crispiness or depth. I also found that each dish had too much sauce and didn't leave the meats or veggies to speak for themselves."}
{"text":"My husbands family loves this place! The dumplings are fabulous and my husband loves the crab puffs with spicy mustard. The ingredients seem fresh and they have great lunch specials! I must on anyone's list in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the valley 11 years ago, I'm still yet to find a better Chinese restaurant than Dragon Wok. The mongolian beef is the amazingly tender and perfectly seasoned. Even my 85 year old father orders it and he usually bitches because he can't chew steak with his false teeth. I also highly recommend the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer...best I ever had."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from someone I know and thought I'd give it a try.  Hands down, the best Chinese food I've ever had.  I've been around the country and tried many different Chinese food places and this is by far the best tasting and best quality I've ever had.  For starters, had the Spring Rolls which are shrimp and vegetables.  Super amazing shell.  Ate two.  Also had Crab Puffs.  Usually, you get mostly fried wonton with half a teaspoon of cream cheese and a flake of crab.  These were awesome!  The batter was so puffy and delicious, each one was at least big enough for four bites.  The filling was at least two or three tablespoons worth and you can see and taste the crab meat.  So good.  My daughter and her friend had the Orange Chicken with fried rice.  The chicken was all white meat, very tender and juicy, the breading was like the crab puffs, very fluffy, awesome sauce.  The fried rice was super flavorful.  I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp.  It was pretty good, different style than what I was expecting.  Typically there's a little breading on the shrimp, this wasn't breaded at all.  Not disappointed.  So good.  Lots of large peanuts, the proportion of veggies and shrimp was perfect.  Most places will give you six large shrimp and phone it in.  This had at least 10 large shrimp.  I almost wasn't able to eat all of them.  The service was outstanding.  We arrived at 6, thinking there would be a dinner rush.  Our server was super friendly and attentive to our needs with refilling drinks and checking on us frequently.  One of the cooks came over and asked how everything was too.  This is a family owned and run place and you can totally tell.  I will be coming back again and bringing friends for my next visit."}
{"text":"Great value and good service.  It isn't ground breaking but its good for quick and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Dragon Wok is a really nice place for lunch. After talking with the waitress for a few minutes about the menu, she made a suggestion for a dish not included on the menu - she pumped up the spices and cut down on the fat - fabulous, simply fabulous. I always enjoy restaurants that will work with you to create something truly enjoyable. I'm sure we wouldn't have received this level of service if the place had been slammed at the time - but it was definitely one of the best lunches we've had out in a long while."}
{"text":"Dragon Wok is a huge step up from Panda Express, and a better value than P.F. Chang's. Good quality food at a fair price, friendly service, and a full bar.  We special order the Moo Goo Gai Pan (substitute Kung Pao sauce) and it's one of the tastiest dishes ever. Generous servings, good quality meat and veggies, and brown rice is an option for a nominal charge.  Atmosphere is nice for lunch, nothing fancy, but fine. Their delivery service is fast, and the food arrives hot and as ordered.  And we agree with Adam W. It won't break the bank, and you won't pay for it in other ways either..."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese food ever and even better because they delivered with minimum purchase of $15. We usually get a few things that round up to $25, but it's worth every penny. Delicious and affordable! Would definitely recommend to anyone around the area that wants delivered Chinese food right at your front door.  If I can give it a 10 stars, I would"}
{"text":"Disgustingly filthy. Tables sticky, chairs worse. Plastic utensils, Styrofoam plates, no napkins. Served in to-go containers. Nearly empty filthy sticky soy sauce bottle. Want tea? Sorry, none, despite what's on the menu. Boxes piled in the dining area. Just keep driving...away...fast!"}
{"text":"I'm all for your standard Americanized Chinese food but I was disappointed in Dragon Wok.  First off I was bummed that the menu didn't offer a dinner combination for just one person (at Ho Ho Ho Chinese it's $10 for the entree, fried rice/lo mein, soup, and one each of an egg roll, fried shrimp and cream cheese wonton). I also wish they had sesame tofu as I was really craving that tonight.  I ordered delivery and it arrived when I expected it to, but the food was lukewarm - nowhere near to being hot. Also, with the sweet and sour chicken there were only 2 pieces of pineapple, 2 pieces of green pepper, 3 slices of carrots and about 5 slices of onion for the entire dish - I mean, I guess it's good there was a lot of chicken, but the variety of veggies is part of why I like this dish so much. Then, I was sad to find out that my fortune cookie was stale :(.  I'll probably give it one more try since it's the closest Chinese place and I'm sure my fiance (who's out of town this week) will want to give it a shot, but I don't have high hopes for my repeat experience."}
{"text":"This place is great tasting and beautiful inside! Great service every time. I get the combination lo mein each time I go and it's wonderful and full of flavor! It's huge and you get alot of noodles, which I like. This is a complete gem found in a strip mall that can be easily overlooked. Please check this place out! Such a great idea when your not in the mood to get all dressed up, but want the ambiance of a nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, they have the best chicken that is used in their menu,! We drive all the way across town just to get their food. And the family run business is always out making sure you are happy with your meal."}
{"text":"I haven't found a dish here that isn't good. Plus the chile sauce on the table is ridiculously spicy, but I put it on everything."}
{"text":"The restaurant ambiance and layout were lovely. One of the cleanest, most well-decorated Chinese restaurants I've been to. I arrived about an hour and a half before close, and after the two tables left I had the restaurant to myself. I ordered Wonton soup (a staple of mine), and asked that it be made with no shrimp. I followed my order with Orange Chicken extra spicy and fried rice. My waitress was accommodating with both my requests  and pleasant.  The wonton soup was not what I was expecting (see picture). The broth was tasty, but for the high price (I think $5.99 for a small), I would not order again. The orange chicken was good! Fresh, hot, and enough for left overs - which I usually expect with Chinese.   So overall I enjoyed my experience. I docked one star because as I was finishing, I was overwhelmed with the smell of bleach because a gentleman was mopping as much as he could without getting too close. I understand starting sidework early, but the overpowering smell wasn't a great ending!"}
{"text":"This is not one of those bad reviews because of one silly little thing that no one should be judging a restaurant so harshly on. I can honestly say it was the worst Chinese food I can ever remember having.  I tried this for lunch this week, and I thought I might have just ordered a bad dish, but my coworker got something different and did not even eat his, it was so awful.  I ordered the General Chicken, and all I could eat out of it was the (very few) vegetables. The chicken was some sort of combination of soggy and chewy, which I'm not even sure how they accomplished. Maybe it was sitting in the (flavorless) sauce for a couple days after they cooked it and they just reheated it? That's my best guess. The outside was soggy and gross and the inside was tough and chewy, I could barely even bite through it.  The fried rice appeared to be regular white rice that may have been rolled around in some grease for a moment. It had no flavor and nothing else added into it. I'll skip over the egg roll because those are never much to talk about. The crab puff was the most edible part of the whole meal, and I don't even care for crab puffs.   I usually like to give places a second chance. I will not be trying this EVER again. As a side note, they also forgot something we asked for (we got delivery) but I try not to judge on mistakes if the food is good...there was nothing good here."}
{"text":"Food was great.  I especially liked the Mongolian Beef.   They offered lunch specials on the weekend - a rarity!  Excellent service and very pleasing ambiance.   My husband enjoyed the tsing tao beer.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is pretry good. This is my go to place to eat Chinese food since I live around the corner and the Thai Tea with Boba is quite delicious and they deliver to. My girl likes the soup"}
{"text":"Everyone knows that Chinese food in Az leaves much to be desired especially if you are from NY. But I have to say Dragon Wok is the best so far that we have tried in the last 18 years. The food is fresh. I really like the orange chicken. The fried rice that comes with the dinners leave much to be desired & maybe they can add some desserts to the menu."}
{"text":"Dragon Wok came highly recommended so I decided to check it out for myself!   The restaurant was very clean inside and outside, the staff spoke good English and were very polite!  We ordered a few dishes for the family by phone; our menu consisted of chicken lo mein, egg foo young, chicken and broccoli, and egg rolls!   When we arrived 15 later the food was ready and being placed in a bag for us, accompanied by several different sauces, chopsticks and fortune cookies!   Once we got the bag home the family dived in, and I must say, they did not disappoint!   The food was hot and fresh, the egg rolls were a crispy crunchy treat of Asian goodness and and the egg foo young was delicious!  I enjoyed every bite and I will definitely order from Dragon Wok again!  Update:  I decided to go back for more of the amazing food I delighted in a few days ago and I have to say some of the items were not that good! The shrimp egg foo young was delicious but the little mein was a disappointment this time, it was a little greasy and not as flavorful as the previous order (maybe it was a different cook)!    Maybe I'll stick to the egg foo young!"}
{"text":"It's a dark day... When this is the best Chinese restaurant in the area, simply because the chicken taste like actual chicken and not some \"mystery\" meat.  Don't act like you don't know what I am getting at either.    The food... Is not seasoned all that wonderfully. Come here for a no frills dining experience at its most expensive!  You do not get free fortune cookies or chopsticks with your food either.  They have barely closed the gravy so it will spill all over your lap too.    Atmosphere:  This place has a mid level sanitation rating, I think a 94, and visible water, brown stains in the ceiling.  A lighted sign where the lights are blown, and no one has bothered to replace them.  There is silver duct tape conspicuously covering certain defunct menu items.  The staff: A step up from \"cold,\" The staff is just short of rude...  No one goes out of their way to be especially friendly, helpful or nice.    The bottom line is, it's slim pickings from decent Chinese eats.   The two stars are relative.  The \"best\" one is only the best because they actually provide real chicken, under seasoned food, mechanical dispositions and gummy noodles!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, nice staff.  This is one of our favorite lunch places.  We love going to Dragon Wok for lunch after church on Sunday's.  The restaurant can get pretty busy at dinner time, but during lunch, we are always able to get seated right away.  The hostess recognizes us as soon as we walk in the door and always asks us where our son is if we don't bring him with us.  It's the best feeling to be remembered!  The lunch menu is really well priced (about $7 - $9 per entree) and each entree comes with fried rice, an egg roll and crab puffs.  It's the perfect amount of food for me.  The staff is pretty good about keeping drinks full; I fell like this wasn't always the case, but in recent visits it has been perfect.  There is no dessert menu at Dragon Wok (maybe we'll get one someday), but fortune cookies are always delivered with the check."}
{"text":"I took my three year old daughter here and we had a great lunch! Beef lo mein was excellent lunch combo choice. Big portions...you will not leave hungry. What I love about this place is the chili paste on the table. It's a perfect spicy condiment for a Chinese meal.   Friendly service and nice decor. Too bad it's in an old albertsons shopping center. Go here for great Chinese."}
{"text":"We had gone here before a few years ago as they had a special Chinese New year celebration. We remember the food being yummy and so we decided to try them again.  We weren't disappointed.  The food was tasty enough and service was great . ~~~Had to UPDATE my review... And take off a star.   So excited to have yummy leftovers today only to open up the container and see that the waitress boxed my husband's shrimp with my beef.... ***NEWS FLASH*** I can't eat seafood!!!! Thanks for contaminating my food and wasting my money. SO disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant  with good lunch prices!  This chinese restaurant actually has good service, food,a nd prices - I came across this place during lunch and am a fan.   The food is tasty and not watered down ( which is a good sign that they don't cut corners). It has tasteful decor and and nice portions.   I recommend their orange chicken and beef with brocoli - which is freshly made .   Must try - if you like chinese food - you better start/stop here!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great and was expensive af. Also they shorted me a fried rice on the carry out. So two entrees, one small box of fried rice, and 6 potstickers for almost $50. Total crap and my family was still hungry since they were short a rice. First time there and I won't be back."}
{"text":"We use Dragon Wok delivery service. They are always faster than they promise, and friendly. The order is always accurate, the food hot, and most importantly, delicious!"}
{"text":"This one of the 1st Chinese place I've tried on the east side. I have to say that overall I really like them for a couple of reasons. First, they deliver to my place so that works great for me & they are always delivering it hot and faster than I was expecting. Second, they have the kind of crab puffs I love. Not fancy or overly crabby. Then finally they have a good sweet & sour sauce. I ordered (always do) the sweet & sour chicken & crab puffs. My hubby had the orange chicken. We are both picky about these favorite dishes. I like their S&S Chicken but would like it better with maybe better quality chicken. The chicken is good, but not awesome. My husband like the orange chicken and he usually doesn't at most places. He's also a die hard Panda Express orange chicken guy. The prices are good and the staff is friendly. I have only gotten takeout or delivery from here so far, but I am very happy with it overall."}
{"text":"i love family style dining.... The food was made fresh and was delicious!!!!! the service was great too. i have been looking for some good chinese food in my area and i think i found it. i wish they delivered."}
{"text":"I \"woked in\" pun intended, to Dragon Wok for the first time because I recently moved to the area. As another yelper's review said, \" the chairs were all over the place\". It looked like a wreck and it just opened 15min prior to me arriving and I was the only person there. For me the mark of a good Chinese restaurant is the ability for them to make a good dish of Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken. I proceeded to order both and told the cashier that i was going to dine in. She took my order and I sat down. As I watched a cobweb on the ceiling gently blowing in the wind I could not help to noticed that the cashier/order taker was also the cook. She was the only one working in the establishment.  As I waited for my order to be prepared and watching her long hair flop all over my food  I noticed that there were only 2 soy sauce bottles on the tables about 1/8 of the way full.  The tables were sticky. All the tables had salt but only 3 had pepper. Also the salt and pepper shakers had a oil/grease film on them. They obviously had not been washed in a long time. My food was finely done and it came in a Styrofoam box with my plastic fork that kept bending and my 1 napkin. Actually I was glad because maybe the plates would not have been washed either. My order was at par with other OK type Chinese restaurants. Nothing special. I would have given 3 stars if I would have had it delivered and not seen the wreck of a restaurant that it is. Now that I think about it I never saw the health department grade hanging anywhere. Hmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Ok I gotta stick up for this restaurant ... Seriously people need to stop with there bitch fits... I'm glad I don't listen to others.   So my bf and I just moved to the neighborhood and I love Chinese food so for lunch today we ordered from here... Man on the phone extremely nice order showed up in less then 30 min like he said... Food was scorching hot and delicious :) take advise from someone in the food industry and order from dragon wok!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood Chinese place w/OK food on a big menu.  I like their wok dishes like Hong Kong noodles.  Inconsistent cooking w/service oriented for take out.  Convenient and fast but don't expect gourmet."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast and it has taken me 3+ years to find a good chinese restaurant in Arizona. Excited that they deliver. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in the world (Besides China) No JOKE!! They have the fastest and friendliest service ever! The food is always and I mean always fresh and steaming hot!! You can even see for yourself if you look behind the counter into the kitchen.... the steam and flames!! To anybody who goes here I would definitely recommend the Egg Drop Soup, House Fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mein, and the Shrimp Fried Rice! They also have very big portions sometimes even too much!!! My family and I are locals there and we know one of the employees very well ...Lisa. This place is great you must come here to Dragon Wok the best fresh Chinese food ever!!  UPDATE: Lisa no longer works there and I believe it is under new ownership."}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas dinner, a'la A Christmas Story. We weren't the only ones with the idea! Very nice place. Had calamari for an appetizer, was spicy and wonderful. My main meal of lobster tail with shrimp and vegetables was a little on the bland side, though still very tasty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals too, and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was good but not outstanding...ordered delivery and had too call back to check if they were still coming because it took much longer than stated on the phone. Food arrived hot but one container had a lot of liquid in it and leaked all over everything else. Sweet and sour was a bit bland and the mongolian beef had was almost all peppers and onions with less beef than i thought appropriate.  Kung pow chicken was very good though."}
{"text":"I just received my food and it wasn't Chinese at all, it tasted like curry something ,but not egg fu young. I don't think they know what Chinese food is. Who is the cook and where is he from.  He needs to go back to school."}
{"text":"We got delivery and paid $33 for not a lot of food compared to what I'm used to from other places I've gotten before. I am partial to a crispier sesame/orange chicken and this was the opposite (very mushy and spongey)."}
{"text":"This place used to taste much better, now its just kinda plain and greasy.. You do get big portions for a good price... I was not impressed the last few times I was here, and I was starving.   They have coupons on the take out menus.. you can get something free ( egg rolls) for spending over $15..  but you need to ask for it.  It smells kinda funky inside... and servers cashiers could be nicer."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst food I have eaten in a long time.  It was disgusting.  The meat was soggy as if it were a frozen pre-cooked boxed meal cooked in a microwave.  I'm not one to ask for my money back for food, but I did on this occasion.  I told the owner that I thought the food was terrible and he threatened to sue me...for what I don't know.  This place should not be in business."}
{"text":"As you can see, I'm writing a lot of reviews these days because this is my last month on Yelp. Before I split, I wanna give credit to some of the unsung and under-appreciated small businesses in the NW area. DRAGON WOK is one of the better Chinese places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. And I believe it's even better than most places on Spring Mountain. Summerlin/NW does not have many traditional style Asian restaurants. But places like DRAGON WOK are the closest you will ever get.   This is not a generic panda express-like joint where food just sits out in a warmer. They cook it when you order it. They got amazing noodles here and the Orange Beef is also really great!   I know that I get a lot of criticism from other Yelpers about how I tend to give \"free\" 5-star reviews out if the restaurant is operated by an Asian-American. Maybe some of that is true, but you need to realize that I am a 4th generation Asian-American whose family were direct survivors of the internment.  I'm always going to support Asian-American owned small business. But, DRAGON WOK does deserve every star I give it."}
{"text":"I always call for delivery and I ALWAYS get great service!! The food portions are enough for 2 meals, which saves me money since I live alone. Whenever I want delivery, I call Dragon Wok. This is hands down the best Chinese food around!! I highly recommend them"}
