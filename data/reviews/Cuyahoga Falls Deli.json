{"text":"I have been on the hunt for a great deli sandwich shop in the area and so far this place has hit the spot. With a big sign out front that reads \"CORNED BEEF\" I figured that was were i should start. I got the regular corned beef sandwich on rye with swiss cheese and mustard. I decided to go with the grilled variety this time but im sure i will try the cold version another day. The corned beef was very good and the regular size portion was just right for a lunch. They have an overstuffed corned beef sandwich that was also very tempting. The sandwich was made to order and quickly. I will definitely return to try the gyro and other options off of their rather impressive menu. Don't let the outside of this small shop fool you, with great food and friendly staff i hope they stay around for a while."}
{"text":"Great first-time experience in this little deli next to Stricklands.    I ordered the classic reuben and was impressed.  They had it out to me quickly and it was delicious.  Not drowning in 1,000 $ sauce (as it's called on their menu), they let the quality corned beef do its good work.  Excellent mild swiss and a perfect amount of sauerkraut.  The pickle is top-notch, too.  Crisp and garlicky.  Would be nice to get a cookie, too, like Davis Delicatessen up in Woodmere, hint, hint.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time last night. Everything was good except for we ordered a \"bowl\" of soup and must have received a \"cup\" instead. the container was not much bigger than the salad dressing container for our salads.  I will order again but will not order soup at those prices for what you get.  UPDATE 6-22-13 - After ordering several times i have noticed a few things.   1. They have great food.  2. they seem to have a \"FAMILY OWNED\" mentality, They have closed early or have not been open for whatever reason.  They also don't seem to have enough help as i call (during open hours ???) and get a machine. ??? (I don't know whether to wait for a callback or go somewhere else as they close during hours quite a bit)"}
{"text":"Good food but they need some help. Like other reviews, they are somewhat committed to running this place. The few times I have gone it takes a good 15 minutes to get a sandwich. At lunch time, that is just too long for people on their lunch break. Like stated earlier, either they get help and do more to run the business, or they will keep losing customers. I hope they do more to run and build the business. They have good food!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to grab dinner after work today. The owner is really nice and easy to talk to. The sandwiches were amazing! We had the Cuban and Pulled Pork sandwiches and they were fantastic! We also got to try the cole slaw for free because we came during their 4-6 \"Hungry Hour\" and were not disappointed, very tasty. Lots of food for the money and everything was made to perfection. We will definitely be back and I would highly recommend this place if you are a sandwich fan!"}
{"text":"Really great food!   The atmosphere is cozy and awesome place to grab a bite to eat. We have been here a couple times and they have yet to disappoint. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Decent menu and food. I will return for a proper review after having more of their food.  After having a half rueben and half of a chicken cordon blue, I think I am a fan, but will need a future order to tell me so!  Attempted to try this place again and got the answering machine during their business hours! It said to leave message & they'd call back. Never got a call back so we won't be returning. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go. I stopped in for take-out a few times, and each time I was very impressed by the food here. The owner was so nice, and seemed so passionate about his food. I stopped by a few weeks ago, and it seems the business had closed for good. Shame."}
{"text":"We have only been here once, and my husband and I both got the same thing which was the corned beef. It really was a great sandwich, tons of meat and the rye bread was good too. I also live about a mile from here and have only been here once, and the reason is the price. It was pretty ridiculous, I think we spent at least $20 on 2 sandwiches and for a deli sandwich I believe that is just too much. They were fantastic and maybe one of the best deli sandwiches ever. It's a small place with weird hours but if you get a chance to go, it's definitely worth a try!"}
