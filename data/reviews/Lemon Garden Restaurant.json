{"text":"We stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant a few months ago. I was out for a morning walk with my son and we  passed by a lady heading into the restaurant. She stopped to tell us how great the breakfast was in the restaurant. We decided to go in and check it out for ourselves. It was great!!   It is a clean and quaint mom and pop restaurant. The food is chinese and western. They only have one waitress but she is a gem~  We generally make a trip there once a month."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and good each time. When I want chinese food, this is my go to place. Love the chicken chow mein, so good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love ordering  delivery from this cute little Chinese/Western Restaurant just off 33rd Ave. SW. I know I can select my favorite dishes and delivery will be prompt & courteous. The Special Yeung Chow Fried Rice is delicious! You must try it!!   I can't wait to place my next order :)"}
{"text":"Dinner was pretty good for Chinese food. A little salty but that's to be expected for Chinese. Small quite place."}
{"text":"My in-laws love to order from Lemon Garden. I think their best dishes are the Almond Chicken, Special Chow Mein (assorted meats and seafood), and Salt and Pepper Squid. I'm not a huge fan of their Ginger Beef, which is a little scrawny and too sweet for my taste.  Prices are about average to a little more than the norm in Chinatown, but Lemon Garden fills up the food to the top of the container. The food is tasty and we never wait long except on holidays.   If you have a hankering for an inexpensive cheeseburger and fries, check out Lemon Garden's version. Big juicy patty in a soft bun, with all the goodies (iceberg lettuce, thick slice of tomato, onion and mayo). Fries are crispy."}
{"text":"Classic local takeaway. I wouldn't travel far but as a neighbourhood business it's great. Salt and pepper squid is my fave. Good portions, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever almost , never really tried much else on the menu , only thing i ever have is the  monte christo , and I NEVER order a monte any where else . Real turkey real, real ham, no sandwich meat used here!  Gotta enjoy when when walk in even after a 6 month or longer break and they remember, monte christo today? To go or stay, is the only question I have to answer."}
{"text":"Nice quaint and humble southwest restaurant. The service here is fast and friendly. The food is tasty and priced perfectly ,great variety on the menu as well.This restaurant has been around for some time and for a good reason. It's a nice little gem if you want to sit down and enjoy your meal, or if you need to get in and out quickly. If your in the neighbourhood check it out."}
{"text":"You know how some restaurants are deemed 'Chinese & Western?'  Well, I've never really understood what that meant until I went to Lemon Garden.  They actually serve Chinese and Western food.  I finally get it!  Alright, so they've got your basic Chinese dishes to choose from; ginger beef, sweet and sour chicken, salt and pepper squid, chow mein.  But you can also get a bunch of different sandwiches, burgers, salad, and even chicken fingers!  It's the Western Selection side of things.  Both the Chinese and Western food is delicious!  It's always hot and usually pretty quick.  You can choose to dine-in at Lemon Garden, but they also do delivery and have the usual stipulation; free delivery within a 5km radius and minimum purchase of $25.  Who doesn't spend $25 when ordering Chinese, though?  I always overindulge!  This place is actually pretty perfect since they offer quite a selection.  Now, when someone doesn't want Chinese (crazy, I know) they can get something else.  No more fighting about what to have for dinner.  Everybody wins!"}
