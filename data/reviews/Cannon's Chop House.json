{"text":"For the love of God - pay attention.  Chef, do you know what Medium is - it doesn't mean well done.  Typical of the area - honestly - a handful of restaurants so your stuck."}
{"text":"For having just changed their name and much of their menu, we had an excellent business event here. We were in a private room in the back, and our server Brenden made the evening. Had a few appetizers and then a variety of the menu, including steaks, swordfish, seafood combo and the 'Football' loaded potato. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we agreed this is a great option.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We went for the All you can eat ribs on Monday night. My husband got the ribs which were served with beans and cornbread. He loved them! I got a cup of the gumbo to start. Spicy and flavorful, lots of sausage! Really good! I then had the Caesar salad with sirloin. Steak was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Caesar was good, but not outstanding. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was the service. While she was very sweet, we had a hard time finding her! My husband's beer never arrived, his ribs needed a refill and we couldn't find her! Overall though, we will definitely go back! The cedar plank salmon looked great as it went by our table!! This is a welcome addition to the great Southpointe town center area!!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, great service and the food was great 

Started off with potato soup and calamari which was very good. 

Ribs and fries was the main course. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and very tasty 

A must try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst steak house we have ever been to.
We went with another couple and our children.
Our children's steaks came out better than ours. Two of our steaks were sent back - one rare and one over cooked.
The service was even worse- drew had actually got into into a \"discussion\" it excuse that they were too busy at the bar. What does that have to do with the food? Regardless we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Service was fast and friendly. Food was just okay. Gumbo had a good flavor, but several of the vegetable pieces were very fibrous. The parts you would normally cut off and discard. The French dip was tasty but the bread was soggy before even starting."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on reviews and the menu but left a little disappointed. They have a nice formal area and a nice bar area with a lot of TV's around. My boyfriend ordered a beer and it came in a large frosted glass which was great, I ordered a Bloody Mary which tasted just like tomato juice. We got the fried green tomatoes and they were really good! I ordered a cheeseburger with a side Caesar salad, the burger was good but it was burnt along the edges which made it have the burnt char taste. I also asked for a side of mayo and was told they only have mayo in packets... for a nicer place like this they should not have packets of condiments. My boyfriend got the 1lb ribs with the gumbo and mashed potatoes, the ribs were very small, they looked nothing like the picture posted we saw, and they had the same burnt char on them which he didn't like. The gumbo was good (he's from Louisiana so he knows gumbo!) The main problem we had was with our waitress, she walked away without waiting for a response from us. At one point she asked how everything was and walked away in the middle of my boyfriend answering. She walked up to our table with her arms crossed and when we left she was sitting behind the hostess stand with her arms crossed with a sour look on her face and didn't say a word to us. With this being brand new I can understand some of the food issues but the service definetly needs to be improved. I think we'll try again in a couple months once some of the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"will never be back. the service was terrible. The waitress was nowhere to be found. She brought me the wrong drink and he response was its not her job to taste the drink. Very very slow. And on top of that a below average burger."}
{"text":"This is NOT Montana Rib and Chop the waiter told me that the changed the name to Cannons but kept the menu
WRONG they changed the menu and the quality.  Ordered baby back ribs, the ribs came and you could see where the used a wide brush to apply the BBQ sauce, the ribs were cold anywhere you cot into them and were hard .  I then ordered the 8 oz steak medium, when I got the steak it was hard to nut into on the outside and rare on the inside.  Never had this experience at the Montana Rib and Chop house in Denver,CO or Bozeman,MT"}
{"text":"Went for an early Valentines dinner. Server Tyler was great and so was the food. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I will never return to. It has high end steak house prices with Golden Corral quality food and almost no service. Everything, and I mean everything, we ordered was awful.  The salad was not crisp, and lacked any appeal.  The steaks were absolutely horrible quality.  The waitress didn't care one iota that we were there.  The so called sparkling wine was flat, no bubbles at all, and tasted horrible.  I sent it back, and opted for water instead.  We could not wait to get out of this restaurant, but sadly, we were many dollars lighter in the wallet when we did.  We very much regretted not going up the street to a fine restaurant that we knew was of high quality, which is Jackson's.  We will not make that mistake ever again."}
{"text":"Great food and phenomenonal service. We can with a group and has Bobby who busted his hump with a great and welcoming attitude and really made the night special. Lord knows there was enough of us but he had a smile on his face and a fun and embracing personality. Nice job bobby!


Nice beer selection, too notch steaks, beautiful atmosphere.cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My boss gave me a gift card to this chop house so
I figured my hubby and I would check it out on our 12th anniversary. We LOVED it!!! Burgers are AHHmazing, and we are both picky with our burgers!!! Our waitress was so nice and very engaging. The alligator is also delicious. We will definitely be coming back in the near future :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and the food was pretty good but the service was just average. The first time, they actually cooked our medium rare steaks to well done, but they politely took them back and fixed the problem. We will try again soon. We have high hopes for them."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant.  We were not disappointed!  Great atmosphere and the service was very good.  Had the baby back ribs, which were all you can eat this day.  Ribs were sauced just right and the meat was fall off the bone tender.  The server put in the order for our second plates of rib as soon as she set the first plates in front of us.  The ladies had salads that were good sized.  The half priced happy hour drafts complete a great meal.  The place was only half full this night but once Pittsburgers discover it, it will become a popular stop for ribs."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Cannons, but it gets the job done for lunch. Ive never eaten here for dinner, but it's a popular lunch spot in Southpointe. They usually have a risky ravioli special, which is my go to. I am never overly impressed my the food, but it is decent. The loaded bake potato is pretty good too. I've had a few salads at cannons and they are just okay, same with the burgers. I recently saw a flyer at the hostess stand that they now offer delivery select hours during lunch. I may have to update my review after trying their lunch delivery. I love convenience! I also love that that they have out door seating. The servers are always friendly, restrooms well kept, and there usually is never a wait. I would also consider Cannons good for groups."}
{"text":"First let me explain that I actually love this place and the serving staff/managers are the nicest, most attentive people ever. There steaks are really amazing cuts of beef. Their bar is top notch. It's a great restaurant aesthetically. The only reason why I gave this place only 3 stars is because half the time I come here my steak is not cooked correctly. I always order a medium rare ribeye steak. It's come out well done, raw and rare. I understand this happens occasionally but it shouldn't happen every other time I go there and it's a shame because the steaks themselves are top notch. I think they just need to give the kitchen staff meat thermometers until they learn how to judge the doneness of a steak better."}
{"text":"Awesome food was visiting from Florida, they opened a month ago. Friendly, prompt service. Looking forward to visiting again when I get back in town."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Staff extremely friendly. Waitress attentive. Those who got ribs were happy, though the ribs were very small for the price. But do not get the seafood platter. First bite of the flounder had a bone in it. The top fillet was fine, & the crabmeat was good. But the bottom fillet was literally not cooked. It was slimy, and could not be cut with a knife. You can't cut raw seafood with a serrated knife. The shrimp was nice quality, but no flavor or seasoning. And they ruined the beautiful sea scallops. They were so under-cooked that they could not even be cut with a knife. I tried to eat one, & it was like eating them raw. I did not eat the second one. 
I'm sorry to have to give such a poor review. But for $26, I expected something wonderful. I should have ordered the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Great streak house. 9 of 10 Steaks were cooked as ordered, the one that had to be sent back was back out to the table within 10mins. Which in my opinion isn't that bad. Squash casserole was surprisingly very good. The one thing I would caution you is when they say the plates are hot they are extremely hot. The steaks continue to while they are sitting on your table, be careful not lose your fingerprints by touching the plate."}
{"text":"When this place was Montana's it was amazing. Cannon's is, to be frank, kind of a hole. The new menu has lost all of the flavor and personality that once defined the restaurant. What's left is little more than fast food -- but priced like a very optimistic delusion of what it once was.

I can't recommend anyone go here anymore. Another tragedy of mismanagement murder."}
{"text":"poor service...at best. Tough to get a drink, tough to get your tab, and tough are their steaks."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and had a seat on the bar with a few other people.  I have a few great things to say about this place and one of them that really stands out was the service.  Our server was obviously experienced and cared about what she was doing.  She took the time to explain what seemed like a never ending list of specials and their menu.  

We ordered the ribs, fried green tomatoes (which were topped with lump crabmeat) gumbo, fried alligator, and a salad.  All of the food was good, we enjoyed everything there.  The table next to us had a steak delivered to them on a screaming hot sizzling plate and salmon on a burning cedar plank.  

Would definitely try this place again and they even have a nice patio area too."}
{"text":"The prices are a little high, but its totally worth it for a date night!! 
The food is spectacular.  I had the fried green tomato burger.  It was so good that im excited to try one of their steaks. :)
Our server, Michael w/ the beard is an amazing worker, super kind and helpful.
Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Burgers and steaks are excellent. Nice atmosphere and good service. Always stop in when in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled BBQ sandwich.  Nice atmosphere.  The gumbo is great for this area.  Staff was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"The only reason it's 4 and not 5 stars is because I only sampled a small portion of the menu. However, if everything is as good as I had tonight, I'm looking forward to increasing the rating at my next visit. My steak was absolute perfection. They were not shy with the butter. Lightly seasoned so as to enhance the natural aged flavor of the meat, it was sheer perfection. The baked potato was cooked perfectly and HUGE!! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Hubby had the cowboy cut steak and that was also VERY good, but not as good as my Rib Eye. Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. The best news is that they're very accommodating. They'll pretty much put together anything you like the way you want it. The service was very good as well. Well done Melissa!!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner and it was disappointing.  The mussels were extremely salty.  I told the server that and nothing was done.  They were eventually taken away.  I had the steak and it was good. My friend had the fish platter and it was beyond disappointing.  No flavor, overcooked and the stuffed flounder filet was gray and tasteless.  Again, more food left behind.  I would have hoped the server would have offered to send over the manager or take something off the bill.  Nope, nothing.  So that will be the last time I go."}
{"text":"Reserved two high tops in a corner away from the bar and dining room for a post election celebration. My party of 16 included people who worked very hard on the Trump campaign. We brought champagne for a toast and prepared to order dinner and drinks when management informed me that our Trump banner behind us-had been the subject of a customer complaint. Not wanting to put them in the middle I took it down. At the time we assumed it was one of four people at the bar. So when they left we put it back up. Immediately we were again told to take it down. Now it was apparent this wasn't coming from a customer complaint. I was told \"we don't do politics\". I responded \"you AREN'T engaging in politics, we are and even that isn't true because the election is over and he's the president\". They dug in and informed us that we would not be served until we removed the banner. I said, ok gang we're outta here. I tipped our waitress and thanked her. (Sadly it wasn't as generous as it would have been if we had ordered dinner. Do the math 16x100) As we left, almost everybody at the bar asked us for Trump stickers. We walked to the All Star Sports bar and they couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. And the wings are awesome. Between my girlfriend and myself we spend $1000 plus a month on food and drinks at the Montana Chop House. For two years I've eaten dinner almost every night there except Sunday. Needless to say after being publicly embarrassed I won't be doing that again"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in the South Hills/Washington area! I reccomond this place to every single person I can, as the food is always on point. 

Every time I have been here I have ordered to hot and crunchy shrimp appetizer, and it is something I dream about. They taste like the sesame sticks you buy at the store are crushed up and coat the shrimp, which are then deep fried. Served with habanero mango to dip the super crunchy shrimp in, make this appetizer amazing! 

I have had their sirloin, which comes served on a 350+ degree plate -  crazy! It was perfectly medium rare, juicy, and delicious. I have also had their chicken fried chicken which is a bit more dense, but just as flavorful. The only thing I don't care for there is their house dressing. It's some type of berry dressing, but it didn't have much flavor. 

Overall it has a great atmosphere, very attentive staff, and food you can't beat."}
{"text":"Party of nine on Friday night.  Place was not very busy.   Appetizers delicious - fried green tomatoes and calamari. Dinners eh.  The party ordered a variety of dishes from filet to burgers and ribs.  All burgers came out with unacceptably soggy buns in the lower half (obviously plated first and sat absorbing juices).  These were as though you scooped a tablespoon of broth on them. Gross buns were readily replaced with new buns that were on hand toasted to match the toasted top and were much better.  The taste of the burgers themselves and the additions were delicious- buns were the only problem. The pork, ribs and filet were all good quality and taste.   Wait staff was attentive, polite and knowledgeable about specials and our needs.   Would be five star if the buns weren't so bad - would even be four but they were beyond soggy.  No kitchen staff should send them out like that especially a high quality chophouse.  All for what a $0.25 bun? Although the burgers are lower cost they shouldn't receive less attention. We had prime rib last night elsewhere and just wanted what we thought would be a good burger. Kitchen staff should know to plate the burger on the bun last."}
{"text":"I'm really sorry to write this review! We always go there sometimes date night, family night or just a night out with friends. Most of the times we sit at the bar have some drinks and dinner. A friend and I met up on Friday night, bar area was busy so we sat outside. Our server came by we ordered a bottle of wine and an appetizer. Brought over the wine then we ordered our dinner \" Aged Ribeye Steaks Feature\" we both got the same , asked the server if medium would still be pink and she said yes. Before you know it we got the salad then not too long after another server \"food runner\" brought over the steaks. She asked who had the medium well and who had the well done- humm we both said nope we ordered medium \"some pink\" however let's take a look since you already brought it, it was extremely done WELL DONE! Our service came by with the manger who said it might be the lighting outside \" does not justify the rubbery taste\" it was definitely WELL DONE! 
She \" manger\" said those were out last two aged steaks so we ordered another steak no problem  \"which was perfect\". During our steaks the server brought over the check and said I will be back...... we finished dinner and she never came by. We put the cash in the check binder and I chased her down in the resturant to give her the monies \" included a 16% tip which was 16% more what she deserved unfortunately!! 
So many things were wrong with the service / food and management! Nothing was done about it after the fact! We waited for our steaks as our sides got cold and dry. Paid full price and were given the check while still eating dinner.... no one ever came by to check on us not even to take the check. 

This was a horrible experience that was not handled properly at all!"}
{"text":"Very modern and clean.
They have private rooms and a bar.
Very nice staff with interesting selections.
I had fried green tomatoes with crab and barbecued shrimp with garlic mashed potatoes. 
Well made interesting fresh food but the flavors aren't strong."}
{"text":"We did a search to find a seafood restaurant on the way home from the casino and we were pleasantly surprised! Our bartender Mika did not steer us wrong in our dinner choices and the gumbo soup that was on special that day was amazing! Everything else was cooked to perfection. Thank you for the experience!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a dozen times,  but never dinner or brunch. 

The food is always good. I like the brisket, the tomato basil soup, and the salads. 

It does get busy over the lunch hour so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with Montanas at all. Steaks were over cooked and the service was slow. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Once was wonderful. The quaity of the food and service are on the decline. Seated and waited twenty minutes for our server. When food finally came, had to request silverware, although food was disappointing, as it has been the past few visits the staff apears to be totally disinterested. Don't know that we'll ever return."}
{"text":"Foods not bad but the steaks are over priced for what you get. My ribeye was pretty bland and on the tougher side, not something you would expect from an expensive steak. They have a good beer selection and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great location and great food! Atmosphere is relaxing and perfect place to eat after a long day. Drinks were very good as well as the food. I had a Moscow mule, cheeseburger and fries, they forgot to add the bacon, but it was so juicy and delicious that I didn't mind!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in town! Food is so good and the staff this great too! If you are looking for a decent happy hour, they have wine for like $2.50 a glass!"}
{"text":"This used to be my boyfriend & I's go-to place. I booked a reservation for tonight to celebrate his birthday. (He loves their baseball cut steak) Underwhelmed would be an understatement. We were seated promptly, but that's where the good service ended. We waited 10 minutes plus after being seated to even receive a drink menu. We were looking to take our time and enjoy the evening but our waitress seemed to be distracted, and maybe just downright annoyed, which really put a damper on what should have been a great evening. My lemon drop martini was beyond weak and warm, and I don't think I've ever ordered a martini I didn't love.  We got the calamari to start which was delicious but our salads came out simultaneously. We both asked for dressing on the side but the cups had tipped over and poured out onto our salads. He ordered steak, I ordered salmon. Both entrees were good but my side and his didn't come out with the rest of the meal. The asparagus cake out a few minutes later and my baked potato cake out even after that, with no butter or sour cream! I mean COME ON! We constantly were asking for more water (whenever we could find our waitress) because the glasses weren't refilled on their own.  To top it all off, the table next to us was ordering later after we had our entrees and we found out we had never been told the specials or the fact that there were happy hour specials. I so badly want to give one of our favorites a good review, but am so disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Montana's on a Friday night. We didn't have a reservation but the wait was only about 15-20 minutes. I was surprised at how small it is inside, but the bar area is a nice size. The service was very good. I got the special, which was sword fish with a lime cream sauce. It was to die for! I couldn't eat it fast enough! My husband ordered a steak and he loved it as well. Our bill was over $100, after our meals, drinks, and appetizer... So if you go, prepare to spend; but I do think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing filet! Cooked and seasoned perfectly! Our waitress was Sherry and she was fantastic. She was very social with us and build great rapport with our party of 6. Looking forward to dining at Cannon's again!"}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch today with a large group. They took care of us very well. Service was good and good was excellent. We got stuffed mushrooms with crab. The sauce on them was great. I got a bacon Swiss chicken sandwich. Just the right amount of cheese w/ to accent the chicken nicely. My wife got the Po Boy Sandwich she said it was ok, but probably  would not order it again. The seasoned fries were excellent. Cook just right to have that nice crisp on the outside, delicious. 
 Overall a great experience and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food , fast service . The only reason I am giving it three stars is because it took them 15 minutes to come collect my check . I wouldn't mind it hanging around in the evenings but not on a working day at lunch hour.."}
{"text":"Love it! Best part it's minutes from my house. Went here with a large group. The service was fast. The soup was awesome, my wife loved the fried green tomatoes. I had the gumbo and she had the salmon, both were excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group of friends on a Saturday night.  Great atmosphere.  Our waiter, Elliot was excellent - great service and plenty of comedy.  He managed the table well and kept us updated on our order due to a larger party the kitchen was dealing with.  It did take a longer than usual to get our food, but because we knew what was happening it wasn't an issue.  

Food was very good - the Fries Green Tomatoes were delicious and my Baseball Cut Top Sirloin was perfectly cooked.  

Food prices were as expected - the wine prices are either great or bad - $ 6 for entry level then suddenly $ 13 for something more refined.

Overall, a very nice evening meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to South Pointe and I was amazed by the development in this area.  Coffee shops, frozen yogurt, banks, little stores, apartments, and lots of industrial offices surround the Montana's Rib and Chop House.  Because of said development, I wasn't expecting much.  I figured here we have a chain restaurant located in the midst of a bunch of new businesses and I'll likely get a so-so experience.  Not the case.

While Montana lacks ambiance and creativity in it's space it makes up for it with really tasty food and good service.  I had the filet tips with crab meat and found everything cooked perfectly and covered in delicious sauce.  It came with a terrific side salad with very good dressing.  I was with a fairly large group and I can tell you that not one person at my table had anything left on their plate - we were all very satisfied.  We shared a pecan meltaway and a satin pie and that too was devoured quickly!

This is a great place to go for dinner with a group and to enjoy a decent steak.  They also have a nice selection of burgers and also seafood.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new steak place and decided to try this one. We received great service and the food was delicious. We tried the buffalo steak, something we've not had since we moved from the SW and it was as expected. My spouse did send back his flavored margarita, it was way to sweet. He switched to a regular and was more than satisfied. The restaurant didn't charge us extra for the change. We will go back."}
{"text":"Second visit to Cannon's. Just as good as the first. Located in Southpointe in Canonsburg, this Chop house delivered another delicious meal. I had the Chicken Fried Steak. Light crunchy coating, seasoned well, with creamy garlic mashed potatoes. Steak was fork tender, juicy. A tasty white country gravy comforter over top made for a delicious meal. Family had the Pork Pot Roast. Tender, juicy, cut it with a fork. Side of creamy delicious mashed potatoes. Then the Spicy crunchy burger. A half pound burger with a breaded and fried hot cheese. A light and soft bun, half pound burger cooked perfect, with the breaded hot cheese, topped with onions and bbq sauce added. Everything was great, definitely worth the trip to Southpointe."}
{"text":"Thought I would come down and check this place out for brunch on Sunday . I was amazed at how low the prices were . It had a great atmosphere don't know what it is but something fun about people drinking mimosas in the morning. Took a little longer then what I expected to get my food and it was just ok . Looking forward to going back so I can get. Better review."}
{"text":"This was for my Birthday celebration with the fam. . It was last Sat night. We had reservations and arrived on time. The place was packed, the host said our table would be ready in a few.  We waited for 20 min.  the Host was super apologetic,  gave us a free appetizer. You don't mind when you get an acknowledgment and a freebie! This is a newer restaurant and they are ironing out the kinks. The food was good ,and in their favor, came out piping hot. The free wing appetizer was terrific.  We enjoyed the upbeat atmosphere and saw a few friends. We'll be back when things settle a little. Not a bad beginning."}
{"text":"I went  several times while working in Cannonsburg. The steaks are fantastic. Service was not always predictable, but overall good."}
{"text":"Still a solid 4.  A large group of us had one of the back rooms for a work luncheon today. We were treated well by our 2 servers and I think everyone was happy with both the food and the service we received. I had the Ahi Tuna with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. I had the tuna cooked rare and it was absolutely perfect. A nice sear on the outside and rare in the middle. It came along with some wasabi and ginger and was placed on a bed of spinach.  The sides were both as expected. Overall another good experience. Ask about their military discount, it's a good one!"}
{"text":"Came out on a Friday night, around 10pm. I ordered the brisket ($13), it comes with a soup or salad and a side. I ordered asparagus and a cesar salad. The sauce they served with it was way too salty for me. I ate the brisket with the BBQ sauce on the table. The brisket was okay but dry for me. My grandmother ordered ribs, the St Louis ribs which have more fat than meat on them and the waitress failed to let her know that. We didn't get a refill on our water during our visit. The waitress barely checked up on us. The manager came over and asked if everything was okay and we informed her about the ribs and she said we could pick a desert of our choice for the inconvenience. Very kind of her, but the waitress came back with a nasty attitude. The food was okay and the service was not great. - again I'm used to Texas BBQ so yes my opinion is biased. And the brisket does not compare."}
{"text":"Dined there last evening with a group of 16.  I was supposed to have 2 waitresses but only had one.  Unfortunately, she was overwhelmed and rightly so.  Took 1/2 hour to get our drinks but she said the bar was busy and also took time to take our dinner orders.  The food came out fairly quickly from the kitchen.  The food was hot and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I am faulting management for not providing 2 waitresses.  It's difficult for one person to serve 16 in a timely fashion and get everything correct plus wait on other tables."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deal! 1/2 off draft & bottle beer and great service.  Can't beat $1.80 for a draft. We left a surrounding bar where we were paying significantly more & the service wasn't all that great. Highly recommend Montanas Rib & Chop House! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant that was very busy.  Simple decor with a lot of windows.  There is an outdoor patio area that was busy on a cool evening.
We couldn't wait for the fried green tomatoes and were not disappointed.  Very tasty green tomatoes with blue cheese, lump crab meat and a balsamic.
Had the Fulton Street ribs, which were 1 lb. or a half rack, a long plate of ribs that they say are slow cooked then finished on a grill with a light glazed homemade BBQ sauce.  The ribs were tender and tasted very good.  I like the BBQ sauce, it was not to sweet and not spicy but added a nice flavor.  For a side I had the sweet potato fries, that were just not up to par."}
{"text":"The fried green tomatoes and spicy shrimp apps were very good. Loved the St Louise ribs although they did have sauce even though they said dry rub on the menu. Our waiter John was really fun and helpful. The filet tips with crab meat were \"pretty darn good\". Our nine year old said her salad was \"tremendous\"! Definitely would come back soon!"}
{"text":"Saturday night dinner, first timer at Montana's. Expectations were high based on the higher steak prices (about 50-70% higher than the chain steakhouses Outback, Longhorn etc).
Service was below average for this price range, not attentive, burger joint caliber. No bread or butter on the table. They serve your salad dressing in a small container on the side, even for a Caesar's salad. The container does not contain enough dressing, asked for a little more and the server said Upcharge! The upcharge was 25 cents, they really need that quarter! Wife had the Shrimp and scallop alfredo linguine. It was tasty but they sliced the whole scallops into 1/8 to 1/4\" slices to have the appearance of \"more\"!. My 10 0z Baseball cut Sirloin at 27 bucks was on the tough side even at medium rare, the side of squash casserole was dry, and luke warm to cool in temperature. Wife asked to box her remaining dinner, server plopped a styrofoam box on the table. The chains do a much better job at around $15 bucks for a 10 oz sirloin. Wine list was fairly reasonable. Montana's steak prices range from $27 to $48, very high for the lackluster meal and service. No reason to return, going back to Longhorn or Outback for our next steak fix!"}
{"text":"Location and place is good. But you can try to avoid the items we had. Almost leave everything."}
{"text":"Good food.  Our server, Alex, was super awesome.  It was service that we will remember for a lifetime."}
{"text":"I can go detail as to what makes this place my new favorite statehouse but suffice to say the food is outstanding, the portions are ridiculous and the staff is out of this world."}
