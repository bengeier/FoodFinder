{"text":"BackYard BBQ is inside the Hard Hat Bar. I went to the bar for Karaoke Thursday and met Mr. Vegas Boss. He is a cool guy. I love spicy food so I ordered the Hotlink and fries combo. It was delicious. The link had just the right amount of spice and was served on a bun. The fries are cooked to order from hand cut potatoes. I Love Love Love BackYard BBQ! They have the best Hotlinks in Vegas. I will definitely be back. Great food at Great prices!"}
