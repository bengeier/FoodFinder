{"text":"We ordered the fish \"platter\", which cost around $50 before tax.  The fish was fine, but too boney for my taste.  In general, the food was too seasoned and salty.   Portions were okay but not huge, definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Was super excited to eat here and ordered the veggie pot. On the menu they label the 'soy sauce' sauce with one chili, the 'special sauce' with 2 chilies so we went with spicy with 3 chilies figuring it was the mildest (it goes up to 5 or 6 chilies) it was so hot it was literally unedible. The manager gave me 10% off but their spice category is whack and they should tell ppl or let ppl try the sauce first as the whole dish is covered with it. They ruined the vegie pot with the sauce

Super disappointed and would not go back or recommend"}
{"text":"The quantity and quality of the food isn't worthy of the expensive price!!! It 's really a cheat!"}
{"text":"Poor service. The wait staff avoided taking our order. Sat there waiting for 10 minutes before I had wave someone to take our order, even then the waiter had an attitude."}
{"text":"Saw this new restaurant open around the corner of this plaza that we come all the time, thought we will try it. Super taste. Pricy for Chinese food. We ordered sea food flour simmer pot, and mango bubble tea, 3 of us spend around 100$. the blender is very loud barely can have conversation when it is on. Service is pretty bad. We liked the food so the food worth it still."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
?????????????"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to their pre-opening event to get a feel and give my honest feedback before they opened for the Montreal community. 

First of all the location is prime, right next to Concordia university it's smack downtown and the decor is modern and clean.  A must stop for a unique dinning experience. 

The concept is unique and different for most Montrealers, it's not your classic Italian pizza joint or Greek souvlaki it's something completely new in the downtown core. This type of cuisine is super popular in China and I'm very happy they are introducing it to Montreal. Basically you can order a preset pot or make your own. We made our own, first we chose the special sauce and then we chose our proteins: shrimp, chicken wings, octopus and bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms. We also opted for the 8$ surcharge to make it a soup afterwards and for that we chose the vermicelli noodles, broccoli and seaweed. 

Now that our order was placed we waited for the server to come back and start the cooking right in front of us! It was like a show, first she put the vegetables in the pot (it's a standard premix of yummy veg). Then she laid the beautiful proteins we had chosen. They mixed the sauce and poured it over. It was quite the experience seeing your food made in front of you! 

The end result was extremely tender chicken wings, juicy shrimp and the best bacon wrapped mushrooms I've ever had. The braising technique imparts to much flavour and the sharing of a pot brings a community feel and makes you engage and eat slower. I love how they added water at the end to make it a soup, it was SO tasty. 

You are sharing a pot with 1-2 people so make sure you know them well or want to get to know them well haha. 

It's a fun and different dinning experience for us Montrealers!"}
{"text":"Expensive and not worth it. We took the combo E which is a pot with fish, shrimps and cuttlefish with the special sauce. The quantity was quite small for 55$ and rice is extra. We shared that between 3 people and we were not full afterwards. The sauce is way too salty and since everything was smudged in the sauce, it was hard to finish the pot. 

The service at first was great. The girl patiently explained the menu to us and they took the time to prepare our plate. However, after the food was ready, we basically became invisible. Our individual plate is small and was filled with fish bones and shrimp shells, but no one bothers to change it. 

I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Service: overall good service for a Chinese restaurant. Servers were attentive and there were a good amount of them.

Food: the flavour was pretty good but didn't WOW me. Had 5 different kind of meat and beef was definitely my favourite one. Frog legs were my least favourite as they didn't taste fresh. Squid tentacles were nothing special as the intestine was not bad, but had better.

Price: definitely on the pricier side. The bill for three of us was $130.

Will probably be back."}
{"text":"We tried the other locations before?the food tasted really bad?but my friends and I went to the Hwy 7 one for dinner?and we ordered the seafood platter with salty sauce?the food taste fresh and yummy?the portion was good for 3 ppl?we also like the sweet potato and garlic inside the pot. I definitely recommend it and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Tasted great, got the personalized pot and chose 4 meats with special sauce (wasn't even spicy). A bit pricey but if splitting with others totally fine."}
{"text":"Are u kidding?we order a hot pot of chicken and add 4 kind of ingredients....it's already more than 100 $,and the portion was small....I was disappointed with it,the taste was not wow......it's first time here and last time too...sorry!"}
{"text":"Sat here for 10 mins and I still can't seem to get a waiter to give us a glass of water. They are constantly cleaning the place and no pay attention to customers needs!! I'm at the point where i want to just get up and leave.
When I was finally able to hunt someone down that waiter decides to go to every table before coming over! Omg wtf! None of those ppl even had their hand up waving down anyone! Why did we get asked last?!?!?! 
Terrible/ WORST customer service EVER!!!

Now let's finally talk about the dessert. The menu looked exactly like what they served in Hong Kong so that really got my attention! 

1: I got the mango trio dessert: it consist of mango purée, coconut milk, black glutinous rice.
The coconut milk was so obvious that they blend slush and water cause it was so watered down that I can only taste hints of the coconut. Without the colour I don't think I'd be able to tell. Same with the mango purée is all slush 2% mango flavour!  Last ingredient in the dessert the black glutinous rice. It was so clumpy that I feel like it had the appearance of chunky potato soup, it definitely needs to be warmed up ... 

My friend got their jumbo mango bowl, it has the mango purée, ice cream, mango pudding and glutinous balls. Honestly this was not better than mine. Glutinous balls did not taste fresh, they had a taste how it's a day old. The mango ice cream would be better if they just used store bought himes from tnt super market. 

Would I ever come back? NEVER"}
{"text":"Located near guy Concordia station. Popular Chinese hot pot cuisine. Tons of people were there today. Nice traditional Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"I will eat Simmer Huang on days that I want hot pot but am not hungry enough to eat AYCE hotpot. Simmer Huang starts off as a simmering pot with a veggie base and customizable meat toppings. My favourite toppings after 2 visits are the chicken wings and the cuttlefish. Everything is cooked table side by diligent timer armed Simmer Huang employees. They have a selection of different sauces that tend to be on the saltier side for the veggies but work wonderfully for the meats. Once you are done savouring the simmered stew like pot, they will add broth to your pot and turn it into a hotpot. 

Overall, for a pot containing 4 meat toppings with an additional 5 hotpot items, the bill will settle around $80. The quantity of food will feed 2 hungry individuals or 4 not hungry individuals."}
{"text":"I went for the grand opening and it was packed. I really enjoyed the experience, the ambiance, the freshness and flavor of the sauces and spices used in preparation...I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"$$$$, expensive. But the hotness is awesome. I picked 'Spicy' and it's definitely very spicy.  Service was good. Some are passionate but sometimes when they are really busy, they forget things. Make sure to request again. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. It smells good. However, the price is quite high. It is so expensive if there is not discount or promotion."}
{"text":"They have some pretty good lunch specials here so we gave it a try.  It was absolutely a bang for my buck.  Portions were generous.  Service was great.  Food was pretty good too.  They seem to use the same sauce for everything...but I don't mind the sauce.  It's quite flavourful.  It's now on my list of places to go for lunch."}
{"text":"If you want to pay $20-30pp for little chicken and veggie that weren't even fresh (it's precut and yellowish), you're better off spending your money on some  cheap AYCE BBQ or chinese hotpot, at least you won't feel empty afterwards (both your wallet and  your tummy).  For the portion and the quality of the food, it was way overpriced.  

You get to choose your \"main course\" which is a pot of your choice of meat/fish plus a bunch of pre cut veggies including carrots, celery and sweet potato, etc. The pot itself varies from ~$40 to $60. It says one pot can serve 2-3 people but indeed more like for two. Rice isn't included.

If you feel it's not enough after the main course, you can pay more for the soup base and additional side dishes. I saw the other table ordered a bunch of enoki (exactly the size of one pack that you can find at supermarket) and it's like $6-7.  

I agree with all the 1-star reviews (the one at yonge street; the two locations are the same).  You are basically paying a premium  to look at someone put the food into a pot in front of you.  Not only did we have to wait for the server to come to your table and put the food into the pot, but we also had to wait for the food to cook. So you're looking at around 30-45 mins to have the food ready. 

For the \"secret sauce\": at first we were hoping for some really impressive, as the server was like stirring and stirring and the sauce got thicker and thicker...looked fancy... but it didn't taste  anything special. Moreover, I saw that a chef/kitchen staff sitting at one of the tables and stirring some white milky liquid and poured into the sauce. I think there's much corn starch in the sauce...  no wonder it's so thick. 

My suggestion is - avoid Simmer Huang."}
{"text":"It's very expensive! 
But it was delicious. 

The portion looks like a lot but once you start eating, it's barely enough for 3 people. 
(2 men, 1 lady) 

There are other restaurants in the area that are better and not as expensive. I may go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is NOT closed. Randomly discovered this place when I came for dessert at Hui Lau San (I know... its very random and odd). Unfamiliar with this type of cuisine, we learnt that this restaurant is widely popular in China and they are known for their \"secret sauce\" which come looking like a gluey tar.

To start... The service here exceeded my expectations for a Chinese restaurant. First you pick a pot (good for 3/4 people) with your choice of meat then the server will prepare/cook it for you on your table with the \"secret sauce\". When the server finished cooking we noticed some of the veggies on the bottom were burnt. We didn't think it was a big a deal since the food didn't taste burnt. However, the manager came over and apologized for the burnt veggies saying that the server that cooked for us is new and our pot is burnt. She not only offered to take 15% off our bill, but also compensated us with their Signature Cold Noodle on the house.  Per Chinese restaurant standards we were very impressed with their attentiveness and customer service.

After the food in the pot are finished you can add soup to it and it turns into a hotpot. But you have to order all the meat/veggie dishes separately. 

Overall, the food are okay but on the pricier end for chinese food."}
{"text":"Unique, value, tasty. Visited Simmer Huang thinking it was a hot pot place, until i saw no broth in every table's pot!!! 

They can get a bit pricy, but you do get a ton of food. We got the lamb pre-set combo which included a variety of veggies, and lamb. Also added beef tendon to our combo. The two of us probably only ate 60% of it, and we were very hungry. 

They bring up all the raw ingredients and cook it in front of you - and by cook, they put the food in the pot and let it simmer with a timer on the side. I find it to be very neat! You see your food getting cooked in front of you. 

The food itself was delicious. Lots of meat and veggies. Lamb tasted amazing and so did the beef tendon. For our main, we got corn bread (?)...reminded me of China!"}
{"text":"Nouveau resto chinois à côté de Concordia. 

C'est une chaîne de restaurant en Chine, concept \"dry pot\" qui peut devenir un \"hot pot\" si tu décide d'ajouter de l'eau avec d'autres viandes/légumes à ton pot à la fin.

La nourriture est bonne. 
Le Service est super. Le serveur arrive à la table avec le pot et dispose les légumes/viandes/fruits de mer/sauce en couches dans le pot, jusqu'à temps que ce soit cuit. 

Le prix est un peu cher. Nous avons eu leur promotion d'ouverture, mais en général, chaque pot coûte environ 50$, pour 2-3 personnes. On a pris 2 pots à quatre, avec deux bols de riz et des pancake chinois, et on est arrivé juste. 
Je le recommande à ceux qui veulent l'essayer, c'est une belle expérience. :)"}
{"text":"This is a chain store that has a very interesting concept. You choose either a combo of meat/seafood or your own group of main ingredients. These are cooked with root vegetables in a pot in front of you. In the pot, there is about 1/2 a cup of butter or lard and 3 ginormous spoonfuls of sauce that you chose. It ranges from salty to very spicy. We chose a mildly spicy sauce. There are additional ingredients that you can choose and it is added AFTER you've finished your meat/seafood and cooked with additional water.

The service is pretty fast and we didn't have to wait too much. The place is really clean and spacious. 

Our impression was that the meal was excessively salty!  This time, it wasn't just me, because I usually think most restaurant foods are too salty. This time, it was everyone at my table. Basically, it was only after about 3 litres of water had been added to the pot that it became bearable.  If you have the choice, ask them to put only enough sauce to cover half the ingredients. Or just ask them to add the water right away. Who cares about \"how\" it's supposed to be eaten. If you feel like every mouthful that you eat is just plain salt, it defeats the purpose.  Anyhow, they leave the sauce in the bowl on the side, so you could always add more later. In the meantime, we had enough salt intake to last us through the next week!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Simmer Huang since it opened many years ago. At first, the service was good, as well as the food. Unfortunately, over the years, their service quality has greatly declined. 

Honestly, I don't think the price range sould be labeled as $$$$. It's more like $$$.

Service: 2/5
These days, it's not uncommon to hold your hand up for a good 5 minutes without anyone coming, even when they are overstaffed compared to the customer volume. The servers' attitude isn't hostile but it isn't friendly either. They also didn't bring water or tea unless asked. Theres usually one enthusiastic server out of the whole staff.

Food: 4.5/5
I've always liked the food here. The sauce is great and very unique in my opinion. I often order the hand pulled noodles which they pull infront of you at your table. The cilantro isn't that fresh though.

Cleanliness: 4.5/5
The chopstick sleeve holding my chopsticks had dried sauce on it (obviously used before). Otherwise I'd give it a 5/5."}
{"text":"Must eat in Montreal!  Love the way they make the food. Delicious and healthy!!!!

simmer huang has over 600 locations all over the world. If you got a chance, invite friends to try it. Don't go by yourself, coz the pot is big enough for 2-3 ppl."}
