{"text":"1st time here today and the food was fantastic! The passion fruit dressing was to die for. I had the Cubano Sandwich and wife had a fried plantain sandwich. The beef and veg soup was so good with the cilantro they put in. Coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Had the queso Frito, and highly recommend it. Also had the tostones and they were very enjoyable as well. Love the salsa that comes with them! For dinner we had pabellon a cabello, arepas and empanadas, all we would highly recommend. One of the best gems in Madison!"}
{"text":"Visited based on other Yelpers.  Thank you people!!!!   I loved that the owner explained the dishes to me.  Made me want to try them all!  I am in town for one more night and will go back.  The fresh passion fruit juice was wonderful and I also thought the tamarind juice was great.  Tough decision.  Had the national dish of Venezuela.  Black beans, rice and beef.  Perfect comfort food on a cold November day.  Also tried the fried yucca.  Wonderful!!! Prices were so reasonable and portions are huge!"}
{"text":"We've been back to this place several times and their food has always maintained its high quality.   I wanted to update my review by talking about their burgers.  This is not a typical madison burger (and I love the typical Madison burger).  It is, however, a truly authentic Latin American burger.  The burger is a pressed patty piled high with lettuce, tomato, onion, ham, a fried egg, bacon, cheese and shoestring potato chips. This burger is exactly like the hamburgers I ate when I used to live in Brazil and my husband (who is Brazilian) loves them.  I know this is a Venezuelan place (I can only assume this is also like a Venezuelan burger having never been there myself) but I could almost say they make an authentic Brazilian hamburger.  If this is something you have been looking for (or are curious) I recommend checking out the hamburger here.  If not, their other selections, which I talked about in my other review, are really great as well."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by what this place looks like on the outside. From the outside it looks like a total hole in the wall but the inside is much better lookin'!   And the food? Outstanding. You get so much food for so little money. The guy working the counter (he could have been the owner?) spent quite a bit of time explaining the Venezuelan cuisine to our party and helped us pick out a number of items from the menu. After our first round we had to order a few more things because everything was so good. I highly recommend the tajadas con queso and empanadas if you're looking for a quick bite for lunch and in intro to the cuisine. The Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito? YES.  This is a great addition to the Madison restaurant scene and I hope that it is successful!"}
{"text":"This place is the Hidden Gem of Madison. Fresh, delicious,clean,friendly,excellent entrees though I can not pronounce the name...the Taste Broke all Language Gaps! From Arizona but will remember next time in Madison."}
{"text":"This. This thing. This thing called a \"Patacon Pisao.\" I can't imagine a more perfect thing than this.  It eats and tastes like nothing else... the flavors, the spices, the texture, the fact that you'll need two hands and a scuba suit to eat the damned thing. Or a big bathtub and two consenting adults.  But how addicting. When a craving hits you, you'll have no choice but to end up at La Taguara.  Just awesome."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  First, you should know that the place doesn't have typical table service. You order at the counter, but they will take it to your seat. The server/cashier that was working was incredibly helpful.  The food was excellent. Everything we had was very flavorful. For those who fear that Latin cuisine is too spicy, know that everything we had was well seasoned, but not spicy.  For dessert, I recommend the rice pudding.  If we're ever in town again, we will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"After having lived in South America and Central America and returning home to Madison, this place is our new favorite restaurant. The food is delicious and the owner is very friendly. We ordered the pabellon, Tequeños de Guayaba y Queso, and Papelon con Limon. Pabellon was delicious--black beans were very well seasoned, as was the meat. Tequenos de Guayaba y Queso tasted like funnel cakes, stuffed with ricotta cheese, and yummy fruit jelly. They were wonderful too. The lemonade was also refreshing.  Having eaten a lot of good food while living/traveling in Latin America, we are picky when it comes to good Latin American food. We are so happy that La Taguara is around."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacularly delicious! And the owner works the cas heir and is one of the friendliest people to ever work in a restaurant! He knows all of his regulars so when my wife and I walked in, he sat us assise and held a great conversation which included some of his top picks off the menu. Additionally he gave us free taste gratings of the specialty drinks!   Overall great experience, amazing customer service, and delicious food!  I highly recommend it to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"Good food, service was average, food was lukewarm arriving. Tasty once reheated though!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the food was great. I had the pabellon, the Venezuelan national dish that is the house specialty. A generous portion of shredded beef, rice and black beans, fried plantains with an arepa. Tom had the sauteed garlic shrimp and was equally pleased. The service was pleasant and helpful. We plan to make it a regular spot and are happy to recommend it.  Don't be put off by the small place and the simple decor. It may seem a bit pricey for the setting, but the portions are generous and the food outstanding."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. Our meals were amazing and the customer service was phenomenal. They are very welcoming, explain the menu options, and give recommendations to those new to this type of food. We will most certainly return to this gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get their signature cubano sandwich. Enlightened to find a amazingly friendly staff. Upon looking around while waiting for our sandwiches I noticed their cool venesualen decor, and several awards, when my sandwich arrived I realized why. Hands down the best cubano sandwich I've ever had in my life, with amazing crispy plantain chips. This experience has changed my life. Thank you so much La Taguara! Please keep it up and never change. We will be life time customers for sure. Can't wait to try the arepas"}
{"text":"Being from South American and recently moving to Wisconsin, I was craving some Latin cousin. Then I found this place the arepas are amazing I usually get mine with shredded chicken or beef with white cheese (recommended), I also tried the empanadas they are really good too and for dessert I had a churro wasn't the best but it was good. I recommend this place, and enjoy some Venezuela and Colombia cousin"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and fresh. My buddy and I decided to try it out. He ordered the Taguara burger which had alot going on. He said it was awesome. I ordered the churrasco criollo. Very delicious. Very clean inside and good latin music that kinda took me back to Puerto Rico there for a minute. Never had yuca fried. Good but a little dry. Even though I never ate Venezuluen food I grew up eating latin food and this is the real deal. Definitly making another visit when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Checked out the new Venezuelan place tonight. Super authentic. Moderate pricing. We tried the pabellon and the mojito en coco. The first is the national dish and the second was a fish dish. The national dish was great but not super exciting but all the accompaniments were great. The fish was ok with great sides but I wish it was t mashed up so much. There is a lot of other promising looking dishes. The arepas are super. We had a chicken and beef empanada and the chicken was better."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful and friendly staff, definitely worth a visit! The staff was extremely helpful when we walked in and took the time to introduce us to the menu and offered us some drinks to sample--which were all sweet and delicious.  My husband and I are fans of the tamarind drink. Both for us enjoyed our food as well--the fried plantains were amazing!  The portion sizes are generous and neither of us was able to finish our main dishes, which means yummy leftovers.  We'll be going back."}
{"text":"I visited La Taguara because I love arepas and I was well pleased with the options I had there. I ordered two, one black bean and one shredded eggplant. The black bean option was a messy, delicious, classic. The shredded eggplant was an unknown to me when I ordered it and it turned out to be amazing. The eggplant was treated similar to pulled pork and was bursting with savory, flavorful sauce.  I sampled the pancake part of the cachapa con queso and it was amazing. It was much sweeter and more corn-flavored than the arepa dough, and I'm tempted to order a cachapa with black beans or eggplant in the future to see if they would do it. That's not to say the arepa dough wasn't awesome too, just different.   We also sampled the juices, and though I'm not a big juice drinker, I'd definitely go for the passion fruit or tamarind if you are. The tostones were decent, but in the future I'd probably skip them to save room for arepas.   The main downside: the atmosphere is essentially that of a fast food chain. This is perhaps good, as it's embarrassing to drip sauces down your chin, hands, and fingers at a finer dining establishment (and with arepas, you will), but I'd love to see the harsh, commercial edges softened in favor of warmer, more welcoming furnishings and decor. The service is very friendly and welcoming; I hope someday the atmosphere is as well!"}
{"text":"I went to give this place a try since it has many good reviews. I asked for two arepas (shredded beef and chicken) both meats were ok, the arepas were too thick and no flavor at all, I had them with a side of rice and black beans ( they were good). My hubby had the Pabellon and he liked it. We also tried the Tamarindo and the passion fruit juices and they were very good, being from Central America I know what they really taste natural and those juices were the real thing. I have to mention that the lady at the counter ( I am guessing she is one of the owners) was very friendly, it was our first time and she guided us through the whole menu and we really appreciated that. We would come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Chose this place based on good reviews on Yelp. I went with my husband and my somewhat conservative dining parents (read: steak and potatoes) and everyone loved their meal. I had the arepa lunch special with soup and it was perfect on a cold day. The menu is quite large and they denote special items like Gluten Free and Vegetarian for each dish. My father had the cubano and cleaned his whole plate deeming it \"tasty\" - a high complement on his end! Clean and cozy with friendly service. We don't live in the area but look forward to coming back when we visit."}
{"text":"The cachapa dish is really flavorful and loaded with food. For $12 it is pretty pricey as far as Venezuelan goes, but they really deliver a tasty portion with the pork and cachapa.   Arepas are okay-- nothing spectacular. Slightly bland, but the corn cake itself is very crisp (which is a plus for me). Fillings of pork and cheese were generous, just nothing about the flavor really stood out.  Soups were pretty good, both the beef and chicken. Empanadas are really good though, and at $6.99 for two empanadas and a soup, the lunch special is the way to go.  Really a neat ethnic restaurant in Madison-- unpretentious: order at counter, no table service, but very friendly and helpful if you do not know what to order."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Everything was perfect: the food was delicious, the restaurant was clean & tidy, and the staff were beyond friendly! Not only did they explain what each dish was (which takes a lot of patience, especially since I'm not a Spanish native speaker) but they went above-and-beyond to try to make our experience memorable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone - it's been my best experience with Spanish restaurants and I'm sure it will be yours too."}
{"text":"Very authentic!! I love Colombian food and it is hard to come by in Wisconsin. I had the bandeja paisa and agua panela con limón. It felt like being back in Antioquia. :) I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I had never been here, but decided to give it a try based on Yelp reviews. Friendly and fast service, seemed like a family place.   Nice cafe style dining room was simple, yet inviting.  Had the pabello, which was I was told was the number one seller.  This entree was excellent.   Portion was quite large (but so am I and did not have much for lunch), but was well presented.   The beans were well seasoned, rice was perfect, the beef was some of the best I have had.  Topped with semi-sweet plantains:  better than formal desert.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Fast, Friendly service. We had the \"typical\" dinner dish - shredded beef was super good and the rice had a light but very flavorful taste. My first time with Venezuelan food will not be my last."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but this place was outstanding.  It was very accommodating for my vegetarian son, and I wanted to spend the night just to eat lunch here .....but had to continue our journey across the country."}
{"text":"I went for lunch. The arepas were delicious. The staff is super friendly and nice. The food is affordable and pretty authentic. They have really spruced up the place since Dimitris."}
{"text":"My friend had already eaten here. It was my first time.  A-mazing!!!!  One amazing just doesn't cut it.  It was AMAZING!    My friend had the special - fish patacon pisao.  It was a fish sandwich and the \"bread\" was fried plantains!!!!  He also got the altias de pollo.  The passion fruit sauce was so tasty and fresh.  I got an arepas with shredded chicken and black beans and pastelitos with chicken.  I could have eaten twenty of them.    I can't wait to go back.  Please go eat there so it stays open!!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Madison. Hands down. Their Plato Navideno was one of my favorite things about the holidays this year."}
{"text":"I am new around the area, and I had a craving for empanadas and found this place. I was only going to get an empanada with shredded chicken, but I ended up getting a Patacon pisao and an empanada. And the food was delicious!! This place is a must go!!"}
{"text":"Casual, welcoming, wonderful hosts. The food is exactly as described and made my visit to Madison well worth the trip. I ate here twice in two days. This is a true gem."}
{"text":"This place is great! Never ordered anything I didn't enjoy. If you're new to it, order an area lunch. It's inexpensive, freshly made, and a lot of Food! Splurge on a glass of passion fruit juice. You will love it here."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was good and very tasty. I didn't care for the steak on my dish since it was very tough and I almost wished they had only added the pork belly and the chorizo sausage which was delicious and meaty.  I loved the little pastry pockets with the nutella inside but wished it had had more nutella in it and some of them were missing the filling altogether.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Driving back home to Chicago from the Dells we were not expecting to eat that great but we found this place online and it was amazing ! The Rompe Colchon appetizer was so fresh and unlike any other ceviche I have had before.  Being from South America myself I was happy to see so many familiar dishes and the flavored were on point.  Also ordered the Pabellon which was a good portion of food and the plantains were the plenty ! Next time in Madison we will for sure be stopping"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while now since seeing all the amazing yelp reviews so I was very excited when we finally came here for a late lunch on a Saturday.  The lady at the counter was extremely nice and when she noticed that we had been staring at the menu for 5+ minutes obviously having a hard time trying to decide what to order, she told us about their three most popular dishes (1. Pabelon 2. Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito 3. Bandejita Paisa) I got the Pabelon (it's the Venezuelan national dish, their most popular dish, and it comes with sweet plantains so I had to try it) and the person I was with got the Bandejita Paisa because of the sheer variety of food it comes with. Our food came out pretty quickly, the waiter originally brought out three arepa sandwiches to our table thinking they were for us, unfortunately they were not, but they smelled amazing and made us even hungrier for our food.  We both really enjoyed our food, the meat in the Pabelon was very tender and I don't normally like beans, but the combination of the meat with the beans and rice was great and I enjoyed using the arepa to make a mini sandwich out of my entree. I would definitely recommend getting a side of the green cilantro sauce because it is delicious and goes with everything. My friend really enjoyed the Bandejita Paisa, the steak was delicious and there was a ton of food. The weakest link on the plate was the chorizo but there were so many other delicious things that it didn't subtract from the experience at all.  It is extremely reasonable for the quantity of food that you get (easily two meals worth) and now that I know they have another location on E Johnson I will definitely be back very soon for an arepa sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing! It was so good, very casual feel. I ordered Bistec and my friend ordered some sort of corn pancake thing with pork chunks. It was so good. The prices were super reasonable especially for how much food you get, I'll be able to eat this for at least three meals. The staff was super helpful and very welcoming. An incredibly good experience. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Our first visit to La Taguara was a Hit.  We shared a beef and a  chicken filled empanada; a  black bean and a pork stuffed arepa; and fried plaintain appetizer.  Everything was delicious.  Ambiance is very casual, seating area is smallish but tables appear to turn quickly. Small parking lot but street parking nearby. Right across the street from the gardner bakery.  The staff was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the menu items to us.  We look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent people. We almost did not go in as we had had a bad experience at another local Latin American restaurant, but we are very glad we did. They were very warm and friendly and able to explain their menu if you haven't eaten Venezuelan food before. The food was great and very different from other Latin American food that we have had previously. We look forward to going back many times in the future to try all of their many options."}
{"text":"Wow! This was the best place I ate at during my week long stay in Madison. The young lady at the counter gave us some awesome recommendations. The food was so phenomenal. I didn't want to stop eating. I can't wait to visit again and fill my belly! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food, incredibly kind and helpful staff (let us sample the juices and taught us about the different dishes) - a total gem that we will always return to when coming through Madison. Honestly I'm surprised one of those food network type shows hasn't exposed this place yet! Everything is delicious and homemade, you really can't go wrong. I got the pabellon and it was just the right amount of food, the meat was seasoned impeccably. The plantains are perfect and so delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Delicious food that is different enough from most restaurants to be exotic, but tasty for most American tastebuds.  Latin American food is not just Chipotle burritos.  The restaurant is very clean and neat.The prices are extremely reasonable.  We will definitely come back many times."}
{"text":"From start to finish, our visit to La Taguara was incredible. Four coworkers and I went in for lunch without any knowledge of Venezuelan cuisine and the host (who may be the owner) patiently, cheerfully, and thoroughly explained the entire menu to us without being asked, as well as offered some suggestions.  We ordered the Tajadas con Queso for an appetizer - these are fried plantain slices with shredded white cheese. They were outstanding; it was noted that they tasted similar to grilled cheese with a hint of sweetness.  Adjectives that come to mind when describing our meals: amazing, outstanding, incredible, savory, satisfying, comforting... just downright delicious.  Our entrees for lunch included: chicken arepas (shredded chicken on a freshly fried corn masa bun), cachapa con queso y cochino frito (corn pancakes with cheese and fried pork), and the sopa y seco plate (ground beef, rice, salad, and lentil soup). Nothing we tried was anything less than outstanding. All the entrees were expertly seasoned and cooked. The salads were fresh, the soup was homemade, and there were no leftovers after our meal.  We plan to order in for our next company lunch, and I am seriously considering picking up lunch there tomorrow. It's that good and I would highly recommend it. The food was just outstanding and the service was equally stellar. As an aside, the decor was bright and welcoming - but seriously, try La Taguara. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner a couple of times before and was blown away at the quality of the food. Fresh ingredients full of flavor and a variety of dishes to try. But I just came here for breakfast for the first time and all I can say is WOW.  I ordered the \"typical Venezuelan breakfast\" Desayuno Criollo) although they do offer their full menu during breakfast time as well) and it surpassed my expectations (which I didn't think possible because everything I've had here is amazing). Deliciously seasoned shredded beef and black beans topped with the perfect amount of shredded cheese, avocado slices and a fried egg all blended beautifully on my plate with a little container of crema in the center to dollop where I pleased.  I cleaned my plate and don't feel weighed down or in a food coma.  It was perfect.  I can't forget to mention the delicious passion fruit juice I had to accompany my breakfast. From what I understand, they make their juices themselves - and this stuff will make you never want to have orange juice with breakfast again. :) Please come here and keep this place in business for a long time!"}
{"text":"Tried the traditional dish and it was so bomb. Plenty of food and fast service. Heard the owner turn down a skeezy salesman \"it's not just about the price, it's about the relationship I have with my current\"  I love everything about this place !"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday to meet an old friend that I studied abroad with in Latin America. I am fairly new to the Madison area and have been on a hunt for Latin American/Caribbean cuisine. We got there around 11:30 -- which was smart. I suggest arriving before 12:30 to avoid the huge lunch rush.  Overall, this place was outstanding.  I got the Patacon Pisao Lunch and stuffed my sandwich with black beans, eggplant, and white cheese. It was to die for. I also upgraded to the Shrimp (Camaron) and Coconut Salad which I highly recommend. Top it all off with a Modelo, and you are set. The variety of imported beers available was a huge plus.  Why not 5 stars? A few reasons. One, it was a bit pricey. Based on the location and decor, I was expecting the prices to match. Two, the sandwich was hard to eat. I had to deconstruct the whole thing and eat it with a fork -- which is fine -- but I would have preferred to eat it the traditional way. Finally, the wait was a bit long (although well worth it).  Overall -- a must-visit. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The arepas and sauce was very good. We had the passion fruit pie which was excellent as well. What a treat!"}
{"text":"I've had a few things on the menu and it was all delicious. For what it's worth, I went to school down in Venezuela and found Taguara's food to be authentic. Any Venezuelan will appreciate the imported drink cooler."}
{"text":"Excellent real Venezuelan food. I say this as a Venezuelan native. I will be coming back for sure! Really enjoy the Pabellón and Mojo! Get the Parchita juice if you like like passion fruit, it is delicious here.   Very welcoming, friendly staff."}
{"text":"When I was working in Madison I used to come here regularly for lunch. Amazing food and authentic Venezuelan all the way. In addition, Venezuelan is somewhat similar to Brazilian food so it brings me back to my roots. Give yourself a break of the ordinary chains and come for a much better food for about the same price. They serve very fast too."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty food, and very pleasant staff. I would drive from Milwaukee to come here any time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Consistently delicious and authentic food. I always order the tajadas con queso and the cachapa con queso y cochino frito. Yum. Service is always friendly too, and if you have any questions about the menu, the staff are happy to answer them."}
{"text":"This place is great. I highly recommend the cubano sandwich. The pork is tender and the crispy panini bread is perfect. I'm not a big fan of their soups however. Pretty fair pricing for the amount of food you get (their lunch specials are especially cheap). One of my favorite lunch spots. The staff are also really nice"}
{"text":"Just visiting Madison on a business trip, but this place made me want to stay. The gentleman (who I'm assuming is the owner) was extremely helpful in explaining the menu and making suggestions. He was also very encouraging at my attempts at spanish (it has been a few years!) and invited me to come back to practice. The food was absolutely delicious. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu. I had the tostones (fried plantain chips) and the Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito, which was a giant corn pancake stuffed with cheese and served with the most crispy delicate pork. I also had the tamarind juice which was refreshing and not overly sweet. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! This is the second time I've eaten at La Taguara this week. Today my husband and I went early to get a quick snack before heading out of town. We ordered the sweet plantains and the arepa with chicken and loved them both. The restaurant is clean, employees are very friendly (and make helpful recommendations) and our food arrived quickly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"La Taguara is a great authentic Venezuelan and Colombia cousin! It has a great atmosphere and ambience! The service is nice and helpful and the food is fresh with great authentic flavor! I love all there Verity of arepas!! I Also like how they have many great drinks form these South American Regions!"}
{"text":"Tried the mojito la coco which is a coconut fish curry. Amazing. Yucca fries were good too."}
{"text":"Terrific!  We had three entres (I remember two of them) Pabellon & Bandejita Paisa and a couple of appetizers on a family dinner.  The food was great and the staff was incredibly helpful directing us to options to get us started on our first visit to a Venezuelan restaurant.  The place was clean and bright, they clearly take pride in their business.  I'm glad to spend my money here, and we'll be back.  Can't wait to try the fish!"}
{"text":"The people that work there are very friendly and we're more than happy to explain what was good on the menu. The food was fantastic and the juice was amazing. Even though the place is small, definitely a gem in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Enthusiastic staff. They have a great thing going on. We WILL be back! Ask questions if you are not familiar with menu items. They are over the moon to explain the menu if it's not clear. They have BEER too. Simple seating, clean and yummy! Give it a try but DO ask questions.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso!  Highly recommend the pabellon and the sweet corn pancakes filled with cheese.  Best meal we've had in Madison!"}
{"text":"Unassuming on the outside, amazing food inside. I had the \"Venezuelan National Dish\" with the egg on top and it was delicious. The beef in there is something I'll be thinking about for a while. Others in my group had the empanada and Cuban sandwich. Both were fantastic. The passion fruit pie is very fresh, light, and tasty.  This has got to be some of the best food in Madison. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and they're willing to explain all of the dishes to any newcomers.   Don't even think about it - just try this place out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Delicious Venezuelan food! My bf and I ordered the Bandeja Paisa, Tostones and the Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito.  Service was great. The staff helped us with our orders and made sure it was to our liking. We didn't have room for dessert, but we'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"The best! Very tasty Latin American mostly Venezuelan.  Hidden gem in Madison, WI. Small place great service. The people here are proud of their heritage and express it through sharing their food in a superb way. Everything here is great and tastes like homemade."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison. Delicious Venezuelan food, friendly staff, good prices, large portions. I had the patacon pisao, which is a tostones sandwich with shredded beef, both unique and very yummy!"}
{"text":"great El Patacon Pisao! Unique cuisine, great service!"}
{"text":"Just try it! Was not sure what to expect but tried it due to the all the positive reviews. Was not sure what to order but very friendly lady at the counter helped us pick some stuff out and it was all delicious. Cubano sandwich is to die for."}
{"text":"So the food is good, but the service is absolutely horrible. I called this evening to place a pick-up order. Usually when someone is placing a pick-up order, they already know what they want. I sure did.   Anyhow, some lady answers the phone & I say I'd like to place a pick-up order. Mind you, I'm about 15 miles away on US 151, by mile marker 108, planning to arrive in time for the order to be ready. The lady asks me to hold, sets the phone down, & for the next 5 minutes, I hear the sound of the kitchen, & muffled speaking in the background. Then I hear the call taker greeting a customer.   She proceeds to basically read the entire menu to a customer, giving descriptions of each dish as she does. Most folks would have hung up, & eventually I did after 10 minutes. Finally, around the 12 minute mark, she picks up the phone. The phone had still been off the hook for 2 more minutes.   By the time I actually got ahold of her again, I was by E. Washington & Lien. I tell her how I waited for so long, hearing her read the menu. She tells me she is very busy, she is sorry, & she is the only person in the restaurant. Apparently, so busy, she couldn't take a one-and-a-half minute phone order, which could have been ready by the time I got there... but apparently not so that busy, as she had time to read & explain the entire menu to an in-store customer?   I don't need your lame excuses for piss poor service. You lost business tonight & from me, forever. I will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"What a find!  Stopped by on road trip from Atl. to Mpls. Great arapas.  And soup too."}
{"text":"We love to grab mid-five meal here on our way to Chicago. Really a cute, friendly place with Venezuelan did you cannot find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Authentic, house-made, fresh food. Great service, excellent food! One of my favorite places in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"It was 9:47 pm on a Saturday night and I regret to say that I only tried the beef and chicken empanadas, not that they weren't offering everything, they were, I just couldn't decide.  The empanadas were made with masa de maíz, a corn dough that was crunchy to the bite yet fluffy not to crush the delicacies it contains.  You can't go wrong with either, the shredded chicken and beef were rich and flavorful. Try dipping them in the guasacaca, a puree of cilantro and garlic based tastiness!   I will definitely return to try some of their other entree menu items."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town. The entrees are delicious and affordable-- I especially like the coconut fish. The service is great. And the churros are good too. :)"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim.  We were originally going to another restaurant, but there happened to be a snow storm and La Taguara was a lot closer.  So happy fate brought us here.  Food was delicious.  My picky two year old loved her food.  She got the hot dog, which doesn't seem like anything extraordinary, but they shaped the hot dogs like little octopus.  We got the pabellon and bistec encebollado.  Both were delicious!  A lot of food for the price.  For dessert we got tequenos de guayaba y queso and dulcellitos & nutellitos..AMAZING!    Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here hungry after a day at devil's lake. The Pabellon plate was perfect. Even the beans were tasty! We indulged in the sampler appetizer, all of the pieces were piping hot and delicious. Not your typical deep fried appetizers you'd see at a restaurant. The breading was amazing.   I cannot tell you how I've been craving some plantains like the ones that came with the Pabellon; moist on the inside with a caramelized outside. Yummy!!   They were very busy but the food came out fast, fresh, and was hot. Many people were smart and called ahead for pick up. The passion fruit juice was sweet and I enjoyed a glass of it with my meal."}
{"text":"My first experience with Venezuelan food and definitely not my last! The food here is extremely flavorful, unique and reasonably priced and served fast for the great quality. The service was excellent and was able to explain the menu so it was easy to understand the (many) options. Very casual atmosphere with a bit of the native flare. I highly recommend stopping by and trying out the food for there or take out, there seems to be something for everyone! The portions are large so be prepared to take some home for later. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I got walked in as a newbie and said \"hit me with what you think I should get\". The lady at the counter was very nice and recommended the Pabellon dish as its a Venezuela national treasure. I added an empanada for good measure and couldn't be happier. The plantains taste just like the ones I would eat in Miami."}
{"text":"4.5 stars   Empanadas: a Brief history. Everyone has a version of a savory filling wrapped in dough. Madison has pasties (or pasty). Italy has calzones. China has baos. They vary based on stuffing, flour, and cooking method. I'm from Oklahoma and knew the \"empanada\" way before the others. SO I'll stick with empanadas come from \"South of the Border.\" Even at that Venezuela is different from Argentina, from Bolivia, from Colombia. Anyway, I'm not an official empanada connoisseur, but throughout my life, I've discovered I LOVE corn flour AND deep fried (vs baked). So La Taguara arrived in my life, and I knew I had to try the Empanadas (and Arepas).  Chicken Empanada - Fabulous. Basic shredded chicken, stewed in seasonings (garlic, green pepper, onion, paprika, seasoning salt), not spicy, still juicy. Nothing else in it. Fried. The breading has a slight brown crunch on the outside and soft white chew on the inside. This rivals Miami, but it's in Madison! 5 stars  Arepas - a finely ground corn flour (much more than corn tortilla type flour), is like a chewy, puffy thick round tortilla (think 5 layers together), but is known as \"bread,\" and cut in half to fill it with a protein. I've had a Costa Rican version, Pupusa made of Masa flour (smaller and more dense). There is a difference. Venezuelan arepas are lighter and more airy, but they don't handle the cut as well.  Reina (arepa) - arepa filled with chicken salad, potatoes, mayo and avocado. This is a Venezuelan specialty. It's good, but every place I've ever ordered it, they use dark chicken and it just overpowers the delicate avocado and mayo. Thankfully, La Taguara has this AMAZING sauce, guasacaca = garlic + avocado + vinegar. 3/5  Pabellon (arepa) - traditional is filled with shredded beef, plantain, black beans, and cheese. I asked for chicken without cheese. Unfortunately, I was GIVEN beef. I was excited to try salty and sweet, but I had to toss the beef. It was bland without the salty protein. 2/5  Pepito de Pollo - Chicken Sandwich is how it's framed. What a surprise! It reminds me of a mustard-style chicken chili (tangy, tart; not tomato based) on a soft french roll. They pile on onions, green peppers, bacon, lettuce, tomato, 5 sauces! and onion strings! (I held the cheese.) This is a Venezuelan chili. Southerners pour gravy over everything, Texans pour red chili over everything, and Wisco pours cheese over everything. So of course this made sense to me! It was so good. Comes with fries and \"pink sauce\" (ketchup + mayo), which is  Central/South America's version of ketchup. 5 stars  Space - small-medium. Fits about 5 tables of 4, and 3 tables of 2. The TVs flash pics of Venezuela, not sure if they can show games.  Overall, I LOVE this place. Good South/Central American style food (think everyone below Mexico). This is NOT Mexican food. Nothing spicy, nothing too fancy, just flavorful. La Taguara is a warm southern breeze in a cold beer state."}
{"text":"Had the pabellon. Enjoyed the layers of flavor.  Black beans were buttery smooth, yummy. Good service, cheery service.  I look forward to trying rest of menu."}
{"text":"La Taguara was recommended by a friend so I came here with my girlfriend for lunch.  It's a small restaurant but it's clean and well kept.  The staff was friendly and the service was helpful and genuine.  I had high expectations based on what my friend told me and they were definitely met.  The food was great, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the king fish, but was sadly disappointed that the fish came out very dry. My husband ordered the garlic shrimp and that was tastier than the fish. Also, I decided to have the Italian table wine and was surprised that it was chilled - it very sweet and bit carbonated as well - tasted more like carbonated sangria."}
{"text":"Went to LA Taguara on a Sunday afternoon looking for something different to eat. The place was clean and pleasant looking, the staff was right there to walk first timers through the menu! Yes the food was different, my son likes to drink South American soda's and the two he tried were very good!! We had a nice variety of food and are eager to come back and sample some more."}
{"text":"We dropped in on our way through madison. I've lived in a number of large east coast cities, and always found it tough to find truly good arepas, so when we passed this place I knew I had to try it. La Taguara did not disappoint. The arepas were a perfect consistency and the fillings all very tasty. Great place for a quick, inexpensive and delectable lunch."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. My wife and I came here because we wanted to try something new. A few small things contributed to the 4 star rating. The wait took quite a while, and I thought the prices seemed a little high considering the casual ambiance. No complaints about the food."}
{"text":"I randomly drove by this place and had to check it out. When my friend and I arrived, one of the owners took his time answering all of our questions, as we wanted to make the best out of our first time. He was patient and detailed and super friendly.  We ordered an arepa, which we enjoyed as it was yummy and not greasy and oily. We also had the bandejita paisa, which was a great idea for a variety of choices. A lot of different flavors in one dish--awesome And the homemade spicy salsa was AMAZING.   The owner even took time to talk about his culture, his history and background for opening the shop, and was just very welcoming all around. I felt like I was invited into his home and not just another restaurant. He even ran to the counter to say bye to us when we left. I loved it!  I work just down the street, so definitely going back with my colleagues!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Yuca frito and arepas make a perfect meal. Very authentic, great service, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited on the behest of a coworker who raves about the food. I was intrigued with the  mojito en coco. It's made with tilapia. The worst fish ever. However the cashier convinced me that it was the best fish for this dish and how great it was....BOY WAS SHE WRONG!  never again! It looked great but tasted like trash. My plantains were over cooked as well and the chicken I got as an appetizer was under seasoned.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We live in Chicago and frequently travel to Minnesota throughout the year. This small casual Latin American restaurant has turn into s must stop every time we travel. Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly, and food quality and authenticity are excellent.  This is must try if your are looking for a casual Latin American restaurant. If you are looking into a more fancy full served restaurant this is not your place."}
{"text":"Located along East Washington, almost by the East Towne Mall, lies this unassuming little shop in the strip mall. Sadly, it was very quiet when we visited for weekend dinner. However, this might be a great place for large group outings, as we did with 8 people. Also, you can make reservations ahead of time. Cheap food, large and spacious, delicious tidings - great for a large gathering! Also, they have parking in the strip mall, so no worries about parking!  There is no waiter service and seems more like a take-out style manner; you head to the counter and make your order, and head back there to collect your food when it's ready.   Food: Fried plaintains - very good and savory. Fried yucca - not my favorite. It was kind of fibrous... Bandeja Paisa - had several kinds of pork. As a pork lover, this is obviously my choice. I loved the fried pork belly! But the rest of the meat selection was kind of dry. Large enough to share with my boyfriend! Papelon con Limon - delicious drink to go with the meal. Sweet and sour sugarcane drink! Ducellitos and Nutellitos - these cute little empanadas are awesome for dessert. one per mouth and off they go!   La Taguara is a little far for me, but I will venture out to the far East to grab me some Ducellitos and Nutellitos. P.S., I tried some of my friend's #1 dish. It was awesome!! (was doubtful of the beans, but it's actually really tasty!)"}
{"text":"I ate here when I was in town for business.  So glad I found this place!  I had pabellon a caballo, and it was delicious. Generous portions too.  Would recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and all I can say is WOW!!   The food was fantastic and the prices are more then reasonable.     I would say this is my favorite restaurant I have eaten at!   The staff is super friendly and the food is made fresh right in front of you.  If you are looking for the hidden gem, here is what you are looking for.     I wish this place was near Fond Du Lac!"}
{"text":"The food was all delicious! Pabellon, the fried cheese appetizer, passion fruit pie, all of it so so good. We've been traveling and I was sick of spending $ to eat out but this was definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"I got the Pabellon a caballo and my dinner companion the Mojito en Coco.  Both were excellent!  Service was great, atmosphere nice, can't wait to try other menu items the next time I go.  So much food I even brought some home."}
{"text":"Returned for a repeat meal. Surprises... Place was packed, still spotless, very helpful staff, food was exactly as we had remembered it. It is rare that food quality remains the same over time. I was thrilled to see such a diverse group of diners.  Treat yourself to a little something different."}
{"text":"For the past five years I've been living in a Latin neighborhood in Brooklyn.  Coming back to Wisconsin, I missed walking a few blocks to my favorite Venezuelan restaurant.  Also ... public transportation.  Anyhow, I was cautiously hopeful when I read there is a good arepa in Madison.    After a long drive down East Washington--longer because I drove past it for an embarrassing distance--I discovered the austere yet homey interior of  La Taguara.  (Note it is after the \"Access\" sign and before the big steak house.)  You order at the little window with the smiling people.  The arepas are \"build your own\" with many fillings to choose from.  I chose black beans, white cheese, and shredded eggplant.    A little wait at a clean table under fluorescent lights, and another smiling person delivered my neatly packaged corn sandwich.  It was love at first sight.  The corn patty was thin and tender, with a crisp exterior.  The black beans were bursting with flavor.  The cheese was chewy and fresh.  And the eggplant had a bright taste and added the intriguing consistency of shredded beef, just without the ... um, beef.    It was all thoroughly wonderful and magical.  That was my only order, but I am already won over.  I will definitely return to order the holy trinity: plantains, rice, and beans.  My only teeeeny regret is there is no option of avocado for the filling.  But that was a damn good sandwich, and now in the early hours of the morning I am already craving another.  I hope they prosper and are able to expand to a more central location with later hours (please higher beings)."}
{"text":"La Taguara is nothing short of FANTASTIC!  I am hoping that the people of Madison are realizing what an amazing gem they have here and hope they appreciate it.  The prices are reasonable, the food is flavorful and the menu has an array of options. Service was informative, helpful with a very friendly smile and personality.   The Yuca fries (frita) appetizer was amazing! Better than any yuca I've had anywhere else before, including Chicago.  I had for lunch the arepa stuffed with white cheese, eggplant and shredded beef. The arepa is made of corn so it is gluten free and  it had this moist softness reminiscent of a steamed bun. Also I had a side of black beam soup an salad with a passion fruit dressing that was citrusy and refreshing.  Please sample the tamarindo juice! It is a little tart and a little sweet - very nice drink.  Next time I am anywhere near Madison I will be looking this place up!!!  Wow!  (They also haw a cooler full of beers)"}
{"text":"The pabellon arepa is the way to go.  It is great without the guasacasa sauce, and becomes fantastic with it.  The pabellon entree is good, but if you get the pabellon arepa, you get all the same stuff inside!  The pork arepa was OK.  The gausacasa sauce really improved it.  The yucca fries were unique.  They were crunchy on the outside, and pasty inside.  If you like fruit, I definitely recommend the passion fruit juice.  The tamarindo juice is also very tasty.  The sugar cane with lime juice was just OK."}
{"text":"Worth every penny. Menu options were not Americanized at all. Fresh,delicious authentic Venezuelan food. Get the appetizer sampler platter. The shredded pork dish with the egg on top was great. Passion fruit pie and rice pudding were a great way to end the meal. Woman who owns it was so sweet and accommodating to some of our picky eater requests too.  This is not a fancy place though, so be prepared to wait in line to order and get your own fountain soda from the machine."}
{"text":"Awesome! I tried at taste of Madison, best food! Gluten free options allows me to enjoy a few carbs lol"}
{"text":"What a fun place! Pretty sure the owner was the friendly and helpful person at the counter. We had zero idea what the menu items were, she was great at helping us navigate what each item was, plus small sample of the home drinks (cane sugar) so we could choose which one. Our salads were delish and very unique right down to the dressings. The entire establishment was extremely clean right down to the bathrooms. Thanks Yelpers for a great new experience would have never known this place existed without you."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Venezuelan? food and I can say it was quite amazing. I can't remember what it was called, but the person at the counter had recommended  it saying it was their third most  popular plate. It came with a good balance of different meats (sausage, fried pork, and beef), beans, rice, avocado, plantains, egg, and a cornbread-like pancake. I felt like it was a hearty meal and mixed together perfectly. The flavors weren't too overwhelming with sweetness or saltiness. If you ask for spice then have a strong sauce for you. It was also a great portion size. I would come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've visited La Taguara a couple times.  It's in one of the locations that I tend to forget that it is there. There have been several businesses in and out of this location - but I hope La Taguara is here to stay.  The owner is so nice and friendly. He gives recommendations if you've never had Venezuelan food before.  The different dipping sauces are super tasty.  The two different meals that I have tried there, I thoroughly enjoyed. You get pretty hefty portions of food. A fun local establishment."}
{"text":"First visit here, food was delicious, ample portions and not too expensive. Friendly staff, and quick service. Not a large dining area, but still comfortable. You order at the counter and they bring it to you. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Stop in for lunch since I was nearby and walked out stomach happy. My best empanadas so far. Ordered from the lunch menu, 1 beef and 1 chicken. I love the pastry on the empanadas- slightly crispy on the outside, once you bite through, you get the ingredients (shredded chicken or ground beef) without tasting the dough. Very nicely done. The soup of the day I had was noodles and tomatoes. Very clean taste and not salty. I liked it.   Another observation was the clientele. There were people of all ethnicities; a true American joint serving Venezuela food!  Overall, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's an unpresuming building with a small parking lot. Upon entering the restaurant we saw about a dozen and half tables with maybe a dozen patrons. We grabbed a couple of menus from the counter and pushed together a couple of tables to accommodate our group of six. While we were waiting for the rest of our group, the cashier came by and asked if we'd been there before. We said no, and he mentioned some of the menu highlights for us to think about while we were waiting. When the rest of our group arrived, he returned and did a wonderful job of describing some of the high-lights from each portion of the menu (appetizers, entrees, and sandwiches). He let us know to go to the counter to order.  The menu consists of a variety of appetizers, entrees, and sandwiches from Venezuela and Latin America. Many of these were things I had never encountered before. Our group started with the El Papi Venezolano which includes Cheese masa balls, yucca sticks, ground beef mini empanadas and tequenos served with three sauces as well as the Rompe Colchon which was Shrimp marinated in lime juice, tossed with fresh tomatoes, avocados, onions, cilantro and plantain chips. I loved the empanadas; the filling was delicious! The tequenos are breadsticks filled with a sweet cheese and were amazing. The masa balls and yucca sticks were a bit starchy for me, but dipped in the garlic and cilantro sauce or the green onion sauce were quite good. The marinated shrimp dish was also amazing. My only complaint would be that many of the plantain chips were too small too hold anything.  For entrees our group had the Pabellon, Cachapa Con Queso y Cochino Frito, and the La Taguara Burger Sandwich. The Pabellon is the national dish of Venezuela and consists of black beans, shredded beef, rice and deep fried sweet plantains and an arepa. The beef was incredible. The rest was a bit bland for my taste, but mixed with the beef and some of the leftover sauce was the appetizers was very tasty. Everyone also enjoyed the Cachapa Con Queso y Cochino Frito which was a sweet corn pancake filled with cheese and accompanied with crispy pork. The portion sizes were large and are an excellent value. For dessert we had churros which were light and sweet but with a denser filling then I'm used to. They came with two dipping sauces.  It was great a treat to try a bunch of unique foods which we weren't used to. And the service from the cashier was truly outstanding. This is definitely a gem worth trying."}
{"text":"I'd never had Venezuelan food until recently, and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. The dishes here have some interesting, unique flavors and the staff is very helpful and informative when it comes to choosing something off the menu. To start I ordered the tostones, which are fried plantains served with a guasacaca sauce. The guasacaca sauce is awesome, I love the garlicky flavor. My entrée was the  Bandeja Paisa dish since it seems to be one of the more popular choices. It consists of steak,  pork belly,  chorizo, sunny side up egg, plantain and rice, pinto beans and avocado. It's also served with this little fried corn masa; that was one of my favorite components of the dish. On my next visit I had an arepa stuffed with pernil, a pork roast, that was very satisfying. I also ordered a lemonade the first time I went but was given a tamarind juice. I didn't say anything only because I ended up really liking the tamarind flavor. I would like to go here during the lunch specials as the prices seem very decent."}
{"text":"Best Venezuelan food I have tried in a while.  A lot of different things on the menu to try even if you are a vegetarian. The service is good and the owner was there very friendly! I'll go back soon"}
{"text":"Amazing. I've been to a lot of good Venezuelan places across the U.S., from LA to Miami, but this is the best -- the menu is big, everything is great, and the owners are lovely.    If you've never had Venezuelan food and are dubious, fret not - they have some American food. But if you like Cuban, Colombian, or other carribbean - influenced food, you'll love it.  Go full criollo!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way to east side from far west side and it was totally worth it. Five of us tried different entrees and we loved them all. The arapas were specially moist and delicious!! Love the customer service. The owner took his time to explain to us every dish on the menu. The service was prompt. Will definitely visit again. Loved it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went back and had the bistec encebollado. Super delicious. Loved the beans and rice most of all. I still really liked the passion fruit dressing as well. It would be appreciated if they organized a wait staff. I'm not too fond of the \"ordering at the counter\" method and helping yourself to everything. I like to enjoy my dinner and not having to get up several times to get things that I forget I need (utensils, napkins, refills, etc.)"}
{"text":"Menu is heavy on starchy fried foods. Very limited in vegetarian/ vegan options.  Ambiance/decor: cheap, tacky. Got a rickety tiny table that shook throughout.  Dampened our dinner experience.  We had the Arepas - very thick chewy glutinous sandwich which was difficult to cut and eat. Beef empanadas were better although the filling was too little compared to the amount of crust. Pabellon or the National dish was best.  Yucca fries were very dry and bland tasting  The accompanying guasacaca or avocado sauce was very good. Added a bit of zing to the overall mediocre dinner.  Don't ask for the hot sauce - big rip off. Barely a teaspoon of sauce in a tiny container for an additional 50 cents + tax +tip. For that minuscule amount, it should be free."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised of finding authentic Latin American food here! The flavors and presentation was on point. Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I was so excited to discover this order-at-the-counter Venezuelan restaurant on East Washington near First Street. I have really fond memories of eating Patacon Pisao at a place in Queens, NY (it was so delicious that if I happened to be in the neighborhood, I'd have to talk myself out of coming back more than once a day).   At 5:45pm on a weekday, La Taguara was pretty empty.  I ordered my favorite, the above mentioned Patacon Pisao for $7.99. The man at the counter was very accommodating and let me mix beans with chicken as the protein in the sandwich for no extra cost. The sandwich, which came out super-fast, was unwieldy. So much so that I couldn't even eat it as a sandwich and had to take a knife and fork to it. Not only was it sloppy, but the lettuce was wilted, and there was too much mayo. Overall, pretty disappointing.   My dining mate got the Pabellon entrée for $12.99 and was happy with it (plus it came with a beautiful chopped salad).   I'd love to get an amazing Patacon Pisao in Madison, but La Taguara won't be that place (which is perhaps better for my waistline)."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to their Cubano sandwich a few weeks ago and we've been there about three 3 times since to take the food home. The bread is toasted just right. The pork is tender and has a lot of flavor. The simple mustard and pickle topping goes a long way and complements the meats well. The guasacaca sauce is delicious and I have no problem dipping into my wife's in between bites. The plantain chips are not bad. They're not greasy and very crispy. We're planning to try other stuff on their menu but we might get derailed and continue ordering the Cubano for a while."}
{"text":"This is real authentic Venezuelan food! Me and my wife are from South America and were very happy to have found this place. We were completely amazed by the food. I had the bandeijta paisa, it came with carne asada, pork cracklings, sausage, black beans, avocado, fried egg. It tasted incredible, the pork cracklings were my favorite. My wife had the cachapa con queso and cochino frito. The cheese in the cachapa was delicious as was the fried pork! The guasacaca sauce was amazing. For dessert we had the churros with dulce de leche sauce, they were a little too crispy for our taste but they were very tasty nonetheless. We will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"4.75 stars, really.   The empanadas and plantain dishes took me back in time to my grandmother's kitchen in Caracas. Nowhere else in Madison have I had such authentic Venezuelan food. Only complaint would be that it's just a little pricy for what you get on some menu items, but nothing I don't mind paying for the taste and nostalgia value. I'm also sure they have to import a fair amount of things, I'd still rather come here for a few arepas instead of throwing down $8-$13 for a burrito or sandwich anywhere else.   Small talk in Spanish with anyone I've ever encountered working the counter is also a unique experience, nothing but good things to say about the staff.  Recommend this one for sure."}
{"text":"It's possible that the food is good here, but I wouldn't know. Showed up at 20 minutes to close with my family - the tables and chairs were up already and they would only serve to go food. Seems to me like you should serve until you close. That's why you post hours. If you want to stop serving a half hour earlier, then change your hours."}
{"text":"Just wanted to grab something quick and light and this place totally drew us in. The staff was quick and helpful when we had questions. We had a rompe colchon, a cold shrimp and avocado dish with crispy fried plantains, and it was delicious! The appetizer was enough for a meal. Loved it. I will definitely be back next time I am in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It's very casual, just a few tables in the place, more of a take-out type place. Really good variety, authentic food and everything is good!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to La Taguara after having my first arepa at Taste of Madison. I'm not sure why I waited so long to go back. The staff is incredibly friendly and very willing to go through the entire menu to explain the dishes they offer and make suggestions. I think that is a fine quality that is lost on most people and restaurants today, taking time to please the customers. I will continue to dine here because they overall experience is top notch. Excellent food, service, and experience!"}
{"text":"I finally came here on a Wednesday evening after getting lot of recommendations. It has a beautiful Venezuelan decoration inside. It was clean and the cashier/server was friendly. The foood!! So so good!! You got to eat here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I am visiting from Chicago, I've been disappointed in Madison's food until I came here. I wanted to order everything on the menu! I had the Bistec Encebollado and I wish my stomach was big enough to eat it all."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp before, but I literally made an account so I could write about La Taguara. This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Madison. Having lived here for 5+ years, I've tried many of the amazing places this city has to offer, but nothing compares to La Taguara. The food is incredible, unique and authentic. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgable about everything on the menu. Don't let the simple exterior fool you; give it a shot, and once you do, I know you'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place purely due to its great reviews on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. My son and I were both very happy with our decision in doing so. I had the \"signature\" Pabellon with shredded beef, beans, rice, and plantains. It was delicious and ample in portion size. My son enjoyed the Bandejita Paisa which too was delicious, but neither of us was enamored with the chorizo sausage. The fried pork belly was the highlight of both plates, but both meals were great. We're both pleased that we now have a spot we can both rely on should we not be able to decide where to dine when I visit him in Madison. If you haven't tried this place yet, please do so and help support a great family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something just a little different when we were in Madison, so I found this place.  Interior is cozy and bright.  I ordered the Pabellon a Caballo and my husband had the Bandjita Paisa (I included descriptions in the photos I posted).  Both plates were heaped with meat, black beans and some very well-seasoned rice, topped with a sunny-side up fried egg.  There was a lot of flavor in the meats, the prices are reasonable and the portions were extremely generous!  I can't imagine ANYONE leaving hungry when eating here!  My husband can eat hearty portions of food and he left full!  Definitely recommend this place when going to Madison!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that I really want to like as it fits my style of casual eating. I was brought here by a Venezuelan friend, but, unfortunately I really didn't think the food was good. Perhaps I don't like the cuisine, but I really thought there were many flaws.  I had a dish that had a bit of everything, since that's what my friend recommended. The main protein was beef. It was sooooo overcooked. I understand that's how they traditionally cook it, but it really destroys a nice cut of meat. The portion was large, but it was mostly rice and beans. The whole thing was also really greasy. My wife was also unhappy about her meal.  Again, I wish I could say better things, but La Taguara was not for me."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I definitely would. Food made fresh, prices are super reasonable and portions are huge!!! Vegetarian, Gluten-free and Paleo options available. We started with Yuca con chicharrón (gf/df) as our appetizer which was awesome! I had the Patacón Pisao de pernil (think \"jibarito\"- its gf and there's the vegetarian option as well). Its like a sandwich but buns are actually plantains and it was very flavorful. I especially love the guasacaca sauce (garlic & cilantro). My husband had the Churrasco Criollo (gf & df) which consisted of steak, chorizo, yuca and picadillo and it amazing! I definitely recommend you check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"My friends brought me here for lunch after kayaking and I thought it would be an excellent place to bring my friends when they visited Madison - it didn't disappoint! I've tried the arepas, yuca con chicharron (yuca fries with crispy pork belly- yes tastes as good as it sounds), and mortadella. They are all yummy. Their picadillo salad that comes with many dishes is very refreshing and flavorful. Both times I've been there, the guy behind the counter taking the orders was super friendly and helpful in explaining what the dishes were. Really good customer service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with the family. We all got arepas - pork and cheddar for me, chicken and white cheese for them. We all loved them! We also got the plantains with white cheese (tajdas con queso) as an appetizer, and they were delicious. Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came all the way from Milwaukee and I was not disappointed!!  The food was delicious and being from Latin America I can say it tastes just like home. The trip was worth it!! Will be definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I am Venezuelan and I am just visiting Madison from Miami. I stopped by to see if this was any original Venezuelan food and out of sheer curiosity and I can tell you this was delicious and fresh ! Very legit and big portions I was so happy to eat some of my home food in Wisconsin. 10 out of 10 will come back. Try the mojito which is fish done in a coconut sauce shredded up trust me you will be amazed at how delicious the is !"}
{"text":"I am writing this review in some pain from my extremely full belly.  Husband and I are supremely glad we stopped in--this place deserves all their accolades and more.  I rolled out the door. This food was absolutely fantastic.    The Bandejita Paisa is amazing.  The rice is spiced with a certain something (chicken stock? Something else?) and I couldn't stop eating it.  The beans are lovely.  The crispy pork is great.  The steak tasty.  The egg lovely (ah, molten yolk, YUM!  The only way to cook eggs, IMHO.)  I don't know how the chorizo tasted, because I traded it to my husband in return for his avocado and rice, but he ate everything on his plate too, so it must have been tasty.  If you still have room after you're done with your entrée, make sure you try the passion fruit pie.  Hubby did and I am glad he saved me a bite.    I want more La Taguara.  When are we coming back to Madison?"}
{"text":"Diet Mountain Dew and their Pico is amazing. We finished the large bowl we requested after sampling it with our appetiser. I am buying more to-g,o for later.  The right amount of lemon juice, fresh tomatoes, onions, etc."}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp! This place is highly rated for a reason. Sooooo good. When we drove up for brunch at 11 on a Saturday, we were the only ones there! The guy (owner?) walked us through the popular items on the menu and thanked us for coming. We got the desayuno criollo and perico. The beef in the crillo was so flavorful and the nata (Latin American sour cream) was really good with it- it's a lot richer than American sour cream. The guy also brought us guasacaca sauce even though we didn't order it (\"I want you to try this\"), and it MADE THE MEAL. I definitely recommend getting the sauce...with everything! The black beans were awesome and my husband described the seasoning on the eggs as \"four star.\" The place was clean, nice music, and fun decor on the walls. We will definitely be coming back to try their lunch and dinner entrees. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This little place is definitely a diamond in the rough.  It's hidden off of east Washington in a unassuming little building but it's definitely worth a visit!   We constantly crave the flavors of this place.  One of my favorites is the patacon Pisao sandwich is always my favorite and I love their ceviche.  This place is a must while in Madison!"}
{"text":"I came here based off of Yelp reviews. I was in town for the weekend and decided to try at least one delicious restaurant while I was here. Let me say they did not disappoint!!! I came here around 5pm on a Sunday. They close at 6pm on Sunday's. I ordered the Pabellon (Venezuelan National Dish with black beans, white cheese, shredded beef, rice, and deep fried sweet plantains, arepa, and topped with a sunny side up egg ). Fulfilling and scrumptious   For my appetizer I ordered the Alitas de Pollo (crispy chicken wings tossed in our home made passion fruit spicy sauce served with a side of nata). Sweet and spicy wings . For dessert Tequenos de Guayaba y Queso (Venezuelan version of cheese sticks filled with white cheese and guava).  Let me say that the portions were of a good size and you will be fulfilled with any entree that you purchase. The Pabellon was flavorful, not spicy, and seasoned to perfection. The shredded beef literally melted in your mouth, the plantains very sweet and crisp, and the rice and beans were not heavy but seasoned with love! The Alitas de Pollo were sweet and spicy and crisp and deep fried. You get about 10 wings per order or 1lb.   The dessert was tasty as well. Im glad I stopped in this place and decided to have dinner. Next time I'm in Madison I will definitely be back. Oooh before I forget. This is the only place that I've been that sells Guarana Brazil soda. I studied abroad in Brazil in college and literally drank this sofa every other day . This place deserves 5.5 star to be honest"}
{"text":"So delicious came here for lunch and I'm so full. I'd describe the food as a lighter, brighter more refreshing version of a Mexican style food. Nice and clean, friendly staff willing to help. Little bit on the pricey side but worth it."}
{"text":"We were visiting Madison and had the good fortune of discovering this place.  The atmosphere is comfortable (even for us gringos), the staff is friendly, the prices are fair, and the food is outstanding.  We ordered a number of arepas, along with soup, yucca, and a few other sides.  Every single dish was well done, perfectly cooked, great flavor, and paired with delicious dipping sauces.  It may also have been the best yucca I've ever had.  A great experience overall...even the kids loved it.  You won't regret stopping in."}
{"text":"If you've never had Venezuelan food, this place will make you a fan. If you like Cuban food, or Mexican food, you are in for a treat. We had a great experience at this clean, Eco-conscious place that has great, authentic, interesting, yummy Venezuelan food. Lots of gluten free options for my friend who had the Venezuelan national dish. I had tasty cochinitas fritas with corn pancakes. The yucas fritas was great, and the fresh passion fruit juice was perfect. The portions were generous, and the owner was on hand to make recommendations, answer questions, and make sure we had a great experience. The good food and friendliness reminded me if when I lived in Ecuador."}
{"text":"Our first weekend in Madison, we decided to try this restaurant. Yelp did not disappoint! It's a small place, the decor was cute. The staff was very friendly. We ordered beers (Peruvian, Spanish, and Nicaraguan), arepas (beans and cheese, eggplant and cheese), fried plantains (sweet and savory), cheese sticks with guava and Pabellon. The arepas were excellent and the fried plantain took me back to the Caribbean. My mom ordered the sugarcane lemonade (a must have if you're not drinking alcohol). The portions were big -perfect for sharing. We had some leftovers that tasted great the next day."}
{"text":"We have been looking for an authentic cuban sandwich in all of our US travels. Little did we know that there was one RIGHT HERE IN TOWN! The sandwich was delicious and the plantains were a nice crunch. The dipping sauces with our bolitas appetizer were all yummy. I think I have found my new favorite restaurant.   The woman at the counter (didn't catch her name, sorry) was very attentive and friendly. I am always paying attention to customer service and this place was TOP NOTCH. She even checked in with us and asked if the Cuban was in \"our top 10\". It is one of our favorites.  I heard they have a yummy breakfast on the weekends and I can't wait to go back and try something else delicious.  Fast, friendly, small, clean and inviting. Definitely go there!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL food! Flavorful, great portions, and friendly staff. The beef empanadas and #1 was the best. They were offering a Christmas special that looked amazing - I'll be back to try it!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and delicious. I'm a fan and will definitely be back. The menu has a range of options for carnivores and vegetarians. Vegans may have a harder time but it's workable. The arepas for lunch were terrific and I heard a customer at the neighboring table complimenting the salad dressing. You order at the counter and they will call your number when it's ready."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for the first time this evening. We decided we needed to try someplace neither of us had ever been and saw this was well-reviewed. The outside of the building is easy to miss, but inside it is clean and bright.  As it was our first trip, we took the helpful suggestions provided at the counter. We got tequenos (kind of like mozzarella sticks) to start. They were good and the green onion sauce was a hit with my husband.  For entrees we had the pabellon and cachapa con queso y cochino frito. The pabellon was good, shredded beef on a layer of perfectly cooked rice. The side of sweet plantains were wonderful as were the black beans. The cachapa was really fantastic though. The sweet, crispy corn pancake filled with cheese was amazing. The guasacaca (bright green cilantro sauce) was the best part, in my opinion.   We're looking forward to going again soon. I'll get my own papelon con limon (sugar cane juice) next time and definitely try out some other dishes.   Our total bill (2 large entrees, an appetizer, 2 beverages) was just shy of $40."}
{"text":"The food was great. We dined in.  The owner even came and explained the menu to us since we looked lost staring at all the items! We ordered 2 of the entrees the owner suggested and we enjoyed both of them."}
{"text":"Delicious!  My first experience with Venezuelan food.  Great service and lovely atmosphere in this small rather homey restaurant.  I loved the photos of Venezuela on video screens and the banners with pictures and information about Venezuela."}
{"text":"Spoiler alert: I'm obsessed with La Taguara's food now!  We stopped in after hearing a lot of excellent things about La Taguara.  First off, I was a little put off by the higher prices for items when you order at a counter and bus your own table.  However, after experiencing the food here, I think it's worth every penny.  This food is absolutely delicious!  The woman who took our order was very friendly, and willing to give us recommendations or answer any questions since it was our first time here.  We tried the tostones (fried plantains), the mojito en coco (a tilapia coconut curry dish served with plantains, rice, and pico), and the camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp with plantains, rice, and pico).  Everything came with this delicious avocado-based sauce, guasacaca, which I couldn't get enough of.  The pico was super fresh, the plantains were perfectly seasoned, and both the fish curry and shrimp were super tasty.  I couldn't get enough of it, but with the large portions and appetizer, we both had enough leftover for a big meal the following day.  I LOVE this place and now I want to try everything on the menu.  Madison has an abundance of Central American restaurants to try, so it was really cool to try something from Venezuela.  We also appreciated that the menu had some seafood and vegetarian dishes (or probably some that could be modified to be vegetarian pretty easily) to choose from as well."}
{"text":"Solid across the menu.  Calling ahead the order for takeout is a good strategy. Domino arepas are my favorite."}
{"text":"Traveling through town I happen upon this amazing place. Walked in and was promptly welcomed. Asking if I had been in before. After claiming this was the first and I was passing through was given a whole run down of the menu. Decided on the Pork Arepa and Soup of the day which was Chicken and Wild Rice. The pork in the Arepa was super flavorful and moist, while the \"bun\" was nice and crispy. Would love to live close and taste the whole menu, it looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  With kids away at camp, we were able to get out on a Friday night.  This place hit the spot.  A number of cars in the lots, but plenty of seating in the small dining area.  Walked right up to the cjnter and we like others were asked if ever been before.  the hostess then walked us through the menu.  We ordered their top dish, pabellon and a pabellon a caballo.  Anndd delicious.  Enjoyed with a Polar beer and as we were finishing up the place was nearly full.  A great casual meal.  We will return to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Highlight of my week.  What a great place with amazing and authentic food.  The people were helpful and patient as we ordered at the counter yet with the attention to detail of a waitstaff experience.  Empanadas, and  the featured item with the egg and beef and plantains were awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!! Amazing service!!! And super nice people!!! I am soooo happy to find a Venezuelan place like this one!!! Prices are good too!!! I love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Went last night on a friend's recommendation and it was outstanding. Beyond the extremely warm welcome and friendly service, I tried the Chacapa con Queso which was amazing! So many other interesting looking choices; I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been in Madison Wisconsin for 8 weeks. I am so sorry I didn't try this restaurant my first day. I had the best Cubano sandwich I've ever eaten. Miami has nothing on this little place. All the food I saw others eat looks equally tremendous. By the looks on their faces the food is.   This is a definite place to dine. I'll be eating here in August when I come back to check on my client."}
{"text":"Heaven in a fried corn dough bun. The only problem with this restaurant is deciding what to order because everything on the menu looks so freaking good.   My bf wanted to call in for takeout, and I was nervous that the delicious food wouldn't survive the 20-min ride home, but it DID and everything was still hot, crispy,  and amazing.   We got the papi venezolano, beef arepas and chicken arepas, and the parrilla callejera. Everything was perfect. The nata, guasacaca and tartara verde sauces are ridiculously good and excellently complement each of the appetizers.   I'mjust sad that we didn't eat in the restaurant and try some of the Venezuelan drinks and desserts, which also all look crazy good. La Taguara is one of my new favorites for sure."}
{"text":"Very pleasant. Enjoyed the friendly service. The food was very tasteful. Thank god for the Internet as we are novices to Venezuelan food we weren't sure what we were eating!! Excellent unique taste. Had a Mexican flavor to it. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. My favorite thing to get is an arepa con carne desmechada. Pricing is good and the food is filling and tasty. I used to get the bandeja paisa but now it doesn't come with steak anymore :( they make it with ground beef... I guess if you're ok with that then go for it but I haven't gotten anymore since they changed it. I did get a side order of chicharrón the other day and it was SO good! But really this place is good when you have a craving to eat arepas but don't want to make them. Lol...Also they play great music (salsa) so can't beat the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Que sabrosa! I can't believe it took me so long to get here! It's an unassuming place tucked off of East Wash over not the East Side. Small parking lot out front. Step inside and you are transported to Venezuela! The place feels like vacation. Sunny, bright with great music playing. The bright walls are spotted with Venezuelan tourist posters. You order at the counter, grab some silverware and sit where you like. The gal working the counter was super friendly and helpful as she helped as navigate the many choices.  The bf had the Pabellon (national dish) which consists of beans, shredded beef, plantains, cheese and an arepa. I had the Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito. A giant sweet corn pancake stuffed with delicious cheese and served with crispy pork (chunks of fried pork yumminess). Both are available vegetarian. Both were an excellent value and we both left with leftovers. I was a little worried how the cachapa would reheat but it was excellent. The dipping sauces were fantastic and clearly fresh. If you like a little kick, ask for the spicy one but use sparingly-they aren't messing around.  I'm a huge fan and I will be back. And that's saying something for this far west sider. Gracias La Taguara!"}
{"text":"Food was great, very good portions for the reasonable price, staff were very helpful and friendly in explaining food choices that were unfamiliar. Many gluten free/vegetarian options or variations. Its great to see cultural variety in dining options like this!"}
{"text":"This is an order at the counter restaurant.   The food is high quality and so are the drinks, which they make in-house (passion fruit juice, tamarindo, etc.)  Get the churros for dessert, which dulce de leche and chocolate sauce dipping.   Diddo on what others were raving about, too.   East Washington on this side of town needs more restaurants like this!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a month, and it is my top suggestions for folks when looking for a restaurant. I've tried at least half the menu, and have not been disappointed yet.  Yesterday, was looking for a quick lunch. Ended up with the arepa lunch - I chose to fill it with white cheese, chicken and black beans. A side of beef stew. Everything was fresh and delicious as always."}
{"text":"This is new favorite place for South American food in Madison.  Great prices, flavor and cooking.  If you like to find hidden gems then show them off, this is a great find.  The empanadas are crispy on the outside, piping hot and have a delicious avocado sauce.  Fried pork is crispy, and as savory as bacon.  A touch on the salty side, but not over bearing."}
{"text":"My daughter who lives in Madison has some friends from South America who really like La Taguara and she has been waiting to have a buddy to appreciate this one year old cafe. We were out shopping and found this opportunity last evening. The owner came to help us get a baby stroller in the door and from that moment with his charming explanations and descriptions of the menu items we were happy! The place is adorable: very nice decor and very clean. We zeroed in on a sandwich called Patacon Pisao which is crispy green plantain made into a sort of sandwich layer, tomato, onion, cheese, mayo but not too much, tartara verde and a great guasacaca sauce which seems to be avocado and cilantro. You get a filling of beans or meat and we chose a potato chicken salad.  We learned about 2 very important national dishes, the pabellon and the cachapa con queso y cochino frito.  We decided to split both the patacon pisao and the pabellon. Pabellon had shredded seasoned pork, black beans with a sort of queso fresco, and rice, and a patty of yuca.  The real treat was the sauteed plantains on the side. Our appetizer were some lightly fried yuca frita sticks which remind us of potatoes but are light, served with the guasacaca sauce and picadillo salad. I had a Venezuelan frescolita which is like a reddish cream soda. I really really really like a place that uses real plates and real silverware. All the staff working there were helpful and welcoming. The portions were so big we brought half of the meals home with us. This is now my daughter's favorite place! We were also thrilled to see that the Central Park music event alternates food from La Taguara with another vendor too. I agree with Matt W that the food is soul food prepared by people who really care about the quality and presentation. I have loved Madison from the get-go when I first came here since 2006 but I always say that there are new features to this city all the time and you can get anything here you can get in LA for unique and fun things to do and eat. I invited La Taguara to come to LA so I can enjoy their dishes often!!"}
{"text":"Great shredded beef dishes! Fast service, good for take out, excellent price to quantity ratio."}
{"text":"This might be my second review on LT.  I can't remember, as I am still in an empanada and arepa induced haze.  I came here early for dinner on a weeknight and had only one minor complaint, which I will get to shortly.  I ordered an empanada and an arepa as well as a some fried plantains and they were heavenly.  Not heavenly like really good, but heavenly like I left the place and had to pull into a nearby tech school parking lot, recline, and rejoice in what just happened.  The taste was amazing.  Just amazing.  The fresh cilantro salsa with the plantains was awesome.  I actually preferred the smaller items to a previous meal I had with a more traditional dinner plate.  I took a few pictures and yelped them, but I was so overwhelmed by the awesome taste I could only label them \"Appetizer\" and \"Dinner\" and have just now recovered from this taste bud induced awesomeness about 12 hours later.    My **only** complaint would be that the staff there had 2 of their kids who were hanging out in the dining room which did, at times, take away from my moment.  But I understand it's not easy to produce such awesome food and daycare is pricey so I was able to still bust out 5 stars."}
{"text":"After watching the movie Chef, I was on a mission to find a Cubano sandwich in Madison. Granted I'd never really had one before, so I can't speak for authenticity or compare to other Cubanos.   BUT! This place has our souls. My husband and I tried their sandwich and immediately fell in love. Note: I'm salivating while writing this review. The guasacaca is a great condiment, but not necessary for this juicy sandwich. The pork roast was plentiful, flavorful, and tender.   The plantain chips can certainly put me in a food coma.  And I would welcome it."}
{"text":"Make sure to bus your own baskets/plates!   Do not base your order off of mine, I require exponentially more calories per day than the average Joe, this would suffice for multiple people.  I had the Papi Venezolano. It was great but heavy for a single person with additional items coming (it's a fried food sampler). I would say this would be enough for 2-3 people to share as an app. Everything was delectable but be careful Hot!  I also had 2 Arepas- one with black bean White Cheese and shredded beef, another with Ham and White Cheese. The triple ingredient one was a little sloppy to eat but delicious! Areas come solo no sides and absolutely piping hot off the grill, but they are delicious!  For my sweets I had the Pie de Parchita. Oh my, god that thing is awesome.... Its a passionfruit pie(ce) of mother fucking heavennnnnnn.... Do it.   All in all it was very affordable for the amount of calories and the filling nature! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great little joint on Madison's East Side for South of The Panama Canal eats. For those not very adventurous on their first time, there's always arepas, which are simple sandwiches where the \"bread\" is a pocket instead of slices. The empanadas are slightly different than most South American varieties as the shell is made from corn meal. The Aji Crillo (green) sauce IMO could use a little more \"pop\", but the flavor is good.  It's not fancy, but the quality is good. Check it out."}
{"text":"I'm an immediate convert. Not only is the food delicious, but they have tasty Venezuelan sodas, facts about Venezuela plastered all over the restaurant, and an incredibly friendly and gracious owner. Come hungry or prepare to bring home part of your meal in a takeaway container. One arepa goes a long way!"}
{"text":"I came here last week with my brother and had a great experience. Since it was my first time the guy at the counter explained the menu and options available and was eager to answer any questions or make suggestions.   The food was good, I got a beef empanada and the corn pancakes with side of eggplant instead of pork. The nata sauce was so good! The arepa we ordered was good but I had gotten it with the piccadillo salad. I wasn't the biggest fan of the salad in the arepa just too much tomatoes for my preference. Next time I have a better idea of what I would get in the arepa."}
{"text":"La Taguara is some of the best food I've had.  The staff is nice, helpful, and the atmosphere is great.  My friend and I split a few dishes.  I want to try everything!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal we've had in Madison so far. We ordered Arepas, Empanadas, a Cubano Sandwich and started off with Tostones (crispy fried plantain patties). The Arepas and Empanadas were ordered as part of the lunch special that came with soup (or salad). We tried both of the soups of the day and those were great too."}
{"text":"Service was awesome ... cashier took the time to explain every plate and similarities to Mexican dishes. I wasn't a fan of the chorizo but that may be cause of my Mexican self =) but everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Arepas, Arepas, Arepas...you can choose what you want stuffed inside. I chose eggplant, black beans and white cheese=delicious! Lesson learned though. One arepa at this location is more than enough. I think the eggplant is microwaved but either way it is pretty delicious...has a nice flavor and the ingredients work very well together.   I have been to their other location on Johnson, which I prefer for aesthetic reasons. Plus the gal on Johnson was much nicer and friendlier than the interaction I had on Washington. Next time I should branch out and try something different."}
{"text":"Some say this has the best Venezuelan food in Madison, I would say it has some of the best food....period.  Fresh. Authentic. Made on the spot. Local Hispanic population usually taking up most tables. I don't really want others to know about this gem, but needed to balance a crappy review I just wrote for the Stamm house. This food is better at one third the cost."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! I am a native of Caracas, Venezuela, currently living in Iowa. I was in Madison to see Dan Savage and Jamie Kilstein at UW and as soon as I saw the sign for La Taguara, I knew we had to stop for breakfast. Man, was it worth it!!!! Super fresh, beautiful decor, very friendly service and the shredded beef arepas are the best in the Midwest. It made me happy to also find Cocosette, Boleros, Nucita. A Venezuelan gem! Eat here nowwwww!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have a dish from LA Tagura that I didn't love. Everything is cooked with pride and it shines through in the perfect balance of spices in the shredded beef. The arepas are always perfectly done. Regrettably I am allergic to plantains but they always look delicious too. The passion fruit pie is a little slice of heaven. The coconut rice pudding is great to take home it is an abundant portion and will last a couple of days, and is so tasty. I recommend a stop here if you've never had south american food its unforgettable in a good way, and I guarantee you'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The food had so much flavor and the sauces they have mmm mmm. Venezuelan food is very good and coming across restaurants that serve this cuisine can be rare, so when you find one please try it and order a few different items so you can get the whole experience!   I had some arepas and empanadas with sides, everything was amazing. The service was super friendly and helpful. Whenever I go to Madison I usually consider eating here, one of my favorite places in town.  Simply put, this is one of the best in the area and worth the stop!"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to spot for spicy food. A smattering of their mild sauce with a spoonful of food is spicier than any other restaurant I've found so far. Their hot sauce is some of the spiciest stuff I've had, anywhere.   They don't give you much, because they expect you to spread a bit on your whole dish, but they'll give you as much as you want if you ask, and it's amazing.  Edit: I tried this place again about a year later, and it wasn't nearly as spicy! The food is still good, but they toned down the spice level."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm and the place was still busy with people.  At La Taguara, you order at the counter and then find your own seat.  I ordered the mojito en coco which is minced fish cooked in a coconut sauce.  It came with crispy green plantains, a side of rice, and picadillo salad (like a tomato salsa).  The fish was tasty and the acidity of picadillo salad added a brightness to the buttery richness of the coconut sauce.  I was not a fan of the plantains that they served me though.  It was too hard.  Maybe if it had been sliced thinner so that it was more like a plantain chip instead of a overcooked fried plantain.    My friend ordered the pabellon which, according to the menu, is the Venezuelan National Dish.  It contains shredded beef and came with black beans, an arepa, and deep fried sweet plantains.  I liked the plantains on this dish better, but the best plantains I've had is still at Cafe Costa Rica.  The black beans were really good though.  They were umami flavorful.    They also serve a variety of juices including passion fruit, tamarind, and sugar cane with lime juice.  I ordered the tamarind and it came in a huge glass.  This is the only place in Madison that I know of with tamarind juice.  I'm eager to come back and try their other juices and sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is some quality food, people.  If you have never had an arepa, stop here and try one.  You can't get these in many places, in fact not sure if Madison has had them since my friend from Colombia moved away.  We stopped on a Sunday for breakfast that had shredded beef, beans and an egg (served with an arepa) with avocado on the side.  This was a nice portion, very tasty and a nice change from the Madison area \"traditional breakfast\".  Try this, you will be a fan.  Oh, have some Venezuelan coffee too, it is definitely a cut above your standard breakfast joints coffee."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and was glad I did. The staff is incredibly friendly and truly shows they appreciate your business. My friend and I both got the Cubano sandwich which was freshly made and filled with delicious meat. The sandwich came with soup or salad, so we chose the soup of the day which was a chicken soup. It was the best soup I have ever had at a restaurant. We also decided to split a chicken arepa, however after trying it she decided she wanted it all to herself and I had to go back up and order my own, and yes it was that good. The sweet corn cake its served on was incredible. If you're in the area definitely stop in and try some food you've probably never had before, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The owner has cleaned up the old Dmitiri's space and made it his own.  Order from the counter and relax while amazing, homestyle Venezuelan food is prepared.  I'm somewhat new to Venezuelan, but it seems to be similar to other Caribbean/Central American and not as hot-forward spicy as Mexican can be:  homestyle plates of meat/beans/rice, with sides of fried plantains and the ever-present arepas, empanadas, and pastels.  And all of it is wonderful.    We tried the Pabellon, an arepa, and an empanada.  The Pabellon is, according to the menu, the national dish of Venezuela, consists of a giant plate of shredded beef seasoned with garlic and not-hot peppers, cilantro rice, three slices of fried plantain, a small arepa, and a portion of black beans with a refried consistency and topped with a white cheese.  The arepa, which comes as a side with the Pabellon and other dishes, can also be stuffed and made into a sandwich.  We had one stuffed with ham, and it was delicious.  It is deep fried, like many items on the menu, but not at all greasy.  The outside comes out crisp while the inside is a nice, moist texture.  We also tried an empanada, which also comes filled with your choice of meat, and is deep fried.  The empanada and arepa are also served with guasacaca, which sounds somewhat foreboding but is actually a garlicky sauce made with green peppers and avocado and tastes great.   I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after attending Art Fair on the Square. Very casual counter service place with great Latin American food. Contrary to popular belief none of our food was spicy, but it was well seasoned and flavorful. A number of the dishes O wasn't familiar with but the friendly woman behind the counter helped us make our decision. Very reasonably priced and definitely worth a stop. And they are even opened early on Saturday and Sunday, for brunch."}
{"text":"Every time I make in to Madison from Texas I will always make it in to eat dinner here, definitely a hidden treasure. The food is delicious and the service is fantastic! I rant and rave about this place back in Texas because it is that GOOD! I will always keep coming back.  Pictured is the Pabellón a Caballo."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Staff are SUPER friendly and will explain you every ingredient in the menu. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"A slice of South America in Madison.  If you've ever been to Central or South America, then you'll really appreciate this authentic cuisine...if you've never been come try it out. The food is fresh and plentiful. I ordered two of the Arepas (like a corn English muffin). One stuffed with shredded beef, pork and black beans; while the other was filled with chicken, cheese and beans. I was challenged to finish both as they were heaped full with the most tender-juicy fillings one could imagine. The guasacara (green sauce) is ridiculous! Not really spicy, just full of flavor. To drink I had Papelon con Limon (sugar cane drink with lime juice. Try it...you'll love it.  The menu is extensive and the cashier is happy to explain it to help to make a selection. Do yourself a favor and come try out La Taguara, I promise you'll come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had the garlic shrimp dish and the pabellon and loved them both. We had the rice pudding for dessert. It was delicious. Not the greatest location but easiest to get to once you know it exists. Very clean restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I forced my friend Brandon to drive me here from campus because of the dank yelp reviews!! We had a blast and our friend Anneliis said this was one of her top 5 meals. I had the Pabellon a Caballo (pictured in, like, everyone's reviews...) which seems to be, rightfully, their most popular dish! Deliciousness and freshness!! We tried the passion fruit juice (sweet & tasty), the tamarind juice (unique & refreshing), the grilled white cheese (OMGGG), beef and chicken empanadas (purty good), and for dessert- the rice coconut pudding and Tequeños de Guayaba y Queso (fried white cheese and guava sprinkled with confectioner's sugar). This was SO GOOD! My favorite part was the cheese dessert- sweet and savory; I highly recommend trying it. Probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. I ate too much cheese though- decide on either a cheese app or dessert! NOT BOTH ;) Will be back as soon as I can find another amigo with a car, or Brandon agrees to take me again..."}
{"text":"Best food in town! Quality ingredients and quality service makes for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Don't miss out on this place! This place may not be down town, but it's worth the trip.  La Taguara features a wide selection of Venezuelan (NOT MEXICAN!!!) comfort food. I'm a fan of their appetizers, especially the refreshing and light ceviche.  For entrees, I like to get the cachapa y cochino frito. The cachapa is like a sweet corn cake made into a quesadilla, and the cochino frito is chunks of juicy fried pork. It's a delicious and seriously filling meal.  Despite those great menu items, my absolute favorite are their arepas. For $4.99, you can get a thick, crispy corn cake stuffed with 2 different fillings with additional fillings for 49 cents. This is hot, juicy sandwich from Venezuela is an absolute bargain, and it's incredibly delicious! There are great arepas options for vegetarians and carnivores alike. My two favorite combos are the pernil (slow roasted pork) with white cheese and the chicken with black beans. The pernil is shredded roast pork soaked in what seems like tomato-based stew with some green olives, and its flavor goes well with the melty white cheese. The chicken tastes like its in a Japnese curry mix or something, and the black beans help mellow it out while adding savory flavor and a thick texture.  Bottom line: try an Arepa today! One is a good meal, two is a good feast."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and both times have been fantastic! The staff is sooooo friendly and helpful - explaining everything, and giving suggestions. The fried yucca is out of this world...we will order it every single time we go there, for sure. Very difficult for the hubby to decide if he likes the pork or beef better, so will likely always order an arepa of each. I have had the fried fish (YUM), and this last time tried their vegetarian arepa - somehow they have made eggplant to resemble pulled pork. The flavor and texture were sooooo good. Cheese empanada was quite tasty as well (and quite chzy!!). Tamarind and passion fruit juices are both delicious. We will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and was not dissapointed. Dining area is small but very clean. Personal was friendly and my food came out pretty fast. I ordered Pabellon and this dish was really good. It is a lot of food on 1 plate. Meat was perfectly cooked. I will be back to try some more items on the menu."}
{"text":"We looked forward to our visit here but were disappointed.   Though I'm no expert on this style of S American food I found all samples to be more like state fair food than cuisine.   The empanadas were greasy and uninteresting.   The chips were thick, greasy, and heavy...not my idea of a tasty chip.   There were no interesting or definitive tastes we experienced. Will not go back...too many other good restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"My husband and kids stopped in for dinner today, passing through during a road trip. The food was so good and I loved the gluten-free options too. I loved the Venezuelan food. The fried plantains were heavenly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times and the food is always very good. I would have given it 5 stars, but the lady at the desk was kind of rude. She talked to me as if I were dumb, and on top of that she would talk over the man behind the desk who was *extremely* pleasant and helpful. The guy was really patient with me, and kind. I thought he was really good at giving suggestions and explaining things (when the rude lady wasn't interrupting him). If you go, and there's a taller guy with a beard working at the counter, you are in good hands! 5 stars for him, 4 for the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have 4 words:  You must eat here!!!!!!!! Seriously! And for so many reasons.  The Venezuelan husband and wife team who own/run La Taguara are just too fantastic to even be believed - warm, genuine, helpful, hospitable and man alive, can they create beautiful food. Everything was so authentic and they are truly trying to educate people on the food of their culture & share some of their passion for it.  We started with the Queso Frito (fried cheese) appetizer. It was so incredible I wished we'd ordered 2. They make the cheese by hand in-house. It's insane!!!!!!!! Trust me, order it. Early & often. You'll be so happy you did. We got to sample their 3 flavors of juices and we very much look forward to ordering the passion fruit blend sometime. Crazy flavorful & just the right amount of tart.    My husband had the Pabellon a Caballo and he loved everything about it, especially the pork as it was so flavorful & tender. I had the Bandejita Paisa. It was delicious! And I have to say, I was so surprised that I enjoyed the plantains so much. The pork belly was crisp & flavorful. I stuffed the arepa with a slice of seasoned beef, avocado and rice.  There was no room for dessert. But we'll be back again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"First time trying Velenzuelan food... this place is a little hole in the wall & it's delish, a hidden gem for sure! It's a must try, trust me you will not be dissapointed.. & the staff is so attentive & friendly! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"2 star for Food. But 1 Extra Star for Great Customer Service.  This was our first time here. The place is a cute little joint with a open kitchen order concept ala food trucks. The guy at the front was very polite and explained everything really well. We ordered Bandejita Paisa and Cubano Sandwich entrees and Papelon con Limon as a side drink.  The Bandejita Paisa was OK for its Beans and Rice flavor profiles ang the runny egg!. The Steak was Over Cooked till death, to the point of being uneatable. The sausage was dry with a strangely hard to cut outer casing. The Crispy Pork Belly was average since a lot of Ends were rather chewy.  The Cubano Sandwich was a better bet. Still, on its own, not really worth the money. The meat portion was impressive but lacked flavor and dry and stringy.  Looking at all the glowing reviews, I'd imagine we just came in on a bad day. Still for nearly $35 for two people, this ain't worth another trip. All in all, If you were to give this place a try, stay away from the Steak for sure!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I am an idiot.  Case in point, in took my until now to visit La Taguara.  Obviously, I didn't know what I was missing out on-amazing food.  This is comfort food at it's finest.  The interior won't blow you away, it's rather sparse but very clean.  Put your order in at the counter and wait to be impressed on what get's delivered to the table.  I opted for the Chachapa con Queso y Cochno Frito or more simply-pure deliciousness.  A homemade sweet corn pancake filled with homemade cheese and a side of fried pork.  Pair that up with some nata (similar to mexican crema) and guasacaca (a smooth sauce made with avocado and cilantro) and you are good to go.  The staff were incredible helpful in helping explain and provide recommendations.  They also have a decent line up of south american and spanish beers.  While I seldom venture over to  that side of town, I would drive solely to come here.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Casual ambiance, order from the counter, but the food is made fresh to order. This was my first empanada made from scratch - DELICIOUS! The staff is super friendly and helpful navigating an unfamiliar menu."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times & enjoyed it each time. The service is fast, the food is delicious though I couldn't find my eggplant in my food this last time. Hopefully next time I do."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  10/10, not would but WILL eat again!  I had the pabellon, but between 8 in our group we had a wide range of appetizers, arepas, and main dishes.  None of us had tried Venezuelan food before, but everyone enjoyed every dish - that includes two small children, who had no problem with this new food.    It's all the fundamentals of a good restaurant - quality ingredients prepared well with a smile for a very fair price.  No bells and whistles, just a quality eating experience.  My only complaint is that they do not have a west side location that is closer to my home!"}
{"text":"Delicious, just delicious :-)  Our visit was the first time that I have ever had Venezuelan food. Really good. I also had a Venezuelan drink, and it was good too. It is a very straight forward restaurant. Basic decor and you order at the counter, but that is totally cool because the food is yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly staff that will help you with the menu. Venezuelan food is very good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions, and cheap prices with a simple pay-at-the-front and wait for your number setup.  Small, private parking lot for this almost hidden location. Once inside, the interior is familiar from Caribbean and Colombian places with bright yellow walls. The menu is up on a digital display screen. Everything o the menu looked delicious.  For our appetizer, we ordered the rompe colchon, which is a lot more food than it looks. This is a very rich shrimp salsa that you use as a dip for plantain chips. It was quite intensely flavored, perhaps a bit too rich, so make sure you share with at least one other person.  For entree, I did the Bandejita Paisa, which is almost a sampler platter of everything with beef, pork belly, chorizo, egg, platanos maduros, rice, pinto beans, avocado, cheese, and arepa. This was an enormous amount of food, especially for the price.  Wife ordered the Camarones al Ajillo, which was sautéed garlic shrimp with salad, tostones, and guasacaca (similar to guacamole). She loved it.  Given the super casual setup, good prices, and delicious food; I have to give it 5-stars. Definitely check it out for a unique change of pace in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say we didn't love La Taguara. I've been wanting to go after seeing their strong Yelp reviews. I will say that I'm not a fan of fried food in general, so that probably colors this review.   We walked up to the counter to order, and I was a little overwhelmed by the menu. There were some things I hadn't heard of before, so I wasn't sure what to get. The person working at the counter was not very friendly; she seemed irritated that I asked a question, and she was kind of cold when we asked a question about clean up later. (You bus your own table, which we were happy to do.)  We got El Papu Venezolano for an appetizer. The beef empanadas were VERY good. Everything else that came with it honestly didn't have much flavor... it just tasted fried. It did come with three sauces (one sour cream, two traditional), but I didn't love those either. :(   I got an arepa, and I didn't do a great job of picking what to go in it. I picked pork (very flavorful, but a bit too much pork for the size of the arepa), black beans (good), and cheese (nothing special and sort of stuck in the bottom). It was OK.   My boyfriend got the Pabellón and also thought it was okay. Good, not great.    Maybe I had my hopes too high, and maybe I need to try again with a different order. Sad to be disappointed here since it otherwise seems so well loved!"}
{"text":"Been here twice within a week. This is my new favorite place. If you ask for the owner's recommendation, he will tell you about the two most popular dishes. Both are incredible, but the second choice is what I urge you to choose. It is absolutely sublime. Viva La Taguara."}
{"text":"Every once in a while you stumble on to a hidden gem. This under the radar, hole-in-the wall is such a place. The demise of Jolly Bob's in Madison left not only a lonely emptiness in my heart, but also a big lapse in that kind of food - that bright, spicy, imaginative caribbean-influenced plate of glorious inspiration that sends your eyes rolling back in delight. Gone was the \"Avocat,\" \"Blackjack,\" and \"Curry Friend Thighs.\"   While not directly analogous to JB's Caribbean and Jerk approach, La Taguara, a Venezuelan restaurant, provided me with the first culinary \"yahoo!\" moment that I've had in Madison in quite a while, and from a flavor profile standpoint, it reminded me a lot of Jolly Bob's.   Upon finding this place in its unlikely, behind-a-building East Washington Avenue, middle of nowhere ubran sprawl location, we entered and sat down at one of the maybe 8 tables in the place. A woman stared at us from behind the counter. Ah, this is an order at the counter kind of place.   We ordered up two dishes:  Rompe Colchon  Shrimp marinated in lime juice, tossed with fresh tomatoes, avocados, onions and cilantro served with plantain chips  This dish is similar to Mexican ceviche, but it had something more, some sort of spice alchemy that I couldn't quite pin down, but I was content to revel in its magic. We both took one bite of this and our eyes went wide open. An explosion of delicious. We also added some of their house-made super spicy sauce. I think this stuff is fueled by Scotch Bonnet peppers. It's intensely spicy and bright. The dish was surrounded with plantain chips. Nothing short of delicious.   Next up was:  Mojito en Coco  Minced fish cooked in a well seasoned coconut sauce served with rice, crispy green plantains, picadillo salad and guasacaca  Lord of all things mighty! Knights of Columbus! Kelly Clarkson!! This was fantastic. I've only tasted something like this one other time and it was at a place called La Habichuela in downtown Cancun, MEX - one of Cancun's priciest restaurants. It's a fish curry with lots of coconut flavors. It's served with white rice, some plantain tostones, some green goodness for dipping and a hale portion of what is similar to pico de gallo. Just plain delicious. It has us both singing and rocking in our chairs.   The place also has homemade drinks that are similar to agua frescas. On this night they had Tamarind, Sugar Cane and Passion Fruit varieties. We had the passion fruit and it was delicious, light and refreshing.   Two of us were in and out of this place, completely sated, for less than $40 all-in, including some beers from the wide global selection. A fabulous value.  This place provides the kind of unvarnished, unassuming but over-the-top delicious dining that I try to scour out of every town I visit. We'll be back - and often!"}
{"text":"Great South American food. Excellent arepas, great food selection and my favorite, platanos!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to their brick and mortar, but I did get to try a very tasty beef arepa at their pop-up stand at Central Park Sessions. When I placed my order for one arepa the cashier asked \"just the arepa?\" and I briefly doubted my choice would be substantial enough, but I decided I could just come back through the line if I was still hungry. As it turns out, there is not a chance I could eat another bite after that hefty sandwich. It felt like a brick in my hand, but gratefully did not feel like a brick in my stomach.  The arepa itself was somehow substantial but light and it was stuffed with delicious shredded beef. It came with a cilantro sauce (I assume it's their take on guasacaca) that the cashier assured me unprompted \"wasn't spicy\" - apparently one too many spice-averse people had gone through the line before me. The sandwich had enough flavor that it didn't need a spicy sauce, but I wouldn't have objected to a little kick.   They recently opened up a location closer to downtown and I'm excited to make my way in to sample some more Venezuelan dishes."}
{"text":"We stopped by here after looking for something close as we were just outside of the Capitol region.  This is a very good place that I would return to at anytime.  There is a small parking lot in front but you can't make a direct left turn in or left turn out when you leave.  They asked us if we had come here before and when we admitted we hadn't, the young lady hostess explained the main things people order and different we combinations that are complementary rather than repeating the same things.  Someone else had ordered the pabellon and the cachapa, so the staff person showed us what it was.  We went with the pabellon (without egg) along with an arepa.  We chose the potato chicken salad with avocado rather than the shredded beef or black beans since it was already a part of the pabellon.  They also checked to see if we were really hungry since the pabello tends to be big.    Since it wasn't that busy they told us that they would either call our number to pick up at the counter or they would bring it to our table.  Well, ours came to the table and the plate was pretty heavy since she spilled a few drops of the beans.  The pabellon was filled all the way to the side with black beans, white rice, corn cake, 3 sliced deep fried plantains, and a good portion of the shredded beef.  The server was also nice enough to ask if we wanted an extra plate since we were pretty obvious about sharing our meal.    The arepa was pretty well stuffed with the potato chicken salad which also contained boiled carrots.  The corn cake was well toasted to give it good texture and hold up the filling.  The guasacaca sauce has plenty of cilantro, which I definitely like.  I went up to get some of the passion fruit juice as well since it was a fitting complement to the meal.  It was quite sweet so I had to water it down with plenty of ice.  Overall, the place is very welcoming for first time visitors and will make you want to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place. Arepas are just the best thing ever. It's quick and easy with nice people there."}
{"text":"There food was delicious. I got the corn pancakes with cheese in the middle and fried pork on the side. My dad ordered the plantains with shrimp on the side. Both were very excellent and the girl working the counter was very patient with us. Lovely service!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, along with not taking shortcuts in making their traditional dishes with a twist, make the difference here.  The setting is straightforward and nothing to behold, but it was clean and colorful."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for such a long time!  I ended up going a few months ago but only ordered the fried ripe plantain.  Though it would have been  silly to base my opinion of the place on a random appetizer I should have known, based on the plantains, that this place wasn't that great.  The plantains we super ripe even by ripe plantain standards.  Either way, I decided to go back based on the glowing reviews.  The restaurant is small or cozy depending on how you look at it.  When you come in you order at the counter and can pick your own seat.  They have a decent sized menu which was nice.  I am not very familiar with Venezuelan food so I was really excited to try out a new cuisine.  I ordered the shredded beef, black beans, rice, and plantains. The presentation was nice though I could have used a bit more than three plantains.  The rice was good!  It had a nice buttery flavor though I wished it had a bit more of that flavor.  The beans were alright as well.  They weren't stand out by any means but they weren't bad.  I had read that the shredded beef was really good but this is item by which I was most dissapointed.  The flavors were decent but I could not get over how chewy it was.  On the plus side I was able to pass the beef over to the husband and he thought it was great.  He ordered the rice, beans, pork belly, and chorizo.  From what I heard the chorizo was great; nice and spicy.  He however was not a fan of the fried pork belly.  I liked these a bit so I was more than happy to remove these from his plate.  All and all it will probably be a while before I go back to this place.  We weren't blown away by any of our dishes.  I do look forward however to trying something new and perhaps updating this review."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch and had the sweet corn pancake (cachapa) with crispy fried pork belly,guasacaca sauce, and some passion fruit juice. Staff were very friendly and helpful with making recommendations and describing items in detail. I will be back to try some of their lunch and dinner specials."}
{"text":"Welcome to the Bolivarian Republic of awesome.   For someone who took 8 years of Spanish between 7th grade and college, I knew embarrassingly little about Venezuela. So how did I learn a little more? How else but to order the pabellon, Venezuela's national dish? With the first bite of juicy, seasoned, roasted shredded beef, I am transported to Caracas and arrive on the beach, drinking a native Polar Beer. Gnawing that beef down with rice and black beans and fried plantain slices and an arepa (a crispy, doughy puff of heaven) and a couple empanadas, my Venezuelan journey is complete, and it cost less than $25.   The space is spotless, the service friendly beyond belief, and the rest of the menu is begging for me to sample it. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Oh yes please! I met some friends for lunch here today, and I'm already thinking about when I can make it back!  I had the empanada lunch with plantain soup and it was delicious. The empanadas (I especially liked the beef one) came with a yummy guasacaca sauce. Some of my friends got the salad instead of the soup and it also looked really good. Very fast service too! I meant to take a picture but all of a sudden my food was gone. I'll try to get one next time. I can't wait to try the pabellon. And wait, they deliver?!?! Hmm, I will be at work tomorrow...   Update...definitely try the pabellón! It is a lot of food, even without the egg on top. But, you know what? Every last bite of it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So real, this place is awful out! If you want amazingly flavored authentic Mexican food this is where you want to go. It is not flashy, they are fairly bare bones in their Decour. But that's OK because the food makes up for it 10 times over. The service is very friendly, and the flavors you get here you will not find anywhere else in the Madison area"}
{"text":"Hey ya'll! There's a new restaurant on E. Wash and it's the first Venezuelan restaurant in Madison! Although Venezuelan cuisine bears some similarities to Mexican food, it's also distinctively different. Instead of salsa, they have a sauce called guasacaca, which I think is cilantro-based but tastes nothing like cilantro. It's slightly creamy and garlicky. They also have a spicy and really spicy version of that. Yucca is the potato of Latin America and you can order yucca fries under appetizers. I ordered the 3 taco plate (which is really just 3 tacos, for $5.99). One shredded chicken, one shredded beef, and one pernil (roast pork). Unfortunately, I got them to go and could not determine which was which, but two of them were good and one of them was excellent.  After conferring with my bf, who ate half of them, we have come to the conclusion that it was probably the pernil that was the best. The tacos came on double corn tortillas which were soft and tasted fresh, and were topped with cilantro and chopped onion, Mexico City style. They also offer freshly made tamarind and passion fruit juice (freshly squeezed, yo). And sugarcane lemonade. Do it. We may have to return to conduct a more thorough investigation of their menu. They have some lunch specials on Mon-Fri, 11-2pm which look like pretty good deals (see menu on website). There are some empanadas and arepas (kind of like savory turnovers).  If you are into spicy food, you'll love their guasacaca. If you're not into spicy foods, they've got stuff here for you too. Get over to La Taguara ASAP!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere with a warm welcome. Food was tasty and delicious. Passion fruit juice was on point. Arepas were awesome. Bandeja paisa was very fulfilling. Would only change the type of rice to long grain and remove the cheese from the beans for an even more typical dish."}
{"text":"Small parking lot but plenty of street parking. Delicious comfort food. Cubano sandwich was full of tender meat, arepa and empanadas were good and my toddler's mini beef empanadas were perfect size. The shredded chicken was just a little on the dry side, otherwise good. Plantain chips weren't greasy. Love hole in the walls like this."}
{"text":"Love the Patacon Pisao- it's ridiculously good and so satisfying. The lunch specials are a great deal. A good place to bring visitors to town for a great taste of Venezuelan food and a nice big meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am familiar with Venezuelan cuisine from having studied abroad and returning again afterward, so I was thrilled to give it a try when La Taguara opened. Now that I have been there a few times I can say it will not let you down.   Authentic cuisine, delicious, reasonable prices, very friendly staff and the owner seems to always be there. A few days ago my family and I went to try out their traditional Christmas fare, and was not dissapointed. Even with the higher prices for the seasonal plates, 4 of us ate until we were completely stuffed to the gills, for about $75 including several drinks.    My favorites so far-  Cachapas, pabellon, empanadas, and of course the seasonally available Hallacas. Mmmm, navidad!  Service is counter-style. Walk up, peruse the menu and ask questions of the friendly service staff at the counter. Place your order, pay, and have a seat. The food is then brought out to your table.  In the questionaire below, it asks if this location has a TV.  I am going to answer yes because they do have 2 TVs, but they are (always?) playing a sort of Venezuelan slide-show. I like it, really. But I do not know if they occasionally show anything else on that or if it is even hooked up to cable.   My only regret is that I cannot order from La Taguara for delivery, and it's location is not exactly on the walking-around-Madison path. Please go try this wonderful little place!"}
{"text":"I've been told that Madison doesn't have particularly great non-American food. Well La Taguara, a Venezuelan joint, is a strong exception to that rule. The  pabellon is a hearty meal with flavorful beef, fluffy rice, and pleasing beans. We also got the shrimp/avocado quac-type things with the tostones as chips. Definitely get that. It's one of the appetizers and is a textually unique and bright flavored dish. Big fan."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing. The arepas are very good and the queso de mano tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food you'll find vegetarian options as well staff is ready to help with selections"}
{"text":"First time trying the place. Great experience! Cozy place, Decors very patriotic of their native land. Love the desserts, kids love it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went with a big group and we all got something different so I got to taste many dishes. Everything was delicious.  The owner is so nice, informative,and passionate about his food! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A big nod to mojo to en coco. I may have found new foreign cuisine love. I never had Venezuelan dishes before. It turns out, they are down right delicious. And the hit sauce is down right hot and delicious.   At first my novio and I were stuck at the counter. We are both vegetarians, so it was difficult to make entree selections. But the family behind the counter was very helpful for giving us the right substitution and guiding through the menu. They are such nice people!! Wouldn't you love talking to the owners who are enthusiastic about introducing their culture?   Whatever you order, don't forget the two things: tamarindo + hot sauce = happiness."}
{"text":"The owner greeting us and explaining the menu really made the group of us fall in love with this place. The flavorful and homemade food also helped too! The passion fruit dressing on the salad was so good! Loved the tostones and arepas as well."}
{"text":"This place is convenient to the airport. Great South American/Caribbean food. Fresh food that taste good. Great job on the fried tostones."}
{"text":"Wow. Already over 200 reviews of this place? Not surprised in the least. The service, the food, the environment are dang near perfection. I asked the woman at the cashier if she knew about yelp because I was about to write this place a super fresh review, and she was like hmm no, what's that? It was like they were being genuinely great without the goal of \"good reviews.\" Can you believe it?!  Outside seating is nice when it's not too hot or with direct sunlight in the afternoon. If your tastes are craving sweet, savory, cool, or hot, you *will* find something that leaves you completely satisfied. I can still taste the savory fish dish with rice the same woman recommended."}
{"text":"After my recent visit to La Tagura, I am tempted to change their Yelp category to Soul Food.  While it doesn't fit the strict culinary definition of soul food, the food served here truly satisfies the soul of those who consume it.  And with each flavor-filled bite, it's obvious that the kitchen is putting their heart and soul into each dish they prepare.  I appreciate how the restaurant extracted so much flavor from the food despite working with the simplest of ingredients.  If you appreciate this style of cooking, it worth making the trip to Madison's north side.    The restaurant is a bare bones operation; don't expect pictures of the interior to show up in the next issue of Martha Stewart Living.  The interior is small with clean golden yellow walls, decorated with various Venezuelan knick-knacks.  A muted flat screen mounted on the wall shows a looping slideshow of pictures from Venezuela.  The standard issue table and chairs and the drop ceiling also fit right into the basic diner décor theme.    You order at the counter and they call out your number when your food is ready.  The owner asked us if we had eaten at La Taguara before.  When we said we had not, he enthusiastically provided us with a guided tour of the menu.  He pointed out the most popular items on the menu and deftly explained the differences between arepas, empanadas and pastelitos.     I decided to go with the pernil (roasted pork) arepa lunch special ($7.99), which included a choice of soup or salad.  The soup option I selection, the sancocho, was a combination of vegetables, beef and chicken in a delightfully flavorful broth and helped awaken my taste buds for the rest of my meal.  The arepa is a Venezuelan version of the pita sandwich.  The pocket bread is made from a white corn meal fried on the grilled behind the front counter.  While the exterior was not crispy, it still provided a pleasant textural contrast with the shredded pork interior.  Like the soup, the pork was expertly prepared, fork-tender and well seasoned.  It was a wee bit dry but that was quickly remedied by added the tantalizing guasacaca sauce to the sandwich.  If you have never tried this staggeringly tasty combination of avocado, fresh parsley and coriander, green bell pepper, onion, garlic, salt, oil and vinegar, get off your hindquarters and make a beeline to La Taguara.  It alone is worthy of a pilgrimage to this north side eatery.  My dining companion, who grew up in Bolivia, was equally impressed with his order of Pabellon (black beans, white cheese, shredded beef, rice and deep fried sweet plantain and an arepa).  I am not alone in my enthusiasm for the food at La Taguara.  There was a steady flow of customers streaming through the restaurant on a Tuesday lunch service.  Do yourself a favor and join them."}
{"text":"We live in Cross Plains and will drive all the way to the East side for this delicious food!  Everything we have had here has been spot on!  The tostones, plantains, arepas, etc. etc. etc. I love that you can see them cooking their menu items from scratch when you are up at the ordering counter.  It really shows in the flavor of the food. I need to find my next reason to drive to this area of town so I can make a pit stop! :)"}
{"text":"A few weeks back I was talking to someone about empanadas and they said \"if you're in Madison, you have to try La Taguara\". So I bookmarked it and lo and behold, was able to stop in this past weekend.  First, the location is super convenient - right off 30 & Washington. There's a small parking lot and a small, simply decorated eating area. You place orders at the counter and the friendly staff will happily walk you through the menu if you aren't familiar with the cuisine.   Of course, we ordered empanadas (one beef, one chicken) - they're BIG. Two would make a meal - ours were well stuffed, full of flavor but perhaps a tad oily. Get them anyway, they're delicious.   For mains, the Mister had cachapa which is a corn pancake filled with homemade cheese and served with fried pork chunks. Very tasty but FILLING! I went with pabellon which is rice, black beans and stewed beef. It reminded me of Cuban ropa vieja - tender beef stewed with peppers, so delicious especially when mixed up with the rice and amazingly tasty black beans. Seriously, those beans are everything - I'd happily order beans and rice as a meal.  Prices are cheap (most things $10-12), portions are huge (my entree could easily have fed 2) and it's delicious. Feel free to open a satellite location in Milwaukee, La Tagura!"}
{"text":"This place really is as good as it gets. Fast and friendly staff that are more than willing to explain the menu and even give a couple of delicious and fun tips to make sure the dining experience is nothing less than exceptional.   The food here is incredible - everything is delicious. It is so hard to explore the menu because your last meal is always calling you back. There are no complaints here whatsoever. Prices are more than reasonable (lunch specials are great) and portions are awesome.  They do offer a punch card for frequent lunchers - if it's your first stop I'd recommend getting one - you will be here again. So tasty."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today because of all the positive reviews. My friend and I both really loved our food. I'm happy to report that this is a very vegetarian friendly restaurant, serving delicious, ample portions of thoughtfully prepared food.  On the advice of our server, I ordered the national dish of Venezuela, Pabellon, which they were happy to prepare with eggplant in place of the usual meat.  Everything was delicious and although I was pretty hungry from our hike at Devil's Lake, it was more than I could eat.  My companion was also very pleased with his empanadas.  He had considered ordering three with rice and beans, because empanadas can be very small, right?  But he was more than content with two.  These are generously sized portions.  Just a word about beans, because - I'll be frank - I've been eating beans as a main source of protein and I'm a bit of a freak about them.  Obviously I can't speak to the non-veggie beans, but the black beans are vegetarian and they are simply delicious.   While not fancy, the restaurant is clean and welcoming.  I loved the  videos of Venezuela playing (silently) on the few TVs."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and I haven't been disappointed any of those times. I am not familiar with Venezuelan food so I can't speak to authenticity but I can say that this is the best Latin American food that I found in Madison. I am a big fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Very clean inside, very friendly staff, and great food! We got the shrimp salsa called \"Rompe Colchon\" and it was yummy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 starts i will but dont let me,for me this food is tasty but to expensive to have the big portion like rice,beans and plantain,and is something that i can make at home and not only that today I went there the Lady that is in front ,taking the orders ,her name is Shujeilys B is how appear on my receipt are always with her bulldog face and very unfriendly and rude,and is the same way at phone ,she said if you dont know how to order you dont need to order ,i talk her this was my first time there, and she start making faces and copying me,what I was saying like mmm i going to order a mmm... and then she said no just said what you want and that set,i feel like disrespected, but any way i pay what I asked ,justfor education because i have education and I learn to be polite ,kind,respectful with others  ,but i never will be returning to this place,this Lady need to learn to be more respectful with costumer, because we are the ones that pay for a good services,and mean to be polite with people, if you are the owner :#1 you do not know how to have and mantain happy to costumers and a good commerce and if you are not the owner,Owner please do something about it and last thing are you do not need to ask where people are from or what is my nacionality, this can look like racist that is the way she always ask costumers about it and third you are there to explain costumers about the menu and take order and if you do not like that way please go back to school and do something where you do not need to be around people"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.  My arepa, which was brimming with flavor and natural ingredients, was only $5! Sure you could get a footlong sub served on yoga mat bread with processed meat for $5, but you would be the loser there.  I've never been to Venezuela so I can't speak to authenticity, though I do eat a lot of food so I can speak to flavor and it was absolutely delicious.   Curiously, this restaurant looks almost identical, both inside and out, to the only other arepas restaurant I've ever been to (VIva Las Arepas outside of Vegas).  This place is nowhere near where I live or work, but I know I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Takeout service was quick and easy. Arepa was soggy. Meat was tough and dry and they could have shredded it better vs some hunks of meat and some shredded. Plantains were like plantain that you can buy at a grocery store. The presentation was sup par but then it was takeout. Nothing impressive and worthwhile coming back for."}
{"text":"Great food, everything was cooked well and had a ton of flavor. Had the Pabellon a Caballo which I would highly recommend. Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito was interesting but not my favorite."}
{"text":"First time for Venezuelan and not the last, this place was awesome. Great food, family friendly, and the owner is great.. You could tell he really enjoyed teaching you about his food. I had the Cachapa con Queso y Cochino Frito for 11.99 - Sweet corn pancakes filled with artisan handcrafted Venezuelan cheese, crispy pork  accompanied with nata and guasacaca. ... I'd like to try everything on the menu but this was so good it's going to be hard to order anything else."}
{"text":"Great casual spot for lunch or dinner.  Dine in or take out, I've had great experience both ways.  The restaurant is bright and clean and offers counter service.  The staff are top-notch.  Always friendly and exceedingly helpful; they take pride in their food and it shows.    Food is delicious.  Great flavors, well prepared, and generous servings.  Lunch specials are definitely a good deal!  The arepas are delightful and overflowing.  Love them with eggplant, white cheese, and picadillo salad.  Both the cheese and chicken empanadas are hits, and the guasacaca sauce is AMAZING (I make trips here just because I'm craving this sauce).  The bandejita paisa is both delicious and large - I took enough home for lunch the next day.  All around great place."}
{"text":"Amazing Cuban Sandwiches! Cute small location with huge flavor! It's a hole in the wall place that you must visit!"}
{"text":"This place is a great example of the gems that escape 'Best Of' lists because it's not downtown. Luckily this also means it's not overrun with yuppies or too crowded.   I didn't really know what Venezuelan food was until coming here, but found myself quickly enchanted by the cuisine. I've dined in and had takeout and both experiences were great. Interior is clean and not very stylish, but cute. There's a small child's traditional outfit hung on the wall which I found to be charming.   My favorite dish I've had is the Bandejita Paisa. It's like a sampler of the menu, with steak, pork belly, chorizo, egg, plaintain, rice, beans, avocado, and arepa. The pork belly is beyond - very crispy but melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. I have eaten a variety of menu items and I can't get enough!!! The corn pancake with fried pork is UNBELIEVABLE! Their empanadas are unique and flavorful. Go there. Do it."}
{"text":"Amazingly good food. I cant say that I am an expert on Venezuelan food but I am definitely a fan now. We had passed by this place on the way between work and hotel and decided to look it up here on yelp and saw the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. I can say we will definitely be back regularly. There were three of us and all of the orders looked more delicious than the others and everyone was completely happy with what they tried. I look forward to exploring the menu in the coming weeks and months."}
{"text":"My trip here was completely accidental as I thought it was still a sub-par gyro shop and never even bothered to look it's way! I'm definitely happy I did though. The staff was extremely friendly, the menu was interesting and very unique for Madison, and most importantly - the food was ridiculously good.   I ordered the sweet corn pancake stuffed with homemade cheese and a side of yucca fries. It was served with two sauces and a pile of fried pork. This was easily enough food to feed 2 people but somehow I managed to choke down every last bite.  The yucca fries were crisp and flavorful and the sauces paired with them perfectly. The sweet corn pancake was absolutely unlike anything I had tried before and I could have easily gone for seconds. I wasn't in love with the pork, but not because it wasn't tasty, I just wasn't feeling it that day.   Overall, the meal was just incredibly satisfying, packed with flavor, and felt every bit as fresh and from scratch as they claimed it was.    This is one of those restaurants where I will definitely be returning to try more items on the menu. The only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but if I remember correctly they had decent lunch deals posted.   This may be my favorite new Madison restaurant!"}
{"text":"All of the yes!!!!!! This place is amazing.. Hands down one of my favorite authentic places to eat in Madison"}
{"text":"Flavor-town in my mouth is what Guy Fieri would say.  Seriously planned a 3 day vacation to Madison to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner dessert here everyday.... seriously... no guys SERIOUSLY. Didn't become BFF's with the friendly helpful staff :( they must of probably been embarrassed to see me 3 times a day as much as I was."}
{"text":"We love small, family owned places where the menu is unique and the owner makes an awesome recommendation. As we've never had Venezuelan food-we were pleasantly surprised with the taste, quality and speed. Wish it was closer to Milwaukee! Delicious, great presentation and affordable. Left fat and happy!"}
{"text":"This was my first Venezuela meal. I noticed on Yelp and was eager to try because of all the positive reviews. The staff was very nice and friendly to walk you through their food menu. Everything looked so delicious and I had a hard time on choosing one. I went for the popular item, Bandejita paisa. It was a HUGE portion. First of all, it had rice and beans at the bottom of the whole plate. Then steak, pork belly, an egg and avocado on top. It's basically like a sampler of everything, and everything tasted great! Should have tried the appetizers as well. I saw a few items ordered by the table next to me and they all looked yummy~"}
{"text":"This place was long due on our list ... Me and wife were very much satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food here... Great service, the waitress was kind enough to explain the whole menu and helped us make some good choices.... Felt the place was a little expensive, some may find it reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a couple different people. So we stopped by on a Monday night and ordered food to go. I ordered the Pabellon. I actually didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. The beef was shredded and flavored wonderfully. The plantains, even though are not a favorite of mine, were good. The beans and cheese covering them were excellent. A lot of food for the money and great quality.  I look forward to returning to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"Had the Arepa lunch with salad.  Great meal, fresh food, clean place,  great service."}
{"text":"This was an extremely clean delicious restaurant. It is smaller with limited parking but worth it ! Authentic , good prices. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a surprising place.  Out on a stretch of East Washington where everything's dingy, the interior gleams bright, colorful, and fresh.  You order at the counter, and the server is just as bright and lively - - and enthusiastically describes the menu and gives recommendations.  I asked someone chowing down what he was having, and he pointed it out on the menu and said that he had eaten there about a dozen times and was working his way through the menu, and loving everything.    While waiting for a friend, two of us had the fried yucca sticks and an arepa as a starter, and they were very tasty.   Trouble was, after that, we were both full!  Hearty (filling) tasty, distinctive food; great service (for counter-ordering eats!)  it is bright, colorful, clean (though has a bit of a fast-foody-feeling for a place with $11 entrees).  Try to avoid looking out onto East Washington if you can."}
{"text":"This place is the very epitome of a hidden treasure. Forget the \"Caribbean\" and \"Columbian\" tags. This is a full-on Venezuelan restaurant to the core. (Want to know the national bird of Venezuela? There's a picture of one on the wall...) We recognized almost nothing on the menu, so the manager (owner?) recommended the \"two most popular items on the menu\", which were the pabellon and the cachapa, which we supplemented with an arepa. All were wonderful. The gentleman also asked if we liked spicy food, because Venezuelan food *isn't* spicy, so... they make their own hot sauce from scratch for people who like it spicier. If you're heat tolerant, do yourself a favor and ask for some. When he brought it to the table he said \"Be careful\", and he wasn't kidding. This stuff is not for people who find Tabasco challenging.  If we lived nearby, this would definitely be one of our regular lunch places. And treating yourself isn't going to set you back very much either, with most dishes priced a bit over $10."}
{"text":"What a great find!! This place is a must. Authentic Venenzuelan/ Colombian food. Service is great. Bathrooms are clean. Ample parking space. Restaurant is clean with simple decorations. My favorite is the chicharrones with yucca fries. This is a must order. Also ordered the arepas which is great and huge servings. Their passion fruit juice is really good. I tried the tamarind juice but I prefer the passion fruit. I will definitely come back here again and try their empanadas and order the chicharoness appetizer again. They have a lot of great dishes to try but definitely I not miss the chicharrones. Trust!!!"}
{"text":"Areas which is a hot bummed if ground white corn with a crispy shell. You choose the filling. We had pulled pork and a shredded beef both with cheese. The offer other fillings but we had this previously and it was great. A favorite already.  We also had the Pabellon the Venezuelan national dish is black beans, white cheese, shredded beef, rice deep fried plantain (which was great) and arepita. We LOVE it!  Beer and wine alcohol only.   ++++service.  Counter service but the deliver. Cook to order. The owner is gracious, super friendly and helpful in guiding you. fast service too.   ++++ quality.  Food is outstanding and for the price. do I need to say more?    +++ ambiance smaller dinning room but clean with proper level of background music.   - small parking lot but there is street parking.  (But with food like this I'll walk a bit if I have to)  A must especially if you haven't had  Venezuelan food.  Oh and their soups look great."}
{"text":"First time here, and I was not disappointed. Large portions of delicious food, great customer service, and everything was made quickly and to order.   The black beans and rice and the queso frito were probably my favorite items from everything that we ordered, but everything was wonderful.   I'll definitely be back, and I highly recommend trying it out. Warning: they close fairly early on weekdays compared to some places, so get there by 6:30ish if you're expecting to have a super leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"My first time at a Venezuelan restaurant. Not being familiar with the foods, I asked the staff for ideas. I had the arepas and companion had a pork sandwich. Both of us were really pleased. We couldn't do better than that. The sauce was amazing. Companion doesn't like spicy and nothing was spicy on either of our plates. The arepas came with soup. It was a wonderful beef soup with vegetables.  Not overly salty with a rich flavor not much different than my own soups with the added bonus that  I didn't have to do the chopping.   Great flavors all around!   We will go back and try other things on the menu.  We want to see this place make it. The East Washington strip towards East Towne doesn't have a lot of independent restaurants. We miss the small restaurants that are simply devoted to food and not decor. This wasn't fancy and doesn't have table service but we were more than satisfied with our meals. There was no music blasting to drown out our conversation which seemed to consist of mmmmmmms and comments about the food. Try it!"}
{"text":"We tried the traditional appetizers and dishes. What amazing flavor with just spices and seasons no heat required to taste this amazing food. The look of the restaurant is very humble but with the lack of pricey decor comes even better quality food.  Nothing seemed to be reheated from a mass production, but instead was all made fresh here. This is a grate not found easily in this day of age and a absolute must try.  Neither of us had even heard of Venezuelan food but do they do it right. I feel like I left Wisconsin and traveled to South America."}
{"text":"The first time I went to la taguara I remember finding it a little bland, but I recently got some food there again with a friend and the pabellón was amazing. The beef was so so tasty. I do wish they'd give a few more plantains with the dish though - that's the best part! The empanadas are also very good; I think I will definitely be back to try out more."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was not that enthusiast when my friends were suggesting this place for a farewell dinner for two friends leaving the States for good.  Arriving at around 7 PM, this restaurant was empty and was still empty until we were done with our dinner. Don't get me wrong- the food is GOOD. My hubby and I ordered Yuca for the appetizer and we got to try the fried plantain and both are equally good. For us, it's like reuniting with our Indonesian taste, as we have the exact same dishes of Yuca, which is actually cassava. The way they serve it is the same way like we have back home.  We also had empanadas and pastellino. The empanadas were okay, but not the best.  Our friends had Pabbellon, which came a jumbo version. It can be shared with two to three people, in fact. And they all liked it! Overall, this place serves a good selection of food and I'm sure I'll be back for their Yuca Fritta!"}
{"text":"This place is really tasty and you get huge portions for not a lot of money. We had an appetizer platter, which is a great way to try several options. Everything on it was hot and delicious. We each also got an entree and everyone took food home! It was the biggest Cuban Sandwich I have ever seen. The people working there are really friendly. You order at the counter and then they bring it to your table. We got there just in time, after we ordered the line was out the door! My only minor complaint is beer in not cold enough. Other than that, this is a great place to eat or carry out from."}
{"text":"Highlights/Lowlights  1) amazing food! 2) gluten free friendly 3) very casual  This may now be one of my favorite lunch spots in Madison! La Taguara has awesome food at pretty reasonable prices. The cuisine is Latin American and Oh so good. Gluten free menu options are marked clearly on the menu and there are a ton of them.   The ambience is very very casual. I would say this is more of a lunch place or a quick dinner. You order at the counter, take a number and your food is brought out to you. You get your own silverware, soft drinks etc.   We had the pan fried white cheese appetizer that comes with this awesome pico de gallo type salsa. I had the chicken arepa and a side salad, and my friend had empanadas. Everything was awesome! The arepa \"bread\" is gluten free so you don't need to make any modifications to the menu option. The salad comes with this bright green dressing that is also awesome to dip the arepa in.   The staff is super friendly and answers all questions quickly and cheerfully. Stop in for lunch if you haven't had a chance to, it's a great spot!"}
{"text":"Passing through Madison and our family decided to let Yelp find a place to eat dinner. As usual, we were not disappointed! We especially enjoyed the Rompe Colchon and the Arepo de Pabellon, but everything was delicious and authentic!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is delicious!!   I had been meaning to check this place for quite some time now... I wish I had done so sooner! It was fantastic!   It's a small restaurant. The outside is super cute with flowers all over, and the interior is decorated nicely as well, with traditional Venezuelan decor.  For food, I went with the Pabellon a Caballo, while my boyfriend went with the La Taguara Burger. We also ordered an arapa with shredded beef and white cheese to share.   The Pabellon a Caballo was awesome. It was a lot of food, too. Definitely enough for 2 meals. It came with shredded beef, rice, beans, and a fried egg on top. Yum yum yum! I didn't try the burger, but I was told it was incredible. It was juicy and dripping with sauce, cooked perfectly. The arapa was also quite tasty. The shredded beef had such amazing flavor to it.. I could eat that alone with nothing else and be happy!   I also went with the passion fruit juice as my drink. WOW! That stuff is a must! So good!   I can't wait to return and try more off the menu! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Locally family-run.  The price is right with heap loads of food so you're not going home hungry.  The only negative is the parking lot is tiny. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Damn, La Taguara is so good. I live in Milwaukee, but 75% of my (infrequent) Madison trips include a stop here. I've recommended them to two separate friends who both agreed they lived up to my hype.  I'm guilty of being a repeat order-er here. Usually I'm not that type of person. But I get the Pabellon every time, I can't help it. I'm here so rarely and it's so good.  As someone who does not know Venezulean food, you get a nice variety of what it's about (and a lot of it). Their beef is juicy well seasoned perfection.   On my last visit, I finally ordered something new- the fish coconut curry. Holy moly, it was delicious. It was actually my first time ever having FISH curry, so.. it was a big day for me. Flavors were spot on. I loved the picadillo salad and friend plantains. Seriously, make a stop here. Go with friends so you can try as many delicious menu items as possible."}
{"text":"The first time I ate her the place was packed, and for good reason. They have amazing food, that taste as authentic as I imagine it can. It was a pleasure to eat this food, and I walked out truly feeling satisfied with what I had eaten. But my qualm with La Taguara is there lack of servers. Though it may work when they are not packed when the place gets congested a large line forms and it takes for ever to get your order in. But I felt as though the food lived up to the rush and was worth the wait."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at la taguara on Friday and it was amazing. We were greeted by an extremely enthusiastic owner who is clearly passionate about what he does. We then ordered his first two recommendations and we're not disappointed. Everything was delicious, we will be back!"}
