{"text":"They have the best rice cake, sweet chicken and Korean special soy sauce chicken. I'll definitely make a delivery from here again"}
{"text":"This is now my go-to WING place!  My wife saw the 2 for 1 wing deal so we decided to give it a try.  We normally go to such places as St. Louis or Fox and the Fiddle for their wing deals, but I think Dakgogi is now a wing contender.  The wings themselves are the normal size wings, not the monster wings at Fox (which I like too).  You get about 9 wings per serving, but what makes these wings stand out from the rest, the crunch and the tenderness.  The crispiness and the taste reminds me of Popeye's chicken, and the  moisture of the meat reminds me of Mary Brown chicken.  Perfectly cooked chicken, will definitely come back....maybe try some other dishes.  

Draw backs; the chicken was a tuch oily (very hot though!) the rave music was too loud, and the decor was dated.

Disclaimer: Must order a drink to get the 2 for 1, but didn't need to order a second drink  when I wanted an extra 1lbs.  I'm not Korean, but I know they perfected deep fried chicken"}
{"text":"Awesome environment. it's a good atmosphere to go with a couple of friends for Korean style chicken and beer. I ordered half chicken and it was very crispy and the sauce was very delicious. The order came out promtly as well. I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Our group of 10 was planning on going to St. Louis, but came here instead because of a long wait. And I'm so glad I did! The food was amazing! 

We ordered some different types of fried chicken (spicy, garlic?!), and spicy rice cake. Wow!! The chicken was flavourful and crispy. The service was great and we had such a good time there! 

I'd recommend for large groups. Make a reservation before you go!"}
{"text":"I had a lot of korean fried chicken but this one near north york area such as The Fry, Ahjukuh or something. The only thing I would say is that the place is decent. Other than that the food was less tasty than the ones at The Fry and Ahjukuh. 

Also, the service is absolutely way too slow..again, the place is pretty decent. To be honest the place is actually cleaner than their competitors but the service compared to other Korean Fried Chicken places it's horrifying. When I've asked for water I had to repeat myself 4 times before the waitress got me a glass of water without saying a thing. The place was half-empty and I ordered some fried chicken and it came after 35 mins of waiting.

environment is decent: 7/10
taste is nothing special and The Fry is better: 5/10
service is horrifying: 2/10

if you guys are looking to eat some good korean fried chicken try The Fry you will have a better experience there."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken extra spicy was not hot at all. Music was blaring and we could not hear ourselves speak. Did not like the atmosphere or service very much."}
{"text":"Supposed to go to St Louis but they have a super long line up. So we came here because of the half price wings for Monday and Tuesday. And surprisingly it's not bad! Typical Korean fried chicken style. Will definitely go for another time for the half price wings!"}
{"text":"There have been a lot of Korean fried chicken spots popping up all over Toronto, predominately in the Yonge and Finch area.  Dakgogi is by far my favorite place because it seems their recipe is spot on.  The chicken is crispy, lightly breaded, but not greasy.  It doesn't weigh you down even after a few beers.  The calamari fries and soft shell crab are nice as well.  Overall its a great environment to have dinner/snack and a few drinks.  Their beer specials are very decent as well.  Last time I was there they had live music and the vibe was bumping!"}
{"text":"*Plays Vitamin C's Graduation Song* \"As we go on, we remember, all the times we had together..\"
Dakgogi is not the same place as it used to once be. The quality and portion size of the food changed dramatically declined, favouritism is on clear blast for personal friends, and service has been always unappealing. Shame. It used to be so good."}
{"text":"Ordered  1/2 green onion fried chicken and  1/2 garlic soy sauce fried chicken as well as a ddokbokki for 4 people. Chicken tasted amazing, especially the soy sauce and garlic one! The batter is very light and the sauce wasn't very overwhelming. Ddokbokki was quite spicy, but was still very tasty otherwise."}
{"text":"Wait almost one hour for our food. The waitress just said their older machine doesn't work. Will not go there or recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Chicken & Beer!  That's what a Tuesday night consisted of with half price wings, and a pitcher of beer.  Came here with a large group of people (around 15) and the reservation was made well in advance.  The restaurant is not that big, so our group took up a large majority of space in the restaurant.  

Service: There weren't many servers so service was a bit slow.  Oddly they took orders from about 4 people at one end of the table, and then stopped.  Then they came around and took the remainder of the orders.  So several people had their food right away, while most of us waited.  One person didn't get their food until everyone had pretty much finished eating.  They had to remind the server more then once about their order to make sure it hadn't been forgotten.  At the end the bills were handed out per table, and not per person.   Not only that, but the bills were all wrong....  Our pitcher of beer ended up on one bill, while our wings on another.  A person who ordered a pint of beer all the way at the end of the table; their beer showed up on a completely different bill.  They had to re-do the bills 3 times, which if you ask me, it would have been simpler to just do individual bills from the beginning.  Since none of us had planned on sharing bills, we all had to dig deep and pull out cash and somehow sufficiently pay the bills.  I am slightly amazed that we had enough cash on all of us to pay the bills without getting change.  It truly was a disaster and we had to count and re-count a few times just to make sure we had sufficiently paid the bills.  

Food: By the time the food came I was far to hungry to take pictures... just dug right in!  We tried the medium and padak chicken wings.  The medium were saucy and the padak were dry which was nice to have the two different kinds. The medium spicy were actually spicy.  Some people in our group found them too spicy, but I found them just right.  The hot would have been way too hot.   The padak were nice, but not especially flavourful.  Crispy fries were served with each order of wings.

Restaurant: the staff seemed quite nice, if but a little overwhelmed.  The music was fun, but possibly slightly loud?  The restaurant was also packed so it got somewhat loud, but not too loud that you can't hear anyone.  There was some amazing paintings/graffiti done around the place whichi was really fun.

Overall: Glad I tried this place, but I probably wouldn't return.  It was a fun night, but beer and wings made me sleepy :)"}
{"text":"It's funny how people talk about service like they're going to a major franchise restaurant and then expect top-notch service.  People are never providing the full details of the situation.  As a very long time customer here, I only come because of a friend of mine and I know if I request free service on some small appetizers - I will definitely receive it.

The place itself is owned by a Korean.  His style is more Koreanized than it is Westernized - meaning that there are more Korean dishes on the menu (outside of chicken).  Dakgogi is the Korean word for chicken, and the name of this bar (obviously).  Their chicken is definitely above average, and they specialize in fried chicken.  What sets them apart from any other bar that serves chicken wings is that they seem less heavy and focus more on the seasoning/flavouring of the chicken itself versus simply tasting like a lot of oil.  I will say that as one who simply goes there to drink and rarely do I order something, the chicken is better than any bar that I have gone to in North York.

As for the service; it all depends on what night you go there. If you go there on a Tuesday night (which is likely half price wings day), remember that you're still visiting them on a slow night.  It's not like you're going to St. Louis across the street where they have the money and resources to provide faster and better service.  Not to mention, that they have to compete with several dozens of other bars around this area - the competition is fierce.  Their service is slightly better than other Korean bars.  They WILL be much slower if it's a busier night (i.e. Friday, Saturday) because they simply cannot keep up with the much younger crowd, who consist mostly of loud and obnoxious college kids.  

So, to recap...here's a better evaluation of what I personally judge this place:

Service: 3.5/5
Chicken: 5/5
Other Food: 3.5/5
Location: 3/5
Price: 4/5
Atmosphere/Environment: Irish sports pub, loud music in new Korea town. Weekends are typically visited by college/university students. 
Dress code: None
Amenities: Patio, Multiple big screen TV's usually on sports channel
Music: Mostly Korean

I have left my last review unedited for the reason that I am showing full transparency in this edited review.  I have now stopped going to this place due to the fact that my friends and I - all regular customers - were constantly double-charged intentionally; and our suspicion was that the owner encouraged his waitresses to do so.  The food was getting sloppy in terms of quality and creativity as time wore on.  In addition; I have had personal discussions with the owner about my personal dissatisfaction about the way he treated his regular customers and after 3 sit-downs with him, I realized that he could care less.  The only thing I have edited is my rating: 1 star."}
{"text":"We came here on a saturday night... actually stumbled upon it as our original restaurant choice was packed and we couldnt get seating for our party of 8. The food was good and as you expect... its a korean fried chicken place. The menu is rather limited but for what they offer its not bad... better to make a few things really good than a lot of items really bad! We ordered 2 orders. of the half/half fried chicken which is one group sized order of chicken with 2 flavours of sauce And kimchi fries, we tried padak (a green onion soy sorta flavour, sweet soy and their standard korean spicy sauce. All were good.. the chicken can be ordered regular or boneless... came out juicy and fresh. Kimchi fries were food, fresh fries, a home madei  sorta kimchi with a fried egg and mayo/sour cream drizzle on top. Bill was less than 100 bucks for 8 ppl, not bad at all. I dont usually crave korean and there are a lot of comparable places to this but this isnt a bad choice, 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The chicken pieces are tiny.  The special half-half chicken, (which is supposed to be one chicken split into two with two sauces of choice) suspiciously comes with only one chicken wing and one drumstick.

We had ordered two half-half specials and both only came with one wing and drumstick each, so I doubt it was a one-off.

The batter isn't fluffy.  The chicken is kind of dry.
It overall lacks any taste besides chicken and salt.

The salad is just shaved cabbage with a bit of thousand island or ranchy dressing drizzled over it. 

Did I mention that all this was at a rather steep $28?

The only thing sadder than this is the mental image of a one-winged, one-legged chicken running around before being made into this disappointing fried chicken. *tear*"}
{"text":"I ordered Korean fried chicken. The interior was about the same as the Turbo Lounge that was there before.
Aside from the mediocre service, The chicken pieces were overcooked and soggy. I might have had a bad batch, but they were certainly bad enough to leave a negative impression in me, and I don't think the restaurant deserves the 4-star rating. If you're looking for an authentic Korean-style fried chicken, I'd say The Fry does a better job. At any rate I'm not in any hurry to come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to bars.  Been going even when it used to be called Turbo Lounge. 
The place is quite cozy nd pretty dark inside. always best to make reservations. 
Whenever I go I always order their flavoured soju. Yogurt is the best!!  The others like strawberry, lime etc just taste like carbonated pop. 
In the last visit I went with a group of 7-8 friends. We ordered a few towers of beer and jugs of soju. The waitress ended up giving us a lot of refills on free apps. From what I remember, there was some corn, some chips, some peanuts etc. It was great service! 

There is parking in the back (green p I believe) or street parking is available. 

Price is mediocre. But they do have some food specials on certain days."}
{"text":"DAKGOGI G O D. 

Can I buy merchandise from this place? A t shirt? A LONG TIME CUSTOMER RETURNS TO LEAVE A REVIEW TO GET A $5 COUPON NEXT VISIT!! I LOVE korean fried chicken. The shitty part is in order to have a good time you splurge $30 on a whole half n half chicken. A bit pricey on a young hustlers pocket. Dakgogi brings those flavours with a TUESDAY SPECIAL to WINGS. That's right KOR CHICKEN WINGS, fries and a freaking BEER TOWER. 

Bomb ass fries & wings- I always go for the Tuesday specials as it's only around $9 after tax for fries&pound&pop - today I got four pounds with fries and drinks for 40$. That's right two pounds per person on that HUSKY WINTER BULK LIFE. Your boy tutorgary got the soy, padak, original and mild. 

Word of advice: MILD is spicy. Like I'm a normal person and it's hot for me. Be warned."}
{"text":"Not as good as The Fry and Home of hot taste.  Place is nicely decorated.  Server was very attentive and came to our table very often.  Got the Green onion & special sauce fried chicken and the Soy Garlic chicken.  The pieces were kinda smaller and it wasn't as crunchy as I liked."}
{"text":"Friends brought me to this small place that has the vibe of a cozy local bar, but features Korean fried chicken as their main meal. It's a little like stepping into a Chinese restaurant where everyone is Chinese except Korean version - from the crowd, decor, to the menu.

There's a number of combos and specials you can get, my party of five got a soy sauce with garlic fried whole chicken, a special half and half (padak and plain), and kimchi fries. To drink, we got a Sapporo beer tower. There was more than enough chicken to go around with good variety in the pieces, but the fries were disappointing. I can see myself being back for the chicken and the beer, just because the small space atmosphere suits me, and the only server there was nice and really did do her best.

There was some confusion about the food portion order, but that aside the chicken came hot and tasty. There was a bit of wait, but tolerable. The padak features a coverage of shredded green onion over boneless chicken - good for those lazy about bones. The plain was crispy and simple, adding a side of mayo sauce will cost you $1.50 though! Finally, the soy sauce with garlic - I could see the soy and see the garlic, but I couldn't really taste the garlic on my chicken. It was a bit of a letdown, but I did still enjoyed the sweet Korean soy sauce flavour. 

The kimchi fries were not as I expected however - it resembled McCain's freezer fried topped with mayo, a large dollop of kimchi, and a sunny side fried egg that was not runny - it didn't mix well and just sat atop the fries."}
{"text":"More chicken, save money! 

Enjoyed it, the only problem is the server moving too slow...  

It's okay honey! I think she talks too much in one table keeping the others wait....

Overall, good food! 
Say less!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Korea fried chicken, and I have to say this place didn't meet my expectations.

The service was okay here. Staff were nice and responsive, but won't bring your table any water unless prompted. Perhaps it was expected you would order beer here (since the vibe is more like a sports bar), but we had already ordered and received our food by the time we asked. It would be nice to at least get a round of water regardless (it's the classic soju branded water bottle + cups to pour it yourself).

Now onto the edibles.
Their complementary side dishes were...very bad. The pickled daikon tasted very stale--no daikon crunch, just sponge and surprisingly bland for a pickled food. The salad was over seasoned with a dressing that was confusingly salty. However, since they're complementary, I don't have too many issues with them, but it could be an indicator of quality.
We got the half & half chicken in fried chicken and mild yang nyum chicken flavours. This was hands down the most crunchless fried chicken I've had. It tasted like the type of fried chicken you try to make at home that confusingly doesn't end up crunchy after shallow frying, cools down, and is then microwaved to a slight sogginess. The chicken itself was quite dry--very little moisture, no flavorful and juicy fat to be found, perhaps due to being cooked to oblivion. I felt like there was more bone than chicken for a large majority of the pieces as well--I'm talking a 8-2 ratio of bone to chicken. However, the flavour of the chicken was still good...but I wanted FRIED chicken.

Probably will not be coming back again, especially with so many Korean fried chicken places all around the area, at similar or more worthwhile price points."}
{"text":"The chicken wings here aren't bad, but this place is absolutely not able to handle large groups. It's was half price wings on Tuesday ($6.50/pound) with a nice assortment of sauces. Domestic pitchers for $14.99. My order came pretty promptly but others at our table didn't get their orders the first time round. The bills were the true disaster. They told us we couldn't do separate bills, only by table. Except they ended up mixing up all the orders and it was just a big mess. The server re-did the bills several times to the point that 10-12 separate bills would have been so much easier. They also added an extra pitcher to our bill. 
I imagine they are fine for groups of four or less, but honestly there's better wing joints in the city. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Welcome to street parking and if you know Yonge street then maybe you can locate the closest Green P parking lot. Anyhow I did not drive and my friend could perform the parallel park, so woohoo! We actually wanted to go to St. Louis for half price wings but I was told by my friend that Dakgogi has a similar offer. Unfortunately I didn't pay so I can't really comment on the pricing of this place but I've been told it's not bad lols (worst reviewer ever). Anyhow I must be very foreign because I have never tasted corn in mayonnaise. I always knew Korean appetizers are amazing but this dish right here wins the gold prize. It's sweet, gooey, and chewy ... yes, it's the right combination for a bombtastic snack. First of all, it's on a heated plate so the corn is warm at all times baby. Next up is the kim chi fries and this might be better than the ones at Banh Mi Boys. It is HUGE. Unfortunately the wings were a disappointment, not only were the sizes small but the sauces were not original (e.g. no special kick to it or better yet, they taste like the chicken wings you would find in microwaveable dinners). I'd like to add that the hot sauce is extremely hot, to the point where my friend and I chugged down a glass of water and still felt our tongue burning. The place is quite busy on a Tuesday so don't expect service to be fast lols."}
{"text":"sad ...that I loved this place..must be new management or they got greedy...their price is super inflated. ..compared to last year...found out that they made half price wings..Tuesdays only..."}
{"text":"Korean fried chicken - this is why we came here.

I had organized for a group to come to Dakgogi for our 2nd get together for a KFC Unofficial Yelp Event.  About a dozen people showed up and I had made the reservation weeks ago but I had updated the reservation to add more than 10 just a few days ago.  The reservation was not an issue.  I arrived last (around 720 pm) as I was stuck in the subway longer than expected that wasn't an issue.

I had arrived embarrassingly late for my own hosted event.  Everybody was seated in a nice cluster near the front with tables put together so we had one long table for our large group.  The place is sort of tight and it's kind of impressive they are able to accommodate a party of our size with a fair bit of notice but it was greatly appreciated.

What was odd and unfortunately WAY off was the service.  I get that this place is busy and that Tuesdays are their special night (1/2 price wings) but I have to say there are some things that just made me think of how things could of been better because they were or became that bad.

 As I said I arrived last.  The entire table as far as I knew did not order, but the other end did however and they had food before our end even had a chance to ask for anything really.  I had ordered a drink that never came.  I had to ask our server again for it and it finally came then.  My end of the table finally got around to ordering and we were told they COULD NOT do separate bills but they could charge by 4's per table.  Technically I was at my own table of 4 by myself being as I was last and at the end.  

I ended up being included with the 4 besides me not really a big deal but my beer ended up on a table at the other end?  Billing was a disaster, just a complete disaster which could have been avoided if they bothered to bill everybody individually.  We were 12 people, not 15 as I had made the reservation for so 12 is not 50 individual bills.  I thought their unwillingness to give separate bills only added the frustration and confusion as to who ordered what and why was this on that bill for that table.  DISASTER.

The menu is the menu sure.  Wings are the special on Tuesday no problem.  The one stipulation which I completely do not understand is that you can order wings any way EXCEPT garlic soy.  I also experienced this phenomenon at Home of Hot Taste.  Is the secret ingredient for garlic soy platinum and diamonds and I just don't know it?  Why and by what logic can you order wings in ANY other flavor EXCEPT garlic soy which was what I was looking forward to? It made no sense but it was explicitly on the menu.  It's like trying to argue balls and strikes, you just can't do that.

Because of previous bad experiences of KFC in Toronto I've now come to the conclusion that if I want my chicken crispy and to remain crispy that I will have to ask for all my sauces on the side.  I am willing to do this.  I've now had KFC in 4 different cities in North America, 5 if you count Mississauga as not Toronto (Pittsburgh, NYC, Chicago and Toronto) and by far the 2 places I went to in NYC and Chicago each particularly know how to keep chicken crispy/crunchy while juicy on the inside and NOT dripping wet.  I'm speaking of Crisp in Chicago and Turntable in NYC.  All the others have been IMO way too wet and not crispy/crunchy because the sauce they drown the wings in makes them lose that.  I had almost felt like a diva asking for the sauce on the side but I had no choice after my last TO KFC experience had me picking up wings only to have them stream sauce like a honey pot dipper.  

Chicken wings:  GOOD but not special and 7 or so small wings with fries is regularly 13 bucks?  Regular price it's not a great deal.  Tuesday 1/2 price so basically 2 pounds (maybe about 14 to 16 wings about 13 bucks) for that price is not so bad.  I had a pint of Sapporo and it was 6.50.  Basically I left 25 bucks for my food and single drink.  I would have left 15% tip but the service was not good.  

To make things worse and this topped it all off besides getting all of our bills wrong was NOBODY had asked for the bills and all of the bills came to the table.  Is this their way of saying LEAVE?  I've never been given the bill without asking if we wanted anything else.  I was going to have another beer but I guess not as it seems they wanted us to pay.  The thing is we didn't leave right away.  The Jays game was on the tv and we were watching.  I didn't really feel they wanted us to order more because they gave us (all tables) their bills which were a jumbled mess that had to be asked to be fixed several times.

As people started to leave and our table began to thin out the remaining for asked to move to another table to consolidate so others could sit down.  I didn't see anybody waiting for tables but that's fair.  That table was eventually filled too which is cool.  

Overall the experience was poor and the food was good but the service was horrible.  

2* is me being nice."}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews, this place turned out to let me down. I was so excited when I learned I could get wings in Korean flavors. Even though I came on a Monday where I can get half price wings, I felt disappointed. 

The wings come with chips instead of the usual fries. I would have preferred fries much more. The wings themselves were kind of small. They also aren't crispy enough to my standard. I was expecting it to be more like Korean Fried Chicken. I probably should have ordered the yang nyeom flavor but we went with honey garlic and padak instead. The padak didn't feel special.

Also, we got a pitcher for $15. If we talk about prices, the regular prices aren't that good. Wings are regularly $13/lb which is slightly high. I didn't like how we were charged $1 for each lb of wings for sauce. I thought sauce should already be included in the price. If you look at other things on the menu, prices in general are slightly high. The value isn't here. 

I have no complaints about the service or decor (I almost never do anyways). It's a typical Korean place blasting Korean pop songs in a kind of bar environment.

I'd rather get the wing special at St Louis across the street or Wild Wing just 5 mins up.  The Fry is better too."}
{"text":"Ordered the green onion chicken and spicy rice cakes. 
The green onion chicken was fried nicely, crispy batter. I never had green onion with my chicken before and the two together is a great taste! The chicken were boneless, covered with a sweet sauce topped with loads of green onion.

The spicy rice cake was very spicy for me (I can only handle little spice) but my friends enjoyed it a lot. The side dishes (pickled radish and radish with a dressing on top) washes away the oiliness of the chicken and helped reduce the burning sensation of the spicy rice cake.

They have some combo deal for chicken and beer (chicken and pint deal) that i've seen a couple of tables got. Service was ok, it was only one server that night."}
{"text":"Good as always!! I reheated it at home so its in tin foil 

Service: Polite and Fast
Taste: Needs a little more salt, I got sweet sauce and its sweet not like plum. More marinating would be nice with salt, soy, mirin or wine
Price: Pretty spot on, they give you sides as well, and its not a chain restaurant. 
Ambiance: really loud lol, but so is every restaurant down the street

I do agree that the past recipe is a lot better, when i first had it. I loved it so much i recreated the recipe at home and it does taste better so I might just make my own next time. I hope i will come again though."}
{"text":"A little pricey but good chicken. Nice casual atmosphere. Not too loud. Yogurt soju cocktail was nice."}
{"text":"It was my first time at dakgogi yesterday. I came here around 630 last night, not too crowded. We sat by the open window which was nice. We ended up ordering half original fried chicken and half fried chicken with the sweet sauce, along with two pints of Sapporo. Our side dishes came first, it was the usual corn and salad with mayo. I can definitely say these side dishes are on the smaller side as oppose to the fry. 

I found the original fried chicken very crispy, not too dry either. Same with the chicken in sweet sauce. I'm not sure if prices are similar but our total price before tip was around $45. I'd comeback again if I want to go to a different kfc place, and service wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Usually I go to St. Louis on Tuesdays for 1/2 price wings. This time I decided to check this place out instead. I'm so glad that I did so!

I was going to order the hot wings but the waitress told me that they are too hot so I changed my order to honey garlic.

Wings are lightly breaded, fresh, and delicious. Comes with a side of light, crispy fries. Beer was flat. Non-smoking patio if you feel like sitting outside. Friendly service.

Worth checking out on Tuesdays for wings. Next time I will try out a whole chicken."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. The atmosphere is good, but sometimes the music is questionable. The chicken is super delicious (mild is actually spicy) and their Kimchi fries are a must! Keep in mind that the servers are Korean and you have to call them if you want service, they will only sometimes check up on you. Other than that, they are friendly."}
{"text":"Dakgogi has gotten seriously downhill. Their service has gotten from bad. To absolutely terrible. Avoid this place at all cost i would say. We were here on a tuesday and the servers were rude. And on top of it liars. We saw a booth and asked for it. And they refused claiming it was reserved. Afterwards another group came in and asked if they can get a table for 4. And they immediately gave them the same reserved table. Basically they want to cash in as much as possible. On top of it they refused to provide the basic side dishes they provide everyone for free. Usually at my previous two times of arrival. The food itself has gotten bad too. As they burnt the wings they fried. And on top they got the order wrong multiple times. For a 2 person table. Both waitress were like this so it was not just one bad waitress. They were never great on service but its gotten so bad. And the food takes so long to arrive its inexcusable. For a fried chicken place. I suggest everyone just go to the many other available fried chicken places in the area. And never come here. As your basically paying to be treated like crap. And given bad food"}
{"text":"Great place for casual drinks and half price wings on a Tuesday! The music is always on point and they even have green grape soju!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Korean fried chicken restaurants. 

Atmosphere - The bar itself has far better lighting than other Korean fried chicken restaurants so that you can actually read the menu. It isn't cramped and there are tv's around if you want to catch a playoff game. It's quite vibrant with Korean music blaring from the speakers.

Food - Best Kimchi Fries in the the city. There's something magical about the combination of hot Costco-like fries with a runny egg and kimchi. I always crave this.  I definitely recommend ordering this. 

Fried chicken wise, the Padak fried chicken is amazing (but they are boneless though if you don't like that). The sauce really adds to the flavour. We also got Mild fried chicken which was a bit spicy. I'd definitely recommend the Padak fried chicken.   

Beer - They also have beer towers which is awesome even for just the novelty. They have a pretty average selection of beer and the soju is a bit overpriced. 

Overall, I will return in the future and definitely recommend the kimchi fries and Padak chicken wings."}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken, since that's what they are supposed to be known for. I think it was pretty good. Not the best, but good, and they are in a good location for if you want dessert somewhere else after. 

I think people can agree that the food is pretty good/decent, but my main gripe is the service. 

It took a couple tries to get the attention of the server just to get some water with our meal. It also took a couple tries just to get the bill. It is kind of frustrating when someone takes your order, gives you your food, and that's the last you see them. I'm pretty sure it was a different server that brought the food too. I went during a time where the place was pretty empty too, so I would hate to see when it gets busy. 

I don't think it should require flailing your hands around to get the attention of the server - especially since the place isn't all that big. Please stop using your phone, doing whatever, when there are customers that need something. I'm not trying to be critical, but if you are working in the service industry, don't be on your phone! 

Overall, I liked the food, but just not the service. I'm mixed on whether I will try again, since there are so many options in the area."}
{"text":"I tried the Padak fried chicken and the Kimchi fries with spicy pork. They were huge portion sizes and between the two of us, we can barely finish. Definitely will be coming again!"}
{"text":"I've been there many times either on the patio or inside. If you have a chance, make sure you spend time on the patio on a nice warm day with some beer and Korean fried chicken. 

The patio is at the back away from the busy Yonge street traffic so it's enjoyable compared to other patios nearby. Alternatively, the inside of the restaurant needs a major reno and should get rid of the booths to make room for more tables and a spacious experience.

As for the food, they have a wide variety of flavors for their fried chicken. You can order plain, spicy or with soy sauce. On Monday or Tuesday,  they offer half price wings specials. On regular nights, take advantage of their chicken and beer combos for those who enjoy a drink or two.

No need for reservations but definitely get there early on a nice day if you plan to enjoy their patio of paradise."}
{"text":"Please refer to my previous review, because that information still remains true. I have not been having good experiences at dakgogi every time I've been back, and that's a lot. My heart always wants to give it a second try since it used to be so good. Even the owner or one of the workers had sent me a yelp compliment telling me to come back and try again because the experience I had last was 'when they first opened' so the service was bad.. that's not a excuse, but sure..?

We came back for a UYE the other day and that was the last straw. Service was minimal, if not none. The girl barely attended to our table and somehow half our table had already put in their order and received their food when the other half had not even put in drink orders. Ridiculous. The servers looked flustered with every interaction they made with our table and even when they brought the wings over, they looked very annoyed as we had trouble figuring out who ordered what flavour. It also took over 10 minutes to refill our bottles of water. Excuse me, do you want dehydration at this table? Or people dying from spiciness? Please. The menu has also gone downhill.. it used to be so extensive with pages after pages and offered combos. I guess their main focus now is the chicken. Their chicken is amazing and is one of my favourite korean fried chickens in Toronto. However, it's not good enough to keep me coming back. ALSO: BIG TIP- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DO NOT GET THE CALAMARI. It used to be SO good but I don't know what made them change the menu because it's now dry, hard and tasteless. The squid part comes straight out of the fried part and that's disgusting. Last time I ordered this, we could barely finish it. Waste of money. Their large yogurt soju is now $20.. dude, do you know how absolutely dirt cheap it is to make yogurt soju? Yes, it's my favourite korean alcoholic drink but it's definitely NOT worth that much. 

Also.. no splitting bills. The waitress said the best she can do for us is split it by table. Kind of weird, but ok? Honestly, any restaurant can split bills for you if you ask beforehand ..(all they have to do is put in a new order # for each person) it's just a matter of whether they want to or not. In the end, it was very confusing because they messed up our bill 3 times and we repeatedly had to keep telling them that something was wrong. I'm pretty sure it would've been easier if they had just split the bill for us.

Overall.. don't think I'd be coming back here soon.. dakgogi, you know I always have a small love for you.. but this is not the place to go for cheap wings and alcohol like it used to be."}
{"text":"Really good chicken! Best chicken I've had, and I've tried a lot of places. I always order the half and half, half fried chicken and half spicy."}
{"text":"Came back later on, was...alright. I wasn't too impressed with it the last time I went, but still alright to hang out. Their quality really varies."}
{"text":"There seems to be an issue with this place accommodating large groups.  They don't do separate bills.  I expect if you don't do separate bills but bill by table you at least get the bill right.  3 times and you're out.  And yes that's how many times they had to re-do the bills and they still weren't right.

Tuesdays get busy since it's high price wings.  Ordered a pound of hot wings and half if the fried chicken with padak sauce since we wanted something crispy.

Hot is a nice tingly hot - I could only eat a few before my lips were burning.  The crispy chicken was nice and crispy and not dry.  Didn't particularly care for the sauce (mix of soy sauce and green onions).

Service was fast for some people at our table and incredibly slow for others.  One person had to ask 3 times for their meal.

Music is the club vibe in here so get ready to here some tunes from a few years ago.  You can bounce in your chair to the beat while gnawing on your wings :)

Half price is a good deal.  I wouldn't pay full price for what you get.  Also while this place is busy there is still room to get a table.  We could see St.Louis across the street where there was a massive line up all night.

Grab a pitcher, some wings and just chill with your friends here gossiping all things Yelp :) 

300th review!!  Whoo- hoo"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! 

I wasn't sure about this place because of the hit-or-miss reviews, but we had a great time!

The kimchi fries ($11) are excellent and great for sharing. It is topped off with a Sunnyside up egg...whaaat?! The super salty and sour kimchi combined with crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside Costco fries and creamy mayo and sour cream was a very tasty combo. Their beer is cold and most importantly, not watered down like some of the other places around this area!

The only thing was they had the Leafs playoff game playing, but k-pop in the background because apparently their TVs don't play sound. Strange combo but that's fine, we still got to watch and eat good food.

Seems like a great place to hang out and have a snack after work but not a great place to watch the game if you're looking for a sports-bar type of atmosphere.

Will definitely be back to try some more food!"}
{"text":"Really authentic. More of a snack place you can come with friends for beer and fried chicken. Wouldn't make a meal out of it since it's so much fried chicken and their menu items are just okay."}
{"text":"Really liked the soy garlic chicken at Dakgogi but I was way too full to eat all of it - had to pack it away. EDM and hiphop music was blasted like they used to at Turbo (previous owner? or maybe it's still the same owner?).

Service was okay. Will come back to try more things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Great place in my opinion. Free parking always behind the sex shop and mezza Notte. Kimchi fries is life. Chicken is good and the sausage dishes are fantastic when your lit. Loool. Overall this place is amazing to me. Waitresses are nice af. Never had a bad experience here so that's just me and I come here like 2 times a week."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend of mine in early September at 9 in the evening. We had to wait five minutes before we got seated
I had the padak fried chicken and kimchi fries. I wasn't a fan of the kimchi fries because I have a preference for cold kimchi rather than warm. The fried chicken, on the other hand, was pretty great! These two dishes are enough to satisfy two people.

The restaurant is also a bit loud. It is also in a good location to grab a snack right after."}
{"text":"Really good place ~~~ Good food and good service. The food here is really good. My favorite foods are with bones tho. And it is all the time really busy, which means it is really popular all the time."}
{"text":"So slow. Even with the restaurant only half full, the food took so long to arrive. The drumstick and wings were good.  All the other pieces were dry or not that flavourful. Don't know why I came.  No wonder the restaurant was only half full on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is was just opposite to st Louis which is a great place for wings ... Being at this location and still be able to run the business describe this place ... So they good and very unique I will it is one of the best Korean wings I had ... As the wings they serve are fried which is what makes them special from st Louis .  I will definitely come here again as the prices are good come Monday or Tuesday for the half price wings that is what I will suggest."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is great!! Service can be a bit slow but the food is always excellent! Nice and spicy the way I like it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while. We finally got a chance to go tonight. It was a great atmosphere, loved the music, great fun upbeat bar vibe. We ordered beer, soy garlic half chicken and kimchi fries. The waitress brought me the wrong beer to start. Brought my boyfriend a water about 20 minutes later. Other tables filled up after us and yet got their food before us. Finally, we had to ask for our food after about 45 mins (we were told they were still making it), and magically it came within 5 minutes after that. They had clearly forgotten about us. The chicken was yummy, but the kimchi fries were pretty bland unfortunately. It's always disappointing when you really want to like a restaurant, but the service detracts from it. Too bad."}
{"text":"You gotta love chicken wings first before venturing here. Its like the korean version of St. Louis wings. I tried a pound of wings with honey garlic and the popcorn chicken with corn. Both dishes were tasty and a good portion size. I wish there were a few more fries though :P 
The service was on point but some of the staff arent exceptional in English. This is just a minor point. It has a nice vibe with a lot of people drinking and eating. Atmosphere is kinda a mix between a bar and a pub. Washroom is downstairs and I believe there is parking in the back somewhere. I would check out the Tuesday specials next time! Cheers. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"I came with a group of Yelpers for a UYE.  I ordered a plain half chicken with sauce on side, hot wings (1 lb) and a beer.  Beware of the \"hot\" level, as the hot wings were very hot.  The half chicken was crunchy and fresh, though it was a bit dry.  I noticed that the chicken was completely flavourless, meaning it was not marinated before batter coating.  I didn't see a salt shaker on the dining table.  Therefore, if you wanted flavour, your options were to order a sauce on the side or use ketchup.  Other than beer, all the alcoholic beverages were over priced.  Chicken wings were grossly over priced at regular price ($14).  We got ours half price because it was a Tuesday.

Services was okay at time of ordering.  It went downhill from there.  It took a long, long time for the food to arrive.  The guy sitting across me didn't get his order of beer pitcher even after all the food had arrived.  He was so upset.  The billing was a total embarrassment.  Our bill was charged for an extra beer pitcher."}
{"text":"Dakgogi is a small local Korean bar that serves flavourful food at an affordable price! 
It is an absolute gem and I am unsure why it doesn't get the publicity it deserves!
The menu is heavily focused on chicken and alcohol with a small selection of other food items.
Although their menu isn't as large as other places, it does serve great food that will leave you wanting more! 
It's a good place to hang out with friends and it is always at capacity whenever I come by. 
Similar to other places that serves chicken, they give you an option of how you want your chicken to be made. You have a choice of different sauces for your chicken along with chicken served with a dry rub. You are able to request sauces that are sweet, mild, or hot and you can choose your portion size (half chicken or whole).
My personal favourite is chicken served in Korean spicy sauce.
Another highlight is their kimchi fries with bulgogi. 
Served with an egg, it is a big portion that is great to eat with friends. A highly recommended item to order!
Service is great as they come by frequently to make sure all needs are met and they are also quick in taking action.
This is definitely a must try for those of you who haven't been here yet!"}
{"text":"So we can here for a uye the other day and wow. Lets start off with the menu. The prices are more expensive and it seems a bit smaller. The portions also seem a bit smaller from what i remember whenever I ordered wings. The deal is still the same for half off wings on Monday Tuesday. The wings still taste good so thank god for that. They also used to give you some free starters as the mayo corn or celery sticks and macaroni. None of that in sight as I sat down. 

The service however was quite bad for us. We couldn't get separate bills, fine. So the person did it by tables and that's fine. However we were given our bills when no one had asked for them, which is VERY RUDE. Then when we got our bills they weren't even right. Our table was missing a beer that was on the other tables and it took her 3 times to get the bills for our 3 tables right. I know on nights they can be a lot busier so this to me is unacceptable on the service and bringing the bill without us asking. Some of us were planning to get another pound of wings, but I guess you don't want our money anymore."}
{"text":"My go to Korean fried chicken joint. The food is always good and they have the best kimchi fries I've ever tasted. The servers are friendly, but just make sure you call them because they are always at the front. They also have half price wings on Tuesdays, which come with fries. You can't beat the price and portions."}
{"text":"Omg, Its the third Korean fried chicken restaurant i have this month. 

Taste:
The taste of the fried chicken is just right for my preference. The medium spicy chicken is sweet and spicy, which is just right for me. The soy garlic chicken has enough sugar and salt to make it taste just right. Compare to the Fry, and the House of Hot Taste, the taste at Dakgogi is definitely better.  

Appearance:
I got to say the appearance of the chicken is great. It using the soy garlic chicken as an example, the texture of the coating looks perfect.  The one at The Fry looks so dry, and the colour of the chicken at House of Hot Taste looks a bit too light.

Texture:
Home of Hot Taste's has more garlic and more crispy compared to Dakgogi.  Although, Dakgogi's seasoning on the coating taste a bit more powerful , which is my preference, if it has bit more juice and moisture would be perfect.

Both Dakgogi and House of Hot Taste have great fry chicken that are competitive to each other. If I need to choose one, i would choose House of Hot Taste, only because i weigh the texture of the chicken more than the taste of the coating and seasoning."}
{"text":"A coworker and I planned on going to St Louis to try the half price wings. The wait was long the hostesses were rude and disorganized so we left. Just across the street we went into this place. We were seated right away even though it was busy. 

The food was great (they also have half price wings on Tuesdays) nice good size wings not like st Louis which looked like tiny frozen ones. Great sauce and dry options,) with a boisterous young crowd!

If you are in the area and are craving wings forget St Louis and try out this place instead. I'll be back next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Nice place!! This place used to be called Turbo.

We were Bar hopping and came here after having drink across the street at St Louis.

The chicken here is delicious! Fries were great too!! Bar was fully stocked!! More so then other smiles sized Korean drinking spots!

Waitresses were really friendly.. had a few tvs, just enough..

Would come back here and recommend the Asian Bar food. But wouldn't come here to watch a game.."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends to eat fried chicken. It was not as great as popeyes, and only slightly better than kfc. 
Ordered whole chicken but for some reason, only one chicken breast was given to us. What kind of chicken has one breast?
For a korean beer and fried chicken experience, i suggest asking your korean brethen for a better place or if you do not have any korean friends, i suggest going either up or down yonge and asking around. Heck you might even make a friend or two."}
{"text":"Arrived at this chicken joint and only had their kimchi fries. I wish I had tried the chicken as well, but I was honestly more sleepy than hungry after our first round of dinner and drinks (and I doubt the group I was with could finish an order of chicken). Plus, Korean fried chicken goes darn well with beer, however at that moment I just couldn't intake any more alcohol, so we all just agreed on the kimchi fries. 

My goodness, I've only ever had fries with kimchi once previously, but it also came with globs of goat cheese, which personally ruined the taste for me. The kimchi fries here comes topped with a fried sunny side up egg as well as drizzles of mayo. You have the option of adding grilled pork for an additional $3. We just opted for the kimchi fries and it was so dang good. I love that such simple ingredients can make an eating experience so memorable. 

P.S. They do not take card for orders less than $20. Or maybe they do, but will charge an additional fee?

P.P.S. Sorry to whoever had to clean up the spilled water from our table. We left a generous tip! :)"}
{"text":"Reading reviews here looks very hit or miss.  I came here for the first time recently and luckily it was pretty good.  Ordered half and half, it came within a reasonable time. Quality was good, chicken was fresh and moist.  Still good the next day after we had to take some to go.  Even the white meat was good.  Kimchi fries were good, interesting dish.  Saw the Raptors game and it was a good atmosphere.  Negatives were its a bit pricy for fried chicken and fries but once in a while its okay."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming to this restaurant since high school, when it used to be called Turbo Lounge. Unfortunately, this place seems to have really dropped in their food quality and their customer service. First of all, their chicken was so dry and when we asked for sauce the waitress was reluctant to give us any. As well, most of the chicken pieces were mostly deep fried breading - including 2 neck bones pieces with no meat all - definitely not worth $26.99. The kimchi fries which I used to love eating, was really disappointing (very bland and the sauce was so oddly distributed - ex. a huge glob of mayo and a spoonful of kimchi thrown on top). In addition, my friend waved over the waitress, and we watched her walk back and forth (literally a cm away from my friend) outwardly ignoring her 5 times!! As well, not sure why they decided to blast their music like it was a club to the point where people had to shout to hear the person right across them. There were so many noisy tables (ex. people banging tables and girls screaming), and they did nothing about it. Lastly, even after this terrible experience, the waitress asked our table to leave to accommodate other customers - oddly enough there were a few empty tables, and we had a bill over $80. I definitely do not recommend this place - you are better off going to The Fry or Crazy Wings, where they had much better chicken and customer service!"}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are definitely a highlight!! The Korean fried chicken is was good though nothing special. Our order was a bit dry - we got the Padak and soy garlic. The special half and half basket was a bit smaller than I expected. Service was helpful, no major complaints but would say home of hot taste is slightly better. I went for Tuesday half priced wings but that only applies to the wings and not to the other fried chicken items."}
{"text":"We got Half and Half Chicken deal. We chose plain fried and Korean hot spicy flavours. Warning: Korean hot spicy is pretty spicy, especially when it is just served and it is hot. My friend loved it but I found it a bit too spicy for my taste. The portion was good; we were full by the end of the meal. They gave us a mustard sauce to go with plain fried chicken. They also gave us as appetizers, pickled white radish and chopped cabbage with a sauce that was a mixture of ketchup and mayo. 

This place looks a little shabby from the outside. It is a sports bar with booths and tables. They brought their menu on a clipboard. Their menu does have English translations but in much smaller fonts than in Korean so you might want to take your Korean friend there for translation and better service. ;) Dak-gogi literally means chicken meat. As their name suggests, they only sell chicken. They also have quite a selection of domestic, imported, Korean and Japanese beers as well as some grapefruit beer.    

If I were to choose which Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) tasted better, I like K-pocha in Mississauga, Home of Hot Taste in Thornhill and The Fry at Sheppard and Yonge, North York more than this place, Dakgogi."}
{"text":"If you're up for a nice snack that's both delicious and extremely spicy, I HIGHLY recommend their spicy chicken feet. It has a gochujang-based sauce and comes packed with a fiery heat.  Although many friends of mine aren't fans of chicken feet, they're a personal favourite of mine! 

We got this dish accompanied with the seasoned rice, which really helps with the heat. I love the mixture of seaweed and mayo in my rice. The rice was highly addictive!"}
{"text":"came here with 7 other friends.
here is what we ordered:
Deep Fried Chicken with Green Onion and Special Sauce. Whole.
Spicy Chicken / With Cheese
Chicken Salad
Not too sure about the last one, but might've been the Special Half & Half.

This was quite a bit of food for the 8 of us but we did manage to finish everything. Aside from the sauces and toppings that came with each order, i felt like the chicken itself was pretty lacking. maybe didn't have much seasoning to them on it's own, or wasn't marinated well. But they tasted a bit dry/bland.

Deep Friend Chicken with Green Onion. The flavour that stood out the most was the green onions and that was only if you actually ate them. There wasn't much of a punch to this dish without it.

Spicy Chicken / With Cheese. Was a bit dry. Served on a hot plate, so not deep fried. Wasn't overly spicy for me, I only had 2 pieces because I don't do too well with spicy foods, but the level of spice was decent. If i ate more i probably wouldn't be able to handle it. Either way I don't really like chicken breast and even more so when it's dry.

Chicken Salad. I probably liked this one the most. Really, it was a simple dish. lettuce, tomatoes, dressing, and fried chicken cut into slices. I think the sauciness of the dressing was a big factor because I don't like dry chicken.

The Half & Half. Only had 1 piece of chicken from this. If i have the right order named, this had drumsticks and other pieces of chickens with bones. All the other orders above were boneless. Again, not too much to say about this one, I don't even remember the flavour of the sauce on this one.

Verdict. For fried chicken, this is not going to be one of my top options."}
{"text":"Came back after their renovations. We didn't know that the place opened at 4:30pm but the waitress kindly let us sit down at a booth while we waited. I like to go there during their Tuesdays 1/2 off wings deal. It comes with 1/2 a potion of wings and the other half of french fries. The catch to this deal was that you also have to but a soft drink in order to get the promotion on the wings. The spicy pork kimchi fries are still as delicious as the last time I got it a few years back, hot and crispy. The interior looks more spacious, I think they changed the tables and chairs. Service was good, the waitress kept coming back to ask if everything was ok. One of my favorite places to go to for fried chicken, the options for sauces are A+!!!! Even though one of the sauces is \"mild,\" it still has a bit of spice to it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here when it was Turbo Lounge and T-Lounge! Their service was superb with AMAZING prices. Food was good and drinks were cheap! They underwent several name changes and I believe Dakgogi will remain. 

They made over their menu and somewhat renovated the interior. It appears that they are doing better than ever! Every time when I come here on a weekday, this place it quite filled! On the weekends... this place blows up! There are 4 booths that's perfect for 4-5 people and 4 long tables. They also have a patio at the back! 

Service was HORRIBLE the first few times visiting after changing its name and management from T-Lounge to Dakgogi. The servers were NOT ATTENTIVE AT ALL. There were a couple of instances where my friends and I had to physically get up, walk over to the bar and place our orders. Also, they overcharged us, gave us the wrong change or did not give us any change back at all! Just make sure to ALWAYS check your bills prior to paying!! 

I did my birthday here last year with a group of friends and as you know, we all got overly excited with our drinking games... so, a server came up to us to tell us to quiet down. Pardon me? Last time I checked, this was a BAR/LOUNGE not a LIBRARY. I was quite disappointed with the service and I told myself that I will not be visiting again...however, I still bring myself to this establishment today and I have to say, they improved A LOT. BRAVO!

The degree of customer service is A WHOLE LOT BETTER than my earlier visits. Staff were more attentive and identifiable. They now have uniforms; all servers wears a black t-shirt with DAKGOGI printed on it. I've had their fried chicken wings a couple of times and it was great! Lightly battered and salted and just deep fried to perfection! If you like honey garlic, beware! Their honey garlic sauce will disappoint you... ): As for drinks, market price for beer and I believe they've increased their prices on the Soju Yogurt/other cocktails. Nonetheless, it's still a nice place to hang and have drinks with a group of friends! Although it'd be nice to have complimentary dishes again..."}
{"text":"This was a pretty typical Korean place. It was loud and vibrant. The food was decent. It made you feel full pretty quickly but hungry again shortly after. I think prices were pretty decent. With 1.5 chicken and the dry plate and two pitchers of beer amongst 4 people, bill came to about $40 a pop. It was a small and cozy place. I would come here again. Oh! Side note, the dry plate wasn't really worth it, so save your money"}
{"text":"3 Star + 0.5 for having 1/2 price wing special on Tuesdays!

Tuesday 1/2 Wings with purchase of a drink and Raptors Game 5! 

We ordered 2 orders of wings (Mild and Spicy). I like how crispy the fries was and how spicy spicy was. Because of the spiciness, my 2 friends opt out and I ended up eating the whole order by myself... Sweet!

Padak Half Chicken Boneless. You better love green onions. I do wish for more green onions and a little more sauce. But it was quite delicious. Some pieces were a little dry because I do prefer dark meat.

The side dish were so so aside from the pickled radish. The salad was drown in Thousand Island Sauce and the peanuts was stale. Just a note, if you order Wing Specials, you won't be getting any side dish.

When we walked in, all tvs were showing Blue Jays! We asked the waitress can the channel be changed to Raptors Playoff game, she said it would be fine but I need to tell her what channel?!"}
{"text":"TUESDAY WING SPECIAL.

This place made me question getting wings anywhere else on a Tuesday night because it's SO good here. Korean Fried Chicken is already amazing to begin with, but top that off with extra flavours and WINGS, it's even better. On tuesdays, wings are 50% off with a purchase of a drink (cheapest drink is $2). The 1lb of wings also come with a lot of (costco?) fries. We only finished half of our portions and packed the rest. It came to about $10 AFTER tax. 

The service is a little slow, so it might not be the best place to go if you're in a rush or you're super hungry, but if you're ready to wait a bit for cheap and delicious korean fried chicken wings, then go here! It was almost empty around 6:30PM when we went but at 7PM the place was packed. 

I want to try their kimchi or bulgogi fries when I come back! There's also an outdoor patio area that I didn't get to check out. I heard they renovated recently so it looks way better than it used to too.

GIVE THIS PLACE A SHOT."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going o Dakgogi on a Friday night.

I showed up around 7pm and there were a few tables still available for dinner.

This place has a grungy hole-in-the-wall feel. The music is definitely bumping in here. A great place to  grab a casual drink with the guys, or to catch a sports game, but bot as great if you want to have a long serious conversation. It's just too loud.

Dakgogi serves Korean fusion food and it was definitely tasty.

I recommend the Kimchi fries and the Green Onion soy sauce fried chicken. For the latter, I liked the fact that the fried chicken was boneless chicken breast -- it was battered like the chicken found at Popeys . The Kimchi fries was on the next level with a fried egg on the top. That was a nice touch.

I would definitely go again.

PRO TIP: Don't get the spicy chicken wings unless you're in for a real scorcher, this stuff is spicyyyy!"}
{"text":"Came here for their monday/tuesday special. Got a pound of wings and fries for half price with a purchase of a drink. 
Coke $2.00
Wings $6.50 (12.99 originally)

I got 3 pounds- padak, medium and honey garlic !! All the flavours were delicious and the wings were SUPER crispy. My favourite flavour was padak.. kind of a sweet soy saucey flavour. I normally dont like fries in general but dakgogi's fries were SO CRISPY outside and fluffy inside.. Yum. I actually enjoyed this much more than The Fry (another korean fried chicken resto).

Our server was also very helpful and friendly as well. Great service. 

Definately coming back!"}
