{"text":"Unbelievable good Thai Food. Correction the Name is taste of Thailand.
If you haven't been yet ? GO ! If you love Thai Food- It is very authentic down to the utensils and the Serving dishes- but most important the Food is OUTTA THIS WORLD.
Awesome service- seriously could not have been better.
Don't forget to try vegetable dishes . It so delicious ,specially (PAD THAI TOFU & TOFU CURRY)"}
{"text":"The Thai food here just keeps getting better and better. The first two times we ordered weren't amazing and the sauces were heavy but the last order was extremely good. Spring rolls, Basil beef, green curry and pad Thai all to delicious perfection! Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"The food is good (maybe even a little better than most), but that difference is not worth the price difference.
Pad Thai for $16.74 for LUNCH take-out is too expensive! It's basically noodles and tamarind sauce...with a reasonable amount of chicken pieces and 3 shrimp.  No tofu and a little egg.
Yes, I should have asked how much it would when I ordered; lesson learned!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, it was nice inside and very clean. I was greeted with a smile and the service was good.  I had the seafood stirfry with noodles and some spring rolls. I really enjoyed it and they made it extra spicy for me.  Definitely will be back for another go.  Only 4 stars because portions were slightly small."}
{"text":"Ive had Satay Beef Pho at no less than 40 restaurants in town and enjoy the difference in all the recipes. However, some stand above the rest with perfectly proportioned spices, delicious broth, fresh beef and a healthy amount of spicy-ness. 
I walked into Saigon Thai and was greeted by a very well kept and clean dining room. The waitress was MUCH quicker to serve me than most Vietnamese restaurants and was very friendly. The Satay Beef Pho (#10) was an average sized bowl with a matching price point. The flavour...far from average! Delicious! Spicier than most ive had but thats what I love! The beef tasted fresh, the broth was not overly salty and did I mention it was nice and spicy! The waitress checked on me not once, but twice and was very pleasant. Overall i dont even have one \"but\". Overall it was one of the best Vietnamese/Thai restaurants ive been too, I highly recommend it and I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointing. Miss L's *Thai Spinach Salad* was drenched in dressing which was overwhelmed with fish sauce; had way too much onion (loaded with white onion, of all things; and caramelized onions); overcooked eggs (a bit green); and spinach stems were not removed. The picture shown in the menu did not match at all what was delivered, although this wasn't a real problem. 

My *Tom Yum Soup* (ordered medium spicy) had almost no flavor of spices; and had substantial pineapple which overwhelmed the soup and made it much too sweet. The shrimp was fine, but the chicken (billed as grilled), had been boiled instead and placed in the broth. As a result, the texture was not very nice. The noodles had to be eaten with a fork, spaghetti-style out of a soup bowl, because chopsticks were not offered. 

This is a nice looking restaurant, and the service was good and polite, and it was very clean. I usually visit a restaurant 3 times before I post a review, but I just can't do that with this one. It's not that it was bad, it just wasn't good or professional; although the price-point would indicate better quality. I suspect there is not a real Chef in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Tried the regular pho. To be honest it was okay. A bit salty and the portion was mediocre. They used a skinny type of noodle which was different than other pho places."}
{"text":"We have dined in as well as ordered for delivery on line. We have not been disappointed. I agree with another reviewer, really enjoy the coconut milk soup. The Pho is excellent as well, tasty broth and nice to have 3 sizes available for most. A great spot and very pleased to have discovered this gem. Great service, reasonable prices, very tasty dishes. Well done."}
{"text":"Place was great, service was excellent.  Try the Coconut Milk Soup, came here twice in 2 days for it."}
{"text":"Only tried the pho, which I thought was average. It didn't automatically come with the usual basil, bean sprouts, chilli peppers, and lime, which I thought was weird. The waitress did ask if I wanted basil and sprouts when I ordered though. Portion was good, there were lots of noodles and meat in the bowl. Some other weird things I noticed is the hoisin sauce and hot sauce came in a dipping dish, which is fine, but I would rather mix my own (I like more Sriracha) and I had to ask for chopsticks. Don't think this place is really catered to the Asian crowd."}
{"text":"Admittedly I am all about the service. I appreciate food, believe you and me and I return for scrumptious food but I won't return to poor service. That's why I am a regular here. The staff here smile. They are genuinely wanting you to enjoy your meal. They don't interrupt and balance our need for service with respect for our time to eat and socialize. The food is amazing. They know I am wheat free and are considerate of that when making recommendations - which I ask for because I have sampled much of the menu. The red curry - delicious and with enough heat to stimulate your tastebuds but not enough to ruin the flavour of your tea. The papaya salad - divine. The portions are formidable and they heat up well the next day. I also have enjoyed the basil chicken and many others and have yet to be disappointed. If you order something that is best served with rice you have a couple options and I personally like the coconut rice. The restaurant is not very big and it is not often too busy. I highly recommend visiting this little treasure and giving them a really great chance of success! I will add a picture next time."}
