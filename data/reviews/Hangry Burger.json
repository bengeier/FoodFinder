{"text":"reading other reviews has me scratching my head.... \"flavourless burger only a small taste of charcoal\" ?  They pan fry their burgers.... as for burgers being dry?  i found their burger to be too oily.... i will say that the burger was tasty and the onion rings were great.  Staff was very friendly.  Price seemed a bit high but being on Yonge Street in the downtown core has to have pricey rent so the $ 13 i paid for a combo wasn't totally uncalled for.   i think it's 100% better than Jackson Burger and no i'm not a friend nor do i work at Hangry.  Like i said, i found the burger patty too oily and i padded the patty with napkins to get off the excess grease and oil.  i would go back but i would also give other places a try too."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy but they tasted great with the sauce they came with, but the burger was just awful. It was completely burned, and totally flavourless except for a strong hint of charcoal. After trying to trick myself into eating it, putting lots of ketchup and mayo on it, I just gave up. It may truly be the worst burger I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The Burger was good.
Fries were not crispy and very small portion.
Beef Poutine had more of the same fries with a hamburger patty overcooked and chopped with powdery tasting gravy.
Onion rings were soggy from being in their air tight package but might have been good if eaten at the restaurant.
Too expensive compared to others."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon.  Ordered a double trouble, a cheeseburger and a poutine to go.  There are definitely better burgers out there.  Our patties were pretty much burnt and therefore it was difficult to eat and the cheeseburger was stacked so badly that it was a mess.  The poutine was okay but nothing special.  Overall, if you are hungry and you pass by this place just keep walking."}
{"text":"Ordered from here via Just Eat, delivery was very fast and the food was hot and fresh, finally nothing soggy which is a nice change as any time i order onion rings or fries, they are inevitably soggy by the time they arrive.  I got the single Hangry Burger, it had really excellent thick double smoked bacon on it, which again is a nice change because these places always brag about the bacon, and they never deliver, it;s either so thin you can see through it or it's undercooked. This burger was excellent, fresh toppings, well assembled, it was easy to eat, and was not falling apart as i ate it. The burger was the perfect thickness, and cooked to perfection. They have beer battered onion rings and fresh cut fries, both were really good. Again i was relived that they were crispy and to add to that, they were both delicious as well. overall, it was a very good burger and experience, i would definitely pop in or order again without hesitation as this place seems to really care about the food it puts out there. And it definitely shows!"}
{"text":"Got the Hangry Burger Combo. Burger was excellent and the lady who served me was extremely professional and friendly. I went there as they opened, so the fries were also made very fresh and hot. However, I still feel burgers downtown in general are getting pretty expensive (around 10 bucks for a burger, tho it's becoming the norm).

Quality: 8.5/10. Service: 9/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Jamaican burger via the PayPal app. I am so thankful for restaurants that take PayPal and know how it works. Within 10 minutes they had completed my order and the price is right. 

The burger itself is the right amount of messy, and one of the better burgers in the city of Burgers (Toronto). I'd order here again, the service is fantastic here too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant and super delicious burger! I had Trouble burger with a veggie patty! The fries were also good. Only thing i didnt like was having to use ketchup packets instead of a dispenser or cup of dipping sauce. Whatever though, the burger was awesome!"}
{"text":"The only reason this get's a two starts is because the food is palatable, and it tastes good when you're at the place.

Regardless of whether the order is made for delivery, or in person at the restaurant, the line cooks should be able to read and decipher their orders and make sure to ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE REQUEST BECAUSE IT'S WHAT SOMEONE PAID FOR.

I know a side of sauce doesn't cost much, so money aside, adding sauce to a burger when it was ordered as a side, makes it a soggy disgusting mess that is very difficult to eat if it's a delivery and the burger has been sitting in a car for over half an hour.

PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING DELIVERY FROM THEM, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET YOUR ORER RIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"Hangry  burger is fairly new  just opening  in May of this  year.

I tried both the ground  beef poutine and hangry  burger. 

Let's  start with the burger. It wasn't as juicy as I like it too be. Maybe just  need to be cooked less but the favour was there. Patty was thin so i cant have been more then 6 ounces  but more likely 4. There hangry  sauce was good. So that a plus for a good personal  sauce.

The poutine was actually  the star of meal for  me. The ground  beef was tasty and there was more  then enough gravy and cheese curd. And i believe i was told the curds were imported from Montreal and maybe  the fries but either way  it was good.

My grip  with most  poutine is when you get to bottom. There is no gravy left and some of fries may not  be as fresh. But that  wasn't an issue here.

My only issue was price  8.99 for  whst i. Assume was 4 oz  I could be wrong. All.anf all.a good meal

Would be closer to 3.5 but i give them extra  star"}
{"text":"This is a pretty small location, and most orders were either for takeout or delivery. 

The service was good and efficient. I got the double trouble burger combo, which has 2 beef patties, and got fries on the side. This came up to about $16.50 before tax. Both the fries and burger tasted good, but the price is a bit too high for me personally for a fast-food-like joint."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple times and they definitely make a good burger. If you're looking for a good patty, come here!

A couple things to note:
-i wish they would grill the buns, i'll try asking next time
-fries were disappointing. I'd skip getting a combo, get another burger instead"}
{"text":"I was craving for poutine and found this joint. Bought there signature burger with ground beef poutine combo. The poutine was pretty good, instead of using gravy, I think they used the beef sauce. The burger looks small and tastes like a regular burger. Would come back for the poutine, not the burger."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for my order while I watched other people who had ordered before me receive their food first. My friends' burgers got cold while they were waiting for me.

The meal (burger + onion rings) came to $18 in the end. That in itself would be considered overpriced for a combo meal. DEFINITELY not worth for the poor service."}
{"text":"I don't recommend coming to this place if you're hangry. At least for the time being considering how new this place is. It took us 5 minutes to order two meals. Yup, not the best to be when you're hangry huh?

My boyfriend ordered Xtra Hangry while I got Trouble and one of us got the combo which came with fries and a fountain pop. 

My Trouble burger? Delicious, although I prefer to go lighter on the ancho chipotle sauce. However, I found the bun to be a little dry. I also took a nibble of my bf's burger and meh it's nothing special. The fries weren't bad, crispy and well balanced and fried but they need to use fresh oil. That's the only minor downfall. 

Overall? Yeah I might drop by again. 
There are 3 burgers on my \"To Try Next Time\" list so I will drop by again maybe in a month or so to see if they've improved on the service overall."}
{"text":"Was just looking a snack and came across this place. Decided to grab the ground beef poutine. It was pretty delicious. The beef was pretty well seasoned and tasted pretty fresh. The fries were cooked pretty well and the gravy and cheese curds were delicious. The cheese curds had that nice squeaky texture. Been wanting to go back to this place for their poutine again. I have been going to other places for poutine but keep craving to have this poutine again. Hopefully I will make my way back there soon."}
{"text":"I've been here four or five times. Sometimes, you crave a burger and fries for lunch. They make good em here.

They have a variety of meaty/spicy/tangy burgers to choose from, prices range from $6.99-$9.99. You can add free toppings and sauces to these.
The veggie burger ($5.99) is a good choice. I love their veggie patty, it wasn't dry - it was packed with flavour.
The beef poutine = Very filling. The to-go box was heavy... A bit too greasy for my liking, I wouldn't order this again. I'd try the regular poutine.

I appreciate the friendly staff and the cleanliness of this restaurant.

Overall, delicious food and great portions for the price you're paying. 
I ALWAYS leave feeling very full and satisfied. No qualms. An above average burger place. A great lunch spot."}
{"text":"New burger spot in the neighbourhood so I had to check it out.  They have some pre-constructed burgers you can pick from or build your own.

I built my own cheeseburger, and then made it a combo with onion rings and a fountain drink.  It came to just under $13.  If you order in, then you have a seat and they bring you a tray with your meal when it's ready. 

Portions were pretty good.  The onion rings were delicious!  I really liked them.  The burger as well was nice and juicy.  It's a thinner patty, which I like.  I'd say it was comparable to Five Guys, but better IMO because it's cheaper and there's more options.  You also have the option of putting in another patty if you want to make your burger thicker.  

Service was very friendly, and the place was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"A new burger place is always something worth investigating, so it was no surprise I found myself walking into Hangry Burger just a couple of weeks after it opened.

We showed up at around noon on a Saturday and the place was completely empty. I actually knew what I wanted to get before I even showed up, so I immediately placed my order for the Xtra Hangry (100% beef patty, sautéed onions, double smoked bacon, aged white cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and Hangry sauce).

Not surprisingly, the food arrived fairly quickly. I'll admit that the messiness of the burger was an immediate turn-off, but I'm not one to let appearances interfere in what could be a delicious meal. Sadly, the burger was nothing special. The toppings were fine, I guess, although the \"Hangry sauce\" was incredibly weak. I feel like if something is going to be called \"Hangry sauce,\" it should be loaded with flavor and spiciness. It should hit me in the face. This did not hit me in the face.

The patty itself was nothing special, either. It seemed to have been cooked on the griddle, but it was entirely lacking on the crust one expects from such a burger. And the fries were *way* too salty and unevenly cooked. (Some were basically burnt while others were underdone.)

I can't imagine I would ever eat at Hangry Burger again, especially when there are other, better choices nearby."}
{"text":"I just happened to come across this place today and loved the name so I decided to give it a shot ...and I'm so glad I did! I ordered the Hangry Hawaiian minus the bacon - it comes with a juicy beef patty, pineapple and a deliciously runny egg! This is my kinda burger! 
If you ask me, pineapple and eggs make every burger better! 

They recently moved from their other location so if you're in the area definitely check it out!!

Come hangry, leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Considering I get hangry constantly, paying a visit to Hangry Burger was a no-brainer. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience, from the way the restaurant is set up, the clever burger mascot, to the food itself. 

I ordered the \"Xtra Hangry\" with sweet potato fries and my friends ordered the \"Meltdown\" and \"Jamaican Me Hangry\". The burgers itself were juicy and the toppings complimented each other. Everything was delicious, fries were crisp and had just the right amount of flavour in each bite. 

Needless to say when hanger strikes again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"After the Pub night, my boyfriend and I were still hungry. We went to The Hangry Burger to have small snacks. The Hangry Burger is located Downtown Yonge St Toronto, which is 10 minutes away from our hotel. The restaurant is open late. We arrived the restaurant around 9 pm. The restaurant was not busy. There was only one customer in front of us. We've ordered the two Hangry Burgers, Poutine, and pop to eat. The food came out fast. The two hangry burgers tasted so-so. They were like a normal homemade burger, but no special tasty and seasonal. The Poutine was my favourite. It was hot and well cooked. The taste was great. The prices of food were a little bit of expensive. The food was OK."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Hangry last weekend partly because they had sweet potato fries on the menu but also because this place is super close to me. 

The location is great. Very accessible by TTC. The actual shop is quite big and there are plenty of places to sit. I don't think the place gets overly busy. I was there Saturday around 1 and it was pretty dead. 

I was served by a guy who hadn't been trained on the till as he said the owner had just ducked out and left him to it. So the ordering took a little longer than it should have but it's not like it was busy. I don't eat bacon but essentially ordered the Xtra Hangry sans bacon and with ancho chipotle sauce instead of hangry sauce and sweet potato fries. All up it was roughly $15 with a bottle of water which is pretty standard in downtown Toronto.

I had to wait a little while for the food but it was all being made fresh so it was a pretty normal wait time in my opinion.

The burger was... very average. It was cooked well- not too dry and slightly pink- but there just wasn't enough burger for the bun. I really wished I had ordered a double patty. The patty was quite small and very thin. The bun was disappointing too. Tasted a bit stale and I think toasting it might have improved it. The sweet potato fries were a real winner though. They were pretty much perfect. The ancho chipotle sauce was pretty good too (I got thrown a bonus dipping sauce on the side which was great with the fries). 

I was hangry again like an hour later... so I don't think this place quite lives up to it's name and with Holy Chuck just opening its new location a couple blocks away I don't think I'll be back. Overall it was ok. If I did come back it would be mostly for the fries and I'd make sure to order a double patty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and myself ordered hangry burger to- ago and it was so tasty!!

I ordered the vegetarian burger and it was so good. I just didn't like that they put so much saucesssss on it I had sauces falling from the burger and made it a bit messy to eat when I got back home. 

my boyfriend customized his burger he said it was absolutely amazing! He said the beef is cooked perfectly and it was nice and juicy and fresh. 

This burger joint is definitely one to hit up after the clubs or if you're just craving a burger one day."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch.  Haven't had any of their specialty burgers, just the Hangry burger combo a couple of times.  Burger is a good size and tastes great.  Side of onion rings is bigger than most places. Pepsi products on tap (but sadly no Mountain Dew!)

Prices are on par with other specialty burger places (which in my opinion means they're too high).  Combo was over $12 after tax (thus the star off).

Feeling Hangry?  This place will cure you."}
{"text":"Trouble combo $14.10 tax included. 

Beef patty, grilled jalapenos, chipotle sauce, lettuce, tomato. Fries and root beer. Flat top cooked burger. The fries were excellent."}
{"text":"Had the customize burger and a trouble burger combo through ritual. 
The good: sauces tasted really great & toppings were fresh. 
The bad: the burger patties were so dry & half the fries were overdone. The size of the burger is also tiny for what you're paying. 
Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Charged $3 for veggie burger substitute for its various signature burgers when a stand alone veggie burger is cheaper than the other meat burgers. Very shady business practice!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a hesitant 4. The burgers were fully satisfactory and my companion thought they were up there with the best burgers she's had. But, I've had Burger's Priest and Holy Chuck so the bar is set higher and the burgers here don't compare. They are better than the burgers at most restaurants, but they are pretty pricy. The milkshakes are good but the second time I got one there was ice in the milkshake (like the ice cream was icy) which kind of spoils it. I love me a good strawberry shake though! 
PS the bacon is really good so get a burger with bacon on it!
PPS this place is usually not busy when I've been, so I hope they make it..."}
{"text":"My fiance recommended this place to me and I stopped by lunch. Very clean and neat atmosphere. Their menu has signature burgers but also classics like cheeseburgers etc. The lady who took my order asked if I was new and then explained to me briefly my options on toppings and burgers. Great customer service. The food did take longer than your average fast food burger joint but only by a few minutes and it was worth it. My burger was the smoking bull which same with bbq sauce and smoked gouda and smoked bacon. Fries were fresh and not too salty. The gouda cheese was WOW, the bacon too. I'd just suggest just changing the bbq sauce they use. But everything else was fantastic. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ironic this place is called Hangry Burger, because I was very angry and hungry while waiting for my husband and I's one burger and onion rings order. On a Sunday evening, with a total of THREE customers waiting, we and the other 2 customers waited 35 minutes for our order. Not only did we NOT get an apology for the waiting, we got a cold burger bun on top. The onion rings were disgustingly oily. The burger did NOT taste good. DO NOT GO HERE if you enjoy food. I was considering speaking to the manager but the cashier girl had such an attitude when we first ordered, I decided to post my complaint here on Yelp. 

With this kind of business, I won't be surprised if they are out of business in a few months after their first lease payment is through. 

Burger = pathetic beef burger, cooked to complete dryness, toppings are amaturish (on the Hawaiian), cold bun, took 35 minutes to cook
Beer-battered onion rings = no beer taste whatsoever, oil dripping off, a total of 7 onion rings for a $4.49 side order

Total bill around $16 after tax. Disgraceful. Worst restaurant in Toronto. Again, DO NOT GO HERE if you enjoy food and you value your money. ZERO STARS."}
{"text":"Hangry Burger has moved into the location across from College Park where GBC used to be, next door to California Sandwiches Yonge Street location.

Having been open less than a week, they still need a bit of time to get up to speed but this neighbourhood can be unforgiving to new restaurants that aren't already a proven winner like Gu/Kinka, Bahn Mi Boys, Burrito Banditos etc.

The burger is cooked on a flat top grill like Burger's Priest, but lacks the flavour and seared crust you get at BP but it was a nice and juicy beef patty all the same.  Each patty is 4 ounces, smaller than usual in diameter (as was the bun) but thicker than most, which is good, I don't like paper thin burgers.

Hangry sauce is their version of special sauce, and a bit bland compared to BP's high priest sauce which I love.  But I need to stop comparing the 2.

I got the double trouble and hubby got the Extra Hangry with an extra patty, and while hubs didn't taste the bacon, by the time he noticed it was too late to check if it was missing.

We both enjoyed our burgers but were not blown away.  We both agreed we were glad we ate them there - burgers like this just don't travel well and fries and rings of any kind are terrible once you get them home.

Fries and onion rings were decent and hopefully will get better as the cooks get more experience and learn to make them crispier.

The 5 stairs to get to the order counter, 2nd eating area and washrooms makes for an unusual layout and make it non accessible for wheelchairs.   There is a ground floor eating area as you come in the door so lots of seating for the size.

The total came to $34 for 2 double burger combos, so the prices are as high as Burger's Priest... that might not appeal to the lunch crowd that work in the area who keep Wendy's and A&W busy, but BP always does well no matter where they are... didn't I say I was going to stop comparing them??!!  

Bottom line, liked Hangry Burger better than nearby Jackson's Burger but clearly I would rather have the High Priest from the place I shouldn't keep saying in a review for another burger joint.  

Will we be back?  Maybe we will give Hangry another shot in a few months to see if they have gotten over the growing pains."}
{"text":"Have ordered burgers here twice on the Ritual app, and I have discovered they are more generous with toppings on their special named burgers than when you request specific toppings.   Fries are surprisingly good.  Onion rings are good if you eat in, not so great when you do take out.

Single patty always feels a bit thin compared to all the toppings, so we always add an extra patty, which doesn't cost much.

Chocolate milkshake did not taste like chocolate, even with the extra scoop of ice cream.  

I will stick to the (double) burgers and fries with a pop instead of a shake, and won't be Hangry again!"}
{"text":"Hangry Burger offers an interesting lineup of signature burger creations and a spacious, well decorated diner near the Yonge & College intersection where the hangriest of us can enjoy a tasty meal. They're open until at least midnight (7 days a week) and are just steps away from subway and streetcar stops, making them a great option for a lunch, dinner, or late evening bite to eat.

Price might be a sticky point for some, but I'm a burger fanatic who is quite used to shelling out good money for the satisfaction that comes from a good patty or a hearty poutine. The atmosphere is nice in here, with plenty of seating and room to stretch yourself out. High ceilings and a thoughtfully decorated space make for an inviting experience. 

Aside from the quality of the milkshake and the cashier not knowing how much the burgers weigh in ounces when I inquired, I can't complain. They're a new business and there's lots of room for improvement, but I think Hangry Burger is off to a great start. I'm usually hungry for a burger and get off late from work, so I'm glad they've joined the slew of joints serving the downtown core."}
{"text":"Loved Hangry Burger. The service was friendly and super fast! The burgers and fries were perfectly done and delicious. It's rare to get such good service for a fast food restaurant these days, so my boyfriend and I were super impressed.

So impressed in fact, we're ordering them in tonight!"}
