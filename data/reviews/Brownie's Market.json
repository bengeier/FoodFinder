{"text":"Open 24hrs.  They have a variety of items but mostly sell lottery,  beers and wines.  They also  offer a small deli of premade subs, they aren't bad for the price you pay.  The new owners have cleaned the store, a lot!  It even smells clean!  Great service and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Though great for lottery or beer, this store is a bit terrifying for anything else. The store is always a slightly gundgy and over-stuffed with things. The deli counter seems questionable (and part of the deli cooler was filled with non-edibles last time I was inside). It seems like lottery is their blatant main focus, with winner flyers plastered on the windows and doors, and everything else is an after thought. The convenience of the location is nice for those staying in vacation homes on Lake Road, but don't expect the same variety of selections or the same style of fresh items as a Dairy Mart or Sheetz or Speedway."}
