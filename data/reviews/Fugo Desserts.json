{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to try this ice cream shop and was okay. My friends and I had the Thai tea and earl grey soft serve. the Thai tea soft servewas good...very subtle tea flavour and not too sweet. Personally wasn't  a big fan of the earl grey (found it tasted like perfume) but my friend enjoyed it. service was okay. Staff were nice and friendly but unprofessional. There were 4-5 of them hanging around the register eating timbits and ice cream. This behaviour is very unprofessional...seems like the shop was being run by a group high school kids. It totally turned me off."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, a bit small place but really nice. Their chalkboard wall is adorable and their menu's easy to read. Of course will be expensive but actually not that bad. Their cookie monster is good but the blue stains my lips, teeth, and tongue too much it was kind of embarrassing having to walk around downtown looking like that."}
{"text":"Dessert was great, not that many workers, really quiet. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I had the cookie monster it was good but nothing too special, if there is no line I would go and try other ice creams."}
{"text":"The ice cream is good, but they could really use some more flavours. Especially more non-tea flavours. Don't get me wrong tea-flavoured ice cream is fun, but 4/6 of their flavours are tea. 

Also, it would be nice if some of their special combos mixed flavours - its two scoops of \"cookie monster\" or two scoops of \"skor brownie\", etc. Whats the point of 2 scoops of ice cream at a place that brags its fun flavours, if you're only getting to try one? 

They also didn't have any \"flavour of the month\" to show when I was there. They said the next one would be red velvet, but means nothing if isn't actually there the whole month. 

Anyways, not sure I'd go back since there isn't much more to try. The fancy/exotic ice cream place market is pretty crowded in Toronto, so they might want to expand their selection to make it more appealing.

Since it was good ice cream, I would go back if they introduced more options."}
{"text":"Cute ice cream cones! A wide variety with new ones coming out. I had the Cookie Monster and it was sooo much ice cream. Could barely finish it... definitely not for post dinner dessert unless you get the smaller versions. The full double scope will leave you with a tummy ache!  

The service was friendly and fast. Only down side is the limited seating (although we were able to get a seat). There's maybe ~3 tables with tall chairs and the few seats by the window. I can definitely see this place full on a busy day but thankfully we got there before everyone got off work. Great to bring kids to or hang out with friends. Saw a little kiddie who was so fascinated with my blue ice cream she asked for it too. Adorable."}
{"text":"I honestly do like their ice cream. Liked the Thai Tea soft serve so much that I went back two days later to get it again. The product is fine, the delivery not so much.

I fully understand having to wait if there are a lot of people and have no issues with it. Heck I've waited 1.5 hours for a cheesecake before. When I went back there was literally only two people in front of me. The girl at the cash was great, friendly and engaging but I have no idea why she couldn't help with making the ice cream if there were no other people in line and everyone is just waiting. The guy making the ice cream was super slow. Not slow as in paying attention to detail but slow as in I don't know if he woke up yet. It was painful to watch and wait. I got soft serve in a cup, it's suppose to be super quick and easy but I waited almost 10 minutes. I got a small before and a large this time - there was no difference."}
{"text":"I sampled their Earl Grey and Thai Tea soft serves and was blown away.  

The Earl Grey soft serve starts out with a soft ice-milk taste, then melts on your tongue into a very subtle (but distinct) earl grey flavour.  

The Thai Tea was like a very mild chocolate, but the more I tasted it the more the tea flavour started to come through.  It's fairly similar to milk tea but better, I think!  Now I've got to try Thai tea!  

Both ice creams were light on the tongue, not overly sweet.  The flavouring is perfect, it's just enough to make you really taste the tea but not overwhelm you and make you sick of it.

My friend ordered the Bangkok Brownie (Thai Tea soft serve layered with soft, gooshy brownie pieces and topped with two chocolate stick things).  The serving size was pretty big, which almost-but-not-quite made up for the $7+ price.  We thought it would benefit from some crunchy oreo bits, like in ice cream cakes."}
{"text":"Fugo seemed like one of those places to try with the ice cream craze in the summer of 2016. With its convenient location and interesting flavours, it was a no brainer. Unfortunately, it didn't meet the expectations I had.

When I went they didn't have many options available, so I opted to try something they did have.

I ordered the Bangkok Brownie (Thai iced tea soft serve with brownies), and was somewhat disappointed/not blown away. The flavour was alright, but not too strong. The brownies were a nice touch, but again, nothing special. Next time, I'd rather go for some Thai iced tea flavoured ice cream elsewhere.

It's a shame this was my experience as I have heard good things about Fugo.

Overall, I would say Fugo has some interesting concepts, but the execution isn't up to par with other ice cream parlours in Toronto."}
{"text":"I get that this place gets busy and when I walked in there was a large group that was still waiting for their orders but wow...three people that ordered AFTER ME GOT THEIR ORDERS BEFORE I DID????! And the girl that was at the front did everything to NOT look at me while I tried to ask where my order was. I was two feet away from the cashier and she didn't think it was odd that I was still waiting for a soft serve for over 30 minutes???? I've worked customer service and food industry jobs and this was ridiculous. This is the first time I've actually been annoyed enough to make a 1 star review."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super friendly staff! Delectable ice cream and waffle cones!

The reason I knocked a star off was because it was cash only today (Friday) and a lot of flavors were out shortly past 4 pm. Also improvements can be made on their waffle cones. Taste and texture are awesome, but mine didn't close off completely at the tip causing my soft serve to start dripping in a matter of minutes.  It didn't survive my 5 min walk back to my building and I had ice cream all over my shirt, pants and shoes, looking like a messy toddler.  

I had a large Thai tea soft serve.  So perfect for a hot summer day!  I'll be back to try their hard ice creams esp Hojicha and Jasmine milk tea, maybe in a cup if I'm taking out.  Or I'll ask if they sell bibs if I go for waffle cones again."}
{"text":"Loved the staff, really helpful and sweet. Had the hot chocolate and probably the best I've had. Tasted so good and the marshmallow just added a kick every  so often made the flavour change with every sip. Seriously worth the trip downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have been disappointed both times.

Thai tea soft serve - this was very watery. There was tea flavour but I expected it to be creamier to resemble Thai milk tea, and to just have an ice cream texture in general. Very disappointed.

Cookie monster - probably their most instagrammed ice cream. It looked delicious but again, pretty disappointing for what it is. The blue ice cream is just cookies and cream dyed blue. Taste-wise, it's nothing special but it'll cost you about $8.

Their cones with the marshmallow and Oreo bits in the room are great, I'll give them that. But I would go elsewhere for better ice cream."}
{"text":"I went to Fugo Desserts after a really tiring day at a summer camp I volunteer at, and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. The service was really good as they made very good recommendation based on the preferences and my friends and I had.

In addition, I ordered the Bangkok Brownie but I was a little skeptical about it since it I'm not a very big fan of tea flavoured ice creams (because I find them to be very strong) however, it was really delicious. 

I worked from about 5 AM to 5 PM that day and I still had to take the train back home so I was already in a sucky mood but the ice cream was sooo good that it actually made me forget about the approaching thunderstorm and the hour ride back. I knew I was eating a very sugary snack but it didn't feel like I was consuming a surplus of sugar which made self-conscious me very happy :). 

I really felt like the flavours balanced each other out as the tea flavour wasn't very strong and the brownie wasn't too mushy or crumbly. Nonetheless, the flavour of the tea complimented the brownie so it didn't make it too sweet and the brownie allowed flavour of the tea to become sweeter and stand out in a unique way. 

Overall, it was a good experience and I really enjoyed it, I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I got the cookie monster cone (blue ice cream with chips ahoy cookies), I found the ice cream to be tasteless and not what I expect for a cookies and cream flavour. I did not want to finish it because the ice cream was so bland. It's good to try once but I regretted spending $8 on an ice cream I don't want to eat because it tastes like nothing."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get your ice cream fix! I keep coming back because I like how they  have a variety of different options that could cater to those who want an extravagant dessert, to those who want a lighter option. 

Their flavours are posted on their chalk board wall, which is really cute and has become famous on Instagram as their backdrop!

The Cookie Monster is so cute! It's a great option for those who really want to indulge! You could really see the high level of attention to detail as they make the desserts, as they ensure that every aspect is perfect for your perfect Instagram picture! 

I also really like their tea flavoured ice cream including the Hojicha and jasmine tea. It's a refreshing change from all the matcha flavours every other ice cream shop is serving. Don't be afraid to ask the staff what each flavour is, as they are really friendly and will offer you a sample to ensure you pick your favourite flavour! The staff is also really helpful in explaining the menu, and they also help make recommendations. You could really tell customer service is a priority for them.

My personal favourites are the soft serve options. They are said to be on a rotational basis, and so far the earl grey and Thai tea do not disappoint! It's perfect if you're looking for a slightly lighter option. They strike the perfect balance between a creamy taste while still keeping it light and refreshing. I can't wait to try other flavours they bring out! 

Only downside is sometimes they will sell out on some of their products, especially the popular ones like the Cookie Monster. So if you want to make sure you get what you want, I suggest you go earlier!"}
{"text":"Hit the 2pm slump one day at work on a Friday and decided to hit up Fugo for a pick-me-up.  On my previous visits I tried their very IG-able ice cream creations (which I thought were good but not worth the price), so this time I opted to just get a small soft serve.  I order their small Thai iced tea soft serve and it was bomb!  Very strong flavours of Thai iced tea and the soft serve was nice and creamy - great little afternoon treat (Think it was ~$3.65 with tax included)!"}
{"text":"Another foodie adventure with my friend this week and it's also thanks to her foodie friend who was raving about their Portuguese Tarts.  These aren't just regular Portuguese tarts either.  This is a wonderful hybrid of a more cheesy custard that taste much like a cheesecake, yet still custardy and with a shortbread crust rather than the regular flaky crust.  This thing was absolutely delicious! Because they're smaller than a regular sized tart, you can inhale a dozen easily.  Though I was tempted to buy some for myself, this is one of those desserts that you need to have fresh.  I could however, be wrong.  For my blood sugar's sake, I didn't get more.  Plus, we were also having some ice cream which I'll get to in a sec.  Definitely a 5/5 for the tart.

Now, the ice cream.  They have a few choices but they were quite unique.  We opted for the Genmatcha Ice Cream which was nice and creamy with enough bitter punch to the taste buds.  I'm sure I'd order it again after trying the other flavours. 5/5."}
{"text":"Cute, quick, tasty and affordable donuts! I got 3 mini donuts: Nutella, cookies and cream and the Homer. They were all tasty. Can't wait to come back and try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"Lovely, Lovely, Lovely! I'm such a fan of their Cookie Monster waffle cone ice cream! Definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Deeeelish. Awesome assortment of ice cream. The staff was so nice and helpful when deciding what to get! They try to get to know you and find the perfect cone for you."}
{"text":"Ice cream, it's fan-fking-tastic that is all. Oh and my mouth turned BLUE, I have become THE Cookie Monster."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to get ice cream in Toronto. My friend and I went for the first time and we each got a scoop of ice cream and some donuts. 
  The service was great, there was someone in the back making the ice cream and a person at cash who also served. They offered to let us try some flavours because we didn't know anything, and they were very generous with it.
  The prices were affordable, I got 6 bite sized donuts for around $5 and a tea infused scoop of ice cream for around $3. Over all the price was reasonable and the food was fresh. I personally really liked the s'mores donuts and the Hong Kong tea ice cream. 
  The space was a little tight and they didn't have many seats, but we weren't looking to stay for long. The wait for the ice cream and donuts was around 5min but you also have to consider the time it takes to make everything.
  Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"I got 2 scoops of hard icecream, 1 HK milk tea flavour and 1 Thai iced tea. In terms of flavour, I liked it but for almost $7-8 they were pretty stingy with their scoops.  Keep in mind I got just ice cream itself, no waffle or cookies or toppings. Compared to most ice cream parlours where the ice cream scoops are usually quite generous, I got two small balls of ice cream which just sat on top of the cone.

I like plain cones and theirs tastes stale. Their soft serve machine was down when I was there and majority of their flavours were unavailable as well. I had very limited options. 

Overall, the stingy portion, broken machines and stale cones are a big disappointment. Please don't be cheap and serve decent and consistent  portions. Also throw out old ice cream cones when it's stale and use GLOVES. 

 +1 star for customer service because the guy who served me was nice and +1 for HK milk tea flavour."}
{"text":"The tea flavours did not disappoint! They were very strongly flavoured because they used real brewed tea. I got the Jasmine milk tea scoop, and my friend got the Hojicha. We also sampled the Thai iced tea soft serve.

Jasmine milk tea: the flavour was strong and milky, but the ice cream was a bit strange. It was harder on consistent, but had a semi-chewy/chunky texture that confused me. I looked into the issue and found these soft white blobs that looked like frozen lard. Wasn't sure if that's supposed to be normal, but I wasn't feeling social enough to inquire. 

Hojicha: tasted like strongly roasted milk tea from Chatime. 

Thai iced tea: I should've gotten this one. It was a soft serve so it takes less effort to scoop, and the flavour was strong. Thai iced tea is usually my go-to, but I decided to change it up today. 

Seating: not many. There were maybe 3 small round tables and 5 single seats facing the window."}
{"text":"I went to Fugo on a cold windy winter day so other than me and my fiancé there were no other customers there. The staff are really talkative and nice. I wanted to try their soft serve but they said they won't run the machine in winter; they usually serve it starting April. But they had the same flavours as regular scooped ice cream. We got the earl grey and thai iced tea. I LOVED the thai tea flavour. It was so refreshing and not too sweet yet creamy and rich. The earl grey was also really great, less sweet than the thai tea one, but not as much creamy.
Will definitely be back in summer to get the same flavours as soft serve!"}
{"text":"Fugo was quite the experience! It was really hard for me to choose a flavour! I ended up choosing the infamous Cookie Monster which is the Oreo dipped waffle cone with two scoops of blue dyed cookies n cream with chips ahoy cookies. The whole dessert cost $8. Pretty pricey for what you get... but it's for the experience! They do offer other specialty cones with your ice cream!! You can also just get a scoop, 2 or 3 scoops in a cup or cone. Some of the flavours that they had were hong kong milk tea, green tea and more. They also sell hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the usual pleasure I get from anything sweet. Got myself the delightfully looking Bangkok Brownie & honestly you're better off with a $3.65 chocolate fudge brownie McFlurry. Everything else in their menu looks fancy. Not going back."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (50% of final grade)
I ordered the cookie monster, but they were out of the cookie waffle cone, so they subbed in the marshmallow one for me. The ice-cream wasn't anything special (though it did stain my lips blue for the rest of the evening, which wasn't exactly pleasant), but the waffle cone was nice. The crunchiness of the waffle cone paired with the chewiness of the marshmallow worked surprisingly well together! It was more of the texture I noted on though, because the actual sweetness of the cone was overpowered by the temperature and sweetness of the ice-cream. In general, nothing worth going downtown specifically for, but if you do pass by it, then you should at least buy the cone by itself to munch on as an afternoon snack.

Ambience 2/5 (15% of final grade)
Simplistic at best, there were only a few chairs and tables for seating. This place was obviously meant for the adventurous, rich, young people who don't really care to sit down and enjoy food, and simply want to grab something nouvelle and slightly deviating from mainstream. The chalkboard was illustrated nicely, but otherwise the place was simplistic to the point of being slightly shabby, and the floors had ice-cream stains. I went on a weekday afternoon, so it wasn't busy even... I would wonder how clean they keep the place when it gets really busy. The actual storefront is also incredibly easy to miss--I walked past it at least three times before seeing it (but that might be because I also walk really fast).

Service 3/5 (15% of final grade)
The staff were friendly and refreshing, but not incredibly notable for their service in particular.

Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade)
$8 for average-icecream-saved-only-by-the-texture-of-its-wafflecone is not exactly totally reasonable. I understand that it's downtown core, and the serving was the size of a small meal, but the price was slightly below par for the quality of food I received. 

Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade)
The experience was nice in general, but nothing notable enough for many brownie points... I mean, it's ice-cream. What can I say? Thought was put into naming their products, and the presentation, but food can't simply be for instagram! I actually went with a colleague, and he couldn't find the place at all, so I ate the ice-cream without him (savage, I know). I told him it wasn't worth it, and he didn't bother trying it.  

Final Grade = 49/100 = 2 stars, but so close to 3.

TLDR: *Maybe* I'll go back for just the waffle cone? *Maybe*?"}
{"text":"When you want a donut but you don't want to cheat, their mini hand made donuts will hit the spot without the guilt.

The difficult decision is figuring out which of their many creations to have.

Reeses, s'mores, and Nutella pictured"}
{"text":"So that cookie monster cone went viral through social media, but it's just a regular cookies n'  cream ice cream with LOADS of blue dye. The taste is no different from your usual cookies n' cream. It'll leave your teeth, tongue and lips completely blue.

They seem to be permanently out of the jasmine soft serve, it always has the X on it.

the hojicha ice cream and the earl gray soft serve are pretty good, however the Thai tea soft serve is WAY too sweet."}
{"text":"Yay an ice cream shop near University and Dundas!

It is neat because they serve scoop ice cream and soft serve, and let you how the option of bowls, cones and well as their special combos. I had to get the Cookie Monster because I love cookies and this cone (around $8, I know, what a splurge) was essentially cookie ice cream covered with cookies in a cookie cone. I think my cookie cravings have been satisfied and more after this visit. I like how the ice cream wasn't too sweet, it was colourful and fun, and didn't melt quickly. My friends got the twist cone of Thai milk tea and Jasmine and liked that we well! Would recommend you to come here if you want some dessert.

The ice cream here not only looks tasty but IS tasty. 

It is quite a plain space and there is seating for less than 10 people inside. The menu is neat as it is drawn by chalk on the blackboard wall.

And yes, my lips were stained blue for the day."}
{"text":"I got the cookies and dreams ! The ice cream looks better than it tastes :( ! It's great for instagram but not to satisfy your icecream cravings."}
{"text":"This place has been blowing up on social media and it definitely is because of its aesthetics, not really the quality. It is regular ice cream, but just more expensive. They have pretty unique flavours, like kekou gelato, but i dont think its really worth the price. I got a milk tea flavour and the flavour didnt really stand out. It's a good location because its right by yonge and dundas. Its a small place with very limited seating."}
{"text":"I ordered the s'mores on s'mores ....This was everything I thought it would be. Torched marshmallow yummmmm! It was perfectly sweet. Love the cone- chewy on top."}
{"text":"Honestly is just regular ice cream, no better than many of the other regular ice cream joints in TO. The icecream is perfect... for Instagram but is not \"amazing\". If there's no line definitely try it but I wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes just for this ice cream. With that being said... It is really pretty for the camera (I'm not a photographer don't use my uploaded picture as reference). 

The staff are very kind and helped me decide what I wanted since there's so many choices. The staff member there also made me very sad and almost cry when she said that they didn't have sesame ice cream that day but I digress...

Last: If you have kids or little siblings this will definitely be something they enjoy and will make their day."}
{"text":"Over $7 for a signature cone after tax seemed pretty steep, but I was willing to try it after seeing my friend's pictures of her dessert here. 

In the end, though, I feel like that's what Fugo does best - serve you stuff that's really Instagrammable but tastes, well, just okay. 

I wish the ice cream had been creamier. I wish the cone had been fresher. I wish it hadn't started running down my hands as soon as I walked out the door. 

It's a great stop if you want to impress a date with a pretty dessert or post some food porn on Insta/Snapchat, though."}
{"text":"Bangkok Brownie: Thai iced tea soft serve with brownie chunks. the soft serve melts so fast but still flavorful, and I liked it because it is not so sweet. It is not very creamy because it is soft serve. The brownie is just normal. I guess it is the combination that makes it popular.
Smores on smores: liked this one more than bangkok brownie because I basically love anything with burnt marshmallow! the ice cream itself is not overly sweet, and it is just delicious to taste the warm marshmallow and the ice cream at the same time. loved the cone covered with cookie chunks too"}
{"text":"Ice cream and desserts were the go to this super warm and humid summer. Fugo was definitely on the radar for many! 

I dropped by after work one day with a friend and we opted for some of the more regular desserts as we didn't want anything overly filling. 

I ordered the earl gray soft serve which was very light and refreshing. It wasn't as smooth as other places but had more of an iced texture. 

My friend ordered the jasmine green tea soft serve which was super flavourful! 

Overall a decent shop to satisfy the sweet tooth in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Overrated!!

This place was calling my name after seeing it all over Facebook and Instagram. Anything to do with cookies and ice cream has got me head over heels.

Naturally I would order the Cookie Monster cone, which is a cone lined with a Oreo marshmallow mixture, topped with two scoops of blue cookies and cream ice cream, and sprinkled with mini chocolate chip cookies.

We waited around 15 minutes for this, which is not bad at all considering the lineups at other places *cough* sweet jesus, *cough* bang bang.

But it was mediocre. I don't know if I came in with too high of expectations or what but I didn't enjoy it that much. 

What did stand out to me was their Thai tea soft serve! Mmmmmmm! That stuff is really good, very flavourful and creamy. This is the only reason I would go back."}
{"text":"Though one look at Fugo's ice cream does, I admit,  make me excited, I would have to say that it doesn't quite satisfy the high expectations I had for this trending place. The ice cream is decent, don't get me wrong, and the people working there are quite friendly, but is rather expensive for what I would call your average-tasting ice cream shop. I've had the Thai tea, HK milk tea (both in the bangkok brownie dessert) and Early Grey (in a fugo cone) flavours--all which were just the right amount of not-so-sweet..but the flavour was very timid and ice cream a little icy. Would've liked a creamier version. They also seem to run out of things quite often, near the end of the night. My single scoop with their fugo cone (because they ran out of waffle cones) came to be $6.20--which I must say, was not worth it. The bangkok brownie--2 scoops with brownie chunks--at $7.90 was not anything amazing either. At nearly $8 for their specialty desserts and $6 for a single scoop...I'd expect something a little more amazing!!"}
{"text":"I simply LOVE THE CRISPY COMB. i'm SO utterly delighted that they brought it back and this time with their Soft serve that they brought back too! This is a must try if you haven't been forunate enough to try it the first time.

I highly recommend the Milk Tea flavour and Earl Grey, they are two of my favourite flavours along with ANY of their waffle cones; my favourite is the smores one with marshmellows to add that chewy texture to your cold and creamy icecream and crunchy cone.

Overall this place is great for grab and go icecream with limited seats when it comes to busy peak hours so choose wisely when to visit!"}
{"text":"This place has bren bookmarked for months now, since they've opened, and I finally got to try this place out couples of weeks ago. Located on a busy street, its simple sign stands out. The interior isn't all too spacious with a limited seating area however there is a space with a chalkboard that can definitely keep you doodling while you wait for your order. Specialized in soft serve ice-cream, this parlor definitely stepped up their game to their competitors with their creative and eye-catching display of their ice cream. Of course, if you are Torontonian and have many foodies as friends, you might have seen quite a number of times, their famous cookie monster ice-cream! The ice cream here not only looks great but also tastes great! I personally enjoy their Thai tea soft serve :) Overall, the service is friendly, quick and efficient and flavours are great too! I will definitely come back and bring along many other of my friends! :)"}
{"text":"We were looking for some dessert on a weekday evening and fugo popped up on the yelp list for dessert places near by. Excited, we ventured out! Fugo is a simple ice cream and soft serve shop. The downtown location is certainly very convenient and there was a small line up. The shop is a bit small; there's probably about three high tables with two to three chairs per table. There's no bathroom. So it isn't really a place to sit down and catch up with old friends.

You can choose from their specialty ice cream (for example cookie monster, which is the blue ice cream with cookies that you often see in their pictures). I got this one! You can also get just scoops of ice cream if you like, so you can create your own combination.

Although it looks amazing (A+ for presentation), it was a solid C for flavour. The cookie monster icecream is a like a very bland cookies and cream, with old cookies. The small chips ahoy cookies on top of the ice cream were hard, very crunchy/crumbley, and dry. I would have recommended using soft baked cookies. And lastly, the oreo cone was nothing special. My friend order a scoop of hong kong milk tea and one scoop of hojicha. Now, if you've ever been to Kekou's.. their tea flavours are potent and you can really taste the difference between each of their flavours. There was no difference between these two tea flavour at Fugo and moreover, it was slightly bland too. Would I come back? Probably not"}
{"text":"My favourite ice cream place in Toronto! I always get the cookie monster and never regret it, even with my blue lips! 

My first time there, the staff was very helpful and even showed me pictures of the different types of ice cream to help me decide which one to get! The shop is quite small and they definitely need to invest in more tables and chairs if possible! Lots of customers are left standing and eating their ice cream.

The price is quite expensive and comparable to Sweet Jesus, however the ice cream here is much better! Definitely will return in the future and would recommend to anybody wanting some ice cream!"}
{"text":"Let me just say this dessert shop is absolutely amazing. I had the cookies and cream, s'mores and lemon meringue doughnuts....BOMB!!! I also had the s'mores s'mores ice cream cone... BOMB!! I have to come back before we leave Toronto."}
{"text":"After having tried Sweet Jesus and being disappointed at the hype, I was hesitant to try this place. But the sweltering hear of the summer finally broke me and boy was I glad fugo was right around the block! The ice cream creations here are simple yet creative and very intricately made. You can tell they put a lot of effort into their work. The flavours are quite unique, with both soft serve and ice cream options. Thumbs up fugo for making the heat a lot more tolerable! :)"}
{"text":"The s'mores on s'mores is amazing. They add a layer of marshmallow over the ice cream and they use a waffle cone coated in crushed skors candy. It was so good. We also got the Cookie Monster cone which is a blue cookies and cream ice cream with chips ahoy mini cookies over it. It's such a cute looking cone. The staff are really friendly and they let you sample their other flavours of ice cream too. They have Asian inspired flavoured ice cream like Hong Kong style milk tea ice cream and it tasted pretty close to the actual drink. Overall I would definitely come back for the s'mores on s'mores. The only down side is the Cookie Monster ice cream stains your lips blue but it's still worth a try."}
{"text":"i tried the earl grey soft serve ice cream. personally i thought it was a tad expensive but still tasted very good. i want to go back another time to try their specialty ice cream flavours (when i have more money in my pocket)"}
{"text":"Famous for the perfect Instagram shot complete with dipped cones, cookies, and chocolate! I came here after having a big brunch already so I opted just to try the blue cookie monster ice cream.  A fun and totally picture perfect ice cream, I would definitely come back for round 2 (but next time I'll make sure I get the full package!)"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I ordered the Bangkok Brownie. Ice cream itself was tasty and would have been special if the chocolate drizzle and brownie bites didnt cover up all of its flavor. 
My friend ordered the cookies n cream but they forgot to put all the decorating cookies and Hershey's on the ice cream.  Everything was also way too sweet."}
{"text":"It's once again those typical cute dessert/ice cream shops where you would visit for its hype. 

I ordered the Cookie Monster as it seemed to be the main attraction and my friend ordered earl grey and jasmine milk tea! 

The price was fairly reasonable as the scoops were pretty big. The ice cream in general was good but not overwhelming. However the idea of Cookie Monster was pretty smart and cute. Perfect for all you instagramers out there!"}
{"text":"I got the cookies n dream and smores on smores ice cream here. The total was around $15. I was excited to try it because of the photos I've seen on social media and the ones posted around the store. The smores on smores was really sweet for my personal preference where the torched marshmallows was thick, wrapping around the top scoop. The ice cream itself however was the right amount of sweetness and texture. I found that the price was not worth the ice cream but I would try the other tea ice creams which my friend said were their better options. Staff were kind and fast as well."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try out this place with ice cream being my absolute favourite kind of dessert but was a little underwhelmed when I actually tasted my order. I got the cookie monster and my friend got the s'mores on s'mores. Though they both looked decadent and very cute in presentation, they tasted average and even a little odd with so many components that were just not thoroughly mixed in/paired well together. Womp. The price they charge for one of these special cones is also a bit pricier than what it deserves. 

My mind might be changed if I come back and try the other flavours such as Thai Iced Tea etc. etc. but with the abundance of ice cream places around Toronto Fugo just simply does not stack up."}
{"text":"Yummy! Homemade, fresh, on the spot donuts! The  roasted marshmallow topping brought this Hot Chocolate to an all time high. Fast service. Clean establishment. Very friendly service. Definitely returning to Fugo Desserts."}
{"text":"No.
Go to Laura Secord. Go o Purdy's. Cheaper and smaller line.
Just not worth it at all... it was so PLAIN. I paid $7 for a cone that tasted like it was from walmart, and ice cream scoops that were small and barely creamy.
I would definitely just pass...
So overrated."}
{"text":"I love Fugo! Since trying it in the summertime, I have been back many times since. I enjoy the light flavours (you don't feel like you're eating super heavy, creamy or super sugary ice cream, which for me is refreshing and comforting - makes me feel less guilty indulging haha). My favourite combination by far has to be the earl grey and HK style milk tea ice cream flavour twist. Although it is the cookie monster that gets the most Instagram posts, I am a simple gal - I like the soft serve twists in a cup. Price is quite reasonable being in the downtown core however my only complaint really is the slowness of the service at times. How long does it take to scoop ice cream or retrieve it from the machine? Shouldn't take that long."}
{"text":"Solid ice cream place for me!

I was able to try some flavours before making up my mind (I'm a very indecisive person). The hojicha tasted like roasted milk tea, similar to the Chatime drink (yummy!) The genmaicha tasted true to what it is, brown rice green tea. Both enjoyable flavours if you're a tea person or looking for something less sweet. 

I ended up ordering the thai tea and the early grey (lol). I found the earl grey to be very strong. It was very floral and was difficult for me to finish. I tried the thai tea soft serve before and I did not like it but the hard ice cream was a lot better. It was creamy and not overly sweet! Definitely a flavour I would be getting again in the hard ice cream form. 

Cookie monster was ok, flavour was average (cookies and cream flavour). The blue colour makes it pretty to eat but the colour bleeds a lot on your lips, tongue and teeth. 
Cookies n' Dreams had good flavour with the caramel and brownie bits. Overall smooth texture. 

Friendly service, they put up with my indecisiveness in front of cash lol. The store has 2 tiny tables, not much sitting area - more of a take-out store."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I was super excited to try Fugo when it first opened up. We first noticed them via instagram... after a couple of check-ins on facebook/instagram we decided to walk over before their grand opening because we saw some soft opening pictures. Walked over and was told they were not open yet.. quite disappointed but that didn't stop me from wanting to try it still!  We went two weeks later and was greeted by a very friendly staff. They have a chalk board wall of flavours/mix-ins to choose from.. it was hard for me to choose between the thai tea soft serve and going all out with a fugo creation. Luckily the server gave me a good sample size of all their soft serve flavours and that helped me decide on a fugo creation. I opted for the honey creation and my fiance got the cookie dough one. 

Instead of using their original vanilla soft serve for the honey cup, i asked to use the early grey soft serve and that definitely compliments the toppings. Was pleased with the actual honey comb in my creation as well. The cookie and cream creation was also tasty. Came with a crazy cone and lots of hershey cookie and creme chocolate pieces... but in the end, ice cream is ice cream... and paying almost 7 dollar for one cone is a little steep. Wish they had kid size cones or kid size cups!"}
{"text":"The line moved quickly and after placing my order at the counter, the two ice creams were ready really quickly too!  Considering that there was only one staff manning the cashier and two in the open kitchen behind him, it was a really fast order process!

Fugo's space isn't big and there are only a handful of tables with stools for you to dine in.  Most people order and then go with their ice cream or parfaits.  

As expected, the Cookie Monster Fugo Creation was highly \"instagramable\" /photogenic.  Many people like myself took the photo of this dessert creation against their chalkboard wall.  There was chalk available too for you to leave your own comments or messages too.

There were two scoops of the Cookie Monster ice cream and mini Chips Ahoy Cookies all on an Oreo Fugo Cone.  This was a big portion and if it really weren't for the photo, I could have ordered the one-scoop version.  Upon trying it, I understood why this was so hyped.  The ice cream not only looked good (and cute), but it tasted really good too!  The cookies and cream ice cream was very good and although it was blue, it's not like there was any flavour to the \"blueness\".  The Chips Ahoy Cookies were a good and yummy addition.  The ice cream didn't melt too quickly (a bonus!) and when I finally got to the cone part of the ice cream, the Oreo Fugo Cone was really delicious too.  The Oreo pieces were stuck onto the cone with something that tasted like sweet marshmallows.  After eating this, I'm sure I had a bit of a sugar high. 

The Bangkok Brownie Parfait consisted of Thai tea soft serve, brownie bits, chocolate drizzle, and chocolate wafer stick.  When tasting it, it had a very strong and loud Thai tea flavour.  I was impressed with that! I tasted the brownie bits too and was so satisfied with it too.   

The only thing I would say is that their desserts aren't cheap.  One ice cream creation or parfait was $6.99 and that's before tax.  That could be a cheap meal somewhere."}
{"text":"If you are a tourist, are obsessed with food pictures for your Instagram, will pay the overpriced price, and don't care about whether it is actually good then this is the place for you! 

To many new specialty businesses are trying to attract customers with \"cool\" looking creations so that their business grows on social media. Quality, price and flavour of treats makes you regret giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"Hearing all the hype about the desserts here I had to make a trip to try it myself.
I ordered the HK milk tea flavoured ice cream and it was so delicious! I also ordered the mini donuts in which they have many flavours of, they are a must!! Definitely try the donuts when you come here, they're also made fresh
My friend ordered the Cookie Monster, which I had a sample of. I enjoyed that icecream too, it has a very cereal-y milk taste if that makes sense. I could do without the blue dessert staining my entire mouth though lol
The store itself is very small and clustered, it's more of a place to grab n go. There's still a bunch of more flavours I have yet to try & definitely will make another trip to try them out."}
{"text":"I've heard many positive raves about Fugo's ice cream desserts.  However, it fell flat for me and my friends when we visited after a small dinner at Manpuku.  Upon entering the establishment, the first traits I noticed were the small size of the shop as well as the unkempt tables and chairs.  This is essentially a spot for grab and go ice cream, but when the staff aren't cleaning the tables and chairs frequently enough, one still feels discomfort when they're lounging inside a pigsty while waiting for their cone to arrive.  

Although I originally came for the Cookie Monster cone, I opted for the Thai milk tea soft serve with a chocolate almond churro instead.  My friend, who ordered the Cookie Monster, said it was just cookies 'n cream ice cream with blue dye, so I suppose I didn't miss much.  Since the churros were a new feature for them, it took about 10 minutes for my dessert to arrive because they fry the churros on the spot.  I was fine with the wait, but what was a red flag was that the employee making my churro had to be corrected by another employee several times on the steps she was taking.  Also, the person handling my soft serve did not seem to be on the same temporal wave length as the person making the churro because the former had placed my soft serve into the cup well before the churro was finished to be served, meaning I had slightly melted ice cream handed to me when everything was finished.

Now, other than the service, the food was not as \"rave-worthy\" as I thought it would be.  The Thai milk tea soft serve and the Hojicha  ice cream tasted watered-down, and the churro was small in size compared to what I'm used to when buying churros at the same price (eg. think of Mr. Chu).  Price-wise, the desserts are 1-2 dollars more expensive than what you could get elsewhere.  Therefore, I do recommend you to go elsewhere.  Their glorified cone combinations, like the Cookie Monster, look great, but you could definitely make it yourself or find something as snazzy for a cheaper price elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for that ice cream cone that photographs well, this is the place for you (if you already couldn't tell with the bazillion Instagram photos going around)! I had the Cookie Monster, and also tried the Bangkok brownie and enjoyed both creations!

Looking forward to future creations from Fugo!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is good. That, I cannot deny. The tea flavours are pretty delicious and satisfying after dinner. 

The mini donuts however...They are made to order which is good because you get them fresh and theres a bunch of different flavours to choose from such as smores, cookies n creme and canadian maple bacon. They look very appetizing and aesthetically pleasing. But the taste doesn't live up to the presentation. I think the toppings and sauce kind of melt when you put it on freshly made fried batter (the donuts) and the type of batter is different than a traditional donut which is why the toppings and flavours taste kind of off. 

I was really excited to try their mini donuts but if I come back, I may just stick to their ice cream or the mini donuts with powdered toppings, can't beat the nostalgic carnival taste afterall."}
{"text":"I only tried their mini donuts, so the 5-star rating is for their donuts. Their mini donuts is 3 for $2.75 and you can choose a different flavour for each one. I had the lemon meringue, strawberry jelly, and cookies and cream. I was really impressed by the time and care that went into each donut. The donuts were light and fluffy, and packed with flavours. Perhaps, the best donuts I've had in the city so far. Well done Fugo!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dessert on a Thursday evening. It's definitely no sit down, but more like a grab and go kind of place. Ordered a scoop of their Hong Kong Milk Tea ice cream and was blown away by the flavour and the colour of it. It tastes just like the milk tea you'd be having at a Hong Kong cafe. I'm glad the ice cream tasted like milk tea and not just milk. I find other places that try to make this flavour focus more on the texture of the ice cream than the actual flavour, which is why I was impressed by the colour of it. Other places usually try to make the texture creamy which masks the true flavours. Will definitely be back to try some of their other flavours and their donuts which were introduced not too long ago after their recent renovation."}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday with a friend and really enjoyed what they had to offer. 

Staff are super friendly and they introduced me to their instagram page which gave me a better idea of what their cones are like. 

Service was decent, came out pretty fast considering there were a lot of people and many of the specialty cones have a lot of toppings with them. 

Atmosphere is nice, clean, a little small but big deal. 

Prices are ok, but I believe for the quality you get, it's worth it. 

I thought many of the cones were innovative which makes this place unique. I can't wait to try the cookie monster one. Looks so good. I had the good morning and my friend had the cookies n cream. Lots of flavour. 

Great start for having just recently opened!"}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy comb and was pleasantly surprised. It was really good considering how simple it was! I'd definitely recommend this for a really nice, sweet treat. The only downside is that it is a bit expensive for its simplicity."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cookie Monster ($6.99) and my mom got the Thai Tea soft serve ($3.49). 

The price was not too bad for the amount that we got. It looks just how it is in the Instagram and Facebook photos which was really nice!

If ordering the Cookie Monster, prepare to gain weight. The ice cream itself isn't that sweet, but the cookies on it and the cone make up for that and then some. However, my weight gain aside, all I can say is AESTHETIC!! 

The Thai Tea soft serve was actually really good. I have a habit of ordering food for my mom and I, but getting the better dish for her, sometimes without even planning to. This was one of those unplanned times. I was slightly envious because I really liked the flavour of the soft serve whereas my cone's flavour was pretty generic. 

If you go with the intention to dine in, keep in mind that the seating is pretty limited. The way the laid out the place wasn't the best but it works. Although, if you get lucky and it's practically empty, you get to be in Insta-heaven (the blackboard wall is the best background for your ice-cool pics)!

I'd go back in the future, but I'll definitely be getting what my mom had next time."}
{"text":"Some pretty cool dessert ideas and in a convenient location as well. Good place to drop by after the Eaton centre to satisfy a sweet tooth. I would recommend cookie monster and the Earl Grey ice cream both are bomb"}
{"text":"They had run out of many of their menu items (goes to show how hot they are right now) so get there early if you want the cookie monster or other specialties. The desserts also seemed a grossly overpriced (12 dollars for a dipped cone, two scoops, and some oreo pieces) but I'm sure the market will tell them if this is worth the price or not. Taste was standard, nothing to write home about, but the shop itself was very cute."}
{"text":"I can understand the appeal of Fugo. Extravagant ice cream with jaw-dropping presentation. The immaculate white wall as the background to a perfectly-timed picture that will most likely find itself on social media. It's all very over-the-top and loud. I mean, if that's your thing, then yeah Fugo is the place for you, because chances are no other place will make ice cream as wild and deliciously presentable as these guys. 

However, when it comes to ice cream, I'm all about the flavour, the texture, the smoothness. I eat frozen goods with my mouth, not with my eyes (can't say the same for other food items though...)

And so when I took a bite out of my cookie monster ice cream, I felt really underwhelmed. It tasted just like your average cookies and cream ice cream from your local grocery shop... except it was blue. 

Don't get me wrong, the presentation is impressive. And if you want impress your Instagram-famous friends, then definitely take them here. But at the end of the day, when it comes to ice cream, I believe that simple is better."}
{"text":"New ice cream spot with some fun gimmicks. I don't think they have the highest quality ice cream, but I also feel like you know that going in. 

The Cookie Monster ice cream is super cute and cool. Tasted pretty good. But sadly they ran out of their special 'fugo cones',  so we couldn't try them. 

The honeycomb concoction was pretty good too. I actually didn't mind the corn flakes, which surprised me. 

Wouldn't go back but worth trying it out"}
{"text":"After seeing all the Instagram posts I finally got to try this place out. If you're unsure about which cone/sundae to get, ask them for samples and they'll happily abide. They have soft serve and hard scooped ice cream, so be sure to try both kinds! 

Their soft serve was a little icy and not as creamy/smooth as I had hoped, but the flavours were great. Prices were a little high, sundaes go for $6.99, but that's pretty standard for desserts in Toronto. There was also quite a few menu items that weren't available when I went like milkshakes and egg waffles. 

I'll definitely be coming back to try out some of their other items."}
{"text":"Even though they are known for their Cookie Monster ice cream, I went for the HK milk tea in a cup. I also got a churro with my ice cream.

HK milk tea ice cream - the ice cream base was nice and solid. It was also smooth and had a good taste of milk tea. I am a bit picky with tea flavours and think it can be stronger. That being said, once I dipped my churro into the ice cream, cuz the churro was rather sweet and covered with cinnamon sugar, I couldn't really enjoy the ice cream anymore as the churro flavours overpowered the milk tea. 

Churro itself was ok. Not the best but also not the worst. 3/5

Perhaps I should've gotten their cone and their signature ice cream combos because those looked amazing and my friends enjoyed it. 

Girl at cash was not the friendliest in my opinion, and could've smiled more and spoke a bit more politely. The gentlemen were more welcoming. They also didn't have soft serve available :( 

Will come back to try other flavours, but I may possibly choose other ice cream joints downtown before coming back to fugo."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but as far as the taste factor goes, it's just not up there! I got the cookie monster and found the ice cream to be so cold that I could barely taste the flavour! The cones are something special though - really elaborate, but very sweet and chewy (probably cause there's so many toppings that need to stay in place). I asked for a sample of the Thai iced tea flavour and I felt the same way about it. Not to mention that I waited patiently in line to ask for the sample (after already purchasing two decked out cones) and the man at the cashier reluctantly did it and said that people behind me were waiting (a total of 2 people behind me, wow...so busy). -_- 

Not comparable to the other great parlours in Toronto. Trust me - I LOVE ice cream. But if you're looking for something picture worthy, you're in the right spot."}
{"text":"While Snapchatting in the downtown core, I found a Fugo Desserts filter? What is this? Where is this? I wander around and found this little shop on Dundas just east of University.

The shop is small but has a dedicated chalk board wall with an artistic display of their menu. The menu is also printed on paper that's on the cash counter, as well as on their TV screens. 

The cashier was friendly and offered me some samples because I wasn't totally sold on blue ice cream for the \"Cookie Monster\". Then was told it's just cookies and cream with blue food colouring. They also have a Thai ice tea soft serve which was really good, but on this day, I just wanted something plain. 

I have to give it to them for having some good specialty cones that are Instagram worthy. I definitely like this better than Sweet Jesus."}
{"text":"Terrible mini donuts. Look tastier than what they actually are.
They aren't filled. The just put the filling in the middle of the donut.
We tried the Nutella, the Oreo and pistachio. But sorry, not coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon about 4pm. The place itself was something I would've missed if I didn't keep checking my GPS so keep an eye open when you're coming there! 

We were surprised to see that there wasn't any lines so we were served right away. I got the Cookie Monster and my friend got the Cinnabon with a regular cone (booooring). 

Cinnabon - it had like pieces of cinnamon rolls in the ice cream itself, he said it tasted just like a Cinnabon does LOL

Cookie Monster - the look of the ice cream was very Instagram worthy! It had mini chocolate chip cookies around the blue ice cream which had oreo(?) pieces in it. The ice cream didn't really have much taste to it BUT THE CONE WAS SO GOOD. It was a waffle cone dipped in marshmallow and covered in oreo crumbs and it was so chewy, I loved it. 

It was worth it for the picture but would I get it again? Probably not. I would definitely return to try the other many flavours they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream flavors! Everyone comes here for the cookie monster cone, but their other ice cream flavors are just as delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute concept. A rather inexpensive way to try a variety of little mini donuts. Rather pretty. At the end of the day, I think the reason I'm not loving this place more is because I just don't like donuts. Yeah. I'm no fun."}
{"text":"Great, innovative ice cream flavours that I have not seen anywhere else in Toronto! The ice creams look good and, more importantly, TASTE good unlike Sweet Jesus."}
{"text":"Ice cream is good, and it is a delicious cold treat in the summer.
They've renovated and now servce donuts and cheesecakes on a stick, which looks absolutely delectable but I could never imagine eating one - more sugar intake in one treat than I eat in probably a month.  Maybe I'd share a bite with somebody else that gets one. Donuts are freshly made and dipped, so it can take some time before you get your order - I've witnessed many impatient looking people waiting in the waiting area (which is super small btw) for their food. 

I've only ever gotten the ice cream here, which I can say it's pretty good. I'm going to tell you that if you get ice cream, you gotta get their specialty cones. Cookie monster ice cream. So good, even though it just tastes like a sweeter cookies and cream, dyed in blue. The cookies & cream cone is delicious af. 
Fugo also makes a lot of different and unique flavours, like thai iced tea, hk tea, london fog etc. A lot of them are good, but not pungent. I'd definitely drop by if I was in the area but would not go out of my way to grab a cone.

Wait times are long too - once we waited for our cone for probably 20-30 minutes, we had to get work to delay our meeting because it took so long to grab our cones. If we hadn't paid already, we would've just left."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. Service was great and ice cream was even better.

The ice cream was softer than expected and it was delicious with the cute cookies on top.

The place itself is  pinch (literally one table) so expect to get the ice cream and hang elsewhere.

The doughnuts were good as well -the Nutella one is the best."}
{"text":"It is never too cold for ice cream and dessert so after lunch I came here to Fugo desserts. They have some unique flavours such as HK tea, Thai tea flavor etc... I ordered the Bangkok Brownie which has wafer sticks, bites of brownies and the Thai tea flavored ice cream in a cup for about $7.90. I thought the ice cream was good but it wasn't mind blowing or amazing. The brownie was alright. I would have preferred it be more moist and softer. Decent place for desserts and probably would be more busier in the Summer time. I wouldn't mind coming back and try their other flavours."}
{"text":"They have cool ice cream creation (Cookie Monster and smores on smores). Very good ice cream for desserts after eating lunch, price is okay as it could be better but sort of worth it."}
{"text":"This place has amazing tea ice cream flavours that isn't too sweet! It's worth a try, the prices are decent for an ice cream shop! The staff there are super friendly and has a snapchat geofilter too!"}
{"text":"One of the better new ice cream places in my opinion. The price is average, the ice cream is delicious, and the portion is reasonable. 

For $7 I got the Bangkok Brownie. The toppings were great and that Thai ice cream had a great flavor. It was nice and sweet but not overwhelming like I find some other ice creams. The portion size is perfect. Some other places have huge portions that you can barely eat half off without feeling gross. Fugo has it perfect though. 

Overall it's a 4/5. Great, unique taste, even compared to other dessert places."}
{"text":"Cookie Monster - Blue cookies and cream icecream tastes like Kawartha icecream according to the bf b/c of how creamy it is. What I really enjoyed was the waffle cone. Judging by the fact they were in a tupperware container, someone took the time to make these at home. The crunch was very delectable! Love the marshmallow & oreo coating it's dipped in. 

Bangkok Brownie - Definitely less overpowering in flavour and suits my level of sweetness. I absolutely loved the Thai icecream. It was frosty, almost like a slushie but still had such a delicious tea essence to it. Y'knowhatimean? I would've been happy without the decoration (what seems like a store-bought egg roll & brownie crumble) and should've downgraded to a simple softserve instead.

5 bites of each will satisfy your sweet tooth. They really packed in the sweetness. I should've brought more people with me to enjoy icecream with. /nofriends"}
{"text":"This place is good for the instagram, meh for the ice-cream. Im not saying that its bad or anything but when the ice cream costs $6, Im expecting a little bit more than just cookie dough ice cream with some pieces of chocolates on it and a torched marshmallow puff."}
{"text":"Tarts are hot and delicious! The cheese cake tarts are not only insta worthy but melt in your mouth. It's worth the calories!"}
{"text":"The place is completely overrated (maybe people goes for the hype and pictures with desserts) and it's ice-cream overpriced.
Far below the average. A real waste of time (due to the usual long line) and money. You spend a considerable time in the queue and there is not even a mere menu available to choose what to have in advance. When you finally get in touch with the menu it does not explain anything and you have to ask cashier \"what flavors do you have?\" and there we go... And the biggest negative surprise: an ice-ream do not be worthy the wait and the price: frozen and crumbling ice-cream (yes, can you imagine an ice-cream with ice on it?). No creaminess at all. Do you really expect to get it over and go away as soon as possible. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I ran a 10 kilometre race and wanted to treat myself to something sweet. It was incredibly humid and the race day just happened to coincide with the grand opening of Fugo Desserts downtown, so I thought I'd give it a try.

The store itself is clean, white, and decorated very minimally. I tried one of their specialty items and I thought it was absolutely incredible. The ice cream, alongside the brownie bits at the bottom and the wafer sticks, make for the perfect cheat day dish. I'll be coming back multiple times to sample more of their specialty ice creams later on in the summer.

Next time you're in the mood for something decadent near the Yonge-Dundas area, Give Fugo a try!"}
{"text":"Went in not knowing much of the place. Just from seeing their different flavored and beautifully decorated donuts from the window, I knew I had to try it out. 

It's pretty cool how you can see them being made in the process. I ordered 6 donuts for $5.50, which I think is reasonably priced. You will definitely be able to finish in one sitting, well I most certainly could. They are quite the treat.

Flavours I chose were: Cookies n' Cream, The Jelly, Mini Homer, Chocolate Pistachio, Cocounut Bounty, and Maple Walnut."}
{"text":"Super sweet spot - just east of University on Dundas.
Customers inside are mostly just milling around or taking selfies so there was actually no line to order - got the 'Cookie Monster' - but there are so many delicious looking treats on the menu.
Portion sizes are huge so you won't be disappointed - 1 \"dessert\" cone (3 generous scoops) was enough for 2 to share - $7.50.
I feel they might be slightly overwhelmed with their new-found instagram fame, but ice cream was delish (the cone was chocolate/marshmallow-y heaven) & service was surprisingly quick."}
{"text":"Was walking around after a date with my husband at the art gallery, when we walked past Fugo. I recalled a friend saying that she enjoyed it, so we thought we'd check it out. 
I wanted to try the sundae with honeycomb, but unfortunately, the soft serve machine was malfunctioning. 
Employees gave me a solid 5 recommendations of other creations to try, substituting hard scooped ice cream for soft serve. Great service! Helpful and friendly but never felt pressured. My husband got the S'mores on S'mores and I got the Bangkok Brownie sundae, but subbed the thai iced tea soft serve for the HK milk tea ice cream. Delicious! The ice cream was exactly like having a nice cup of tetley tea, refreshing and milky tasting without being overly sweet. My husband was impressed with his as well, even Instagramed it (which is rare because he never Instagrams anything) 
Will definitely come back and try more, I still want to try that other sundae"}
{"text":"Had the chance to try out Fugo desserts new fall menu item, lava cheesecake tarts with a crispy shortbread crust!     I know they've been product testing for sometime now and I now I get to taste their finished product.  

Verdict? 

They are perfect...like a perfect liquid form of cheesecake, super smooth with enough salt to balance out the sweetness.  I like the puffy cheese filling look because they want me to have as much of that delicious cheesecake filling as possible .

The crispy shortbread tart crust is thin but strong, strong enough that I can bite into the tart without it falling apart and hold together all the warm and gooey cheesecake filling while offering a crunchy texture to contract with the smooth cheese.   

They taste heavenly! 

They still have icecream for the winter season but all their flavours now is in scoops, no longer a softserve item.  They have plenty of tea flavours that are quite good...and when in doubt ask for sample."}
{"text":"I was really excited to checkout Fugo Desserts last week as I heard so many great things about them. Unfortunately I was slightly disappointed. Perhaps I had too much of an expectation and anticipation before I got there. 

We ordered the Cookie Monster and Thai tea soft serve. The Cookie Monster icecream itself tasted decent but  the chips a hoy cookies were extra to me. It was way too sweet altogether. I would be more impressed if they made their own cookies. Their thai tea softserve was quite enjoyable though."}
{"text":"From what me have seen from what folk say and share of Fugo, me got impression it is a sort of Sweet Jesus meets Kekou kind of ice cream shop.

In execution however, the ice cream concoctions are not as outrageous as foodies portray them as. They don't have many choices of flavours (just a handful in both hard and soft serve) as one might hope, and even fewer it seems by the evening when half of it all is sold out in my visit. Underwhelming much to begin with.

Me want try Bangkok Brownie creation, but since they ran out of the base ice cream 'Thai Tea', it couldn't be done. Me instead went for what everyone is getting and photographing: the blue dyed cookies 'n creme ice cream, a.k.a. Cookie Monster, with mini cookies added for good effect. It was meh, and it made me lips and tongue bluer than a losing Blue Jays game. Me did also dabble in their Hojicha soft serve, it had strong green tea aroma.

What sucked in me visit was only one man behind the counter doing everything. Seriously? Poor guy; me turn around and see looooong queue of hungry cookie monsters. You'd think on a summer day they would have more staff on hand to speed things up, never mind stop the shop from running out of half their flavours so quickly.

Come for the tea flavoured stuff and Instagram pics, that's about it. 

{TTC: St. Patrick station}"}
{"text":"This place was alright, but I've definitely been to better ice cream places for a cheaper price.

The store is quite small and only has 2 round tables and one long table at the back for you to sit. They have a cute chalkboard with some menu items, but no prices listed.

I got a two scoop ice cream - Skor Brownie and HK Milk Tea. The flavours were pretty good and the HK Milk Tea was quite unique. Both flavours were a little on the sweet side for my liking. The total came to about $6 which isn't too bad.

I might come back here again but nothing really stood out from my experience."}
{"text":"Light dessert perfect for people who don't usually eat sweet stuff - me!

Cheese tart: 4.5/5. Fine salty touch to light and non-yolky filling inside the crust. Good for people who are not big fan of dairy goods.

Nutella hot chocolate: 4.6/5. Tastes as good as it looks. Not too sweet which is great. I love how the edge or the cup is dipped in Nutella then pretzel crumbs."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai tea soft serve, received rude condescending service and cone with icy, bland, soft serve.

My friend got the cookie monster, said it was just okay.

We came here because of the rave reviews and because my friend kept telling us to come here to support his friend, but I really don't get the hype and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place out today. We only spent 10 minutes lining up. So me and my friend decided to get the Cookie Monster & crispy comb. Unfortunately the taste wasn't as good as the look. The blue ice cream taste plain (we thought it'd be blueberry or bubblegum flavour)  but no, they used a good amount of food colouring so you ended up with a blue lips afterwards. The crispy comb wasn't what I expected either. It's just a plain soft serve with corn flakes. Nothing special except for the honey comb. Overall, i think with that kind of price, the taste should be way better."}
{"text":"First impression of Fugo was that they offered some unique ice cream creations which are probably popular to many for foodie pics. 

I opted for the earl grey as I'm a huge tea flavor person. The earl grey flavor wasn't as strong as I wished.  I was expecting something similar to an earl grey ice cream from a French patisserie with intense tea flavor. Anyways, I enjoyed it and will probably try their HK milk tea flavor if I pass by the shop next time."}
{"text":"Came across this place while walking down Dundas this evening and decided to try out their ice cream.

They had 7 flavours listed on the wall, as well as a number of special combos. Most of the flavours were tea-based. We were super full after dinner, so we opted to share a double scoop of ice cream as opposed to ordering one of their special cones. Double scoop was $4.49+tax which I thought was very reasonable. 

Initially we had decided on genmaicha and HK milk tea ice creams. We paid and then were informed afterwards that there was no genmaicha ice cream left. So we asked for Skor and brownie ice cream instead, and then were told that they were sold out of that too! I was a tad annoyed - the cashier girl should have known what was available and what was not...the ice cream freezer was literally right behind her. It wasn't until our second strike-out that she bothered to ask the ice cream scooping guy which flavours they were out of. Anyway, the ice cream scooping guy recommended hojicha as a substitute for the genmaicha - similar roast tea flavour but less nutty, he said. To make up for the inconvenience, he gave us larger scoops of each ice cream in separate cups. The scoops were VERY generous.

The flavours were great. Ice cream was smooth and creamy, and the flavours were strong without being overly sweet. The HK milk tea was reminiscent of original black milk tea bubble tea, and the hojicha had a very subtle chocolatey-coffee aftertaste. These both reminded me a bit of the flavours that one would taste at Kekou, except they don't melt as fast as Kekou's gelato. Would come back again to try their other flavours, or maybe a special cone."}
{"text":"I got the Cookie Monster and the ice cream itself was actually not bad at all! I really liked their presentation and really reminded me of the cookie monster. Besides the ice cream, the cookies and the cone were way too sweet and I couldn't even finish it all. It got too tiresome to eat by the end of it. Perhaps I'll try something next time that is a little bit lower on the sugar level."}
{"text":"I went during lunch time (1pm) with my co-workers and found that there was a lot of people. Fortunately, the line moved fast and we were all able to get our food. I got their signature cone (Cookie Monster) and while it looked amazing (definitely instagram quality ;) ), I did not really enjoy the taste of the ice cream. To be frank, it didn't really taste like anything other than having a faint taste of cookies n' cream. I definitely wish the ice cream was creamier and that the cone was more crunchy. So while it was a great looking ice cream that many of my friends recommended, I wish the ice cream tasted better."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying out this new place. 

Pros based on my experience: 
- The customer service person at the cashout was very friendly.

Feedback: 
- I got a scoop of the Cinnabomb ice cream; it had ground up cinnamon bun in it, which made the texture of the ice cream very grainy, and unfortunately the ice cream tasted very bland. I ended up throwing out the other half of the scoop. Maybe other ice cream flavours are better, but I can't speak to them.
- The service was very slow and disorganized, but then again, they just opened so hopefully they'll figure out how to be a bit more organized as they get into the swing of things.
- The layout of the menu on the wall is really pretty to look at, but was quite unclear. It might benefit from a bit of a redesign for clarity."}
{"text":"I highly recommend for the HK tea and those cheese tarts! Must be on your icecream shop in Toronto."}
{"text":"The ice cream is really high quality and delicious! I like that they have options to choose from, from the type of ice cream to the cones. Pricey but don't mind paying a little extra for quality. 

The girl taking the orders was very sweet, and explained the menu as it was our first time here. She encouraged us to sample the flavours to help us make a decision. Though I must mention, the store was not busy at the time. 

They were also serving free samples of their lava cheesecake which of course was just as delicious as the ice cream! 

Will definitely come back another time to try out all of the amazing combinations and flavours!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Came for doughnuts, but I don't consider these to be real doughnuts. They are those tiny machine created things, yes, the machine is fun to watch, but the doughnuts were actually undercooked. They were mushy fried dough, lacking flavor and structure. Basically just an overblown vehicle for toppings, and kind of expensive at that. They are cute, don't get me wrong, just not all that great. Adorable if you want to gift to someone! Less satisfying to actually eat. They are very slow at making these too, definitely order on Ritual or something if you want a bunch."}
{"text":"Very good service. Friendly staff.

I got the Thai and vanilla twist in a cup. The Thai ice cream didn't have as much flavour as kekou gelato. I had a sample of the hojicha ice cream and found that to be delicious. Will be back to try their Asian flavours!

Limited seating. 

Some of their menu limits are made to order so it will take around 15 minutes. I got my soft serve right away.

Accepts credit card."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you are ge- to be honest, the ice cream isn't very special and is only presented well for photos. Taste is mediocre at best, and the service wasn't particularly friendly either."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. Went here on a whim but there are much better ice cream places in Toronto so I don't think I'll be returning"}
{"text":"Was originally walking to Chatime, but it was too far and too hot out so we stopped here instead, and let me say, I was not disapointed at all. The staff was super friendly, and they let us try samples because it was our first time there. I got earl grey ice cream, and my boyfriend got the thai tea ice cream, and both were really good, and surprisingly light! The thai was a little too sweet for me, but earl grey was amazing. Needless to say, we're definitly stopping by again."}
{"text":"I went in there for their 1$, 1 scoop special and it was very good on a hot day. Especially after dinner. I had the cookie."}
{"text":"Fugo Desserts is a small, cute ice cream shop near St. Patrick station. Their cones are creative, and the atmosphere is nice and friendly. I had the Instagram famous \"Cookie Monster\" cone, and if you're wondering what's in the blue part of the cone, it's just dyed cookies and cream ice cream. It was a good consistency and it was delicious! They all offer soft serve, HK waffles, and all kinds of cool treats! My only complaint would be that the seating is a little uncomfortable, but that's not an issue for me. If Fugo (get it? lol bad pun), make sure to get there early, since the one can get long. :)"}
{"text":"Nothing like fresh donuts dressed up like chocolate bars and an ice cream to match to pick up your spirits on a grey day! Fugo makes their own mini donuts and creates mouthwatering ice creams too. This unassuming little joint packs a lot of flavor. The only problem is making up your mind. Screw that, just keep going back for a different taste adventure!"}
{"text":"I had a scoop of the cookie monster and my friends had the cheesecake on a stick and a scoop of the green tea ice cream concoction that they have. The cookies and cream is a lot of fun because of its blue base, and the cheesecake on a stick was amazing. Very very sweet. The green tea ice cream didn't really taste anything like green tea-my friends compared the flavour to Chatime's regular milk tea in ice cream form. The staff here is super friendly and they seem really excited about the products they offer. They are more than willing to answer your questions and explain or recommend the menu items. This place is for all the sweet tooths out there!"}
{"text":"Had the Bangkok Brownie the other day. Flavour is nice but texture as soft serve was on the icy and not as creamy as it can be. Good alternative to have in the city. Not sure what to make of the cake crumbs acts as the brownie."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that this ice cream tasted as good as the picture looks, but while the composition was incredibly presented, it just tasted average.

We visited on a Thursday evening around 8:00 PM, and it wasn't too busy. Service was incredibly sweet and helpful (the guy taking our order at the counter even showed me his Instagram to scroll through pictures of their various sundaes since it was our first time visiting).

We ended up ordering the Cookie Monster on a fudge cone (which was basically cookies and cream ice cream, but blue) with mini chocolate chip cookies tacked on around it. I normally like my ice cream dense, but not too dense. Unfortunately, this particular ice cream was so dense, we could barely bite into it. It was like ice. It also didn't taste anything too special - it wasn't very creamy at all, and the tough icy texture really took away from the experience.

Overall, because service was so pleasant, we wouldn't mind stoping by again if we're ever in the area, but we wouldn't go out of our way for it. Great concepts though - if they put in some work with improving the flavour and substance of the product, the experience here could be immensely better!"}
{"text":"Unique icecream flavors available!! If you enjoy tea flavored icecream, you would love this :) 

The menu is quite limited so that their creations are top notch. They also scoop up a lot of icecream so it's worth the cost!"}
{"text":"In short: creative and interesting ice cream, but basically overhyped.

Dropped by on a weeknight and happened to make it there when there was no lineup. Got lucky because by the time I got my ice cream, the lineup was almost to the door. Wow. Girl at the cash was pleasant and helpful, so +1 for the service.

I opted for the Cookie Monster after seeing all the photos of it floating around. And really, that's kind of their specialty here -- making ice cream that looks instagram/snapchat/social media worthy. But honestly, that's about it, that's kinda all there is to it. I'll give them a point for aesthetics and creativity, but apart from that, I don't see where all the hype is. 

The cookies were fine but nothing special. As for the ice cream, the flavour was so faint that I couldn't even make out what it was supposed to be. Maybe a really bland vanilla with just a hint of sweetness, dyed blue just to make it photo-worthy? I have no idea, but I wasn't overly impressed. The best part of the whole thing though was the dipped cone; that tasted awesome.

My friends opted for some other options, and while there was general agreement that the ice cream tasted pleasant, they could not understand why this place gets so much attention."}
{"text":"Some might say Fugo is Instagram worthy, but if you're here for the food, I can tell you right away that their menu items do not live up to the hype. The Thai tea soft serve had no cone and an extremely stingy portion in a cup, and only a hint of the tea came through. The Cookie Monster had an amazing presentation, but completely lacked flavour. The Cookie Monster tasted like nothing: no creaminess, and not even a hint of vanilla; quite honestly, I felt like I was eating ice. I do not think the pricing is justified. Disappointed! However, if you want to take an Instagram photo or watch a ton of people finding a nice spot on the wall to take their Instagram photos, this is definitely the place to be. Otherwise, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times in the past few weeks and have noticed that not everything on the menu is available for order. The most recent time I went half of the hard ice cream flavours were not available. Staff is friendly and does their job well. A notable point about fugo is that their desserts are instagram ready, if that's your thing.

The decor is just enough to make you feel comfortable, but nothing spectacular. The seating area is cozy and bright but when you look back to where the desserts are being prepared it looks just like a regular kitchen, which kind of ruins the magic. 

The thai tea soft serve had great flavour but not the smoothest consistency. It was slightly grainy, but not to the point where it was unenjoyable. The vanilla soft serve which is one of the best i've ever had; flavourful and smooth despite being a tad melty, which I enjoyed as a part of the honeycomb sundae.   

I also tried the hojicha hard scoops, which boasts a great toasty green tea flavour, but had some ice chunks in it and could be creamier.

The cones taste reasonable fresh, but should be better constructed since they are very prone to drippage.

Will probably come back due to its location."}
{"text":"Really disappointed, but I'm hoping my review is the odd one out. I was so excited to try this place after seeing other reviews and instagrams but unfortunately it was oversold to me. I ordered the Cookies and Dreams cone ($6.99) and it was supposed to come with the fancy Fugo cone (the unique thing they're known for!), but they neglected to tell us they were out of them. When I asked midway through our wait she said that they were indeed out, but did not give us a refund or any discount. The cone itself costs $2.49 and is included in the listed price. So ultimately we paid $7 for a two scoop cone with 2 oreos and a chocolate piece on top. 
The ice cream itself was also highly mediocre. It's definitely unique (Skor + Brownie for the one I got), but there were no actual Skor or Brownie chunks in it. It should be renamed Vanilla with fudge ripple or something. As a chocolate fiend I was really disappointed to see a vanilla cone being handed my way. And due to the mediocre quality and lack of actual chocolate in it, I didn't actually finish mine. 
All in all, will not be coming back.

EDIT: Immediately after posting, the owner was in contact to offer a solution. Jethro kindly inquired and listened to the situation, apologized and offered compensation. Also to note: the staff were all very friendly there, it was the negligence that made my experience less than enjoyable. Will be returning earlier in the day sometime to try the Fugo cone. Note for others: Don't go ~8pm because the cones consistently sell out, apparently!"}
{"text":"expected nothing but the best product and customer service for the premium price - fell way short. consider this to be an inflated 'tiny tom's' at downtown toronto prices. 

customer service is based solely on how much you spend in the shop. a very elitist and unnecessarily stuck up staff. 

donuts are of low quality. coffee is sub-par.

with plenty of donut places popping up all over the city, I wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"This place was good, but seriously over-hyped. I will say that their ice cream is definitely Instagram worthy (which would probably mean more to me if I had it), but definitely not on the list of top ice cream places in the city.

I ordered the earl grey ice cream. It did taste like earl grey, but wasn't quite as smooth as other ice cream. My friend ordered the thai tea ice cream with the brownie! It was also good, but not all that special. Overall, everything was a little too sweet for me, but maybe I'm old."}
{"text":"Fugo ice cream had me when I first saw it on instagram. It was on my list to go to place after work.  Came here after school a couple months back but only waited till now to write a review since I'm actually craving it again. For the price the portions are a bit bigger then the ice cream joints elsewhere. I ordered the honey ice cream and they actually have honey comb. 

Being the clumsy me, I have paid for my ice cream and stood aside with my friend waiting patiently for my ice cream to be made, but I was way to excited and dropped the whole thing on the counter.  However they were kind enough to make me a brand new one! Winter won't stop me from eating ice cream!!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to try Fugo for quite some time! I actually saw a ton of people holding their massive ice cream cones on the streets, so of course I had to visit Fugo to get in on the trend. 

It opens in the afternoon (3 pm), which is a really odd time in my opinion. There was a lot of people inside, and generally the interior was quite messy from ice cream droplets and crumbs from cones. It would be nice if it was a little cleaner. The decoration really only consisted of a gigantic wall chalk mural, and children can doodle all over if they wanted to. 

The ice cream comes in very generous portions, but the entire time I was eating my cone, I felt immense fear that my ice cream scoop would fall off onto the ground. My Cookie Monster ice cream tasted quite milky, and it was adorned with crispy mini cookies. The ice cream was fun and creamy- I love how you can pick your cone (either s'mores or chocolate). Just an FYI, the Cookie Monster dyed my lips blue! I couldn't wash it off, and the color slowly transitioned to black. We also got the Cookies n' Dream, which is delicious and comes with cute oreos and hersheys bars. 

I'm really excited to try out the other flavors, and hopefully when I come back it'll be less crowded!"}
{"text":"It's their cones that keep me coming back but maybe less often now because their cones are not as good as when they first opened as they have cut down the amount of toppings and isn't really worth it anymore. Their ice cream is alright - slightly on the sugary sweet and softer side. (Haven't tried their soft serve.)

Their mini doughnuts were highly disappointing. I was lured in by the cuteness of it all and how each doughnut was decorated like a full size but most of the toppings tasted funny - there was potential but they fell short of being amazing. Also, their donuts themselves, aren't that great. 

P.S. Their doughnut making machine is polluting the store's air and it needs better ventilation, that's why you typically see they have their door propped open."}
{"text":"I saw the cookie monster ice cream cone on Instagram and it was love at first sight.  I knew I had to eat it and I DID.  Fugos has 3.5 stars at the time of this review and I don't think it does the shop or the cookie monster any justice.  It's a cool shop with chairs to hang out.  It's a happy little ice cream store.  Now to the cookie monster.  It's as good as the pictures.  Creamy and tasty.  The chocolate chip cookies could be tastier but the ice cream makes up for that.  Cookie monster does make your tongue blue but you know that cause you made the decision to eat a Sesame Street character.  I tried the cookie n' dreams and the cookie monster is my preferred choice.  I can't wait to try more of their creations!"}
{"text":"There's ALWAYS room for yummy ice cream!

The newly renovated space is pretty, but even smaller than before. It's simple and modern. 

I got the hojicha (taste amazing!) and London fog (earl grey taste is there, but it doesn't linger)."}
{"text":"I came here once on a hot summer afternoon and ordered the Cookie Monster. Visually it's a fun treat, but taste wise, it's nothing special. It's also a very messy ordeal. 

I appreciate the creativity and the chance to act like a child again. But it's still an ice cream shop, and I haven't wanted to go back for a second visit. 

2.5 stars out of 5. 

Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:
[*] Disappointing. Just...no. 
[**] Not very good. Will not return. 
[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. 
[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. 
[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Not great, not terrible. 
I came here with two friends, knowing that I wanted to get the cookie monster ice cream I kept seeing on instagram. In my opinion, it was pretty overpriced and not worth the hype but still good and it did look nice so +1 for presentation. 
My friends had more trouble because as they pointed to flavours on the menu, they kept being told they were sold out....seems a little weird to be out of over half the menu early in the day?

I might come back here, but I think there are other places with more selection that could be better."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is slightly overrated. :/ We came on a Wednesday evening, so the line up wasn't too bad. 

Earl grey soft serve: well flavored but texture wasn't creamy enough, too icy.

The Cookie Monster ice cream: it's just food coloring, you know that right!? Haha but yahhh okay, it's cute! 

Not sure if I'll come back... The staff seemed a little bit disorganized, they forgot one of the orders from our group... Overall mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I got the Hong Kong milk tea ice cream and it was delicious. Strong flavours and it hit the spot. Satisfying on a hot day or after a full meal. We also got Thai iced tea soft serve but that fell short for us. It was a little bland but I feel like that's what usually happens with soft serve ice cream in general. Would like to try the cookies and cream Cookie Monster special (they dye the ice cream blue!)"}
{"text":"Fugo is about a 10 minute walk from the Eaton Centre! To be honest, I was expecting a lot more from the ice cream they offer only to realize some of the items they showcase on their Instagram aren't always served.

However, I tried out 2 different tea flavours, the Thai milk tea and hong kong milk tea. Both were very intricate flavours that had a nice touch of asian infusion attached to them. The Thai milk tea had a stronger tea taste while the Hong Kong milk tea was creamier and a little more sweet. Both tasted REALLY REALLY good and I can't believe how fast I finished the scoops.

The staff were very friendly and patient. Personally, I am very indecisive and the staff walked me through their entire menu and told me his recommendations as well as the popular items there. They also have an iPad mini opened to their Instagram page to showcase what they have to offer which is a super cute touch!

If I were to come back I would definitely try the specialty cones and the donuts!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here last night to fulfill my ice cream craving. I came just for the Cookie Monster cone, but we got there a little late and they only had enough ice cream to make 1 scoop of it, they were nice enough to substitute the other scoop with Cookies N' Dreams. It's a bit pricey but it's still really good."}
{"text":"I think the shop is really cute, with the entire blackboard wall and clean design. Parts of their menu is on the wall, but it was hard to read since it's amidst a lot of random customer doodles.
I got the cookies and dream swapped with earl grey ice cream. The ice cream was delightful, the intensity of the earl grey was just right. It was huge and definitely not meant for one person to finish. 
I find everything a little too gimmicky. The ice cream was nice, but the whole special creation part just felt some some Oreo cookies were threw in as an afterthought to make the whole thing instagram worthy. I thought my mediocre cone would be cause I swapped out the flavour but my friends's wasn't too far off from disappointing. 
She got the Cookie Monster which was a tinted blue cookies and cream creation with mini cookies. She also thought the ice cream didn't have much wow factor beyond its looks.
Everything tasted okay, but I wanted something more. The marketing was too enticing and you feel like you got that half empty bag of chips."}
{"text":"Cute little dessert spot any one in Toronto would want to check out. The menu is quite small but all flavours are unique and have interesting combinations. I got the cookie monster double scoop and it was really good, the flavour is not very prominent but it was good it had the oreo, cookie and cream flavour. At the end you do get a blue stain on your lips- if you like that kind of stain. I really enjoyed the oreo waffle cone it was bomb! I initially wanted to grab their egg tarts as well but because of the spring/summer season they dont serve it- only served in the winter months ): 
Overall its a good dessert shop thats creative and tastes good."}
{"text":"I went on a dessert date with a friend after hanging around the area and we were not disappointed! Although the price is a bit high for a sundae, I have to say that the servings for everything else on their menu were quite large, and I honestly don't mind paying the price for a yummy treat once in a while!

I had their Good Morning sundae and it was so refreshing and a great way to mix both my love of ice cream and iced coffee!

I can't wait to return and try something else.

My only \"complaint\" is that it was a little crowded due to the size of their location, and hard to find a seat, and when we did get a seat, the woman had left a broken cone and her napkins all over the table in a sticky mess. She didn't even attempt to clean before she left! But that isn't Fugo's fault, that's just customers being a butt.

If it isn't super hot outside, their items are easy to eat and walk with it!

If you come with a big group of friends, have a plan to sit elsewhere or go someplace else after you receive your order. There's about 2-3 tables and a window area to sit at, but it's only good for couples or singles. I can't imagine having more than 3 people in a party in such a small area!"}
{"text":"In terms of taste, it looks better than it tastes but it's still decent. Their soft serves like the earl grey and Thai iced tea wins over their hard ice cream for me.

Overall, it's a good addition to the Yonge/ Dundas neighbourhood for desserts but to make it great, I think better quality control would get the 4 stars from me. E.g. Consistency in using gloves when handling food, don't serve the ice cream if it has flakes of ice in it and throw out cones if they are stale (lost its crunch)."}
{"text":"I tried the cookies 'n dream ice cream at Fugo Desserts. The portions are very generous as they give you two large scoops of skor brownie ice cream. The cookies 'n dream one also comes with Oreo cookies and white Hersey chocolate pieces carefully placed around the ice cream. The rim of the waffle cone is also covered in Oreo crumbles. For good quality control, I saw the guy making the desserts ask his coworker if it looked good before serving each order. The dessert is definitely picture worthy. However, I found this to be way too sweet. I couldn't finish the whole thing and had to share it. 

In terms of service, the staff were pretty friendly and the wait time wasn't too long. It was maybe 15 minutes when I went. They also have limited seating inside if you decide to dine in. It was definitely cool to try but it's not a place I would purposely come back to."}
{"text":"Oh Fugo, Fugo, Fugo...how much I wanted to like you. I came in to only a couple in front of me for line up on a Friday afternoon. Quick. I ordered a Cookie Monster. I do not recall if I gave them my name or if they give you a number and then shout out the number...nonetheless they call you when its ready. A cookie monster is a scooped gourmet ice cream cone. It had two top scoops and ice cream inside the cone as well. The blue is entirely food colouring (its cookies and cream ice cream). Topped with oreos and a blinged out Fugo cone. It was...decent. Not worth its value though. My two friends both got the Bangkok Brownie, a soft serve ice cream. It was a unique flavour I've never had before. I preferred that over my Cookie Monster. Get a scooped cone if you want it for the Gram, I guess. It's more worth it for me to try unique flavors with their prices, so I'd recommend the Bangkok Brownie. Light, not too sweet, has a tea aftertaste. I enjoyed it, but like most soft serve, it melted a bit too quickly, so eat fast, but not before you take a picture to show it's aesthetics!"}
{"text":"As of late I have started thinking about more than *just* food and (basic) service for places I visit. Sometimes, it is nice to visit a place that reminds you that other factors matter to, such as the interior, for example. That is what Fugo was a good reminder of.

Ok, first thing's first - doughnuts rock. Their doughnuts are tasty, no question about it. Good variety, decent prices. When they are fresh, they taste great, when not fresh, they're ok. Overall a good deal.

My issue is the ventilation (weird, right?). Unless you will, quite literally, jump in to order and leave somehow within a minute, you will be marked with the lovely stench of deep fried doughnuts. You'd think that's not a bad deal, but trust me... it is. I have done this twice and both times came out smelling like something I'd never want to smell. Sure, I enjoyed the doughnuts, sure they are friendly in there, but for the love of god, figure out a way not to make your space and your customers smell so bad. 

Next time, I'll call ahead and order so I can literally jump in, pay, and get the heck outta there."}
{"text":"i just wanted a Pablo tart and got the cheese tart here to fill in for my desperation; fell far from it; on an upside, Pablo will be coming to Toronto soon!  the lineups for that will be immense; so perhaps Fugo; take this in point and step up the game; these tarts in general were just... average and I don't know if I just have high expectations, but i think it could be much better or just price them cheaper"}
{"text":"S'mores cheesecake on stick was not bad. Especially the cover was really good. However it seems like the cheesecake itself is the frozen one from the supermarket."}
{"text":"I love you guys so much. My waistline doesn't thank you, however. My friend and I came in, not knowing anything about what they served (contrary to popular belief, I am an Asian who does not understand the concept of food pictures and therefore never checks Instagram for suggestions), and the girl working the register is an absolute devil. 

She suggested that we should try out the Bangkok Brownie and the Crispy Comb. It was...so good. I myself preferred the Crispy Comb over the Bangkok Brownie. 

While the Thai milk tea ice cream was so good, it was so rich with the brownie layers and chocolate syrup that we got overwhelmed after a few bites. I mean, it never stopped us from polishing it off... I think next time I'll get the Thai milk tea ice cream on its own.

Now...my favourite of the two-- Crispy Comb. They have cornflakes which break up the smooth sweetness of the vanilla ice cream interlaced with the syrupy honeycomb piece nestled oh-so-gently in the soft swirls of vanilla ice cream. Ohhhhh myyyyy Godddddd."}
{"text":"I wasn't really into the fancy dessert cones they had and just wanted to try the ice cream. I got the thai tea which came as a soft serve, and I got a  small and i got itt in a waffle cone. The waffle cone is $1 and in total I paid $5..so $4 for some soft serve...and it didn't even taste like thai tea. It almost didn't have any flavor at all except a hint of milk. Just not good."}
{"text":"The soft serve (I got vanilla and thai tea- next time I'd get just vanilla, which is completely fantastic) with cornflakes was little short of orgasmic. Perfect blend of flavours and textures. Really, really nice people too."}
{"text":"The Cookie Monster and the cookies and cream are both addicting...I think it has something to do with that dangerously good mallow they use to stick candy bits at the top of the cone...soo good!!! All in all I love this plAce, I would only wish they have separate price options for single scoops...I always have to pay full price ($7) for a single scoop because otherwise it is too much for me.......seems a bit unfair...."}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures on Instagram, I knew I had to come here when I visited Toronto. The place is pretty small, but there are some seats and it was not too crowded when I came here so I did not have to wait a long time. 

They have unique flavors that look amazing photographed. I got the Cookies N' Dream which was cookies and cream flavored ice cream with toppings. The top scoop was a bit lopsided and I was so scared it might fall off but as long as you eat it indoors it won't melt super quickly and you won't have a mess. The ice cream itself was pretty tasty and creamy and it was perfect for Instagram. 

Price wise it was about $8 (I think) which came seem kind of pricey but honestly all the instagram-able hype ice cream tend to be around that price. Overall, I really liked the ice cream and the vibe of the place and I would def. come back to try out some other flavors."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots for ice cream. Came back for some ice cream today and was disappointed with the quality now. The ice cream was still creamy but not had ice bits inside them. The genmaicha flavour was not strong enough but the houjicha was ok. I got them on a s'mores cone. The cone was good. It seems like the ice cream here got a little sweeter. Portions have also seem like it shrunk too. 

The cheese tarts are not worth it. They are not the same ones as the ones I've see in pictures. The ones I got seem smaller and did not melt it. It felt thicker and flatter than the ones in picture. It was dry. So disappointed. Not worth $6.76 for two when they're so tiny. 

-1 star for lack of flavour and ice bits in my ice cream. 
-1 stars for overpriced lava cheese tarts that do not really melt. 

I used to love this place but now I give my experience here a 3 now stars"}
{"text":"Went there today to get some ice cream due to the decent reviews on here. Been to Italy more than 20 times and have therefore quite some references. But I think it's not worth the price (or the hype). But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Had their soft serve ice cream with cheesecake that was frozen. Nothing special, just over priced soft serve. I think they sell mini donuts now, so will have to try that"}
{"text":"Convenient location, delicious flavors. However, there are a million ice shards in the icecream here, so every bite is crunchy..."}
{"text":"Ordered the lava cheese tart.  They made it fresh so about 10 to 15 minutes wait.  Too sweet and watery inside. Didn't like it."}
{"text":"BAM awesome flavours!
BAM not expensive!
BAM friendly service!

Fugo's got it all! 

Right off the bat, what I like about Fugo is that they've got a reasonably-sized menu. Places like Chatime go big with choices and customisation, but you could also easily get trapped into the I-don't-know-what-I-want rut. Although Fugo's menu is small (2 pager), don't be fooled - it's a hit list: every item on there will make you want to try it, from the S'mores and marshmallow cone to their London Fog soft serve. It's almost feels like Fugo narrowed down their current from a list of 50 offerings to only include the best hits. 

The people who run the store are super friendly and are happy to explain their menu. Service is quick. I've had their HK milk tea 2 scoops  with marshmallows melted on top of it and it was seriously soooooo good. I liked it better than Kekou (whoa what!). I don't particularly crave ice cream in the winter, but Fugo's just so good! 

My only grievance is that here's no space to sit. It's a grab-and-go place, which makes sense given the nature of its offerings, but sometimes it's nice just to be able to have a seat to lounge for 20 mins."}
{"text":"If you've tried all 31 flavors of Baskin & Robbins, and all the combinations of marble slab, try this place out!

They don't have as many options as compared to the 2 big chains (and others) but their ice cream is still pretty yummy! I have tried their cookie monster (left my tongue blue lol) and smores on smores (has melted n toasted Marshmellow covering it.

The place small hence there isn't room for a big hangout. Being in the city the intention could be to pick up your ice cream and walk and eat (which IMO is a good thing for a date except in winter).

It is pricey but you get your money's worth as the scoops are big and the cones are not the average ones. 

To sum it up: Enjoyable ice cream, good alternative!"}
{"text":"Mmmm! Do yourself a favour and treat yourself to a scoop or two from Fugo. This little joint has all the charm of a local business from the chalkboard menu to the polite, helpful staff who will save you from all the brain scratching you'll do from picking a flavour.

I ordered 2 scoops of Earl Grey complimented by corn flakes. I am a die hard fan of earl grey. So naturally I was uncertain that their ice cream would do a good ol' London fog justice, and boy, they nailed it. Delicious with the right spicy-sweet, perfume essence.

From what it seems, you can't go wrong with the menu. Will be back again when the warm weather calls!"}
{"text":"Not much to say
The cones we got tasted soo good, but i think it was a bit much lol
lol sugar over loooad. So if you plan to make a visit don't eat too much or any sweets for the day.
I think the prices for what you get are really good as well
They need more help though, when I went the line wasn't too long but because they take so long making the cones the line just grew and grew.
Customer Service wise they are very friendly and patient with you . I mean there is so much to choose from and all these different toppings
I'll definitely be back, its a great treat!"}
{"text":"Summer is on its way, and its time to hit your favourite ice cream spots again! 
Love their creative ideas and flavours in which you typically dont get everywhere.  And theyre also very photogenic. But if you go late theyll sell out. Love their speciality cones and bangkok thai soft serve. The cookie monster is what lured me here lol"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Dundas St W and University Ave. No free parking in direct vicinity, but there were a bunch of parking lots and street parking in the area. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Staff were friendly. I was amused because one guy took orders at the cash register and also flipped the donuts to make sure they cooked evenly in the mini donut fryer. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
Modern, clean and minimalistic. Very small, and had a few bar stools by the window. Seating area was limited, so this was a great spot to order treats to go.

[QUALITY] - 5/5
Every single mini donut was inspected for quality, and topped with delicious and sweet treats! 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- 6 Specialty Mini Donuts - $5.50: We ordered the following flavours: (1) Great Canadian Pig (2) Maple Walnut (3) Chocolate Pistachio (4) Resse's (5) Campfire S'mores (6) Lemon Meringue. All mini donuts were fluffy and had the perfect amount of sweetness. The best one is definitely the Lemon Meringue because it tasted light, sweet and tangy! 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
A great place for a little pick-me-up. I would definitely recommend this place for their fresh specialty mini donuts."}
{"text":"3.5 

Fugo has great ice cream creations (like cookie monster, s'mores, Bangkok brownie and more), with inspiration from around the world. Great fusion flavours like milk tea, honey comb, or churros with soft serve that look great in foodie pics! 

However, it is quite pricey. 4 stars if it were a bit moderately priced. Definitely a fun place to visit that I will return to."}
{"text":"The line was pretty long when I got there on a Tuesday Afternoon. The staff are friendly but they took a bit too long to take and process my order. The scoops are not too large and not really worth it.

The Hojicha is soso but the Jasmine Milk Tea is decent. Next time I will try the cookie monster."}
{"text":"Fugohmygod. 

This place is heavenly. Let's talk portions first - this could be a full meal in and of itself due to the sheer amount of sweets packed into one dessert. 

My group had the Cookies N Dreams and the Bangkok Brownie (they were sold out of Smores!!!). Fair warning, the Bangkok Brownie is their soft serve and is not in their delicious cone. It's a tea-infused orange soft serve with chocolate here there and everywhere. With its colour and sweetness, it should probably be called Halloween or Treat-or-Treat. 

I was jealous of my friends because they got the cone. The ice cream was good and all but I just kept eating that cone. The marshmallow aftertaste is strong in this one and I find myself still craving it while writing this review............ I need s'more. 

I'm pretty happy to see places like this spring up closer to the centre of downtown (other than Sweet Jesus). I know Tsujiri is just down the street, but if you're looking for something filling and delicious (for a great price - just $6.99 for the specialty ones), I wouldn't hesitate to Fugo in here."}
{"text":"Ordered the cookie monster and it was nothing special. Just regular cookie dough ice cream with blue food colouring. That makes your lips and tongue blue."}
{"text":"To the owners and masterminds behind Fugo Desserts -  where have you been my entire life? And can you open up a second location near my workplace?

I visited two times and my experience both times has been nothing short of fantastic. Although there was a line (understandable because they just recently opened their doors to the public), the employees and the owners were friendly, courteous, and even let me try some of their flavours before I made a decision! 

The first time I ordered the Cookie Monster, which is one of their specialties (for good reason). Served in an Oreo crusted waffle cone, it has two scoops of blue Cookies & Cream ice cream topped with mini Chips Ahoy cookies. I was supposed to go to dinner afterwards, but decided against it after finishing the cone. You'll be very satisfied with it and their menu wall is perfect for snapping the picture for Instagram! I couldn't believe that they even had a Snapchat geofilter! These guys know how to do social media right. 

The second time, I ordered the Crispy Comb, which is vanilla soft serve, served in a cup, with layers of corn flakes, real honey comb, honey drizzle, topped with matcha sprinkles. This was, by far, the best ice cream I've ever had in Toronto. The amazing texture and flavour of the soft serve, coupled with just the right amount of sweetness and crunch make the Crispy Crunch a really playful and classic dessert that I think should be a permanent stay on their menu!

It's centrally located at the intersection of University and Dundas, and I'm happy that I can easily go down to get my dessert fix whenever I have a craving. I just wish that I worked in the area so I could go whenever I felt like it! The portions are very fair for the price you pay, and seeing the owners put in a new batch of ice cream in the soft serve machine every now and then reassures you that you're paying for quality and freshness. 

Definitely a must try - even if you have to travel!"}
{"text":"Im still thinking about the ice cream I had and I cant wait to go back! Tried the \"Cookies n Dreams\" on a waffle cone surrounded with oreo pieces and marshmallow fluff and my oh my.... My biggest regret is telling them 1 scoop instead of the standard 2 scoops. Im still kicking myself for thinking about saving calories while eating ice cream (silly me, I know). The skor ice cream (used in Cookies n Dreams) was incredible. You would imagine that the ice cream may be too sweet, especially with oreos and hersheys cookies n cream chocolate as toppings, but surprisingly it wasnt. It was perfect."}
{"text":"The earl grey ice cream here is so amazing. It's the best earl grey flavoured treat I've ever had and this is coming from a huge earl grey fan. Usually earl grey flavoured items are never done right either too bland or you can barely taste the tea flavour but this ice cream was spot on. Will be returning soon :)"}
{"text":"Fugo has so many different Asian inspired flavors and my favorite one would have to be the HK Milk tea. All of them are really good, but the reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes they're sold out of certain flavors and it's a win or lose situation if you're planning on going to try one specific flavor. But everything else is great! Friendly and helpful service , good ice cream,  and the store is super cute. Keep in mind that the store does only have around 10 seats , so if you plan on staying there, be prepared to stand during busy hours :)"}
{"text":"Haven't heard of this place, went in on a whim with a friend who was on a mission to find something sweet. Honestly I really enjoyed it. We ordered 6 mini donuts (Mini homer, s'mores and cookies & cream) and I had a scoop of the Earl Grey ice-cream and it was quite tasty. 
The man at the counter was patient while we picked what we wanted which was also a plus. Nice little sit in space (which was empty since it was early on a weekday). 
Overall I had a good experience here, plan on coming back with my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream and dessert place all year round!

I had their Bangkok brownie soft serve and their Japanese cheese tart, and omg the thai milk tea flavour was on point! Their cheese tart imo was better than Pablo's ( I was very disappointed in my first Pablo experience in Korea...). Every time I come back, there's always a new innovation or ice cream flavour so I definitely recommend coming often!"}
{"text":"Fugo is a tiny shop on Dundas St. West near University Avenue that sells uniquely crafted ice cream creations. Placing emphasis on visual presentation as well as taste, the cones here definitely have potential to please ice cream and soft serve lovers alike. Judging by the lineups that tend to form and the sold out flavours, this joint is already a hit with some. There's a cool vibe you can feel as soon as you approach the door.

I haven't tried the soft serve just yet, but the scoops and cones are delicious in my experience.  The menu is split between classic North American style scoops topped with popular cookie and chocolate bar treats, and flavours that are Asian fusion influenced, like Jasmine Milk Tea.

If you're lucky enough to stop by when they're not busy, service is fast and friendly. Cones aren't very expensive, which means for $5-8 (taxes included) you can grab yourself enough to satisfy that sweet tooth. Fugo is probably better suited for a young, hip audience, so if Instagram-worthy ice cream isn't what you're looking for, you may end up feeling out of place. Aside from that, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Under new management with new mini donut station! Didn't get the chance to try this place before but happy with the current business. They have about 4 window seats and 1 small table for 2. There was constant flow of traffic so I was lucky to land the table. 

I had the hot chocolate with roasted marshmallows with teddy Graham crackers. Very tasty but also super sweet. I ordered the Thai iced tea soft serve with brownie bits and the flavouring wasn't very strong and generally didn't really impress me. It also came in the cup which was a bit disappointing. My friend had the cookie monster and it remains the crowd pleaser. The ice cream amazingly didn't melt for a solid 15 minutes. We were literally in awe of the quality of the ice cream. Service was friendly and very quick despite how busy it was. I tried pretty much all 16 flavours of the mini donuts and my favourites were the pistachio, lemon meringue, s'mores and maple walnut. If you buy more than 6 donuts, it is tax free.

Will definitely return to try some more ice cream or get the mini donuts as a gift. But not the Thai iced tea soft serve."}
{"text":"I got the coconut cream pie cheese cake on a stick and it was so good. Would definitely come back and try other flavours and their ice cream. The venue is really small so it's ideal just to buy something and walk around with it outside."}
{"text":"Got the cookie monster cone and for $8 it was ... meh. 

The cookie monster cone is a cookies and cream waffle cone with two scoops of cookies and cream ice cream topped with mini chips ahoy cookies - nothing special. I'm glad I tried it once to get on the Instagram hype train, but it's probably not somewhere I'd come back to when I'm craving ice cream."}
{"text":"Came by at 7ish on a Saturday. However they said they're closed although business hours say they're open until 10?"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the place! When I went there it was 2 people operating it. One of them makes EDM tracks and they were blasting it. As a festival junkie it made me happy, probably not fitting for a ice cream shop but it didn't matter haha. The cashier and person serving the ice cream were both really into the music as you could see them bopping their heads to the beat!

I got the Thai milk tea soft serve and my friend got the classic Cookie Monster, total came to around $13 both in a waffle cone. The Cookie Monster is a blue dyed version of a cookies and cream and the waffle cone for it was really unique, it had a rim of oreo cookies and made it taste that extra bit better. For myself they screwed up my order and gave my ice cream in a cup, but didn't hesitant to make me a new one! 

Both tasted amazing and relatively cheap. They have a lot of different types of milk teas and it's definitely worth a try, if you've never tried it before. It was just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I love donuts: Soft, fresh vehicles-for-a-heart attack are my favourites! I stopped in with a friend tonight after dinner for some tea and dessert and was really impressed.

They make the donuts near the cash, so you can see that they're fresh. They were composed to order, which was nice. They were out of a few flavours, so we got lemon meringue, toasted coconut amd the Homer Simpson. They were all stunning!

The donut itself was still warm, and soft enough that it dissolved on your tongue. The lemon curd played nicely with the freshly browned meringue piped on top. The toasted coconut added texture to the chocolate glaze's hint of sweetness. And the Homer was the most surprising of all: the icing had a lovely berry flavour that wasn't hidden by too much sugar. Shocking! Even the sprinkles were a great addition.

In all, we were really impressed. The server (wish I had gotten her name) was especially sweet, and gave some some samples of the cinnamon sugar donuts. I'm going back this week, and I'm bringing friends!"}
{"text":"The interior was clean, and the ice-cream themselves were very instagrammable. Personally, I have a major sweet tooth, but even I found the ice-cream from Fugo Desserts to be overwhelmingly sweet. It's not for me!"}
{"text":"Pictures of Fugo Desserts on Instagram are E-P-I-C! In actuality, Fugo's ice cream tends to photograph better than it tastes. 

My companion and I tried the Thai Milk Tea and Earl Grey soft serve. The Thai Milk Tea has a sweet condense milk flavour . The Earl Grey has a robust Earl Grey flavour. However, both flavours were slightly icy compare to other ice cream soft serve outlets. They lacked the smooth creamy textures of soft serves. 

Although I appreciate the unique flavours, I prefer more luxurious ice creams from other dessert outlets in the city."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and tried the donuts and I got the cookie monster ice cream cone. It's quite well done with a kings of cookies embedded in it. I do  wish it was available on a cup because I had to finish it quick or risk ice cream dripping all  over my hand . While the ice cream had a nice taste what I liked was how attractive it was. I won't mind coming  back to try soft serves since I liked some of the flavours on the menu."}
{"text":"To be honest there's really nothing too special about this place other than taking a good Instagram pic to post.

Their Cookie Monster ice cream is cookies and cream flavour so your just east blue cookies and cream ice cream."}
{"text":"The staff at fugo were incredibly nice and chill. I ordered the soft serve Thai ice cream and was blown away by the flavour. However the only downside was that it melted very quickly and dripped everywhere within a couple of minutes.

My friends ordered the cookies and dream and the cookie monster. They both looked fantastic and tastes amazing. Even the cones were spectacular; it was chewy and crunchy at the same time. However although the cookie monster looked great?it was just cookies and cream ice cream. It turned my friends entire mouth blue."}
{"text":"5 stars for presentation but the actual ice cream isn't much better than something from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Small dessert shop in Toronto that makes unique flavoured ice cream. Holla at the Schulich creators! 
We only got the Cookie Monster plus a genmaicha scoop in a cup. I'm generally not a big fan of eating ice cream with cones as it gets too messy. If you're doing it for the Insta, the cone and extra cookies makes it more legit looking. Cookie Monster wasn't anything special. It still tasted pretty good but it's probably just food colouring to make it super blue WHICH stains the tongue and lips. Grab a spoon if you don't want a blue mouth.
The genmaicha tasted decent. Little plain, didn't have a strong taste to it.. was quite subtle."}
{"text":"Got the Cookie Monster here. The ice cream portions are huge. The flavor is creamy and not too sweet. Definitely must try. Presentation of the ice cream is great. They are Instagram worthy."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch on a really hot day so there was a long line up with 1 guy behind  the cash and also making the ice cream. I'm not sure if this is how busy it is usually. I feel like I ordered the wrong thing but I wasn't very impressed with Fugo. I had the small Thai ice tea (soft serve only) on a Fugo Oreo cone. It ended being about $7. While it did taste like Thai ice tea, there wasn't anything special about it otherwise. They do have cones that make for a nice picture though if you snap it before it melts!"}
{"text":"Great dessert, unique ice cream flavours at a reasonable price. If you're in the area definitely stop by and have some ice cream! I got the smores ice cream cone it was delicious, not too sweet and not to marshmallowy."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for the earl grey soft serve. There were definitely earl grey notes but it was watered down so much that in this weather turned into a pool of slush before I could truly enjoy the flavour. 

From what I could taste, it was pretty subtle and there was not much cream. The portion size is bigger then anticipated, $5 large size. However, I think I would have liked the ice cream more. The cashier was knowledgable and asked if I wanted a sample to try a twist. Though, it is kinda awkward when he asked for a tip when it was not like he waited on me or anything, giving me a sample does not warrant a tip! 

There are definitely better ice cream places around even though this one was 'interesting' for its unique flavours."}
{"text":"Three stars because a bit over priced and over hyped ice cream place. 

I'm a huge ice cream fan or desserts in general so I KNOW my sweets. HAH 

I ordered the cookies n dream ice cream cone hoping for a burst of Oreo cookie flavors but it was your simple basic vanilla ice cream with a few, very sparse brownie bit and Oreos. 
There was no WOW factor to this ice cream especially since it was almost 10 dollars I was hoping for more but was let down. Sad."}
{"text":"I came here for a $1 scope ice cream, however, I found the ice cream just an OK. My friend and I ordered cookie monster, which taste not that special.
I personally like Sweet Jesus or KeKou better."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with my luck and avoiding Fugo's lineups but the three times I've walked past it and the two times I've visited it, there was basically no one in the store apart from myself and one other person. 

The first time I got the Cookie Monster and it was good, I liked the concept of it and the presentation was really cute. The downside of it was the food colouring I'm assuming? Because my washroom journeys took me to new heights - blue poop. Yup, as gross as that was, it is what it is. 

My second visit let me try the individual scoops. Many of the flavours were sold out so I didn't get to try the jasmine milk tea. The scoops of the ice cream were fairly small but decently priced. Two scoops was about ~$4? My hojicha ice cream was nice, though my friend who tried a bit said the tea flavour was a bit on the mild side. It wasn't overly sweet which was a plus for me. Her Thai ice tea soft serve tasted the same as the Thai roll ice cream from Arctic bites but slightly sweeter. 

Overall, it's not bad, especially for the price. Service is quick, but like all ice cream parlours, the lack of seating is an issue for those who want to shy away from the sun."}
{"text":"I scream.  You scream.  We all scream for ice cream.  Lol.  Well, my brain was screaming for Thai Tea flavour ice cream, and Fugo is the only place i know to have this flavour.  It tastes just like Thai Tea!!!  They make their own ice cream in that little space at the back.  On top of that, they also have soft serve as well!!  Summer is going to be goooooood!!!  Lol  
I really like the exotic flavours they carry (Hong Kong Milk Tea, Hojicha, Skor, Cookie Monster etc).   Along with Thai Tea, i had the suggested Earl Grey flavour to complement each other.  Mohamed, who was serving me, gave me the idea. He was quite a character with his outgoing and friendly personality.  And oh, he specialized in salesmanship lol."}
{"text":"I'm finding that I like their unique ice cream flavours even more than their Instagram-bait creations.

5 big stars for their houjicha ice cream - I love how solid it is and the level of sweetness is just right, plus it's so, so fragrant. I prefer hard ice creams over soft serve, so this is also why I prefer this ice cream over the houjicha soft cream at Tsujiri. I also really enjoy their earl grey ice cream - this has basically given me a reason to not make the trip up to BakerBots unless I'm really craving their RoCocoa cookie. I used to go up to Bloor just for earl grey ice cream but Fugo is much closer and I love their rendition!"}
{"text":"It was okay. 

I came here with a friend on a Friday night, 30 minutes before it closed. 

We both ordered one ice cream each - which was just too much. I would recommend sharing, unless you were hungry. 

My friend ordered the Bangkok brownie - which is basically Thai milk tea soft serve, two layers of brownies, chocolate drizzle and 2 stick cookie things. My friend said that the Thai milk tea soft serve was good, however the brownie was just too much.. It was also very dry, so he left the bottom layer of brownie untouched.

I ordered the Cookie Monster - which is two scoops of blue food coloured cookie and creme ice cream, around 6 mini chocolate chips and a waffle cone (they ran out of the regular cone). I would like to say that nothing was special about this ice cream... Unless you count having blue lips and tongue something special! The blue lips part took a while to come off, also, ladies, unfortunately, lipstick will not cover the colour... If you would like to try the Cookie Monster, I advise that you use a spoon."}
{"text":"I like the simplicity of this dessert place. I had the Earl grey ice cream with waffle cone.  The flavour was perfectly balanced. Not too sweet and has a noticeable early grey flavour. Will definitely keep coming back for something sweet after dinner.  There are no washrooms available and limited seating/standing space so would not recommend this as a sit down dessert place."}
{"text":"I saw people outside the shop eating blue ice cream with cookies and I had to try it. 

The shop had a chill atmosphere with chalk boards with the menu on it, which was kinda hard to comprehend. ( I ended up ordering the wrong thing) I asked for the cookies and dreams thinking it was the cookie monster one. The flavour was still very good and the decor on the cone and the top were beautiful. The downside was the inside of the cone was completely empty. 

The shop is generally crowded and seating is minimal. I had to eat my ice cream outside, which let it melt. 

Well worth the trip even though the ice cream was $7.99. Fast service and great taste. (Might go back to get the right flavour)"}
