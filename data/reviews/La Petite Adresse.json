{"text":"J'y suis allée aujourd'hui pour dîner et je dois vous avouer que j'avais bien hâte! J'avais vu tellement de belles photos de l'endroit et lu de bonnes critiques sur des blogs que ça faisait un moment que je voulais aller voir par moi-même.

Bien qu'une terrasse soit installée à l'avant du restaurant (au gros soleil...), je me suis installée à l'intérieur. L'endroit était frais sans qu'on ait l'impression d'une climatisation à fond. Le confort quoi!

Le confort est d'autant plus agrémenté par le charme du décor: des murs de briques, des poutres de bois, des tables en lattes de  bois, de petits vases de fleurs sur chaque tables, etc. Rustique et chaleureux.

Une bouteille d'eau a été déposée sur la table et j'ai jeté un coup d'oeil au menu. Des salades, des sandwichs, des trucs simples, mais qui ont tous l'air bons! Personnellement, j'ai opté pour le sandwich de porc effiloché! Je me suis régalée! Souvent, dans ce genre de sandwich, la sauce coule partout, mais là, bien que le goût était présent que la viande n'était pas sèche du tout, on n'avait pas de difficulté à le manger. Le sandwich était accompagné d'une salade de choux que j'ai A-DO-RÉ! 

Petite déception: quand je mets les pieds dans un endroit qualifié de \"café\", je m'attends à trouver des breuvages pour tous les goûts sur le menu autant chauds que froids (surtout l'été!).... Ici, non. Cafés, thé, jus ordinaires et eau.... J'aurais bien aimé un soda, un thé glacé ou une limonade maison, mais bon.

Par contre, quelques vins sont disponibles."}
{"text":"I was so happy to have found this place today! I always love a brunch that is out of the ordinary, where the chef is creative and creates delicious dishes. This place totally delivers! 
I had the stuffed portobello mushroom with poached egg. There were pecans, goat cheese, micro greens, and layers of beets in the mushroom. I was so happy and satisfied with this dish! 
My friend had zucchini pancakes with smoked salmon and a poached egg. He was also impressed. The service was great and very helpful and friendly! 
I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cute little French coffee place. I liked the attention to details especially with the mint tea and orange blossom, brought me back to childhood memories.! 
Try l'ultime grilled cheese with caramelized onions and apples.  While it was not as good as the grilled cheeses at lapin presse, it was good! 
The prices are a little high but you can tell they use quality ingredients. 
Nice atmosphere. Will come back to try other dishes!
That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"French from France. Close to home. Breakfast. I really want(ed) to love this place. 

Unfortunately, the service was super slow. Food was a bit bland, although there were some high points. Coffee was just so so. Trusted friends and spouse report similar experiences. They're pretty new and might just be ironing out the kinks...  

1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Un vrai régal saisonnier ! La cuisine est pleine de saveur et justifie le prix. Les légumes sont savoureux, le service agréable, rapide et avec le sourire ! C'est une petite mais bonne adresse."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été un midi en semaine, et avons gouté le ''beef brisket''. Il est vraiment excellent!
La terrasse est sympa et la Madame qui nous a servi aussi.
Seul petit hic, j'ai trouvé le service un peu long.. mais ça vaut la peine!
A essayer!"}
{"text":"We had the grilled cheese sandwich and eggs merguez and it was delicious. Cosy and friendly place with seating outside right on busy Parc. Service was a bit slow but that can be a good thing. For  breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Super découverte au coeur du Mile End : une bonne adresse pour des plats fait maison à déguster sur la jolie terrasse :-)"}
{"text":"Good food quality but at low cost; win-win situation for us!! We went to La Petite Adresse on a rainy day, which might explain why the restaurant wasn't packed perhaps... On every table, there were fresh flowers in a vase, which added a little touch of freshness and warmth to the restaurant. The menu was in French but the waiter (I think he was the owner) tried to explained everything in English and made recommendations to my friends as well. 

I gave a 4/5 because the service was kind of slow... The owner was the only one cooking, serving, etc. He was basically alone doing everything, which explained the slow service. But, the owner was very welcoming, approachable and helpful!

One of his recommendations was: the Oeuf en cocotte aux tomates & poivrons confits avec merguez ($12). My friend ordered that and he enjoyed it so much that he went have a little chat with the owner! He said the quality of the ingredients exceeds the amount we paid!  

The owner recommended another dish to my other friend: L'ultime Grilled cheese pancetta, fromage suisse, oignons caramélisés, Granny Smith accompagné de salade mesclun ($13). He said this is one of his favorites! I tried a bite and liked it! Their grilled cheese was really good! There were a lot of bacons inside and the bread was so crunchy yet not hard like a rock! It had a different flavors (a little bit of sweetness) because of the Granny Smith. My friend really liked her grilled cheese because it is not something you can get elsewhere!

My other friend ordered the salmon in spices and black pepper with green beans and beurre blanc ($15) I don't remember the name of this dish but if you want to order this, I guess you can show a picture to the owner or tell him it is the salmon dish... I remember the salmon melted in my mouth. It was a pretty good dish but nothing \"special\" if that is what you are looking for. 

I didn't know what to order and I opted for their Sandwichs à l'effiloché de porc confit & salade de choux maison ($11). I normally don't order sandwich in a restaurant because I don't really like to use my hands to eat.. I tried to use a fork and a knife but it was way too hard to eat a sandwich with utensils! Although I don't normally have something for sandwiches but this one was really yummy! There were a lot a lot of meat inside and the bread was once again crunchy but not hard and difficult to eat!"}
{"text":"Très bon brunch. J'ai adoré les pancakes à la courgette, le pain qui semble être fait maison et l'oeuf avec les merguez et poivrons confits. J'ai par contre été déçue par le fait qu'il n'y ait pas de jus frais pressés maison et que le thé à la menthe n'en soit pas véritablement un. On a par contre bien profité de la terasse ensoleillée"}
{"text":"Mon épouse et moi avons brunché 2 fois à la petite adresse.
C'est un bel endroit. Ils offrent des brunchs qui sortent de l'ordinaire.

Nous y sommes allés à chaque fois avec un couple 2 couples d'amis différents (dont un avec un bébé) et ils en sont aussi sortis convaincus !

Une bonne adresse !"}
{"text":"France-French kinda place. Exterior cuteness drew us inside and taught a valuable lesson which is : Cute can deceive. Coffee is awful. I'm sorry, the latte was the worst I've had in Montreal. The brunch menu looked good but given our drinks being so undrinkable, we left. I really wanted to like this spot. That said - Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood brunch spot; family-friendly and also good place for couples or to meet a friend. Efficient service. Menu very straightforward with decent brunch options (I went on a Sunday). The dish my eggs came in was hot but the food itself was not PIPING hot. Also the bread they served alongside the dish could have been a bit softer and more toasted but that is just my personal preference. I would come back and try something else."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for brunch on a sunny Saturday afternoon. My friend got the sweet pancakes that was doused in maple syrup and I got the shakshuka (but they spelled it differently on their menu). 

While my shakshuka was tasty, I felt that my recipe was better. The reason why I gave La Petite Adresse was because of their baguette. Best I had in town so far. They should open their own bakery."}
{"text":"Cute bistro that serves a limited variety of food but everything is very good! Good quality-price and very nice employees. I went for brunch and would go back again!"}
{"text":"Cute brunch place, slightly crowded but great service. Ordered the shakshuka, a slightly spicy tomato egg dish with tons of sausage and served with crispy, soft bread. Slightly too much sauce but the bread soaks it up well. Would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"The place is very cool. Unfortunately the service is so slow and it's very expensive. The food is good but nothing of really special. There are many places that offer the same quality without spend a lot of money like here."}
{"text":"Jai vraiment adore la salade de maquereaux! Le cadre est mignon, le service parfait et les prix sont corrects :)"}
{"text":"Quaint brunch spot! The eggplant dish is really good probably my favorite. You can't really go wrong it's a small cute café one waitress - so be patient - with very good coffee!"}
{"text":"Une très belle place qui offre un petit nombre de place assisse.
Les plats proposaient sortent de l'ordinaire d'un brunch traditionnel.
Le service était bien et je donne le conseil d'effectuer une réservation."}
{"text":"A classy and unassuming little French bistro with a limited but excellent menu. Everything on offer looked tempting. Wonderful food at surprisingly reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Eggs with zucchini pancakes were great. Service was super nice too. Vegetable platter was also great. Fun small place!"}
