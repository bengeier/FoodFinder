{"text":"Just moved to the area, so glad I found this place. The only thing that could be better is if they took credit cards. Awesome family owned place, great friendly service and awesome food. Awesome breakfast, great fish on Fridays, amazing pastries and bread(s). So good we've become regulars on Sunday (and sometimes Saturday) mornings.  Good Things: Pork & Eggs (with the steak or pork) - Awesome. Sausage gravy is great, so are their hashbrowns. Breakfast sandwiches - Holy crap, their croissants are delicious. Seafood Platter - Awesome on a Friday. Honey Fried Chicken - Pretty good, not a Southern fried chicken ( :( ) but still pretty good.  Probably more that is good, but that's what we've gathered so far. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Here's what I love about this place: It has the feel that it has been there for 60 years and the main \"diner\" side has never changed.  I love seeing seniors lined up at the bar eating their breakfast and having their senior breakfast club.   The new owners are hard workers, extremely dedicated to their cafe and the Black Earth community.  They have it going on. I have a variety of their breakfast- traditional American, traditional British and they even have delicious Norwegian Pancakes too.   Biscuits and muffins are scrumptious and even my sister in law from Georgia says the biscuits were to die for. I have only been for breakfast, but they serve lunch and dinner as well.   Family friendly, cash only, absolutely on my list to return over and over again."}
{"text":"Food coma.   I would give it 3 stars except it was my dad's favorite place for breakfast. I took the little dudes here to experience \"Grandpa's breakfast\" and we all ordered the English breakfast. Aka, how many ways can you fry shit. Eggs, sausage, fried bread and \"potato scones\". WTH are potato scones? They're like hash browns made from potato paste. Pure gut bomb.  Their \"fried bread\" is just that. Bread tossed in a pan of hot butter. Holy moly it was good!  Overall, your standard small town diner kinda place. It has a certain charm. Most of the people coming in are locals/friends of the staff. Everyone's friendly. There was a flier up on the door inviting any and all to someone's birthday party. My boys thought it would have been funny to show up. Nuthin' fancy. Not bad."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Luckenbooth Cafe' for breakfast.  It was delicious breakfast comfort food.  I had the smallest order of the biscuit and gravy breakfast.  It had hash browns and cheese underneath the gravy.  Really good.  My friend had the breakfast burrito which she said was delicious.  Nice portion sizes and great prices.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant breakfast at Luckenbooth Cafe, served by a pleasant waitress on a pleasant Sunday morning. The food was pleasant too. It really is the best way to describe this place. Just...pleasant. Nice might work too.  The interior has two sides. One side is labelled \"Yvonne's Tearoom\", which appeared to have nice tables and was decorated in a combination of English country and American country styles with natural colors. The other side (where I sat)  has a soda fountain and is more traditional diner, with tables in the middle and vinyl upholstered booths on the edges. Both rooms are large and there is a good amount of space between the tables too.  The menu was not what you would expect, so look it over and try something new. There is the usual breakfast items you would find, but the menu was studded with some European items that aren't normally on a menu, like toad-in-the-hole. Also, they make two kinds of English sausages in the back. Either can be subbed in for your normal breakfast sausage at no additional charge.  I had Norwegian pancakes, and dressed them with butter, a little powdered sugar and a touch of lemon. They were delightful; tender, but chewy in a way normal and even Swedish pancakes are not. They came with a side of sausage and I chose one of the homemade sausages. It was a link and seasoned with cumin and black pepper among other spices. The portion was generous but I felt they were merely O.K. The links were a little greasy in my opinion and maybe a little under-spiced. I can't really judge as I've never had that kind of sausage before. For all I know, they're exactly what they're supposed to be!  Service was friendly and nice in a sincere way. The coffee was not bad, and the mugs they use are narrow and heavy, so it doesn't get cold so fast. Refills were quick and my food arrived hot. They did a great job.  Luckenbooth gets 3 stars from me. I will be back if I'm in the neighborhood, and I would say give it a shot if you happen to be in their neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Living in Black Earth, and seeing this place change it's name a couple times, I needed to try out the new Lunkenbooth Cafe. It looked pretty much the same inside as the prior Stone Soup Cafe did, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It may not be absolutely greatest interior, but its pretty nice, and it has a good atmosphere. It wasnt sure what to order, but i choose a sandwhich that had to do with some sort of BBQ sauce i think, with bacon and whatnot if i can remember correctly. It was awesome. The secret BBQ sauce on it was out of this world. I loved it. They also have some of the greatest pies I have ever eaten. So stay for some dessert! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had heard about Luckenbooth and decided to check it out for the first time.  Our first impression was of an above average cafe with some very nice extra features. The place is extremely neat and clean and off to the side there is a Tea Room that is quite fancy and very inviting.  They have watercolors on the wall for sale by a local artist and the works are very nice too. The owners were very friendly and laid back which we like. The menu was simple and straight forward which is a big plus in our book.  We really dislike overly detailed menus. Our food was good to very good all the way around but off enough to pull this review down to 4 stars. The bread was delicious (some of the best \"appetizer\" bread we have ever had) but we would have liked some whipped butter with this and had to use butter packets instead. Not a big deal though. We ordered fish which was very good.  (not sure what the economics are for this area but an all you can eat cod dinner for 9-10 dollars would be nice.  We recently had an all you can eat cod dinner for 7 dollars at another location.)  The fish was cooked perfectly and the breading was not greasy and very good. The coleslaw was very good but the vegetable dish was unusual.  It had a good flavor but the carrots were hard and undercooked.  Not sure if this was how it was supposed to be or not. Mashed potatoes excellent. Our dessert was well made and of large proportion."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Super friendly staff, food is good and really cheap.  Just a nice place to stop by.  Today I got a breakfast sandwich and a pancake for $5.75!!"}
{"text":"This is the epitome of small town independent cafe/diner: friendly owners/staff, good food, even better prices! We came on an Aug Sun afternoon prior to a play at APT in Spring Green.  We totally enjoyed our leisurely meal and chat with the owners.  Do try the homemade cream puffs for only $2 - rival the Wisc State Fair's!! Most of their dinners are under $15 and their lunches and breakfasts much less.  Our party of 4 was totally satisfied with each of their meals.  Very good value."}
{"text":"Okay, I am a fan of Luckenbooth. I was going to write this purely as part of my series on the reuben, but alas I cannot. I can't write a word about Luckenbooth without mentioning the wonderful people that own and operate this café.   How often do you go to grab a late breakfast and wind up talking with the owner of the establishment for hours. How often are you honestly moved by a restaurateur's dedication to their community? That's what I've experienced each time I've been to Luckenbooth Café. Yvonne and Cliff are always available for a kind word and often a leisurely conversation.   And the food... it's great. Do yourself a favor and try their homemade sausage. It's the best. And the pancakes are outstanding.  Okay, so here's the reuben portion of my review. Yet again that the sandwich was made with a light rye bread. Is this a trend, or some aspect of reuben history of which I'm unaware? The corned beef was fantastic. I'm told that Luckenbooth gets its meat from the butcher across the street, Heiney's. Instead of the traditional stack of thinly sliced meat, you're presented with hearty slabs of tender deliciousness.   The mark of a great reuben is that the sauerkraut doesn't overshadow the corned beef, and you don't have to hose the grease off your hands after eating. Cliff seems to have nailed the mark here. The sauerkraut, cheese and dressing served only as accompaniment and accent, and my single napkin served more than sufficient.  I've been told that their pastries are also amazing. This is my first priority next time I visit Black Earth."}
