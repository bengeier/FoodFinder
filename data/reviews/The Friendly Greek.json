{"text":"Good food, wasn't expensive at all, restaurant isabsolutely empty all the time so not sure about food freshness, liked it though so will be back."}
{"text":"The Friendly Greek's food and service have impressed me the times I've visited. I'm no expert, but the food I've had here seems to be on par with some of the better Greek offerings in Toronto. 

It would probably only rank 3.5 stars (if that was an option) but it gets  bonus points for being one of the few places in the Yonge & Shepperd area that has good tasting, high quality food that is reasonably priced. It beats out Springrolls and all of the pubs I've sampled in the area.

They have a large menu and several vegetarian options, about 4-5 entrees (not just a veggie souvlaki folks). I really enjoy the vegetarian moussaka which seems quite difficult at other Greek spots in the city. The Saganaki (flaming cheese appetizer) is also quite tasty. 

They have a couple choices of beer on tap and the casual service was quite attentive and friendly without being overwhelming or stifling. The owner seemed to recognize my girflriend and I after just a couple visits, which I always enjoy."}
{"text":"Good food.  Tsatiki is mediocre.  Restaurant floor and tables were sticky.  Good service though.  Price is a bit high."}
{"text":"They don't seem to wash their dishes, as all the plates come out dirty. I asked for paper plates and cutlery. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"The Friendly Greek is the best breakfast spot in the Yonge and Sheppard area. The food's decent, if a litlte pricey for breakfast (the area really needs a pure breakfast restaurant, like a Cora's). But it's a clean restaurant and the staff are really accommodating, even putting Treehouse on the TV for my two-year-old instead of golf for a few of the regulars. (I think the owner realized the value of keeping the two-year-old quiet if he wanted to keep the regulars.) Parking is really handy at the back of the restaurant. The patio isn't of much use as it faces Yonge Street, which is like a highway in this part of the city and is really loud."}
{"text":"I like to stop by and pick up garlic bread, yes thats right just garlic bread. I like their garlic bread with cheese, its very cheesy and goes good with either something I decide to make or something else that I pick up to go with it. I have tried dishes here as well they are fine. Your average Greek food  (:"}
{"text":"I keep finding coupons for this place since the restaurant reopened as Taste of Greek and they gave us more to come back. We always have the gyro plate as its super yummy. 

Service is really great but i seem to have bad luck with their fountain diet coke. 

Yesterday it was more busy. Recommend going and checking it out again."}
{"text":"As someone who eats Greek Food quite regularly I would strongly recommend anyone who loves their Greek Food to stay away from this place. I venture a guess that this restaurant is not owned by a Greek Family. For today's review, let's go with the bullet point format:

Negatives:

- Greek Salad is simply green lettuce with Feta Cheese sprinkled on it (Kidding right? - Nope!)

- No Pita bread, but seemed like sausage buns that were tunred into a type of Garlic Bread (WTF, right?)

- Lemon Potatoes seemed like they were cooked in Campbell's Vegetable Soup and had an orange colored sauce on them (Really, Campbell's?)

- Meat was of a lower quality and smaller size chunks - beef was heavily spiced which is never a good sign when eating meat. 

Overall The Friendly Greek is anything but on your stomach and tastebuds. Definitely skip over this one if you are in the Yonge/Sheppard area as there are plenty of great restaurants in this area to eat at."}
