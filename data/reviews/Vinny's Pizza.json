{"text":"Had the gyro. It is made from a patty   it was over cooked. I  mentioned that to the waitress,  she said \"well, most of our customers love it \""}
{"text":"Not at all your typical local pizza shop.  The menu has great variety, to include some dishes normally only seen at much fancier restaurants, but all of which can be enjoyed here in casual dress and atmosphere.  Very friendly owners and wait staff.  For anyone who's ever been to the Monterey peninsula, this is the \"Schnarley's\" of Middlefield."}
{"text":"Vinny's is the Absolute BEST in Authentic Italian Cuisine in the  Burton/Middlefield OH Area!  I have never been dissatisfied with anything I have ordered there!  It ALL was Incredibly Good! Blaze knows how to keep it Real &  Delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Vinny's in Bainbridge/Aurora.  My wife and I ordered the  Wedding Soup.  Unfortunately, we did not enjoy it very much.  Not seasoned enough and had a greasy feel to it on my tongue.  Not good, however, we ordered a meatball pizza. A large 16\" pizza cut into 8 slices. Not 8 little slices, but 8 huge slices.  This was one of the best pizzas we have eaten.  The pizza was loaded with delicious meatball, which were seasoned perfectly.  Not too heavy on the tomato sauce and just the right amount of cheese.  Crust was cooked to perfection with the right amount of crunch.  Looking forward to trying many of the other choices on this extensive but moderately priced menu."}
{"text":"Went on the spur of the moment for dinner.  The food and service were both outstanding!  They make an amazing marinara sauce that is beneath their fried mozarella.  If it was bottled, it would be in my pantry.  I had the lasagna which was meat laden and although it was the lunch portion, I had enough for lunch the next day.  My husband had eggplant parm which he raved about, and again brought home enough for a second meal.  Hot garlic rolls were too good to pass up.  The side salad was so-so, but very fresh.  Heck...even their coffee was great!  We will absolutely go there again...and again!  Great value!"}
{"text":"We placed our order through grub hub tonight It said an hour to be delivered which is understandable since it is Xmas. After 1 1/2 hours I call and the guy said it's in its way. After 2 hours I call no answer. I tried again no answer. I call back on my other ph# the same guy who answered before says my order was canceled. I said we'll you told me it was on its way. He says he ddnt have capacity to make the order. At this point I'm very upset. Don't take orders if you can't follow through with them. And they had our # they never tried to contact us. Terrible customer service. Never again  they do not even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"I got the chicken wrap from there which was good. Also got the spinach pizza which was very \"Generic\".   The one thing that threw me off was  the service from the delivery guy. Very rude when he was calling my cell for directions for our company on West Liberty Ave. Not sure if I would order from there again."}
{"text":"I just got a pepperoni pizza it was not very good I will not be coming back. The sauce tasted like a jar that you would buy in a supermarket and the crust was soft. I was disappointed with it. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Vinnys is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The new look and location is great and the new chef is taking things to the next level. I have not had a bad dish yet. The staff is super friendly. On my last visit I have the chicken masala and it was awesome. So much flavor! It was one of those dishes that the first bite just makes you go \"mmmmm\". If your in the area and want some fantastic Italian food stop in to Vinny's."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. Family style portions, so tons of food. Very small. Order water, the pop is bar quality, pretty gross. Pretty quick service."}
{"text":"I don't normally review places, but this place was by the the worst I've ever ordered from. We ordered the Buffalo chicken rolls (and requested ranch) and a Supreme Italian hoagie. I was charged an additional 80 cents for the ranch I had requested but it didn't come with our food. The Buffalo chicken rolls were raw in the center (filled with uncooked dough) and the \"Supreme\" Italian hoagie was some Oscar Meyer processed lunch meat slices on some bread, along with 2 small pepperoni slices and a few small pieces of diced sausage (and it was cold). Seriously? We had a few bites before throwing it all away - and I am by no means a picky eater. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"it was late when I got home and one of my favorite pizza joints was open only for pick-up (wah-wah, they were out of delivery guys). So I blindly picked a new-to-me pizza place to  order from. Beggers can't be choosers, after all.  This place took average to a whole new average.  The first star it earned was for being on time, the second was for getting the order correct, and the third was for everything being piping hot.  I ordered some of my favorite items that I normally get at other places, and for each one, I kept wishing I was eating the other place's food.  First up were Vinny's pepperoni rolls. They were...fine. A little too doughy with not enough cheese or meat, and a bit dry because of that. My favorite pepperoni rolls are from Vocelli's, which are rich and gooey and absolutely perfect. These were not that.  Second I had wings, which I was really worried about because I've had terrible wings from some places. The wings were probably the best part of the meal, because they were not drenched in Frank's Red Hot, but had a light sauce on them and were very crispy. They still weren't the best, and they were just satisfactory.   The third things I got was an Italian wedgie, and this was probably the worst part of my meal. I've never seen a wedgie that looks like this, and I thought it was pretty bland. It was just a big thick piece of dough with very poor quality lunch meat inside. Seriously there were pieces falling out that I am sure were bologna. I love the wedgies at Nobby's, and wished I was eating that instead.  Yup, just average and I won't be back to try them again."}
{"text":"this is one of 3 pizza joints along brookline blvd but it's not American-owned.  they're middle eastern people who hardly speak english .  i admire their work and any immigrant/migrants working hard to make it here but the pizza is mediocre and i waited 70 minutes for a pizza delivery, a short while ago .  any of the surrounding area pizza joints would've gotten the pizza to my house in 40 minutes or less, for sure. i could've walked to Fiori's and picked up a pie or 3 in less time...  the driver showed up and could barely communicate in English .  I won't be giving this place any more of my business.   they need to work out the kinks and perhaps hire an American English-speaking manager..."}
{"text":"Got a large pepperoni pizza and it barely had any pepperoni on it. $2.19 extra just to throw on a few pieces here and there. The pizza was a little doughy like it wasn't cooked all the way. The guy that delivered it was a little rude. Not getting my business again. There's better pizza joints around."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I never had their pizza, only pastas.   Vinny's pastas are delicious. And I highly recommend the spinach feta cheese rolls. They're great."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Vinnys for a few years now, a few months ago we had a not so great experience and stopped for a while. Last night I decided to order again. I ordered on line with Eat Street. Not happy to say the least but I will give them the benefit of at least trying to make things right. Our order was completely wrong.we ordered the pizza, wings and hoagie deal (which states whole hoagie and we received 1/2) we also ordered a baked penne with meatballs...we received partially cooked penne with very little sauce and 1 tiny meatball. We also ordered a chicken Tuscan pasta which was smothered in oil, had no red peppers or artichokes in it...and both ended up in the garbage can. We asked for ranch with our wings and greek dressing with salads, we got neither. The pizza was barely fair...frozen would have been better. We also ordered oreo cheesecake since it was valentines day....we got chocolate cake which no one wanted or liked. 60.00 in the garbage can.  Well, I can't recoup my money but i hope someone else learns from our experience. Sorry Vinnys...we won't be spending money with you again.  Oh and update...i just called Vinnys, was told by the nasty woman who answered the phone that they don't have a manager and she didnt work last night so its not her problem and she shouldn't have to relay a complaint.  Lovely! Please save your money....don't waste it at Vinnys."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday for a slice of pizza.  On the way to my lunch I noticed a sign in their window that they had slices for $1.99 and since I am always on a quest to find the best pizza in Pittsburgh, I figured I would stop by afterwards.  The inside of this place isn't much too look at as there is a small area with a counter in front of it and then the kitchen.  Whenever we got into the restaurant I asked for a slice of pizza.  Less than 2 minutes later I was walking out with the slice inside of a box.  Upon making it to my car I took the time to examine the pizza.  The first thing that I noticed was the glassy looking cheese on it which didn't bode too well.  Then immediately after that I realized how small it was.  I could probably get a slice 3-4 times as large for a buck in Manhattan.  Overall the taste of this somewhat cold pizza matched the look of it.  The cheese and sauce weren't that great and the crust was super dry.  I probably would have done better buying a frozen pizza and making that instead.  The bottom line for me is that I wouldn't head back here again in the future.  It's tough to feel ripped off by a $2 slice of pizza but Vinny's somehow did that for me with both the size and taste."}
{"text":"YUM. Hot Italian cold cut is awesome. Don't make the mistake of ordering a full for one person, it is HUGE! Lasted me 4 meals! The wings are also really good, with lots of meat. Can't wait to go back! UPDATE: Went back and got the meatball sub & pizza. Both are awesome. Vinny's quickly became our favorite pizza/sub place!"}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit, and get go Middlefield twice a year. I would give this place 6 stars if I could. In Detroit, they could easily charge twice the price  and still have a line out the door. Just great!   Decor:  Looks like they bought a shut down drive thru fast food restaurant and made it nice inside. All oak furniture, large booths, looks like they are building a patio.   Service: Our server was super perky and friendly, but just ok.  Interaction in kitchen shows the staff really cares. Cook was helping server in very constructive manner.  Just had great feeling overall.   Food: Off the charts!    Antipasti salad BEST I ever had. Wife says same thing. Presentation best I ever saw. Flavor best I ever had.  Dressing - better than my balsamic. Half order is HUGE. Enough for 4. I will copy presentation.   We ordered the calzone. Large is big enough to feed 4 large, hungry teenage boys. Wish our server told us a small is large enough for 2 to share.  Flavor: delicious!  Toppings are unique and thoughtful. Dough is superb.  Words escape me to describe how good this is.    I will be in Middlefield next week.  Will come here to try other items.   This is a great place."}
{"text":"Got pasta and sauce. Garlic bread was good. The pasta and sauce was a bit flavorless. The meatball was alright. Sausage was boiled. Cool bar setting and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the new place their gluten free pasta is so good. I loved the Chicken Marsala !"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money ordering from this place they are rude and they do not get your order right. I will never order from this garbage place ever again they do not know what the hell they're doing nor how to run a business."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and a cute little place for the family. Everyone here is always very nice and polite. And they don't laugh at me when I only order dessert. The only thing they could improve on is having more dessert on hand, more often than not they are out. Maybe a little less salt on the eggplant parm :)  Love this place. Would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place makes the best pizza in my neighborhood. I have never been disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"On Saturday March 16 ordered a pizza for delivery. Waited an hour and a half. Called 3 times, they kept saying it was on the way.  When it finally arrived it was ice cold. Called to complain. They said no worries, they'd give me a credit. Called today for pizza, said they never said that.  Go figure!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service ever. Was charged $26 for food that I never received. Called the store after 1.5 hours and was told that my food was on its way. Called back 30 minutes later and was told my food was cancelled through Grubhub then was hung up on. Apparently the manager had just left.  After reading reviews i see a trend of terrible customer service. Would NEVER recommend giving this place business."}
{"text":"CATCH-UP TIME!   Oh Darren's just mad because he misses his Krazy Brothers. lol Their pizza and hoagie were pretty good to me when we ordered from them.  Delivery was lightning quick as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the Burton Ohio/Middlefield Area   There used to be a restaurant here by the same name, it closed and it is now re-opened and I hope it stays the food is fantastic. It is  down home, Italian food, the pizza, the pasta and the most of the chef's themselves area all from Little Italy.    The portion sizes here are generous and well priced the offer everything from pizza to pasta and delicious sandwiches. They Lasagna I just wanted to write for a bit about it. This is something that you have to try,t he portion sizes are amazing, layers upon layer of noodles, homemade on the spot ricotta cheese, stuffed with veal, sausage and hamburger meat. Topped with fresh grated cheese, and a healthy portion of homemade tomato sauce. THIS is the real deal folks, something that keeps making me go back for more.   This most recent incarnation of the restaurant is going strong, the offer catering, and delivery. The pizzas are always hot and fresh.  A favorite is the White Pizza is  topped with Italian Ham , spinach, tomatoes and an amazing white sauce that has good hints of garlic and  topped with roma tomatos and fresh cheese.   I can't keep singing the praises of this place, just stop by and taste for yourself why it is going to be a hit in a town that desperately needs a new place to eat."}
{"text":"Delivery was super quick! I ordered a hoagie and soup and it arrived at my house in Baldwin in about 20 minutes. I ordered because they were the only pizza place that had chicken noodle soup, which I was craving. The hoagie and soup were good. I'll order a pizza next time to give it a try!"}
{"text":"So we recently moved to Brookline and this place is just up the road. Having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... After two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza \"well done\" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. Sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back.."}
{"text":"I must say first, very quick and friendly service.  The problem with this pizza joint, is the pizza.  It was a thicker dough stingy amount of sauce and the small amount of cheese was burnt making it a hard plastic layer that covered the pizza.  I wish I could keep supporting them but just a lousy product."}
{"text":"We've been here before and really liked it. This is the first time we've ordered from there since they changed location. I was disappointed. We ordered a margherita pizza. They advertise fresh mozzarella cheese as a topping. The only cheese on the pizza when we got it home was a few shakes of Romano or Parmesan cheese. That pizza was too expensive to not come with cheese. The cheese pizza we ordered was very greasy. The wings were pretty good and the cheesy breadsticks weren't bad either. For the two pizzas (1med and 1 small) along with the bread sticks and ten wings was 45 bucks. Too expensive for such a disappointment."}
{"text":"In a sneaky move, Vinny's purchased the phone number of the superior Krazy Brothers, which is now no longer in business. I didn't find this out until a few hours ago. I called the number for Krazy Brothers only to get Vinny's. The telling, tragic tidbit was disclosed to me by a Vinny's courier.   Unfortunately, I found their pizza and hoagie to be as middle-of-the-road as I did the last time I tried them out. If you closed your eyes, you'd think you were eating food from a national chain, and when you taste something and think of chains, you''re in...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPI6HcLv39Y  Missing DeMino's and Krazy Brothers terribly, this is Darren W. signing off."}
{"text":"Used GrubHub to order from Vinnys. They offered a coupon for free breadsticks if you spend $20, awesome right? well, food gets here..and no breadsticks. okay, stuff happens. I call Vinnys and tell them the mishap thinking it was just a mistake. to my surprise i get told, \"if you wanted breadsticks, you should have ordered on my website. my coupon, not grubhubs\" and then got hung up on. grade A service....NOT! good luck with your future endeavors mr.vinny!"}
