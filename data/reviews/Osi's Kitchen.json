{"text":"I ordered lunch for 5 people, to be delivered at 11 am. My rating is based on the quality of the food (mediocre), the price (too high given the quality of the food), and the lateness of the delivery (almost 30 minutes).

The food was lacking flavor. The fries were soft and under cooked. The falafel was bland. One person ordered some kind of chicken salad - it looked like hot chicken soup on a bed of lettuce. The portion sizes were small. $75 for 5 people is fine is the food was better, but this seemed more like mall food. Finally, I told the person who took the order that I would prefer they were early rather than late (we were on a tight schedule). I never got a call saying they would be late. I had to call. I never received an apology. I would have preferred to have been told that they couldn't make it by 11. It was a serious inconvenience.  I can't imagine giving them another shot.

Bummer because they are close to work and they deliver."}
{"text":"A very special find my son found on Yelp. We we definitely go again. the food was fantastic. We had the special of the day Osi's Kitchen Grilled Mix for two."}
{"text":"The food is Amazing. The service is impeccable. 
The Shakshuka Merguez is the best breakfast.
Osis Kitchen brings all the best of Tel Aviv
To Vegas. This is my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Came straightaway from New York, after I heard so much about Osi's Kitchen in Vegas!
It felt like home! Osi is the owner, she's like a mother to her clients, she's blessed!!
Food was awesome, prices are very reasonable and specially the service and how they treat to their clients - like it's a big Israeli house for everyone.

Thank you Osi, and specially the staff
See you SOON !!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restaurant in Las vegas, clean, delicious, kosher, comfortable! Nothing else to say, coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!!! Food was amazing! You taste the goodness in the home made food. Best kosher restaurant in Vegas!!!!!! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the schnitzel baguette and my daughter that falafel pita. We will be back."}
{"text":"great place! I'm so glad I found it... I had rice with stuffed zucchini and meat balls, it was delicious and even though I ate there by myself the food was enough even for two people.
The place is nice and clean and you feel like eating at home.
definitely going back for some fricassee next time, the traditional tunisian sandwich i bet it's really good."}
{"text":"Hearty and delicious! You can taste the love in the food! Merguez lamb and cous cous dishes are both good ways to go. The meatballs were so so but overall tasty. Service was super quick and friendly. Verdict: Osi's stands out among other kosher restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I come here when I'm in need of quality ingredients and a home style cooked meal. Literally some of the best fresh baked bread I've ever had and the service is always great :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Osi for amazing food homie fresh 
You have the best team. 
I'm in love with your meatballs and couscous w vegetable stew 
And also I recommend for the hummus w eggplant omg delicious. 
And the best part was that I make order with bite squad and everything come so fresh thank you 
The best mediterranean food in vegas:))))"}
{"text":"This was a great find! Delicious food, super friendly, home cooking-style and authentic. It's like a place you'd find in Tel Aviv (and having lived in the Middle East I know what I'm talking about.)."}
{"text":"Wow...luckily I ran into this place. I was curious when I came across it. The food is amazing !!
Everyone is nice and helpful. It has that tasty exotic flavor in it's choices . Glad I experienced it and going there again today it's that good. It truly is as good as it gets!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous gem of an eatery! Such good food and friendly people! Perfect portions and a warm inviting establishment. If I came to Las Vegas more often, I would eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were small for $10 each. 

Delivery took nearly 2 hours. 

Delivery driver entered through employee area behind cash register. 

But most importantly the order was wrong. I attached a pic showing special requests but those requests weren't honored. Received a sandwich that was ordered without onion or tomato. Opened it and looked and didn't see any so I started eating. ..

On my 3rd bite, which was halfway through this tiny expensive sandwich, my windpipe started swelling. Anaphylaxis. 

So ...

$10 for a tiny sandwich that took two hours to get wrong. 

$40 for the Epi pen I had to use. 

$500 for the ambulance ride. 

$500 for the ER copay

Fear for your life ... Priceless. 

Anyone with allergies needs to steer clear of this place. Don't risk your life for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly service! We came here on a Monday night for dinner and were so happy we did. We had the 3 salad sampler, hummus, special chicken and falafels. Everything was delicious. The Falafels were amazing! Not dry and no bread crumb fillers. The waitress explained they are mixed up and cooked as they are ordered - you can tell! The hummus was superb and salads were great. Don't leave without a cookie - they are amazing! We will be back for sure. Also the have sandwiches that I can't wait to try for lunch! As if that all wasn't enough, the service was great. WAY above and beyond. This is a new neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"I traveled to Las Vegas to visit my family. I observe laws of kashrut. First, we went to Osi's Kitchen to get challahs, salads, and pastries for Shabbat. Everything was delicious and reminded me homemade food. The next time we went there for dinner. We ordered burgers, falafel, and hummus. This was the juiciest burger I have ever had and the fries were amazing!
Falafel was competing for the first place as well. Everything was delicious, freshly cooked from scratch!
It was a great experience - homemade food away from home. The decor is tasteful and very uplifting. Wonderful ambiance and service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food tastes delicious, service is really great! The. Location is close to the strip and locals."}
{"text":"First of all I want to preface this review by mentioning that I'm a professional chef who has worked for some of the best chefs in the city (Alain Ducasse, Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon among others). 
I ordered delivery early in the afternoon upon the recommendation of an Algerian fellah I was with. 
The food arrived after about 45 minutes (not too bad considering the veritable feast me and my \"friend\" had ordered). The food arrived lukewarm to slightly cold, except for the mint tea which was hot. This didn't matter at all!!! The food was that good! Highly recommended and can't wait to eat at the restaurant itself. If you wish to hear me get all \"chefy\" and ramble on about the individual dishes read on. If not, drop what your doing now and go eat at osi's.
The merguez plate I got with couscous and pita. The merguez (four links) was tender and spicy with a nice snap and pleasant lamby flavor. It was garnished with lightly charred onions, which added a counterbalance of sweetness and savoriness to the mildly assertive sausage. 
The cous cous was fabulous. Even though the online order form says it's \"Israeli\" couscous it was in fact the more common semolina variety common to North African cuisine. It was topped with an unexpected stew of carrot, acorn squash, potato and zucchini. Flavorful and delicious. From a text book perspective the veg was over cooked and very soft but I truly appreciate the flavors and textures of braised and stewed vegetables. So for me it was beautiful, especially paired with the NOT over cooked and properly steamed and seasoned couscous. 
The side of pita came with two very large, fluffy and soft flatbreads with the smallest hint of char on the exterior. Superb. If they are not made in house then they are from an excellent supplier. Not your average sad side of pita
We also ordered the falafel and hummus plate. The hummus was smooth and creamy with a texture that was not too thin or too thick. The flavor was in perfect balance between the nuttiness and earthiness of the tahini, the sharpness of the lemon, the piquancy of the garlic and the richness of the olive oil. Not one overtaking the other leaving the dominant flavor of chickpeas intact.  
The falafel was not great though. It was truly amazing. I have probably eaten falafel in nearly every middle eatern/med restaurant across the valley (no joke). Even though it was cold it was still crispy with an amazingly creamy interior. None of that starchy and dry texture that can often be true of mediocre falafel. The flavor was bright with herbs and spices but still not dominate over the flavor of chickpea
Also shared the platter of homemade \"salads\"
Babaganoush was smoky and very good (not the best in town but still delicious)
The carrot salad was fantastic. Carrots were sweet and had a slight crunch and very redolent of aromatic spices like cumin and coriander and high quality olive oil
Beet salad was filled with properly cooked red beets (not too soft or undercooked), herbs and lightly crunchy onion. Good balance of sweetness and acidity 
The vegetable \"cole slaw\" (not sure of the proper name) was fresh and crunchy but did need a little more acid  
The true gem of the salads was the matbucha. A thick chunky purée of stewed tomato, peppers, garlic and spice. Addictive. Just plain addictive. The combination of the matbucha, couscous and acorn squash (in the couscous) was one of the best bites of food ive had in a while
Finally the mint tea. It came hot and full of fresh mint. It was subtle yet flavorful and complimented the whole meal. 
Thanks fellow yelpers for hanging in their while I wax poetic on one of my new favorite restaurants in town. Seriously go eat there. NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"This looks like a family restaurant, off Strip, comvenient location, easy to reach. They are open also on special holidays but closed on Sundays. They have everything home-made with love :) We ordered vegetable soup, which was quite fine and with different veggies(like carrots, potato, zucchini), and also omelette. Omelette was a bit burned. Also it was with onion, that I dont like, but neither I did ask the ingredients nor they told me. Quite, not crowded and good for breakfast and lunch, but if you're really hungry, you should order big plates or portions. Also, hummus and small salad were complimentery."}
{"text":"If i could give this restaurant 6 stars, i definitely would! 
One of my favorite & regular hotspots in Vegas! Thats for sure!!"}
{"text":"This Israeli Restaurant is so good! very authentic Israeli food. The crew is nice and friendly. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice food good service and nice catering
I choose the shakshoka , and I eat salad with that shakshoka ,and also nice meat stow .:)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Amazing food! Fresh and homemade flavors!! Best schwarma!!!!! Feels like home."}
{"text":"Thought give this local place a try. Do not order the shawarma at $11 with no side it ain't worth the money, also totally lacking in flavor and the service was not friendly what a shame no reason to go back , no iced coffee nor iced tea very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok I am just going to put this out here. I do not like this place. 1000% bland. 

They carry ZERO dairy here, that alone gets a star. Thank you!

My in-laws were in town with their Kosher male friend and demanded we check this place out. They loved it. Me and hubs....not so much.

The place had 1-2 other customers the hour or two we were there. 

Meza was ordered for the table, it was all very good. The tomato item tasted a little old and \"off\" though. 

I ordered the veggie cous cous stew stuff and hubs ordered the falafel pita. Not even sure if these items were totally vegan, we asked and just really got the run around.

Soooooo the falafel pita had a weird taste. We (and especially my first gen American hubby) have had lots of falafel....from everywhere. It was just bland and odd. The pita bread itself my in-laws assure \"was traditional!!!!!\" ok it tasted fine.

The guy waiting on us was nice, but super slow and stood on his phone in the corner 90% of the time. We had to shout him over. He wears a lot of fancy perfume. 

I ordered iced tea, it was a mason jar? with a Lipton bag and some ice and mint inside it. Whatever I'm not looking for anything fancy.

Sooooooo...I really wanted to like my cous cous veggie stew. It was bland, not super hot/warm and just kinda meh. Even a sprig of green on the top would have been nice. I have no clue if it had veggie broth or lord forbid some kind of animal products in it.

Anyway. One star for zero dairy and another star for a nice server guy.

As locals, hubs and I will skip this place.......and continue to patron Amena."}
{"text":"Nice homey restaurant . Doesn't taste like commercialized food, just nice and Good fresh homemade food. Owner came out to say Hi, The actual decor has a nice bright feel to it."}
{"text":"The best israeli food! Every time I'm in Vegas I go there and order the same dish:) beef kabab with hummus and pita. The service there is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place! I was there on Tuesday, had the couscous. It came with lots of sides and was a huge meal and even including the tip it came out to just around $20! It tasted just like the authentic couscous in Morocco."}
{"text":"Last night we wanted a little Mediterranean food but would not pick a place.  We found Osi's kitchen on yelp.  This place is fantastic.  The decoration is cute and unique with the picture frames on the walls. The owners are very nice and pleasant.  They helped us picked out what we wanted to eat.  Everything tasted wonderful and we were happy when we left.  We ordered the hummus, fricassee, and shawarma.  The food was delish even the water with the mint and lemon in it.  The hummus plate came with warm pita bread and was very tasty.  The fricassee was enjoyable with the fried bread which was filled with tuna.  The shawarma was warm and nicely flavored.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly Yelp was 100% correct in recommending this restaurant. I walked in and I was immediately taken back six months when I was in Tel-Aviv with my wife. The smells, the décor, the people!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place . They make you feel right at home. Food is seriously like moms food. Meat was delicious and Eyal our server was so nice and friendly . Best kosher spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious Middle eastern, North African food! Don't need to be Jew to come here and enjoy the food :) ! I'm Muslim myself and it reminded me my sweet Moroccan home! We had the meat balls, couscous, pargiot, shakshouka with merguez! Everything was very delicious! Special mention to the meat ball and shakshouka!
Also we were there for Hanukkah and we had free beignets :D !"}
{"text":"Wow. Beautiful, delicate flavors. Everything was so fresh, and the falafels were hot, light, and crunchy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Feels like you are eating in your Grandma's kitchen. Delicious. Friendly. Unique. And of course you are forced to keep eating! So many great dishes and appetizers.  
I don't write many reviews but this place is new and should be discovered and supported. Go now!"}
{"text":"Amazing wow !!! Love supporting local Bushinesses especially when the owner takes so much pride sandwich was great"}
{"text":"Amazing awesome food. Great shawarma and meat balls. Very tasty. Like Israel. Very clean. Great staff. Very hospitable. Good prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Here in Vegas for work, searched for BEST Mediterranean food and this place came up. It was THE BEST ever. The food was amazing, service was amazing, and the restaurant had a cute family-homey feel. I reccommend this place for anyone searching for good food and good service!"}
{"text":"I visit Vegas with my family I find this amazing place the service is great the place is super clean and nice and the food is amazing highly recommended"}
{"text":"We are very happy to have been introduced to Osi's Kitchen by a friend of ours.  The food is very flavorful, beautifully prepared and presented, and the staff is as friendly as can be.  The focus here is Moroccan/Israeli food.  Our party of three enjoyed the k'tsitsot (meatballs) with rice, the sabich, and the chicken schnitzel.  They served housemade pickles and a warm chickpea appetizer, as well as a sample of their house salad.  The warm chickpeas on the cold salad was awesome.  The prices are fair, and we appreciate that fountain drinks (served in charming handled canning jars) are included in the entree price.  The decor is very country home style, and the restaurant is impeccably clean and well maintained.  I'm very much looking forward to trying more of the menu in future visits.  The Tunisian server was very friendly and engaging with a huge smile.  Osi herself came out to say hello.  The guy workers were very handsome.  Everyone seemed happy to be there and serving customers.  They gave us a little sweet housemade sesame cookie to finish the meal, which was the perfect capstone on their really great hospitality.  My only suggestion is that the food could use more salt, but the Moroccan flavors were perfect otherwise."}
{"text":"Sweet service, clean kitchen, tasty food. Glad this spot finally opened up, menu offers some great dishes that aren't found too many other places. I like that they have a daily special, as well as one of my favorite dishes, shakshuka. 

Tried the schnitzel sandwich and was surprised to see it served on a French baguette roll instead of the more traditional pita or laffa, but the bread ended up making the sandwich: crisp on the outside, fluffy inside, and super-fresh. Schnitzel was thin and crispy, sandwich condiments were a touch peppery for me. Sandwich served with some house-pickled vegetables, which was a nice touch.

Heads up that they're closed Saturdays for Sabbath. I'm used to kosher spots in Vegas having ridiculous prices, but the ones here are reasonable: $12 for sandwich above, and it was massive, delicious, and fresh."}
{"text":"Luckily I found this kosher place after searching for a meat resterant, I was not expecting such good food! I ordered couscous with vegetables and roast beef. 
It was so amazing! Real couscous made from scratch and I was very impressed, highly recommended!
The roast beef was worm and taste like home made, which it not obvious at every restaurant! 
The service was amazing! Definitely will visit again.

Thank you Eyal for serving us you are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is best Kosher food in Vegas if you are looking for satisfying kosher food in the Vegas area this is the place. They can even deliver the food straight to your hotel with no issues it's great food hot and fresh when it arrives. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Wow. Just amazing! Some of the best food ever! My girlfriend and I ate here and I had the falafel pita and she had the shwarma. Both were amazing. The pita was so delicious and fresh, everything was flavorful and moist and so well done. They use excellent quality ingredients and really take care in preparing their food. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best kosher food in Vegas hands down! Really home made cooking and plenty of options. We also ordered Friday night dinner to our hotel which WA a success. Everything came warm enough to eat and packed well. No spills"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in looking for a different type of food and chose the lunch entree \"merguez\" that included spicy lamb sausage and choice of two entrees: either fries, salad, rice or couscous with vegetables. My fiancé chose the couscous with veggies. We were thrown off because the couscous with veggies was already considered to be two sides.. we thought no big deal. I chose shawarma sandwich on a baguette roll. The waiter took our orders including two waters we asked for. We thought we would get our waters right away, but after 15 minutes of waiting, we reminded the waiter of our water. 
When the food came, we were a bit disappointed with the merguez entree. My fiancé got 4 pieces of lamb sausage that was thinner than the  sausage links you get from mcdo. It was sad because his sides were bigger than his main entree. I don't know if that's the usual portion of Mediterranean foods but we didn't think it was worth the $18 we paid for. Also, my fiancé noticed a piece of hair hanging from the side of the plate. He didn't make it a big deal since it wasn't IN his food. 
Aside from that, my $13 shawarma sandwich was good but not bangin. 
We probably wouldn't come to this place again."}
{"text":"Omggggg I was there last week, we were in our Las Vegas trip, we are living in NY and we eat only kosher food. It is number 1 in USA!! The service was amazing, very personal 5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Actually good.  But the prices were not 'value' and the attitude of the owners was almost 'snotty.'

\"This is the best Vegas has to offer\" but it is not.
The storefront is okay.  But just okay.
And the attitude of the staff was not okay.  
And the kosher supervisor (masgiah) was too busy to speak to me.  Not good."}
{"text":"First time here and everything was great including service. Our waiter Eley was knowledgeable and friendly and answered many questions for us as it was our first time here.   
   We ordered chicken schnitzel with a potatoes and my gf ordered the meatballs with rice. Side dishes included Israeli cabbage salad, hamutzim(pickled vegetables), and homemade babaganush. Our dinners also included homemade pita bread which was fantastic.
   In conclusion, everything was homemade and delicious. It reminded a bit of my mother's cooking many years ago. I will look forward to dinner at Osi's again in the very near future."}
{"text":"Very cozy restaurant, extremely clean and staff was very friendly.  Owner came and introduced her self which felt more personal. Food was amazing! Highly recommend.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice people, cute atmosphere, clean, with delicious food. Veggie options too. B'tayavon."}
{"text":"From 12/2/15 

I needed a falafel-fix so I went into Osi's for lunch! First, let me just say this place is really nice, I love the way it's set up, decorated, and the system they use looks hi-tech!

I placed my order; it was ready in a reasonable amount of time, and the lady who rang me up was friendly!

My falafel was delicious! I got it on a pita, there is an option to have it on a Baggett, perhaps I'll try that next time I come here to grub"}
{"text":"If you really wanna enjoy Israeli - Moroccan authentic meal that's the place to be . 
Great Taste good service you getting the taste of Isarel !!
Kosher . Clean . Yummy"}
{"text":"Tried to place an order here and couldn't contact the place. YELP called to advise that they've closed down."}
{"text":"I really liked OSls Kitchen... The food was very tasty and the service was very kind and professional, I will be back here and recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"When im going to osis kitchen i feel like im home!fresh tasty and hommy... My fevorit dish is the shnitzel and the couscous w vegetable"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat! Very clean, friendly staff and yummy kosher food! The rostbeef is amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with my associate one day.  We had the chicken special of the day,
couscous and salad.  The staff was very attentive and informative.  The food was expertly spiced and it seemed like the food had been prepared with love or at least pride. The price was reasonable especially considering the quality of the overall package.  It is on the other side of town for me or I would visit more often."}
{"text":"Delicious! This spot is situated in a small strip mall. The decorations inside are lovely and the ambiance was perfect for a date night or family meal out. We loved the Shawarma pita sandwich, and hope to try new dishes next time. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place after my parents bought us a groupon certificate. The food is terrific,  highly recommend the kabob with herbs, Israeli salad , lamb sausage , and falafel. The decor , music and ambience are great;  especially like the casual modern decor.  Service is very warm and friendly and staff treats you like family.  If you are searching for high quality kosher Mediterranean cuisine - moderately priced , then check this place out. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This was good for a first visit. Had never tried schnitzel before. The fries came with the combo, and a Fanta - orange mmmmm (remember the commercial Fanta Fanta Fanta).

Loved the pickled veggies. I think I ate all the olives and carrots. Just FYI if we're eating this kinda food together and you don't like olives or carrots, lemme know ;)

Cozy atmosphere small diner, pleasant service and speaks English well. Very helpful in explaining dishes so I can choose. Pricing is what would be expected in the area. 

Would entertain dining here again for sure. But it may be a while as there are many places I'd love to try with this cuisine. And it's one of the best things to have here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been there since they opened and it's about time to write what I think about the place.. So it is clear as possible that the food is number 1 in Vegas, love the staff , Osi really knows how to treat the costumers and they treated my friend really good.. Highly recommended.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The Pargiot Salad is top of the chart and all the side dishes are incredible. Falafel and Pita top notch. If you need a quiet and classy Kosher get-a-way in Las Vegas, this is your destination."}
{"text":"Love this place ! All the food is tasty and authentic ! Fast service and great atmosphere . I will definately come back!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  The place gives off a homey feel and you get the feeling of a home cooked meal.  The hummus - outstanding.  The pita - delicious and fresh.  The meals themselves varied among Mediterranean regions and Africa, all offering unique tastes.  The meals were a little expensive at about $15, but the quality is of a high end restaurant.  They have take out and variety and are Kosher on top if that's your thing.  Both the shawarma and the meguez were good, though the latter was fairly small for a main dish.  The sides were just okay in my opinion.  All in all, definitely worth a visit if in the area."}
{"text":"Best falafel in town! Ayel was our server and he was very helpful with the menu. The cous cous stew was nice. Sababa!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The service was impeccable. Kudos to everyone that gave outstanding service!! It's a small family owned business and I think the mom is the chef. I ordered the meatballs and my bf got the Merguez. We also ordered the hummus and it was delicious. Everything was delicious and the Marguez has a kick to it. I liked it. The meatballs were delicious as well. It comes with salad and rice or potatoes. We both got the rice, but I might try the potatoes next time. It's regular rice, not pilaf or anything like that. Can't wait to come back and try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place! I got the three meet plater! This chicken and the beef kabab were my favorite on the platter. And the bread they give you with there hummus tahini is exceptionally great!! I'm coming here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great people. Great food. Love the array of salads. They even took our picture to put on their Facebook page."}
{"text":"I am very dissatisfied with this restaurant. I am constantly eating Mediterranean food, at least 3 times a week. Today, I decided to go out of the norm restaurant that delivers to me(maza) and try this place out.. Prices were very high, but I thought that's ok, good food is normally pricey. I only ordered 2 items,Falafel Plate and chicken shawarma plate, it came out to 36 and change. The woman on the phone said it would be \"around 30 dollars\" umm, around???
50 minutes later, with a $5 delivery charge BTW- The delivery guy calls me and says, \"I think I'm here, do you want to come outside or...\"    or what? Come to the door? Seriously? I had to walk out twice since I never got a money total.
We are starving at this point, we open our food.... Soggy fries, cold falafels, and flavorless hummus and salad. Not a pickle or pepper to compliment even a bite. I've never eaten such bland Mediterranean food. Oh! And the portion size? Small. For 35 bucks I could have ordered a variety of dips, HOT food for two, 6+pitas, and dessert! Taken leftovers home even!
Sad to say that this is the worst I've eaten in town."}
{"text":"Holy flavor! The best hummas I have ever had, creamy and fresh. Great breaded chicken, amazing potatoes and the meatballs were outstanding. Very quick and polite service and atmosphere was great. People hanging out, chatting after food is long gone. Cozy, warm feeling, wouldn't have guessed it by the strip mall. Overall amazing....."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. The only place in Vegas where you can find Authentic Moroccan and Tunisian food"}
{"text":"I got the fricasse for lunchtime take out today- it was good! I see they do free delivery on orders over 30, so I may take advantage of that in the future!"}
{"text":"Second time now and what can I say my friends,,OMG
So delicious it's truly an amazing experience!!
I called in at around 8pm just finished work and asked about the specials.  Was told the couscous, beef and meat balls were recommended and yes they are!! 
Thank you for an awesome dinner you've really made my day!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean food!!! Great and fast service !! Got to try the merguez sandwich!"}
{"text":"I honestly could not say enough good things about this place .. It's very welcoming, the homey decor makes you so feel comfortable to start with. Every day there's all kinds of authentic dishes, and every single day is a different special. I am Tunisian so of course I'm in love with it all BUT the MERGUEZ sandwich and THE FRICASSÉ are definitely specialty for Osi's kitchen, you can't find either one anywhere else in Las Vegas. Sarcastically funny though, at first I didn't want to try the Fricassé because I didn't want to get disappointed (my grandma's Fricassé made it hard for me to like anyone else's Fricassé) but I tell you one thing, I was very surprised in such a good way, everything from the stuffing tasted fresh and the dough was uniquely light and tasty .. Also the Couscous (North African dish) is authentic home made with the veggies stew... Literally irresistible.. All plates come as a pretty big portions, and very reasonable prices.. Highly recommend trying this place if you like home made authentic North African cuisine, considering that this is really THE ONLY place that has it."}
{"text":"Not our first time and definitely not the last, we love the fact that they have a special of the day every day. Today we had the roasted beef special which was amazinggg!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We tried this place again.  The falafel was really great.  The bread is very fresh.  The staff was friendlier the second time we went there.  No complaints.  Worth another star."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean I have ever try in the area. 
Small and quite with great service so I recommend this place to anyone that want to try something different with a lot of spices and flavor."}
{"text":"This type of cuisine is really hard to find. Israeli, Morrocan and European all in one place. Osi's is super clean and thats a plus. Note that its Kosher but you don't need to be Kosher to enjoy the food. They bring you a delicious little bowl of pickled vegetables on the house. Next I had an Israeli salad that was fresh and tasty. I picked the Sabich sandwich for lunch because its very common in Israel but rare in the USA. Its a velvety mixture of smoky grilled eggplant, a soft egg, salad and hummus in the most wonderful pita I've ever had(rival to Shaya's pita bread in New Orleans), the sandwich is unique and superb. The prices aren't bad at all. One complaint is that the place was empty but my food took over 25 minutes to come out, thats tough at lunch hour. Great place though."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Israeli comfort food place on this side of the Atlantic. I recommend ordering the Mazza plates for two and either the merguez or the pargiyot- both are cooked and spiced to perfection. I did not have the pleasure of having some of the other items, but I imagine that they are also amazing. The service was exemplary, the waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, and our food arrived promptly. I plan on visiting this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"Very authentic and tasty! Just a bit pricey, but that comes from being a small business. I got the hummus and a few of their small salads and all were great! Will definitely be back to dine in."}
{"text":"Ordered the hummus and falafel plate.  Was virtually identical to what one would typically receive in Israel.  The falafel was excellent and was freshly made for my order.  Nothing is worse than places that make falafel once or twice a day and keep them under heat lamps.  I enjoyed the hummus, but to be honest, I prefer a thicker consistency.  The pita bread was in the top three of any I have ever received.  Friendly staff and a clean environment."}
{"text":"Reason I'm giving one star is because i got sick when i got home. the service was very fast but the problem was that the chicken look like fish, couscous didnt taste right either.   It is alot of money per plate i wouldve prefered a lil more meat and not so tough when eating it.   (Secret spices i didnt taste)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on a work trip and ended up eating lunch here 3 days in a row. The food is delicious - good authentic Israeli food, great staff and customer service, and delicious flavors. Felt like I was eating food in  Israel :) Make sure to get the matbucha (spicy tomato dip). Great for pick up or dining in."}
{"text":"From the moment I arrived to Las Vegas , I eating twice a week at \"Osi Kitchen\", the best Food at all Vegas!! exactly like home! The service is A+, the environment,Convenience,Hospitality, the best kosher meet ever! If I could give them 7 stars I will.. thank u Osi for every time that u make me and my friend feel like home"}
{"text":"The space inside is kind of small and can get a little hectic once they get busy. Primarily because they let people seat themselves. A single person was sitting at a table for 6 etc. You can see into the kitchen from where we sat and it looked very clean. The server was super friendly. It seems like a family owned establishment with a homey vibe.

The service was nothing special but you could see that they were making everything fresh which was great. We ordered the Osi's Kitchen Grill Mix for a couple. It came with two sides so we got the french fries and the salad. The salad was delicious and very fresh. The kabob and pargiot were delicious. Never having tried Israeli food we were happily surprised with what was brought to us. Definitely worth the 40 dollars we left stuffed."}
{"text":"I was eating a plate of roasted beef with mushrooms and mushed potatoes with very good salad and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, clean and fresh every time ...!
Must try ....close to strip...what else can you ask for :)"}
{"text":"I'm not too familiar with Mediterranean food, but everything I've tried from here was delicious. They don't seem busy at all during lunch, so if you're coming with a group at this time, you should be fine. The interior is very trendy and clean and almost has a coffee shop vibe to it. My food always came out so fresh. Also, be prepared to pay for a pricey lunch!

Kind of weird, but my part of 3 asked the server for more water and he brought back just one cup. Where's the pitcher at?"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!

I was on vacations with my wife and we were looking for kosher authentic food when a local guy directed me to Osi's kitchen.! This was the best Israeli food I've ate abroad!! The appetizers were delicious and the meat from the grill was seasoned perfectly just like home. Our server was knowledgeable and polite and recommended us just what we liked! I would highly recommend this place for anyone with a taste for Mediterranean food.

Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed in the inside. The people here are incredibly sweet!!! The food was very very fresh and tasty! It's a wonderful environment."}
{"text":"I have a hard time finding good Israeli food where I live, so when I travel, I like to seek it out. Osi's Kitchen had good reviews, and I had time on a Thursday evening, so I decided to give it a try. 

The restaurant is easy to find, located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. It's small on the inside, and although it wasn't busy when I arrived, it was pretty full by the time I left. The waiter brought me some olives and pickled veggies to munch on while I mulled over the menu...first sign I was in a quality establishment. I was torn between a few menu items, so I asked the waiter for his suggestion, and he pointed me toward the pargiot sandwich on a baguette. He knows his stuff. The meat was moist and flavorful, the baguette was perfectly toasty, and it tasted just like the sandwiches I got with my dad when we traveled to Israel when I was a kid. 

I raved about it to all of my Israeli colleagues, so hopefully I can bring him some more business. If you're looking for an authentic, delicious, satisfying meal, this is your place. Just don't go on the Sabbath. I'd recommend going as a group so you can try all of the salads because that's the best part."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh Mediterranean food 
Feeling like home  you will get a warm welcoming and the food is to die for"}
{"text":"Wow.  ..so good Always goo there for couscous  is my favorite,  but it's the first time I order delivery  and YES !! they do deliver  I was a bit concern because normally when I make delivery from any restaurant  it's not  the same like dinning  in.  But the rider came quickly  and perfectly  I was 100 precent  happy has the couscous  with meet and it's came delicious  and warm also my friend order they freshly  baked baget  with saksuka  and came amazing.  Wow again I will definitely  order again"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Ordered the falafel pita . Amazing. Their hummus is so fluffy and flavorful, way more depth of flavor than usual. Pita is perfect, cloud-like. Also tried their veggie stew; delicious. I think they must have a cult kosher following with a large to-go business. Huge group of Israelis entered when I was there, and at least 4 people were waiting for to-go orders. Try this place!"}
{"text":"OMG this is an amazing find the food is amazing!! This is definitely my new favorite lunch place!!! You must try it!"}
{"text":"I have no clue where to start, 5 stars across the board!!! just to start off everything is kosher and super healthy, you can taste the homemade in everything we ate!!!! when you walk in you feel like youre transported to a traditional israel restaurant super comforting. we started off with the orginal humus unbelievably creamy  and flavorful, the pita that came with the humus was warm and flakey, you can definitely tell they made that from scratch youre not going to get bread like that from frozen bread! My friend recommended me to get the meatballs and rice and i DEFINITELY recommend you to get that too!!! the meatball just melts into your mouth!!! how much flavor there was in one meatball was kind of unbelievable/unexplainable but its was the best ive had in my entire life.. sorry mom! but when you combine the rice and the meatballs on your fork i felt like that one part in the disney ratatouille movie when he tried the strawberries and chocolate together and he felt like he was in a dream that was actually me when i tried the meatball and rice!!! i was shook when i ate this meal and i couldnt stop myself, this place is super underated!!! blew me out of the water highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in town by far. 
We ordered 4 pita with schnitzel.  
Unbelievable delicious. So fresh and yummy 
Thank you osi great service."}
{"text":"Had a rather simple lunch of hummus & falafel, very good, and service was beyond friendly, but the true delight was the soup of the day, sweet potato. I could live on it, it was so delicious. 10 out of ten."}
{"text":"I was very happy with this restaurant. I ordered the Moroccan meatball dish. While it was good, I really liked some of the side dishes, like babbaganoush. They also gave us a free side of eggplant. I wanted to use a groupon but one of the items ordered was a grill item and the voucher states you cannot order grill items using the coupon. Our server was so nice and apologetic anyway and gave my daughter a free tea and desert!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Chicken Shawarma is unbelievably Delicious! I'll definitely be a repeat offender and come back.  I highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"The Israeli Salad is FABULOUS. INCREBLQE FRESH SEASONING HERBS oh this is a score. A quiet spot...for now until I send my friends.  Best HUMMUS in town. I've been to them all. Just a rich better than Jerusalem Grill and Amanii
Great menu 
They have breakfast. 
They cater 
I don't know if I want to share but I'm going to. 
Soooooo delicious. My new home."}
{"text":"This is my favorite kosher restaurant in Las Vegas! I have ate here at least ten times in the last year. I've liked whatever I got each time. Sometimes we hav ordered holidays meals and it's amazing! Everything is so good this place is real home cooking, comfort food at its best! The lamb meatballs are my favorite but honestly I love everything here!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food for parents and kids.  We came here mid roadtrip and it was perfect.  The kids split the schnitzel entree, H had the chicken schwarma, and I had falafel and the house salad.  It reminded us of our favorite Lebanese restaurant in Hermosa Beach.  Everyone was very happy with their meal and the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"I loved the small charm of this place , the Sabich sandwich was amazing and brought me back to the time I was in Israel . I'm going back for the Moroccan fish"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at this place isn't busier... The food was actually amazing. The falafel's were moist. The chicken was very tender. Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"We LOVE Osi's.  We come here every time we are in town.  The falafel, meat balls, hummus are off the charts fresh and delicious.  They also have the traditional pickled vegetables on the table.  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.  If you love Mediterranean, try Osi."}
{"text":"A small, nice restaurant with amazing food, great atmosphere and a great staff. I got the ground beef with eggplant and a side of rice, so much flavor, it was delicious!!!! I finished my whole plate and I left the restaurant with a full stomach.... Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Very expensive for poor food and service, went with my parents that came to visit from Israel, we ordered pargit that came with only one side to choose from, rice or salad..,we choose rice that was good, the pargit was just ok. Very small hummus, 1 pita bread & fries cost us $65.   
Service - There were tables for 2 only, and when I point out that to the waiter he suggested that we will combine 2 table together  (by ourselves) when I told my mom not to do that because they need to arrange that, he complain: \"I don't know what happened today, everyone coming today with demands\" and add: \"What comes out - you should be satisfied\".  I don't think that restaurant like that should charge service fee in the bill, since there was No service there. they should let the customers decided if they want to leave tip and how much."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service, it's a home made food in every bite, we enjoyed it very much, can't wait for next visit"}
{"text":"At 11:05 am I walked into the restaurant.   The chairs were still on top of the tables and a young gentleman was sitting playing what I assume would be a game on his phone.  I asked,  \"Are you open?\" He lazily looked at the clock above his head and replied,  \"ah, yeah but the cook hasn't arrive yet.\"  

I stood there for a moment hoping my entrance would spark him to maybe offer me a drink and put the chairs down.  No such luck.  I slowly turned, made my way to the door (hoping he'd say something to keep me there), and left.

I'm not sure if I'll go back.  After owning a restaurant for many years, I would question the freshness of the food at this restaurant.  Food freshness comes from preparing the food BEFORE you open."}
{"text":"Authentic Moroccan food reminded me of my mother's cooking. Absolutely fresh and delicious and highly recommend everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Great food! The staff is friendly, the establishment is clean and quaint. The food was delicious and so cheap! I will come back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great host. Will definitely come back here. I would recommend them giving faster better service. Though. Otherwise the food was great"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with this restaurant.
I bought Groupon to try their food and I went to eat, I ordered 2 baguette sandwiches  (for me and my friend), it was less than mediocre and bad value for money IMHO.

When we ask for the bill, we presented the Groupon and the waitress told us \"Groupon is not valid for baguette\" - are you kidding me??? I came to this place just because of this deal, to try your restaurant ... I was in shock, I asked to talk with the manager, the waitress told me that he will talk with him. When he came back, he said the manager can't do nothing for me and I need to pay them.

I felt like I was **scammed**, I felt embarrassed for the owner, how come you have a new client that you need and want to impress and the outcome is bad review + I will tell anyone I know my bad experience?

I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE !!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been on a quest for the best shakshuka in Vegas ... and I think we've found it! Just the right amount of spicy and served with warm homemade bread - It was PERFECT! The service was great! I regret not asking our server's name - he was kind, personable and attentive. We loved the energy of the place and all the positive signs of love and family hung on the walls. We will be coming back for more shakshuka and to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"If you are in vegas and want kosher food for about $15 per person including drink... Big portions... THIS IS THE PLACE.... Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"I love her food! As an Israeli - the most authentic food you can find around here! The design is as a modern home, and the food is so good, you cannot go wrong. These guys know what they are doing... Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"verey good and personal service. the food is great and very delicious.. we order meat balls in baget and it was good. I'm very recommend on this kosher restaurant in vegas.. good pleace to eat! we felt like at home! good job!"}
{"text":"They did not have the fricasse that it says they have on this app just to let anyone know. I did not eat here but went there for fricasse and they told me they don't have that."}
{"text":"Nice and quaint little place that's got more of a personal touch in the atmosphere. They make everything and the quality and taste are good. I can't compare it to other similar cuisines since I don't eat it often and I likely won't visit again anytime soon. It's just not the kind of food I'm used to."}
{"text":"I'd can't really review this business because on 2 random occasions I order food through Yelp eats and it turned out the restaurant was closed. Closure did not correspond to posted hours. I'd love to try Osi's but I can't"}
{"text":"Great place really wonderful food but the main thing that was definitely more than five stars is the service.
Eyal was so nice and pleasant to us he definitely made a big difference with his great energy and highly coustomer service!
Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Almost skipped Osi's after reading a Yelp review mentioning that they close at 7:30 p.m.  That's an ungodly hour for this night owl to eat dinner.  Happily I noticed on the Yelp page that their hours were until 9, and after calling to verify, we were on our way.

This small storefront is simply decorated, but comfortable and clean.  A friendly welcome and excellent service followed.  There is no alcohol served, and you can bring wine, but it must be Kosher wine.  Most liquor stores these days have a good selection of Kosher wines, but the bright and casual atmosphere at Osi's isn't that kind of place.  

A number of the menu entrees are available as platters or sandwiches.  I ordered the Merguez sausage entree.  All entrees come with a small Israeli salad and a choice of potatoes or rice.  I didn't want either of those, so the waiter suggested couscous.  Hubby had that, too, along with  Schnitzel.  We didn't expect the couscous to arrive in large bowls covered with a carrot and vegetable stew on top, each a portion larger than what you'd get from preparing a box of Near East for a family of four!

I enjoyed the Merguez, since it was a new taste for me - spicy but not fiery, and covered with some fried onions.  I don't know if I'd order it again, since some of the other non-familiar items on the menu were also appealing.  My husband's schnitzel was good, too.  

There seems to be a bit of a price disconnect between the entrees and the sandwiches.  Our platters were $14.98 for a substantial amount of food.  The same items in a baguette sandwich would be only $2 less, and come with no sides.  I really would have preferred the sandwich, because (wo)man can live by bread alone, even with nothing inside, but I couldn't justify it.  And I'll get to relive the couscous experience tomorrow, from the styrofoam \"gift box\" I took home.

Oh, and for you who live by Yelp and don't have an unlimited data plan, they have wifi!

Osi's is a welcome addition to the growing Kosher restaurant presence in Vegas, and one that will appeal to the non-Kosher among us."}
