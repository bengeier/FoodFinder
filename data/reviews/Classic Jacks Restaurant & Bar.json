{"text":"Classic Jack's Restaurant & Bar has a great location, that's for sure. Located along the Red Mile, a little removed from all the hustle and bustle being on the opposite side of the street. In other words, it's a fine fallback option if you can't get a table at, say, Melrose. 
That's what got me in there. It's nice inside, the service was great, and they had Stella on special. All good things. 
The food was a letdown, though. I had a turkey club, which was fine minus the undercooked bacon. The sandwich came with a choice of two sides. For people that like random, bizarre side dishes, Classic Jack's has what you crave. Edamame, brown rice, mashed potatoes & gravy, etc. My lady got the chicken souvlaki wrap, regretting the order in the first place, and then again when it arrived. Nasty chicken - way overcooked. For her two sides she had undercooked yam fries and linguine marinara. She couldn't eat it all, so as we were leaving she asked to have the pasta boxed up. At least that was the plan, but it never made its way back to our table. The waitress probably did us a favour. However, service was always with a smile, so I can't fault her at all. 
Next time, I think I'm just gonna stick with the Stella."}
{"text":"We used to really enjoy going to classic jacks, getting a wrap or sandwich, along with 2 sides for only $12 is a good deal. Over the last 7 months however they have been going to shit with their service, quality, and management. For those of us not interested in staring at ass while we eat, the service there sucks. I could care less how the server looked/dressed as long as it wasn't slutty or dirty, however, it seems they hire based on what they can get to look decent in a black mini skirt. The service is awful, some of the managers SUCK. I have found a bug in my food before, along with items not made properly on several occasions. We only went back sometimes because we lived right next to it, now I wouldn't dare spend my money there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, service is always good. Beef Dip, simple sandwich but done to pefection here, try it out and 2 sides :) love the fact you get 2 sides. Always a desination Sunday Funday. Cheers Classic Jacks"}
{"text":"likely wouldn't have tried here without a groupon as we live and work no where near but did try it a couple of times and really liked it. It's a bit run down but service is super pleasant and upbeat and the food is plentiful and good. Only had burgers but they are huge, lots of side selection, certainly couldn't leave here hungry."}
{"text":"I also do not get this place. It's a sports bar, but they swankified it. Ok, so maybe it's a gastro pub? 

The menu has usual bar food, nothing at all unique. The nachos were loaded but when your jalapenos are from the can and I'm paying $15.... ugh.

This place has a beverage agreement with, yes, Molson, which fully strips this place of any credibility to argue against my review. Hell, I don't have to write a review on a crappy bar, all I have to do is say \"yep, they're locked into a product agreement with molson\". 

The servers are also your bouncy earls type. They shake your hands introducing themselves. It's not just phony, it's really fucking awkward. This place is full of UFC types in ties. I hate our food and beverage scene in Calgary ever so much and this place just epitomizes it."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like just another franchise bar... actually it looks like that from the inside as well but Classic Jacks is family owned and the difference is in the food; its pub food but its actually good pub food. Plus they have a pretty decent selection of beer. They sometimes have a DJ spinning but they are never good enough to plan your night around them. If you're looking for a meal and a beer to start your 17th Avenue pub crawl then there are worse places to go then Classic Jacks."}
{"text":"I typically go to Classic Jacks for their 25 cent wing night which moved from Wednesdays to Thursdays. Their food is excellent for a pub with nice sized portions and well priced.

Flatbread Pizza's, pasta, burgers, and even some Indian dishes make up most of the menu.

Great place to watch sports or listen to a DJ on weekends in a casual atmosphere Central location on 17th Ave. It is a more happening place than other venues downtown midweek."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I wanted to have a night on the town and after bar-hopping a bit we wound up on 17th Avenue. We were walking by Classic Jacks and it seemed like everyone was having a riot inside, so we had to see what all the fuss was about.

Can I just say that we should have just skipped the meat-market bar hopping and just stayed at Classic Jacks all night long! It was AWESOME!

The people were fun, the waitresses were great, but most of all, the music was AMAAAZING! I'm talking Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Def Leopard, Metallica, Bryan Adams, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Pepeprs, Guns N' Roses and naturally, ALL the classics.

Gawd, it was like an all-night rock party! Haven't had that much fun since the 80s ;)"}
{"text":"Went recently on a Wednesday night. The dip (not sure which one but it had marinara in it) was delicious - the waitress added extra pita bread - we were hungry but not starving for a full on meal so late. 

What was annoying was the live music. I love music and can always appreciate great music -- but this place had a horrible sound system - it was just TOO loud and overbearing."}
{"text":"Good prices, ok beer selection and specials ($6 Stella Sunday's), and lots of food options. What other bar can you order a Paninni with a side of fries, coconut rice, and fettucini alfredo!

This place is decent and they are open late 7 days a week with food service till almost close."}
{"text":"Just renovated to be a little more upscale. Decent food and a great wing night."}
{"text":"3 STAR. The atmosphere is loud, young and happen'n. There is a TV in sight from most any seat. The service is Earl-type tight-fitting black-mini, like it or not. The food was pretty good. The nachos servings are large, the chips are awesome, the sour cream and guac is good sized and the cheese is super skimpy. The ravioli was very tasty. The pita, coconut rice and alfredo was awesome. The drinks are good with 4.25 specials on some days. Oh, and dress in layers when you go to this place. The ceiling vents pump out cold air - chilly.  I might go back just to people watch. 4 STARS - not really possible. It is what it is. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Classic Jacks has become a jewel of my pub dining experiences as of late.  The service, food and selection are great and I've yet to have a bad dining experience.
One of my favourite meals at this particular pub is the California chicken.  Chicken, swiss, bacon, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato and cranberry aioli on a baguette.  I always get it with mashed potatoes as theirs are awesome and make me want to worship Idaho farmers.
They also have my favourite beer that is very difficult to find (Fuller's ESB straight from London) for a very reasonable price.
I've come to really enjoy this place and try to stop in every so often for a good bite and great beer."}
{"text":"I always feel a little guilty for cringing when someone suggests we go to Classic Jack's. It's the kind of place I like more in principle than in execution. It has a nice, classy interior. I love the relatively comfortable chairs. It's busy, and it is all young professionals in their 20s to 30s, looking pretty and hanging out with their friends. 

But the music! It is SO loud. I don't think I have extra sensitive-hearing, but I feel like I should be able to have a conversation with the person sitting two seats down from me. It isn't a club, so don't turn it up like it's one! The mix is usually pretty fun - a little rock, a little pop, a journey through the decades. But I don't just want to sit and groove...

Wings are decent, drink specials are ok, this was the place where I first tried Bud Light with Lime. I don't yet know if that's a good or bad thing. It's not bad, it has pieces of good, but overall it is not my go-to on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday lunch this place is a pretty safe bet.

Why? Pretzel bun burgers. For cheap. Well, cheap-ish. Not cheap if you've got 4 kids back home with hungry mouths to feed, and not McDonald's cheap (though eating here is an estimated 1,000x less likely to give you violent, explosive diarrhea than the aforementioned fast food chain).

I come here to meet up with friends from the core. The nice thing is there's usually some reasonable parking in the community behind the restaurant. The waitresses were obviously not hired for their brainpower (and I mean that in the least misogynistic way possible), but the girls here have always done a pretty good job of getting me what I wanted within a reasonable time period.


I've also had the souvlaki here. Not recommended for dates (unless they've got a thing for dudes with onion and tzatziki breath), but delicious nonetheless. 

Yam fries range from awesome to a bit soggy - use caution. To determine if yours will be YAY or NAY, take a quick walk by the kitchen. If the chefs look angry, tired or overwhelmed, skip out on the yam fries and go for a salad - you've just dodged a soggy orange bullet.

The prices here on days that do not begin with \"Wednes\" are pretty high, but that's par the course for this area of the city (more or less). 

Oh, and the chick who sings here on Wednesday nights is a phenomenal talent. She should be in classy jazz lounges and the jubilee - but I'll appreciate the fact that she's here while she still is."}
{"text":"I went there for a meet-up yesterday and was really impressed! They said they were just launching their new menu, so I don't know what it was like before but it was sure great. Many of the options looked yummy, but they had burgers on special and I heard they were good, so I ordered a Clapton with a side of sweet potato fries. Delicious! 

Lots of high points to the night, including:
-Got seated right away with access to free wifi when I asked for it
-ALL staff were quick to serve, had good timing on refills and were really friendly without ever being annoying
-Burger was fantastic. Perfect portion sizing, lots of options for sides and unique enough to be more interesting flavours than the average burger. The veggie burger looked tempting.
-Good selection of beers and a favourite of mine was on special. I hear they have some microbrews.
-Decent price. I ordered all the specials but still, a night of dinner and a few pints for around $30 was perfect.

They only lose one star because the last time I was there, the service really sucked and I want to see if the stellar service has become the norm. Also, they only take cash or credit (no debit). 

I WILL be going back...Jack!"}
{"text":"Classic Jacks I have fallen for you. Why you may ask? You fed me 25¢ chicken wings, you entertained me with tennis showing on your numerous screens, your shiny metal and leather décor entices me like a magpie to silver, and most of all you employ waitresses that incorporate great customer service with wearing slutty, ass, boob and thigh parading outfits that will bring a smile to every males face.

The food is ok, the beers are cold and there are semi naked ladies. Cool!"}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on my experience there tonight, even though I've been there many times before.  Wednesday's have some great deals and it was the reason we went there.

Jack's Burgers are damn good, but I don't love paying $14 for them when I can go to the Ship and get a good burger for $7.  But, they come on a pretzel bun.  This is a game changer.  I love pretzels.  Pretzel buns elevate a good burger into a great burger.  This is a great burger.  On Wednesday's, you can get a great burger and a side for $8.  Hellooooo?

Tonight's order:
Euro burger (not sure what makes it so euro, it wasn't better dressed than the other burger, it didn't have a man bag, and it wasn't full of attitude, just goodness)
Louisiana burger (bit of spice and some guac, other goodies too)
4 glasses of wine (half price wine on Wednesdays too)

Total: $33.45

Normally, I can't stand how everyone that works there just wants to introduce themselves to you AND asks for your name in return.  But on Wednesday's I'll put up with the fact that someone read a management book on how first name introductions lead to more sales, or some kooky theory like that, because I can get a great burger and 2 glasses of wine for under $17.

{"text":"Over the years, Classic Jack's has become one of my favourite 17th locations.  Now with its newly renovated interior and updated menu, Classic Jack's is better than ever.  That's not to say it wasn't super awesome before but now it's even better!

Every time I go to Classic Jack's I always feel extremely comfortable.  The service there is amazing and I've never been disappointed when I left.  I used to go to Classic Jacks before hitting the bar for the night, but now I enjoy going there to close the night.  It's a great place to spend a couple of hours and not drain your wallet.  

The specials at this place are pretty sweet!  Every night of the week they have some drink on special for under $5.  Sunday's are my favourite because you can get buckets of Kokanee for $17... that's $4.25 per beer.  I also love Wednesday's because it's wing night, and who doesn't love wing night?

Classic Jack's always has been, and always will be, up at the top of my Red Mile restaurant and bar choices.  It's a great place for dinner and drinks.  Everything, and everyone in the place is great!"}
{"text":"Some place are bad. Others are cheap. Classic Jacks is... trashy.

Many places are trying to make it up dressing the waitresses in a \"provocative\" way. But in Jacks I was witnessing how one of them was enjoying an old dude grabbing her butt and telling her something very funny right in the ear. She was smiling and happy - what a nice job...

I don't think you may expect a free lap dance there, but the atmosphere was way too dirty - even for a cheap bar. And Jacks was not even cheap for what they sell. Keeping in mind that there was not much to choose from in the menu, it was simply a useless place to go.

If you have just reached a legal age and feel like getting drunk with a bunch of friends throwing silly jokes on those cute servers - Jacks may be your place. Otherwise - methinks not."}
