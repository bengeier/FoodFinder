{"text":"Hi and, Good Evening or Good Weekend to all!!.  I worked briefly for Sofia and, still wait to get paid what I am owed. Other than that it is a nice place, the staff and, waiters were great-I cannot say enough about the staff-polite to a fault, but also I really appreciated their kindness even though I was only there 1 shift.  I ask that you all kindly accept my recipe for Pasta sauce and, enjoy it-better than Martha Stewart's as I told one female whom I will not name as I choose to be professional about this.  Thanks again for all you did for me.  J.P."}
{"text":"Awful experience. My friends and I were looking forward to trying this new spot for so long but it turned out to be one disappointment after another. It took 95 minutes for any food to arrive at our table. The apps were okay but not impressive for the price or the hype. Of the six entrees at our table, only one was good (the cavatelli). The chicken was so rubbery that we had Rj send it back and when he did, the server offered to bring out ONE plate of spaghetti to replace the two pastas, and suggested the rest of us just share our food. Very strange. (He was kind but that was an odd suggestion). The description of the spaghetti on the menu did not mention it being spicy and the server didn't mention that it would set your mouth on fire.  The bill took an additional 40 minutes to arrive. We arrived at 8 and left at midnight. Beautiful ambiance but not enough to make us overlook everything else that went down. Will not return."}
{"text":"Super nice place, almost looks like a country club of sorts. It was fancy, but not intimidating. Cocktails were great, had a couple of vodka martinis, but they have an expansive list of options."}
{"text":"It is difficult to know where to begin.  Upon entering you see a lovely bar area that has nuted lighting and is of moderate size.  The dining area, on the other hand, is large, brightly lit witout any attempt to make the space more intimate.  The thought of ED's Warehouse from the 1980's came to mind.  The noise level was ear splitting as there was an \"alleged\" piano player \"pounding\" the keys and emitting sounds that claimined to be singing. To call her bad would be to elevate her quality.  There was an audible cheer when she left the stage.  The food.  There are about a dozen appitizers and we selected the stuffed zuccini flowers to share.  It was sufficient to whet ones appetite but at $24 was far overpriced.  There were 5 meat entrees, 2 priced in the 30's and 3 in the 75 dollar range.  I selected the veal which was done perfectly but at $38 was comperable to a $28 dollar meal at other restaurants.  My wife had a lobster pasta.  She asked the waiter to ensure that there was no shell on the lobster.  Thee dish that came was small and not only was there no shell on the lobster there was virtually no lobster. At best 30 grams.  Service was impeccable but the person who brought the food could not know that he brought an appetizer portion of the pasta when a full size was ordered.  Of course, we did not know that they had made that mistake until we saw other diners with larger plates of pasta.  The response of the manager was that he would look into it tomorrow.  That is not the right answer.  At the end you have found that you have spent $120 on food for 2 entrees, 1 starter and 1 side.  Any other fine dining place would have prioced this at about $80.  In the result, food was fairly good but there is no warmth to the room and the overall experience was just one of \"it was there\" and why would we go back.  There are too many other places with better food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Charles Khabouth's latest $9M addition, Sofia Yorkville is casual, yet refined Italian. The menu is almost perfect under Christine Mast, with an excellent selection of Carne and Pesce (including porchetta! and just one truffle pizza).   The space is split in two, with the dinning room, adorned in reds and whites, reminiscent of the Mediterranean coast of Italy. It's got a very modern yet elegant and royal feel. The second space gives more of an inter city at night vibe, with an excellent bar in the centre of the room, almost like an historic bow of a ship. The bar is headed by Nishan Nepulongoda, a global veteran, and fully stocked for scotch lovers and cocktail lovers alike.   Service is mature. Staff are older than Khabouth's typical formula, which reflects the perfection they're trying to achieve. It is Yorkville afterall. Currently, no patio is open yet, but there will be two (one in the north and a smaller more private one in the south). The front entrance to the restaurant is off the street, which adds a desired level of privacy. There's a lot of attention to detail at Sofia.   The only challenging part with Sofia will be competing with so many perfect Italian restaurants in Yorkville, but new novelty, a full menu, and an excellent bar may be their favour."}
