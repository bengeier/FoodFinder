{"text":"We had a great lunch on the patio today!  Our shrimp po boys sandwiches were very good.  The sweet potato fries and homemade potato chips were tasty too.  We also tried the kale side dish, which was good.  Our server, Kyle provided excellent, friendly service.  The food and wine is reasonably priced, we will be back."}
{"text":"We have been here a hand full of times. Great service...really nice owners..cute patio and awesome food! Great place for a date night oout!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mahi Mahi sandwich and it was wonderful!!  The Mahi was thick and cooked to a flavorful perfection. The sauce was the perfect compliment to the mildness of the fish as it has a very slight spicy bite to it. The homemade potato chips were crisp and tasty.  All this plus the beauty of a babbling creek off of the outdoor patio made my visit relaxing and memorable.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere new and found Tinkers Creek Road Tavern and decided to give it a try. Fish tacos we're outstanding, wife had the Walleye Special and was surprised and cousin had a burger impressed. The service was outstanding food was a total surprise. Awesome food on a small package. Don't let the outside appearance fool you, it's good."}
{"text":"Great experience. I was hesitant to go here after reading some of the reviews but the service was great and the blackened Red Snapper with crawfish and rice was exceptional. Nice decor, great patio by the river. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here today around 4pm. Seated right away. Waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. After looking over the menu, we decided to get the Nachos. These are not your typical nachos! Wonderfully , tender smoked pulled pork with a sweet and tangy bbq sauce topped the house made potato chips. The chips were still warm. There was melted cheese, salsa and nice thick sour cream. Plenty for us to share. They were absolutely delicious! We were too stuffed to order anymore food to eat .... HOWEVER... we did order a slab of ribs to go. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the strawberry margarita was a tad too sweet... But if there were 4 1/2 stars... I would give it to them. Prices were reasonable as well. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Picked this place as we had never been here and wanted to try something new. Our waitress Karen was awesome.  Felt like being at home....its mostly family run.  Food was good.  Servings were large.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and can honestly say I was quite impressed . The food was delicious the service was great and the scenery with Tinkers Creek there is quite awesome . The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was very loud in the eating area . Maybe it was just the crowd that night hard to say. I will definitely go back there this summer to enjoy the outdoor patio seating . Overall though a really nice experience ! Once again the food was delicious !!"}
{"text":"Meal was AWFUL! Mashed potatoes were cold as if been made night before and left in the fridge. Chicken was ... well ... still not sure it was chicken. Had a rubbery texture. Green beans were over cooked shriveled sadness on the plate. Diet Coke was flat. For a place that's not a sports bar why is the waitstaff in leggings and sports bras? Very tacky. Unprofessional management was complaining to us about table that left mess due to small child. Would have been happier to make PB&J and taken lawn chair up the creek to eat. Waste of money"}
{"text":"Never ordered any food but good drinks and a large dance floor and patio."}
{"text":"Went back this weekend for dinner.  This was my second visit, and both times the service has been slow.  This time was even worse.  Again, our server neglected to bring our bread.  It took him 15 minutes to bring out one water when we had asked for two.   They still haven't corrected the discrepencies on the menu.  Also, I ordered an alcohol-free mojito and was charged full price for it.   I'll probably still be back for the amazing patio, but with lowered expectations.  It's such a shame because I really want to love this place.  The food is good enough, and the overall experience isn't terrible, but they keep messing up on all the stuff that should be easy to get right!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there this past week. We were very pleased to find the service and food to be excellent. We look forward to returning to the Tavern in the near future!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a few years now and finally made it there. The patio is one of the cutest I've ever sat on and the food was really really good. The prices are reasonable for the dishes available and they have a wide range to choose from. The salmon was mild and perfectly cooked and the sweet potato raviolis complemented it well. The tomahawk steak was a special and had so much smoky flavor with a kick of spicy heat and juicy. Would've given 5 stars but at first we got an app and were taking awhile to order dinner so we were told we couldn't sit on patio if we didn't order dinner in the middle of our time there. They were supposed to tell us that when we were seated but didn't so just a heads up on that. The patio isn't that large either so more than likely there will be a wait on a nice day. I would definitely still recommend this place because of the atmosphere and food. The owner was very apologetic about the misunderstanding as well."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood spot. If you're looking for a reasonably priced spot with great views and classic American dishes, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"I need to start this review off by saying how much I wanted to LOVE this place. From the pictures on yelp and the reviews it seemed like the perfect place for date night.  Unfortunately the food was simply not good. It also wasn't bad.. We started off with the potato cups which were so cute and promising! They were edible but the \"bacon\" was just a ton of fat. Although the sour cream came with actual chives in it so that was a plus! The \"seasoned\" fries had zero taste. I also ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was covered in a not so tasty sauce. (Too sweet for me I like my bbq tangy just a personal preference) My husband had the pulled pork mac and cheese which I also tried and couldn't figure out why it tasted so off. It was a very large portion though which was nice.   We waited about 40 minutes for a seat outside (the reason I came was for the view) and we were seated all the way in the back.. couldn't see a thing except trees which is still nice but I would have loved to have had a river view. *A tip for those coming here make sure you ask to be seated next to the river not in the back."}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem after a bike ride down the Erie Canal towpath.  I felt like having a beer.  Great scenery especially in the fall! I would of ordered a meal and stayed for a 2nd or 3rd, but after reading the poor reviews AND the bar tender sneezing Into her hand then wiping her snot box she didn't even bother to wash her hands I opted out, got on my mountain bike and headed home.  Too bad looks like it would be a cool place to bring a date."}
{"text":"We shared the smoke sampler... Beef brisket, pulled pork, ribs, coleslaw, beers on the river and it was great. Smelled like home inside. Best kept secret in this part of town!!! Definitely a destination restaurant for date night or an anniversary!atmosphere is chill so you can relax with a group or by yourself really!!! Cheers"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of state and chose this place for dinner. It doesn't look like much from the outside but the parking lot was packed on a Thursday night so we saw that as a good sign! The meat on the smoker outside smelled great too! Food was great (we had the beef brisket sandwich, harvest salad, and tomato soup). We didn't sit on the patio because of the wait but it had a beautiful view with the creek and greenery surrounding. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place,  great food, nice staff,  good service and on a nice day an excellent place to enjoy dinner outside next to the river."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think much from the front entrance but this place is so cute and has an awesome patio next to the creek.  Great food too!"}
{"text":"The wife had lunch here with coworkers so we decided to have dinner... I had the Cuban sandwich it was excellent .... The only drawback was it was kind of loud(big party and they were all yelling over each other)... I will go back..."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Very nice, friendly atmosphere. Good variety of food on the menu and the smoked options are delicious. Kimberly was the bartender and our server and gave us fantastic, personable and attentive service. Will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a sunny summer late afternoon and the patio was packed so we decided to take a table inside.  The room we were in had a table next to a large picture window facing the patio so it was as if we were on an air conditioned patio.  Beautiful scenery.  The people I came with enjoyed their sandwiches and bbq.  But since I am the one writing the review I have to mention that I had an issue with my 'nachos.'  The menu nor the server said that it would come on potato chips.  To me that is loaded chips and not nachos.  The bbq pork on top was tasty but I was very disappointed to not get the nachos I thought I was ordering."}
{"text":"Love the patio on nice summer evenings.  It's overpriced, but I think it's worth it to hang there once in a while.  I've had decent success with the food, it's not that kind of meal that takes your breath away and makes you want to abandon how you look and just be obese, but it's good.  I wish the food was a little cheaper and a little better, that'd be enough to double the amount I go and could be the difference between 3 and 5 stars.  Just too much reliance on how cool the location is."}
{"text":"Food was average as was the price, good value for what you get.  Service was very good, but the place was VERY loud"}
{"text":"The historic building is great and it is nestled between a bunch of small cities on the outskirts of Cleveland; however, the restaurant part fails. Expensive food choices litter a very limited menu. The service staff is unfriendly and the drinks are unreasonably expensive. Avoid this place if you can!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times at this point.  The food is a solid step better than bar grub.  The beer list is pretty solid, and the coctails are on point.  I've had the tacos, the salmon with brown butter, a few of the specials and have never had a bad meal.  The apps are delicious. I've had the Sicilian and the standard calamari, and the potato cups.  They were all worth the bucks.  For dessert try the crazy creme Brule!  All that said, the setting is worth the trip alone. Try the patio on the summer.  I really like this place, but I did deduct a star.  I've overheard the staff say some pretty unsavory things about customers and I just don't care for it.  They need to decide if they're a roadside dive bar, or a decent eating establishment and then make their staff conduct themselves accordingly."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite go-to restaurant in the area for its location, food, history, and service. I've liked everything I've ordered but the grilled salmon with sweet potato ravioli and spinach comes to mind as the most notable. We may need to visit this weekend for a fix!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes and have heard good things about this place. It started out fine and walked right in and were seated on the patio. We were served our drinks promptly but seemed ro go downhill from there.  Kymberly, our waitress, seemed to have developed an attitude, evidenced by missing food, not returning to refill drinks, checking up..regular waitress duties and some of the food was cold. Then the bill, came which 2 members of our 5 person party were splitting the tab. Kymberly ignored our request and charged one card twice. When confronted, extra attitude arrived from Kymberly.  She was tipped based on her sub par personality and service. Upon checking bank accounts the next day, someone had changed her tip amount for the better! Whoa. Will not be returning. Thanks for a spoiling a potential nice birthday dinner for me."}
{"text":"The potato cups were delicious. Unfortunately, my buffalo chicken salad had more romain lettuce ribs than lettuce leaves. The waitress stated \"you should have told me- would you like one to go as a replacement?\" My response was \" I would have but you never came back \".  The music was great and I will try them again.  Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Awesome patio views.  Stopped in for an appetizer and a drink.  The Memphis Nachos are delicious!  A must try. Server was pleasant and efficient. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The setting is beautiful - I'll give them that.  Five stars for the creek itself.  However, if you can't get a table outside by the creek, or if it's a typical Cleveland evening of humidity and/or rain, just don't bother.  The menu has pretty limited food options that are not worth the wait, the cost, or the calories."}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork mac n cheese, breathtaking patio with scenic river/woods view, kind waitress. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for early dinner after s long afternoon of Christmas shopping. I always forget about this place since it's a little off the beaten path.  My husband and I both had the mac & cheese topped with pulled pork. Excellent meal! The service was great, the view of the creek awesome, and great food.   We will certainly make a point of coming here more frequently."}
{"text":"I remember this place growing up but never had a reason to go. I'm glad I finally had an opportunity to try it out and look forward to trying again.   The good: setting is perfect, adjacent to Tinkers Creek, and the patio is perfect on a nice summer evening. So cool. Staff was nice, manager checked in several times, waiter was very patient with our large crowd. Craft beer list is very good. Diverse menu.   The bad: food was ok. No one in the party seemed to rave about the food. The ribs were ok (but I am spoiled living in Kansas City - I should have known better).   Overall this is a solid 4. I will visit again for the atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"Pretty average visit for me, I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely return for the fried goat cheese salad!   CONS -If you have a party of 6 or more you cannot sit on the patio unless you break your party up. This was disappointing since their patio is very nice.  -Service was wishy washy  -Bar staff was very loud and had no filter. If I'm trying to enjoy dinner I don't want to listen to what you did last night.   PROS -The fried goat cheese salad was awesome, plus I added salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the goat cheese was delicious!  -Nice patio  -Good variety of food options  -Reasonable prices, including alcohol ($6 wine)"}
{"text":"Most of the staff is a little wild, obviously family members employed, no filter. Our waiter was great though. He recommended the fried goat cheese salad and it was great. I added grilled chicken and got the blood orange vinaigrette dressing instead. Such a great mix! Atmosphere on the water is really nice too so sit outside if you can, not too late though cause the bugs will get ya! Bf got the burger, not crazy about it, but the fries were really tasty!"}
{"text":"Went with a larger party after a great experience at the Big Red Barn Theater two minutes down the road.  Service was sort of odd -- they have youngish kids taking drink orders, which seems strange.  Our server spilled most of our drinks by attempting to hand them down the table, giving my 9-year-old about 3 sips worth of a mojito on his menu without a word of apology.  Service overall was sort of up-and-down -- refills took awhile, certain requests took forever (ketchup, extra dressing, more napkins).  Food was pretty decent, nothing special or particularly innovative but not bad.  The building is comfortable and laid back, and the back patio looked beautiful.  Nice for an in-the-area meal but I wouldn't drive there for dinner if I didn't live close by."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant with a great beer selection. The customer service from the greeting to the table wait service was good. The selection on the menu is abundant and offers something for everyone. We tried the Memphis nachos as an appetizer for the table. They had pulled pork on them and let me just say, Deilicious! I wasn't very hungry so ended up ordering the chicken wings and they were also flavorful and filling. My friend brags about this place and I can comfortably give it 4 stars in relation to friendly and prompt staff, great food selection and also very tasty! Lit does wen to be a bit out of the way but with the drive!"}
{"text":"Only redeeming thing were the drinks. Apps were terrible and dinners were worse.  Ordered 4 apps. Spinach/artichoke dip was greasy.  Calamari was frozen and the sauce was disgusting. The same terrible sauce on the fried mozzarella.  Pretzel bites were doused in an over spicy queso.  Burgers and filet over cooked. Pulled pork tasted like cinnamon. Brisket was tough. Ribs were too spicy to eat.  Never mind the nonexistent parking.  Not sure why it was so busy. I've heard nothing but great things about this place and planned a birthday dinner there. Was so embarrassed.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"I ws a fan of the new management, but in the last 6 months something's happened.  The staff is still friendly and attentive, but the food just doesn't make it.  Had a fish taco, and this wouldn't cut it in SoCal.   Fried fish flopped on some some lettuce, in a tortilla  not too healthy.  Also had a burger which wasn't much better.  I hope the food gets back to where it was, because the setting doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"The food is great along with the atmosphere. I have never had a negative visit always a great time and experience keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This place is really quite fantastic. The patio is beautiful, and even if you have to sit inside, the floor to ceiling windows still allow you to enjoy the spectacular views. We ordered the spinach dip with pitas, it was all very fresh, warm, and tasted homemade from scratch.  We ordered a couple of craft beers they had on draft, they were perfectly poured and ice cold - yum!  We had burgers for our entrees. Northeast Ohio has a ton of burger places, and really good ones at that, so this place has a lot of competition ... Or so I thought. My burger was cooked exactly how I asked and was literally one of thee best burgers I have ever had. I'm not even kidding. It was smack-yo-momma good.  Our server was very friendly and just the right amount of attentive.   Only con to this place that we found was that the acoustics inside the restaurant were such that it made everyone's voices carry and we found ourselves almost having to yell at each other to have a conversation. But don't let that deter you from going - the view, food and service all make up for it!"}
{"text":"We were VERY impressed with our first visit. If return visits are equally impressive, this will become a 5 star place for us! It was a random find after a bike path ride. The atmosphere is fantastic with a beautiful patio, when the weather allows, overlooking a creek. Inside has cozy ambiance with plenty of Windows and excellent views. Other reviewers stated the noise being an issue, but when we were here it was during the day and I could not assess that but could see it being an issue if it were busy.   The whole menu all looked tempting. It was upscale bar food. They had a large smoker in the parking lot where they smoke their own pork, brisket and ribs. The pulled pork nachos we ordered were delicious and came out on their homemade potato chips, rather than tortilla chips, which stated crispy until the end. The smoke flavor was noticeable. The sweet potato tots were also very good. The cocktail list was extensive and the beer list very adequate. There were also wine selections that I didn't look closely enough at to mention.   The service was attentive and helpful. With a craft bottled beer and a martini added, the bill came to $29. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The mahi mahi sandwich is too delicious to pass up!  I get it in a wrap and it's so good!  Plus, beer is always cold with the frosted mug!  Family owned and they are all so kind and friendly.  Keeps my family and I coming back and you can't beat the view of the creek!"}
{"text":"This place has a great location with a cute patio overlooking the creek. I had the Sicilian calamari appetizer, a huge portion arrived in a giant soup bowl. It was awesome. Also tried the salmon. It had a delicious charred edge and was cooked perfectly. The only fault was the BBQ chicken had an overpowering wood smoke taste.   We sat in the bar area and the bartender worked her butt off tending bar and waiting tables inside and outside as well."}
{"text":"My sister and I had a nice lunch a couple weeks ago and really enjoyed the patio and food, so I suggested to my husband we go for dinner. We will never go back for dinner. Service was so slow. We thought we would try the ribs and pulled pork. Ribs were dry, too burned and tasteless....even when I asked for sauce. Pulled pork was dry and awful. This place is very hit or miss. The tacos I had at the lunch were great. The sweet potato tater tots are good."}
{"text":"I have visited over the summer. Wonderful place to go and relax. Outside seating is the best. Food is awesome. Weekends get really busy."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in - Walton Hills, OH? I've never even heard of that, I thought it was actually in Valley View.  Either way, I feel like this place isn't well known but its a nice find.  Tucked away in the middle of this woodsy area, it offers delicious food in a neat, historic old building.  Their website tells of some of its history, and apparently has one of the oldest records in Ohio for obtaining a liquor license.  I don't work too far away from this place, and I haven't been here in a while - I think I may gather some coworkers to check it out again one day soon.  They have a patio, which sounds perfect for an after-work happy hour.  Nearby is the well-known Tinker's Creek Cemetery.  The most  \"recent\" burial dates back to the 1800s.  Before even that it is also known for being a mass indian burial site.  Creepy! I'd love to go up here sometime and take pictures of the old gravestones."}
{"text":"This place makes me sad  The location is great. I love the building and the setting.  The new menu is also really good.  So why am I sad?  The staff has been just plain rude to us.  I understand having difficult days and all that. However .....  The owner (I think) or maybe the manager and the service staff were incredibly rude and boorish.  Not once, not twice, but three of the four times we've gone there.  One time we got an unwanted lecture on politics, another we were treated very poorly, a third time we were ignored.   So, we won't go back.   And I hate to say this.  We live nearby and the food is good. But, I won't put up with the treatment any longer."}
{"text":"Awesome....awesome !!! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, extremely clean, and best of all the food is excellent !!! First timer .. will be coming back for sure !!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last Saturday 1/13/18 with friends celebrating a Birthday. The ambiance is okay but the room is very noisy. However, the service was very good. two people in the party had to send drinks back because they could not taste any liquor. The appetizers were sub-par. I can't speak for anyone else but my dinner was very sub par. My wife and I split a chicken breast dinner including green beans and mashed potatoes. The potatoes arrived cold and we sent them back, but that was the least of the problem. The chicken breasts weren't breasts in the true sense. They were made of pressed chicken meat. They were marginally edible. I know these things because I owned a food distributorship for 33 years. If you are planning a meal at this establishment it would be best to wait for the warmer weather and go for lunch and sit outside by the creek. Very nice. Dinner at your own risk."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Cannot believe I have never been here before. The location is right on the creek so the patio overlooks the water. Inside is very homey and comfortable. The food was delicious. I'm not a BBQ fan but they have their own smoker and it was super tasty. Prices were very reasonable. Service was above average. We learned about the owners and who some of the staff were because they were friendly enough to come over and chat about our experience. Definitely a spot to check out for a killer patio and comfort food!"}
{"text":"What a cozy little place to visit just down the road from a Christmas tree farm. Could also pair well with a hike or bike ride at Bedford Reservation. Or just enjoy sitting along Tinkers Creek.  Another locale with a good beer selection; not a huge list, but full of craft variety.  The \"nachos\" with pulled pork were a great start, but might have filled us up for a lunchtime meal. Boys loved the chips and their irregular sizes.  Owen wasn't a huge fan of the chicken tacos, because he forgot to specify no onions and they were chopped up, so they couldn't be picked off. Otto went for 6 BBQ wings and gave them two thumbs up.  Read about the fried goat cheese salad in a previous review, so I went for that. The goat cheese was great, but I should have asked for the sundried tomato dressing on the side. Hubby enjoyed their steak sandwich and onion rings."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but rather average. Service dismal. One person in my party (of 8) didn't receive their meal until after everyone else was done eating. It was clearly the fault of the server who failed to put in the order, who didn't offer an apology. This server was also...how to put this...very \"blah\". No personality, unfriendly and a lack of charisma; Perhaps he didn't feel like working after the Memorial Day weekend...? I don't know but I will say at first glance, I was considering this place for my wedding shower - and now, well, I don't know that I'll be returning. Or, if I did, I would ensure I requested a different server."}
{"text":"The previous posts are accurate in describing the setting.  A group of co-workers and I went there after work just so we could enjoy the patio.  We knew to arrive early on a Friday, or you can't get a table outside.  We are teachers and get off early, so we are able to get there around 3:30 pm.  We proceeded to enjoy very nice cocktails and good food out on the patio over the course of a few hours.  We had more people meeting us and were happily relaxed when we were asked by the bartender to give up our table and move inside.  Mind you we had spent about $100.00 between us and the new people meeting us planned to eat and drink as well.    We were caught off guard and asked why we needed to move, it's not like we weren't ordering drinks, and we were told that people were waiting for the table and they have a 90 minute seating limit on the patio.  This is not posted anywhere in the restaurant and we were not told this when we were sat.  We asked what would happen if we didn't care to move and the bartender said she was just doing her job and a meaner \"boss lady\" would have to come over.  We spotted the owner and asked her to come speak with us.  She quickly confirmed that she asked the bartender to ask us to leave the table and when we suggested that she post the 90 minute seating rule, she came back with \"I don't have time for this\" and walked away.    I am summarizing this conversation because we spent several minutes trying to understand where this rude, cold, ridiculous customer service was coming from.  All I can figure is we didn't have on gold attire and she felt we weren't important enough customers.  The funny thing is, we have gone there in the middle of winter when the place is empty and spent money when the golfers weren't around.    As she walked away, we did let her know that we had ordered more drinks and never received them.  She did not acknowledge the comment.  When we were leaving she pulled a member of our party aside and said that our drinks weren't served becasue we were cut off.  Then the owner proceeded to put her hand in our friends face.  I have never experience this kind of thing before and will never go back.  If 3 drinks over the course of 21/2-3 hours gets you cut off, even after you have ordered and eaten dinner then she's right, this isn't the place for me.  What a shame!!"}
{"text":"Rude management!! Food average at best and certainly not good enough to overcome being treated poorly by a couple of ogres. Try eddies creekside for nice view !"}
{"text":"I give this place zero stars, first it was a 45 minute wait, then the service was super slow finally the icing on the cake after about 45 minutes we were approached by an ogar of a women and asked to move tables so another couple could sit down to eat. We still had full drinks on the table and we're not ready to leave or move. She justified it by saying \"that's how we do it here\" horrible never go back again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere- I give that four and a half stars. The food- that's about three stars.  We stopped by here on a fall Saturday afternoon- it's a gorgeous place to go, as the outside seating overlooks the metroparks, and with fall, it was nice to sit by the water with the rustling of the leaves, and being in the changing of the colors as well. So, for the view, it's worth it.  The food was decent. He had the mahi mahi sandwich- which, actually came out with a giant mahi mahi fillet on it - so that was definitely worth the money. I got the smoked beef brisket- it was good, definitely saucy. The food was good quality- just nothing was real interesting about the menu- just your standard restaurant.  The patio was packed though- apparently a lot of people know about how nice of a view this restaurant has.   I would imagine this restaurant would probably make a nice date for those who are not adventurous eaters, as it's quite the nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot off the beaten path. Its a scenic location with a nice patio. I went in the afternoon for lunch and it was great. The food is good as well as the drinks. We went another time and tried for dinner but it had a wait so we did not stay. You may want to call ahead for dinner in case it is busy"}
{"text":"BBQ salmon salad with mandarin oranges was great. Highly recommended. It's tasted as good as it looked."}
{"text":"Perfect outdoor peaceful patio. No drafts, but good food (tad pricey).  I'd suggest wine and the BBQ. Odd combination, but seems to be their best strengths."}
{"text":"In the Cuyahoga Valley National Park,  a little restaurant with a nice vibe. Amazing pulled pork. And the pulled pork natchos were scarfed up at our tabke by all 6 diners. Cakamari was tasty and tender. All 6 loved their entrees.  Nice wine and beer list and a great Manhattan served in a unique twisted glass for only $7.00! [I'm from the NYC area.] Nice outdoor dining on the creek and fully handicapped accessible.  Go!"}
{"text":"Really great place. The patio is gorgeous! Right on the creek and you hear the water flowing, very peaceful! I had the mahi mahi dish which was delicious! It had a very smiley flavor and was very unique! The nachos and mac & cheese looked divine! The staff was very friendly! I will definitely come again to try and snag a spot outside!"}
{"text":"I was waiting on my husband to finish his bike ride so I stopped in here for a few glasses of wine and an appetizer at the bar. They had good bar specials and the wine selection was ok. I ordered my husband the mahi mahi sandwich to go which he loved!  I would like to come back in the summer and check out what looks like a really cool patio."}
