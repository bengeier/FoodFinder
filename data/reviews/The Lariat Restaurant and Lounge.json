{"text":"Visited lariat grill for the first time in many years...we participated in restaurant week.  I had the French onion soup, halibut and a churro bowl with ice cream.  My husband had the caprese stack, filet and chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse filling.  We also added the wine pairing to our 3 course meal.  The atmosphere is beautiful...old world elegant Arizona.  There was a classical pianist playing in the adjacent bar.  The food was outstanding and the wines were perfectly paired to make for a very delicious evening.  Will definitely go back again soon.  Want to visit the lobby bar...looks like a local hot spot."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a nice quiet dinner with friends.  Well it was very quiet.  We arrived at 6:15 PM on a Wednesday the place was empty and it was pretty empty when we left at 8:40 too.  There was a bit of a communication issue with the waiter when we were ordering drinks but that got resolved fairly quickly.  Once we did get our drinks the waiter asked if we would like to order.  We told him we need a bit to relax, and go over the menu.  That was the last we saw him until one member in our party got up to find someone to help us.  Two managers were over in the corner the whole time talking up a storm but not giving the dinning room any attention.  Once our waiter was summoned we did place our order.  We all had starters which were good.  The tuna tartar, calamari and soup was a nice start.  The service was slow and getting the food out was exceptionally slow.  Our friends' soup came out way before our tuna tartar and calamari.  Our dinner took uber long too.  Although the portion size was nice my husband and I could not eat the trout.  It was hard and over cooked.  Again, we didn't see our waiter and getting someone over to our table wasn't happening.  It also seems that the server we had was the only one on for the night.  The two managers certainly weren't managing either. The dinning room is comfortable and surroundings are nice but it certainly didn't make up for the very poor service and mediocre food.  We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason for two stars is a nice wait staff! 
Pizza was the worst pizza ever!  We sent it back three times to actually get a pizza that was done! First two times soggy white tasteless plate!! Thank goodness for some beer to wash it down!! Yes, we ate the whole thing, but we had paid for it and were hungry!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks at 530 pm  Took  15 minutes to serve us. Two friends showed up at 5.50 and asked for happy hour drinks -2 wine 2 bloody marys The bar person brought them at 6 pm  with the bill for 2 times the price . He was asked about bill and he stated he forgot about happy hour and did not mix happy hour drinks and walked off not fixing problem ! We were seated for dinner 6.05 pm I asked front desk to send a person to our table at 6.35 pm At 7.05 the four people at my table were served our meal . No silverware or salt and pepper . I got up at 7.15 asked for 4 waters  . They never filled them at table and never asked if we wanted anything else. I called and asked for manager to give me a call and it has been a week   No CALL!         WE have been going there  for 3 years. I feel we got ripped off!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Amazing views with the sun setting! Our dinner was excellent, my husband had the pork chops and I had the Tuscan pasta. Service was professional, very friendly and timing was spot on. They never rushed us and we were able to enjoy our bottle of wine during and after. Great place for groups as well. After dinner we went our on the patio and enjoyed the stars and view of Black Mountain in the moonlight. Perfect summer evening here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to our Christmas buffet and it was absolutely a complete ripoff.  The little food they had left at 11:00 am which is when our reservation was for was terrible.  The omelet person
said they ran out of most of the omelet ingredients and can get more
from the back if we want some.  The potatoes in the buffet line were cold
All that was left was some bacon and sausage also cold.
We did not get any danish, bread etc.  I had to run around to find a waiter since there was only one and the hostess was not there when we came in to seat us for the first 25 minutes.  I had to get the bartender to give us a seat.  The coffee came after we finished the plain omelet.  Then they charged 20% gratuity for us waiting on our selves.  They were very short handed to say the least.  Bottom line no service no food to speak of and 
cost us over $70.00

{"text":"I've lived in the far north valley for several years now and never knew this place existed, let alone existing in a resort that I've never heard of. 

With the exception of dessert, the food was good.  My scallops were prepared perfectly and while my lobster bisque was somewhat underseasoned, it was tasty as well.  My vanilla/strawberry cake was dry, nearly flavorless and the icing was terrible.  

Despite having a decent meal, I don't think I'll return and here's why:  Remember the ballroom scene in The Shining when Jack walks in and it's completely empty? That's how this restaurant felt.  We were the only people in there and although the restaurant was pretty inside, it faces the pool/room area which is nice enough but lacking considering it's down the street from The Boulders.  It was honestly kind of depressing."}
{"text":"LOBSTERLICIOUS!!!!!  The hubby and I decided to create a night of indulgence and decadence on a Tuesday night.  We had been so busy the previous month that we hadn't celebrated either birthday OR a milestone anniversary.  We figured the Grille would probably pass with a C or C+, considering we hadn't heard much about their dinner menu.  And we were wrong.  VERY wrong - happily wrong.  The filet was melt in your mouth tender, the lobster was perfectly cooked, quivering on that tail.   Our waitress was informative, happy, and graciously kind.  We discovered on a subsequent trip about their seafood buffet on the 1st of every month, which may exceed the Thursday night Burger Night, which includes a juicy cheeseburger, side, AND a GLASS OF WINE OR BEER!!!  FOR TEN BUCKS!!  What a DEAL!!  Strongly suggest you get reservations."}
{"text":"The food was exceptionally good and the service was equally excellent. There were 3 of us for lunch. I had Italian Dip, another had Pepperoni Pizza, and the third had California Club. The presentation was superb. Even the pepperoni pizza didn't have that excessive grease floating on the concave portion of the pepperoni that was on the pizza. The chef must be very attention oriented. Italian Dip had beef that was cooked just right, so that when I dipped the sandwich into the au jus, everything got soaked evenly and properly. California Club was cut so evenly and into equal sized portion, you could have measured it. Again, the chef must have been very attentive.

My associates and I will definitely return when I am in this part of town again."}
{"text":"If you've ever gotten the feeling, when you've gone in to a restaurant, that if you didin't play by their rules they didn't want you there. This place is the prototype. I was warned by a number of people the food has progressing but watch out for the service. Boy......I should have listened. 

The valet couldn't figure out how to drive my car. I parked it myself. The waiter forgot the glasses for our water so I picked them from another table. No bread. NO shrimp forks. The bartender couldn't fathom two simple drinks we requested. An incorrectly labeled dish was made worse when we sent it back. I was approached by the manager \"in training\" insinuating she knew me and I was a troublemaker. I'd never seen her before nor was I ever in the restaurant before.

I could keep going. Great script for the Twilight Zone...or \"Weekday Dinner at your Mother-in Laws\"

The sad part is they all supported one another. Clique management. The MOD was the most intaganistic of them all.

Sad Sad Sad. The one star is for the food. The service was negative off the charts. If you have to go...go soon. It won't be there too long."}
{"text":"Although the Lariat Restaurant's overall rating is so-so, more recent reviews tended to move it up a category, so we decided to try it last night.   Our  experience tends to support the recent ones.

We had two seafood dishes: the almond-encrusted trout and the atlantic salmon.  Both were good, but neither were outstanding or innovative.  

The almond coating was very light on almonds, and heavy on the batter, but the quality of the trout was very  good.  I thought it was a tad bit over done, but my spouse disagreed.  The lemon butter sauce nicely accompanied the trout. Overall, the preparation was very good.The  cheese risotto was excellent.

The salmon was good, but the preparation was not particularly interesting.  The mashed potatoes were good, but, again, nothing special.

Both dishes were accompanied by fresh asparagus,  and it was nice and crispy...beautifully done.

The service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  He seemed to really care about our experience.

Overall, we enjoyed the dinner, and as a conference hotel restaurant,  it does reasonably well."}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start? I am kind of on a mission to try all the restaurants in the Cave Creek / Carefree area to try and expand our \"circle of restaurants\". The Lariat was - by far - the worst restaurant I've been to in a long, long time. The full extent of the inane disorganization of this establishment wasn't discovered until the following morning after our visit. 

Upon arrival, was promptly seated by the hostess and had water and bread delivered fairly rapidly to the table by a non-talking deliverer, but so far so good.... Then, a full 20 minutes went by before we were even acknowledged by our waiter, who came to get our drink orders. Well, we didn't even have a wine list... so another wait to grab the wine list and decide on the fly (we could've had 20 minutes to decide had we been given the wine list with the menus). We ordered 1 soda and two glasses of wine by the glass. 

The waiter returns a little while later to get our meal order. I ask if the scallops, trout, or halibut is better and he replies he doesn't eat seafood. Ok, then, I'll have the trout I guess. Prime rib special for hubby and mussels and hot dog (kids meal) for the kid. 

Another 25 minutes passes, we are OUT of water and OUT of bread and STILL no wine or waiter in sight. I flag down an official-looking person and asked if she was the manager, and she confirmed that she was. I explained that we had been sitting for 45 minutes and still had no drinks and were even out of water at this point. She apologized and said she would \"do something about our bill.\" 

She returned with our wine (still no waiter?) and another 15 minutes passes.... waiter does not return and nowhere in sight... so I flag the manager down again because I'm ready for glass #2 of wine or I'll have nothing with dinner. Dinner comes literally 30 seconds after the manager fetched my glass of wine. Had I not flagged her down, I would've been out of drinks - again - for my meal. 

Now, for the meal review.... mussels were \"ok\" according to child. My trout was breaded in an almond crust that was mushy and unappealing looking. It wasn't inedible, but I felt like I was having the fish special at Sizzler. Hubby's butter lettuce salad was drowning in a thick, store-bought tasting dressing. The kids meal with hot dog was utterly disgusting. NO exaggeration, the bun was as hard as a rock... as if it had been sitting out for weeks uncovered. I have no clue how anyone put a hot dog in that rock bun and didn't think to themselves, \"Hmmmm, this bun just might be hard enough to chip someone's tooth!\" I wouldn't have fed that bun to ducks at the park. 

Mercifully, our meal is over. Yet, we have another painful wait for our check, which they were so kind as to comp us \"one glass\" of wine. Maybe it was my glass since I complained? What about hubby who also waited 45 minutes for his? 

Now, for the icing on the cake of the worst-restaurant-experience-in-history: Hubby wakes up in the morning and goes to store and realizes The Lariat never returned his credit card with the check the prior evening. Maybe they thought they would keep it so they could try and re-charge us for that glass of wine ;) So, we had to spend time cancelling the credit card on top of the travesty of the evening. 

It's obvious that this restaurant caters to hotel guests and doesn't care about locals at all. Most of the guests in the restaurant were north of 70 years old. This is only relevant because I suspect it's not the demographic that is running around posting online reviews. Otherwise, I suspect this restaurant would be in big, big trouble and I would've steered WAY clear of this place had there been more honest reviews."}
{"text":"Came for the special taco tuesday.   They were not good...had the fish and steak tacos. They fish were like fishsticks and the steak was dried up little pieces of some sort of meat.   Not worth 2.50/each.   Drinks were not worth 5.00 either...nothing spectacular for happy hour.   Hame been to many other places for happy hour and food and drinks were much better..price wise and taste wise!  Nice atmosphere though outside, but happy hour is at the bar only."}
{"text":"On January 6 we chose to have dinner at the Lariat.  We had a wonderful experience! The food was 4 star in that it was good and tasty, however our server, Branko, was 5 star plus! He as attentive, humorous, present when you needed him however not cloying and intrusive. He made helpful suggestions regarding the wine and entree selection which were much appreciated. At one point in the meal we began to feel a draft at our table and Branko moved heaven and earth to eliminate that for us. I highly recommend the Lariat for dining and suggest that diners request Branko as their server.  He will make you feel like family.  Thanks Branko!"}
{"text":"Okay, so last Friday we decided to try out the Famous Seafood Buffet the Lariat Grill at Carefree Resort and Conference Center puts on the first Friday of every month.

Well.  Stick with the Saturday night prime rib special.

Seriously, what a disappointment.  First off, cold.  The dining room was cold, the food was cold, and the food that was supposed to be cold, like the peeled shrimp and crab legs were literally icy.  It was cute how they had the soups sitting on these little stacks of brick with a burner hidden inside, but the heat wasn't getting to the soup.  

The Caprese salad was good.

DH doesn't do seafood, so he ordered a filet mignon, medium rare.  It arrived so well done the meat was a dark taupe.  And it and the baked potato were...cold.  Yeah, he sent it back but in the meantime, I am dutifully eating (but not enjoying) the seafood buffet because that cost $33.  DH's filet was $36.  The server did say DH could go hit the buffet for anything he wanted while they re-fired the filet, but the reason he didn't order the buffet in the first place was because he doesn't like seafood!  

It took (I timed it) almost 17 minutes to get the re-fired filet back out.  By that time, I had moved on to the desserts.  They were okay, tasted better then the fish, but they were all commercially prepared.  And all heavy, dense chocolate.  I would say the little mousse cakes (sort of like those Philly cheesecake/Nilla wafer things) were the best.  A lighter dessert option would have been nice.

We would never, ever go back for the seafood buffet.  And frankly, was this our first experience with The Lariat, probably never go back at all!  But that prime rib we had a couple of Saturday nights ago was really good.  So we'll try the Saturday night special again and see if the quality is maintained.  Was it's goodness that night an anomaly---or was the horridness of our experience this past Friday?  Enquiring minds want to know...."}
{"text":"Four of us went there for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It is inside of a resort and was quiet and enjoyable.  They have outdoor seating which would be wonderful when it is cooler as it is around the pool and you could enjoy the sunset.  I had the scallops which were cooked just right and were very tasty.  Service was very good.  They are open until 10 pm and things pretty well shut down at that time.  However, it was restful, good food and enjoyable.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day and was completely blown away. The food was fresh and delicious. The service was incredible. We loved it so much that we are going back for dinner Monday and plan to add this to our list of \" go to\" restaurants. I cannot wait to try the regular menu"}
{"text":"I will never drink or eat here! Between waiting at the bar over five minutes to be waited on, to having the manager serve us, to not bring acknowledged the entire time we sat there with empty drinks. No one bothered checking on us, refilling our drinks, etc. Worst service! Tempted to check out!"}
{"text":"I won some gift certificates at a charity raffle and we decided to drive up to Carefree to use them.  It took us 2 trips to use up the certificates, but it was worth the drive.  We were pleasantly surprised to find a decent restaurant.  Here's what we ordered:

Pepperoni Pizza, $11.95

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lariat-grill-carefree?select=DdD7DaEOCZpEUfvNkSiO3Q#DdD7DaEOCZpEUfvNkSiO3Q

The Pizza was very good....I definitely did not expect to find decent Pizza in this place.  The Bacon Cheeseburger was so/so, but the Onion Rings were delish....crispy and full of flavor.  The Better Half had the Atlantic Salmon and she enjoyed it.  I'm a huge fan of Caprese Salad, and they do it very well here.  The Roast Beef Sandwich was very good as well.

The service during both visits was very good.  Overall, a good experience.  I just wish it was closer to the city.

{"text":"We have been here a few times  (summer 2016). Honestly we should've come sooner, but the reviews weren't  that positive. Now we are starting to love it. Bronco is a server who is a constant, responsive though sometimes they're understaffed....yet he still manages to deliver great service even in those times with the help of his service staff. The rest of the servers could use polishing and training, but we knew that that going into it.  This is not going to be a formal, stuffy, perfect experience. This will be a good experience: they do a good job at a good value. Burger night on Thursdays (make a reservation during winter!)...great burgers customized  with the toppings you choose (blue cheese, carmelized onions and mushrooms, hold the bun!), a solid crunchy healthy pickle, and your wine is included. Yes I said that. Your wine is included. Then there's Prime Rib night on Saturdays. Select your doneness, baked or mashed (incredibly amazing mashed, I might add, so amazing my hubs still talks about them the next day), and broccoli or spinach (also amazing...the perfect amount of garlic). Comes with horseradish cream and aus jus.  Their salad with champagne dressing is great (and has toasted corn sprinkled on it, which I love). Their Caesar salad also great. Pretzel bread and rolls on the table.  We are next trying their weekend brunch, and when they have the seafood buffet (one Friday a month in season), we are going to find a seat and try it out. Their dessert tray could use a little sprucing, as by the time we see it the desserts look sad. I've heard they're great (we've yet to save room from dinner to eat dessert) .  I gave it a 4 star review because of the service issues that are easily overlooked if you're prepared. Let's be honest: if we were paying $39 for that prime rib instead of $19,  those service issues would not be so easily tolerated. But for such a value, the support server can reach across my plate to fill the water glass of the person next to me, and forget to bring a steak knife  for one person at the table, and give the knives he does have to be men at the table first.  And, we love the history of this place. It's throw back and cool, like Dick Van Dyke cool. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Lariat Grille. Some of the best breakfast I have ever had and a great dinner too. I stayed at the resort however I am sure you can stroll on in and relax with a nice meal and sweet service. Enjoy.

Get the hue is rancheros. I've had worse in Mexico and better almost nowhere!

Amazing as far as hotel restaurants go."}
{"text":"We were in town for a family event and were staying at the hotel. With not many restaurants near by we decided to eat at the hotel. The place was empty and we walked right in. We were greeted after a few minutes. I was a little surprised that the entrees were so expensive. We decided to get a soup, salad and the antipasti plate. First off the soup ( French onion) was the highlight of the meal, delicious! The greens salad was good but not anything great. However the antipasti plate was a real let down.  The cheese seemed like it had been sitting out and the meat was noting special just some chopped up ham and salami. When I asked for some bread, the waiter told me that because it was slow he didn't know if any with available And it wasn't. The veggies were ok but didn't save the plate. I love a great cheese and meat plate and I was just so disappointed. On the up side because I didn't finish it I had room for dessert. The flourless chocolate cake was very good. I added two scoops of chocolate gelato to make the perfect desert. I really wish this place would have had a little more for me it would have been a great dinner instead of an average one."}
{"text":"We went there twice last week and had 2 different experiences as a hotel guest in the Carefree resort.  Monday night dinner. Fine, better than fine. Good service, good food and it was quiet, not many patrons so we were well taken care of.....no complaints.

Thursday morning breakfast. Terrible. 
They were expecting a large group to come in but we were ahead of the group by 5 minutes and the first guests in. No-one brought us any water (until after we finished breakfast) despite being the only people in the restaurant for 5 whole minutes.

The menu was cancelled and we had a buffet due to the large group I presume. This would be okay but the buffet was really poor. It felt like the food was made hours ago and reheated. Fruit wasn't particularly fresh.
The tip was included on the check. We cant figure out for what as we received no water, we got our own food and yet they included a service charge of TWENTY PERCENT, not 15, but 20. That took some cheek.  We didnt contest it , too much effort. We'd rather just report it here and hope someone reads it and decides against going. That was a truly awful breakfast.

I tend to leave very positive reviews when I make the effort to actually do this but this was a really big letdown. I couldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place. Fine food, tasty beer and good people in a nice location. So good in fact that I bought the refillable beer stein (#9). Looking forward to relaxing in the bier garten in summer. Hope you'll have motorcycle parking."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our anniversary. The service was mediocre and my food was cold :( our waiter was trying his best but I think they were short staffed both our in front and in the kitchen. We heard another couple dining next to us send their food back too. If you are here at the Carefree Resort and want to stay in the complex to eat. This is your only choice. I think you would have better service at a fast-food chain."}
{"text":"Old school, not fancy, but pretty, quiet, clean, and friendly staff. Food is tasty and fresh. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Resort from 1/17-1/18. 
For breakfast, I went to the Lariat - or at least I tried to. I've been waiting at the front counter hoping for someone to show me to a table. I've been standing here for 14 minutes, as I'm writing this review. I'm going to Albertsons to get some Hot Pockets instead."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner. All of the food ordered has been delicious - California Benedict, bananas foster waffles, salmon blt, fried calamari, fish/ chicken tacos! Overall I've been very pleased because not all hotel/resort restaurants are all that good."}
