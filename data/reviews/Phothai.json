{"text":"I ordered an entree of spring rolls. The rolls tasted very fresh and peanut sauce was OK. I then ordered Salt and Pepper Calamari (sometimes known as Salt and Pepper squid in other Asian restaurants). I am a huge salt and pepper squid fan. I ordered it \"extra crispy\" just in case because some places deliver it soggy. This place however has a very good S&P calamari, crispy and just the right amount of spicy. Lastly, I ordered a small Pho with beef balls. The broth was actually very good and tasted more beefy than many other pho places who just water down the good stuff. The pho however could have had a little more beef balls. Overall a good resto! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Good serving of pho, even the smaller bowl is enough. It's presented with less meat portion than most similar establishments(i.e. Pho Bang New York in Chinatown). 
To my knowledge, they are the first to offer, in the greater Montreal area, the novelty dare, the Pho Challenge. Litteraly, a bucket size bowl to be completed in a time limit."}
{"text":"Phothai is a really nice looking place to go to eat at with plenty of room to move around, modern decorations and furniture... it practically feels like a lounge!

I ordered a Pho Tonkinoise and it came in a big bowl, not their largest as I wasn't hungry enough to be part of that crazy contest this place runs. It was very good, with lots of meat and noodles... the Pho was a solid 4 stars by itself.

So, why 3 stars? I have never waited 30 minutes for a Pho soup in my life, I wasn't so sure about what was going on but for place open for lunch, this place doesn't fit the bill. There's no reason for my food taking this long particularly with the resto being mostly empty....during \"rush hour\" lunch.

This place also offers Bubble Tea, I'll be back one day, when the weather is nicer, to get me some of that!"}
