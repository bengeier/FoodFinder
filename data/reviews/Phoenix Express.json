{"text":"I love this place. The food has consistently been good. Their sushi is great too. Eat here."}
{"text":"The absolute best food around!  Sushi is spectacular and everything on the menu is delicious!  The food is cooked light and not heavy with grease very traditional, and always friendly service!"}
{"text":"Their sushi did not smell or taste good. I am so confused they their ratings are so high. My roll was sketchy and I'm not going to go back when there are so many adequate sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Really great prices for tasty and quality sushi, ready fast and fresh! It's definitely the closest I've been able to come so far to the epic sushi and Japanese cuisine available in Cali where I grew up. It really hit the spot! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sushi rolls I purchased today.  It is nice this place is close by my residence.  I had no idea until I turned to Yelp for dinner tonight.  I will return soon and will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Lost my sushi virginity to their Las Vegas roll and I'm hooked. Their Crab Rangoon is by far the best around and I have never ordered something that was not fresh and delicious. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Phoenix Express! The staff is always friendly and courteous, and extremely helpful when it comes to making decisions! Their food is amazing, but their sushi takes the cake. I drive out of my way to go here frequently just so I can have their sushi, my personal favorite is the out of control roll. I completely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes! Finally !! A good Chinese restaurant in stow! 1. It's very nice and clean. 2. It's fast. 3. The food is delicious!  Every time I visit a Chinese restaurant I would order the orange beef. For the past 5 years in Ohio I have finally found the place that can make it the best! Would defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"Large portions, quality of food was above expectations, very fresh ingredients, nice presentation, clean seating areas, friendly and helpful staff. We dined in and purchased a carry out order. Phoenix cafe is worth the trip!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Was craving sushi for awhile and lemme tell ya, this place exceeds all standards. Extremely clean, quick, polite and most importantly THEIR FOOD IS AMAZING. The best sushi I've had in a looooong time. Spend all your money here"}
{"text":"Good sushi. Tried the bourbon chicken, and general tsos and it was not the best I've ever had, but still good."}
{"text":"Great food, and the yum yum sauce is the best i've ever had. I tried the lo mein noodles, next times planning to try the pad thai!"}
{"text":"Underestimated this place by its looks. Doesn't look like the best sushi bar but was soooo yummy. Definitely great sushi."}
{"text":"I love Phoenix Express!!! There was a month where I was addicted to the sweet potato, salmon & avocado rolls. I got them every other day. :) The seating area is very nice and I love the kid who works at the register. He is sooo nice!! Sometimes they will even bring out fancy sushi rolls for you to sample."}
{"text":"Second time this has happened. After ordering on phone I was told 20 to 25 minutes. Arrived there 20 minutes later. Paid for food. Had to wait another half an hour to get my order. It looked like they rushed making the meal. Normally it's good. Not this time. I think they missed my order and then threw it together. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"First trip to Phoenix Express, good food and will definitely be back to try some other items. We ordered our food to go, inside was clean and plenty of seating. Sushi is made at the front counter so you can see the ingredients and watch it being made. Hot and sour soup and egg rolls were  yummy. Steamed chicken w/veggies comes with brown sauce that I order spicy and was great. I did not like the fried rice - it wasn't very 'fried', looked like frozen peas and carrots, too plain for me. Good California roll. Menu ranges from sushi to Chinese and hibachi, good lunch prices if you go before 3."}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming. What it lacks in ambiance it makes up for in flavor tenfold. It is very clean, staff is incredibly friendly and fast and the food is on point. We had seaweed salad, gyoza and three of their \"creative\" rolls. It was all fantastic! The only thing that would make Phoenix Express better is if they offered delivery. It would seriously DOUBLE your sales overnight."}
{"text":"Awesome, great food and great price. Best in the area. Don't expect ambience. Dinning is quick and easy, broad range offerings."}
{"text":"What nice guys! It wasn't at all what I expected and when I first went in I almost left...but I am VERY glad I didn't. The place is very blah in appearance so I was visually unimpressed. I was looking for a nice place to get a sashimi lunch plater but the menu seemed full of sushi and rolls....I'm just a big fan of the fish itself. They not only accommodated me but took the extra step to personalize my lunch and created me one of the coolest sushi items I'd ever had. The spicy sushi salad appetizer was over the top...I ordered and ate 2. I'd definitely return. He even tested some creations on me while I was there and they were wonderful. I'm glad I didn't let my \"this doesn't look like a real sushi place\" attitude turn me away."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We order take out several times a month. We usually get a sushi roll and a dinner. Our favorites are the general tso's, hibachi chicken, and the siracha roll. It is so much better than other Chinese takeout places in the area."}
{"text":"horrible hibachi food its soggy not crispy like it wasn't done on a hibachi table! veggies werent hibachi veggies (zuchini/mush/onion) and were so mushy. rice was barley fried and chicken n steak were barley browned. chinese food is good tho!"}
{"text":"Stopped tonight for dinner.  The sushi was excellent and the eggroll was crispy through all layers and very good.  Had the hibachi chicken and it was excellent.  The chicken was flavorful and tender, vegetables perfectly done and the rice was perfect.  Will definitely be back!!! And I am from Canton!"}
{"text":"Pretty impressed with the food. The sushi was made fresh and was delicious. Great prices too! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I just moved from Los Angeles to Ohio, and having lived in one of the sushi capitals for so many years, I never thought I'd find anything close to LA sushi in the Midwest. Phoenix sushi definitely holds its own, comparable to California sushi, very clean tasting fish and vegetables and delicious rolls. I'm so stoked to have found this little gem so close to home! My husband and I will absolutely be regular customers. Perfect service, friendly staff, great menu, super affordable!"}
{"text":"Great sushi in a tiny Asian restaurant?! You bet! This place is nestled in a plaza in stow where Malley's is the prominent location seen from the street. There are only a few tables inside because when I was there I noticed most people get food to go after work. 

The restaurant serves Japanese and Chinese food and they do a sushi chef on staff. I ordered 2 speciality rolls and 1 regular roll and my total was under $25! You really can't beat those prices unless you get a happy hour deal. I ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll ($5), Hawaiian Roll ($8) and the Fancy Roll ($10). I will definitely be stopping back to try more sushi rolls next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Not what you would expect from a strip mall Chinese/Sushi place in Stow, OH. Surprising! The bourbon chicken was tasty and moist. The sushi was fresh and delicious. They have a good mixture of cooked and raw sushi. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I visited Phoenix Express for the first time and I have to say, I was more than satisfied! The atmosphere was exceptional. A lot of what you would expect from an oriental based restaurant. The staff that served us was very nice, and made sure to accommodate all of our needs. I brought a 15% off of a $20 purchase coupon, and although our bill was slightly under $20, they gladly honored the coupon. The menu featured all of the oriental restaurant favorites, with a very affordable lunch menu. 
   We were seated promptly, and after our food was ordered, we waited about 10 minutes until our food was brought to us. Based on the price, and wait time, our food was outstanding. Very fresh, hot, and the portions were very generous for the price we paid. Customers pay before they are seated, which makes it very convenient if you are in a hurry or are in a limited time lunch break. 
   At the end of our meal, we were served a fortune cookie, and kindly welcomed to return. Needless to say, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered the general tso and sweet and sour chicken combo. It was excellent. The fried rice that came with it was very flavorful. Everything was seasoned well and wasn't greasy or oily like a lot of the Chinese restaurants serve. Probably the best Chinese food in Stow."}
{"text":"Great! Had they Chicken Hibachi, and Avocado rolls, 1st time there and I will go back, best around!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy but it is by no means \"express.\" Every time I come here it takes at least a half hour to get the food."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. We got our typical chinese takeout plates and were disappointed. Not to mention the prices were a few dollars more than any other Chinese place. Haven't tried the sushi yet, but really not interested after the takeout experience."}
{"text":"Need a great place for a quick lunch? Then you just found the spot. Nice sushi at a low price."}
{"text":"I am really picky about Chinese food and actually had not had Chinese for almost a year when I tried Phoenix Express. So delicious! I have had the pad Thai, sesame chicken, sweet and sour, beef and broccoli and the egg rolls. Everything has always been delicious. I can usually get 2-3 meals out of the lunch portion. The place is clean and everyone is friendly. So happy there is finally a good Chinese food option in Stow."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me!  It's good!  I like the salmon roll, wonton soup and eggroll."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi. Not the best in town, but they're quick - making it a great option for lunch or takeout."}
{"text":"Great food and it is near by.  The prices are good and the staff is fast. 
The beef and broccoli is really good and so is the orange chicken."}
{"text":"The spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll were delicious and super cheap! It was super nice and clean. It felt like a little mom and pop sushi place. I would go here everyday if it wasn't a drive for me. I'm definitely coming back again ASAP!"}
{"text":"We took carry out and although the wait was long, the Chinese food was decent - what I expected for Chinese take out.  The portions were huge, which was nice.  There's a few modest seating areas in a very open area and a decent amount of customers, but many do seem to take out.  I'd probably try sushi instead if I come back next time given other reviews."}
{"text":"Very good. The fried rice is exceptionally good. Service is good. Had the sweet and sour chicken and mango chicken. Will come back. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Yay! My husband and I used to drive 45 minutes to our favorite sushi place but it closed and we have been on the hunt for a new place. We found it! The prices were good and the sushi was fresh and delicious. We look forward to returning again very soon. They were fast and service was attentive. The restaurant was also very clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been great! When they opened, we stopped in for lunch and they gave us some free sushi to sample. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for classic Asian food or quick sushi."}
{"text":"We love phoenix express. The food is consistently excellent and it is pretty affordable. What really stands out to me is the customer service. Phoenix express has better customer service than the majority of restaurants we go to. We would rather drive 20 minutes for this food and service than go to any of the other Chinese restaurants closer to us"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Chinese/Japanese food. 

We decided upon a takeout from Phoenix Express for their sushi and they did not disappoint. We ordered the Spider-Man and Godzilla rolls( yes, in the mood for movie themed named food...) and the sushi came out better than expected. It tasted fresh and very tasty.  We also ordered the teriyaki salmon and crab Rangoon. Teri salmon was really good, and it came with fried rice (not too salty or overly seasoned to complement the salmon Teri) and stir fried veggies. Great portions for the Teri salmon, although i do think the sushi was a bit on the smaller side. Crab Rangoon was as expected and the nice thing was, they weren't overly oil logged. 

The place it self was neat, although the condiment space was a bit messy. Although I suppose they were in the process of cleaning up and we did came in a bit later in the night. 

Food came out fast and fresh with really reasonable price, especially for the hibachi/ teriyaki. We will most definitely came back again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and the only reason I can think why I haven't written a review is........ I do not know. The food is excellent . I would say, in my opinion one of the best Chinese eatery in town. 
Love the food,service and portions. Usually one portion cover my lunch and diner. Great job."}
{"text":"Love at first roll! Came here for my mom's birthday and loved all the food but the sushi is the star - Out of control roll was the perfect choice and at only $8 I got a Dynamite roll to go with it!"}
{"text":"The sushi is just ok. I order here a lot because it is near my house, it's always ready on time. I've unfortunately had a few incidents where there were tiny pieces of shrimp tail in my sushi. If you're looking for cheap and basic sushi I would go here."}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenix Express twice and both times we've had great food and fantastic service. You can't get sushi of the quality and variety without driving out of your way for it. 

When my husband and I visit, our go to is to split an order of steamed dumplings, a small maki roll, and one of their specialty rolls. I can't give specifics on my favorite roll because they've all been good. I haven't tried their hot dishes here, but they seem very popular in take out orders so I'm confident that those dishes are of the same quality. 

I've noticed that most people order take out here, but eating in is far from an unpleasant experience. They take care with presentation and, again, the service is fantastic. Phoenix Express is a great addition to the area restaurants."}
{"text":"Perfect for sushi-ists!

Easy to miss, overlook, not even know this place is here, even if you live in the area.  I don't, but if I did, they would quickly know me by face because I would be in there a lot!

Good sushi, good price, good selection.  They also have typical carry out fare of both American Japanese and American Chinese foods.

Not a place to bring a large group, but they do have a lot of call-in business and a lot of walk in/carry out business.

Again, good sushi (hmmm... Godzilla rolls..... hmmmm) at a good price.  Perfect."}
{"text":"I live twenty minutes away from PE and I pass no less than four Chinese take out places. But PE has sushi and it's KILLER. You can tell that they take it seriously and don't just throw their rolls together. If you told me their sushi was from a fine, sit down restaurant I wouldn't even bat an eye. 

And the rest of their food? It's great as well. General Tsos is crisp--not really spicy but really tasty. Their gyoza have a nice hearty dough on the outside. If it were thicker it probably would be too much but as is, great. Chicken fried rice is basic but does its job just fine. 

Nothing I've eaten here has left me dissatisfied. And being able to get great sushi with my kids sweet and sour chicken? That's a dream come true."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Portions are good and the price seems fairly competitive. We had the Beef and Broccoli, which was good. We also had the Hawaii Roll and that is outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great staff. Have eaten here several times and it has always been fresh.  Would highly recommend if you are looking for sushi or Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  Not a fancy restaurant but that doesn't affect the quality of this food.   It's always excellent"}
{"text":"Sweet potato sushi is phenomenal. Place is always clean and efficient, it's 10 times cleaner and better than most places that serve Chinese food. Check it out, you will come back."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and stopped in. First impression a little low, small and tucked into a shopping mall on Graham Road. The sushi destroyed that first impression! Lunch started with a tasty clear soup, then spicy tuna roll and spicy tuna hand roll.some of the best ever and we are sushi fanatics. Filled up with a Godzilla roll which was very good as well. We live in Atlanta, Georgia but whenever we are in the Akron area you can find us at Phoenix Express..."}
{"text":"Went here this evening with my boyfriend and a friend for the first time! Food was amazing. Sushi is very good, pricing is extremely fair as well. I had two classic rolls, and I had hibachi salmon with noodles and veggies. My food was only $20 and they really load up the plates. Our food came within 10 minutes of ordering it and it was fresh and hot. The sushi chef made the sushi and plates look really gourmet as well. Would highly recommend especially for the quality you get for the price. I'd say it's like a nice hibachi restaurant quality food for half the price and a fraction of the time. Great!"}
{"text":"We often eat out at sushi places 2-3 times a month, we decided to drive a little bit to try this place based on the reviews and i'm glad we did! This is one of those \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" places, we pulled up and immediately thought, there is no way we are going to get good sushi here...after contemplating in the parking lot for a good 5 minutes we decided we were already here we were going to try it, and boy are we glad we did! 

We each got a meal, which was portioned HUGE...if you get the hibachi chicken and vegetables you will have enough for two meals...you can share it with someone else or take it the next day for lunch there is so much. 

We got 4 sushi rolls, and each one was amazing, the las vegas roll was probably my favorite it had a little bit of each flavor and texture, but really anything you get here is going to be amazing so pick whatever your heart desires! 

The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because you have to go to the counter and order your food and drinks, they don't come out to you...for as much as we spent (84 dollars for four people) I would expect or want table service, but the food makes up for the lack thereof! 

We will definitely be back when we are in the area, and even when we aren't we may just take a drive! Try this place out, you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"When I lived in stow, this place was right down the street and I'm truly glad to have given them a chance! Everything from the sushi to the Phoenix trio meals! If your in the stow-Monroe falls area. Check em out!"}
{"text":"Stick to the Sushi... Hawaii roll was nice... would get that again.

Hubby does not eat sushi... got the General Tso's... meh!

3/4 were just fried breading with no chicken and overly sweet sauce...  ended up with less than 1 cup of actual chicken.

potstickers / gyoza were thick and tasteless

The search for a place where we will both be happy continues!"}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. Steamed dumplings are very good and so is the lo mein, both pork and beef. Crab rangoon is nice and crispy with a good creamy filling. The hibachi chicken has a nice mix of veggies and chicken with a tasty sauce. I'm not a fan of true sushi, but I like their Hawai'ian roll, the coconut shrimp is always very good. To go order took 10 minutes or less. Definitely my go to for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Everything we had was great and fast!  Clean and inviting restaurant... Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have gone here twice now and disappointed. It's like the McDonald's of hibachi. They've been rude both times and the food was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place the sushi is the best I ever had and cheap too. Clean and friendly. I recommend to all members my friends."}
{"text":"I was looking for some Chinese. Drove up not sure what to expect. The food was amazing. Cooked to perfection. Totally satisfied."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. This isn't a Benihana-like hibachi spot where they cook in front of you, but the food is incredible. The shrimp tempura is great. I haven't tried the sushi yet but I will soon, for sure. Great prices and great food!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty mad that I took so long to try Phoenix Express. I think this is the best restaurant in the Kent/Stow area, period. The sushi is great and tastes fresh. It's really clean, too, and a good spot for sit-down meals."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! The have the best general t'so chicken. They also have great sushi. I would recommend driving to stow than go anywhere in Kent. Anything you get is sure to be very tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome local business! This place is my go-to for high quality sushi. It's affordable, varied in options and always yummy!"}
{"text":"Love you he lunch special, perfectly cokked chicken and tasty garlic chickeb dish for under 6$, with fried rice! Awesome"}
{"text":"Food was very good the fish was fresh. The staff was friendly to answer any questions that we had. I brought a coworker her who has never had sushi before and he just loved it."}
{"text":"Very quick service and clean establishment. Staff was very accommodating and pleasant. Went with my toddler and ordered chicken lo mein and the volcano roll. Both were delicious. May have been the most flavorful lo mein I have ever had and the roll tasted fresh with a great combination of flavors!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great food and super fast! Love it here. Wish they took FlashCash and many student friends of mine would go more."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good for the price. Always super busy at night so call ahead!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a whim and boy am I glad we did! The sushi is delicious! Sakura has been our go to sushi spot for the last 8 years, but this is definitely just as good. The rolls are creative and fresh. The Chinese food looks really good too."}
{"text":"A step above your regular Chinese take out!
I asked Siri about an hour ago for \"A chinese restaurant near me with good ratings\" and she recommended this with an average of 4.5 stars.
Right now we are eating 2 lunch specials ($5.50 each) - one with Chicken and broccoli, and the other with Chicken Lomein. Both are served in a round take out container with white or fried rice on the side.  They are both very yummy.  I asked, and they normally use dark meat chicken for these dishes - I requested Breast Meat, and they were happy to oblige with no extra charge.  The meat is great, no fat globs or veins (if I saw one, I'd be DONE!)
The taste is so much better than the other Chinese Restaurants in the area that I have tried.  I am looking forward to going back for Sushi or hibachi.
Just a storefront in a strip mall, but definitely good food!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and I has a favorite sushi spot in ohio now:)))). Thank u for epic sushi and most of all being so nice to us when we are there:))). Will visit  u guys soon:)))"}
{"text":"If someone had told me the best sushi I'll eat in Northeast Ohio would be at a strip mall spot in Stow....I'd tell them they're crazy! But honestly, consistently the best rolls I've had in a while. So good that my son & I look for reasons to drive the 30 miles to this spot!
Highly recommended not just for the sushi but their lo-mein is really good as well. A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have ate at a lot of fast serve chinese restaurants in my life and this is one of the best I have had in awhile. Food was cooked well and the yum yum sauce is a great plus. Not only was the food delicious but the price was extremely fair, $8 for a very generous dinner plate to go. This is definitely the spot for sit in or quick take out chinese/Japanese in a 20 mile radius."}
{"text":"Cheap, Healthy and Tasty! Sushi is delicious. I tried the Godzilla and the Out of Control rolls so far. Sushi seems a little smaller than other restaurants, but it's definitely filling. I want to try the Chinese dishes, next. The place is clean and the workers are very friendly. Great prices, too."}
{"text":"Pretty good local Asian take out place. Love their different egg rolls. I've had some issues calling in and getting takeout some nights."}
{"text":"Delicious meal.  Great prices.  The shrimp tempura was amazing.  They were very kind to make a special roll for my daughter.       I had the dragon roll.  Delicious avocado roll, miso soup, low mein vegetables were huge.  

Friendly service! Super prices. Fast delivery. Very clean!  I would go there again and again and again.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! Great dishes as well and pretty affordable. Environment not that nice but it doesn't matter to me because the food is incredible."}
{"text":"The food came out quickly and was all good. The Vegas roll and fancy roll were both something I would order again! The dragon roll wasn't up to par, and wasn't finished. Li Mein and chicken was ok, nothing spectacular but the kids did eat it."}
{"text":"I'm lucky to have Phoenix Express so close to me. Pretty much everything I've tried here has been really good, especially the pad thai, red curry w/ chicken and the egg rolls. They do takeout and it's usually ready as quick as 10 minutes. You can also sit down and eat there. Probably my favorite Asian takeout in the are. Each meal lasts for dinner and lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional!! The sushi is amazing and we really like the chicken and broccoli! Love the miso soup and atmosphere when we dine in but also love to carry out!! The owners here are friendly and they know Japanese and Chinese. ...sooo glad we finally have a good sushi place in Stow!! It's about time!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.

Exceptional sushi, great service, a very friendly personable staff and great prices.

Never would I have imagined something so great housed in a strip mall in Stow, Ohio.

The first time I ever ate here I was somewhat hesitant given the location, but don't let that throw you off this place is one of my favorite sushi spots and their sushi is on par with places like Cilantro in Akron or the places I've had in Cleveland.

I used to get Phoenix almost at least weekly when I lived in Kent and tried most of their rolls and nigiri. 

I prefer the raw fish to fried rolls overall, but the Hawaii is definitely worth trying. Their nigiri sushi is great too. Honestly I've never had anything from here that I didn't think was well above average at the very least. 

The hibachi is a great quick lunch as well and the price is even better."}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenix twice now. The first time I got a sampler of a few different types of sushi and wasn't blown away. The second time I came for lunch and went with a more standard spicy tuna roll with hot & sour soup. Honestly, sticking with the no frills approach was definitely a good choice! The spicy tuna roll was one of the better ones I've ever had, which says a lot since it's my go-to sushi order. The hot & sour soup was what really knocked it out of the park for me--i expected a simple broth of some sort, but it was full of egg, strips of tofu and beef, and onion. Altogether it was $8 (compared to $13 for the aforementioned sampler) and was way more food than I expected to be eating for lunch. I'm officially sold on this place."}
{"text":"Sushi was great and the staff is very friendly.  They feature 2 new appetizers that were very good. The scallion pancakes were delicious."}
{"text":"This was really good for clean, fast American-style \"Chinese\" food:

Vegetable spring roll - fried and brimming with fresh cabbage
Miso soup - filling and enough for 2
Shrimp tempura - bland but not bad
Veg lo mein - hearty and not too salty
Thai cashew chicken & beef and broccoli - both with lots of meat and veggies, not just pools of sauce

The vegetables were fresh and plentiful in every dish.  The meats were also tender and generously portioned.  Even the steamed rice was moist. You get a lot for your value.  The serve it up fast and keep it warm for a long time.  Looking forward to lunching on leftovers all week."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife for sit down Chinese food ( this is a take out place).

Had beef with broccoli and wanton soup.  MW wife had yellow curry.  Her hot and sour was superb.  The best she's had!!

The wanton was the best I've had which s  quite a statement coming from me as I worked in China 4 years.  Beef broccoli wasvexcellent. Fresh and flavorful a light sauce refreshing.  Yellow curry misses coconut milk of Thai food.  

We will e back. This is great food great value"}
{"text":"Very very good! Very very quick! Went for the lunch special and will return!  In a nice shopping district. Friendly staff. Clean.  Made to order.  You just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"By far the best take out chinese place around here. Always gets our order right and prices are right! Their rolls are always wrapped good and fresh. You can order the food low sodium and gluten free which is great for dieters. Nor I or anyone else I know has gotten sick here and I think it's a great place for chinese."}
{"text":"Really loved the food, and prices.  Everything we tried we liked, but if you want spicy you have to ask for it.  Their regular spicy is not at all spicy!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with a great choice of fresh and delicious sushi! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What a very nice find. We were driving home after running errands in the Akron area. Everyone wanted sushi so we looked for the closest place with good reviews. This place was on the top so we stopped by. It is in a strip plaza. It was empty when we went in, and while we ate in, it became obvious that this place mainly does take out. A lot of people came in just to pick up their orders and run,but  we ate in. You order at the counter when you first walk in, then grab a table. The staff is very friendly and so helpful with ordering.  It isn't a fancy place. It looks like it may have been an old subway or something similar based on the inside. But it was perfectly clean. The food came out quickly and was extremely hot! The sushi was some of the best that I have had and rivals more upscale establishments.  You can tell that it is locally owned, they make sure everything is the way you like it. I would check them out if you are in the mood for sushi!"}
{"text":"Since I've been burned on sushi at so many places, I refuse to order. Tried from their normal food fare. 

General Tso's was okay, nothing to write home about. But the lo mein was terrible."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The chicken fried rice was the best I've ever had, it was so fresh.  The spring rolls were also the best I've ever had, and the chicken lo mein was pretty good too.  The atmosphere was pleasant, and the food quality and speed at which we got it was pretty much perfect.  I will definitely be returning here, since this was the best Asian food that I have ever had.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise! Sushi and delicious dishes with great prices! Clean and bright inside- a great addition to the plaza!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and decent variety of standard Chinese dishes. Mostly oriented towards takeout, but they can seat about 25 people in a no-frills dining area. The quality of food makes it up for it though. The lifesaver roll is to die for, lots of flavor, with a great cilantro-lime touch."}
{"text":"Great Chinese place! They have actual fried rice and not the yellow fried rice. I would recommend the chicken and broccoli and fried rice!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh sushi. Very clean restaurant. At first glance it looked like a stereotypical Chinese spot but indeed it did had more style. The friendly service was excellent. The prices were very very fair. I had the Out of Control Roll, the Godzilla Roll, tuna sashimi and crab Rangoon. For the price and the service and the taste, unless you're the type that has a stick up your nose- go! Go! Go!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is it's about damn time Stow finally has a REALLY good Asian themed restaurant in the area!!! For just $2.00 I got a giant bowl of won ton soup (enough to share, easily) which trumps everyone else. The broth was delicious on it's own but the meat inside tasted fresh & had a slight hint of soy sauce that was lick your bowl clean awesomeness! I also tried the clear soup broth, it offered a surprisingly good smokiness that I have yet to taste elsewhere. 
This was followed by the coconut chicken- although it was not exactly what I had expected it was NOT a disappointment. Each bite was tender & juicy, the sauce was prepared just right (not too thick or overpowering nor bland like other places). It too was another large portion, for just $10.00 it could easily feed two people. It also came with steamed rice and veggies. 
My husband ordered three different types of sushi and was smiling ear to ear. Our server, who was attentive, polite and adorable- even offered Chris a new sushi roll (for free) that might be on the menu in the near future. He is not a fan of cooked sushi but said the combination of spicy tuna, salmon & cucumber with two different types of sauces was better than any other restaurants cooked sushi! 

I can't wait to go back & try the sweet & sour chicken!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good. Great pricing. Excellent service. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"This is great food! They make it unbelievably quick to order and you get your moneys worth! Servings are huge. I have dined in a couple of times and it is quite small. Especially in the winter when there is a draft when the door opens anywhere you sit but I look past it for the great quality of food. They are extremely friendly and I love going there."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant- love that you can get clear soup, sushi, and green salads!"}
{"text":"Stow's best kept secret! The Wonton soup is amazing and the sushi can't be beat. Great pricing and friendly service! The restaurant was so clean too! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious. The staff was attentive. The green tea ice cream was a refreshing finish."}
{"text":"Great hibachi meals at a very reasonable price. We frequent this place and have enjoyed every meal that we've tried."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest place for sushi, but for being in Stow, this sushi is amazing!!  We've been missing out on this place for the 10 years we've lived here! We had the Spider-Man, Sea Angel, and a Life Saver roll (which is one of the best flavor combos I've ever had in Sushi -lemon, cilantro and Jalepeno!!) 

You've gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend sampling anything on the menu. I've been to the Phoenix Express more than a dozen times now and only taken out once; however, no difference in the quality of food or service. 

By far this has been the best Chinese cuisine that I've enjoyed in the area, I was pleasantly surprised with their sushi selection and like that it's fresh, tasty and reasonable. It's a no frill restaurant environment and I'm Ok with that because it clean and their emphasis is on the quality food and service.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi nice little place good Thai food. Tuna roll check. Out of Control roll ditto. Wife liked her Thai curried noodles. Low prices. Basically a sure thing."}
