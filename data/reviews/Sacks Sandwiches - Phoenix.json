{"text":"Although part of small chain in the Phoenix area, Sacks does have a distinctively local feel. The interior is basic and functional, without a lot of fuss. Sandwich and deli board contain an interesting array of possibilities, and while there are vegetarian options, some may find the selection a bit limited. The prices are reasonable, the food is good, the service is friendly, so go for it. It's a break from the ordinary; i.e., Jimmy Johns, Subway etc."}
{"text":"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my \"go to place\" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Tim ordered a Sacks' Jazz and I ordered the Sacks' Overture. The price was good for the food we got. Tim was excited the sanwiches came with a cookie.   The Overture was tasty, filling, and just enough horseradish sauce to my my sinuses flate. The food was fresh and good.  Tim says his Jazz is real good. He kept talking it uo.  The service we was friendly and quick.  For the price and quality of the food I would recommend it for your deli needs."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch with my son and didn't realize that they closed @ 3 pm and the door was locked, but they saw us and opened the door and were glad to take our order. The sandwiches were delicious, can't wait to try this place again. Really appreciate the great customer service , that is something that you don't see too much of anymore."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  The signature \"Improv\" is like Thanksgiving on a sandwich..."}
{"text":"Good, unique sandwiches at reasonable prices. I had the Improv, which is like cold Thanksgiving dinner on a baguette: turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, lettuce, mayo. The little cookies that come with the sandwiches are fantastic, too. Yes, the sandwiches are pretty stuffed and the fillings often fall out, but better that then an underfilled sandwich that's all bread, like Subway, right?!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches I had the sac o keief it was very well made the prices were reasonable nice friendly atmosphere. Worker seemed very happy. My choice for a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"So yummy! I just created my own sandwich and it was fantastic. The bread was soft and every ingredient was completely on point. I will be ordering more in the future."}
{"text":"Sacks is awesome! So many different choices for sandwiches, teas, sides, and chips! The people are very nice and they even made me lunch after they had closed one day (I was pregnant) they were so sweet and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Soggy Sandwich  I ordered the Sacks Improv. The stuffing was beyond mushy. The lettuce was soaked and way too much of it. The sandwich was a sad, soggy, bland disappointment. The enjoyable part of the lunch was the surprise cookie. I might be persuaded to try it again but will definitely get something else."}
{"text":"We've only ordered from them twice, both times our order was wrong. Sandwiches aren't good enough to give them a third shot. Ladybug House of Sandwiches is way better, they deliver, and your order is always right ;)"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge, and always very good. I like Ruben and the improv (Turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce on a baguette). I love the oriental sesame noodles as well. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"I I would really like this place had they not treated me like crap!! And I will def. not spend money on a place where people do not appreciate it. Even if it is only $10 I am spending.   I requested the pasta renaissance and explained that I'm a vegetarian and that the sauce needs to be the one not being soaked with meatballs.  Well the chick behind the counter says'' if you 're a vegetarian you need to  order something else''  it took a lot out of me to not say really mean things.   I have requested this before with no problems, so I am not sure what happened that day, but regardless I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Sack's twice, and twice they've screwed up my order. I will not be giving them a chance to do it a third time. How do you mistake egg salad for turkey? It wasn't even busy in there. Never again."}
{"text":"I really want to give them 2.5. The food is.....good. They have variety (hot and cold specials) and reliable execution in sandwich making. The poor pickle spears are smothered in aluminum foil and kept in the fridge too long. A cookie comes with every order, random, not home made, but a plus. The atmosphere and decor leave much to be desired. Way too many tables crammed into the eating space (with no designated employee to clean said tables) The place is also decorated like a free trade coffee house. Ram and antelope skeletons adorn the walls with woven baskets, skins, and spears.........what is the connection to a sandwich shop?? That still uses styrofoam cups? If you want an 'okay' sandwich and forgettable atmosphere, go to Sack's!!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here while visiting the hospital across the street.  I followed the recommendation of my colleague and had the smoked salmon sandwich.  To be honest, it was all rather disappointing from the break (not much taste and not the freshest) to the salmon which lacked seasoning.  I know it is hard to make a sandwich memorable, but I expect a relative minimum quality which unfortunately wasnt met."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sandwiches, among the best I have ever had anywhere in the country (inclusive of New York, Boston, Philly).  My favorites are the O'keefe and the Jazz. The pastrami is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I have come to Sacks over the years originally out of convenience. However,once I tried their sandwiches I was hooked and am a forever customer. I would tend to go once in a while, but recently have found myself going at least once per week. I have forgotten to write a Yelp review over the years, but this week I had the best sandwich ever, and swore to myself I would report it to Yelpers everywhere.  I believe it was called the Avalon, and it was a daily special. It was a cold tuna sandwich, which does not sound special at all, but it was AMAZING! Their tuna salad alone is delicious, but this sandwich had a smear of flavorful mustard, Havarti cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and I added red onions. The portion was big enough for two meals and you have to love the free Sacks cookies that comes in the bag! The Remmington is another sandwich I highly recommend, but you really cannot go wrong at Sacks. I especially love any of their hot chicken sandwiches.  Thank you, Sacks, for putting a gourmet spin on sandwiches, for the clean environment, for the great customer service, for the daily specials, and most importantly: for the prompt service! The food comes out in a flash, even when they are busy."}
{"text":"Needed a fix and hadn't had a Sacks sandwich in a few months. It was delish and reminded me why I love their food. Today, I had a simple chicken salad sandwich with lettuce, cucumbers and provolone. Of course, I had to get an iced tea and one of their snikerdoodle cookies. I also like to get the Symphony sandwich - turkey, bacon, sprouts and cream cheese (I 86 the tomato and guac.); or the grilled cheese with a choice of cheeses; and a few friends regularly crave the Dali - egg salad.   The location on Thomas is always packed at lunch - it's really popular with the docs and nurses from St. Joseph's Hospital. Get there by 11:30 or wait until 1; or order over the phone and have it delivered (minimum 4 orders). If you do call in an order, make sure you know which of the four stores you're calling and don't forget that they're only open until 2."}
{"text":"What a find!  I got a half sandwich and it came with a little fresh chocolate chip cookie!  They are a family owned business.  I'm new to phoenix- so glad to have found this lunch place"}
{"text":"Note: this review has 2 part (initial frustration & the follow up)   When i called to change an order I faxed in, right before i hang up, i hear \"GD pain in my A$$\"   I'm sorry but, when is OK to swear at the customer who has been providing you business for 3 years, with a large order around a hundred dollars every month!!   ---------7 hours later---------------------------   So as a follow up to my initial frustrations, the owner of Sacks called me to ask about my experience some 7 hours later.  He wants to keep my business and it making it up to my business. OK maybe money wont buy you happiness or a perfect review but someone wanting to keep me happy is a business I'm willing to give a second chance."}
{"text":"If I could eat the Encore with hot peppers and feta yogurt sauce every day, I would.  If you're in the area, there's no reason to go anywhere else for a sandwich.  They also have awesome chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"DELISH. Haven't had a bad sandwich there yet. And the yummy cookies.. Yum. C Is for cookie because I don't have enough verbiage to post this yet."}
{"text":"Bread good, lots of options for veggies and portions are a good size. They also have a good selection of chips. Some brands I've never seen before. And as an added bonus they give you a free chocolate chip cookie which was also really good."}
{"text":"Really good lunch spot with enough parking and a good light lunch spot.  Sandwiches are unique but have amazing flavor. Would definitely recommend as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and had one of the best sandwich experiences ever. Had the Palm Beach (special) and was impressed with the speed and organization of the staff. This is a tightly run ship and when I have mere minutes for lunch, I respect the hell outta that."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I visit Sacks on occasion, but for take-out only. Every time we go in (lunch time during the week), it is totally mobbed. We walk in, wait in line, order, pay, get our bags and leave. Sacks is great when you are placing a large order for a group of people because everyone gets their own sack (hee-hee, get it, sack at Sacks). The other fabulous thing about Sacks is you get a scrumptious, warm chocolate chip cookie with your sandwich.  Today I had the Improv, which is a baguette with turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, lettuce and mayo. The next time I get it, I will ask for no lettuce or mayo. I felt like the turkey to stuffing ratio was way off too - I was biting into lots of stuffing and no turkey.   Another favorite of mine is the Symphony-yummy turkey with bacon and sprouts and cream cheese ... Next time!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place for lunch.   I had the prime rib, With marinara.  Really good and lots of other great sandwiches to go back for.  Cookies were delicious. Cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was craving a sandwich. And I always pass this place and have never been in... I'm very happy I stopped! As I was getting out of my car there was a lady walking out who put on the \"closed\" sign. :( my luck it was 3:58pm and they close at 4pm. I was bummed! As I was about to walk away feeling defeated by the sandwich gods this nice man came out and said \"Hey I can make you a sandwich to go really fast\" I was hesitant because I know what a pain in the butt it is when someone strolls in right as you about to close up shop, but he assured me that everything still needed to be put away so it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered the Sacks Symphony which seemed to be the easiest thing to make just to be sure I wasn't being too big of a jerk. The cook made it up in a jiffy I cashed out with the sandwich and a bag of chip for about 8$ and I was on my way.  The sandwich was HUGE! As least for me it was. The sandwich had delicious crispy bacon, fresh avocado, sprouts and tomatoes along with cream cheese and savory turkey.  It was delicious and SOOO FRESH!   My favorite part was the awesome cookie that comes with every meal! Sold!  Ill be back soon! Very soon! Great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"The Bad: 1. Weirdly laid out dining room with messy tables. 2. Service is usually lousy. 3. Abundance of hard surfaces makes dining inside a noisy ordeal. Woven wall hangings are our friends!  The Good: 1. The Dali sandwich, with gooey egg salad and thick bacon, is to die for. 2. Mini chocolate chip cookies are a wonderful bonus. 3. One of the few local eateries that serves fountain Diet Sprite. 4. Across the street from St. Josephs, so one sees a lot of cute nurses in their scrubs coming in and out."}
{"text":"Found this place back in 2005ish  I really like the sandwiches and the different options. Also you get a cookie with each samich.  I would recommend to everyone to come and try it.  I like the Gothic sandwich, i usually get the same one but i go for a different one every other time.  Friendly staff and fast."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming for many years and recently stopped by for their italian sub.  Still as good as ever, these guys have great quality produce and a simple but yet complex style in their sandwiches. Little details make me appreciate them, ohh yeah and they have good tea."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. This place is so good.  I love their tuna on 12 grain bread so much that I always want to get something else and end up ordering it anyway.    That being said, when I do venture off of the usual fare, their daily specials are AWESOME.  Whether a new salad, hot sandwich, or cold sandwich, I've never been disappointed by the combos they put together on that specials menu.   One of my favorite sandwich places since I was like 10 years old. :)"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very good, but for whatever reason this location allways screws up my order! They forget to put it in or forget to call my name and it takes 25 min to get my food. That being said the encore is very good, just be prepared to wait a while"}
{"text":"Chocolate cookies to die for included with your sandwich. It may take you a little bit to order, every sandwich has witty names and there's a lot of options."}
{"text":"My go-to is the Improv, a Thanksgiving-type sandwich with sliced turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and shredded lettuce. The only sandwich place that might beat Sacks in Phoenix is Even Stevens. I wouldn't bother with McGurkee's or Cheba Hut. Sacks Sandwiches are well thought out and satisfying."}
{"text":"First time here and it was fantastic!! I loved the Ruben! Plus they have RC Cola on tap!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch during a visit to a local office. They have a great sandwich selection for such a great price.   I opted to get their turkey sandwich with gluten free bread and chicken tortilla soup. It took a few to get my order but they were busy.   Soup- a thick and flavorful soup. I've had better but non the less it hit the spot. I wish it had more chicken though.   Turkey sandwich- the turkey sandwich was solid but the gluten free bread----- yum!!!!!! I don't know if they make their own bread but wherever they get that bread, I would sure want to know. It was the fluffiest and most delicious gluten free bread I've ever had. The flavor and texture was so good I forgot it was gluten free.   Love the service as it felt like one of your uncles was behind the register taking your order. I will definitely be back to this place next time I'm in our local office."}
{"text":"Terrific sandwiches all the way around! One thing they need to fix is their signage - they need to trim or move the palm tree that is covering their sign. The parking is super-tight from 11:15AM to about 1:00PM. Ditto to the other reviews: call your order in 20 mins before you need to go pick it up during the lunch rush.  There is a wide variety of iced teas, fountain drinks and chips to choose from. They have a punch card you can get so after so many sandwiches you get one free. Solid!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have never had a bad meal here. I typically get tuna on wheat with rotelle pasta on the side, but love their hot sandwiches just as much. Staff is always friendly and service is fast. They only lose one star because they wont deliver orders under $20.  If you need a quick, satisfying, reasonably priced lunch, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a big fan of sandwich places, I must say that this one is a really good place to have lunch, whether light or substantial. I'm glad Rand H. invited me to try this place with him. There's a good array of sandwiches, salads, and sides to choose from, and the place itself has a relaxed and informal atmosphere. The sandwich I ordered - the \"Encore\" - was delicious: steak, provolone, sauteed onions, peppers, lettuce, and yogurt dressing, in a baguette. It was a good size; I thought I'd bring half home but ended up eating the entire thing. The Oriental Noodle Salad, their version of cold sesame noodles, was also good; I managed to finish it even after I had consumed the large sandwich I had ordered. Good to know another pleasant place to have a leisurely meal with friends in the heart of the city."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Plenty of already-thought-out sandwich options plus the ability to make your own. Always fresh and delicious. Favorite is the Van Gogh, add tomatoes and a little mayo (and I normally don't like mayo).  Once my call in order was wrong and they gave me a free side for the wait, but the wait was still faster than even a drive through at a fast food place!  Tip: Call in and pick up faster than everyone else.  PS free mini chocolate chip cookie with each sandwich ordered."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my sandwich the service was fast and really conveniently close to the hospital, walking distance. Would come back if I ever have to visit with his"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. But if you do not order ahead, plan on a wait and a hard time parking.  With the hospital across the street, it is a very popular place.  If you can order ahead or go at an off time, you will be so happy.  I very rarely switch up my order, but everything I've had I like.  I usually get the Encore (hot roast beef with peppers and feta sauce).  It is a little bit of heaven on a roll."}
{"text":"The key to Sack's is the daily specials.   For a long time I came here and got the Symphony which is a decent turkey/avacado sandwich and some oriental noodles or one of their other eclectic, tasty sides. Or I would get one of the hot sandwiches on a sub roll like the Encore sans ham. The sandwiches here are ok, but kindof of soggy and sloppy with only mediocre bread like the Baggin's chain in Tucson.  One of my workmate's finally showed me the light in the form of the poorly written scribbles on the white board at the far side of the menu. Pretty much everything I've ordered from it has been fantastic. The bread still isn't much to talk about, but the unique sandwiches it sports like \"The Blues\", which is some delicious cajun chicken concoction, make me wish I could eat two.  Top it off with some of their great iced teas. They usually have a couple flavors, with the fruity/citrusy ones being the best. Make sure not to pour a full cup of the Market Spice tea though, you might choke to death. It's best mixed with other teas."}
{"text":"Not being a meat eater it is hard to find a good sandwich place, but Sacks Impressionist (Veggie) is one of my favorites. It comes fully loaded and with lots of options. And if i'm feeling a little fishy, both their tuna salad and tuna sandwich are other go to items. I am usually pretty picky about my tuna, but Sacks is fresh and not smothered in mayonnaise.   This is a great spot to call in a pick up lunch on the go."}
{"text":"Um, it's ok. I despised the bread my sandwich came on but other than that I can't really complain. It's usually quite packed at lunch but yet possible to get a seat. One thing that's particularly amazing about it is the number of hot women who work and eat there. More than any culinary splendor, it's a feast for the eyes."}
{"text":"the greatest thing about Sacks... is that if you say it too quickly it sounds like you are going to have a nooner for lunch... not to a great lil sandwhich place...  i go here alot of lunch and am a big fan.  i like the fact that they actually do serve everything in a sack.  they are very quick (even with the pasta).  in each sack they have a cookie that makes the meal.  the only down fall of this place is that it fills in quick and the line gets pretty long... while the line is pretty quick seating can be a problem."}
{"text":"Seriously... It's just a sandwich people. You can dress up bread as much as you want but if you don't do it right, don't brag about it. I've had WAY better. Two stars because they gave me a cookie."}
{"text":"Great Lunch Spot! Seriously if your downtown and in the mood for a sandwich you should hit up sacks. They really have turned sandwich making into an art. There salads are delicious as well."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sandwich place when I'm at work. I only get two things because I'm a vegetarian and although they have different kinds of yummy breads, unfortunately I can't have them anymore because I'm now gluten-free. However, they have a gluten-free bun for years now, YAY! I can have sandwiches that I don't have to make at home.  The Impressionist (vegetarian) and customized egg salad sandwich are yummy. Except, the egg salad should have more mayonnaise because it's pretty dry. Also, try the pasta sides, they're yummy - I wish I could still eat them. Oh, and their apple pie cheesecake! Holy smokes, it's so good it's a sin. They don't have it all the time, but when they do, I cave in and forget that I'm gluten-free. Anyway, make sure you get their punch card to work towards a free meal."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I used to work right next to Sacks and when I discovered it, I was completely hooked. As an avid sandwich eater I am always looking for good sandwiches and Sacks it at the top ten of my list. Their sandwiches are just amazing and have the best taste to them. Their great selections of always fresh ingredients and different types of bread is the best part. I usually get the baguette because it's simply delicious topped with grilled chicken, melted provolone cheese, and fresh spinach. As simple as that sounds, it just melts in your mouth. Very yummy and a must try!!"}
{"text":"Service gets a C, not ver personable..  Food was good very good portion.."}
{"text":"Sacks symphony was my first bite here and I had to go back. My second visit I took someone I knew would split their sandwich. We had O'keefe and the Encore both delicious. The Encore was stuffed (more meat) far more than the O'keefe but both flavorful. I will def be back to try other sandwiches. Side note the service was great guy taking orders knew the menu well including the sweet treats that will call out your name when you pass them by. Get a cookie or a bar, delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Sacks! It's near my work and I come by frequently for lunch. Everything I've tried is fantastic! Favorites include the Remington, the pulled pork on a pretzel bun, Caesar salad with Cajun chicken and I can't leave without an overload cookie! Best place for sandwiches! Fresh bread. Delicious ingredients. Relatively fast. Always friendly."}
{"text":"5 Stars for a Sandwich joint.  I had lunch today at Sacks.  After fighting with the infernally packed parking lot, I entered the restaurant and encountered a lunch line extending to the door.  But no matter, as I have been there enough to know that they will speed through order-gathering, and before long a delicious creation will be my lunch.  Sacks Art of Sandwicherie is a local business with- you guessed it!- sandwiches.  They are freshly prepared and always great.  I ALMOST always order a Symphony, which consists of the best multi-grain bread,, turkey breast, bacon, avocado, tomato, alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese and mayo.  I always order mine sans sprouts, add lettuce.    But today, I vowed to try something different.    That something different was the Rio Bravo, a hot crispy, flavorful sublime experience.  This particular sandwich consists of Sautéed Chicken Breast,  Bacon,  Cheddar, Cheese, Fresh Grilled Red Onion & Jalapenos, Avocado, Tomato, Lettuce,   Sacks Chipotle Mayo,  Grilled Sourdough Bread.  WOW was this good!  They have great iced tea also, and plenty of options for the dieters, vegetarians, low fat, low carb, low glycemic, belly fats, you name it, you can still eat there!   (review based upon visit 1/18.)"}
{"text":"If you're craving a great sandwich look no further.  Today, my lunch companion and I were were looking for a tasty and quick sandwich and Sacks Art of Sandwicherie definitely fit the bill.   Sacks offers a variety of sandwichs, salads, and soups. You can even  create your own sandwich, from a long list of fresh ingredients.  In addition, to Sak's large menu, Sak's offers daily specials: usually a cold sandwich, hot sandwich, salad, and a soup.   After placing your order at the register, find a table, and wait for your name to be called. On this visit I had the Sacks Improv, loaded with Turkey breast, herb stuffing, cranberry sauce, lettuce, mayo, on an 8 inch baguette. My lunch companion created her own chicken salad sandwich. Both sandwiches were delicious.   Sak's doesn't skip on the good stuff . The balance of meat, veggies, and condiments is perfect. These sandwiches are stuffed edge-to-edge with delicious ingredients. We were pleasantly surprised to learn a small cookie came with each of the sandwiches and this chocolate chip cookie was one of the best I've ever had. A perfect ending to a great lunch.  If you're ever in the area looking for a great lunch you have to stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! I get the Remington every time - it's so good! These guys definitely know how make a sandwich the right way! Plenty of toppings that go from crust to crust and a huge variety of sandwich combinations! Oh yeah and you gotta love the little cookie that comes with!"}
{"text":"We came across this place on accident. The only thing I would change about it is the hours. The sandwich options are out of control and the sizes are huge.  I've been wanting to go back to Sacks, since we left, but can't manage to fit it in with the hours. Go after the lunch rush. Try the chicken salad. Add bacon. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the Jazz gluten free style, also turned my sister onto the Jazz, this is what she said about the Jazz... \"bread = fresh    bacon = salty    L&T = crispy    cream cheese = BONUS!! really good all together\""}
{"text":"There are too many wonderful things to say about this place. For starters, they have DELICIOUS sandwiches and soups. My favorite sandwich is \"Sacks Improv\" which has turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, lettuce, and mayo on a baguette. It is literally Thanksgiving in your mouth and is AMAZING. Second, their prices are more than reasonable and their portions are large! You will not leave this place hungry! Third, they have a variety of tea to select from with large to-go drink containers. This is great if you're going back to work (like me). Fourth, their cookies are gooey, soft and delicious. I'm not a big fan of sweets, but these are incredible. Next time, I will be going for their cheesecake! Lastly, the employees are super friendly and parking is never an issue. I cannot say enough good things about this place! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Today I called to order some sandwiches to go and the very nice gentleman on the phone said they were closed.  On the website it said they were open until 4 but he said they closed at 3 (it was a little after 3).  He said I could order sandwiches because he was still there cleaning.  I got there close to 3:30 and he stayed late for me.  The sandwiches were delicious and I have to say I thought that was sooooooooo nice of him.  I'm sure he would have liked to go home on a Saturday afternoon.  I should have gotten his name but I didn't.  Anyway, he made my day :-)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious, the food is great, parking sucks, but the cookies make up for it.  Good place to grab a quick bite. The tea is good here too."}
{"text":"Sacks never misses.  Their daily special whether the sandwich hot or cold, salad, or soup are always spot on.  Usually on Friday they feature the Kona Club, this is a CAN\"T miss sandwich(just be sure to get the sauce on the side, if getting to go!!)"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by my lunch at Sacks today. It reminded me of a place in Albuquerque called Baggins... but they fell way short on customer service and quality.   While the patio was pretty full, there was no line and I was able to walk right up to the counter to order. No greeting. She took my order, no explanation. Although, I prompted by saying, \"This is my first time here.\" Counterworker just stared blankly until I asked, \"So do I wait here or do you call my name?\"   The sandwich was fine: egg salad, cream cheese and bacon on multigrain bread. Not the best I've ever had. I ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward. It was hard as a rock! I didn't even finish the shard that I bit off.   I don't see any real reason to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I love this place because it's only a couple of blocks from my work, and because I kind of have to love it if I want to fit in here ;)   I always, always, ALWAYS get the Sacks Symphony, because the one time I didn't I had mad-food envy.    This place is just great.  Delicious LARGE sandwiches (you can totally save half... or eat it guilt free because it's so good), AND a mini cookie!  How great is that?  Seriously?  Plus, everything appears to be made to order (except for the most popular sandwiches at lunch time, and even then they never sit for long...!) and they have no problem customizing for me.  Only cons (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars) is that there's definitely not enough seating for those busy lunch hours.  And it does get a bit pricey for sandwich, chips, and drink.  But Sacks, you're worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent Food.. Great Service...Perfect Food Portion.. & Free Cookie :) (What else we need??) \"Chipotle Chicken Sandwich\" is my favorite @ SACKS. Don't miss to try this place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is just not good. I've visited twice, as I wanted to give Sacks one more chance, and was more disappointed the second visit than with the first!   First visit- my turkey sandwich ended up being almost $10! Super expensive! And, I ordered it on a baguette, thinking it would be a firm bread but instead, it was served on a super soft sub roll that became extremely soggy. I almost had to eat my turkey sandwich with a fork!   Second visit- the place smelled awful, very musty and just not appealing at all. I decided to order a different sandwich on sourdough, for a sturdier bread. The ingredients are just sub-par for the price they charge, in my opinion! AND, I went up to the counter after waiting for 20 minutes to ask how much longer and the guy just handed me the bag, that was sitting in the to-go section, and didn't apologize, even after I said I had ordered 20 min prior. I also interrupted him texting on his cell phone. My bad...  All in all, the small chocolate chip cookie is the most delicious item I was served here. I really want to like Sacks, as it's very close to work and I really love sandwiches but this is unfortunately not a place I will be returning to."}
{"text":"I've been thrice for lunch as I work nearby.  First time...with a friend. The Van Gogh. YUM!! The sprouts add a nice crisp crunch. Great bread and how can one go wrong with lean roast beef and havarti. I got a side of the asian noodles too, but they were on the dry side and a bit bland unfortunately.  Second time just popped in for tomato basil soup. YUM! Piping hot, nice portion and very robust.  Just last week the Encore. A hot sandwich. Your choice of red sauce or a feta yogurt sauce. I opted for the feta sauce. OMG what a great sandwich! The roll was awesome. The meat was tender. Sauteed onions, hot peppers, lettuce and melted provolone. Such a great sandwich!   Encore! Encore!!  Lunch is busy, so be prepared or call ahead. Trust me...it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"OK, I'm an East Coast guy where getting a good sandwich is not really a challenge. However, the corner deli is just an urban legend out here. That being said, I've been on a long quest to find some good sandwiches.   Sacks is one of the better ones which I can't believe I never even knew existed until I started working across the street from the Thomas Rd locale. Even though there always a crowd (we go at 11:30 to avoid that but there is still a heavy volume), they get your order processed quickly, the sandwiches are healthy and they have a good choice of iced teas (Go Mango!)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great service. We got two customized sandwiches and some cookies and it was all good and I'm picky when judging food so it's saying something. Just try it."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch yesterday and wanted something quick and inexpensive. That's exactly what you get here. The parking lot is small and limited so it might be a pain during the week. I ordered the Sacks Symphony and hubby ordered the Sacks Jazz with chips.   When we got our lunch bag, it included a chocolate chip cookie! Nice! I enjoyed my sandwich even though it wasn't toasted. Hubby's sandwich was a little dry and lacked flavor. I gave him a part of mine that he enjoyed much better. The cookie was a nice sweet ending to my lunch. For the both of us, I think our bill was less than $15."}
{"text":"SACKS should be called, \"Have a yummy sandwich and surprise! There's a cookie too!\" During lunch its filled with downtown Corporate America and our brains of the world from St. Joe's Hospital - its right across the street.  Look at this line!! Holy shit! Calm down! The order board is gynormous, so you'll know what you want as soon as you reach the register.  Well you better anyways. First timers, its kinda overwhelming. Take a deep breath, its just a sandwich.   Parking and seating might be an issue. Luck was on my side today. I might just hit the Casino now.... or take a nap."}
{"text":"this was my first visit. there were a variety of items on the menu. you could order from a selection of sandwiches, which seemed fairly priced at $5.50-$7-ish or create your own ... but for the create your own,  you got charged for every little thing, including 45 cents for each veggie, which seemed a bit odd. you could easily create a $9 or $10 sandwich, without a side or a drink. there were lots of sides including  pasta salad, chips, asian noodles, and some yummy, homemade desserts. it was a bit chilly so soup was in order. i had the sonoran rojo clam chowder, which was not at all what i was expecting. the broth was very thin, not thick like clam chowder normally is. there was a plethora of vegetables and huge chunks of potato and a minimal amount of rubbery clams. it looked more like vegetable soup than any chowder i've ever had. i also ordered a side of asian noodles, which appeared to be angel hair pasta, some sesame seeds and a very artificial asian marinade. i got a free chocolate chip cookie, which was small and hard, but free so can i really complain? both items i ordered were odd. the soup was better than the noodles. maybe i ordered the wrong items? counter service was simply unfriendly. i wasn't impressed, but i'd like to like this place. i'll probably try it one more time, ordering a sandwich, when i'm in the area, very hungry, and in the mood to spend $10 or $15 on lunch."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are really good...been here twice and the first time had the \"gothic\" and the second time i had \"monte cristo\". The service however is crap! The lady kept cutting me off and if i asked a question about a sandwich she gave me this attitude as if I was getting my food for free! That why I only gave it 3 stars...they definitely need to work on their people skills!"}
{"text":"Avoid the hospital lunch rush from 11:30 TO 1:30 and you'll din eon the one the finer casual sandwiches in the valley. Consistently high quality ingredients, healthy portions, albeit the accompanying cookie has always disappointed. Where's the chocolate in it? Great veggie options, as well as cold and hot warm meat based options. I love the vegetarian, as well as the Reuben, and turkey done Thanksgiving style. All meals have 'artiste' names, which loses its novelty quickly, but at least the place has attempted a viable theme.  BEWARE: staff can be snarly during lunch rush. Best to eat at 11 or 2."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon a picture of their sandwiches on instagram and you can bet your butts I was over at their location within the next hour craving for one! Being a vegetarian, this place had the PERFECT veggie sandwich; it literally had ALL of my favorites all in one! Not to mention, the sandwich was HUGE that I could not take a whole bite- it was such a beautiful experience. My happiness exploded as I took my first bite of this sandwich; it bursted with flavor. To make my day even better, it came with the most delicious chocolate chip cookie and it was so good that I ended up ordering another cookie! You'll definitely be seeing me again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy during lunch but the sandwiches are so loaded with stuff and so delicious with great combinations. Although it is crowded the food is made pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Any place that names their specialty sandwich \"The Clint Eastwood\" gets 5 stars by me:) Very Delicious. I foresee myself getting a sandwich a week until I try them all."}
{"text":"Great Sandwich shop.  Large sandwiches, quality ingredients, and reasonable priced.  I usually order the Egg Salad (w/o the cream cheese...makes it too heavy) or the BLT.  I love the little cookie treat you also get in you sack.   If you aren't planning to eat there, I recommend calling in your order.  they have a separate counter to get in and out faster."}
{"text":"i host many luncheons at different businesses around the downtown phoenix area. sometimes i deal with last minute requests and this place is a lifesaver.orders of 20, 30,or even more people have been delivered in about an hour. many of my clients now request sacks from a number of different choices.thanks for helping me out."}
{"text":"Let me be frank: I love Sacks. I love their sandwiches so much; I would drive a crazy distance to endure lunch time traffic and terrible parking just to have one of their delicious sandwiches. When I come to this location, I always feel like I'm going off to battle and will return victorious. I usually call ahead, since the line to order can be out the door. My favorite sandwich is the Symphony - minus the sprouts.  I also love that it comes with a cookie - yum. This is one of my favorite lunch time destinations downtown and would jump at the chance to eat here.   However, I hate, hate, HATE the parking. It's horrific! You can spend 15 minutes driving around, lurking and waiting for someone to come out just so you can snatch their space. It takes so long to find parking, you could probably place an order form the parking lot and your sandwich would be ready by the time you found parking. On top of this, the Papa John's delivery drivers block people in and that makes it even more of a cluster.   Short Story Time: The parking is so bad that as I'm trying to leave the parking lot, I get stuck behind this woman and I'm patiently waiting. As I'm waiting, this guy gets in his car and just backs into me! Luckily it wasn't anything serious but damn. It really is a battle for one delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and the pasta is decent.  Cookies are top notch and the service is really good.  Ordering by phone first is the way to go.  Save you a ton of time!  Please try the chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Apparently all the people in my department used to go to this place all of the time a couple of years ago. I'm new around here but I got a recommendation from a colleague to try it out, although I was concerned with the average ratings it had received.   The slight hipster artsy feel of the employees and decor made me feel rather comfortable there. The sandwich was good, a little bit too much mayo for my diet, but I suppose it's not Sacks' fault that I eat out too much... or is it?"}
{"text":"I am at work today, talking to my co-worker, letting her know that I was going to Taco Bell for lunch.  She looked at me disappointed, and said \"I never want to hear that you are gaining weight again...stop eating that!\"  She then told me about Sacks....I decided that I would give it a shot. (not that is was any healthier....) I wasn't real impressed with the layout of the place, even where it was located.  It was getting busy when I walked in...and had no idea what to order.  I ended up with the Van Gogh, which was roast beef, dill, alfalfa sprouts, cheese and I subsituted the marble rye for a tomato basil bread.  The girl at the counter was really sweet and helpful at helping me pick out what I wanted.   My sandwich was really good, and it wasn't just a normal sandwich.  I also liked the little cookie that they snuck into my bag.  And the fact that they have Stewart's root beer was a nice bonus. The only thing that I could say that was negative is that I left there still smelling the kitchen on my coat.  And it wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"I don't know what the case was - bad day - new staff - out of stock ingredients  Whatever, one bad order leads to a bad memory for life.  I used to get good sandwiches and salads from Sacks. Staff was on point. Lettuce was fresh, ingredients were available, prices were moderate, and a complimentary cookie was included with the order.  This time, my order was mediocre at best. The staff was scatter brained. The lettuce tasted like a cheap brand of stale packaged foods, substitutions were made without my say-so, prices increased, and the complimentary cookie turned out to be a quarter of a cookie.  Yes, you heard right. The cookie had been cut into quarters and one piece was served with the order.  How embarassing! I'm the one who paid for the order...but I'm the one who's embarassed.    ????  I would give three stars - only because stale packaged lettuce is still edible. But in comparison to my last review, I have to drop the rating to two."}
{"text":"Ok, Ok, OK, i don't write reviews about places i do not like, so the only time you get a review from me, is if i like it.  SACKS - AWESOME!!!!!! clearly 4 thumbs up.    I had the Sacks Jazz it is Bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, avocado, cream cheese, on 12 grain bread.  I like it because its not to bready, not sure if that's a word.  Anyway i recommend it, and when i was there, they got me my order very quickly, but i do tend to go to places when the lunch hours are slow.  I am heading there again today, impress me twice, and your a star.  Apparently SACKS is already a great place, i am just late to the party"}
{"text":"Reasons I go to Sacks Art of Sandwicherie:  - Because it's delicious! - To introduce friends to the deliciousness of Sacks' sandwiches - It's a delicious picnic/outing meal with Friends/Family - A good meeting place - Lunch Date - Cause I want something delicious - Etc.  Sacks Art of Sandwich is one of my favorite sandwich places. I love it for so many reasons, and I have many stories, and events that I could share and reminiscence about that could make this review comment into a book of itself. However, I won't do that, but I will say that Sacks is one of the greatest restaurants that I ever been to. It far different from any other sandwich place, because of their customer services, delicious food, and the many memories Sacks' food can create.  Without a doubt, would recommend Sacks Art of Sandwicherie to anyone!"}
{"text":"We ordered from this place at work yesterday. It was stellar!  Ok first the cookies. If I could just rate them 5 stars I would have in a heart beat. They are moist and soft and chewy and..Im making myself drool.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, on marble rye with Swiss, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, mustard and horseradish. It was a very tasty sandwich. I was kind of soggy when they got it to me but that is what happens when you ask for it to be delivered.  The large was big, however I like my lemonade sweet, if you don't like it sweet this is for you.  The delivery was a reasonable amount of time. No JJ's fast but I wasn't gnawing off my own arm. All in all if you work near this place, go to school near this place etc, certainly order from here."}
{"text":"First of all, this food spot didn't get a full five stars because upon walking in most of the tables were not clean & could have been taken care of better.   However, the sandwiches truly hit the spot. They have a lot of options on the menu, along with a build-your-own option. If you're craving a solid sandwich or even a healthy lunch option- this is the perfect spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Came very highly recommended and I will give it another chance. However, ordered the Van Gogh with a pickle, chips, and a drink. The sandwich came with thick slices of pumpernickel which is fine but there was about two ounces of roast beef as opposed to a half pound of alfalfa with one slice of havarti. I don't understand places that make sandwiches where the meat is the least represented portion of the sandwich.   I believe they would have gotten at least a four from me if it was a roast beef sandwich instead of an alfalfa sandwich featuring a cameo by roast beef. For that price I can get a double meat from dilly's deli and get half a pound of meat on my sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband was scheduled to have an outpatient procedure at St. Joseph's across the street, so I scouted out places for a quick, healthy lunch. Sacks fit the bill nicely. It was a quick walk over. The dining room was full--all tables were claimed, though there were empty seats--but there was no line ahead. I ordered a Symphony and bought a bad of Fritos for my son. The cashier immediately told me there were cups for water over to one side; I really appreciated that she brought that up before I could ask!  I stood off to one side to wait. A huge mass of people came in. I was impressed with how quickly the cashier took orders and how fast the kitchen was completing them. My sandwich was done in five minutes!  We went out to the patio, which was almost totally empty. It was a hot day, about 108 forecast for the high, but the patio was completely shaded and quite comfortable. I felt like I'd found a top secret hidey hole.   The Symphony sandwich was good. It reminded me of the kinds of sandwiches I used to make when I was a kid! It wasn't gourmet or fancy, but it didn't need to be, and it sure was a lot fresher, better, and healthier than what it offered by fast food places.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Sacks, but the menu is diverse, the food is good, and it's always nice to know of reliable places like this. Plus, you get a chocolate chip cookie with your meal. That's always a nice touch."}
{"text":"I am eating the \"Sack's Overture\" which is a roast beef sandwich which underwhelmed at first until I realized it lacked the magic ingredient salt. Salt applied and I'm happy with this place. It's an affordable sandwich with African art on the walls and nice people. 5 stars for finding a niche and owning it."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, fast service, and a cookie too!    FOOD  I ordered the Dali Sandwich and it was delish! There was plenty of egg salad (and no onions or celery in the salad- that made me happy) piled on my sandwich and the 12 grain bread was moist and fresh.  I had requested no bacon or mayo and they made just how I asked with no complaints.  My coworkers ordered the Chicken Salad and enjoyed it as well- though the lettuce looked a little yellow to me- I like mixed greens usually. But the chicken Salad looked great.   AMBIANCE  A little crowded at lunch time- and at 11:45 there was only one parking spot in the lot. There are regular tables and chairs and an area to sit outside. I also like that they had a special \"to go\" pick up line. It was very organized.   OTHER  I had a full stomach for $5.00 (I had water to drink). I f you're in the mood for a simple sandwich or you want a monstrous one with sprouts, peppers, and different kinds of cheese- try this place."}
{"text":"Ove the course of the last 10 years, due to recurring treatment at St Joes hospital across the street, I've patronized Sacks many times. In my experience, they've lost ground over the years. Don't get me wrong, it's an ok place to grab a quick sandwich and beats the heck out of fast food. But as delis go it's not up to the caliber of other local establishments.   They have a decent variety of sandwiches and, for the most part, their ingredients are quality. Unfortunately, the weakest part of their offerings is the key ingredient: the lunchmeat. Not only have I seen a drop off in the quality of the meat but the quantity seems to have dropped as well.  My three most recent visits have yielded small portions of meat. The formerly lean, rare roast beef has been replaced by well done stuff reminiscent of pre-packaged. The turkey has been dry and sub par.  Because it's such a busy place I can accept that tables aren't always clean and ready, but a roast beef sandwich at their price point shouldn't be more filler than meat.  I'm sorry to see the decline. For convenience I'm sure they'll stay in my rotation but Scott's Generations, Mile High Deli and a couple others will be the choice when the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the symphony sandwich. Cream cheese, avocado and alfalfa sprouts on a freshly baked bread can not be beat! They pay attention to quality and service!"}
{"text":"Average sandwich at best. Was expecting a melt in your mouth experience kinda thing. Well, I can't say I was blown away or anything. The staff was friendly and the sandwich was delivered to my table in no time at all. It was piled high and all the ingredients within tasted fresh...the bread however was sub par. For the money, I would rather go to Pane Bianco any day...Last but not least, the complimentary chocolate chip cookie was a nice feature."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I sometimes meet with my wife when she has time and I have my doctor appointments and we have lunch at Sacks.  The food is very good.  The food is fresh.  The food is generous in portion size.  And the the food is fast.  Hard to find someplace to sit at lunch sometimes, but this place is so darned good, I would wait.  Try the oriental noodle salad, pretty darned good.  The cookie they give you is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Sacks is growing on me.  I think that I like my sandwich more when I do the \"self portrait\" and pick what I want on my sandwich.  They have plenty of choices, but I guess I can be picky with my sandwiches.  It gets busy here, lunch is best if you go a bit early or a bit later.  The phone is best for pick ups, it's super easy and super quick.  The best part is that you get a little cookie with your sandwich and they have multiple iced tea selections.  All of them are delicious!"}
{"text":"Sacks is a great little place.  One issue and I know this wouldn't seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me.  I can never find a parking place or a seat.  The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I don't go just because of the crowds.    The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops in the valley. Consistently good service and high quality of food. The cookie is a nice touch and they have punch card!"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times in the last 2 weeks... probably a good idea to hook these guys up with a review.... yeah theyre good! Fresh bread, fresh meat, fresh veggies. Good dressings and specialty sandwiches. Overture is my favorite so far but theyve all been really good. They also havr canada dry ginger ale on the fountain drink. Great sandwich spot. Good portions and decent prices."}
{"text":"One of my biggest disappointments in having to abandon gluten has been missing out on the unbelievable sandwiches from Sacks. Grilled chicken, freshly sliced ham, chunks of turkey... whatever you want, they've got it! 9-grain wheat, rye, sourdough or spinach wrap, the options are literally endless. And if you're smart, you'll trust them and order the daily special - it's different each day, and always more amazing than the last (if you can believe it?!?)!   For the salad-eaters, hands down... the best tuna salad in the valley! And trust me, get the honey-poppy seed dressing. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Every sandwich I get from here is to die for!! The cookies they have are so good, hands down my favorite sandwich place!"}
{"text":"They always have new and delicious daily specials. I normally order the encore (similar to a cheese steak) with hot peppers and feta yogurt... YUM! I am not a fan of mayo and finding something that adds moisture to my sandwich and improves the flavor is major for me.  They carry multiple flavors of iced tea and their lemonade is very good."}
{"text":"I always get the Chicken Salad here so I can't comment on the other types of sandwiches that they have. The Chicken Salad is good but not Cassella's great. (check previous review on Cassellas) They used to have the best cookies here but today's was a bit overcooked. Still good but not as chewy goody as always. The place is too small and was very crowded ( no place to sit for me today) and the service tends to not be very good.While they are fast I don't find the staff very friendly.  It is also on the high end expensive for just a sandwich. I go every now and again when in the neighborhood because I love good sandwiches. I would say better than average but nothing to write home about. Also, a tip- go on off lunch hours."}
{"text":"One of the better sandwich shops around, I mainly order the meatball sandwich which is excellent. The Meatballs are very good along with a good portion of marinara sauce and the bread is good also.  A Busy spot for lunch with limited parking that shares primo spaces with papa johns so be patient, the wait for a parking space is well worth it.  Will be back for their great sandwiches, also a location on Indian School Road and 42nd Street in the Arcadia area."}
