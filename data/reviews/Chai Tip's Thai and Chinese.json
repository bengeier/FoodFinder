{"text":"Use to come here all the time when I was living in North las vegas. Food was ok back than,  so finally I was able to drop in for the first time in 6 years. There fried rice is still good and there fried chicken still tasted the same even after all this years. Even though chai tips is not world class there food in my opinion is still decent for a hole in the wall. I will definitely be back again if im ever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I was tired of driving all the way to my favorite Thai restaurant off Maryland Parkway, so I decided to try this place on the North side of town. I was in search of Shrimp Pad Thai, and the reviews seemed pretty good.

The Shrimp Pad Thai was very tasty, just what I imagined, but the dish definitely could have used more shrimp. I didn't taste any peanuts, next time I'll be sure to ask for some.

Shrimp Fried Rice was very good and tasty; again not enough shrimp...maybe I'm just a shrimpaholic.

Crab rangoon was good. Wonton Soup was delicious on that cold weekend!! I'll definitely be back for more!

I spent $34 bucks, but it was a good $34 bucks! It's one of those tasty holes in the wall that you'd probably find on Triple D.... IJS!"}
{"text":"It's just a small place but the food is big on flavor. I had the red curry chicken and it excited my expectations. My wife had the pad Thai and she thought it was as good as ant she had in Thailand. She was born and raised there so she knows real Thai flavors. The staff was super nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"They have some of the best curry I've ever tasted I want more yes! I enjoy  everything I can wait to go back next weekend."}
{"text":"cant speak much english but good quality food and great price!!! the food takes awhile but is cooked fresh"}
{"text":"I was visiting in LV and this came up on my GPS and was close.  It isn't the fanciest place, but compared to some of the small Thai restaurants I dined at in Thailand.... it was, and brought back memories....  The Thai restaurant in our small town has a green curry dish that I love, so does Chai Tips.  It was as tasty, but they use dark chicken meat, ours uses white meat, which I prefer.  I'll probably return if I get back in the area.  I also got to embarass myself with some of my much forgotten and broken Thai with the cashier.  Kinda fun!"}
{"text":"I decided to order delivery from here and regret every second and penny I wasted! First, the person taking the order barely spoke English, so not only got my order wrong, but couldn't even get my address right. 1 1/2 hours after placing my order, they finally showed up, with me guiding them via cell phone to my address that was only 10 minutes away. The food was no longer warm, it wasn't what I ordered, the vegetable chow mein was actually regular spaghetti noodles, with 3 vegetables, and the pot-stickers tasted like they were stuffed with dog food. I've had better food from Panda Express for better price. At least my dogs will be enjoying the leftovers."}
{"text":"This places food is always amazing and their fried rice is the best I've ever had. I compare everyone else's rice to them and no place is close. Delicious for lunch and dinner totally recommend trying some good food here!"}
{"text":"I recently found this place and I love it. I haf no idea it was there and it's less than 5 minutes away. I've been here 3 times in the last 3 weeks.

So far I've had house pad thai, egg rolls, shrimp puffs, shrimp fried rice, and pot stickers. My brother and myself ordered multiple items just to try. The pot sticker sauce is a must try. Everything else is good so far. I plan to try more soon."}
{"text":"The worst Thai food quality on MLK.  A total disgrace to the Thai cuisine...The place is poo poo sauce just like their claimed Panang Curry.  The Panang Curry they served was actually a poor man's Tom Yum soup.  No veggies and no taste of curry.  The owner's back of the house is trash and their establishment should be closed down and investigated by the city health inspectors.  I wish Yelp had negative star ratings bc they absolutely suck...They are the worst and should be avoided like the plague.  GFY to the cook who made our food and the lady who said, \"#2 is not spicy bc we didn't use any curry.\"

{"text":"Hmmm... All I can say about this place is... The food was ok.

The building is ran down and easy to miss. Just an old beat up hole in the wall. The oredering process is slow. I walked in and stood at the counter for about five minutes before someone from the back decided to stop their conversation and come out to assist me. There was no bell to ring and I've yelled out twice.

The main menu is small and is on the wall above the register and all it was is a few pictures of food taped to the wall as if the pics were ripped out of a magazine lol.

I decided to just stick to something I'm use to eating so I ordered a plate of combination rice. Chicken, pork, and shrimp fried rice. After waiting about 12 minutes for my food to come up the cashier opened up my to go plate to show me that my order was correct but failed to realize that her thumb was in my rice! o_O

I was a little upset and disgusted that my plate of $8 rice was fondled with. Besides that, the shrimp in the rice was raw and the pork wasn't nothing but red colored fat.

Overall, I will never eat at this place ever again and my dog had an amazing lunch."}
{"text":"if your not going to serve customers until 9pm don't post you are open until 9pm change your hours to 8:30pm especially on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"the food is really good but the fact that i have to pay $1.50 extra to REPLACE (not add!!) chicken with tofu is crazy. Other places around the area do not charge. The lunch special usually costs around $7 normally and i end up having to pay around $10. I can get cheaper anywhere else to be honest, like amazing thai!"}
{"text":"Was recently in town on business and stopped by for lunch. Pad See Ewe Shrimp. It was amazing !!! Good portion size as well.  I liked the food so much I went back the next day and tried the Pad Thai - equally as good !!  I will definitely come back here on my next trip."}
{"text":"I love them ! So sweet and genuine my food is always so good and they have no problem fixing something if it's not what you expected . Awesome ."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Their rice is fresh. Panang curry is so good! I have been going here for about three years."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food especially since it is very authentic. They are not much in the way of decor but food is always top notch. The crab ragoons btw are to die for!!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside, or on the inside for that fact, but it makes up for that in food quality, price, and service. 

The price was typical for a small family owned restaurant. I got pineapple fried rice with shrimp for around $8.95, which is pretty good for a meal that includes shrimp. 

The food not only looked great but tasted great too. Some may say the quality of food isn't top notch, but I felt it was superb. Shrimp wasn't too shrimpy tasting, and ruce was some of the best I've ever had. 

Now the costumer service. We were greater with a warm smile by who I can only guess was one of the owners. She was very helpful in telling my mom which meals were spicy and which weren't. Finally upon leaving she stopped us on the way out to give us 2 extra bottles of water. Classy. I'd happily recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for take-out Thai and Chinese food! Low prices, consistently good food. My husband and I have been enjoying this small restaurant's food for many years. I haven't seen any reviews of the Hot and Sour Soup, which I consider the best I've had anywhere. Chock full of fresh straw mushrooms, bean sprouts, egg, tofu and wafer-thin julienned carrots, this soup rocks my taste buds with its perfect blend of tangy rice vinegar, garlic and just the right amount of thickening. 

Also, give the Chicken Larb a try - it's a hot, vinegar based ground chicken \"salad\" (it's served on chunks of cabbage). It's less of a salad than an entree, and the mint, chili, lime juice, green onions and rice powder meld together to make it lip-smacking good. You can order it from mildly hot to \"Hoo-AH!\" atomic blast, and it's superb. 

The seafood Lad Nah is also excellent, with a bed of rice noodles topped with seafood and broccoli with a soy gravy. It's not a chili-hot dish, but if you like heat, just ask for it. 

I love the Thai Style Red Curry Chicken, which is marinated in Asian spices, and served in a lovely balanced coconut curry sauce. If you are more of a Green Curry Chicken fan, it's equally good with the addition of zucchini and mint leaves in a Thai curry sauce. Yum-Delicious, both! 

While the restaurant itself is bare bones and food is served on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils, as take-out fare, it can't be beat. We get their take-out a couple times a month, and have yet to be disappointed. I'd give it a five-star review if they offered dining-in with real plates and silverware. The first thing I do with take-out from here is to re-plate it so it looks as delicious as it tastes."}
{"text":"Chai Tip is a simple, Thai-Chinese restaurant that doesn't flaunt much at all.  Imagine the inside of a typical Roberto's Taco Shop or Caprioti's, and add a couple of Thailand posters.  That pretty much describes the inside decor.  There's a couple of tables spread around, plain white walls, and that's about it.  

Chai Tip offers a lot of Chinese dishes, but the owners are Thai.  Since I'm not a big Chinese food person, I ordered the pad see ew with pork, and a Thai iced tea.  The Thai iced tea wasn't too bad at all.  I thought it was a little bit small, but wasn't too small to make me feel totally ripped off.

The pad see ew had pork rib that was prepared similar to Chinese red-cooked pork, with the skin being red and a little sweetened.  I have actually since a similar style of pork at an authentic Thai restaurant served on the Thai (no English) menu, and the added flavor made the dish a little more interesting than usual.  The Chinese broccoli was just a little passed due, but I've had worse at LoS, so not docking any points here.  The only real complaint I had was that this dish was a little greasy for my liking.  Overall though, it had a good taste and I finished the entire dish.

I wouldn't say that Chai Tip is a great restaurant for dining in, and its not a top quality Thai restaurant.  Its much more of a to-go restaurant than anything else.  I made some casual conversation with the cashier, and asked why they had so much Chinese on the menu.  In very broken English, she explained that for every Thai dish they sell, they sell three Chinese dishes.  I guess that answers that question.  You can't blame a business owner for trying to make ends meat."}
{"text":"A very small Thai place that I've been going to for years now. You could miss it if you didn't know where it was. The little ol' Thai lady that mans the front is the best! I can barely understand a word she says but somehow we always know what each other is saying. She always gives us free drinks, free Thai tea refills. She's adorable! 

I revisited this place today, havent been here in ages. The renovated the menu. Looks a lot cleaner now. Today we ordered:

Thai Beef Salad $8.25 -- this my usual in every Thai place I go to. I ordered it as a spicy level 5 & it got my mouth watering! I don't remember their spice level being so hot! Must be a good year for those peppers! 

Chicken Pad Thai $8.25 -- first time I had it here & it was ordered as a spicy level 10! & boy was that baby hot like the Sahara Desert! It was soooo good though until you got that after taste of the spiciness. It really kicks you in the mouth! The water couldn't even help my mouth. 

Lesson of the day-- don't order food too spicy where you won't be able to taste it. 

Other than that, the portions are pretty big for the price you pay for it. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for 16 years. The best food and Family.  Even know folks drive half an hr. to come back to this neighborhood for their food."}
{"text":"This is my only favorite Thai restaurant in North Las Vegas. We go here for lunch regularly.  We love their soups and salads."}
{"text":"Great food. I just moved near here and this has become one of me and my wife's favorite spots. We order here 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"Overall, the food is okay. In my opinion, the best thing on the menu is The Mint Chicken. They cook to order, but I've had better. It doesn't seem really like a Thai restaurant versus an \"Asian-American Random food choice\" restaurant. Sometimes it's hard to communicate with the staff, but most of the time they are friendly (one exception being a time when I asked for fried rice and I guess the cook didn't feel like it that day and REFUSED...needless to say, I found somewhere else to eat that day). 
We used to try to order delivery for lunch at work, but it ALWAYS took them forever to actually deliver (later, we found out they usually only have one person cooking).

The prices aren't the best...they do carryout (good because the restaurant is tiny and way outdated with uncomfortable seats)....I give them a B."}
{"text":"I've been getting food from Chai Tip's for several years.   They delivered to the hospital the night my son was born and their delivery driver has become a regular at our house.   When given a substandard orange chicken (we ate it all anyways)  we called a week later and were given a free entree.   The family is great and we have no complaints.   While not high cuisine we really like the place.  We recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Stopped by to eat before I went to see my dentist. I mistakenly came early so had some time to kill. Spent it here and getting free Coke refills at McDonalds. Might as well, get the sugary drink in before I get scolded for staining my teeth too much with coffee and soda. You never know what work might be done and after all that probing, your gums are sensitive and you don't really want to chow down. I am not a big Thai food guy but it was close by so I stopped in. I ordered the Chinese equivalent of fried rice.....pad Thai. It was a large portion and it was tasty.  Pricier than my hole in the wall Chinese favorites but it was good. Service was good. Not much to fuss about since I ordered a noodle dish and water. I'd eat here again if I was in the area. There's really only one Thai place I really like and that's Archie's. The other place is called Weera Thai or something on Sahara and Valley View. I think I like that one more due to its tiny coziness and attentive service more than anything. The food is tasty."}
{"text":"The food is steadily declining in quality.. order delivery twice a month and stop in for lunch at work about 4 times a month.    The service is not what it used to be.. make sure you do your own math. Their famous for telling you your total is 10$ less than the actual , then making you pay it anyway.  Has happened to me twice.. and now this is about the fifth time ive gotten cold food. And the young lady on the phone , april could seem to care less about her mistakes.. no apology.. nothing.. i will no longer  be a patron here. I've been screwed too many times. I'll spend my 50$ elsewhere oh yeah... and the \"free eggroll\" and free fried rice gimmick is just for show. I've never gotten a free eggroll or an offer. Smh"}
{"text":"I can't speak too much to the food all I can say is the staff is so amazing here and they are always friendly and warm .. they make some authentic stuff from what I can see and it is always delicious but I have to be honest that I've not had lots of Thai places so I can't throw down culinary expertise but I do love this place"}
{"text":"Chai Tips is a great Thai restaurant.  The food absolutely exceeded my expectations.  I tried the Pad Thai, Sesame Chicken, and Tom Yum.  All were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by the food here but the owners were very friendly. My bf got the red curry with shrimp and I got the chicken pad Thai along with some wontons. The wontons weren't very good and the dipping sauce looks weird. The pad thai was not very good. It's easily my favorite thai dish so I'm no stranger to the dish and this was a let down. The chicken tasted kind of questionable. On the other hand the red curry was very yummy. Inside is very plain, more of a takeout place. The prices were pretty typical for takeout."}
{"text":"Danger! Danger! Danger! Do not enter........ This  is the worst place I've ever been! !!!!! First of all they do not have plates and glasses they gave us a thin Styrofoam plate to eat off of and it was dine in!!!! When I asked for water she told me they do not have any water I was so amazed! The customer service was horrible and the food was so little. On the bright side I have to admit the lemon chicken was delicious but the chow mein was horrible they use spaghetti noodles not chow mein noodles. I will never ever go back there again."}
