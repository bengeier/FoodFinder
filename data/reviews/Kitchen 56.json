{"text":"The service was good, atmosphere fine. I had a chopped chicken salad. It had 5 tiny slices of chicken, a 1/2 cup of iceberg, an entire raw onion cut on top, a few tomatoes. It was a salad I could have purchased in a bag at the grocery store, only difference was it was $13. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Second visit. First time in was during happy hour. Ordered off the happy hour menu and was very pleased with the entire visit and I would have given 4 stars at that time. Today was a different story. Had to wait 10 minutes for a table, ok if busy, but restaraunt was basically empty, but was told we had to wait to see if people who made reservations would show up. Finally seated and were given water by a waitress who was over the top perky. I appreciate upbeat people, but dont talk to me like I am a child at the doctors office, you come off as fake and irritating. Two of the water glasses had black stuff at the bottom. Showed to waitress she commented that it was probably fruit flies. It looked like cracked black pepper or small bits of charcoal to me. Glasses were removed.
Food was ordered and arrived in a short amount of time. Appetizers were ok, but the dipping sauce for both the pretzles and chips were  bland..Ordered a firebrand chicken sandwich, was told the the bread was a flatbread, their version of pita bread. Turned out that it was served on a pretzle bread/roll, which tasted ok, just not what was advertised. I had their black angus burger. Dissapointing to say the least. The smallest 1/3 pound burger I have ever seen. Small plain bun, two pickle chips, two limp red onion rings, no lettuce or tomato, and a petite amount of ketchup that was not enough for the burger, let alone the fries. Asked for more ketchup and mustard, another petite portion arrived. I am a big boy, I can handle a ketchup bottle, I promise not to waste or make a mess. The flavor of the burger was the dealbreaker. It had a intense chemical taste, at first I thought a gas grill flavor, but the more I ate the more it tasted like charcoal lighter fluid.I did not finish. 
I have no problem paying top dollar for my food, but I expect to get what I pay for. (see Becketts Table) I will be back for half price happy hour food , but will likely not be ordering off the full price menu again"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service I have ever had. Dinner took 3 hours in total. Food was cold when it came out, and the server brought out the wrong order. Rather than taking it back, she asked if we \"were good with eating the steak she brought\" instead of our food. Awful, awful experience. Not worth the try."}
{"text":"Limited kids meals..Pricey. and not enough choices.
My egg dish was bland. Good service but waited for a while to get check. Like the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I don't know why I continue to waste my time with this place - overpriced mediocre food and the most unfriendly staff in Arcadia.

I guess I just want it to be good because of the location, but I'm over it.

Last time I'm there we walk in and ask if we can watch the NBA Playoff game - the bar tender tells us he's rather watch the hockey so sorry.  Pretty intense."}
{"text":"The parking is problematic as the lot is very small.  Lunch menu is pretty expensive and bland.  The live entertainment is not what it used to be.  Check out the beer pizza special for dinner.  There are 700 restaurants in the area and this place needs to find a niche."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Friday. I really want to like this place because it is so close to my home. It has a decent atmosphere and I found the staff perfectly pleasant. I have no complaints with the personnel.

Unfortunately, my rating is as is because of the food. The food is the key to a good restaurant so it's going to drive my rating.

I had the \"Black Angus Burger\" which ultimately amounted to two beef patties with cheese on a bun. It was sort of like meatloaf between buns. I admit I left the onions off but I guess I didn't read the menu carefully enough - that's all it was. No lettuce, no tomatoes, nothing else except some pickles attached to the top with a toothpick. It was just a hunk of meat with cheese. I have to say it was a bit gross.

My companion had the \"Chicken Salad Wrap\" which also turned out to be surprisingly simple. Basically some chicken salad scooped into a soft bread rolled into a wrap. Nothing special.

Both entrees came with fries that neither of us found particularly good.

We were both disappointed but we are going to give it another try. Maybe we just ordered two of their less than stellar menu items. However, a burger is pretty basic.

So... I can't say don't go but at this point, the food just doesn't hold up. Again, no problems with the atmosphere or staff."}
{"text":"I've now been to Kitchen 56 on two occasions and both times I was dissatisfied. I feel like this place could be so much more but just isn't. I agree with most reviews on here that the food wasn't bad but just nothing special at all, especially for the price. Unless you go during happy hour, which I do hear is good, things are very overpriced.  

The staff is friendly enough but the service was terrible. On one occasion our entire table had nearly finished our entrees before one member of our group had received his food. Both times I have been the service from the wait staff and kitchen has been extremely slow, even when there is no one in the restaurant.  

Unless you are going for happy hour, or just enjoy very mediocre restaurants, Skip it."}
{"text":"Blah!!!!  Strange menu!  I have tried this place 4 times now.  Each time I am disappionted so, today was the last try.  Food has no flavor.  They are doing nothing interesting here and the service is lame."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight. For a four top, it was about $75, not too bad!  Ordered 3 burgers and a rib platter.   Service was terrible as the server didn't bother to write down the orders. One person ordered a full slab of ribs with extra sauce on the side, received only half a slab and no extra sauce. One person ordered a burger with fries, received a salad. Third person ordered a green chili burger with fries and fries were half done. I ordered a double cheese burger with fries. I also asked for mayo, ketchup and mustard on the side. Server said beef patties were 5 oz each. So I thought I should get a pretty large sandwich. WRONG.  Restaurant must use 60/40 or 70/30 ground beef, as I kid you not, I could place both of those patties side by side to fill up the bun. Ordered medium and received medium, however the burger was so burnt on the outside, it was inedible. Should get lettuce, tomato and pickle? Nope just onion and sweet pickles. Sorry but if your menu says pickle on a burger, you should assume dill, unless otherwise specified. So I received a charred inedible burger, with onion and sweet pickles. No sauce. Had to ask for the mayo and mustard. Fries were half cooked and al dente. Fries should never be al dente!  I picked everything apart and probably ate less than one sixth of my food. It was nice of the server to ask if I wanted a to-go box for the chopped up mess on my plate!  This was the third time I have eaten here. First time was cocktails and apps on the patio. That was great. Second time was only for desert, as my friend received a free desert coupon for his birthday. When we arrived, even though the coupon doesn't specify, it turns out you need to order an entree to get your free desert. Third time was a total disaster. I have worked food service for 30 years and have never written such a lengthy review. Please tell me Kitchen 56, why should I return?"}
{"text":"I don't understand all these negative reviews.  First of all I like having a restaurant in this neighborhood within walking distance. Sure beats having an abandoned purple car garage. Normally I don't write a review for restaurants.  If I am happy with the food I go back, if not I don't return. I am not the type to want to hurt people's business because of my one experience. I feel like it shows a certain self importance to think that your one experience at a restaurant is typical of all experience. 

Getting to the review. Each time I have eaten here my party and I have been very happy with the food and service. Today I went for lunch, which is something new they are offering.  I am happy they are offering lunch.  Prices are right in the ballpark for what you would expect at lunch at $8-$12 range.  The lunch plates come with fries or salad which to me wasn't obvious based on the online menu.  I had a turkey, egg, and cheese with fries.  I love egg sandwiches so I was happy to see it on the menu and it didn't disappoint. I had the fries which were good.  My partner had the veggie burger which they were happy with.  They really enjoyed the actual veggie patty which they could tell was homemade.   

The restaurant was crowded and doing a good business which I was happy to see.  I was also happy to see they handled the lunch rush well with the service being great.  All in all an excellent experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is a true disaster. Have eaten here twice. Once with a large party. They knew we where coming 3 days ahead of our arrival.  Poor planning on there part. Our group came for Brunch.  Understaffed.  We had 15 people. Remember we told them 3 days before our arrival how large our party was. One waitress for that large party. Food came out very sporadically. Even 15 to 20 minutes apart. Then overcooked and not what people had order.  Then my husband and I went back about 3 weeks later. We were sat down. Then 5 minutes went by before a person showed up at our table. Took our drink order. Then came back to take our order. Well then the real waiting  began. 15 minutes no drinks 35 minutes no food. Excuse given was the bartenders don't  know how to open a bottle of liquor that's why our drinks are late. Then our food was late due to new kitchen staff the same excuse that was  given when we went for brunch. Never again. Save yourself the trouble go to a Dennys."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been wanting to try this place for a while.  I took my friend here for a celebratory dinner last week.  Overall, we like this place.  Service was very good.  The bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock, so our server suggested another bottle but offered it at the same price as the bottle we wanted.  Nice gesture.  

The corn cakes with pulled pork appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  Very good.  The Arcadia Salad was also good.  Being from New Mexico and loving green chile, the green chile Mac n Cheese was a little dissapointing.  The ribs were ok.  Certainly not fall off the bone.

Love the ambiance and openess...with the exception of the music.  More about that below.  Interesting artwork with the chalk board feature, although it is so cluttered to the point that we couldn't take it all in.  Sometimes less is more.  

As I aluded to earlier...I'm a firm believer that music is the single-most make or break factor to a great ambiance.  The music simply does not fit.  Paula Abdul did not add to my enjoyment of dinner in any way.  Maybe we were just at a cheesy point of the mix, but I think some more edgy/progressive/hip music could do a lot in further creating an enjoyable ambiance.

Overall, I'm a fan.  Good Job."}
{"text":"The place has potential due to location and atmosphere. Service was good. However the food wasn't worth the price.
My girlfriend had the skillet pot pie and the crust was amazing and the presentation was fine. But the filling pie tasted like canned stew. It tasted as if it was obviously NOT made from scratch.
I had the Angus green chili burger. It tasted fine because the quality of the beef was well, but it was a very small patty. And the fries that came with it also tasted good but was a small portion. A restaurant should know that the cost of fries is so low compared to the other products and should stack the plate full of fries to compliment the meal.
Again i feel that the place has potential.
I would only comeback for strictly cocktails and would not eat off the menu unless i absolutly knew changes were made.
Good service though."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my family. We were not very impressed with the menu, maybe we are just spoiled from normally having lots of options but it was basically salad, burgers, sandwiches, or Mac n cheese. I had the pulled pork but the flavor was too smoky for me. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this place, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"went there many times and the place is quite good, the food portions a generous and a little off beat.  The service is always excellent.
Highlights calamari salad and house made potato chips n dip
should start every meal.
Beet salad was very good n flavor full.
Pizzas is always a crowd pleaser.
A wonderful addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best burger and service I have had in a long time.

1.The burger and fries that I had at this restaurant was the best I have had in a long time. Cooked properly and seasoned perfectly. Fries were fresh cut potato and well disappeared off my plate.

2. The server was kind good at giving recommendations and made the experience that much better. my drink never got empty and attention was paid to what we needed for the table. I have never been more pleased with a wait staff in a long time.

The only gripe I have is parking and the ability to get in can be a little annoying but a good hole in the wall none the less."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great food and Service. Really enjoyed the Wings and BBQ Sandwich.  The Calamari Appetizer was fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for girl's nights out and I love it. The patio is absolutely wonderful.  It's great for a group gathering. There is room to mingle and the drink/wine menu is huge. I love their \"Grown Up\" Lemonade. The food is also great. I would suggest a cheese plate to start. The honey and the cheeses are all great. I would definitely suggest the Arcadia salad, it's super tasty. I also really enjoyed the sear Ahi tuna. I do want to head there for one of their special event brunches. I've been impressed with the food so far and brunch is by far my favorite meal."}
{"text":"I had the green chili burger with the brussel sprout hash.  Excellent!  The design aesthetic in the place is great.  I love the large black and white photo on the west wall."}
{"text":"Nice layout and modern touch inside and out. I was there for lunch and had the fish and chip special. The fish was tasteless.  All tasted was batter, not sure what kind of fish it was but will not get it again. They have 5 dollar lunch special every day and happy hour menu. The drinks did look very tasty. Id like to try the BBQ rib tacos next time. The entree did get kind of pricey, like 20 plus. I pray that they are not all show like the fish. The presentation looked very nice and classy.

****update

I went for happy hour.

Drinks were excellent , lots of variety and only 5$ for their specialty drinks.

My friend ordered the Rib Tacos and was not impressed. She said there was barely any meat on them and what was there was fatty."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood spot. They did a very nice job designing the space, emphasizing a fun hipster vibe. Also has a small outdoor patio where dogs are welcome. Good happy hour specials. I'm not much of a drinker, so I can't speak to the quality of their martinis, but you can see the effort that went into their drink menu. 

I did have a bit of a problem with my food order. A hamburger, ordered medium as was encouraged by the waitress, was actually raw in the middle. It received some extra grill time and was returned to the table with the comment, \"next time I'll remind you to order medium well.\" It was raw in the center! No great apology was needed, but it was the kitchen's error, not the diner's. The rest of our food was quite good.

Still four stars you say, even after being served a raw burger? Yes, a reflection of how much I liked the ambiance of Kitchen 56."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Here right now on a Saturday night.  Enjoying a nice evening with friends hanging at the bar.  Had wings, onion strings and some awesome pork pancakes(seriously.  Not sure what they are called but they're great).  Bar area is open with a nice ooutdoor patio behind it.  Going to play ping pong now with a cold beer.  Ciao!"}
{"text":"First time - good food and beer - neat neighborhood restaurant, bar and location - will come back when up this way"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this little place.  We often go during happy hour for a beer and appetizer.  The happy hour menu is great; bruschetta, baked pretzel, mini tacos plus more..  Draft beers are 1.00 off, wine is 2.00 off.  Both beer and wine selections are excellent.  The staff is friendly and service us tops.  We are thrilled to have discovered this little hide away."}
{"text":"Place was just ok.  I am a green /red chili snob and green chili was not very good.  People and service was good."}
{"text":"I was in the area and not familiar with it, and of course, looked up somewhere to eat on Yelp.
Cool local pub with good food, friendly bartenders, locals were friendly too, and a very decent one man guitar playing soloist which added to a nice dinner with B-Ball on the tubes.
I had the pulled pork sandwich with onion strings...very good.  Slightly spendy but worth it.  I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Service and food are a bit hit-and-miss. Its mushroom 'tart' is really flatbread featuring mushrooms - competent but like some of their other menu items ($10-plus for a giant baked potato with pulled pork and the usual accoutrements) are overpriced. The green chili Mac and cheese may be a signature dish of 56 kitchen but it's a one-trick pony that can overwhelm so unless you're really into it, best select or split as a side. 

On another night we were here, waited 10-12 minutes before we were served water and we had to ask to order another 10 minutes later - despite sitting at the bar, where there were two servers. The prosciutto and figs pizza came out half lukewarm, with 3 of the slices featuring no prosciutto. Granted, there was a large (trivia) party in dining room but it's still lackluster execution.

The staff's friendliness doesn't overcome these shortcomings, alas."}
{"text":"The food & drink here is amazing! Such a great ambiance!  If the weather is nice,  ask for a seat in the patio,  where the fountain makes it sound like you're dining next to a waterfall. :) also, if you bike in, you get a discount!"}
{"text":"Salad with an avocado that was half unripe and half turning brown, a handful of kale, and a $10+price.  Leaden half raw french fries.  Shoe leather, disdainfully under-seasoned steak.  A near $6 side of not quite a handful of shredded brussel sprouts adorned with something akin to Dollar Store bottled Italian dressing. Cute bungalow/diner decor, and a 4 star, kind, caring waitress who seemed as dismayed as her customers with the food, raised my score to a 2 Star.  Owners/chefs please take a ride down to the Vig or the Henry and take in a little TLC and bring it home."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is a nice neighborhood restaurant and they continue to improve.  We went once when it was Vatra and would not have returned had it stayed the same.  The free parking across 56th Street is a nice addition.   As is the new menu.  

We've gone for dinner with the kids in the late Spring, 2011- I had the burger and it was big and delicious.  My daughters giggled with delight when they saw their kid's spaghetti plate- three separate small bowls on a long, narrow platter.  One bowl had noodles, one had the 'sauce on the side' and the other a fruit salad.  Great price at $6.  My husband opted for the Ahi dinner- that was the bummer choice of the evening.  The ahi tuna steak lacked the flavor and texture I expect at $21 a plate.  It was cooked rare, so that wasn't the issue- just cut and quality of the fish.  The wine selection is ok, but the waiter didn't really know the nuances  between the wine by the glass, yet.  

The patio is lovely and nice to see neighbors we know.  Since it is a neighborhood restaurant, it would be nice to be welcomed by the owners or management from time to time.  UPDATE:  I returned for lunch with a girlfriend in May, 2011.  The owner spent quite a bit of time chatting with us and explaining menu choices, their remodel, etc.  She was trained by their general manager and is the day manager.  Nice touch!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I bring clients here a lot and they always rave about the food. Best Mac & cheese ever."}
{"text":"Food not consistent, also, never saw the \"bike\" discount reflected in our bill..."}
{"text":"You might really like the squishy, comfortably wide, white barstools at Kitchen 56. I do. The bar straddles the patio and the restaurant, which is good for people watching, too. Although, you might be distracted by some kitchen traffic.

I never find myself saying \"let's go for dinner,\" but definitely, \"let's meet there.\" Other restaurants - the Grind is nearby - have menus to brag about. But Kitchen 56 has an open feel, with appreciable curiosities on the walls, and the service has been uniformly engaging."}
{"text":"Good consistent food, the pizzas are always phenomenal. Love both the corncakes pulled pork appetizer and the edamame. 

Great place to meet friends for a drink on the patio, or have a nice date with my husband!"}
{"text":"Delicious and different, optimal service but casual, small but spacious, sophisticated and also family friendly! Green Chili Mac & Cheese is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to Kitchen 56 last night and had the WORST service I have ever had at any restaurant!! The waiter was so incredibly RUDE!!!!! The food was ok, but the time was ruined by the service! Even talked to the manager on duty and she seemed clueless. Don't waste your time going to this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the hood! I love the service....always friendly...like they are glad we are there! Edamame rocks and so do happy hour chicken tacos if you like a little kick!!! Meanwhile.....I can bring my dog to the patio when it isn't hot!!!!  It's a big YES at K56!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I grew up in Scottsdale and recently moved to Dallas. Upon coming back I noticed that the neighborhood \"car joint\" was transitioned to a local restaurant and bar. This place us by far one of the best new developments in Scottsdale! Order the green tea lemonade and ask for Stefan!!!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming and not worth the money. Only positive was the cool drinks. However, service was awful. It took 25 minutes to get our first drink after we ordered. A couple if us had the corn cakes-nothing special. Others got the wings, again nothing special. I had the green chili Mac and cheese-again, nothing special. Everything lacked real flavor and that mixed with the poor service made it a bad experience. Won't be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"We have been going to Kitchen 56 for years, because we loved the Calamari. It was served on the most delicious Asian slaw with peanut sauce.  We actually got hungry for it and went what seemed like once a month.  We were out of town for the summer and couldn't wait to go back.  We were so disappointed to find it is no longer on the menu.  The whole menu seems to have changed and we found it very plain and uninteresting.  Probably won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Good happy hour drinks, great service, but mediocre food. We had the fish and chips, they were very greasy and kind of bland. I also had the vegetable soup to start with and was so oily, that I could not eat it."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place... especially since we live less than .5 mile away... it was that same cold vibe when we were there. So sad. I don't get it, it looks like it would have so much potential. Too bad they went so modern with the design of it all. A patio dining experience to me is twinkle lights, hanging plants, cozy chairs, laughter, a friendly bar tender who likes their job, tells jokes, has a warm vibe... but no... none of this. Also, why do people decide to open places like this without great simple food? They should make friends with the owner of Wally's, and take a few notes. Good food+ laid back vibe= talk of the neighborhood. Not a difficult business model. 

I'd like this place to add some fun tables out front, where you can sip on wine and enjoy the vibe of the hood, some nice outdoor music, hanging planters, a courtyard with grass instead of the 5 parking spots they have there...a doggie dish outside of it all with a menu that has the best wings in town, the best pasta dishes, a nice breakfast menue, and a neat coffee bar!"}
{"text":"I'm still as obsessed as I was the first time I came here. 

They have a redesigned menu with slightly higher prices but the PBR is still cheap and I've yet to find better waiters elsewhere. Our old waiter even came up and said hi. Huge thumbs up to Kitchen 56!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this restaurant since they opened and haven't written a review because every time we come it's a different experience. On our visit today for lunch the one major change I noticed is the prices went up. More than what I think is fair. 

We visited during the lunch hour and almost every thing was $12-$16. Most salads don't have a protein and the salad that I ordered had so little chicken it should be considered bacon bits. We also had Mac and Cheese $12 again for nothing memorable. Noodles and Cheese. Service was slow... I usually hope to have my food within 15-20 minutes for lunch service but it seemed to push the later end of the time frame. 

We love the patio and the view of Camelback is great. 

We may come back for a drink but we won't be eating here again anytime soon.

Oh and they had a fly problem. We had 2-3 circling our heads for the hour we were there."}
{"text":"I love this place for the carefully selected menu and the amazing cocktails. It deserves a lot more business."}
{"text":"We won't be back.  Pricey turkey cranberry sandwich sounded great---  BUT deli turkey, not roast turkey... really?  Cute space though...  wonder why no hand towels in the ladies room?  Just not the best...."}
{"text":"Where to start?

For the last 25 hours I have been riding my toilet like it was a shit covered race horse charging me through the gates of gastrointestinal Hell. 

Its now gotten so bad that the pyrotechnics in my ass have inspired me to changing show tunes into songs about what feels like giving rectal birth to a fire coated wet cappuccino machine, complete with foam and the associated noises that go with it.

One of the better ones I've come up with due to something going very, very wrong at Kitchen 56's kitchen was:

\"I feel shitty.
Oh so shitty. 
So shitty, and sharty and brown!!!
And I pitty any girl who isn't shitting her brains out today!\"

I think the writers of West Side Story would be proud of the spin-off that's spinning down the bowl of my toilet right now.

The only thing I ate yesterday was a burger, fries, slaw and an iced tea at Kitchen 56. 

My girlfriend had some of the same fries, the same slaw, and the same bun.

Since yesterday around 9pm to now, we've both been playing \"dueling bathrooms.\" Thank god we have two bathrooms, or someone would have had to use the bath tub.

So which of those four things was it? Or did someone just not  wash their hands in the kitchen after using the head? Either way, it wrecked my President's day.

And then there was the service. It was shitty too. Delivering the wrong meals to us, messing up the way the food was cooked and prepared, and forgetting about us for the first 20 minutes we were there.

All and all, even though its close to where we live, I won't be going back. One night of \"shitting myself skinny\" is enough. On the upside, this is the first burger that helped me to dropping 8 pounds over night. I think it was all out of my butt and from the sweats associated with the raw panic of going back into the toilet. When you're making deals with god, and are offering to give up your hedonistic ways, just because of one burger, its time to never, ever go back to wherever served it to you."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere with decent food. We sat in the bar section and was served by the bartender. He was super friendly, made excellent drinks (bloody beer, old fashion) and answered our questions about the menu with ease and sincerity. Had a nice enjoyable Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have no clue why this restaurant is 3.5 stars. It deserves a much higher rating. I had the pulled pork sandwich and the bacon cheddar mac and cheese with a Caesar salad. Everything was very fresh and the garlic fries had great flavor. I had the cookie for dessert. The server was very friendly and accommodating to our entree requests. I split everything with my wife. We will return!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for over a year but we used to come here almost every week. We were saddened to see how the menu changed. No longer have the Arcadia pizza or fish tacos; and changes made to the brussel sprout hash and calamari. 
The beet salad I ordered for over $13 was basically a bed of greens with a few beet slices, a few bites of goat cheese and a few bites of prosciutto (basically not enough of any of them to think they are actually part of the salad).
Our service was good. Getting drinks was slow but a large group of people came in right before us. 
Sadly, we won't be back which upsets us because we used to love this place."}
{"text":"I've only been here 6 months and I've seen this location be 3 different restaurants. I met a friend here for happy hour to check out this place and see if this one is gonna make it. 

The Cons: the space isn't used well. They need to make the bar area a lot bigger and use their space more wisely. There is a lot of floor and not enough chairs. They should also expand their local beer menu. I was sad the Four Peaks Peach had left.

The Pros: good happy hour menu, good food, unique specialty drink menu and an attentive staff.

The fish tacos were tasty and the black cherry lemonade was ok. Tacos, I love em. I think this place can make it. It had a crowd all night. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food great service and friendly staff. The other really great thing is the family friendly environment.  We had an age range of 2 - 60 and everyone felt welcome."}
{"text":"Fun decor on the inside, and a nice outdoor seating area as well (bonus - they have a ping pong table out there!). Word of warning: there was a bit of a funky smell while sitting outside, and we think it was the canal. If it's really hot out, maybe think twice about sitting outside because I'm sure the heat will intensify the smell. Or maybe it was just something in the air Saturday night. 

Anyway, on to the food! 

I knew I wanted to get dessert so I went lighter for my meal. I went with their Santa Fe Grilled Chicken Breast which came with a petite salad. Salad was mixed greens with tomatoes and red onions and a vinaigrette dressing. Basic, but tasty. There was two HUGE pieces of chicken that came with the meal, so I was impressed with the portion size. I ate one piece and was able to box up the other for another meal. 

For dessert I got their peanut butter and chocolate mousse. Yummy. Next time I want to try their sticky toffee pudding thing. 

My boyfriend got their tempura tofu with veggies and soba noodles. I took a bite and it was pretty good, and he liked it as well. He did say it was better after adding some Sriracha. 

Service was good though, and all around it was a good dining experience. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kitchen 56 for a couple of happy hours before and the experiences were probably about 3.5 star-worthy.  The outdoor patio is cute, the wine selection is decent, and the happy hour is better than the Vig's if you prefer wine over beer.  This solidly-decent streak was broken last night when seven of us showed up and were told there was no room for us on the patio.  Fine, we took a table in the dining room.  A manager stopped by to apologize for not being able to accomodate our desire to sit outdoors.  We forgave her.

Our waiter was surly, telling us he was the one who was \"forced\" to help us.  I get that it was a wry joke (maybe!) but there was zero humor behind it, and he seemed more genuine than not.  He then informed us that we did not \"qualify\" for happy hour because we were not seated at the bar or on the patio.  He was so unapologetic that I thought he was joking.  We asked if we could have the special anyway as we were there specifically FOR happy hour and had intended to sit outside if the few tables had not already been taken.  He disappeared to ask and returned with a solid N-O.  We decided that this would not stand, and walked out as multiple members of the waitstaff and the manager watched, expressionless.  Guess they had already made too much money that day and didn't have any more room for ours.

The dining room was empty, by the way.  WTF mate?  Seven of us could easily have racked that tab up to $200 in drinks alone, if only they had let us partake of their flimsy happy hour deals (which do not include food specials) for the one hour that was remaining of the special.  Real nice, Kitchen 56.  REAL NICE.

They really deserve one star for that as my previous experiences weren't exactly shining examples of service, but, unlike the staff at Kitchen 56, I am feeling a little generous today."}
{"text":"I think this place is newer, b/c they didn't quite seem to have the A+ service thing down quite yet.  Looks like they'll get there at some point, as they comped a portion of a friend's meal for bringing it out late.  

I'm an edamame nut - there's was done with a great little kick, or punch - heat, that is, but over olive oiled.  

Had the Turk burger, with small salad side.  Looked cool with the red and yellow bell peppers on it - the turkey burger that is...cooked fine, and tasted dyn-o-mite.  

So style and taste bonus points.  Salad was fresh with a nails mustard ving dressing?  Ok.

It's got a cool little atmosphere for a Happy Hour; great little wine bar off to the side. 
 
Recommend."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now since it is within  a few miles of where we live.  I finally was able to stop by and ordered the spaghetti and meatballs to go.
While waiting for the order, I sat at a very comfortable barstool and was able to check out the dining room and look at the dinner menu.  I found the place to be somewhat cold, it definitely needs some ambiance. I enjoy minimalist interiors as much as the next person, but a couple of fresh flowers on the tables would go a long way here.
When I returned home and opened my order, at first I thought they had made a mistake - the spaghetti looked like it was a children's order.  In addition, instead of the red marinara sauce I expected, the sauce was an orange color, like Chef Boyardee in a can. The pasta was the thick type of spaghetti, not the thinner, spaghettini type traditionally used in Italy,  and some sort of cheese was melted over it, also a no-no in traditional Italian kitchens. It tasted terrible - the pasta wasn't cooked al dente, it was overcooked and rubbery, the sauce had no taste and the tasteless cheese just made rubbery mess out of the whole dish. The meatballs were just okay, and again, they had the mystery cheese melted over them, which took away from their taste.
I am willing to give them another chance and would love to try some of the other pasta dishes, such as the papardelle with pork sauce,  but I would NOT recommend the spaghetti and meatballs to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I both grew up in the Arcadia area but now live out in North Scottsdale. We had driven by Kitchen 56 a few weeks back and decided to try it out. We arrived on Thursday the 30th of May during happy hour. The appetizers were really great and such a low price. We had fish tacos, short rib tacos and fish and chips. Really really good, the service was very good and the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. Just loved the place!"}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is absolutely fantastic. I have been there many times, and tonight was no exception. The owner was in and very personable, the bar staff was super pleasant and very attentive, and the food as always amazing. The advice to get are the chicken wings. They're fried and then grilled!!! Always need some extra time on the grill, so let your server know! Awesome place, great location, and great happy hour (3-6pm daily). Love this"}
{"text":"Was impressed with this restaurant to start with, but I think it is getting full of its self a bit -- each time we have gone back has been a little worse.  The patio is nice, but the time we sat there for lunch -- it was honestly swarming with flies. After about 20 minutes the waitress did bring out some candles, but it really killed it for me. We've had flies inside too-- makes me wonder whats going on in the kitchen.
THe food is good -- but I don't really think it is worth the price. Even with the view and location thrown in. 
The kicker for me, was last time we went, our family of four spent about 70 + but my child asked for half and half of  the children's sides (a little fruit and a few fries). Most places will do this-- fries are cheap and cantalope is like a dollar a bucket. But no-- they can't do that at 56 - you have to order extra. Then I see a statement on the menu \"If you liked your food, send a 6-pack of PBJs to the chefs for $10\"
So now I get to overpay for food, and tip for average service, and I'm encouraged to buy the chefs their after/during shift drinks???  
It feels like the owners are there to pat themselves on the back - not create a great dining experience for the customers..."}
{"text":"Cute place, unfortunately the worst food! Service was terrible even with two servers and a hostess and only two other small tables in the whole place besides us. Had to wait extremely long for empty drinks to be acknowledged and filled. Sat several times with empty drinks. On top of waiting forever for our food (which we could see sitting under heat lamp for ten plus minute) the food came out terrible. Most of it was cold, the burger smelled rotten, their fries were chewy (not crunchy) and everything lacked flavor. We waisted the majority of our terrible food and payed $50.00 for food that was not edible. (When we could finally get the server to acknowledge we had been waiting forever for our tab) never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a good time tonight. Our selection was cilantro wings and fries, virgin raspberry mojito,ginger beer with vodka cocktail and brownie ala mode. Would return."}
{"text":"Very limited menu for lunch but what they do prepare is delish. I had the smoke turkey and fried egg sandwich and my companion had the pulled pork. We both thought they were tasty. Very stylish inside and I would like to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Nice servers, cozy, friendly, nice patio, affordable prices, great neighborhood place.  Unfortunately, the food is not properly executed.  The kitchen staff needs to step it up, and be sure they are cooking the food to the correct temperatures as they are ordered.  Burgers overcooked, fried calamari like rubber bands, pizza crust doughy.  Sorry... we really do like the place but the food is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, alcohol, and service.  If that's all your looking for, then you've found a nice spot.  However, if you intend on eating I'd suggest you continue driving down the street to one of the many Scottsdale restaurants that will deliver a much better meal.  

We were part of a large party with a pre-ordered dinner, so perhaps this played into the quality....really hard to say.  Our grilled romaine salad tasted very reminiscent of those days when my father would douse the bbq with lighter fluid and then attempt to tell us later the flavor that was strangely burning our tongues was \"outdoor grilling at it's best\".  Sorry, but it didn't work for Dad and it didn't work last night either.  I thought that perhaps the salad was a fluke, but unfortunately the disappointment continued through the bland spaghetti-o like pasta and the easy bake oven version of dessert.  

If any of the food had displayed the slightest bit of potential, I would have been happy to give them another shot.  But life is short and there's too many other restaurants putting forth a much better effort."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and annoyed.  They're closed for remodeling.  I get that, but one would expect their voice mail to state that and not say, they're busy leave a message or reservation....  had plans with friends...went there...surprise-surprise....  too many other choices...bad management and planning to not plan and not state on your voice mail and telephone that you're closed for remodeling.  Not what I'd expect from Kitchen 56 restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great.  There is a relaxed feel in the restaurant with cozy booths and a good drink menu.  A nice variety of food too. Good service, must go back soon."}
{"text":"Hit. And. Miss.  The restaurant looks pretty cool at first glance but upon entering, it felt very cold and uninviting.  Nothing on the menu jumped out at me but I thought I would give it a shot anyways.  Our server was really friendly and helpful and made some nice suggestions for dinner.  We tried the Garlic and Cilantro wings for an appetizer and my boyfriend ordered the handmade Pappardelle pasta and I the Arugula and Fennel salad with grilled chicken.

The wings came out quickly but when the food runner brought them out he placed them on the table and immediately turned around without asking if we needed anything else.  Um...plates would have been nice.  I would think if your only job is running food to tables, you would be aware that side plates are necessary when you bring wings to a table.  We waited several minutes until the server returned from the back with plates.  

The wings tasted great, they were crispy with great flavor...until I bit all the way into them and noticed that they were way undercooked and still very pink.  Again, it took quite some time to even get the attention of anyone to alert them of the problem.  However, once we mentioned it, they quickly fired up a new order and brought them out, apologizing for the inconvenience.  I thought they handled the situation well (as the manager apologized and they comped two glasses of wine) so we brushed it off and enjoyed the new order of wings although they had overcompensated by practically burning the new order.

As for our entrees, we loved the Pappardelle pasta, it had great flavor and the slow roasted pork was amazing.  My salad, however, was probably the most boring, bland salad I have ever had.  It almost wasn't even worth eating.  I've had fennel in salads before and it normally adds a nice burst of flavor but the fennel was sliced so thinly that it added zero flavor and the sherry vinaigrette was equally as underwhelming.  

Overall, a very hit and miss experience.  I think this place has potential but needs some work as far as their back of the house operations.  The food was not executed well and the food runner clearly needed some training as each time he ran food to our table, he forgot to ask one very basic yet important question, \"Can I bring you anything else?\" 

Though we were not impressed, I still gave them 3 stars for the server and how they handled the wing situation.  I'm sure we will eventually give this place another shot once they have worked out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place today on a drive by. Looked so cool, was drawn in. Really a great spot and the food that we ordered was perfect. The service was super friendly, attentive and helpful (we are out of towners)...the owner and her daughter were fawning over our pooch which always scores major points for us."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying how utterly sad I am. We just left, about 10 minutes ago to go to chipotle, after getting our food... We have been die hard kitchen 56 patrons forever. Literally forever. We would go there every single weekend for the chilaquiles. Every weekend! We were so sad when they closed down for renovations. Let me tell you, these original chilaquiles were the absolute best food I've ever had in my entire life. Melt in your mouth. The green sauce, out of this world, and the potatoes, always seasoned to perfection. Well we get there and we are so excited, we get our \"go to chilaquiles\". I asked are they the same? The waiter's response: yes! Awesome! Well our meal finally comes to the table. The first thing we see, the three tortillas are all fully burned. Like black. We had to remove all of the edges. The cheese, different, laid on top, but it's not melted.... it's literally like they went in the fridge grabbed a piece of cheese and just threw it in top. Our eggs were both over hard ( I asked for over medium and my boyfriend asked for over easy). The green sauce is gone. It was just meat, and some pico sauce mixed together. Lastly, the potatoes which I was actually looking forward to, had absolutely no spices at all. Just grabbed out of the freezer and put in a pan. I'm just so sad. They didn't keep it the same. We broke our no carbs diet to come here, and it was not worth it . Please dear god bring back your original dish. No joke, it was the best food I've ever had. Why fix something that's not broken? Please! Please! Please! Bring it back!"}
{"text":"The burrata is not burrata, and the zeppoles are not zeppoles.  In addition to the inacurracy of the menu descriptions, both items were poorly executed.  The mozzarella masquerading as burrata was dry and tasteless and the stale, hard fried dough sticks were, um, stale and hard.  

Of the other four items we ordered none were exceptional.  The calamari was quite good, the mussels were overcooked and rubbery, and the pepperoni pizza was acceptable as was the arugula salad.

Service was also lacking, with three different waitstaff involved in getting us our food late.  Overall disappointing."}
{"text":"I had been here for lunch a couple times, it was always great. This most recent was first time at dinner, i was so disappointed. The bartender was our wait person, he said the chicken was so tender uou could cut with a fork. I say only if there is a saber on the end of your fork. I shared my dissappointment woth him. He made no effort to correct. I under stand sometimes things get messed up. But i wish he had taken the initiative to correct. Bummer experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on a double-date here with some friends last week.  My first impression was that the place was cute and I liked what they did with the space.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and the overall feel was great.

The food is a different story:(  We started with the onion straws app which was decent.  I ordered the mac and cheese that came with a petit salad, my girlfriend ordered a tofu dish, and our friends ordered a steak special and a sandwich.  The steak which was ordered well (I know, I cringed, too) came out rare, the vinaigrette on my salad tasted rotten, the mac and cheese was middle of the road...I've had better and worse.  My girlfriend enjoyed her tofu and our friend said her sandwich was pretty good.  My green tea adult lemonade was fantastic!  The best part of my meal for sure!  When we ordered dessert I chose the creme brulee.  I sunk my spoon in and it just dripped off...ew!!! Creme brulee is supposed to be a custard-like consistency...it was definitely not set.  I was super bummed.  I would go back, because I totally believe in second chances...but with so many good restaurants out there...they better step it up!!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Our waiter was super friendly. I had the burger and my girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich (couldn't resist we could smell it when we came in) and they were both spectacular. The vibe was awesome we were dancing in our seats to the music the whole time. Awesome atmosphere as well. All around recommend Kitchen 56!"}
{"text":"My favorite canal restaurant. The menu is very inventive although they have no problem charging for their food and cocktails. All their specialty drinks are very tasty (the Black Cherry Lemonade is awesome) but expensive. The views are great the place feels very comfortable inside, a great bar and good tables. I really watch what I eat and Kitchen 56 has some great menu options for low carb low fat items. They even have some vegetarian choices which is always nice to see. 
While the prices are high I believe I get good value for my money. I am not going to go here to drink all day but stopping in during a bike ride on the canal is great (they do give a 10% discount for bike riders)."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!  Great Tacos, our server/bartender \"Steve\" took great care of us.

I liked the chicken over the short ribs.  And I like short ribs, but the aoli on the chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"The host was very prompt and pleasant. We asked to sit at a high top in the bar and she quickly got us waters. Our server stopped by and explained the wood fire grill. I ordered the steak firebread - she asked how I wanted it cooked - I said Med-rare. It came out medium but was still delicious. I love that they make their bread in house! My friend ordered the green chili mac with chicken, it was amazing. It always bothers me when servers don't do two minute check backs after they drop off our food to see if we need anything. I was out of water and luckily the hostess walked by to take care of us. Also our food took way too long especially for lunch. We will be back for the food and give them an opportunity to step up their service."}
{"text":"It was kinda late for brunch, around 1:30 ish. My friends and I had a long Saturday night and a lazy Sunday morning but we still wanted brunch. Now you can't have brunch without mimosas rights?? 
The minute we got there we all ordered 1 mimosa ($6 bucks). We looked over the menu over and over and over again because we were so damn hungry but nothing stood out to us. Nothing! And it was only about 6 or 7 brunch items on the menu maybe. 

With that being said we asked for or checks for or 1 drink and carried he party over to OSHO"}
{"text":"I'm willing to go ahead with 3 stars here, and since I will likely come back again, will gladly update this next time... but this is based on my initial impression from Valentine's Day dinner.  

I was able to snag a table here on Valentine's day via opentable.com. Unfortunately due to my partner being in the hospital the night prior, I had to wait till the last minute to make sure that we were even going to be able to go at all that night.  Gladly we were able to, and given the menu options, I was glad to find a place that we were both able to enjoy.

We arrived about 5 minutes before our scheduled reservation time, and were seated right away.  We were brought to a table on the outdoor patio, which I'm sure was lovely, however, due to my partner's breathing issues, we had to ask to be seated indoors instead.  The host gladly moved us to an indoor table right away, which was appreciated.

Although we were very appreciative that the restaurant let us know right away that there was a delay in the kitchen, we really weren't sure why that was, considering the restaurant wasn't all that crowded.  Given that however, while we did receive our appetizer fairly quickly, the chicken wings were under cooked, and in some cases, partially raw.  Once our entrees arrived, they were luke warm at best. At this point we had been there over an hour, and my partner was not feeling well, so we chose to eat and leave rather than send the food back to be heated up (which would probably have been done by microwave). 

I did enjoy the menu, and we were very interested about their new brunch menu, however, My suggestion would definitely be to keep patrons posted throughout their time there.  Although we were told when we came in, we felt that no one really kept us posted about anything, and then to have luke warm food, makes me think that it was just sitting there for who-knows-how-long until it was finally picked up and brought to us."}
{"text":"A year ago I would been very impressed witha place like this, but even if it is nice.. the space is a little odd, and this type of establishments are a dimje a dozen at this time. This doesn't mean this place is any lesser - it just mean this place might have to step it up to maintin the excellence that it wants to uphold.

I came here as a mingler (is that a word?) and for that purpose the space is far from optimal. Then add a musician that is ok, but way too loud for the space.. which made it incredibly hard to maintain a conversation. Music at this time is background, not the main event. 

Service was awesome though.. a couple of waiters served a group of people that was moving about, and still got every order (to my knowleedge) right - thats impressive. I had some house rum drink that didn't exactly knock my socks off, but then again I consider myself a bit of a rum cognoscente and after that drink I switched to a more low key drink.

I would go back, but maybe not for Happy Hour.. but then again, they might work on it. The atmosphere is nice enough though."}
{"text":"Frequent patron here... Great bar, great service can dine in or take out. Fresh tuna sushi and steaks. Arcadia salad is great."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and food what more can you ask for!   Outdoor area is amazing! Have been here several times and will always come back - great for an adult atmosphere or family one as well"}
{"text":"The whole family's favorite restaurant (kids 12-18). Very cool to think about the restaurant once being a service station. Very comfortable, friendly staff, perfect noise level, and extremely accommodating! 

All 5 of us ordered something different. Cheddar Mac and cheese was tasty. Baked potato was giant and came with more than enough toppings, including pulled pork. I heard the classic pizza was good, but I didn't try it bc my daughter added mushrooms (I am not a mushroom eater). The lemon chicken that looked good in front of another customer  proved itself very good for my entree (sans mushrooms). And my husband asked the chef to create a pizza with BBQ sauce (no tomato), fresh mozzarella, pulled pork and onion straws. It was delicious! Even our server commented on how good it looked! 

The topper was when the server brought out a special birthday dessert for my daughter without singing! She loved it without being too embarrassed! We are in AZ only a few times a year, but we will definitely be eating at Kitchen 56 each time. We can't wait to dine outside there too. We highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service for the 3rd time at the bar..old chicken wings chewy and chewy calamari. bartenders there are rude and indifferent. Never again"}
{"text":"Great place. Really come into its own. It started out slow. But has really developed into a great neighborhood place. Nice and easy for families. Great starters. Easy and comfortable service. Comfy seats..... What're could you ask for."}
{"text":"They were out if the appetizer we ordered \"Chios & dip\" and had been for a week according to our server...the food, pizza, wasn't worth the wait. Won't come back"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood restaurant in Arcadia.  Small menu, great prices, and the perfect warm weather cocktail coolers.  Sit out on the patio and bring your dog for brunch or lunch or enjoy the great happy menu - my wife loves the tacos.  We come here often and consider it our old standby.  Parking can be difficult, but beyond that, a great place."}
{"text":"I pine for the glory days of Kitchen 56 - the happy hours that were the stuff of legend, when a fiver would buy you a dozen of the best wings in the Valley, a Martini that was really just a cup of ice-cold vodka with some stuffed olives, or a heaping plate of fish tacos. The late afternoons when I'd walk over with some coworkers, eat like a king, and gaze at Camelback Mountain looming a stone's throw away (well, a few throws at any rate), and wonder whether all things this good must sooner or later come to an end.

The beginning of the end was the new menu, a little slimmed down and marked by the only price increase that even I found as cute and endearing as it was necessary and irksome: 56 cents. $5.00 became $5.56, $10.00 became - you guessed it - $10.56. I admired their ingenious way of keeping up with inflation, but since then, the menu's undergone a few more drafts, the dozen wings became eight (I think?), a couple of my favorite waiters have moved on, and Kitchen 56 has slipped a little. I still whole-heartedly recommend it for the great patio, spectacular view, casual American fare, fun cocktails, and a few good beer choices. But I hope they find a way to become, once again, what they were for a brief Golden Age: hands-down, the best happy-hour joint in town.

In the meantime, though, go for their pizzas, wings (still absolutely delicious, even if not an incredible value anymore), Kitchen Sink Burger, and anything with Ahi. I'd definitely recommend their lunch and dinner over their brunch (not bad, but there are a half-dozen better brunches in the area). As for cocktails, the Moscow Mule, 56 Martini, Backporch Lemonade, and Elderflower Champagne... heck, they're all delicious!"}
{"text":"My first time here and the food was great!  We had a little issue and Jessika and the manager took great care of us to get it solved.  I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I met a few friends there for a casual dinner and it was perfect. I've driven by this place 100 times and was excited to finally check it out! It's cute and simple inside, nothing over the top or super fancy. We started with the pork corn cakes which were delicious. The sauce had a little kick to it, which was was a nice surprise. We also split the bbq pizza and the baked potato. The pizza wasn't anything to write home about, but the potato was delicious! Smothered with more bbq pulled pork and cheese, it was delicious. 

If you're looking for a cute place to grab a casual dinner this is a great place! All the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and is affordable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 what can i say,
Decent food large portions on the sandwiches,
However on the burger the buns could be better
The staff is always friendly if not shorthanded 
Which happens most of the time 
The location of kitchen 56 used to be an old Humble Gas station
And the proprietors of kitchen 56 have done a good job of preserving the old service bays
In side you will  walk in to a artfully decorated establishment, your gaze everywhere from the black and white photos to the wall of fire wood.
A very cool place with a decent happy hour, and good drinks the bartenders know what they are doing.
For all the shorthandeness the staff is very acomadating 
But it can take time to find some aid"}
{"text":"Great place in heart of Arcadia!  Nice staff,great american food, and awesome location.  Love this place I go here about 3 times a month.  CHECK IT OUT"}
{"text":"Okay it is time fore a quick review.  Just the facts mam.  
I was with my better half and my niece on Saturday.  My better half ordered the hamburger and fries.  She gave it the thumbs up.  My niece ordered the bowl of soup.  It had chicken and mushrooms.  She gave it the two thumbs up too.  I ordered the pork chop.  It was good.  It came with mashed potatoes and a assortment of veggies.  I gave it two thumbs up too.  We did have the pretzels with beer cheese as a appetizer too.  It was good.  I wish the size of the pretzels were a bit larger though.  It was good though.  I do not drink that much anymore.  Did enough for two lifetimes in my twenties.  They have a cool looking drink mixes on the wall too.  I will eventually try the pink panther drink.  I like this place it was our third time here.  It is a drive from where we live.  If we were closer this would be a once a week place."}
{"text":"We've dined here before, so we were surprised with the quality of the food was for this meal.  First, service, staff, and the facility are all A+ - we did not have any alcolol, so we can't judge the bar. The food was flavorless.  We had ordered appetizers and decided not to order dinner once we tried the potato skins and tacos.  We ordered one more app, the chicken tacos, and they we cold and flavorless as well. Our son was hungry, so we ordered the burger (medium well) and it came out just short of mooing."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is my new favorite restaurant! Held my birthday party dinner on the patio with a large group of family and friends last night. The food was amazing and Nicole is a wonderful server, effortlessly keeping up with our many orders and special requests. This restaurant luckily reopened a few months ago, and is really hitting the groove with a chic atmosphere and multiple unique seating areas. Thank you to co-owner Andy, manager Ted, and staff for making it a fun and memorable evening! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  Had lunch here today and was delighted. Arcadia salad with grilled salmon. The salmon was a delicious add on. Salad was very good with light lemon vinaigrette. I will order again!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place!   I come in about once a month with my parents who live in the area.  The place is cute.   Super comfy bar stools & high tops!   The most amazing chalkboard as a focal point.  Nice patio and open air bar.  Not sure what the food/vibe they are gong for... Local bar? Cafe? Restaurant? Awesome cocktails!  Odd mix of food and a slightly limited menu... But I still dig it and want to really like it! 

The service is a little choppy but they are really nice.. Always! 

The pizza is amazing!  Like really really good.   But I always try something else... Pot pie was underwhelming and lacking enough meat, Caesar salad was solid, Cobb salad was good but the turkey was just sliced deli turkey piled on top (presentation?).  Green chile mac was awesome! Wings were different and cooked well.   I ordered the brussel sprouts hash.  And this is a dish I make at home and love... And I was pretty disappointed with this one.   So much garlic it was actually spicy, I could see the red onions but couldn't taste them over the garlic.   And I love garlic but this was a clear miss.  Bummer.   Please chef!  Taste your food!  Think browned butter and bacon with the shaved sprouts!   Think less garlic..."}
{"text":"Great local spot!  Kitchen 56 is a friendly warm neighborhood bar/restaurant. I love their appetizers and selection of beers on tap!  Highly recommend this place, stop and say hi to Ted, he's great!"}
{"text":"1st time here and I am really glad I stopped in.  First off, you have amazing views of Camelback mountain.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice glass of their house Zin with my fig and prosciutto wood fired pizza.  It was delicious. There was a guy on guitar singing there as well and he was good and made it lively.  The service was great, very cool vibe and I'll definitely be back! They have a patio on the side but since it's too hot nobody was out there but sure it'll be packed when weather gets nicer! 

I'd definitely recommend this place to others to check out!"}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times and have had good experiences each time. The food always tastes fresh and they change up their menu so it's nice to try new entres. I prefer to go during the slow hours because it does get busy."}
{"text":"Accidently missed a turn to go to the Arcadia tavern..ended up here Cuz it looked like a relaxing place. Low and behold it's a hidden gem. I enjoyed the ambience and the relaxing patio. Will come again definitely!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a gas station and the building was re-purposed as one of the better eateries on the East Indian School row of restaurants. I've been here for lunch and dinner and the service is always great. The burgers could very well be the best I've ever had. Of course any burger is great when you have a heaping mountain of bacon on it! We have frequent guests that fly in from France for work and we always bring them here after we pick them up from the airport. If the French guys say the food is good it must be great! There's usually a local guy playing covers with his guitar and the outdoor patio has a ping pong table that's fun to burn off some of that bacon."}
{"text":"I have been passing this place since I moved into the valley, so the other day my girlfriend and I wanted to go out and grab something to eat so I figured it would be a good time to try a new place. We looked up the menu online and everything sounded amazing and was prices well. The bartender was also our server and recommended some good dishes, he was very nice and knowledgable about the menu. I would definitely go back to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Took a walk today along the canal and found this restaurant.  It was pretty good.  I had a proscutto and fig panini with fries.  It was pretty good.  They also have happy hour all day on Sunday for drinks only.  Food specials start later in the afternoon."}
{"text":"What can I say but awesomeness about this place.

Had a table of 6, as we normal sit at the bar area, wings, wings, wings are the Best thing on the menu. If you get them trust me they won't let you down.

This place os like a home away from home and love visiting when ever I'm in town.

My fiancée and I came back on Sunday for a carry out of the wings.....This place rocks even with the carry out orders. Don't sleep on K56, you can even bring your 4 legged friends on the patio while wnjoying the Fall weather."}
{"text":"I love the history of this building.  The huge photo in the dining room shows the building when it was used as a gas station.  I was expecting a lot from the food and drink and was a little disappointed.  

The edamame is amazing.  Splashed with a soy-oyster sauce mix, it was huge enough for four people to share.  The salad I ordered was fine.  Nothing to gush about.  My companions, including one picky kid, LOVED their burgers and omelets.  The fries were undercooked, cold inside and inedible.

The \"adult lemonade\" drinks sounded interesting, but the one I ordered (cucumber-basil) was so horrible I could barely take more than a few sips before abandoning it.  My companion also ordered one, a different flavor, and agreed that it was not good.

Despite the history of the building, the food was bland and uninspiring."}
{"text":"Our server was great!  The place looks fun as you drive by. 

However, when you walk inside it's bright lights create an odd ambience.  Perhaps I'm used to nicer more upscale places and also funky dives, but this falls in the middle. Kind of like Applebee's without the charm - sarcasm. I think the interior is terrible and nondescript.  

Our martinis were over priced and served tepid. We had expressly asked for them to be ice cold and our server acted as if she knew what we meant. The bartender obviously doesn't drink martinis. Never order a mixed drink in a family restaurant!!!!!

The hamburgers were fine but nothing special. The French fries were the best part of the meal. Couldn't wait to leave - will never return. The pizza at the next table looked good."}
{"text":"I normally don't bother writing anything when I'm not happy about an experience, but this is necessary. For starters, the service was atrocious. We waited two hours for our meals and the manager never bothered to come talk to us. I had to chase her down three times. When the food came, my chicken was still cold and raw, my wife got sick from her salmon. They forgot half of our meals and had nothing to say except \"I don't know what's going on\". I wouldn't eat there again if it was free. Sad because it's in my hood. Everyone was excited, but the reviews from friends match mine.  My guess is that it won't survive the summer."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been back to Kitchen 56 several times as it is local but it keeps disappointing. The service is great and the drinks are well made but the food is well below par and leaves a lot to be desired. The burgers and pizzas are ok but anything over and above this that requires a little more cooking skill is average at best. The pot pie is completely lacking in flavor and the short rib tastes like it comes out a package. We'll maybe stop in for a drink again but will seek food elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Once again we begrudgingly go to 56 since the decline of their food but we go bc the kids love it and we walk to an empty restaurant and we're told they have an hour wait. With a ton of available tables- and yet open table tells me I can get a table in 10 mins. This has happened the last two times we have gone. So done with here."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot across the board!  Excellent service, delicious food with ample portions and overall cool ambiance!  

From the host stand to the servers to the bartenders to the manager on staff, everyone was delightful, helpful and accommodating without being pushy, annoying or interrupting our convo.

Amazing happy hour menu, lovely craft beers on tap, extensive wine list and they make a mean martini!

I love the adaptive re-use of an old service station and how that's incorporated into the overall vibe of the place and the retro brand.  Great job there, Kitchen 56!

Next time I'm I must try their famous burgers (my table-mates raved like religious zealots over them!) and I need to check out the patio for some solid \"hang out\" time. I mean, that's why we live in the desert, right?

I'll definitely be back and with a pack of friends!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome - cool location and history, and really unique and delicious food. Our server was great and we had no wait or any issues at all. I can't wait to come back when it's cooler out to sit and drink on the outdoor patio. 

I had the Arcadia salad and others in my party had pizzas. We all ordered unique drinks and everyone was pleased. 

This place is a very cool find on the Phx/Scottsdale border that definitely satisfies anyone looking for great food and a non-chain atmosphere."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 became my new regular spot once I found it.  I often drove by, but had some other regular watering holes and never stopped in.  One night I went with some girl friends and never looked back! 

I lived in Boise Idaho for several years, and brand 44 North Huckleberry vodka was local to Idaho.  I searched high and low for bars in Phoenix that had 44 North and i was absolutely delighted when I found it on the menu of Kitchen 56! 

I can not recommend their happy hour enough. Smokin deals - 5 street tacos for $5.56? YES PLEASE.  I also ALWAYS ordered their Brussels spout hash.  My favorite meals were by far the Ahi Tuna entree and the Short Ribs.  The burgers/sandwiches were mediocre, so stay away from those if you are looking for a true food experience.

I give only 4 stars because occasionally their service was lacking, often as a result of being short staffed.  And while their menu had stellar stand outs in my opinion, some items were a little lacking. Ted, the general manager, was great and made sure folks were enjoying their experience.  

I would definitely recommend this place over the other local eateries that were often over crowded.  The live music on Sundays and Wednesdays was also a great touch!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, there wasn't much to choose from (very small lunch menu)  and when we did get a salad and sandwich (30 min later)  to share, both of us were very disappointed with the amount of food that we received and it was COLD! (panini and fries). Only giving this place a 2 because of its ambiance...."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, but the service and food are both good. I just wish there were more options. I was cornered into a salad, which was great, but the bowls are weird and make it hard not to get your lettuce all over your table."}
{"text":"Service was bad but the food was worse. I was so optimistic after the remodel that some things would change but now they are understaffed, way behind with the food, and it was cold."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. I got a Moscow mule and it was the best one I've ever had! I got an Arcadia salad and it was so yummy! I wish that prices were a little bit better- I wanted to add chicken to my salad but it would have been $4 more. I didn't feel like paying $15 for a salad. Bur other than that, I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830. 
My experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1.
Next our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead.
Lissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3.
My companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4.
My tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5.
Next up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6.
Not even done yet......
At 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes \"when the party is over.\"  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7.
She finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting.
At 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8. 
 I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9
When Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10.
Furthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, \"Ok they took a dollar off.\"  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11.
I am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes kitchen 56 has finally reopened with a brand new elegant look and the same exquisite food. Went there yesterday had the best burger in town  and the French fries are to die for, the icing on the cake is that my favourite waiter has opened back up with them, Alex you are the best , You give impeccable service and make the whole experience of kitchen 56 fun , can't wait to go back and would recommend this great place to everyone ."}
{"text":"Awesome place.   Nice waitstaff.   We started off with the chips and dip, so good.   Followed with two burgers.    Very delicious.  We will definitely be visiting again... And again.  :)"}
{"text":"Just OK- food isn't great but isn't terrible. Not my favorite place in this part of town."}
{"text":"Was really wanting to love this place but was disappointed.  Ordered the blue cheese crusted steak and the meat was so tough it was inedible. The steak seemed to have been cooked a bit more rare than medium so I was surprised the meat was as tough as a shoe.  Our waiter was great and replaced it with a burger and although not bad it wasn't anything special. 

They have a very limited dinner menu, the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night so not much of an ambiance.  

Their fries were delicious and customer service was good. The cocktail menu seemed original, but I wasn't able to drink that night. Maybe I'd go back just to try drinks, but not interested in eating there again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the the staff and our  server Sydney are exceptional they are so friendly and nice, but something has happened to this place. The food has just gone done. Not sure if theirs a new chef or new owners. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"This place is really sweet. Went in on a Sunday before I had to get to work and my salad came out almost immediately. Almost passed it by but noticed the parking lot was full. The bartenders name is Mike and he gave awesome service! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I sort of hate to give a lukewarm review to, because they are trying hard and people have clearly put a lot of work into making the restaurant nice...but the food is mediocre and it's sort of on the pricey side. I came here for a work lunch and the place was on the quieter side, so that's good. I ordered the veggie sandwich ($12.56) and it was just a bad grilled cheese. The chipotle aioli didn't taste very good (and I like chipotle cream sauces) and there was so much of it that the sandwich bread slid around. The cheese wasn't very good. The vegetables in it were fine but nothing too exciting. The person I was eating with got the steak salad and I thought the salad size was...small. Too small to make a lunch of.

Overall, I think it's just a little too expensive for what you get especially since there are so many great restaurants that are also pricey but have yummier food for me in the area. But the restaurant area is nice and it probably would be fun for happy hour."}
{"text":"Bomb HH! Was pleasantly surprised. Nice dog friendly patio, friendly service, and yummy appetizers and drinks at happy hour. We will definitely be back! Get the calamari and the chicken tacos. Oh and the edamame for a veggie."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for quite some time, but previous reviews weren't exactly motivating. We went for dinner on a Thursday night and we were immediately seated by a friendly hostess. The decor is really nice inside and fits their overall theme well. We started with some drinks. I had the jalapeño margarita and my wife had a bourbon/apple cocktail, and both were great. For dinner, I ordered the green chili burger with fries, and it was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. My wife ordered the kale salad and really enjoyed it as well. We will definitely be back to try some of the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday with our dogs and it was perfect! Staff was attentive and didn't give us a hassle about asking to move into the shade. They even brought out extra water for the pups. 

Onion dip was spot on as well as the burgers! I love a good Bloody Mary which could have had a little spice to it but overall satisfied with our visit!"}
{"text":"Food...ambiance...service...parking...price...EVERYTHING DOUBLE GREAT.  Loved it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ben coming here for years.........service going down hill.............food only OK.............great bartender..............."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to celebrate a work friend's \"workiversary.\" The patio is very enjoyable, large, and sunny. We arrived near noon and the place wasn't very busy. However, it seemed to take a long time to get our drinks and place our order. I believe that there was only 1 server taking all the orders for our group of 10, which did not seem to scream \"good planning.\" But, our server kept her cool and didn't show her frustration when one of my party pulled the \"high maintenance\" card out and requested several variations to her lunch selection. Kudos to you, cool headed server! 

My veggie sandwich was ok. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The veggies were fresh enough, but the overall impression was rather bland. The fries, though, were great. My colleagues appeared to enjoy their selections, so perhaps only the veggie sandwich needed a flavor boost.

I'd check out Kitchen 56 again to see what their other menu selections are like. I really like the patio and can see myself enjoying happy hour."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio, great happy hour, walking distance from our house, great service, and delicious eats + drinks? Yes, please! Kitchen 56 is a major winner in my book! The service is always very friendly and attentive! From 3-6 PM on weekdays they have a variety of $5.56 eats and drinks! 

I ordered their kale + quinoa salad for lunch {add chicken} and it was incredible! It was a VERY hearty salad and I was super full by the end of it! It is hard to find a good, hunger satisfying salad these days and Kitchen 56 definitely does not disappoint!

The fiance had the green chili burger and loved it, but I loved the hand-cut fries even more!!! They were so yum {sorry Ben P. for stealing most of them!}. ;) He secretly orders fries because he knows I love them {insert awwwwwww here}. 

We'll be back to this fab restaurant in the 'hood very soon! Thanks for always being so great! Harvey {our sheepdog} loves the treats and cozy patio as well!"}
{"text":"Arrived and waited a long time for our lunch and the place was not even full.  So for Mac and Cheese which was ok, the green chili burger and fries, dessert and one drink with tip...$38!!!  All I can say is that there is no way my lunch was worth that much money. The place is very nicely decorated, parking can be a pain, but the food was not something special."}
{"text":"Go here. Get a pizza and their loaded baked potato. You can die happily after."}
{"text":"First visit was a Friday \"Really Happy Hour\". $5.56 for the best adult lemonade in Phoenix! The Back Porch and Green Tea Lemonades were perfection. 

The homemade chips and summer salsa(also $5.56) was a perfect compliment to the lemonade."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is a neighborhood restaurant with a full bar located in the Arcadia area of Phoenix.  It came highly recommended to me by some of my neighbors.  My first impression upon walking into the restaurant was very good.  I love the casual, clean décor and the place just has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  I was greeted immediately and was seated without delay. I was there for a late brunch or lunch on a Sunday. The place was not busy at all.  There were a couple of people at the bar and two other tables inside were occupied.  I know they have a patio but I did not venture so I don't know how many people were there but there were not many cars in the parking lot.

My waiter came over and took my drink order within a couple of minutes of me being seated and then took my brunch order when he brought my drink.  He was pleasant, had the expected smile however, he never introduced himself so I have no idea what his name is.

I ordered the ginger spritzer for a drink and the three cheese & basil omelet with fruit and potatoes for my brunch order. The order took a little longer then I would expect for an omelet on a not-so-busy day but I took that as a good sign thinking the chef was just preparing everything fresh and with care. 

After the waiter delivered my food, he was never to be seen again!  I was also wrong about the expected quality of the omelet.  This was probably the most poorly prepared omelet I have ever had.  Even one of those breakfast-chain restaurants does a better job.  The omelet was over-cooked, there was no sign of any basil in the omelet and it was extremely salty.  The fruit consisted of a dry orange wedge and one average strawberry.  I did find the basil, it was on the potatoes which were also too salty but otherwise cooked well.

I thought about complaining and probably should have.  But I figured my waiter would stop by soon to ask if everything was okay. No waiter.  After several minutes the owner stopped by and asked, my reply was \"Do you really want to know?\" I told her it was salty and there was no basil in the omelet.  She went back to the kitchen and then offered a free desert which I declined. She then offered to re-make the omelet but I declined that also as I was short on time.

I have to say, she was very apologetic, sincere and pleasant to talk with.  Based solely on her pleasantness and attitude along with my neighbor's recommendation, I will give this place a second chance but there are some obvious issues that she must resolve with her wait and cook staff.  It's a shame that this happened at a restaurant with SO MUCH potential in an up-scale neighborhood. It is these kinds of things that will make or break an independent, neighborhood restaurant.

My check was presented to me by the owner (again, not the waiter) and she only charged me for my drink.  I was grateful and told her she really didn't need to comp the food, so I paid for the drink and about  1/2 of what the omelet should have been. I will go back sometime although Kitchen 56 is not on my priority list right now.  I will hope for better service and food up to the standards of such a nice place."}
{"text":"I wish the food was better because the location is great...unfortunately both the food and drinks are overpriced and just mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews -- mediocre and underwhelming. The wine choices are bottom shelf and overpriced. They serve the wine at warmer than room temp as well. The food is just okay, but not worth the trip. There are much better options a little further west on Indian School."}
{"text":"We're off to a good start. Skin-on fries and a Philly Cheese Steak for my first visit."}
{"text":"Meh! =I 
Totally neutral is how I left Kitchen 56.  We arrived with reservations and were promptly sat at a high top table in the middle of the restaurant. I was surprised to see It was pretty busy for 8PM on a Friday.  Our server greeted us very briefly and took Hottie's drink order (I wanted to look over the menu) and then left. He seemed pretty frazzled.  About 5 minutes later our drinks were dropped off by someone else, who did not ask if we needed anything.  Another 5 Minutes pass and a female server comes to our table and asks if we are ready to order. No, \"Hi my name is\"... \"let me tell you about the menu\", nothing!  I told her I would like to order a drink and she seemed annoyed, like I was being rude.  She took my drink order and our appetizer order and left.  

We started with the Onion straws, a little greasy but overall pretty tasty especially because the sauce was fantastic.  For my cocktail I had a Maple Manhattan, which was so delicious one of the best Manhattan's I've had.  

 For dinner I ordered their tofu and vegetable stir fry with Soba Noodles. This had received good reviews from fellow yelpers so I was excited to try it.  I was greatly disappointed. The noodles were over cooked, it had no flavor except ginger and there were no vegetables in it except red cabbage.  I never send anything back, but I did. This of course took about 10 minutes, because our server never came back to check on us. I flagged down a manager and she suggested the green chili macaroni.  By the time this came out, Hottie had already finished his meal and his plate had been taken. This kind of kills the dining experience.  When the macaroni came out, it was much better, great flavor and just the right amount of creaminess and spice. Again the noodles were a little over cooked; they were breaking apart, but still edible. 

Overall, the service was pretty poor, but being a former Server I could tell that they were all \"In the weeds\" so I gave her a break, and still left a 30% tip.  The food was good, but not great.  I think I would try Kitchen 56 again under the right circumstances, but with so many other options in the area, it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Decent enough food.   Although the edamame alone is worth the trip.   That was really the standout for me.    The cocktail menu is varied and great.  Love the cucumber mule.  The waitstaff was excellent and very knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a casual dinner last night and ordered the calamari to start ($8) it was coated in a peanut slaw eh wasn't quite my thing. I m not into foods overly sauced. I would pick something diff next time. I opted for the Arcadia salad- mixed greens with cranberries and pecans with a citrus vinaigrette. I added chix for protein. It was very clean, fresh and exactly what I wanted. The menu is simple from pastas, pizzas, burgers, salads. i would go back and check it out again but wouldn't recc to drive here if you dint live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was our third time here. Our first experience was great- that was last summer. Our second experience was last fall. I had asked if I could substitute the French fries that came on the side of my steak for a different vegetable. The server said I could only sub a salad, which was already the second side that came with the dish at the time. While I like salads, if I wanted that much I would have ordered a salad. 
We went again tonight in the hopes that things would have improved. We made a reservation on Open Table. The hostess said they had reserved a table in the bar. Really? I asked if we could sit In the dining room instead. At least she said alright because the bar was quite noisy. 
We ordered calamari to start. Then when it came to entrees I got the short ribs and my boyfriend got the baby back ribs. The calamari took a long time to come out. The table behind us got really quick, friendly service. When the entrees came out, all of our sides were mixed up. The runner asked if that was OK. Really? Um...no. He should have offered to re-plate it in the kitchen. Instead, we had to swap stuff around at the table, which was messy. I mean, who wants to try to scoop mashed potatoes to a different play with a fork and knife? Then our server came by and asked if everything was OK. We said that they screwed up the plates and she proceeded to show us her ticket where she wrote it down right, and blamed the kitchen. Still, no apology or anything. 
To top it off, the table behind us got a free dessert from their server just for being flirty. Not that I wanted a free dessert. All I wanted was some customer service. 
And there was a fly that simply wouldn't leave us alone once our food came. 
Sorry, I'm going to give this place a pass next time it is suggested. There are better places in the area. 
Oh yeah- that reservation we made on Open Table? It was cancelled by the restaurant after we left. Guess I won't be getting those points. Thanks, but no thanks, Kitchen 56."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56! How have I managed to miss this little gem? Loved it! Started with the chips and onion dip, a classic, paper thin, fresh chips and creamy onion dip, what's not to love? Our party ordered the pulled pork sandwich, burger deluxe, and the arugula and fennel salad, all excellent and prepared to perfection. HAD to order the brussel sprout hash, as I love brussel sprouts, and figured it would either be very bad or very good...delightfully, it was the latter! Fresh and savory, a perfect side. For desert we order several to sample, creme brûlée with fig reduction, deep fried banana split (was that homemade ice cream?) and made to order zeppoles with sugar and cinnamon. Phenomenal. Start to finish it was a great night. David was our server and he was fabulous, I'm a stickler for good service, it can make or break a restaurant for me, and he was impressive. I will absolutely be back, can't believe it has taken me so long to make it in!"}
{"text":"I love places that adventure with basics. It's like planning a camping trip and instead of packing a cot, you managed to get a massaging bed up the mountain. Ok real terrible analogy, but basically, the traditional method works and does the job, but sometimes you want a little more. 

This place had great ideas, but I just didn't love it. I ordered the pretzels for an app, with the beer cheese. The pretzels were loaves, which I should have guessed meant they weren't the super chewy things I love to eat. Not to say they were bad, but just ok. The cheese sauce I did totally love though, and I may or may not have licked that bowl clean. Discreetly of course. 

I also ordered a side of brussel sprout hash and while the texture and the cooking process of these delightful veggies was spot on, they needed something else. Some pizazz. They underwhelmed me, which was sad. 

For our entree, we got the steak and blue cheese pizza. Again, great idea, less than amazing execution. I couldn't taste any blue cheese at all. None. Nada. And it really needed that zip. Without the tang it was kinda like a quesadilla with a sprinkle of steak and mushrooms. I didn't get the garlic taste at all either and to continue there is maybe a light smattering of steak on this thing, so if you are feeling meaty skip it. The mushrooms do help on that department, but not enough. The crust was good, I did like that.

And lastly, I got a raspberry mojito. I love love love mojitos, so refreshing and not too sweet. Well this one was sour. Whew. It had real raspberries (not sure if fresh or frozen) which were mega tart. It was palatable but a little tough to enjoy wholeheartedly. 

The atmosphere was great. I love that. I love the visit and story and the service was great. Just a little more love on the food. I want to taste that extra bit."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  Came in for breakfast on a Saturday, patio was filthy.  Only one other table, server took forever, please don't make us come find you!

Some lady brought her dog and a huge blanket that she shaked and spread out for the dog.  Maybe consider a separate patio?  We didn't care for the dog hair all over us and our food.

Breakfast was average, not good.   The dirty patio experience was enough for us.
We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here twice on my jaunt up to Phoenix.  Once for dinner and once for brunch. Creative menu for dinner, enthusiastic wait person and vibrant space. Baked potato was cold. They brought a new one that was hot. It was very filling though wasn't what I expected. It was missing the buttery component and was more a pulled pork over potatoes dish. Satisfying though
Brunch was disappointing. Menu items lacked meat components. Waitress told me the black beans in the 56 Scramble were funky. So I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The dish was unappetizingly served. A kind of white vomit.  A sprig of something would help. Biscuit was dry and not incorporating well. I ordered bacon side which was not on menu she asked if I liked it crispy I said yes. I got a huge wad of stuck together bacon. It was greasy and low grade. I felt sick immediately. My teeth are still covered in grease
This place needs to work on their signature dishes and increase consistency and quality of product.  It's a nice environment with friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here on Sunday for lunch and loved the atmosphere and patio, however things went a bit downhill from here. Our server Shae (?) was great but the lunch was a bit off. The pretzel app was great and the lunch went down from there. The burgers were cooked well enough however there was more bun than burger and the bun was burnt. When Shae came to check on us I can't help but think she saw the burnt bread as we had set it aside. The drinks were good enough but the cinnamon in my wife's  drink was either absent or just not enough. We will be back and hopefully the buns won't be burnt and the burger will fit the bread"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with high hopes. My husband & I have been wanting to check this place out. We started out with the chips & dip. It was just okay, the dip to me tasted like french onion soup mix and the chips (while made in house) were somewhat bland. For lunch, I ordered the green mac & cheese and my husband had the chicken firebread. Our entrees took about 40 minutes even though they seemed to be quite slow. Not one to give up on a place when they may just be having a bad day I was hoping that I'd be impressed enough with our meals to return. That was not the case. 

My mac & cheese was good, but was cold when it got to the table. If I'm waiting 40 minutes for a meal it should be hot when it arrives. It was something I'd try again, but since we won't be going back I guess I'll have to find my mac & cheese elsewhere.

Besides also being cold, my husband's firebread HAD A HAIR IN IT! Definitely not okay. When we informed our waitress she didn't seem fazed, she simply offered to get him something else. When he told her he didn't want to wait another 40 minutes she rudely replied that she had coursed our meal out & didn't have them fire the entrées until we were done with our appetizer. Which would have been fine if true, but it took us maybe 10 minutes to eat our chips & dip. So I doubt our entrées took 30 minutes.

Overall we were severely disappointed & won't be back. Seems like a cool place to drink though..."}
{"text":"Loved this place before they started their remodel. Went back for the first time since reopening and was sadly disappointed. The service was atrocious. We called ahead and asked made a reservation and they gave us some push back at first, understandable because it was a Saturday night, but when we got arrived, there may have been only two other parties in the restaurant (other then the bar). We were greeted right away and they we waited about 5-7 minutes to be seated. Once again, the place was empty. Once seated we ordered and everything was relatively smooth. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and if it had a rating alone it would be a 1 star. Perhaps the worst I've had in the phx-Scottsdale-West coast area. 45min-1hr later we finally got our food. This is where the 3 star comes in. The pulled pork sandwich was great. Can't complain one bit about other than I wish I would have ordered two of them. After finishing our meals, we yet again waited an eternity to get the bill. Needless to say, we probably won't be running back to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my new favorite places in Phoenix...very cool, open space, awesome happy hour prices, amazing food, and great service at the bar!"}
{"text":"lovely local spot!  i wish we had something like this near our home.  good food great atmosphere, friendly place."}
{"text":"My co workers and I have a payday Friday tradition where we pick a new place to eat lunch that's considered cool/hip/trendy.  Today's vote was for kitchen 56.  

We walked in and the smell of a wood burning oven was a nice welcomeing scent.  It had a nice open floor plan and didn't make you feel cramped at all while eating in the dining room.

I ordered one of the firebread sandwiches which was like a flatbread type sandwich.  I got the Steak.  When it came out it came with a salad and I asked for fries to which they promptly brought out a large plate of fries which the whole table then got to enjoy.  the steak was a little tough to chew through and not quite the best cut to put on a sandwich but the flavor was great and the bread was super fresh and soft.

all in all had a nice experience and will be back for sure"}
{"text":"It was okay had been going there since they opened but things have kinda gone south on k 56 pricing way over priced and the staff lacked personality now I remember why we quit going"}
{"text":"First time at Kitchen 56.  We ordered the Chilaquiles and a Beet Salad from the Brunch Menu; and although the taste of our food was VERY good, the portion size of the Beet Salad left us a bit hungry.  

I am not a fan of portion sizes that are so big that half the food is either thrown away and wasted or is unhealthy for an average sized adult, but the $13.56 \"side salad\" sized Beet Salad almost seemed insulting.   They could have at least bulked it up with more greens, but this salad had almost no bulk whatsoever.  My husband was completely finished with his salad before I had even finished half of my $9.56 chilaquiles, which was not a huge portion either, but was plenty.  

I'll come back again and try something else, and might have to just speak up if I'm served a child sized meal again."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Kitchen 56 - I'm not in love. I went here a couple of weeks ago with friends for dinner. The service was fine, the atmosphere nice but the food was just...ok. I had one of the pizzas and a salad. My friends both seemed to enjoy their meals but no rave reviews. I had the same feeling that I had a Beckett's Table - lots of hype but it missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"I love this place-- the ambiance, the building, the drinks...and the green chili mac and cheese! What a lovely neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"First time here on my birthday.  Love that they let me use my free appetizer and free dessert on the same visit.  Great Happy Hour menu with too die for chicken wings.  A great spicy and zesty taste to them.  The Arcadia salad is light and filling (probably because I ate 7 chicken wings before).  But seriously very good flavor.  Side of green chile mac n cheese which you can get as a meal was good but could have used a bit more of a kick.  

Love the history of the building and like that it is not very noisy."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and food was good. Ordered dessert and wasn't told that the freezer was down so the ice cream wouldn't be included. Then, no break on price despite the dessert missing that element."}
{"text":"Ok, we eat here almost every week!

The food is great (I've had exactly one item I wouldn't order again)...the burgers are top notch, the pizzas very good, the salads exceptional...I could go on and on...

The staff is awesome, really friendly and attentive. The owner is a sweetheart.

It's just a great local place...and definitely try the calamari, it's outstanding!"}
{"text":"We drive by this place everyday and finally decided to drop-in for dinner. MISTAKE. In both entrees the meat tasted old (chicken) or rancid (pork). It was literally disgusting and inedible. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We are new to town and stopped in for happy hour.  The cocktails were great.  We had the wings, which were cooked perfectly, and a nicely presented bruschetta as well.  Several days later I returned for lunch with my daughter and we had a hamburger and Philly cheesesteak.  The homemade potato chips are sinful and was more than the two of us could eat.  We also stopped in for brunch and everything was spot on.  Nice local place to get consistently good food and gracious service."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since we drive by here on our way to our scottsdale office all the time. The ambiance is really nice.. its a very cute restaurant. The menu seemed interesting but we were both disappointed in our food. The soup and the meals both lacked any flavor. The salad dressing was the most flavorful thing on the plate. I had a nice chunk of some black plastic in my chicken salad wrap. I was done eating after discovering that. The server never came to check on us after taking our order until he came to pick up the plates. Upon letting him know about the plastic he just said oh, do you want something else? ... well i might have.... 20 minutes ago. then we waited another 10 minutes for our check and the manager to come over and explain that my entree had been removed from the check.  I would hope so. I don't think we'll be returning. Typically food can save poor service but neither were impressive."}
{"text":"There's a reason it's barely 3.5 stars.  Came in at 6 - though we struggled for parking and then walked in high degree weather, seats were available, \"there was a wait.\"  We've been here before and the food is not great, but can pass when you're hungry.  The \"homemade\" bread is greasy and incredibly too big.  It's a great place to have a \"poured\" drink, but nothing that you would expect a true bartender to know... Keep driving to downtown Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is a comfortable place to have a meal with drinks. I meet some friends here that are regulars so we did get excellent table service.

I had the Pork Chop served on top of mashed potatoes with red cabbage served on the side. The meal was about $15, a heck of a lot more than you would pay at a Lone Star Restaurant. I thought there was nothing really special about the Pork Chop, it just didn't have that succulent juicy taste that I have come to expect from a Pork Chop. The mashed potatoes and red cabbage were just ok for me.

I have heard that Kitchen 56 has great Happy Hour food specials. So I would probably return if in the area during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I finally made the short trip to Kitchen 56 for lunch yesterday. Seeing as the overall rating sits at a comfortable 3.5 stars, I was never in any sort of rush to get here.

As I usually like to do, I went ahead and found a good seat at the bar to grab a drink and some food. The menu reads very straight forward and the selection is somewhat limited for brunch and lunch options, which isn't always so bad. After some debate I settled on the Green Chili Angus Burger and a Black Cherry 'Adult' Lemonade.

The drink came out and it was fine -  nothing too special about it, but it was refreshing and did it's job as a nice easy to drink cocktail. The burger was pretty uninspired. Yeah it had poblanos and pepperjack on it, but there wasn't even the slightest kick to it and I had to put some of my side salad on it to give it a little more flavor of some kind. I ordered medium, it came out medium-well....and so the story goes, an overall 'so-so' experience.

The service at the bar was good and attentive, the decor is nice, but the food isn't going to blow your socks off at all. I didn't come rushing into this place to begin with, and probably won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I love Kitchen 56.  Love.

A friend suggested this place for happy hour one afternoon, and I'm so glad she did.  I'd heard of the place but knew nothing about it, so before we met, I looked at their website and made a mental list of the things I wanted to try.  None disappointed!

First of all, the place is adorable.  It wasn't at all what I expected, but I loved what it ended up being.  From the outside, the place looked simple and welcoming.  Inside, it's open and casual, and decorated really nicely, from a large mural to fun wall decor.  Seating was available at the bar, tables, or booths by the windows.

Upon learning it was my first visit, the server assigned to my table was welcoming and enthusiastic and was quick to recommend drinks and menu items.  My first drink was one of their signature adult lemonades - the black cherry.  It was ridiculously delicious from first sip to the last few amarena cherries left in the bottom of the glass.  I could have easily enjoyed a few of these drinks, especially since they didn't taste like they had alcohol in them!  I had the pink panther next, and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't nearly as good as the first.  Since I was two drinks in, I decided a bit of food would be a good idea, so I tried the black bean dip with tortilla chips off the happy hour menu (it seems to have rotated off the menu, sadly!).  It was SO GOOD and I was disappointed when we finished it.  For dinner, I went with the griddled corn cakes topped with pulled pork.  This was the best thing I'd eaten in a long time!  It was served with two sauces, both of which perfectly complemented the flavors of the corn and pork.  Definitely my favorite.

There's nothing I didn't like about this place, except maybe that it wasn't closer to my home.  I look forward to visiting again and again!"}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice.  Our first visit was on our anniversary when we were served a bottle of the Emeritus Pinot warm.  The bar tender tried to remedy the situation by putting the bottle in a chiller.   Not a place for wine lovers like ourselves.

We came back last night and had a terrible experience.  We ordered the Emeritus Pinot again.  Fortunately it was properly served :). We orders the steak frites for dinner (my favorite) and were served a steak salad.  We sent the salads back .  I kid you not, the kitchen scraped the steak off, added some frites and served It to us cold.  Pathetic.  We sent it back.   The manager came out and offered  us free dessert, never mind that we hadn't eaten anything for dinner....We were not at Denny's (although I wish we were), a brownie doesn't make it all better...we paid for the wine, left and went to Humble Pie.   I don't think we will give this place a third try."}
{"text":"Cute, friendly, yummy, Arcadia neighborhoody place to eat and drink. Thank you for a good selection of draft beer and things to eat. It's very clean and simple- and casual, yet classy! I've been here twice and I look forward to entertaining my peeps at this place."}
{"text":"Good service, good comfortable setting BUT
food was not so good.
I had the chips & dip - not bad
my entree was the green chili mac
the waitress said this had a little kick

The only kick was me kicking myself in the ass for ordering this bland tasteless product

Total cost before tip
$20.50"}
{"text":"My friends and I went for a girlie lunch and had a great time. The food was excellent...it's cinco de mayo so the special was fish tacos and they were awesome. My friends had other dishes and we all agreed that we were in love...it's fabulous supporting a local business and Kitchen 56 did not dissapoint!"}
{"text":"Only needed one visit to wash out the memories of mediocrity from the failed Vatra experiment.  The place has a casual ambiance that better fits the neighborhood.  Their tempura battered tofu and noodles is a dish that could make me a 4 day a week vegetarian.  Good spot that hopefully can continue to grow into its potential."}
{"text":"Good decor and relaxed atmosphere.  Service was excellent - very friendly, engaging and attentive.  

Had tomato basil soup to start which was quite good, and not served too hot.  Pulled pork sandwich was great, but the Kobe burger was better.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have finally decided how to handle the 1/2 star.  It's going to hinge on service.  And the service at Kitchen 56 was barely passable.  Our server was slow to get to us, took the order of a table that arrived later than us before she took ours.  She then ignored us once we got our food.  After it became clear we weren't going to see our check anytime soon, my husband gave the evil eye to the hostess, followed by a point to our server who was, in her defense, busy flirting with any and all male employees nearby. I hope that worked out for her.

If I ignore all that, I could really like Kitchen 56.  I like the simple menu of pizzas, pasta, and casual American food.  We started with the drunk bread (kind of like a deep dish pizza with bread soaked in white wine and butter).  It sounded better than it is.  However, my burger was great, and I could see Kitchen 56 being a great go-to spot for me."}
{"text":"3 stars because 2 of us thought it was really good and 2 of us thought it was just good. Went here last night with a 4-some around 9pm on a Saturday; they weren't very busy and we were seated promptly. The server was attentive and taking drink orders almost immediately. For dinner I had the Arcadia Pie cuz I love me some goat cheese and bacon. It was tasty but there wasn't a sauce on the pizza and I kinda wished it had a drizzle of an herbed olive oil or something cuz it was just a lil dry. The boyfriend loved the pork tenderloin saying it was spiced perfectly. Another at our table had the tofu dish which she described as the best tofu she's ever had (she apparently had been here earlier in the week and had the same dish then too.)  The pulled pork sandwich across the table from me looked pretty tasty too, but didn't get the raving review the others did. 
They have some really interesting sounding cocktails on their menu... Maple Manhattan anyone? Their wine list is extensive and fairly priced as well. They have a giant cinnamon roll on their wknd breakfast menu that I would love to tackle along with a latte sometime soon!"}
{"text":"8:52 pm and the kitchen is closed!!!! Hell man this is a local Resturant that is not open for business. Crazy"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to stop in for lunch with a few girlfriends as I have been wanting to try Kitchen 56 for a long time now. We got there about 12:15 and it wasn't too busy at all and we were seated right away. We ordered the Pretzel Dippers to start and they were very yummy! We then ordered our lunch. I had the Vegetable Firebread, my girlfriends had the Turkey Firebread and Turkey Cranberry Firebread and they all came with fries. When they came out we were shocked at how big the servings were! You can easily share a sandwich with someone as we all took the other 1/2 with us to go. I LOVED my Firebread sandwich. The vegetables were great and the spread wasn't too overpowering. Both my girlfriends really liked their sandwiches too. The services was great and I cannot wait to bring my boyfriend back for lunch or dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place. 
The live music was...fine...but SO LOUD. They took the black bean burger off the menu, which is a big bummer. The restaurant itself is really cool, and I liked the overall design layout, but service was mediocre and the salad I paid a million dollars for was small and not thrilling. 

I'd like to go back for drinks and apps and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Woah. Talk about small portions. $17 for the Roasted Chicken plate & it was literally the smallest dish ever. Not even a side included. Ate it in LITERALLY 3 minutes (more like swallowed). Not happy. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Let's start with all the positives at Kitchen 56. Extremely friendly staff at this restaurant. Love the service behind the bar very attentive towards customers. Great looking space with nice decor and atmosphere! Right off 56th St & Indian School this is a prime Arcadia location. This part I hate having to talk about. The negatives of Kitchen 56, starting with the very limited dinner menu. Not a lot of options on the menu. I decided to keep it easy and try two of the choices available. The burger and pulled pork sandwich. Picking two of the less expensive items as a way to gauge this place. See If I would trust them with one of their more advanced dishes. The trust is just not there folks. The burger which was order medium well came out over well done and dry. No flavor, just the presence of a slightly burnt bun with cheese. Would not be fair to even consider this as an entry in any best burger competition. On to the pulled pork, this came out cold to taste. Literally the meat was cold on the bun which tells me it has been refrigerated. Even though I overheard one of the servers telling another guest they are a fresh kitchen. Nothing is prepared in advance all fresh. Bottom line is you'd be better off going to In & Out Burger or Dicky's BBQ. To be fair the French fries were delicious on both orders. I do appreciate how nice everyone was here though!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: This converted gas station to diner has a unique vibe. Perhaps a modern yet retro/relaxed character would best describe it. The large dog friendly patio opens to a super huge service window that services the bar. The place is bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside. Patrons mostly 30 something's and up. Lots white collars on weekdays and a good mix on weekends. 

Food: Great selection of salads and sandwiches, all well prepared with quality touches but wouldn't go so far as to call it a artisan sandwiches. I had the Caesar salad and Turkey cranberry sandwich both were great! Appreciated the focaccia bread and havarti cheese. Generous portions. Impressive beer/cocktail list as well.

Price: At 13 dollars a sandwich I thought it was a bit steep but perhaps it's par for course for the area, not sure as I don't frequent this part of town.

Service: I ate at the bar, was well attended to. Food served promptly.

Overall: I can see this place as a great spot for a business lunch and cocktail during the week or bring the dog and some friends for a weekend lunch and beer."}
{"text":"While exploring the Arcadia, I stumbled acrossed this place. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the smell from the wood fire grill.  The establishment is very clean and the staff was very prompt and friendly.  The happy hour prices are spectacular, with the portion size.  Happy hour tacos for 6 dollars, came with a surprising 4 tacos.  That's right not 2 or 3; but 4.    Definitely worth the stop and coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I had the macaroni and cheese which was very good, but the server and hostess were so rude and slow that I'll never go back again.  We knew what we wanted right away and I asked if we could put in our meal order after he took our drink order (3 waters, please), and he straight up said, \"No, I'll take your order after I bring your drinks.\"  SO rude.  Our server never came to check on us after we got our food.  We had been done with our meal for about five minutes and our server walked right by me, I looked at him and waved to him as he walked by to get the check and he completely ignored me.  I'll never ever go back."}
{"text":"Had a recent birthday party here.  They were kind enough to let me bring my own cake and take over a large portion of their restaurant on a Saturday.  (We had about 50-60 folks drop in over the course of 4:00 p.m. to about 8:00).  During HH, the drinks are $5.00 and many appetizers are very reasonably priced.  The food was devoured quickly and without complaint.  Brittni the manager was very gracious about letting us have so many people there.
One thing I will say is that parking is tricky.  Their lot is not big and they have another gated area across the street that filled up rather quickly.  I should have told people to car pool!  They opened up the patio area which made the restaurant quite warm.  Other than that, the guests really enjoyed themselves.  It is family friendly, (they have high chairs and whatnot), with a good menu that has enough variety to keep lots of people happy.  Great sangria and they even have a \"Pickle Back\".  Check it out on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Visited kitchen 56 yesterday for an early dinner, food was Wonderful. I ate with friends that are Vegan and they were able to eat plenty from the menu. The edamame appetizer was so flavorful, will get that again! Our waiter was great, helpful with getting vegan items correct. Will be back for brunch next time!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Elvis Presley - Heartbreak Hotel)

Well since I got really hungry
I found a new place to dwell.
Its off Indian School and 56th Street
At Kitchen 56

You make me so hungry baby
I get so hungry
I get so hungry I could die

And although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
Where very hungry foodies
Do write away their review

You make me so hungry baby
I get so hungry
I get so hungry I could die

Kitchen 56 is located at the border of Arcadia and S. Scottsdale.  It has a vintage full service gas station ambient with a modern twist.  Who knew this would work so well!  I attended on a Sunday evening for the all day HH on drinks and live music was a rocking!

It was a lazy Sunday so I ordered me a PBR, yep....yep....yep.  For only $2 a can man that's some cheap fass beer!  Though not much taste I can still appreciate me some PBR and how long it has survived the test of time.  For my entree I ordered their Black Angus burger with fries.  Needless to say, and to my surprise.  It was one damn good fass burger!  Cooked medium and oozing American cheese all over with the fresh crunch of the onions and pickles gave this delectable burger between some butter bread and awesome POW to my palates!  Yummy!  I don't recall talking much that night.  

Service was awesome our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu plus his recommendations were definitely appreciated.  Can't wait to go back and another round and neither should you! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a local/neighborhood restaurant that has struggled since it opened.  The food is so-so; the hours somewhat sporadic, in that the restaurant and bar closes whenever business seems slow later in the evening; but service is by far its main downfall.  The last time I took my family there, it was over10 minutes after being seated before anyone made contact with us; it took us nearly 45 minutes after placing a food order to get the food (the place was not really busy); and no one bothered to check to see if things were alright at any point.

Tonight, I thought I'd give it another shot.  Again, I took the family, hoping to support a neighborhood business.  There were 3 servers working, and only 4 tables taken by customers.  Remarkably, it again took nearly 10 minutes for a server to make contact or ask for drink orders, then a long time to get the drinks.  Again, no one bothered to check on us after the food was served, even for new drink orders, which we would have made.  Instead of enjoying a meal out, we wound up aggravated, with over-tired and hungry kids.

One might think this is just bad luck, but on both occasions, the owner/manager was in the immediate vicinity, seemingly oblivious to what was going on around her.

Also, beware, although the childrens' menu says \"drinks included\" in the entree price of $6.00, this place charged us for the kids' milk.

Save your money and go down Indian School in either direction  There are several places that know what they are doing (not meaning OHSO)."}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is a great place to stop in during lunch or happy hour. We've had virtually every thing on the menu and the food is always great. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area and will periodically host live music. The restaurant also has a wonderful history. Their downsides are that they redid the menu last year and a lot of our favorites are no longer there, service has been lacking a little lately and they raised their prices (they would've had more stars if it weren't for these things). I guess restaurants think this is something they should automatically do when they are in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer and had a bike because a lot of their customers who were there on a Sunday afternoon came on their bikes and if I had a bike I would ride mine here.
The open, airy layout and the windows create a very cheerful atmosphere. Inside is FRC concept decor:modern and casual.
I started with a petite salad which I am mixed on. The dressing was a brandy vinaigrette which I was not crazy about. I don't like sweet dressings so that's what killed it. However the greens themselves were SO fresh I would have sworn they were picked from a garden, washed and served to me. It's greens like that that make me want to be an active salad eater instead of having one because my Mom always made me have one.
My salad was followed by an Angus Burger which, good God, was AMAZING! The TWO patties prepared a perfect medium rare with, again, a red onion and lettuce that I swear were picked from a garden and put on my burger. The menu said that it was served with American cheese, which I HATE but this had to be the best damned American cheese I've ever had.
It was a struggle to finish but I stayed the course.......and I succeeded. This was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. They have a bar that opens to a patio with some seating, and get this, a ping pong table. They'd better keep me the hell away from that after I've had a few otherwise guests are going to get hit.
Definitely going on my faves list for Phoenix. Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been wondering about this place for a while and always heard it's just OK but decided to give it a try. Well- it's just OK. Nothing particularly bad, but not that great either.  It seems like a great place for appetizers and drinks on a nice day, but my salad was average and pricey."}
{"text":"Today I wanted to go back to Kitchen 56 for dinner with my best friend Katy Andrew. We were hoping that the young lady who waited on us the last time would be there. And there she was Sara who by the way had a Large White watch (inside joke). She was as business and friendly as the first time. 
 
The hostess sat us at a table for 4 people and this family came in and they looked like they really wanted to have dinner at the Kitchen 56 and I felt they Katy and I did not need a table for 4 so as they were leaving I stood up and flagged them to stay and gave up our table and we moved to a table for 2. This family was much appreciated, I said to them if I do something nice for someone else someone will do something nice for someone else. I felt I did what was right. The hostess was so happy that she gave Katy and I 2 free desserts.

Now for what we had for dinner I had the pork ribs with fries, corn cake and house slaw it was off the charts. Katy had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and she said it was awesome.

The desserts we had were a brownie with berry sauce and vanilla ice cream and the second one was a baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. The whole meal was awesome.

We wanted to make the family feel special so we had Sara give them the Fudge Brownie dessert after we left. I would have loved to see their faces when it arrived.

Keep up the good work Kitchen 56 your the best."}
{"text":"Awesome food, drinks and service! Came here after a great time at comedy store! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"A couple of things stuck out to me for this place. One was the really clean and refreshing ambience they've got going on. The other thing that stuck out was the lightness, yet tastyness of the food. I had a turkey and egg sandwich, which was pretty darn good.

The staff seemed nice, too and the prices really weren't bad. I met somebody here on my lunch break and surprisingly made it back to the office in time. Sometimes it's hard to get in and out at a sit down place in an hour, but they pulled it off. However, I feel like there would be no pressure if you wanted to stay and chat for a bit."}
{"text":"*sigh* I really wanted to like this place. It's adorable (although a smidge overpriced).

But my (what was supposed to be fried) egg in my chilaquile was runny and gross, the carnitas had a funky flavor to them and no one bothered to ask me if that was ok or how I like my eggs. 

Since my hubby LOVES slimy eggs (*hork*), I gave the whole thing to him and just ate some bacon and potatoes, although even he thought the egg was a bit underdone. 

The saving grace for me was the black cherry lemonade (made with alcohol and muddled black cherries)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to meet friends! They have a great Happy Hour menu and the service is always great.

My personal faves are the homemade potato chips with dip (always a hit!) and the Calamari Salad. The Calamari was always my \"go-to\" dish, but the last 2 times I've ordered it I've been disappointed.  I've been told about kitchen staff changes and recipe changes, but I feel like they took a great recipe and ruined it.

I still love the location, staff and ambiance, so I'll just find new dishes to order. I've had their mushroom pizza and a few of their other dishes. All good. Hopefully no more recipe changes in the future."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been this excited about a new place.  I have passed by countless times, but finally decided to check this place out and I took my mom for brunch for Mother's Day.  I went back for dinner this past weekend I liked it so much.  Both times the service was great and the food was delicious!

When I went for brunch I ordered the chilaquiles and Kitchen 56 is easily at the top of the list for great chilaquiles.  The perfect amount of spice (enough to taste it and give a good kick  without being over the top) in the sauce and the flour tortillas weren't greasy at all.  So often when the tortillas are fried in-house they come out greasy and more stale than crisp, but they were crunchy.  I tried the backporch 'adult' lemonade.  It was very refreshing and not overly sweet which I loved.

For my second visit I ordered the Short Ribs from the dinner menu and they were amazing! The meat was fork tender and tasty!  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and had a great black pepper kick to them.  They were are little thicker and starchier than I would usually prefer (but that just proved that they were fresh made in house and not rehydrated out of a box which is the way I like it!!).  I also split the beet salad and it was amazing!  The balsamic dressing has a great bite to it without being too acidic from the vinegar and it goes so well with the crispy pancetta and goat cheese.  With the right protein the salad could easily be an entree meal!  I may have overindulged a bit when it comes to cocktails, but I tried the Moscow Mule and the '56' Cooler.  The Mule was spot on for what you'd expect.  I was intrigued by the '56' Cooler because it was basically a margarita with St Germain.....something about St Germain just draws me in.  Great balance of flavors between the grapefruit juice and the St Germain!

I can't wait to go again and try something else new on the menu.  I can't imagine that I'd be disappointed with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"After months of being shut down for remodeling this neighborhood gem reopened.  The staff is very friendly and excellent service.  We love hitting up happy hours spots let me say the chicken tacos and the short rib tacos are super tasty and quite filling. We also ordered the cauliflower risotto that was the bomb!  They have nice patio love the new redesign on the inside. The only downside is the parking lot is a little small. Great neighborhood hangout with nice ambiance and excellent food!"}
{"text":"While I was here.. there were sanitation issues with the cooks in the kitchen. One we saw touching his hair with gloves on then continued to work with food. Waiter got the order wrong, Dropped a towel used for cleaning tables on the floor then continues to use it. The Food was nothing special. I would have tried this place again for a second chance but for the sanitation practices of the staff. They need a stronger kitchen manager and a FOH manager! Very Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Quick trip to Phoenix and came here on our daughter's recommendation, loved the place!  Very nice atmosphere, not too upscale and not too casual.  Seemed to be a lot of business-types in there coming to grab a bite or drink after work.  The food was delicious and the portions were huge.  Definitely grab the green chili mac-n-cheese if you come!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing lunch! Added chicken to the Arcadia Salad. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I can't say I've had a bad experience here yet. Green chile Mac= delish. Pizza= stellar (no, not a quote on quote pizza place but still serves up a really good pie). The burgers have always been very tasty as well. The one thing I would criticize is the portions on some of the food. The mac n cheese is not exactly a hefty portion, and the salads are a bit on the small side. Other than that, A+. 
It's a mostly quiet restaurant with a nice, dog friendly patio and an enjoyable bar to sit at. We probably go here once a month and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch. Nice enough place inside. About 20-25% full. Uh-oh. Good looking craft brews on tap. Menu looked solid. Interesting sandwiches and salads. I ordered the barbecued pulled pork sandwich with onion strings. Onion strings on the sandwich were cold-ish, weird. The pork itself was very bland, and the barbecue sauce was nothing to write home about (I can't explain the reviewer love I see on the postings next to mine). My colleagues seemed to like their meals o.k., but no one was talking about their meals or sharing what they got, so that speaks volumes.

This place might be worth a shot with a better chef/cook or better recipes. Looks good on paper, but I can't recommend it. Too many good options nearby to make this a go-to place."}
{"text":"Today was a beautiful day to have brunch with a girlfriend in this airy place.  I loved seeing people with their dogs.  The 56 scramble was good for me and the French toast my friend had looked amazing. I also enjoyed my green tea lemonade cocktail.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Go for Stephen. At the bar. You want to talk? He's interesting. Want to stay buried in your phone? Cool. Want food recommendations and the plate delivered fast? Stephen. 

Yes. The kitchen is solid. They know what they are doing back there. But Stephen at the bar. He gets the five star. 

Note it."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while looking for a friend's house in the area, so we dropped in for a drink.  From the outside it doesn't look like much and generally once inside it also is less than impressive.  As we only had time for a drink we asked for a menu to check out what they had to offer.  The menu was a very pleasant surprise with dishes one would never expect to find based on the area, outside look of the place and the inside atmosphere.  We decided to come back later, that was a couple of months ago and we've been back many times since and have introduced our friends to the excellent food at this establishment.  The staff is well versed on the menu, is helpful but not pushy.  The wine list is very good and the food is outstanding.  Don't judge this book by the cover.  We go back often, finding that each new dish is a good at the last if not better!"}
{"text":"Great spot near old town! We started off with the adult lemonades, really delicious, I had the blueberry one and my friend got the strawberry one. Themn we got the drunk bread and edamame apps, omg both so good but the drunk bread was delicious!!! 

I got the ahi sandwich and it was delicious. My friend got the burger, she enjoyed it, my family got the trout special, ribs, and a pasta dish. All were well enjoyed.

We were too full for dessert, but another time for sure!"}
{"text":"I hate to write such a blah review, but I was really disappointed with the drunk bread. It really was nothing special and without being drunk, totally avoidable. While the Patio is really quite nice, I don't see any other reason to go."}
{"text":"AWESOME dose not even come close.  I have enjoyed my dining experience there.  I love the atmosphere and the wait staff.  GREAT FOOD and the best Arnold Palmer I have ever had!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch at Kitchen 56 a couple weeks ago, well I'm a BIG FAN!  I ordered the BurgerDeluxe , yes I'm a huge burger snob, at any rate, I always judge a place by how they make or will make their burgers.  I ordered it Very Extra Rare...and Yes that IS exactly how it was served.  Our server said, and I quote, \"I told the chef that you indeed wanted it to only be introduced to the grill, not actually to date the grill\".  How Perfect Was That???  It was just perfect and I was giddy the entire meal.  The service was not over agressive, just attentive. The balance of the meal consisted of my dining partner had the pulled pork.  She liked it a lot and would go back!  The onion marmalade on my burger was extremely note worthy.  Just the right balance of sweet without losing the onion flavor!  

So I say, Go Forth and Enjoy Kitchen 56.!.!.!..."}
{"text":"Love their green chilli mac. I have been here twice now and have not been disappointed. The first I had a sandwich and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This place is great!! A must try! give this place a shot its totally worth it. we all love Indy places!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fantastic food. Great combination."}
{"text":"WAS really good, but I guess they changed their menu and chef. We talked about the wings here for a very long time but we're completely disappointed with the resent change. Wings were burnt and tasted different. No more amazing kale wraps. Ordered a beet salad that had no pecans like it said on the menu. Will not be returning. There goes another good spot."}
{"text":"A people-friendly, dog-friendly, local joint that is truly a neighborhood gem. Steve and the other bartenders will treat you and your furry friend(s) like family."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food.

Whether its the pulled pork sandwich (for which they have no problem giving extra sides of bbq sauce), the steak salad or tender short ribs, I have a seriously hard time not reordering the same things over and over.  Every visit here I've tried something different and have yet to be disappointed.  

BTW, the housemade chips are light and crispy and go great with a dark and stormy or moscow mule.  

Aside from the food, the service has always been accommodating.  On one visit, we had barely 30 minutes to eat and drink in order to make a flight.  Everything was rushed to our table asap (despite the restaurant being full) and as they were ready.  We were in and out with time to spare.  

I can't wait for my next visit and to try something new."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food and the drinks are amazing. Stacey did a great job making our bloody Mary's. She deserves a promotion from serving. Great personality and outstanding service. Thanks again Stacey, see you next time!!!"}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 has great food, and clean atmosphere, great patio, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"1st timers and we hope to come back soon!  Nice ambiance inside or out, nice selection of Happy Hour appetizers (meals).  The calamari salad & wood fired pizza were very good.  My wife loved the Green Tea Lemonade, and our server was very knowledgeable & attentive."}
{"text":"stopped by for a Happy Hour beer and to watch some basketball, and the people at the bar and behind the bar were so much fun that I stayed for dinner - had baby back ribs and WOW - excellent flavor and fall off the bone tender; great quality ribs.
great neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"Lovely find, I had to use bathroom so pulled in here. Order food and it was delicious!!  Goat cheese on my burger. And the drink was wonderful.   We will be stopping by here again. Plus the bartender looked like a young Blondie (The singer). I just liked this place. Quiet and great service!!"}
{"text":"Maybe lunch isn't the best time to try Kitchen 56. I thought it was just okay.

The boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and we were literally the only customers there. But everyone was very friendly and we got our food very fast since it's not like the kitchen was busy!

I ordered a salad and boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese. First thing we noticed was that all the dishes were chipped. Each bowl had at least 3 chips on it. Do they have a clumsy dishwasher? Is that the look they are going for? Not sure but it was a little off-putting to eat off of broken dishes.

The salad was pretty good. Not great. Decent enough size but the dressing was kinda blah. Boyfriend felt the same way about his mac and cheese. It was good but not great.

I wish the food had been better because I liked the atmosphere and like I said the staff was very nice. I just don't feel compelled to go back again. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Live around corner... Decided to try... Loved the ambiance. Sat outside on patio. Super cute. Food was so so. The flatbread with Rosemary is w rip off. 8 dollars for pita and oil and balsamic. Pizza was just ok. La grande is a lotttttt better. The worst part: the service. We came on a Wednesday night after happy hour. Our waitress we just horrendous. Forgot about our table every time we asked for something. I finally got up to ask her for something and she was eating something in the back. Awful awul. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"My 87 year old grandmother took me here for lunch at noon on Friday. The restaurant was initially quite busy. We ordered the edamame starter. It was a large portion, heavily seasoned. My entree was the stir fry, while my grandmother ordered a large salad. The food came out quickly. My stir fry was alright but nothing I couldn't have had both better and cheaper at decent Chinese take out. My grandmother's salad was large but perhaps overpriced for a salad with no protein in it. 

The reason for two stars is because my grandmother asked our server for help deciding a dessert that had been recently recommended in a newspaper review. The server was not helpful in recalling the item referenced in the prior-day's review. Giving up, we ordered two Creme brûlées.  At this point, the restaurant  was very quiet. It was about ten minutes after ordering that I glanced over to the kitchen pass-through and saw a single Creme brûlée sitting there on the counter. Another ten minutes passed before a different server noticed it and brought it to our table. I do not know if the bill had one or two desserts charged, but two were ordered and we only got one. It took so long for one to arrive that we didn't have time to wait for a second. 

This incident, coupled with inattentive drink refills, makes me wonder if the young professionals in the restaurant getting their wine on during lunch break received  the same treatment as did my senior grandmother and my young female self."}
{"text":"Poor service & mediocre service.
We went because they had Ahi on the menu (trying to keep on WW plan). We ordered our entrees, and the black bean dip (yes, ignoring the fact there is probably gobs of cheese in it).  We asked if we can have some cut up veggies with it aside .. The waiter had to go ask, then telling us it would be additional $3 (seriously??).  After we receive the dip and gold plated zucinni slices, the waiter came back to tell us they are out of Ahi.  So is asked if I can replace the fries with the brussel sprout side on the steak frites dinner ... \"No, but you can sub the fries with more salad\".  So we had to order the sprouts on the side.  The Steak came out cooked nicely, but it would had been nice if they'd seasoned the steak ... even the chimichuri was bland.  Very very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great open atmosphere! Somewhat of a hipster vibe. My husband said the pulled pork sandwich was the best he ever had. I had the 56 Loco. Short ribs with egg and risotto, which was a little salty, but good. The dog friendly patio is also cute with a water feature. Love the smoky smell of the wood burning."}
{"text":"Worth trying once. The service was good. The food is good, but nothing over the top. My pork chop was a little dry but the calamari and mashed potatoes were tasty. Loved the brownie for dessert."}
{"text":"I think 3.5 stars had green chili burger no bun, salad instead of fries - great taste! Pablano peppers had touch oh cold probably cooked in advance than added to burger. Manager spent time everywhere but visiting with the guest."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch this weekend.  Our server was very nice (can't remember his name) and food was fresh and fast.  Salad and turkey sandwich were both pretty big, more than enough to share.  Very nice place.  Will go back soon"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out! I drive by all the time and thought it looked like a fun little place. The ambience is great and the food choices looked delicious. We had the corn cakes for an appetizer which is basically corn pancakes with pulled pork. Ok, but not great. I ordered the black bean burger for dinner and it was so bad I had to send it back. It looked like something pulled from the freezer and heated up, then topped with a refrigerator cold onion marmalade. Terrible. They happy replaced my meal with a margarita pizza which was ok at best. Overall the 2 stars are for the ambience. The service was fine, but the food was bad. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"You Arcadia folks are going to love Kitchen 56. Remodeled inside an old Car / Mechanical repair shop this place has tons of character. They kept pictures of the old mechanic shop up around for nostalgia and makes a good conversation starter if you bring a friend who has never been before. 

Their cocktails and bartenders have their stuff together for sure. Let them recommend one of the summa cocktails to refresh with natural fresh ingredients. Delish ISH!

The negative: Its a bit pricey, you won't be frequenting this place, even if you live in Arcadia due to the price."}
{"text":"Didn't hate it, didn't love it.  And they served me a desert they knew was bad.  If you know its bad don't serve it, very simple.  Upside is they have cucumber vodka."}
{"text":"We love us some K56, so many great things to try on the menu! Every trip is an adventure! Kitchen 56 takes pride in it's food and it shows, not to mention the varied menu, there truly is something for everyone here (even our pickiest friends can find something they like).

We tried the Wood-Fired Pizza - they have six different wood fired pizzas to choose from so it was a very difficult choice. I had tried the Spicy Salami & Sausage with San Marzano Sauce, fresh Mozzarella, herbs and spiced oil previously which was great, amazing crust, super delish toppings but we decided to try a different pizza this time. The Arcadia Pie features goat cheese instead of a more traditional mozzarella, leeks (for you foodie types), scallions, garlic and bacon. Winner. Winner... yep, very tasty. Of course bacon on anything is a sure hit but it was a nice compliment to the goat cheese and leeks, I would definitely recommend trying this for a nice change from your traditional pizza.

Who can resist Onion Strings... not us! They call them Onion Straws here but by either name they are a treat! The batter was not to thick, nice and light and the dipping sauce is was a spicy remoulade, which was a perfect compliment and a big hit at the table. Food you can eat with your fingers is always welcome at our table, call us low maintenance!

{"text":"We have eaten at Kitchen 56 twice, yesterday being the most recent. The restaurant was busy and the live music was playing on the outside seating area. We sat in the bar at a high top table and took in the music and enjoyed the lively bar scene. As usual the food was super. We shared an artisan cheese plate with a bottle of Chardonnay. Both we very good. Then we shared a calzone and steak salad. The portions and prices are reasonable and the food was tasty. Our server was also the bartender and although he was super busy at the bar he was also very attentive to our needs. Extra parking is available across the street and we used it on this busy night. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Since reopen the service and menu are awful! It is no longer a cute neighborhood restaurant! Miss  he old kitchen 56!"}
{"text":"We ate here with my cousin and his family, he lives close so he suggested this place. I looked at the menu and saw green chili burger so it was a yes. 
We showed up just before 6 so we ordered a few things on the happy hour menu and my cousin and I got the green chili burger. It was very unimpressive and very plain, first I think it needed more green chili peppers, that might have helped. 
we ordered pretzel dippers, wings and edemame..  The pretzel dippers are very good and would order again, the wings are just ok and the edemame was my least favorite of all time. sitting in some crazy salty teriyaki or soy sauce."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it took them forever to split our checks! As for the food, it was OK. I would recommend starting with the Chip & Dip....be careful it is addictive! Some of my co-workers tried the Firebread and none of them could finish their meal because their house made Ciabatta bread was so dense & heavy, not the typical texture for Ciabatta. Their side slaw was good. I also tasted their mac & cheese which was decent but rather heavy too. Menu was rather limited in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ordered the green chili angus beef burger here. It was okay. There's not much in the burger that costs $10. It was only the green chili, patty, and cheese. I did not like the buns. It was dry. The rest of the items on the menu seemed too pricey for me, which is why I ended up ordering a burger."}

{"text":"Truly deserves 5 stars, and here is why!  Drove from Tucson to Phoenix on a Friday night to pick up someone from the airport.  Had our dog with us!  Called ahead to O.H.S.O.  Was told they had a 20 minute wait for the patio.  Arrived, no parking, you MUST valet.  So we did.  Went inside, and it was nuts!  Very popular place!  Was then told an hour and half wait.  \"what happened to a 20 minute wait?\"  The hostess laughed and said, \"who told you that?\"  I told her the guy's name who answered the phone.  She apologized.  So we picked up our valeted car.  Went on Yelp, saw Kitchen 56 just down the road, also dog friendly.  Called ahead, said they would hold a table for us.  Arrived, plenty of parking, and a much nicer place from the outside!  Went inside, we were greeted and sat quickly on a beautiful, and clean patio.  The server could not have been nicer, and was eager to help us out with our time constraint to get to the airport.  She immediately brought out a cold water bowl for our pooch!  We hadn't even asked!  Our food was delicious and arrived quickly! And she was very prompt with our check as well, knowing we had to eat and run!  We will be back on our next trip up!  It's a lovely place, clean, and very nice atmosphere!

Did I  mention \"Dog Friendly!\""}
{"text":"I drive past this place all the time en route to go elsewhere.  One afternoon a friend and I decided to try a new place for a Sunday Funday.

Hey there all day happy hour!!! One of the few places that have an all day HH on Sundays!  Fantastic.

The staff was outgoing and friendly and with great specials on food and drink you can't beat it.  I am dinging a star because while the bartender did point out the happy hour drink specials, we had no idea that there were FOOD specials.  This was never mentioned nor was the HH food menu given to us. We found this out AFTER we ordered and ate.  Annoying.

The food was delicious as were the drinks. 

The live music is a nice relaxing touch and the patio is spacious with a small fountain, although misters would be nice outside."}
{"text":"We try to come here at least once a week for their happy hour specials, we can't get enough of the fish tacos and spicy cilantro wings! The service has always been excellent, our servers have been attentive and knowledgeable each time. The restaurant is beautiful, last week we were lucky enough to sit on the patio, it was a perfectly lovely evening!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome. Love the simplistic menu that offers great choices.
Great craft beers - the Modus Hoperandi is a lovely IPA and Osborn Hefe are just full of flavour.
Always love coming back here - the wine bar is lovely and offers a nice selection and the bar is low key, fully stocked and is a great place to meet for a casual drink.."}
{"text":"A cool place to eat and drink located in a \"historic\" spot.  Kitchen 56 was converted from an abandoned classic gas station into a modern little restaurant.  If you take the time to notice your surroundings, you can kind of tell the location's history by the convenient store layout of the restaurant and the parking lot.  Or just take a hint from giant picture of the old gas station on the wall.

The menu is interesting but very hit and miss.  We tried the drunk bread because it just sounded like something that we had to try.  Bread soaked in wine and baked with a gooey cheese.  It looked great when it arrived at the table, but when we had a bite, it tasted like you're the one getting drunk.  I didn't taste the wine flavor, I felt it.  A unique idea, but unfortunate fail.

I had the smoked salmon pizza.  It's like a bagel and cream cheese with arugula spread across the top.  It was pretty good, nothing I'd go out of my way to have again.  The arugula was just kind of toss on the top, so it fell all over the place.  My girlfriend had the short ribs, which were awesome.  The celery root puree it was place over was incredible.  The other couple we dined with had the pork tenderloin and the filet.  The filet came with sautéed onions (an oddly big portion placed off to the side) and green chile macaroni.

The macaroni is were we noticed some trouble with the service.  It the side dish was cool when the plate arrived.  No big deal, my friend who ordered it simply told the server.  He took the whole plate to have it fixed.  That's pretty lame for just a side dish.  She had to sit and wait while they heated everything back up.  It only took a few minutes, but felt a little unnecessary.  A manager did come out to apologize and check if everything was okay.  We also didn't come close to finishing the drunk bread, but no one ever said anything or asked us how it was.  The runner that brought us our food simply asked if we were done and cleared it.  Usually, if an appetizer for the table is not finished, that should be a sign that it was not enjoyed.  Perhaps a good time to ask the customers if there's something they can do to make it better the next time.

None of it was a terrible experience.  This is one of those unfortunate times when I wish Yelp gave half stars.  While I feel Kitchen 56 is better than A-Ok, it certainly is not at a point were I'd say I am definitely a fan.  If I lived closer to the arcadia area, I'd probably be more open to going back to give it another try.  There's plenty on the menu that I would like to try.  But there's too many places closer to me in north Scottsdale that I would prefer to try first.

One other random note.  When we first arrived, there was a young girl playing some acoustic guitar.  It was a little awkward that she was just sitting at table near the entrance (there's no stage or anything like that), but she was pretty good and it was quite enjoyable.  There's always something nice about subtle light live music.  She was only there until about 7:00.  I highly recommend they find a way to feature someone like her, and have that musician stay later."}
{"text":"The staff has become family to us since we've started coming here over a year ago. It seems that everyone who is a regular here becomes great friends with the staff and the other regulars.

 A fancy ambience, but somewhere you can come in casual attire and not feel uncomfortable. 

 and they have the best menu options ever! 

Great selection of burgers, pizza, pasta and various appetizers. 

And get the cinnamon doughnuts with chocolate dip for dessert!"}
{"text":"We were so excited when this restaurant was re-opening - but unfortunately last Monday night we made the mistake of having happy hour there and getting takeout food. It was unbelievably understaffed -the positivesthat the wine is cold and their wings are good. The food that we got to go was an \"Arcadia salad\" that was drenched in vinaigrette to the point where it was inedible and a cauliflower soup that was so salty that it couldn't be consumed. The loaded baked potato entrée with pork was edible but also tepid. If you're looking for hot food or enough staff to actually serve you - probably need to head down Indian school to another restaurant. Are the owners actually reading any of these reviews? It seems like the bartenders are doing a great job of mixing the 25 specialty drinks they have on the menu and the wings are great but all of the food is either coming out slow, cold, and/or poorly made... Hopefully the owners can respond to us in the community and let us know what they are doing to change their poorly staffed restaurant and their serious kitchen issues?"}
{"text":"Love the simple menu. Why have choices if what you have is your BEST to offer?! Great lunch/dinner & bar experience."}
{"text":"New kitchen staff ... Food is fantastic.  Kobe burgers are hot and juicy. Drinks are the best.  Visit when Leah is behind the bar ... She is the \"worst\" of the best --/just kidding she's the best!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 and all of us had never been here. The service was great, the appetizers delicious and drinks were superb. We all ordered different entrees and not one complaint from anyone! Everyone in my party thought the food was scrumptious!  Great job K56! We will return!!"}
{"text":"Yummy...yummy...yummy... was with work buddies we all enjoyed the food, drinks and service.
Our waitress was awsome considering 8 of us needed separate checks...

We have you book marked and will be back."}
{"text":"We were headed to another spot and decided on a whim to give Kitchen 56 a try. The outside patio was fun and happy-looking and it, the homey woodsmoke smell, and the 'local' neon sign, drew us in. 
The menu is full of delectable taste combos and we quickly decided in the prosciutto and fig pizza and brussel sprout hash. The server, Che, was very friendly and attentive and the food came quickly.  
The pizza was very tasty,  although was more in a dessert line to my taste since its sauce is honey-based, which the menu does clearly state. Thr crust was light and airy with just the right crispness. The sprouts were also done nicely, with just a touch of crunch.  The two of us split the pizza and hash and we still had leftovers.  
The other diners were a mix of young families and couples in their 40s. The price point was very reasonable, especially by Scottsdale standards. I would definitely come again if I was in the area and might even make a special trip."}
{"text":"Our friend goes here nearly every Friday so we decided to bike down and try it. The drinks and wings are where its at! Tender, juicy and great flavor - just spicy enough. We had burgers and they were pretty good too. The drinks however are simple yet creative and the happy hour is decently priced. I would definitely make this one of the regulars of the stomping ground for the wings and drinks alone."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you like good beer and good wine. The staff is always friendly, especially at the bar. You can't go wrong on the menu. Personal favorites are the drunk bread, Arcadia pie, and the Arcadia salad. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Since being redone, Kitchen 56 has got it perfect.  It's a great casual dining experience, not uptight at all.  The indoor,outdoor bar is great for nighttime summer dining.  I love wall mural of the old gas station that used to occupy the space.  

When I think of service at a casual place, I really focus on speed.  As I sat down at the bar, my drink was on the way and the menu was there.  After ordering, my food was out in less than 10 minutes.  That's about as good as you can get for casual dining.  Especially with the quality of food. 

The food was amazing.  I've been here 3 times and each time I tried something new.  Last time I had the burger and it was tasty.  I like the seasoning on the fries as well.  The first time I had the handmade parpardelle with slow roasted pork sauce (comfort food galore).  

They've made the parking easy and I think it's perfect for a quick stop on the way home from work.  

I can't wait till it cools off to sit in the lounge seats outside and play some ping-pong!"}
{"text":"This place is underrated on here, I think. It was more casual an atmosphere than we expected, what with the laminated menus and bright light, but the food was excellent. Had the tuna with coocnut rice and grilled bok choy. Can't recommend it enough. They need to expand the wine list some. I know it's casual but if you're serving high-quality food, you need better wine choices to go with it."}
{"text":"Had the super burger and fries tonight... excellent! 

I like that while they do have some tv's on with sports on them... the house
music takes front stage.  Might be different on big playoff nights.

Also... the tequila thyme drink... delicious and actually had some 
alchyhol in it!  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Every experience here has been great.  This place is always accommodating and will make me the turkey burger off the dinner menu for lunch and never seem annoyed.  I'm a server and understand how annoying people like me can be and today Ashlea was the best server I've ever had in my life.  After my night out last night I really needed a redbull but they don't carry them.  However there is a restaurant next door that does and Ashlea got permission and went over and bought them for my friend and I and made my day.  How many times have you ever had that happen?  Never.  I can't say enough good things about this establishment.   I will continue to frequent here for all my brunch times."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a day date!
At least that what I went for. Our server Tyler was attentive, yet comfortable enough not to be a nuisance. Great happy hour pricing, great atmosphere with live music, and the SHORT RIB TACOS ARE TO DIE FOR! Literally. I almost stabbed a guy about one. With an amazing view of Camelback Mountain, Kitchen 56 is an incredible experience. I'd definitely recommend it for happy hour."}
{"text":"I joined my friends and their family for a birthday graduation! The food was delicious and customer service was great."}
{"text":"Not great. I met a friend for lunch and the place was not busy. That tells you something. The service was really slow and the food was just mediocre. I would not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I want a restaurant to succeed in this location because we live close.  The only thing good was the calamari salad.
Gripe-when u ask what they would suggest and the tell you what is popular.  I want to know what is good no what everyone in phx wants.  

The short ribs w marginal pot roast- at best.
I'm sure if the service was better it could have been abetter experience.  For what we spent there is better food and much friendlier help a mile other directions, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I like this place so much, I'm bummed I don't get to go more often.

All the times I have eaten there, I have never been unhappy with the food, service, or drinks.

The food is always full of flavor -- that calamari salad is unreal.  The short-ribs compete for the best-of in Phoenix.  Sadly, they don't have the duck breast entree anymore -- that was one of my favorite meals in Phoenix period.

The specialty drinks are excellent as well -- I really like the fact that they aren't over-sweet like so many these days -- they strike a great balance of ingredients that elevate the liquor instead of making it something it's not.

Finally the service is spot-on:  friendly, casual, and on-point.  The staff makes every effort to remember familiar faces, and they always seem to go the extra mile to make sure everything is dialed in for the time you spend there.

Solid!

If I *had* to critique something, the only thing that comes to mind is the furniture on the patio -- I just never feel comfortable sitting out there."}
{"text":"I saw this on Check Please AZ on channel 8 I dont live nearby but happened to drive past the other day. I was not disappointed! One of the best burgers I've had! And the fries are legit!"}
{"text":"We have been to Kitchen 56 several times and have had a good experience in the past. I have had the wings, Chicken Piccata, Green Chili Mac, which are all excellent. But today, they were ridiculously busy and short-staffed.  I ordered the pulled pork, but it was not pulled pork. It was pot roast (dry with no sauce). I had my husband try it, and it was very clearly beef. I didn't feel like complaining at the time, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm pretty bummed because I like coming here. Boo."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amy is the best bartender, I believe she said she works Saturday and Monday. Food is great my friend got a BLT which typically is pretty basic but she absolutely loved it. Atmosphere was super cute, it has been remodeled from when I have been there in the past. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food is very sub par at this place and the owners and staff are incredibly rude. I've tried this place out a couple times but when I ended up getting flies in my pizza that was a no go for me. The bartenders drink on the job and it just seems way to pricey for the type of food and service that you get out of this place."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant to get a nice lunch after the botanical garden. It was really good. The Arcadia salad with chicken was amazing. My husband REALLY enjoyed the green Chile burger. The fries were really good also. Nice atmosphere, really nice waitstaff and the food came out in a very timely manner."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome staff. Mark, The manager, remembered us when we've met him only once nearly 5 months ago. This is a family friendly restaurant that has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome place. All the food is good and great selection of drinks. On top of the great food the service was even better. The decor inside is done well and its interesting to think about the transformation from a service station to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Rode our bikes here for happy hour & had $5 wings that were great. Cool joint & Jessika our server was really friendly. Definitely will come back especially since they give a discount for locals that ride their bikes!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place many times and seen cars a plenty in the evening.  Had the opportunity to finally try for a Saturday lunch.  It was not as packed as the evenings seem to be.  

The menu is simple but varied.  The mac & cheese was tempting, also the cinnamon roll sounded delightful.  In the end we tried the 10 oz burger and pulled pork sandwich.  Burger was 2 patties, cooked to perfection with cheese and all the fixings, served w/ fries and coleslaw.  Coleslaw didn't quite get it, dressed was somewhat bland.  The pulled pork was excellent, perfectly seasoned sauce and topped with onion straws.  I chose the green salad option rather than fries.  The salad was just a lettuce combo but the dressing was a light homemade vinegarette, simply perfect.  Maybe my favorite find was the iced tea - freshly brewed, slightly fruity w/ rosehips and other delights, really REALLY good - no sweetener required.

I like the vibe of this place, slightly hip and very comfortable.  Nice background music, bright and cheery w/ natural lighting.  Also outdoor patio area looks fun for cooler days.  The service was outstanding.  I can't wait to come back and try happy hour or maybe dinner."}
{"text":"We've driven by the cute sign countless times and finally stopped by for a visit last Friday. Yelp lists 3 starts as \"A-OK,\" and I think that's an accurate description of our meal here.

We were lucky enough to snag the very last spot in their parking lot (it's a little small) and moseyed in for an early dinner. Very Important Things First: They have my favorite wine of all time on their list! Rockus Bockus! For inquring minds, it's a DELICIOUS juicy red blend and the only other restaurant I've found it is the Grassroots in Scottsdale. Seek it out and love.

After looking over the menu, we realized any options of eating healthy were off the table. We started with the pretzel dippers and cheese dip, which was a TREAT. My husband had the green chili burger that came with some amazing skin-on fries, and I decided to keep blowing it out with the skillet chicken pot pie. The crust was delicious; the filling was tasty but could have used a little more ZING. 

Our server was very sweet and attentive. I do think, like others have pointed out, that the price points for this atmosphere and type of food are a little steep. Still, we walked out happy (stuffed). I would definitely come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Drove along way to try this restaurant and it wasn't worth the trip.  The wait staff was very nice but the service was slow.  They were out of the short ribs which is what we went for.  Was not informed until after we ordered.  Ordered the green Chile burger which came without the green chilies so we paid 3 dollars more than a regular burger for nothing.  Ordered a desert to go and it never came.  At least it wasn't added to the bill. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner spot! I had previously only been here for lunch, but love the simple but strong dinner menu. I had the Salmon (cooked on wood fire oven and served with brown rice, quinoa and cauliflower) and it was amazing, my friend had the Ahi Teriyaki and loved it as well. The portions were reasonable sized and filling, but we managed to save room for the Skillet Cookie and devoured it! Will definitely come back again for dinner...."}
{"text":"Service was great, the food was delish but the mosquito's on the patio had us running for the door before we could finish our food....bummer 'cause I really wanted to try their crème brulee!! We plan on coming back just going to sit inside next time!!"}
{"text":"Food Ok. Subpar service. Found out later that the 'waiter' was the General Manager. Waited over half. An hr for the food, and even later for the check. I. hope this guy doesn't try to cook. He would just drop stuff and leave, like a fly landing on the table, then taking off before you could swat it. He never offered us drinks, and WE had to ask for a desert menus. This place got a lot of hype on check please Arizona, which wasn't earned based on our experience."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.  The happy hour food is A-MA-ZING!  Not exaggerating those caps, either!

We had almost everything - chicken tacos, short rib tacos, edamame, bruschetta, pretzel dippers...then more tacos and pretzel dippers.  It was a first visit for me and everyone else at our table and we all raved about the food.  Great happy hour cocktails and beer selection, too.  As if it couldn't get any better, the service was friendly, professional and efficient.  Really, we couldn't have asked for a better time. 

Best of all, they take online reservations - Yaa! 

All of us agreed we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 has my heart! The food and drinks are aesthetically appealing so you know there is pride in their making. And they are delicious to match!

I went there with my boyfriend last Saturday, for both our first times, and we left so satisfied. We started by ordering a Pickle Back, which I highly recommend! It is a shot of Jameson with a shot of pickle juice to follow. Soo delicious! And to finish, you are given a nice cold PBR. 

The food was great. We ordered the Parmesan Onion dip, with homemade chips! We split the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with a side of their Green Chili Mac and Cheese. Everything came out on time, and was delicious. Our server was so sweet, and it seemed like everyone else working there was as well. 

I left and instantly recommended it to everyone who asked where we ate that night! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I've have had in a long time.  The grilled romaine salad was disgusting, the dressing was overpowering and tried to pass it as a cesear.  I lost my appetite before my pizza arrived.  I ate one slice it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Friendly service. Great food.  Great cocktail/wine/beer offerings. AWESOME patio seating.

I will definitely be back and I will definitely be telling everyone I can about this place and I will definitely be bringing friends.

Great job in making a local restaurant shine!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials. the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks. My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing.

Service was flawless. We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a networking event a couple weeks ago. They had some apps out to try and my friend ordered the quesadilla that was on happy hour. Nothing remarkable about this place food wise. I ordered a moscow mule and it was good.

We were outside on the patio which is super cute. Definitely a great place to have some wine and sit outside and enjoy the perfect weather. 

I need to try the main dishes because I wasn't that impressed with the food we had. We tried their chicken wings, ahi avocado salad of some sort, flatbread and parmesan, and then my frriend's quesadilla. It wasn't that the food was bad, it's just not something that I'm ever gonna think about and be like \"hey, remember xyz at Kitchen 56?\". 

Worth a shot to try but it's just whatever."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review, as more people will be aware of this place and I might not be able to get a table as easy on the weekends again. 

In any event.... Love Kitchen 56. Formerly Vatra, still great feel, great look and great bevs and food! 

We stopped in last Sunday after I took my lady friends and mom by my wedding venue. We were starving, wanted a patio, good wine and a table quickly, Kitchen 56 had all of the above so that is where we headed. I have no idea why they are not busier on Sundays, but whatev, works well for me. 

*Hint: they have happy hour all day on Sunday, wine is cheaper by the glass than by the bottle*

We each ordered yummy glasses of white wine and some lunch. I had the Turkey Panini, yum so good, the garlic aioli is awesome!!! Their fries are ok, nothing to write home about, not worth the calories I don't think. 

Only criticism was that the bartender didn't really seem to know what was going on, she half asses the explanation of happy hour, miss quoted a price on one of the glasses of wine and had to go check on just about everything. We seemed to have like 4 people waiting on us and had to ask for a couple of things more than once. 

But over all had a great time, and will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their Happy Hour menu is amazing! (3pm-6pm) I always come in by myself and he bartenders are always very friendly and inviting. The calamari is very delicious! And the cocktails are always on point :)!"}
{"text":"Not horrible, just incredibly unremarkable.
The iced tea was good.  And though I didn't indulge in a cocktail their drink menu did look enticing.
But then so did their dinner menu...
I split the corn cake appetizer and fig and goat cheese pizza with the husband.
Normally you'd get the appetizer first, but everything came out at once.  No big deal, I mean the server didn't ask and we didn't specify, so really no love lost there, just an observation.  The descriptions of both made them exciting choices.
Then they arrived to our table. Really quickly at least.  The pizza looked good, the appetizer did not.  But whatevs, all looks the same in the end right?
The barbecue sauce used on the pork for the appetizer was too vinegary.  The pork was fine, the corn cakes were ok.  Like the presentation the dish was lackluster.
Same with the pizza.  We have had goat cheese and fig pizzas elsewhere and this one failed to compete.  The blobs of goat cheese were a little gamey for my liking, and rather than use actual figs they chose an overly tart spread, again in globs.  The crust was fine.  boring. 
May be back for a cocktail on the patio,  but dinner will be elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good times, friendly waitress n mgr. Melissa is cool. Compd calamari after finding sum hairs in there. Bought my martini as well. Parm. Chips and drunken bread both good times."}
{"text":"Probably the 90th time I've been here, but I can't say enough good things about it. This time I just stopped in for a beer, and had a wonderful conversation with Jess, the bartender. She recommended a great beer, and I was once again reminded why I love this place. Just a great place with great food and drinks, and super friendly people."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience I've had in a long while...
My husband and I went into Kitchen 56 on the recommendation of a friend. We went in later, around 7:45pm for a very hungry late dinner. We ordered the pretzel bites to start - they were mediocre at best. Main entrees were baked potato with pulled pork and NY Strip. When the food arrived my steak was cold to the touch and I didn't even cut into it - hoping they could just throw it back on the grill for a bit longer without it getting dry. As I waited the 10 minutes of so, my husband dug into his potato to find it was still a bit raw & hard in the center, and commented both the pork and potato were bland and not well-seasoned. My steak arrived for the 2nd time and I cut into the steak I quickly realized it was cooked mid-rare NOT the medium-well I had requested (and told the waitress twice since I know this preparation may not be the \"norm\" for a strip steak). I told the waitress and she had the manager sent over to the table, he offered to have a whole new plate cooked and a free dessert. So now I'm waited another 20 minutes, my husband is completely done with his food, I'm starving and guess what... the steak finally comes out cooked MEDIUM!! I was so frustrated, exhausted, and hungry at this point I just ate around the edges and quickly lost my appetite. The free cookie sundae was the ONLY redeeming thing about this place, but certainly not enough for us to ever return. And just for the cherry on the top - as we were paying a couple walked in and it was about 15 minutes before close - and get this - the manager actually refuse to seat them and them sent them away naming other nearby restaurants!! That action in and of itself really sparks to our overall experience for dinner that night...not worth our time!"}
{"text":"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time. 

I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too. 

I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!"}
{"text":"Kale & quinoa salad with proteins for healthy eaters.  Great selection of adult beverages. Simple but solid menu."}
{"text":"Good menu + happy hour specials, a nice dog friendly patio with live music, weekend brunch is great too.  What's not to like ?"}
{"text":"Really great place overall. Been there for 3 years but just now visiting for the first time since my son has gymnastics at Little Devil around the corner.
Love the building and decor. They have a B&W mural of the corner building when it used to be a gas station. The staff is superb. Even tho they didn't have any crayons, the hostest brought over a dry erase board with markers. The prices are a bit high but the quality of the food deserves it with a small exception.

5 stars from me is just an inch away...

- 1 Star for no changing table in either restroom. Luckily there is a bench in the women's restroom so I had to commandere it for a few minutes. They feature a child's menu so I think it's something for 56 to think about.  They do have booster seats and high chairs.

- 1 Star because my absolutely tasty ahi tuna salad had a few spoiled pieces of lettuce at the bottom. Leads me to speculate they either use prepackaged greens or they're not rotating stock properly.

Thank you 56. Hopefully the lettuce was an isolated incident. I'll be back."}
{"text":"On our spring training visit  to the Phoenix are we decided to stop in to Kitchen 56 for lunch . 
 The restaurant appears to be remodeled and had a a small booth section(which we sat at) an open space with tables n chairs and a small outside patio . The host was very friendly and seated us promptly . I ordered a steak sandwich and my wife had a chicken sandwich which  the waitress said was a off the menu item . I fond both sandwiches delicious and I was surprised at the price for the bottled beer which I thought was very well priced . The food was great the service was great and the only reason for the 4out 5 rating was perhaps the menu itself could have had more selection . But overall the choice to stop and eat at kitchen 56 was win"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Both inside and outside have nice places to sit. The back patio is much nicer than OHSO's. This place has a nicer ambiance and is more family friendly. Food is fantastic. Last night we went for happy hour and loved the drinks and the apps. I also ordered a burger with carmelized onions and mushrooms, which was great! We had excellent, friendly service from the host and our server. I'm surprised this place isn't more busy, being one of the only restaurants smack dab in the middle of Arcadia."}
{"text":"Not to sound like a Toby Keith song but, I love this bar! I heard its where all the coolest Arcadians hang out nowadays."}
{"text":"I loved this place!

Cute, trendy atmosphere. We were seated right away. Server was very attentive and friendly. Food was delicious. Arcadia salad was so good. The short ribs were absolutely delicious - super tender and great flavor. Sister was disappointed with her pizza - didn't have any sauce or oil base and was somewhat dry. Every one else enjoyed their meals. Peanut butter chocolate mousse was fabulous. We would definitely go back here next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I visited Kitchen 56 long ago when they first opened and thought it was pretty good. Never made it back until last week. 

A friend and I went for happy hour. We ordered the garlic cilantro wings, calamari, and the pulled pork sandwich. It wasn't as good as I remembered....

The wings didn't taste very garlic cilantro wings tasted more like plain hot wings. The calamari was good, but the slaw flavors seemed to overpower the calamari. The pulled pork was tasty. 

My friend ordered the back porch lemonade. I thought it was okay, but she wasn't impressed.

The service was really great. The staff was super friendly! Parking lot is small, but there is an overflow lot on the west side of 52nd!"}
{"text":"Second visit confirms that it's probably the nicest converted former gas station I've ever dined in. The views of Camelback mountain and the overall architectural feel of the place can't be faulted. Makes one marvel at the foresight of whomever laid out the original Enco gas station back in 1960 or whenever it was first established. 

Kinda reminds me of the Vig in overall feel, menu, and aesthetic. Not a bad point of comparison at all. There was music on the patio (guitarist doing good covers of things like \"Long Train Running\") that wafted through the open roll-up doors.

The \"Deluxe\" burger is covered in sauteed mushrooms and is fairly good, though I sense that the patty is pre-formed and not hand-formed on site. There are some interesting appetizer items available. 

Service was quick and without complaint.

The wine list is probably the biggest attraction among the offerings, though a full bar is available as well. For happy hour the wines are discounted by $2 per glass. You can get some fairly interesting stuff here (We ordered a bottle of pretty good cab sauv).

I see this place as a destination for Sunday morning bike rides down the canal."}
{"text":"Well it's an a super cute location and setting. However, we were a large party and kids-meals came out fast! Which is great. But the adult food has taken over an hour to get. Making the kids have to sit and wait longer than they needed and require them to sit and behave. (Yes we had entertainment for the kids but there's only so much a kid can do) 
We made reservations and they were all ready and eager to serve us. I felt bad for our server but she never apologized for the long delay. Also the bill was messed up. I suggest this place if your either eating kids meals or your cool with a super long wait for your food."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Live music sometimes, excellent and cheap food at happy hour (try the street fish tacos!) and friendly but quick service."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here one evening to enjoy the Boom56 gathering and I must say, I really really enjoyed this low key gem!! The spicy cilantro wings BANG!!! Lol...looved them. We sat on the patio and it was cool to people watch all the local neighborhood folk. The DJ played lots of house music which gets me going!! Cant wait to go back in 2 weeks for the next Boom56 set :)"}
{"text":"Not the greatest little spot in the world. The food was eh. The service was lousy. My husband asked a question and the waitress was very rude and rose her voice with him. It wasn't necessary and my husband was not being rude so why did she do that?"}
{"text":"Last night, my girlfriends and I went out to dinner...we met at a  restaurant that I had a Groupon for and found a sign on the door that said \"Closed for Renovations\". Totally bummed we decided to go down the street and try Kitchen 56. Let's just say when we left, we all agreed we were glad that the restaurant we were going to go to was closed. Kitchen 56 rocks!! First off I love the ambiance and decor, our waiter was friendly, funny and very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks! I tried his recommendation of the Pink Panther Lemonade and it was amazing with fresh blueberries! One of the other ladies had white wine and was thoroughly impressed. We were even lucky enough to hit happy hour prices!  
We ordered 3 dishes to share... homemade potato chips with a parmesan-onion dip...amazing!! Steak and spinach salad - the dressing was light and tasty and the pieces of steak were incredible! No fat whatsoever and quite a few pieces! Then we got the Acadia Wood Fired Pizza! And it was amazing!! Afterwards, we got the chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream, can we say yummy!! the cookie was warm and gooey and tasted great with the ice cream. I totally recommend this place! The prices are moderate and the food and service is great!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Kitchen 56. Your retro charm, tasty noms and friendly service will definitely keep me coming back. Plus, who doesn't love a sparkling clean restaurant? I know I do.

I met friends for drinks and apps, and we all loved our food and left with some in boxes. The appetizers portion sizes really could be a meal in themselves. Our original plan was to meet at another nearby restaurant but there was no parking- Kitchen 56 definitely has parking to spare. A good amount by the front, then a HUGE lot on the other side of the street.

Drinks were on the spendy side, but we knew we were paying for nice atmosphere, tasty unique drinks like the Green Tea \"Adult Lemonade\" with mashed up strawberries and mint. SO GOOD.

Our waiter was attentive and very friendly, and the manager even came out and visited with us for awhile. 

Overall, this is a great place to meet friends and be able to talk and not compete with loud music or a noisy street. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Arcadia! Great service, food and staff."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. Bartenders are friendly.  Happy hour food is great."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and I just don't understand? 

This place has potential with location,ambiance and staff but the food is horrible.

I wanted to like this place as it's in a great and convenient location. I've been here 4 times and still have not found one thing that's decent on the menu. This last time I was there I had the chicken sandwich on their homemade bread. The chicken was over cooked and the bread was not good either. Everyone in our party did not like their food. For desert they had ice cream, that came out melted and served that way. How do you mess up ice cream?? 

Plenty of restaurants to eat in the neighborhood and unfortunately this one is my least favorite."}
{"text":"I am so happy K56 is open again!  Very different configuration, but it's a lovely redo - and they still have a bigger patio left than I expected.  I ordered to go and sat at the bar to enjoy a cocktail while I waited for my order.  Easy going atmosphere, a delish cocktail (I had the Dromedary - all cocktails have fun, local-themed names), and the to go order was pretty speedy.  

I had ordered the stuffed baked potato to take home to share with my mom (who is recovering from surgery so not wanting to go out).  This is an enormous potato stuffed with really yummy bbq pulled pork... large enough to share.  Sadly, my mother didn't share so well and I didn't get my fair share!  Oh well, now I have to go back again soon :-)"}
{"text":"Great food and great ambiance.  Their ahi tuna sandwich had just right amount of aioli; the turkey burger was tasty, and all the other dishes looked great.  We highly recommend this place as a casual dining place."}
{"text":"I've been putting off coming here for a looong time.  And now I remember why: no good vibes.  Strange atmosphere for a Friday night.  It was better when Vatra was still in this location--and that's not saying a whole lot.

We split the pulled pork on corn cakes for our appetizer, and it was pretty good.  But, my black angus burger I could've made at home--and I'm still not entirely sure there was any alcohol in my adult lemonade.  

Maybe they were lacking music?  I don't remember any music now that I think about it.  Anyway, not a fan.  Probably won't return more than once to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"So, an update from my last review. I had given this place one star for horrible service and so-so food. Since then the restaurant shut down, remodeled and has come back strong. I predict will soon be an Arcadia favorite. 

The service was spot on.  And the food was fantastic. I had the pulled pork. Excellent. The wings are great and I recommend the Thai Sweet Chili on them. My wife had the Avocado toast, also excellent. Careful though, it's a large portion as are all the potions I saw being brought out to tables.  My kids dug the Mac and cheese and the Grilled Cheese sandwich. 

I don't know if the owners or chef are the same but if so, congratulations for turning this place into a great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and the experience was flawless.  Laid back atmosphere, James Taylor-like live music, and the pulled pork sandwich tasted akin to Blue Ridge Pig BBQ from back East AKA best bbq on the planet earth.  The service was friendly and fast.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I drive by here regularly and was excited to check this place out. Cute inside with nice decor but unfortunately the food is overpriced and mediocre. We came for happy hour drinks and dinner. Happy hour drink prices are good and their moscow mules ($5.56) are delicious. Dinner menu is fairly small. Had a Green Chili Angus Burger which was very dry and a side of green chili mac and cheese which was nothing special. May come back for drinks but do not plan on eating here again."}
{"text":"Decent food. Owner was friendly.
I recommed sitting outside to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Dropped in to K56 on a Tuesday after checking out the new Little Woody on Indian School. We grabbed a seat at the bar and attempted to order a glass of wine - Matt the bartender was more than patient with our inability to choose a wine so he poured numerous samples for us! Alas a decision was made and we ordered a bottle, of course!

I've said many times I'm particular about my short ribs... I ordered the Cabernet braised short rib with parsnip puree...Perfectly done, tender, fallin apart good sized portion and seasoned perfectly. Yummm!! My date had the mac 'n cheese and it was delicious! Not too heavy on the cheeze/cream and excellent flavor and al dente shell pasta. Perfect!

Manager Brittney was also very friendly and helpful. She pimped us out with a delicious brownie and vanilla ice cream at the end of our meal. But don't tell anyone!

BOTTOM LINE: I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I got the Wings there 2 weeks ago, it's all I've been thinking about since.  I need to go back ASAP.  They have the perfect char, with the wood fired smokey flavor.  Absolutely amazing!!!  Totally worth the drive all the way from Gilbert.  I've been telling everyone about this place.  Hoping to bring the family there this Saturday."}
{"text":"It actually pains me to rewrite this review because K56 was one of our favorite go-to spots in the area. We anxiously awaited their reopen and it was my first meal after being out of the country for nearly 3 weeks. Only to find out the re-do unfortunately seems to have not worked in our favor. Don't get me wrong, aesthetically the restaurant looks great. They did a good job of updating the decor and design. And while it's much smaller, it's still very pleasing to the eye. Our experience started with a very awkward introduction. We stood at the front for nearly 5 minutes waiting to be seated, we were acknowledged by three different people, but nobody offered to seat us. Until finally a gentleman asked if we had been helped yet, and when we said no, he said he would be back shortly. After we were sat, we sat a good 5-7 minutes until our initial intro with our server. Again, not the end of the world, but a little unusual for typical Kitchen 56 standards that we have experienced in the past! I was sad to see they got rid of the green chile mac and cheese dish! That was a personal favorite. So, We started with the warm spinach salad. It was good, we were pleased with the order. My boyfriend ordered the pork chop, and I ordered the stuffed chicken. The pork chop was one of our favorite dishes on the old menu, one because of flavor, but also because of the generous portion sizing. They have downsized the portion, yet the price remains the same. And his was overdone, even after ordering it medium. The stuffed chicken was just disappointing. It was dry, and overdone with very little to talk about. I was also surprised that for a $20 dish, it did not come with a starch of any kind. Definitely not a reorder, or money well spent in my opinion. Maybe it was just an off night, as we have had consistent positive experiences in the past! But, after two average entrees and a $70 check, this may just be a happy hour stop in spot, and not a date night spot like it was for us for the past few years."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the mixed reviews of this place! I went here with a friend for happy hour and it was fantastic! We each had a drink- I had their mule, which was very tasty and served ice cold in a copper cup and my friend had the blueberry lemonade drink- this was so good! We also shared the short rib tacos and the calamari. The short rib tacos were fantastic! The meat was tender and it was loaded with veg giving it a very fresh taste. The salsa had just the right amount of heat. The portion size was huge (5 tacos), not only for happy hour, but for anytime. It was a great deal for 5.56$. The calamari was also good, but not nearly as good as the tacos. The calamari was fried and tossed with vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce of sorts. It was tasty, but I don't think I would get it again. Despite this, I will definitely be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was really bummed when I heard Kitchen 56 closed. It was relief to hear they were remodeling and revamping the restaurant. They finally reopened a few days ago and I had the pleasure of checking them out during happy hour today. 

It's a much smaller, location, completely different look and what seems to be a new staff. Granted I did not eat anything, and just had a drink. I really like the new vibe. It feels more intimate and something out of San Francisco. The staff was super friendly and almost pumped to be apart of the new kitchen 56. The bartender with the short platinum hair was really sweet and instantly made me feel like she's been serving me for years. From what I can tell they still have a great patio. Definitely smaller, which I like. I'm excited to come back and check out the food menu. Sometimes change is good. And that definitely seems to be the case here."}
{"text":"Solid all around! 
Great service! I had a double black angus burger and fries and it was very good. My fiancé had the calamari and it was a huge portion that she really liked. We absolutely recommend Kitchen 56."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Loved everything. Fantastic happy hour outing - the drinks we sampled blew us all away. ( try the black cherry, pink panther or green tea adult lemonade- two thumbs up for all!) They really have some fantastic cocktails. 
We tried the potato skins, tacos, calamari, corn fritters and green chili Mac and cheese. Everything was phenomenal, fresh and delicious. Good portions, great happy hour prices and super tasty!
The patio and inside are both comfortable and cutely decorated - noise level was average and we noticed that the crowd was perfectly eclectic -  little bit of every type. The service was great (special note that all the male servers are pretty easy on the eyes - love it)!
We came early and by the time we left, there as a full house and things were getting a bit more hectic. I would suggest hitting the place for happy hour and going from there.
Planning a return visit for next month already!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute.  It's an old gas station remodeled into a retro, casual restaurant.  They have a fantastic happy hour menu which includes drink specials and a menu of $5 appetizers.  We all tried one of their specialty adult lemonade drinks.  They were delicious and refreshing. Whatever you do, make sure you order the happy tacos. Both the fish & short rib tacos were AMAZING.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my bf. If you bike here or walk, they give a 20% discount or something. Check in on foursquare and use your amex card for 5$ off.

 It was a casual afternoon. I had the trout and he had the happy hour fish and chips. Our food was delicious. I think the only thing I had a bit of complaint was I felt a bit rushed. However, the food and drinks are amazing. The fish and chips were fresh and so crispy. The trout dish had green beans and peanuts. I ordered mash as a side too. Fish was seasoned perfectly and green beans were crunchy not soggy. 

 Overall,  I had a great experience and will return!"}
{"text":"Kitchen 56 is right down the street from my house and I love going here for a bite to eat and a drink. Friendly staff and really good food. The wings are excellent. The drink menu is pretty extensive too. Can get a good buzz going for the price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for happy hour, but their happy hours is very good.  They have draft beer and there are a variety of appetizers on the happy hour menu for cheap that are all very tasty.  It is a comfortable place to eat - open, high ceilings, nice decor - and the staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"The boys and I were out at the Papago jump park; working up an appetite. We decided on something with A) beer and B) between our two places. We all had never been to Kitchen 56, so we thought we give it a go. When we arrived, the place was dead. However, the waitress and bartender were both ignoring us and it took about 20 minutes to get drinks. I was stoked that they served pbr in the can. The lunch menu looked amazing and we all got something different. I ordered the chorizo burrito which was tasty and not too greasy and the beau ordered the pulled pork which was delicious minus the generic bun. Our friends said their food was excellent but the service was slow and in an almost dead restaurant that is unacceptable. Our waitress came back about 30 minutes after our food arrived and we were all through our beers and would've ordered more if there hadn't been such a long delay but at that point we just wanted to get on with our day. Next time, we'll just order take out and skip the poor service."}
{"text":"Ate here at lunch with a group of 30. Everyone ordered something different. Staff was very efficient and polite. Nice menu and food was good.  If back in the area will be back"}
{"text":"I Guess You Have To Like Their Chili Rub. Me, Not So Much...

I stopped in for Brunch when I spotted Kitchen 56 on a Saturday around 10:45 am. I had no idea what to expect, but entered with an open mind.

There weren't very many brunch items, but several of their lunch items were listed on the brunch menu. None of them appealed to me, so I decided to keep it basic. 

When I asked my server about the Kitchen 56 Scramble of the day, she indicated that the chef's scramble ingredients of the day were bacon (got my attention), mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese. She indicated that the scramble was then served on a bed of crisp O'Brien potatoes with peppers and onions. That sounded like a good choice, so I selected it, and settled in to wait.

Looking around, I found the décor very pleasant and inviting. Although I wasn't drinking that early, the drink menu looked really interesting. They had specials on Bloody Marys, Mimosas, and Grapefruit Mint Bellini's. I tucked that information away for the future.

My food arrived quickly, and was very hot. The portion was generous, and I could tell it was far more than I could manage to eat. The scramble was tasty, although I didn't understand the addition of thinly sliced potatoes to the scramble, when it was served on a bed of O'Brien potatoes. The O'Brien potatoes, unfortunately, were a bit salty, and had was flavored with a seasoning that I didn't like at all with the scramble. I had to leave the potatoes alone as they were ruining my scramble, and in fact, caused me to stop eating all together. 

When my server cane around, and I asked her what the seasoning was, she indicated that the potatoes were seasoned with their \"Kitchen 56 Chili rub\". As soon as she said Chili, I could peg the taste. When I indicated my dislike of it, she did offer to bring me some more potatoes with none of the seasoning, but by then the flavor had gotten into the scramble and ruined my experience.

Service was good, the environment was pleasant, the prices were a touch on the high side, but overall it seems like a nice place. Unfortunately, I think that they rely on their chili rub in a number of their dishes. Since I don't like it, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"1st visit.  Not too bad. Wings were good. Serving portions were a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"So, my husband and I went to kitchen 56 for our anniversary on monday night around 6pm or so. We were immediately impressed with the ambience when we walked in, although we opted to dine on the large outdoor patio out back. Because I did my research before hand, I already knew that I wanted to try the cucumber basil lemonade and it didn't disappoint! We decided on the drunken bread a our appetizer, a recommendation from the very friendly and attentive waiter. I cannot remember his name for the life of me, but if you see a man with strawberry blonde hair, ask to sit at one of his tables. My husband knew what he was going to order before we arrived so he only took a quick glance at the menu before he quickly devoured the majority of the deliciously cheesy and herbaceous bread. As for myself, I usually have trouble deciding what I want, and when I asked the waiter what he recommended, he told me that one of, the dishes I was debating on was actually his favorite, so I ordered the papardelle with slow roasted pork sauce. The homemade pasta was tender and fresh and the herbed ricotta added a nice creaminess to the dish. The meat was also very tender and flavorful. I don't eat much meat so towards the end of my meal, I found myself fishing around for more of the noodles. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal, the steak was juicy and fork tender, and the chimichuri was delicious! Once we were finished, our waiter promptly cleared our plates and brought the check. It was what we expected to pay to eat out in this part of town, but for what it was, it was on the pricey side for sure. I think on my next visit, I'll stick to cocktails and appetizers by the firepit with some good friends. :-)"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Service was better than average.  I was there for happy hour, and found the prices reasonable, and the chicken wings I had were tasting, and a good value.

I don't know much about this place other than the one visit today, but this one experience is fairly positive.

Seems like there is a nice regular crowd."}
{"text":"Nice patio overlooking Camelback Mountain. Unfortunately the flies were so aggressive we had to move to a table inside midway through our meal. 

Took advantage of the Happy Hour menu and tried a bunch of the apps. Here is my impression of each:

Chicken tacos- kinda dry and needed a dipping sauce. Over abundance of weird lettuce filling and not much else other than little chunks of chicken.

Soft pretzels- ok. Not the best in this region. Dipping sauce was also just ok. 

Chicken wings - pretty good. Unique flavor. 

Calamari- ok. No dipping sauce but came with a red pepper drizzle. Not super flavorful. 

Overall the food was nothing spectacular. Outdoor ambience would've been nice if the flies weren't attacking us. Indoor is cute."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL PATIO and Service! 

We just came in for a quick glass of wine and enjoyed our time here. The patio has an amazing view of Camelback and is perfect for happy hour. We tried their cheese and meat plate and were very surprised at the portion they gave for $14. 

I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner. We started with the pulled pork on corn cakes. Delicious! My husband had the smoked salmon pizza and I have the macaroni and cheese. The pizza was wonderful, the mac and cheese needed a pit more seasoning, but was creamy and satisfying nonetheless. We had the sticky toffee cake for dessert. I bake, so I have high standards for dessert. This was a little lackluster. I'd skip dessert next time. 

Overall, a pleasant experience, good service, nice atmosphere and a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Two friends of mine and I were stuck at the stoplight at 56th street and Indian School. Windows rolled down, we smelled the a barbecue grill and saw one of the cutest little patios ever...so naturally we decided to ditch the day's plans and get a bite to eat.
Fabulously enough, it happened to be happy hour- which they do everyday! We all got cocktails for $5.56 and plates for the same amount.
Garlic cilantro wings are good, they come out crispy, hot and with a little flavor of the grill. Not really that spicy but really yummy. Huge portion for a little over five bucks.
We also had short rib tacos, good but nothing super impressive. Drinks were killer though- back porch lemonade, pink panther and green tea. They seem nice and harmless but they do pack a little punch. The vibe on the patio is great and the soundtrack there is on point! Visit for happy hour, it's a great deal."}
