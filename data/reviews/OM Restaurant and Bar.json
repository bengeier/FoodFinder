{"text":"I was reluctant to write a review because I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself. Never have I ever had a meal where we paid slightly over 40 (!!) dollars for three people -  with food being so flavourful and delicious. This place is a magical gem, it transports you to Tibet and soothes your soul, mind and stomach. I recommend momos, guyma sausage, stir fries, okra and freshly baked naan. We are definitely going back soon. Thank you, Om!"}
{"text":"My favourite local take out!   I order mostly Indian dishes: chicken or beef korma, karahi, vindaloo, saag..veggie dishes: chana nasal, navaratan makhini,  pakoras. Naan is great. But most of all, their service is so pleasant, whether it's take out or dine in. Reasonable prices, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place was a fantastic! Loads of great food and the price was right! Great service, nice chill patio environment. Well worth the trip to Parkdale. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The onion bhajis were exemplary! The aloo mushrooms were also quite flavorful. Service was good."}
{"text":"This place is a great Parkdale gem, freshly baked naan, the best tikka masala and the loveliest wait staff keep me going back."}
{"text":"Tasty North Indian and Tibetan food. I have tried mostly everything from their menu including momos (Tibetan dumplings) and various kinds of north Indian dishes. Appropriately spiced and delicious accompaniment with butter naans. The food is somewhere between outstanding and mediocre, same goes for the service.  Secret tip: They have lime-n-lemony Limca, Thums Up taste-the-thunder and such classic Indian soft drinks."}
{"text":"OM was my introduction to Tibetan cuisine and I must say, I am a huge fan.  The food here is fresh, flavourful and so cheap!  The service has always been good, and although I've not had a chance to check it out, their back patio looks really cozy."}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant countless of times and never noticed it. Shame on me. OM offers traditional Tibetan fare as well as some Tibetan style Indian food. Here you can find dishes such as chili chicken, vindaloos, etc... but they are all done Tibetan style, and this is a very good thing :)   We got the Jasha MOMO which is a chicken dumpling. Very similar to Chinese dumplings, except the skin is thicker. These were very good and you get a good portion (about 7 pcs) in one order.   The Chicken Vindaloo was also very good. Different from traditional Indian style Vindaloo as this one was tangier and less spicy but it was still truly delicious. The chicken pieces in the sauce were tender and juicy and this dish came with a portion of rice.   The chili pork was awesome! I think it was my favourite part of the meal (and I'm not a huge pork fan). The dish was made of pork belly and was spicy,tender,fatty and totally addicting. I never knew pork belly could be this good!   Service was very friendly and attentive but not intrusive or overbearing, our server ( I think it also was the owner) always had a smile for us and was overall very pleasant.   I had a great time eating here and of course the company of fellow yelpers just made the experience that much better! :) I definitely recommend giving this little gem in Parkdale a try!"}
{"text":"This was our fourth visit to OM Restaurant.  I'm still a fan.  Of course, we had to order the garlic naan again, not one but two orders.  We love that they came out hot from the oven and straight to our table -- so tasty, light and fluffy. (10/10)  Chili Chicken.  Fried chicken saut√©ed with tomato, onion, ginger, garlic and green chili.  I loved the sauce and couldn't stop dipping in it with garlic naan. (7/10)  Beef Karahi.  We ordered this dish for the first time.  Beef had been cooked and simmered in spices.  It was very good and tender. (7/10)  Service was excellent as always.  They take phone orders:  416-532-3901.  I counted 12 vegetarian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I really love OM (especially the back patio in the summer). The service is what really makes this place special as they treat you so well and make sure you're having a great meal. The food is also delicious - some of my favourite momos in the area!"}
{"text":"Great taste of food. Ordered steamed chicken MoMos. The flour layer on momo is not thick unlike other Tibetan restaurants in the area. Which is a good thing.  Stir fried noodles was good as well as the vegetarian okra dish. 4 star only because the quantity was less for the price. ( noodles and vegetarian dish)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. The food is amazing and the price is so low. It makes me wonder why even eat anywhere else? This is without a doubt my new home away from home.  Lunch specials are only $5 and change all the time. you could really just have it every day, yum!"}
{"text":"Last night I had the pleasure of trying a variety of hot and flavourful dishes. This is definitely a place where I recommend that you come with a group because their dish sozes are the best for sharing, and you're going to want to try more than one kind of cuisine. Definitely plan on coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"**3.5stars**  This place was a warm welcome on a cold day after we found out that Tibet Kitchen (TK) was closed.   We entered and were promptly seated by a smiling waiter. We ordered:  1.Hot and Sour Soup: This was really good! 2.Tibet Tea: There was no description of it and I didn't realize it had butter and salt. Not my style! Masala Chai anyway for me 3.Chicken and Beef Momo: Although the outer cover was a bit too thick for my liking, the filling was amazing. The mix of flavours was very different for what I had tried anywhere. It was also pretty filling.(Beef was my favourite along with their homemade sauce!) 4. Beef Tripe: Good but not as good as TK's 5. Chilly Chicken: Ok, TK's is better. 6. Rice: Amazing (I know its just rice but I really liked the colourful basmati that was really week cooked)  Overall, I don't know if I'll go back for the Tibetan cuisine but the rice tasted so good that I really want to go try their North-Indian food."}
{"text":"Been to OM Many times.  Very happy with the quality.  Food is very tasty.  Have dined in several times with good service and have done takeout a few times. Garlic naan is delish.  Lamb vindaloo is nice and tender.  Butter chicken is great.  And the vegetable pakoras are about the best I've ever had.  If I had to give one critique it would be that the portion sizes could be a little bigger.   Overall, visit this place."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say I've been going to this restaurant for the past 7 years since I've been in high school. Very friendly staff and proportions of food are generous. I love going for their lunch specials because it's only $7 and for students its $5! The lunch special depends on the day so they either have your choice of chicken/beef/goat with chickpeas/lentil/zucchini and potatoes and it always comes with rice and salad.   I have ordered off the dinner menu and it's reasonably priced. My friend and I ordered a plate of garlic naan bread, chicken tikka masala, butter chicken and a bowl of rice and it all came to around 25$ which is a steal because we were both more than full at the end. There's always been leftovers for me to take home. The atmosphere is very peaceful and a good time to enjoy your meal with friends and or family. They've upgraded their furniture as well the past couple years and in the summer they open up the patio in the back which is also great! I'm forever a loyal customer. Om is definitely one of my favourite food spots for Indian food."}
{"text":"Great place, we had the tandoori shrimp, tandoori chicken, beef momo's, naan, butter chicken, rice and these pastry dumplings.  Seemed like a lot of food but we finished it all but one dumpling which we took home. 5 stars food 3 stars ambiance 5 stars attitude  Will return soon to treat some friends coming to town."}
{"text":"I took a group of 15 here last night for a birthday dinner and it was just great! The staff were friendly and helpful from the moment I called to make a reservation to the minute we left. The food was delicious and affordable and the menu had plenty of veggie options. The gentleman who served us gave us lots of good suggestions and the kitchen even sent out an ice cream cake with a candle at the end of our meal! There's also a patio out back that would be really lovely on a summer evening. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and had a great experience each time. It's warm and cozy inside, and the servers are so nice. They always make me feel good about my choices too.  The menu is half Indian and half Tibetan. I always order at least some things from the Tibetan side because it's in Little Tibet afterall. Plus I've enjoyed all the Tibet dishes I've had here :)  Tonight we had a combination of items from each side of the menu:  Lamb Rogan Josh - delicious, nice tender chunks of lamb in a creamy sauce Rice - average, ordered this to go with the lamb Paneer Naan - YUM! get this get this get this. Served hot and fresh with cheese inside. Beef Momos - like beef dumplings, except more firm and with a thicker shell. Comfort food. Theinthuk - hand-pulled pasta in a beef broth - I really liked this. It's hearty and the pasta definitely tastes homemade. The pasta is similar to the shell of the momo. The beef is kind of meh but to me the pasta and broth are the stars of the show.  It was definitely too much food for two people. We could have skipped the naan or the momos and still been satisfied, but how can you skip naan and momos???"}
{"text":"Amazing prices (student friendly) for the quality and quantity of food. I like the set up of the restaurant too! Possibly my favourite restaurant in the Parkdale area. I had the vegetarian lunch special. The portion size was quite big, and it wasn't oily at all like how some other restaurants prepare it."}
{"text":"Ummm.. uhhh... Om..   This place has been on my TDL (To do list) for a while now and on a whim went tonight.  Om err.. was not exactly Omnomerific, but that might have been because of what we ordered vs the general quality of the place.  We shared a sizzling meat platter + an order of Beef Dumplings and a side of Garlic Naan.  I think I had the same issue with both dishes, that both were a bit bland.  While the Beef dumplings came with a tasty chilli sauce, the sizzling platter (Chicken Tandoori, fried hard tofu, and a tibetan sausage) smelled awesome, but all were just a tad dry.    The naan that came with the sizzling platter and our extra order of garlic naan was yummie, but it was really craving something with sauce.  Om is exactly the type of hole in the wall type mom and pop place that I'd love to blow up and be a success (much like Khmer Thai last year).  The service was ok, as the whole place was being taken care of by one guy (most likely the owner).  I think there's really good potential here, and  will definitely have to do it again.  Maybe next time with a bigger group (UYE anyone?) so that we can sample a few more dishes.  I think the 3 star rating is more a place mark until I go back.  I so desperately want to fall in love with this place.  It's kind like dating a very boring hot chick.  Just praying there's something more interesting the next time.  Like Luda says.. I'm hoping this chick bad, this chick hood, I hope this chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could.    So for now, I'm going to have to just wait for my next OmNomNom experience."}
{"text":"I was once an Om defender. A defender of the Om. Om's ally, if you will.  No longer, unfortunately.   It's a sad situation. It used to be my go-to place for curry binges, but over the last year I watched the quality go from great, to hit and miss, to greasy and bland. It's unfortunate because I find it very difficult to find consistently good Indian/Nepalese/Tibetan food in the west end. (I'm open to recommendations!)"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here recently.  The food was really fresh and delicious.  My kids love momos and we love Indian food so it was a great choice for takeout.  The food was ready in about 20 minutes and they were very friendly when I came to pick it up.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of a lot of places, it seems. This one is no exception.   Great back patio, good prices and great food.  We ordered a couple of beers, butter chicken, garlic naan and rice. All were awesome and we left full, AND with a little bit of leftovers.   Check the back patio, it's a little hidden gem. Service was great and friendly and I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Loved it and been back a few times since I first discovered this spot last year. Great service and great food, cant beat that!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood of where OM is located and naturally it is a restaurant that my family and I most often visit when we are hungry!   I order food here mostly to go, meaning that around lunch time on the weekdays (from 11 to 3 I believe) they have these lunch specials that they provide for customers and students such as myself. They are always under $8 and they always provide a heaping amount of food! Every day of the week they offer a different selection of vege sides and meats. I would recommend going on Wednesdays and Fridays as they serve goat meat (which is my favourite) during those days if my memory serves right.      In terms of dinner foods, most of the time we call the restaurant to order the food and afterwards we come pick it up and eat it at home. My favourite dishes to order from OM are the \"Shahi Shrimp,\" \"Butter Chicken,\" \"Chana Masala\" and of course the secret \"Goat Curry\" that seems to be only available on certain days of the week. All of these dishes are amazing and my family frequently orders them because they are just that good!   As for dining in the restaurant, the inside is very homely and warm. Tibetan and tranquil music plays in the air as you order and eat. They have a patio that is open in the late spring to summer and it's a very nice experience dining outside.  The service at OM is amazing! Because I order here often, the owners know my face well and they are the sweetest people. They genuinely want to make your dining experience a comfortable and enjoyable one. Their food is always cooked with love and this is a place that I hold dearly in my heart."}
{"text":"We must have seen this restaurant on a random trip a few months back, and remembered it on our way to the Ossington Strip. Walked in - it was a bit cold, but they made a big effort to make it warm in the restaurant. As vegetarians, we ordered: Veggie noodle soup - Was pretty amazing, and a full portion Veggie Steamed buns - tasty and made on the premise Navratam makhni - normally I really dislike sweet indian meals, but this was pretty amazing..  Yes - I will be back"}
{"text":"This was MY first visit to OM Restaurant.  I'm still A-OKAY(Survived).  3.5 *Star*  Of course, we had to order the Jasha Momo($6.99), not two but one order.  We love that they came out with Spicy Hot Sauce from being steamed and straight to our table -- so spicy, red and HOT. (7.50/10.00)  Chili Pork($8.99).  Fried Porkbelly saut√©ed with Tomato, Onion, Ginger, Garlic and Green Chili.  I liked the sauce and COULD stop dipping in it with Garlic Naan. (8.50/10.00)  Chicken Vindaloo($8.99).  We ordered this dish for the first time.  Chicken had been cooked and simmered in spices.  It was aight and tender. (7.00/10.00)"}
{"text":"A good option, but neither what I'd consider to be the best Tibetan or Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood. It is however, a very affordable place with good food, and the ambiance is better than a lot of the Tibetan restaurants in the area. Apparently it even has a patio for summertime enjoyment.  Food experiences: Veg Pakoras ($4.99) are a nice starter. Tasty balls of fried veggies served with both tamarind and mint sauce to dip in.  They have momo's (a Tibetan staple) but seemed they only offered steamed momo's, where I'm a fried momo's kind of guy so we skipped those and over-ordered on main dishes instead. The Stir Fried Noodles w/ Chicken ($8.99) and Vegetables (+ $1 to add) was our favourite of the main dishes. Quality noodles and a large portion. The Chili Chicken w/ rice ($8.99) was a bit of a let down. We ordered it \"medium, with sauce\". It was very mild, and the breading wasn't our favourite. Would skip next time. We also had the Baingan Bharta ($9.99) which is mashed up eggplant with various spices mixed in. This tasted great on both rice as well as naan (and even better with hot sauce added too), however will say that it didn't provide the value that the other dishes did.  Drinks are super reasonable - $4.99 for a Heineken/Stella/Corona and $5.99 for 6 oz glasses of wine.   After tax and before tip, we got out of there for around $50 while also leaving with leftovers. All in all, a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying Tibetan food, so I didn't know what to expect. However, for the most part I was pretty satisfied. My wife and I ordered the Indian onion bhajia for an appetizer which was good. We then split the steamed chicken dumpling which was a little dry, and phingsha a noodle soup with vegetables and beef. We both loved the soup. As for the service we went on a Sunday evening and were the only people there so no complaints. Definitely going to try more Tibetan food in the future"}
{"text":"This place is just great! We walked in, got seated right away by the friendliest hostess, ordered, and got our delicious food all within 15 mins!! They have tibetan and indian food, with many meat and veggie options!! Super friendly and attentive service, i will def be back!"}
{"text":"I am a yoga fan. I am a fan of OM chant. I am not a fan of this restaurant.  I have watched businesses drop away from this spot like flies for last few years until this one. Since it stuck around for longer then most, I figured that it must be good.  uhhh No. Maybe it's me. Maybe we're just not meant to be. Maybe this is what I get for expecting wonderful Indian food from Tibetan restaurant - but I'm allowed to expect that in a city like Toronto, where the Chinese owned sushi spots rule my books - can't I?  It could be that the build up was so big and the crash was so hard that I never recovered. I love the cozy atmosphere of this place - it's just dim enough. It's warm colours go well with the cozy feeling and the music. I had my first meal there and I got sick. Maybe it was because I only had a sandwich all day  and the spices didn't like me so much that day  - I dunno.   The second time I had the food to go. This in itself was an interesting experience as the waiter refused to give me a specific time as to when the food would be ready. It was always \"soon\" which turned out to be 15 minutes. I felt that the price reasonable - I had paid about the same for some DELICIOUS butter chicken from Banjara and Dhaba -  until I ate it. Then, the price became ridiculous.  First of all - I don't know where the butter went, in the BUTTER chicken. There was a lot of tomato - in fact, it should have been called Tomato chicken. There definitely was some butter in the Butter Naan - but it made the Naan hard, chewy but not complementary to the food.  Normally, I have serious dilemma of having to remember to eat both Naan and chicken (and not just one or the other) ,as well as ration my Butter Naan so it doesn't run out before the Butter chicken is at least 2/3 done. With this food - I was wondering how much of the food I was willing to throw out and cut my losses.  I normally have a 3 tries rule - I try at least 3 times. Not this place. Apparently, Indian food is made best by Indians."}
{"text":"Straight to the point reviews! Liked: friendly staff, momos were amazing (get the half steamed / half fried) and the Indian food was awesome as well.   Disliked: not much beyond a few wasps on the patio and it was a bit slow for us to get our food packed up.   A+ overall"}
{"text":"Was never really a fan of Indian food but the butter chicken served here won me over. Perfect blend of sweet and savoury, and the naan? Amazing! Looking forward to trying the Tibetan next time."}
{"text":"Man I really shouldn't  be writing reviews when I'm hungry. But alas gotta clear some photos on my phone so here I go.   About a month ago, I was craving chicken and decided on trying chicken momos from Om. Oh boy, they were so incredibly tasty! If only I could have them in my mouth and belly right now, I'd be satisfied!   They are the perfect balance of chicken and dough and they come with this nice lime chili sauce... Stupendous! There's also this extra speciality which comes from it being made with love. You can taste it! The resto has a warm ambiance as well; welcoming. They also have prayer flags up top and it adds to their ethos and aesthetics.   I'm gonna have to go there tomorrow, that's just the conclusion I've come to!"}
{"text":"On a weeknight when a girlfriend and I met up for an early dinner at OM, we couldn't help but notice that all of the other patrons were male. It didn't bother us, but we definitely made note of this as well as the fact that many of them seemed to be regulars. In any case, we were quickly greeted upon entering and provided with very pleasant service throughout our meal.   We shared the fish curry which was a spicy tomato sauce featuring generous chunks of white fish, the palak paneer featuring large cubes of the homemade cheese, fluffy butter naan, and flavourfully spiced peas pulao.   A half litre of their house wine (for just $9.99!) made for a cheap and cheerful accompaniment."}
{"text":"x2 what Tony said.  Pretty good but not quite sure it's worth the drive to Parkdale (hyuk-yuk)  The beef dumplings were fairly hideous. Thick skinned and bland, not fresh tasting whatsoever.  The Sample Sizzler platter thing was decent. $12.99 for a large naan and a sample plate with tandoori chicken pieces, tandoori tofu, and some beef sausage.  Everything about this place was just completely 3 stars, I really can't find fault with anything but there was no OMNOMNOM factor.  I did, however, enjoy the gossip."}
{"text":"I can't even. There are no words to describe how tasty this place is.  I remember having an opinion on decor and location in precisely the way one remembers their first time eating cake.  It's buried deep inside somewhere but it's really kinda a blur burned into my mind by the stories told after the fact.    Quaint? Not huge. There may have been a patio?  All I remember is eating the best vindaloo of my life, then there was garlic naan, and some kind of blood sausage, and these existential dumplings.  There was paneer in there. The naan never stopped flowing and and at the end I was handed a bill which I paid happily, knowing what it was to have transcended heaven and earth, to slip the bounds of mere mortality and joined eternity among a small ceramic ramicam of hot chilli sauce.    I think I paid cash?  Might have been my immortal soul. Not sure. Either way I was impressed by the value.  Also the table next to us had pakora which looked really really good.  I'm going to try that next time."}
{"text":"OM Restaurant has the honour to be my 500th yelp's reviews.  Om Restaurant serves both Indian and Tibetan Food.   This is my first experience with Tibetan food.   Jasha MOMO = Dumplings (Tibet), Devil (Filipino) My dog (in my world) The momo here is quite good. The stick is a little thicker than the Chinese ones I used to and they are less juicy/soupy. I am of course a fan of the spicy sauce.   Masala Chai = Indian Milk Tea with Indian Spice and Herb The Indian Milk Tea is really rich and milky which give it a nice and silky texture. It really reminds me of the HK style Milk Tea I enjoy. The only difference is the touch of ginger and cardamom. Of course the whole milk and the sweetener here is heated together over the stove. I love it! (I am not thinking about fat content and calories!)  Chicken Vindaloo not equal to Chicken Curry. Vindaloo suppose to be the King of Curries which is actually Portuguese in origin. when it arrives in Goa, India it had been modified by adding plentiful amounts of traditional spice and using malt vinegar instead of red wine. I love the spice inside! Not just hot but has depth in it.  Chilli Pork = a Tibetan dish makes with Pork Belly which 80% is fat cooked in more chilli oil with real hot pepper. Pork Belly is the fattest part of a pig and for some it is the most flavoured and yummy part. It is spicy for sure and I really enjoyed eating the fresh pepper inside. I hope someone would thinks those are green onions and just eat them by mistakes!  Thanks for my fellow yelpers making my 500th yelp reviews so special. Not only organizing a food crawl in somewhere I never been Parkdale, Taking me to new places, Trying out new food, sharing my meals, laughters and a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Really good size portions and the food is interesting - lots of cilantro, and the dumpling sauce is great. The price is good too for the quality and quantity of the food. The decor is simple and clean. The service is pretty slow though."}
{"text":"A couple words about OM: it's super clean, nice ambience, the staff are super friendly, the prices are SUPER reasonable (where else can you get dinner for $6?!), and I love how this seems to be a favourite hangout spot for the Tibetan community.  I also like how they offer Indian food.    However, as my second ever Tibetan food experience I've come to realize that I'm not a huge Tibetan food fan.  If I was, I would definitely give this place 5 stars.    We ordered momos - usually I'm a dumpling fan but perhaps being raised on Cantonese-style dumplings and gyoza I find momos to be slightly bland - the vegetable ones were very perogy like with a very thick skin and the chicken ones were almost like the Cantonese ones, again except for the skin.  I did however, enjoy the hot sauce on the side.    Mango lassis were great, and we also ordered fish pakoras which were a tad like eating fish sticks (except with a tiny bit more spice.)  - they were unfortunately, slightly soggy.  I would give a higher rating to OM but I felt that the food could be slightly improved."}
{"text":"Most excellent food and service at OM, as always! The team this evening was incredibly warm and the curries were tasty. Thank you for your care and expertise!"}
