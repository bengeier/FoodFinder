{"text":"We stopped on our way out of town for Breakfast.  Our Hostess seated us right away. And once our waitress came to take drink orders 10min. Later. Service was good and we received our food pretty quickly. Both girls were excellent..very friendly.  Breakfast was very Good for the most part. We were a party of 3. 2 of us had ham, cheese, pepper,  mushroom  omelets, The other had a Veggy Eggs Benedict with avocado. All 3 were very good. The bad part was the breakfast potatoes that came with your meal. Awful...you have such a nice presentation of food and then these awful potatoes that look like they just opened a bag of frozen potato cubes!! That being said...we all just pushed those aside and made room for the Lemon Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes we shared!!! Excellent!! Probably one of the. Best pancakes we have ever had.  So we are going to give this breakfast experience an 71/2 to 8.  We travel a lot so have a few suggestions for the establishment : #1: Get rid of those things you call potatoes!!  #2: Get some bus people!!! We notice the waitress'  were busing their own tables, getting waters, pouring coffee, doing the checks!! We had different server bring out food. (Maybe it was because our waitress was pregnant) but I couldn't believe they were having them all bus their own tables. Probably why it took  awhile to get  our bill and pay.  Would we go back...yes. The pancakes alone made it worth the experience! :D"}
{"text":"With the full understanding that \"best burger\" is something that is very subjective and with the further understanding that, at the end of the day, it's just ground beef, I still have to say, Burgers & Brew is just AMAZING.  I've been to Vegas dozens of times, but I finally stayed at the M, and have now dined at Burgers & Brew three times. That's how I am, I find something I love and I get in a rut.  My first experience was the Cuban Burger.  10 oz great tasting patty, topped by a MOUND of delicious pulled pork, layered with swiss cheese, sliced ham, sliced pickles and a pilsner-infused mustard.  IT IS AMAZING.  I complimented that with the Cheddar and Bacon Fries which were also fantastic. Maybe not differentiating (I've had better fries in Vegas, but these were solid).  Bring an appetite or somebody to share with, because this is A LOT of food. I barely made it through half the burger in any of my visits.  By the way, there breakfasts are also very good, and a great value, which is surprising these days in Vegas.  Fantastic service, and a great view from a floor-to-ceiling window looking toward the Strip in the distance, all make this a fabulous place to dine.  I would totally recommend Burgers & Brew - even if you're staying on the strip, I'd recommend taking a cab or driving out to the M to partake. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the worst service experiences I can think of. No warm up for my friends coffee. No refill for my soda. And didn't ever receive what I ordered to go after our meal. We went there for thanksgiving dinner which was alright. But the service was awful."}
{"text":"My son was in town so went to Burger n Bree at the M which is close to my home. The restaurant was bright n furnished nicely. The menu is a burger fan delight. I ordered the stout burger n my son had the imperial. We're quite satisfied with the burgers. Fries served in the cone basket was a nice presentation but prefer when fries are piled high on a plate. Prices were reasonable n beer was cold. I would return."}
{"text":"I went to this great eatery inside the M casino. I was blown away by the service and food. Eric was my server and he was so attentive and I wanted for nothing. I think he was a good mid-western boy North Dakota, I think is where he was from. Anyway the place was packed and the vibe was really cool. If you go to the M and want a burger hit this spot up."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers & gourmet fries and a nice selection of beers. Nice, but still casual, atmosphere. Cool patio overlooking the pool, with pretty good views of Las Vegas & The Strip, especially at night. Good place to take out of town guests if you are looking for somewhere other than Downtown or Strip. I've eaten here several times and am never disappointed with the food. Will admit the service is sometimes hit or miss. Have had waiters forget to come back to check on our table on a couple of occasions, but nothing too terrible. The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was ok..but the service was non -existent. The server never took the menus from the table I did put it under my chair while I ate. We sat with dirty appetizer plates at our table so finally the food runner took them away when he's brought our main entr√©es. When we finally got our water is refilled it was refilled with luke warm water had that I've been sitting out all night. Gee thanks!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch.  Location has a nice view of the pool.   They had a good selection of bottled beers but nothing on tap.  Ordered the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich.  Nice flavors but a little greasy.  Salt and Pepper Fries were average.   Friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"This was actually my groups third choice as far as eating today. Unfortunately the pool was closed and the Hash House is gone. We arrived after the lunch crowd and we're asked to wait for a table that was already empty.   The menu seems promising. The drinks are reasonably priced.  Upon ordering, I wasn't asked how I want my burger cooked. Which usually doesn't matter except that mine came well over cooked... When it eventually came.   After waiting 20 minutes for our food, already starving, we asked about it to the hostess. She said she's check and proceeded to head back to her station. Meanwhile, one of our girls noticed a tray of food just sitting on the other side of the bar and a couple of waiters asking each other who's food it was sitting in the ope  Our food proceeded to sit until I eventually stood up and flagged the servers over to our table.   Our food was cold, we had to remind our server that we wanted a water refill, and we were fairly ignored. Truly terrible."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was underwelming. They need  to get rid of the word gourmet. Had 2 stars but now that I am sick have to go with the minimum of 1 if there was an option for none I would rate it a zero. We will never be back. Avoid the micro burger (only ate 1/4 of it because it was so discusting)."}
{"text":"Pretty place friendly staff just slow service but better then the long line for Breakfest at  The South Point,"}
{"text":"fresh food. reasonable prices.  good service. had a healthy wrap meal.  egg white omelette with mushrooms and cheese...fresh fruit on the side.  also had the smoked salmon.  nice atmosphere.  go here if you're staying here.  be sure to tip the waiter."}
{"text":"I can't review the food, but I was sad with the customer service.  The host informed us we had less than 5 minutes to order happy hour, so I went into the bar knowing exactly what I wanted to order.  I sat at 5:57 with 3 minutes left.  Multiple bartenders looked at me, yet none took a moment to greet me. It was 6:02 when I was greeted, so I requested happy hour where the bartender looked at his watch and said that it is only available until 6. I left right then."}
{"text":"There are plenty of stand alone burger joints that do a fine job: Inn N Out, Five Guys, Tommy's etc. But Sandy and I were pleasantly surprised by Burgers & Brews at the M hotel and casino. They make 10 and 12 ounce burgers that are delicious with all the fixings you can ask for. I especially like their fries. My two favorites are the salt and pepper or the sweet potato fries with sweet sauce. Reasonably priced and they have a happy hour with half price appetizers and draft beers."}
{"text":"Great service, better food with a great view. Who could ask for anything more when your out for a birthday dinner. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my husband and I were not very impressed with this place. Our table was great and we were sat in front of the large window with a pretty view of the pool and the strip.  Our food was the issue here. First off the only beers they had were in bottles which is a bit ridiculous for a hotel restaurant. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower which was soggy cauliflower with buffalo sauce on it. My husband wanted the Tater Tots which again were soggy but with cheese on them. For our entree we split the crab cake burger...maybe we should have just gotten a regular burger, but the crab cakes were super salty and really just not tasty. We live so close to the M, but we will definitely not be returning to this burger joint."}
{"text":"Great place located in M Casino Las Vegas.   Interesting selection of burgers all very tasty. Wild mushroom with Carmelized. Onion my selection also open for breakfast. Casual modern atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Get a couple of different fries and share them.  Staff is well trained in service."}
{"text":"Great great atmosphere and superior service. A little higher on the price, but, man do you get what you pay for.  Cpnt Dan likes... Captain Dan's home in San Francisco"}
{"text":"Today I'm having the healthy wrap wife's having the parfait the food and service is always great here this is definitely one of the best places for breakfast."}
{"text":"Really high on the list of worst places I've ever eaten. Ambiance is amazing. They should just raise the prices and quality a bit to fit the environment. I had a veggie burger and its usually hard to go wrong with that. It was so flat and tasteless and soggy. I even had to send my Cosmo back cuz it had a weird perfume taste in it. My partner got sick from the coconut shrimp before we could even leave the table. Our stay here just started. Hope we have better luck with the food over the next 4 days!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian but the room service at the  M resort said they offer all burgers veggie patty as well- I  Ordered a IPA burger, made it veggie which I appreciate a burger place will do, and it was delicious!! Ordered a side of buffalo cauliflower, very good!! I've had a lot of these from LA restaurants and these buffalo cauliflower are in top 3!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FOOD.   My husband and I went last night on a date..  We have been here for breakfast and NEVER had an issue.  The burgers were REALLY  good  the buns especially .. The bun in my opinion is what makes the burger.  Usually I don't finish  bun , but pick.. Not this time.  I had the Micro BGR. Veggie style  Hubby had the IPA BGR.   BOTH of us LOVED this place.  VERY quiet  . Low key  , DIDN'T feel like we were in a casino at ALL.  WILL DEFINITELY BY BACK.."}
{"text":"Do NOT have the steak.  Although it is basically attached to Anthony's steak house,  do not make the mistake of thinking you will gwt tje same cut of steak.  The burgers were good, the sliders were great, the grilled salmon was good, but over cooked. The stwak was absolutely awful. Honestly i thought i was at Sizzler, or Denny's.  A tough, thin steak witj little taste.  I told the waitress it was awful and they should actually take it off the menu.  She said she would talk to the chef.  No idea what that meant.  She never brought it up again, and never apologized. Bad food and untrained staff is not a combination for longevity.  Tj2at probably explains why there weren't very many people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow the burgers are great! We got the porter and lager burgers medium rare and sweet potato fries. The burgers were huge and cooked perfectly. I like both but will definitely come back for the porter burger. It was definitely one of the best I had. The sweet potato fries are amazing with that maple sauce. The service was great. I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating here and this trip was excellent! First  off, our server was Jackie, and she was AMAZING!! She was kind, attentive, brought out another drink without even having to ask, and also split my cobb salad without me having to ask!! Servers rarely do this and she was attentive enough to do this courtesy without me even having to ask. Cobb salad was delicious and the burger cooked medium was perfect. The garlic Parmesan fries are excellent! This is a must have! I will definitely be back and only want to sit in Jackie's section. Thank you for the excellent service and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Dad got the Brooklyn Seasonal Lager, mom, a Red Sangria & I had my usual, Educated Guess.  Kristoff is always quick & friendly.  The best!  Always smiling too.  The hostess & bar backs are also.    Two of my absolute must haves on the menu & during HH!  Half off apps, Buffalo Cauliflower.  The best app!   Porter Burger.  Best juicy hefty burger on the list!  All of their burgers are hefty.  Huge & I spilt it in three ways w/ my folks.  An app & one burger fills the three of us up honestly!  Plus cocktails & you have three happy people.    Thanks Kristoff & chefs!"}
{"text":"Wow! The flavors are exactly what I wanted. We saw this place when we visited the Hash a Go Go and had to check it out. This place is classy and beautiful! Our waiter was on it and recommended great things! We actually had everything from alcohol, beer, appetizers, burgers, fries, and dessert! It was ALL Delish!!!!  I tried the lager shandy it was yummy! My hubby enjoyed his beers in the cool chilled  table side glasses. We had coconut Shrimp which was perfectly breaded and served with mango pico de gallo. I was surprised on the amount of shrimp and the sizes. The burgers were perfect size too. We both ordered the Stout burger with the bacon.  We shared the sweet potato fries with maple sauce...tasted like a yummier version of a maple bar. For dessert we had the cake pops and ice cream. We had such a great experience. If the M wasn't so expensive to stay we would totally be here more. This is going to be a regular dinner visit for us when we visit Vegas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a good burger place nestled in M resort, off the strip, which is a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the strip. A group of us came on a Monday night, so no crowds. The servers were all very friendly and accommodating for our large group of 8.   Each of the burgers on the menu is conveniently named after the recommended beer pairing. I believe each burger was in the range of $10-15 for a 10oz. patty. Pretty good deal. The burgers come with the lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickle on the side for you to put in as you like.  Considering majority of the group was male, most of the orders were for the Imperial burger that is stacked high with stout braised short rib. I had a taste of the Imperial and it was cooked well, but the selling point was the short rib and no one was blown away by it. The short rib was shredded but had no other real flavor of its own so it was just meat on top of meat. Not a bad burger, but a little disappointed by it.  I wanted to get something different so we could try more on the menu. I ordered the IPA to stand out from the group. I liked my burger a lot more. It had grilled chilies, pepper jack cheese, and fried jalapenos on a bbq spiced patty. I like my food with a little kick and this burger had flavor and a kick. Cooked well and seasoned nicely.   We also ordered 3 types of fries to go around: truffle, garlic and Parmesan, and the bacon and cheddar. The favorite of the table seemed to be the garlic and Parmesan. The fries are nice and thick cut but still crispy. However they seemed to have a heavy hand with the truffle oil, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the truffle flavor was a little overwhelming considering it also came with a truffle dipping sauce. The bacon and cheddar ones tasted just like a baked potato.   Overall, we had a nice dining experience and the burgers are a real deal for the price. I wouldn't mind coming back for another burger and brew."}
{"text":"Can't say I will be back. My order was wrong, not what I ordered, but I decided to eat anyway because the food took so long to come out. No refill service for our drinks and the final bill was not correct.   The star rating was only this high because the quality of the food was excellent. If they square away their servers and add more kitchen staff it would be an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad. But also not the best burger I've ever had.  For Vegas, they have good prices and service was good."}
{"text":"We came in looking for a great burger and we weren't disappointed! We ordered both The lager and stout burgers. Both had great flavor. The seasoning and beer combination in the stout just made it stand out. The fries are traditional with various options, but tasty just the same. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, excellent service, friendly staff...! Nice atmosphere. You can sit inside or outside and if the weather is nice, I suggest sitting outside. Great view overlooking the pool."}
{"text":"We came for the 1/2 off appetizers for happy hour. Everything is about $5 and the food is well worth the price! You get to choose the flavor of everything; wings, fries, potstickers. Plus they have a huge selection of beers! They don't have any alcohol on happy hour though. Our server Mattew provided great service and advice about the beer, I am looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries...although a little pricey.  $4 for iced tea?!?!  Had the Imperial Burger (topped with short ribs, caramelized onions, Gruyere cheese) and the bacon cheddar fries.  The bun became soggy very quickly and wasn't up to the task of supporting all of the burger toppings.  Fries were good, although the cheddar sauce was kinda bland.  Needed more bacon too.    Service was good..."}
{"text":"Soooo GOOD......  staying at the M after a long day at Bare pool w friends called in a Lagar burger and sweet potato fries to take up to our room... big enough to share with the hubby .... delicious med rare cooked perfectly...  sweet potatoes fries so yummy w that maple dipping sauce. Worth every bite ....."}
{"text":"Besides the service being a 6/10 and the annoying 60yr old lady dancing around our table and trying to conversate with us.... The burger was absolutely amazing.  I ordered the \"IPA\" burger with bacon and a fried egg added. It was sooo good. I also ordered the \"salt\" and \"pepper\" fries which were pretty good. Stay away from the apps, although good, its way too much food. Will be back again, soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner. It's happy hour from 4 pm to 6 pm. We saw the menu and decided what to order. We got sliders, garlic chicken wings, Parmesan garlic fries and potstickers. Everything was so good. I enjoyed the Parmesan garlic fries and the potstickers. The garlic chicken wings were tasty. We shared appetizers. All appetizers were half off. Good deal! We also had a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream. This was so rich and decadent. Have this dessert and you will thank me. This is the only dessert they serve. This is what the waiter told me. The waiter was good about checking up on us.   Service was excellent here. They have regular dining here and happy hour at the bar. Very cool.   I would definitely come back here. Appetizers are delicious and worth it if you can come between Monday to Friday from 4 pm to 6 pm."}
{"text":"The Imperial Burger and the IPA Burger was amazing.  Low price but great quality of food would recommend it to anyone.  We both loved the truffle fries."}
{"text":"Always a great place to grab a snack with great beers. The view of the pool and strip is really great to see from afar. The service is good and the food is always excellent. We usually share a butter and fries just because we don't need all that food but the ingredients and vegetables are fresh. Beer list is good too.  The bar by the deli has sculpin - in case there are any beer connoisseurs reading this."}
{"text":"We had a thanksgiving meal here on our way to Sedona.  They had a special menu - traditional thanksgiving dinner which is a roasted turkey with herb stuffing, and also had Imperial Burger - stout braised short ribs topped, mushrooms, gruyere cheese, caramelized onions.  Both items were a little too heavy for our taste buds, but the turkey was surprisingly moist and tender, especially the white meat. Even though we became full quickly, we took out the remains in a box so our dog can enjoy the unseasoned chunk of white meat.  I would say Anthony's is a fairly decent dining option in M Resort."}
{"text":"To kick off our Vegas weekend, my friend suggested we stop at this place for an amazing burger and brew (well, wine for me).  The dining area is both beautiful and comfortable with large windows for outdoor viewing.  I decided I would go with the stout burger, where I unfortunately had to omit the stout mustard (not a mustard fan). Ordered a Cab to drink before the meal arrived, which was pleasant in both aroma and taste.  Then, out came this beautifully stacked burger!  They give you a knife to cut the heaping burger in half, but this hungry woman was NOT shy.  I put that knife to the side and dove right in.  The beef was cooked to a perfect medium!  The flavors were savory and juice went dripping down my hand.    My friends and I also ordered the white cheddar bacon fries.  Can we say oralgasm in a paper cone?!  YES. Oh they were AMAZING.  I WILL be making a return trip to this place - especially because I didn't get the chance to try dessert!"}
{"text":"I love this place especially Ftidays for the Prime Rib special! Great cut and ever so tender. Great beer specials and plenty of tv's.  Our waiter Eric was very responsive and looked after us. Will ask for him again.   Now off to my favorite blackjack table."}
{"text":"Our waiter Tim was absolutely amazing. Just a total angel.   Tim, you and everyone at Anthony's filled our tummies with delicious margaritas and burgers and made our drive home sooooooo much more enjoyable. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was not. Waiters were totally absent or talking to other coworkers while I was waiting on cream for my coffee by the time it arrived my coffee was cold. I ordered peanut butter with my French toast, got the French toast but no peanut butter. For a pricey place I expected a little more service."}
{"text":"I have to say this review is mainly for the breakfast. I ate here all 4 days I was having breakfast during my stay at the M. I tried the steak and eggs (DELISH), Belgian Waffle with berries (for an additional $3, and also DELISH!) with a side of bacon (the bacon could have been thicker), the Veggie Benedict (also good but not my favorite, and the French Toast (paid $3 again for berries on top) and a side of sausage. I didn't care for the sausage and only ate one of the 3 links, and the French Toast was not cooked enough for me with gooey egg in the middle. I did get a martini here one night, and would say it should have been stronger, but was served in a beautiful glass. Waitstaff is attentive and kept refilling coffee and water, overall a great experience! Can't vouch for lunch or dinner though, never tried it."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from a burger bar in the lobby of an off strip casino  but this place is awesome! The menu is varied , burger choices are eclectic and tasty- appetizers are fantastic( garlic crispy wings are my fav)   Beer and drink choices are great - bar seating available as well as patio seating. Strip prices aren't an issue here- you don't feel like your getting a colonoscopy when ordering an entree;   I think fries or a side should be included with a burger- thus 4 stars.  Pictures are the ipa burger( jalape√±o , pepper jack cheese and BBQ sauce) and salt/ pepper fries  And the servers are \" slow\" when returning to your table- maybe my server\" Kirk\" had an off day ......."}
{"text":"The burger was well done plus. The fries a soggy disgusting mess. The food took forever too."}
{"text":"Not too bad if you're in the casino and need a burger. More like 2.5 stars.  Stopped in for a burger and salad with my girlfriend . Ended up costing $38... be wary the ice tea was $4 each."}
{"text":"I will say i had the best burger I've had in a long time. Stopped her for lunch on the way back to LA from Vegas and (instead of in and out) tried something new. I'm glad we did. The restaurant itself is in the MLife casino and hotel and is nice, clean and convenient. A great selection of beers and wines also"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in Henderson.  Ambiance: The restaurant is near the lobby of the hotel, next to Anthony's Steak House. You walk in to the hostess stand and the bar area. The bar area is small but nicely appointed with a few tables and a couple of couches. We usually eat in the dining area. It is spacious, with nicely spaced tables. There is a floor to ceiling wall of glass with a nice view of the pool area and the Strip in the distance. When the weather is accommodating, there are tables out on the deck with the same view - really nice. Service: service is consistently good. The servers have been consistently pleasant and attentive. Food: My wife and I always order the same dish - the imperial burger. It has stout braised short ribs topped with mushrooms, gruyere cheese, caramelized onions. A huge burger that we share for $12.99.  We also get a side of sweet potato fries that comes with a side of a dipping sauce that is incredible. I generally stop at the video poker for a few minutes before going in to eat, so I bring in what is left of my Asylum beer - not a problem for the restaurant. Value: Dinner for 2 for under $20 before tax and tip. And it's delicious! Such a deal!!"}
{"text":"The burgers were very good here. I had the IPA burger and I paired it with an IPA - nice! The garlic parmesan fries were great. I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full. The service was good as well, with our waters being refilled often. The atmosphere is really nice, with a view outside, something you don't get in most casino restaurants. Wish I could've tried more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"We are here currently eating burgers and sweet potatoes fries.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food and it was cold.  The fries were so cold they were hard.  The burgers were over cooked and cold.  It took another 25 minutes for a waitress to come back and even check on us.  Our drinks were never refilled.  The food and service is horrible."}
{"text":"My beau and I came here after work one day, just by happenstance -- and I'm glad we did! We sat at the bar to gain access to the half-priced appetizers during Happy Hour, which made for an informal dining experience. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.   The ambiance is relaxed and casual, probably thanks to the restaurant being open to the casino on one side and the main lobby on the other. We heard the slot machines dinging and chiming occasionally, but it wasn't bothersome. The back of the restaurant is nothing but floor-to-ceiling windows, which provide an awesome view of Sin City.   We ordered a few things to share...   Crispy chicken wings with buffalo sauce / I really enjoyed these! True to their name, they were crispy, crunchy, and tasty. As someone who loathes a blubbery wing, these were much appreciated. The sauce was very light, so I ordered some extra on the side to dunk. I'm a saucy broad, no shame!   Stout burger / yum! We asked to split the 10 oz burger, and were tickled pink when they brought it to us on two separate plates. Anyone else notice that restaurants rarely take the time to do this anymore? I thought it was a nice touch -- AND we each got our own pickle! Score! Loved the crispy bacon and thick grained mustard on top.   Garlic Parmesan fries / omgggg. All the heart-eye emojis to this dish. Every bite was better than the last!   The two of us ate for $25, before tip.   Service at the bar was excellent. Cesar took very good care of us, even though we didn't have a drop of alcohol to drink.   Next time I'm by the M, I'd love to stop by again."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a bite in the afternoon or breakfast.  The service was great.  The food was also terrific. I recommend the juevos rancheros if you have breakfast.  The eggs benedict was also very good according to my son.  Prices reasonable.  Outdoor seating is just awesome."}
{"text":"Great spinach and artichoke dip!! Burgers were ok... we didn't drink but the list was of a great selection. Service was good and host was very thoughtful- even when seating us was observant of the sun coming in the restaurants windows asking us if it would be ok ."}
{"text":"The burger was supposed to be medium rare. It was overlooked and dry. The fries were soggy, soft, and greasy. If the server had come back and asked how our food was, I would have told him, but he didn't until we were done. He never asked how the food was. Perhaps we came on a bad night, but I expect more from a 13 dollar burger. Meh."}
{"text":"This place has great views. Easy to get in and out of  the resort...free parking!!! The food is surprisingly good. Wish they had a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, but that's a minor qualm."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars..why you ask..simply this. I know a good burger when I eat one and this was not it. No doubt was it a solid effort on trying something new with incorporating beer with cooking the burgers but it just wasn't there. The flavors just weren't there. Also My burger just fell apart at the end. If they would try using a brioche bun instead it will also help keep the burger stable when compiling all those topping we love so much. There are so many great places In las vegas to get a burger and this is not one of them. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"OMG!   They still can't get an order right!   Servers are dull and un-attentive!  Food is not consistent! last 2 times fries were ok but not hot enough for me. (temp)   Beer is great if you can get a server!"}
{"text":"The Skinny:  poor control of seasoning mar what ought to have been a decent burger (2), service is okay but the ambience sucked because it is open air next to a bunch of slot machines - the continuous noxious wave of smoke hovered over us as we tried to eat (2) value: given all the great burger joints in the valley, this one deserves a skip (2)  We came here after work one night to check out this place out.    My hubby was the eyeing the truffle fries, fried zucchini sticks and the Imperial Burger. I was just looking for a good Caesar's salad.   The ambience is severely lacking. The fact that the restaurant is not cordoned off from the main casino floor makes for a smoky, unpleasant experience. If you don't like smoke, I would suggest you attempt to be seated as far away from the slot machines as possible.  Service was okay - our server brought out our meals in a reasonable time and kept our water glasses filled most of the time.  The food was just not that good considering the amount we paid for it. I just wasn't impressed by anything we ordered. Some of the ideas were good however the poor execution really prevented any food from being even halfway good.  The coating of the fried zucchini sticks was overly thick and seemed to slough off the zucchini too easily. As well, the zucchini itself was very salty. The Truffle fries although ample truffle flavoring lacked the proper texture - not enough crispiness to it. The Imperial burger had nothing imperial about it. Bland braised tough short rib and flavorless caramelized onions graced the under seasoned beef patty. The Caesar salad was pretty generic and I wouldn't get it again.  Overall, there really isn't a compelling reason to recommend or return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been to Anthony's a few times and have not had a bad meal yet.  The burger sizes are great and there is good value for the money.  As others have noted, the menu is entirely a la carte so fries and sides are extra.  The fries are also worth the money and come in a few varieties including sweet potato.  On my most recent trip I ordered the Red Ale burger - beef patty with bacon, fried egg, o'brien potatoes, and mornay sauce.  It was delicious.  Others have said it was overkill, but I think that was kind of the point.  It had great flavor and it was decadent.  My dining companions had the Lager Burger (with onions, mushrooms, and cheese) and the Pilsner Burger (cheese and pilsner sauce).  Both got high marks as well.  One of my dining companions also noted that the garlic parmesan fries were the among the best fries he's ever had - a glowing review to be sure.  Perhaps the best part of Anthony's is the beer selection.  Several craft bottles are available for $5.  Considering some strip casinos charge more for cans of bud light, this is a great value.  The only thing that would improve the beer selection is if Anthony's could tap into the draft selection at 32 Degrees across the casino floor.  M Resort is not too far from my house and I'm there frequently.  Anthony's Gourmet Burgers & Brews is one of my favorite places to go when I want a great burger for a decent price.  One side note - what's with the chairs?  They're a little low to the table and the angle of recline is a little relaxed.  It's an odd sitting position."}
{"text":"It's a shame we were turned away as this is a 21+ restaurant and my 12 year old is with us. Give me a break! How can families stay at your resort but only be able to eat at the deli? Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends - no preconceived notions about this place and I was pleasantly surprised. In the M resort, and not really closed off from the casino, so it was loud, but not overly. Made you feel like you were in the mix of things. The hostess took a while to come seat us, but after we were seated our waiter was great. Had the \"totchos\" as the appetizer. They were delicious. Crispy, cheesy, and lots of \"fixins\". After finally choosing what delicious burger to get, I settled on the red ale \"Cuban\" burger. Holy moly, it was delicious. The mustard was just perfect, and really brought it home. My friends got the hefeweizen burger and the lump crab cake sandwich. All delicious. They really know their sauces here, all were delicious and really set the burgers apart. I will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"My standards are high so my review might not be for general advice.   Higher quality then most fast food including five guys, in n out, smash, etc...but, just barely. I would not consider this gourmet.  I asked for medium. It wasn't.  I asked for ranch. Never got it.   Burger bun is too much. Could barely fit my mouth around it and it fell apart while eating.   Ingredients were less then fresh.    Ok, I only have been here once but one less than par experience and I really have no reason to go back.   I'm a former chef so again, my standards are high but for the price, I would not return here. 25 per person means not a single one of these mistakes should occur.   If I was chef here, I would be cracking the whip.  The place was busy to capacity and everyone seemed to be enjoying so I'm guessing they are making their quotas but if it were me, I would be pushing for higher quality to keep standards at par. Start slacking like what I noticed today and it won't last but maybe another few months before it closes and something replaces it."}
{"text":"Another really god place in M casino.  Large burger selection with 3 different fry choices.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Really good burgers at a reasonable price!  We all had burgers and each and everyone was super!  Also the garlic parm fries are not to be missed!  I'm a fan of good brewed ice tea and that too was great!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice, low key place that had a bar that was perfect to kick back and eat some good food. If you're looking for somewhere to relax while you eat, this is a great spot! Not great if you want something touristy or with a ton of people waiting to get in the door..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was not a excellent experience! the place has a nice ambient. Honestly the best restaurant is gonna have a unsatisfactory performance occasionally     Let me begin by pointing out that the bar is elegant yet it's missing slot machines! this prompted my friend and I to wait for our take out order outside in the casino area.       My friend was using his casino food comps to get the order. $35 covers 2 burgers and 2 drinks. We asked our bartender what his favorite burger was. His response was the Porter burger which has additional pastrami topping!        Our bartender said \"come back in 15 minutes and your food will be ready! \" I was excited. The place was not busy. Well I returned 25 minutes later and it was very busy! And our order was not ready! Needless to say others that had arrived after us were eating. I must say nothing makes an experience more negative than seeing other patrons that arrived after you enjoying they're bounty!        I returned in 15 minutes! And our order still wasn't ready. We stood in the middle of the restaurant waiting for an additional 5 minutes.         Well the order arrived. I'm sorry. It was a delicious meal. But the service was not."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, but I truly had a wonderful experience at this place. Service was exceptional and my dinner was delicious!  I had the Angus, grilled onion and Brie sliders... so tender. I also ordered the sweet potato fries with a maple mayo...BEST cooked fries ever and the maple mayo was so good. Finished with their Bread pudding...perfectly sweet. It was so good that I may go back tomorrow night."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and awesome food. We got the peach sangria and a simple rum and coke to start along with ahi tuna for an app and it was amazing. Our server was genevine and she was so nice and personable and we loved her. Especially for putting up with my drunk ass. We also had cole and Travis help us out and they were amazing!!! Soooo friendly and nice. We ordered the stout burger lager burger along with parm and garlic fries which were fantastic. This place was awesome and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The food is out of this world. Nick is the best waiter. Get the garlic fries.....you womt be disappointed"}
{"text":"The M really has a good selection of great restaurants, and Anthony's is no exception.  Finally came by when we were hungry and this place was open - we've been trying for a few trips now.  Hung over a bit, the wife and I shared a bacon cheeseburger and pot stickers.  Both were good, and I'd like to go back and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have ever had. Sat down n waited 15min to even get water... Another 10 for a drink.... Ordered n got ranch side after we were done... Smh.... NEVER COME HERE! Food was just OK... Service SUCKED"}
{"text":"It's crazy.  I went here a couple months ago, and it's one of those places that for some unknown reason, keeps popping up in my head.  Specifically the place. I remember where I sat, I remember details like the two guys I sat next to (they ordered wayyy too much fries), I remember the view overlooking the blue skies.  I remember how the hostess was an asian girl with humonguous boobs.  I remember the calla lillies by the hotel check in.   I remember the food was generous and good.  I especially remember the parmesan fries.  It was big.  Thank goodness the two of us shared that.  The chicken salad had oranges and some peanut vinaigrette.  It's an interpretation of thai flavors, but lacking in boldness.    And on to the burgers, I got the Micro Burger with micro greens (looked like arugula to me) and goat cheese.  Hubby got the burger with mushroom and swiss cheese, the Lager burger.  They were good.  But I came to a realization.  I like my burger classic: I want to taste ketchup, pickles and the texture of lettuce.  I love goat cheese, but I'd rather eat that with a lamb burger.    But it was a burger well done.   And I was happy when I left."}
{"text":"Fairly decent casino bar/restaurant. The appetizers and burgers were decent and, like the rest of the casino, there's usually lots of space to spread out because it's rarely crowded. Service is very friendly too.  Depending on the time of day, there aren't that many other options here at the M, so if you're here for a late lunch or if you've woken up far too late after a debaucherous night and don't feel like venturing out, this may be your only choice."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burger joint. The only burger I will ever eat.   My boyfriend and I discovered Anthony's this past Valentine's Day and ever since then we have been addicted.  *Sidenote* Our Valentines Day dinner was spectacular. 3 course dinner; shrimp cocktail, prime rib, and a heavenly dessert plate. We also got their bacon cheddar fries, garlic Parmesan fries (trying not to salivate all over the keyboard right now) and one of their specialty burgers too boot. Yes, I know, my boyfriend and I are binge eaters.lol  We come here about once a month because we both crave their burgers and fries. We always order their fish tacos for an app, then our own burgers and the two fries and then dessert. For the price you would pay for a burger at a typical neighborhood restaurant (*cough cough* Red Robin) you would get the same from Anthony's but the burgers are gourmet, more flavorful and the ambiance is defiantly more chic then a neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and incompetent staff. Food is burgers and fries. Not sure how you can mess that up but Anthony's did. I asked for medium rare burger and got a grey meat slab. They claim to be a brew place but only have bottles. Quit faking the funk and get some beers on draft. Fries were way to greasy. Staff rolled in on the short bus with the manager driving. Went there  with another couple and wanted to split the bill at the end of our meal. Took about 30 minutes for them to split a bill of $90.00. When they did split the bill it came out to $60 on one card and $30 on the other. Save your time and money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This was a great experience all around and we keep talking about going back! The ambiance is nice as its a quaint little area in the M with a nice view of the pool area.  The hostess was great as she sat us and asked if we were comfortable at that table (there was a breeze from the air vent) and easily moved us.  The waiter was fantastic, giving us recommendations, keeping our drinks full and checking on us appropriately.   The food was great! Didn't get any appetizers, though some looked good, due to the size of the burgers we saw around us.  I got the IPA burger and he got the Imperial burger.  All the burgers there have a component named for a beer and you can tell the depth of flavor.  The IPA burger was great, cooked how I had asked with the right balance of chili's and bbq flavor.  He really liked the Imperial burger as it was full of meat with short ribs and mushrooms on top of the burger! The buns were great quality and all together just what I wanted from a burger.  We shared the garlic parmesean fries and they were a great addition with great flavor.   We got the red velvet cake which was obviously good as I didn't even get a bite, and the peanut butter pie which was fantastic! Best dessert I have had in a long time and I couldn't even finish it! Peanut butter mousse on top of a oreo like cookie with fudge, then covered in caramel and peanut butter cups on top! Bliss on a plate!  The convenience of the M along with the great service and food will definitely make this a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 2pm.  Waited around for them to open at 4pm.  Sat by the window overlooking the pool, very nice view with natural light.  Started with the Cobb Salad.  My wife and I split it and they were nice enough to put it into two bowls for us.  It was an excellent salad, tasty and well prepared, no big pieces of lettuce or funky old bits of anything.  For the main course I had the Imperial burger and my wife had the Pilsner burger. We shared the cheddar and bacon fries.  My wifes burger was medium rare, she ordered it medium well.  I ordered mine medium and it came out well done like meat loaf which really hurt the flavor of it.  My wife's burger was pretty tasty.  Mine was just ruined by being over cooked and the advertised short rib on top of the patty was so minuscule that I barely noticed it.  The fries were just bad.  The first fry I tried was cold, the second one was really hot, kind of wierd.  The bacon was fine but the cheddar was not melted shredded cheddar instead it was a pasty gravy that was more wondra than cheese and was broken and grainy, really nasty.  The beer and liquor selection is good and the prices are fair.  I had a couple of beers.  It seems like all the beers are bottled but that's OK.  The service was very good.  I can see how this place could really be great if everything came together for one diner, but if a place can't be consistent I'm not willing to give them my business.     Another thing of note: No minors allowed."}
{"text":"Let your tongue read the following: Irish Stout Burger - Irish cheddar, smoked bacon, stone ground stout mustard. It was by far the best hamburger I've ever had in my life.  Add in the black truffle fries and a nice cold beer. Stop it... I can't take it anymore. If you are anywhere near the M Resort you HAVE to try this place. I promise you it's life-changing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 5 years as the M Resort is our favorite hotel. Burgers & Brews has great breakfast and lunch. The garlic Parmesan fries are to die for!! Love it here."}
{"text":"Located right as you walk into the M Casino from the parking lot, Burgers & Brews is a casual restaurant/lounge with prices on the higher side. Our group was promptly started off with drinks and I was happy to see that they offered Not Your Father's Root Beer (alcoholic) in bottles. A few people in the group ordered Mojitos and really enjoyed them. Service was pretty attentive, and she was quick to offer us refills as we ran out.  A few people ordered appetizers which were just okay, so I recommend sticking with the burgers. Fries are $6 extra but are a huge portion, so be sure to share these instead of ordering them per person. I went with the Lager Burger with braised mushrooms in lager, caramelized onions, and melty provolone. It was cooked to a nice medium, and it was really filling. I enjoyed it. If you're craving a burger or want something casual but high-quality, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this place a few times and they have amazing sweet potato fries with maple fry sauce but I ate there last night with my Fiance and I ordered the Imperial Burger and it literally was the most horrific smelling burger that I have ever ordered. I could not eat it due to the smell. Was bummed out because the first time I ate there was awesome. I will try some other things but do not recommend the Imperial Burger at all."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving dinner at Anthony's in the M Resort. We wanted to go to The Studio B Buffet inside of the M Resort but that line was over two and a half hours long so we decided to go to Anthony's. I ordered their Thanksgiving dinner which consisted of slices of turkey, mash potatoes, dressing, fresh green beans, cranberry sauce, and a slice of spiced pumpkin (17.95). The price was great. After adding salt to my food it was pretty good. I did not care for their dressing. I also ordered garlic parmesan fries and they were fabulous. The garlic parmesan fries gets a 5 star. My daughter ordered garlic chicken wings and they gave her about 10 wings which was good. My husband ordered a barbeque cheeseburger and it was really good. The ground beef was fresh and thick; not a frozen thin patty. I give their burger a 5. Overall the Thanksgiving meal including the price got a 3 1/2 star from me. I will definitely go back for their other food."}
{"text":"We came here on our way out of Vegas and the food was not my favorite.  The salads were way over dressed and salty (would you like some lettuce with your pool of dressing?). The Parmesan fries are drowning in what I think is Mayo so they are greasy and soggy.  The only thing we enjoyed were the fried mac and cheese bites.  Maybe the burgers are better, but definitely don't get the salads!"}
{"text":"A great place located in the M casino. The food was good, nothing crazy delicious but really good. I got a burger and the meat was cooked perfectly for what I ordered! The place wasn't too busy, so it was a quick in and out and the service was good as well. Overall, the ambiance was nice but wouldn't be my first place to go to dinner. Defiantly going to try it again though!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great fish and chips!! It was my birthday and the waiter brought this amazing chocolate explosion! It's like a molten chocolate cake inside a very this light pastry. Soooo good!! My friends had burgers that were outstanding! Great service."}
{"text":"Pr√™t teh, pr√™t teh, pr√™t teh good burger!  Cruised in early evening for a beer and a burger - I had the Micro burger which is avocado, new belgium fat tire tomato, goat cheese, mixed greens and lemon pepper. I exchanged the mixed greens for onion and added some sliced jalape√±o...oh yummy!!!  That burger was like lead and with a couple of Arrogant Bastard ales I just about needed a cot!   Atmosphere was pretty cool - the bar chairs don't seem like they would be comfortable but they actually are - very comfortable.  The only complaint I would have is they don't have anything on tap - kinda strange for a place with brews in their name."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not worth the $$$!!!  $14 for bacon and eggs?  What is this the four seasons?  The oatmeal was runny and nothing I would come back for.   The special was chorizo burrito with Swiss cheese??? And no beans??  The chef must be from Idaho!  Mexican breakfast should be served with beans not potatoes!  And jack cheese!!!  This place is not for me! Anthony's is Overpriced & ordinary!"}
{"text":"This is the only breakfast option at the M, besides the coffee/bakery. The dining area is attractive, open, with nice views. I ordered the corned beef hash and boy was it tasty. It's freshly made in the kitchen, not something from a can. It was served with 3 perfectly cooked eggs, potatoes, and toast of choice. My vegetarian husband ordered the Belgian waffle with seasonal fruit. The fruit was fresh, not that canned or frozen stuff. All in all a well prepared and served meal, but for 40 bucks, it should be!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer. Burgers and brews is pretty new, opening about three weeks ago, and is already top notch. Located in the M casino, which is beautiful, clean, and a relaxing environment (for a casino lol), burgers and brews serves up some amazing food.   We had the Imperial Burger and Red Ale Burger (aka IPA burger) and both were awesome. Also got the Parmesan garlic fries and onions rings, both good but the garlic fries were a must. Beer selection is good, the only down side is its all bottles, personally I'm a draft guy. But that aside, I definitely say check this place out. Oh, and don't eat with your eyes because serving size is pretty dang big. I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"Being lighter eaters we decided to try this place out in lieu of our usual spots. Ordered the imperial burger to be split and regular fries with beers of course. Delightful choice. Great flavors and cooked perfect as were the fries. Filled us up and put a smile on are faces. Service was first rate."}
{"text":"Burgers are nothing special! Fries are super soggy! Not worth the hype!! Service was great"}
{"text":"Came to the M Hotel to check out the place for the first time last night. After an hour of fun with video poker, we became famished and decided to have burgers and beers. The restaurant sits in an open space close to the lobby hotel registration. I thought that was kind of neat especially for someone who likes to people watch like me. Although it was a Friday night, the place wasn't packed and there was no wait.  Our server was cordial but nothing more. After ordering, the food took about a half hour to arrive. That felt like forever because we were famished. What we ordered: I.P.A burger, lager burger and cheddar bacon fries. Also, a Hoegaarden beer.  The beer was fine. (It's a Hoegaarden after all). The burgers were just bland. Both of them. They even tasted almost identical aside from the fact that mine had a touch of BBQ sauce and a couple of fried peppers. Both patties were under seasoned. The lager burger was supposed to have \"braised mushrooms in lager, caramelized onions\". We didn't taste the lager at all and only a subtle taste of the onions. Yeah, ketchup went on our burgers. We didn't want to but it had to happen. The fries were good, but nothing spectacular. The cheddar tasted like cheese wiz to me.  We were eyeing the bread pudding at the start of the meal but all things considered, decided to not pay Anthony any more money. Service and food: no bueno, so we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant located next to the oyster bar near the hotel lobby and front desk.  The name describes this place well. I eat at all he restaurants here and this one is super. The restaurant is pretty quiet even though out on the open. The menu is limited to about 5 salads, 8 or so burgers, appetizers and couple of sides. Items are al a carte and high price if you look at it as just a burger. It's surely more than than that. Good drink menu, coke products and a full bar do so you can get about anything. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Sit by the window and there's a great view. Even some lounge type couches to sit at and eat. Really good experience at this spit. Worthy of dropping some bucks here."}
{"text":"Yummy is the only way to describe this place.  Mac n cheese bites are out of this world !  The Pilsner burger was cooked perfectly and was enormous.  Great value and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enjoy this place overall.  Have eaten here about 5 times.  Apps are good, Burgers are great, service is excellent.  Wife and I split a burger, tasted excellent, Bacon Cheese Fries were awesome, drinks were great."}
{"text":"On 4/20/12, me and my girlfriend decided to plan a fun evening out, including dinner, happy hour and dancing. Having been frequent patrons of the M/resort we decided to give Anthony's Burgers and Brews a try for the first time. From Top to Bottom that was the worst experience, service wise we have experienced. We walked up to the empty podium for starters, after 3 minutes a young lady walks up, doesn't apologize, and I ask if there is seating available outside, she says its open seating out there and we say okay and start making our way over to the patio and she yells and say you'll need some menus, and hands them too us and we walk ourselves out to the patio. We then sit for approximately 15 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge our existence. So I physically have to get up and flag someone down and ask to be waited on. 5 minutes after that, a Casino Floor Cocktail waitress, not a server, came to take or order. She was nice but clearly didn't know the menu and seem to struggle with remembering what we ordered. We sit there for another 10 minutes and we don't get our drinks, water or appetizers. So I get up again and grab the manager and let her know we are having a problem, she apologizes and acts like she is going to take care of the issue. 5 minute later a runner brings out our drinks so we get our first drinks after 40 minutes!!!!! As we sit there and start to drink we watch the hostess seat a table near us and it just flat out makes you feel like we were not good enough to seat or serve, enough was enough and we got up and left, telling the manager on the way out that that was terrible and we will not be back. So we lost an hour there and had to skip our happy hour and we went to Republic Kitchen and Bar and had excellent service and food. Its really unfortunate, we planned on spending the day at M pool but really don't want to relive that experience so we have opted to change that plan as well. You guys can do way better!  Completely Dissatisfied"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I really love their food and excellent service. My sister's house is so close by so we stopped by to give a try. We loved their breakfast omelet and cranberry French toast and fresh fruits. Everything was so fresh and high quality.   My sister and I came two consecutive days for breakfast and we enjoyed so much!! We are so excited to find a gem place around our place! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"First things first.  This establishment doesn't have a children's menu yet.  For some reason the food was bland on this visit.  The I.P.A. Burger didn't have a taste of any IPA and the peppers were just soggy.  We sent back the Garlic fries.  They were undercooked, lifeless, greasy and soggy.  The sweet potato fries were good.  The service was only so so.  Will have to think hard before I return to this establishment.  Based on this visit, there are much better restaurants."}
{"text":"Ok burgers, not great. Live in Vegas, plenty of better options but also worse. My wife and I would eat here again, but we wouldn't go out of our way to do so."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the view....... all amazing. I've come to expect nothing less than excellent from my experiences at the M, but I am always even more impressed with Burgers N Brew."}
{"text":"These huge (10oz.) burgers are really good. I've tried 3 of them and can't say that one is better than the other.  The buns are perfect as they stand up to the burger with out being too dense. This is going to sound knit picky but, my only complaint is that they are so damn big. Literally, I couldn't get my mouth around the one with the fried jalapenos.  I would love to have a few ounces shave off of it. Don't get any sides. Burgers are $11-$13 which seems to be a fair price with the casino mark up."}
{"text":"I'm staying at this hotel for a conference and the first night was kind of late so I decided to just eat here. Burger was fantastic Fry's where amazing and the service was excellent. So the second night when my colleagues arrived they wanted to eat there and I was good with that so second night I had the pilsner Burger and the parmesan fries again excellent meal really good service. I don't agree with the previous reviews about bad service I thought the service was really spot on. Highly recommend this place for high quality food and service"}
{"text":"Was excited to finally try this place out ...  But it was very underwhelming and uninteresting. Service was questionable for many reasons. We had to get her attention to get anything. The best was when I asked for a lime for my beer and she asked me \"if I wanted the GREEN ones ?\". ( I didn't know they came in different colors )  We didn't like their chicken wings, nor the chicken sandwich and definitely NOT the garlic parmesan fries waitress recommended. Too funny - we actually wanted the onion rings which were more expensive and then she \"downgraded us\" to try the cheaper fries. Save your money"}
{"text":"Dang I wanted to love this place, and it is not bad.  It's good but not great.   The M was a surprisingly well appointed resort.  Very clean and not hectic at all.  The menu for Anthony's was promising.  And to be fair one just had the burgers one would be fine, however this one had more.  The Ahi appetizer was not good.  The coconut shrimp had a ill conceived pineapple salsa.    The beer selection is very good, the Burgers are very good the service is excellent.  Stick to the burgers and you will be fine.  Regrettably the fries were also disappointing."}
{"text":"Had a great meal over at the burger bar. The reason I'm giving this a four star instead of a five-star review is that I wish they had more booth options available. I also feel that for the price they could include fries or salad along with the burgers but those are an additional all a cart option. But if you don't mind sitting at a table style seat there are plenty of tables. I had the salmon which was excellent Kevin had a burger which was also excellent. Service was good and I do recommend."}
{"text":"This might possibly be one of the best burgers in Vegas! I am a regular at Anthony's burgers and brews inside the M resort and I have never been disappointed in any burger I have ever had! From the quality of beef to the exotic toppings this burger joint is a must try! The hours are a little unusual so be sure to check before you go. Their assortment of high end shakes are also a must have if you have room after the delicious burg. Be aware everything is large portion just the way I like it so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"I would come here often cause of their garlic parm fries. So my bf and I decided to come eat here. It's a Tuesday night and we came around 8ish. It was a little busy, but not as busy as usual. We sat down and waited to get our drinks ordered, nothing. 20-30 mins have passed since we sat down and we still haven't ordered our drinks or food. The thing that made me walk out was because we were waiting and we had no service, yet other people that just came in and sat down got service right away. So I won't be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"The Pilsner burger is just about the best burger I've ever had. Add a egg and bacon on it and you are set for a amazing experience.  Add in some salt and pepper fries on the side and a ice cold beer and it's a great experience."}
{"text":"Bacon fries and beer burgers!  We had the T.G.B turkey burger with roasted red peppers, Red ale burger with a fried egg and o'brien potatoes along with bacon white cheddar fries. All full of some good flavors, large portions and a wide selection of beers. The best part about our meal was our server James. He was attentive without being overbearing, gave great suggestions and was friendly."}
{"text":"Just came for a quick beer at the end of happy hour. A lot of action going on as there was a conference.  Our bar bartender, Cesar, was very accommodating. The food looks pretty good - but, we didn't have any eats."}
{"text":"Ok i have been here a few times and the food is good. But who the hell is ordering the \"brews\" the special beer for the day is ballast point sculpin and THEY ARE OUT OF IT....WTF. We were also here like 4-5 months ago and the beer menu is the same.......really its june and they have october fest beer still on the menu....But they are out of them ALL except a pear cider which should not be on the menu alyway. They should just have a runner to get beer from 32 degrees at least someone there is sure running the beer portion better. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in this place when it comes to beer. Please remove the \"brews\" name off the restaurant name until u actually have brews."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is beautiful! Their burgers are my favorite now. I had their short rib burger and it's to die for. It has so much flavor! It contains grilled mushrooms and onions, on a angus burger topped with shredded short rib. I also recommend trying their garlic Parmesan fries. This place is definitely something to call home about."}
{"text":"Service is aloof but the predictable yet acceptable burgers are not terrible - they are just not good. This sparse but nicely appointed bar and eatery suffers from a significant lack of foot traffic, so perhaps it is a question of on and off again customer service and inconsistent kitchen staffs. I am not certain why this remote resort, which is relatively attractive and clean can't get the restaurants right. I am puzzled - it appears that the resources are at their disposal to bring the \"A game\" to customers that drive 15 minutes or so off the Strip or nearby local neighborhoods, but we won't return any time soon. It is a shame because the resort is actually fairly attractive to locals, just not the food."}
{"text":"Burgers are around $10 and do not come with fries - the fries are another $5, but they are plenty to share and they have options like garlic parmesan and white cheddar and bacon.  The veggie burger was great - a good option for vegetarians.  The salads looked awesome, but cost as much as the burgers.  Beer prices were decent, especially for Vegas.  They have a few craft beers on draft, but not tons.  Most are in bottles."}
{"text":"Just south of the world famous Las Vegas Strip is a place known as The M Resort. My wife and I were here for what we thought would be a burger and fries lunch. But being at the time of 10:50 am, we were offered the breakfast menu.  I am not much of a breakfast person, but figured why not? Noticing the time, I did wonder why we were not offered the lunch menu's which would have gone into effect at 11:00 am. I also noticed that kids are not welcome after 11:00 am. To me that is a shame as my kids would have loved the view of the M Resort's swimming pool area. The same view, several miles away you will see the Las Vegas Strip.  The food was fine. Nothing to complain about. Didn't leave my stomach empty. But not too full either.  The entire place appears to be very nice. Service was fine, we were even advised to \"watch our step\" as we approached our table and did have a few steps to descend. But my largest concern is cleanliness. Our table was just inside the patio door leading to a view of the previously mentioned swimming pool area. Directly above this door and another table are quite a few dust bunnies.   Now imagine this, someone opens the patio door, and a gust of wind happens by. Those dust bunnies might just fall, onto a table, or even worse, onto someone's plate of food.   Anthony's Gourmet Burgers And Brews is a good place. Great food. But I was missing the \"WOW\" factor. I live in the northwest area of Las Vegas and this place is quite a drive for me to get to. Want me to return? I need a \"WOW\" factor to happen."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, but service was horrible. I think we waited at least 20 minutes for anyone to show up to help us. Then we had about 3 different servers try to help. Place was not busy at all. Then they got our drink order incorrect. They never did come back to check on us. Try the asian lager burger, very flavorful with pork belly. Yummy. The cheddar bacon fries are a must try. Crispy, gooey with just the right amount of bacon. Doubtful that I'd try it again, the service killed the experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was eggggcellent...actually I had the famous cranberry-orange almond French Toast, but it has eggs, right? The cran-orange-mond topping wasn't bad, but a little went a long way, so I reduced the spread to a minimum. Coffee was solid.  I also returned one evening for a beer. The bartenders were super friendly and recommended a good java stout for me. They definitely seem to know their regulars, and even chatted me up some as I jotted my weird little notes to self while sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday night during happy hour 4-6. They have half off apps but I did to order any. They have a amazing black berry mojito that you should definitely try. Ordered the cheese burger. Sweet potatoes fried and the Asian salad and split it all between the two of us. It was all cooked perfectly, tasted great. The only problem I have was out waitress. She wasn't very personable or nice. Take her out of the equation and you get 5 star."}
{"text":"Snacks. Tuna was over done and tasted old. Dry burger.  Not much else to say."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place gets nothing but five stars. Truly great burgers. The prices are reasonable for a high end burger place, and the beer pairings are spot on. I have been to Burger Bar, LBS, Grind, Public House, here in Vegas, and a lot of other burger joints across the country, and this is in my top 5 all time.  Nice view, and our service was great.  I am glad it is not closer, because I would be broke, and fat."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my regular places. However, my last visit concluded with the staff servicing the restaurant and themselves and not me and my guests. I was entertaining guests and we went in for drinks 10 minutes before 10pm (closing time). The bartender refused to serve us and advised us to waive down a server. The server served us and when my additional guests arrived to join us, the bartender refused to serve them as well and our server brought us the check with no acknowledgment of my guests. The Manager watched and did nothing. As an ambassador for the hospitality industry, I am embarrassed and disappointed. There are too many great places in this town to waste your time here."}
{"text":"Good burgers (~$10) with fries extra. Very good service and a decent beer selection. Overlooks (at a bit of a distance) the pool area with a view (a much larger distance) of the Strip. Some of the restaurants in the M also have happy hour specials so take a stroll around to see if there's anything else you'd like to try. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and we were highly disappointed. I had the lager burger and it had no flavor whatsoever and the French fries were soggy! Our server, Kirk, appeared to have no personality. He did return promptly with our drinks, but then took forever to return to take our order. Then, halfway through the meal, he returns and says, \"Here is your bill.\"  Halfway! Not almost done, but halfway! Kirk never asked if we needed anything else. He simply said \"Here's your bill\" stood it up on the table and kept walking. What if we wanted dessert? We found his approach odd. There were also 6 staff members all standing around talking from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. Obviously, it wasn't very busy (we were there around 2 pm). This was unprofessional in our opinion. Our whole experience was not good and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We would come here every day if you had wifi for customers. We love the view overlooking the pool, the food is good especially like you offer cottage cheese. Please add wifi so we can read the news with breakfast and answer e-mails."}
{"text":"The quality of food has been going down the past few visits we made here. I don't know if management changed or if they are now in the \"cut corner\" stage of their business, but it is definitely noticed. The service is still great, but the food no longer calls me back there....sorry, have to give this place the ax now."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. We were seated before two other couples and they ordered, got their food, and left before we received anything besides drinks and didn't see our server besides the time she dropped off our drinks. We waited well over 40 mins and received nothing. We deduced to leave and pay for our sodas. Server did not apologize even acknowledge the fact that she didn't check in with us. Very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"A fabulous burger is had here!!  We frequent Burgers and Brews quite often and have never been disappointed in any of our meals nor the service given by our favorite server Tim.  The meal is always hot, burgers always tasty, serving Is more then enough and Tim is always on point. He is insistent and ensures our dietary needs are meant, is always friendly and prompt to check in with us throughout our meal... regardless of how busy he is. Thanks Tim again for another fantastic meal."}
{"text":"This place sucked! We went cause hash house but they closed, this place was open so we'd try it, nah, never again I can't even wright a review"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, service was okay, however the smoke wafting in from the casinos at times was not okay. I thought that while they had no walls separating us from the casino they'd have a better ventilation system to blow the smoke away from us, gross!! Who even smokes nowadays?!?  We ordered chicken wings ( good), turkey burger (great), sweet potato fries with maple aioli (great) , side salad (good). Our friends got coconut shrimp (I think) and a regular burger, they said it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Simple menu, complex burger, amazing sides and just simply delicious."}
{"text":"The positives were our sever was very nice and attentive. The view of the city was also very pretty, very nice for a date.  The burgers had very little flavor, were dry and definitely overpriced. The food also took forever to come out.  Would not recommend. Many places offer better burgers for a lot cheaper.  You could eat at Jayde Fuzion or the buffet for around the same price and have a much better experience."}
{"text":"REVIEW #500! What better place to bestow such a landmark honor upon than Anthony's Burgers and Brews... it's definitely a Vegas-kissed joint!  After an excitement-filled day of sports gambling and tasty brews just around the corner, we got hungry and decided to come here after hearing so many neat things about it. This place used to be a hotel bar that served half-price appetizers at choice moments of the day, but now it's evolved into AGB&B. It's gorgeous and neat, just like pretty much the rest of the M.  We were promptly seated at the window facing the pool and received very attentive, if not slightly awkward, service from Tadd and his crew. We ordered a Lager Shandy and a Crabbie's Ginger Beer -- both outstanding drinks and perfect for a hot day :) We also opted for the Ahi Tuna appetizer. Here's my first recommendation: DON'T GET THE AHI TUNA APPETIZER. Bad call! It was decent, but way overpriced. It was neither done nor presented well enough, or even of a high enough quality, to cost what it did.  That being said, my bro ordered the Micro burger and I opted for the Imperial. We split a full order of truffle fries. Mistake #1! Too many fries for us (but then again, we did have some awesome leftovers to share at home later that night). Unlike some others who have shared on here, I think the short ribs complement the other ingredients well. Yes, they could stand to be seasoned better, but I like that they were rich in a different way from the angus patty. And holy moly that angus patty! Ten ounces must be French for \"wow this is frickin huge.\" That's what she said.  The nutty gruyere and the perfectly caramelized onions made my Imperial just so decadently tasty. I was also in love with my bro's burger -- micro greens, goat cheese, sundried tomato and fresh avocado. Bliss! The fries may have been a bit much on the truffle oil, but really? Who can have TOO MUCH truffle oil???  It's a pretty penny, yes, but I think management has taken a LOT of these online reviews to heart. Our service was stellar, from our hostess to our servers and busboys and even the manager came by! They even changed our TVs to the football games we wanted (because clearly no one else nearby dropped as much coin on the over as we did, natch).  Thank you AGB&B for a fine experience! We will definitely be back. Trust me when I say it is worth every penny! Especially when you hit your parlays..."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed.. writing this has we are finishing up our appetizers. It's our first time trying this place and came to celebrate our dear friends birthday. We got seated in the lounge to enjoy the happy hour. Our server came, took our drinks order and took a bit of time to get them. We ordered 3 appetizers, the crispy shrimp (very good), potstickers (good but warm, not hot) and a clam chowder (again warm, like it sat out waiting to be brought to our table). After the food was delivered by the food runner, it took about 15-20 mins before we saw and asked for our waiter. We decided to forgo the burgers, due to the lack of warmth and service. Needless to say we will now take our birthday man somewhere else to eat. I  also wish we had the food runner David (from Vegas) as our waiter. Our server was David but from Venezuela."}
{"text":"Grabbed a drink here at Anthony's Gourmet Burgers & Brews while at the M Resort.  All of their burgers on the menu incorporated some sort of beer into the recipe.  I only had the Apple martini and a green salad, so I can't say that I tried the burgers.  My boyfriend had a java stout beer.  He said it was too much bitter coffee tasting so he wouldn't order it again.  We met up with my cousin, her fiance, and her dad here for drinks.  They ordered the Totchos (tater tot nachos), Caesar salad, wings, and clam chowder.  For my salad, I asked if they had a vinaigrette which they thankfully served on the side.  It tasted predominantly of horseradish which was off-putting to me.  I kind of hated it.  The salad itself was just a green salad and was fine.  I should have gone with the garlic parmesan fries.  Oh well.  My Apple-tini was fine and strong.  For some reason, the bartender gave me a glass of water without my asking which was really nice.  No one else at in our party received any water, despite ordering beer.  Maybe it was because their drinks were not as high in alcohol content?  Who knows?  The service was fine and if I ever return to try their burgers, I'll update my review."}
{"text":"This small little place was nice but the food was over priced a lot. All sides cost extra for each meal. Since when does french fries not go with burgers? They had no beers on tap either :( This place is located inside the M hotel/casino."}
{"text":"Awesome food along with awesome views of the strip! Would recommend this to anyone. The healthy burrito is one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"They have huge and delicious burgers here, my favorite is the lager burger which has grilled onions and mushrooms.  The appetizers are great as well, including the fish tacos, potato skins, french fries and onion rings.  This is one of my go-to restaurants.  On Friday's they have a $15 prime rib dinner special, which includes a pretty good clam chowder soup."}
{"text":"I am so surprised to have had a good breakfast in the Burgers & Brews area of the M Casino! I have had terrible meals in Jayde, Anthony's, Deli and the buffet just boasts the worst lowest quality food available, in abundance. Not that I think Hash House a go go's mountain of food is a good concept either, but it was the best thing that the M had going for it until it mysteriously disappeared! So, I was not anticipating this afterthought of a morning unused space to be a good breakfast spot, but they did a good job. I had a Florentine Eggs Benedict and my husband had steak and eggs, both were cooked properly, seasoned and not overly expensive. I'm not a fan of their breakfast potatoes which are frozen square pieces that are crisped in the deep fryer and then seasoned. Why is it so hard to use some nice small potatoes to make home fries and fresh shredded ones for hash browns? If you want to have a successful breakfast restaurant it's a must to offer both. They do serve a half of a plum tomato on the savory plates which I have always thought was a good idea. Whom ever makes the food & beverage decisions for the M is lame, have you seen the latest promotions to try and save the Jayde concept? Three different ways to have a terrible Asian fusion experience! Tell me that these executives do not make over a hundred thousand a year, please tell me. Three and a half stars for breakfast in the Burgers and Brews space of the M Casino!"}
{"text":"Had the burger w/fried jalapenos. Hamburger meat tasted fresh. Bison burger was tasty but a little overcooked for medium for such a lean type of meat. The lettuce, onion, tomatoes & pickle spear is served next to the burger. If you want fries, its extra. Service is great but it seemed to take a while for the burgers to come out. Its not fast food, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and had the same experience both times.  The burgers are a good combination and very reasonably priced.  The issue is they overcook the burgers each time.   The first time I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done.  I sent it back and the replacement was medium well on 1 side and well done of the other half.  The second time I came the burger I ordered medium was also served well done.    Good concept but I won't be back sadly."}
{"text":"We came here to try to Buffet, but life's too short to wait in that long of a line! We came here instead for lunch and it has excellence ambience a modern, wide open decor. I was immediately glad we went with this option. We ordered salads, but they have a good selection of interesting looking burgers."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! Ordered the bison burger and all the toppings were just right. Cooked to perfection. Fries were a plus. Ordered sweet potato fries with a maple aoili and bacon cheddar french fries with a couple of beers."}
{"text":"Great place, all around some of the best burgers I've had. My girlfriend and I live nearby and decided to try it out. Eric our server was knowledgable about the menu and gave us some recommendations. I had the IPA and my girlfriend had the Mirco burger. Both were full of flavor and cooked perfectly. Service was fantastic, my beer glass was never empty and Eric helped me out with trying some different beers, Big Dog is something you really have to try if you like IPAs!! Also, the pear drink that they make is pretty good."}
{"text":"I loved the location and atmosphere at this M Resort bar.  The view from tall and expansive windows was simply amazing.  Good happy hour prices.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We stopped in upon checking into the hotel after a long flight into Vegas from the East Coast.  We were quite hungry and were looking to simply rest, enjoy a bite and get something to drink. The server was not very friendly.  He acted hurried and seemed to be of bad temper, but was friendly as long as you weren't trying to flag him down or ask him anything.  If you did, he would walk by you while looking for something else to do and tell you he's busy.  How rude!  (Think his name was Tim?)  We had lunch as a couple but came back a few hours later, before dinner for drinks as a larger group and we were unlucky enough to get him again.  This time he managed to upset the entire group with his antics.  Despite this guy and his level of service, the food was really nice!  The burgers, salads, fries, etc were all prepared quite nicely!  The menu has several unique items on it and is somewhat exciting!  Would we eat here again?  Yes, we'd just get a different server."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast a few times during my most recent trip to Vegas and I HIGHLY recommend this place. The food was great! Beware that if you order any of the pancakes (we tried the green tea, regular, and oatmeal) that they are HUGE and come in a stack of three and can easily be shared. Everything else we tried on the breakfast menu was amazing as well. The waffle, the French toast, and the breakfast burrito were all hits. The service was great as well and made for an overall wonderful experience. Even if you aren't staying in The M I recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Anthony's twice during our most recent stay at the M hotel in Henderson. We had one dinner and a breakfast. I had mixed feelings about both meals. It might seem a little strange to have breakfast in a brewpub but apparently the Hash House A Go Go is now no longer operating in the M so Anthony's is the only option for breakfast in the entire hotel other than room service (which has more or less the same menu but just higher prices plus additional service charge).  For dinner we both got burgers of course. After a day of drinking we both wanted something substantial in our stomachs. I went for the short rib burger since I love short ribs. I assumed it would be the meat off the bone served on a roll (pulled pork style) but to my surprise the server informed us that the short rib beef was served on top of a 1/3 pound burger patty. I went for it anyway but as expected it proved to be way too huge to eat. I would have probably gone for it a little bit more if it wasn't so greasy. The burger was sopping wet with grease. I don't know how much was from the burger patty and how much from the short rib meat but it was just too much for me to handle and it ruined the flavor of the beef. Hubby got the regular burger and was happier with his but he had also ordered the garlic Parmesan fries and those were also too greasy too eat. A greasy burger is one thing but nobody likes soggy fries.  Breakfast was a little better but unfortunately I think I once again chose the wrong thing. Hubby got steak and eggs which is what he orders everywhere and he said it as a-ok but nothing special. I went for the cranberry almond french toast since a few Yelpers had raved about it but I was pretty disappointed in it. I was expected a fresh tasting tart house made cranberry compote but instead the french toast was topped with what tasted like Craisins that had been reconstituted in sugar water and a sprinkle of slivered almonds. It was way too sweet and not very impressive.  If I stay at the M again I would probably avoid this place (except breakfast since there is no other option). But still it was not the worst hotel restaurant I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips, simply because I can't resist. But I was disappointed at the lack of flavor. Maybe I was expecting too much? Idk. AND they dropped my margarita on the way to the table. I get it, it happens, but that was just one more thing to add to my tasteless food"}
{"text":"The first place I have been too in Vegas that is on par with Bachi Burger.  The burgers are creative, textured, and extremely satisfying. Every variation of French fries are also very good, with the sweet potato fries standing out from the pack. Highly recommend on all fronts."}
{"text":"We love coming here when we're at the M resort for an event or if we have friends in town or even if we just want to have a good but not fancy dinner out. One plus (or negative depending on your view) about this place is that for dinner, the restaurant is 21+ only. The M is relatively family friendly, so it's nice to get to have a good, not too expensive meal, and not be surrounded by families with young kids.   The service here is pretty good. The staff is very friendly and are able to make good recommendations for menu items and for beer pairings. The food comes out pretty quick, but not too quick, so you know that they actually spent time making your meal, instead of just industrially cranking it out. It's also nice when you get to finish an appetizer before your entree comes out.   On to the food! The burgers are really good. My recommendations are the TTB burger, which is like a thanksgiving dinner in a bun, and the porter burger, which has pastrami and coleslaw as toppings. We also generally add a side of fries to our meal and the sweet potato ones with the maple mayo are definitely the best. I'd recommend sharing the fries. One order is good for 2-3 people. We also like the buffalo cauliflower, which comes plain with the buffalo sauce on the side, so you can add as much or as little as you'd like.   We are going to continue coming here and trying out all of the different burgers. This is a great off-the-strip burger place and one of my top 3 burger places in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"This place advertises happy hour....however, they only have half off on select food items.  No alcohol included!!!  What restaurant/bar doesn't include wine or beer in there happy hour!  Won't be returning..."}
{"text":"I really like this place! We ordered wine and appetizers and both were yummy.  I ordered the:  1.  Crispy Shrimp W/ Thai Dynamite Dipping Sauce - they were crisp, not oily and were mind numbingly good.   2. Pot Stickers Crispy Pork & Vegetable Pot Stickers W/ Ginger-Soy Dipping Sauce  - Um Yes Please. Again crispy, not oily and the dipping sauce was very good.  All in all I will go back to this place. I loved the vibe and the food here."}
{"text":"Good day Friends! CFC here with YET ANOTHER food review. :-)   I'm very pleased to introduce you all to Anthony's Gourmet Burgers & Brews. Now back when I first heard the term, \"Gourmet Burger\", I immediately thought it was a ploy to use the same meat as your typical greasy spoon, put it on a nicer plate and then triple the price. :-/  I would instantly roll my eyes when seeing the word \"Gourmet\" in front of the word \"burger\".   Anthony has forever changed my opinion on this matter. Comparing his burgers to Wendy's, McDonalds, Denny's, or even Fuddruckers (which I enjoy greatly) is like comparing apples to cheese covered 10oz Angus beef patties. They are in the IVY league of burgers my friends. I ordered the Pilsar. The beef was exquisite and, for most, there'd probably be enough of it left over AFTER you eat; to walk (OK, drive) over to the Mirage and throw a snack to the tigers (Something I don't recommend in any way... I was merely being discriptive; moving on). I didn't like that the already expensive burger ($13) didn't come with french fries, but it was a pretty big burger which leads me to believe most people wouldn't be able to finish it AND fries.  True to name, and form, I DID order french fries with mine. :-)   The fries were delicious. I've said it's nearly impossible to ruin french fries, but then I went to Hash House a-GO-GO and was quickly confronted with the COLD reality that I'm not always right. They were cut thin, seasoned just right and a half order served as more than enough to accompany the hefty burger. They, along with the burger, were a bit pricey ($4.50 for a half order).  I usually don't talk about the service at any restaurant unless it effects the food (i.e. I see the tray with my food ready to be brought to my table but it sits on a counter for 10 minutes) but our waiter was especially attentive and educated on the menu. He was very descriptive about each burger and new exactly how long it would take to cook (depending on how you'd like it cooked) etc.   Overall, Anthony's gets 4 stars from the CFC! It might have been 5 if I could afford to eat there more often. Hint Hint Hint...  Regards,  CFC"}
{"text":"I am SO disappointed in Anthony's! The ambiance looks really nice from the outside but once you sit down is where the negatives come into play.  1. The hostesses were not friendly and wanted to seat us by the bar in the dark area when the tables with a view of the pool were clearly available. They were not receptive to our desire to sit near the window. 2. Once we sat down, we tried ordering numerous brews that were on the menu but no longer in stock/not available. If you're going to advertise beer in the name of your establishment, I think its reasonable to expect our first choice brews, not fourth or fifth. 3. The burgers were made sloppy. The entire bottom half of my bun was drenched in oil (I ordered my burger medium). There is a distinct difference between having a juicy burger that spills onto the bun and straight soggy. Perhaps the food runners or servers just didn't bring our burgers out upon being ready? 4. This establishment is 21+ only. While I understand that they advertise brews,  it seems unreasonable to prohibit 21 and under after 12pm noon.   Overall, besides the wonderful view the large open windows offer, there is no reason to return."}
{"text":"The food was great!  The service was awful which is why they got docked stars.  If theyre busy you'll have wait and I think they expect you to be clairvoyant because they don't give you a pager or take your cell phone number to notify you when a table is available.  You'll have to routinely check in with the hostess.  Not good customer service. When we got seated we ordered right away which was nice, but then we waited 23 minutes for our food to arrive.  After that we didn't see the server again until we flagged him down for the check.   The food was  good but our over all experience wasn't worthy of anything more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went here on accident after the hash house closed in the M.  THE BEST veggie burger I have ever had. I have not eaten meat in 5 years so I have eaten a lot of veggie burgers. Most of the time if they are made in house they are awful and fall apart. This one was fantastic! Great flavor and texture. Great bun and cheese and I added a fried egg...perfection. Will go to the smelly casino just to get another burger!Worth the price. Great French fries also. My meat eating family was all happy with their burgers too!"}
{"text":"Went into the M looking for the Hash Hash A Go Go for breakfast.  Didn't know that it was gone, so a gorgeous casino waitress directed us to Anthony's.  Great looking place and location is overlooking the hotel pool area.  The view is north, directly at the strip. Very nice.  Raghubir was our waiter. Seemed his main job was to wait for someone else to take our drink order, come back and take our food order, glance in passing to see if we were doing okay and finally deliver our bill.  Others refilled our drinks and asked about our meal. The meals were fantastic. My uncle said his Chicken Hash was excellent and my egg white omelette was pretty good.  Potatoes were excellent also.  I think we have found a great place to eat on the way home from Vegas without having to find something in one of the strip casinos."}
{"text":"After a great night at the Hostile Grape in the M Resort, we needed to eat! I was with a group of friends and we were low maintenance. Somewhere in the M that offered great food at an affordable price was alright in our books. This place was conveniently open at the moment so the decision was made!  Speaking of convenience, this joint is directly above the Hostile. Such an easy decision! The restaurant is completely open and part of the casino. In fact, the open vibe makes for the the dramatic affect. Large floor to ceiling windows offer a lot of lighting during the day and great valley views at night. There are multiple level seating for a variety of guests. When we visited this place they are just about to close, so the service, although cordial, was a little bit rushed. Our server was very patient and nice enough to offer split checks for the table.   For my late night dinner, I decided on the Imperial burger for $13.  A burger made to order, topped with stout braised short ribs, mushrooms, Gruyere cheese and caramelized onions. This burger was served with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickle spears on the side. You also have the option to add fries for another $5. They have different flavors and toppings, however, I just chose the salt and pepper fries. Man, what an amazing burger! The temperature I chose was medium rare and it was perfectly cooked! The burger was seasoned very well. The short rib was tender and  shredded over the top and offered a sweet element. I loved the smokey taste of the Gruyere which to me, helped to marry all the flavors. This burger was delicious! The fresh fries were also a treat. You could tell they were homemade. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the fries were also seasoned lightly. Great side dish as well!  This burger joint was the perfect way to end our Friday night. It was exactly what we were hoping for: great food at an affordable price. The M Resort has really hit it on the mark with this restaurant. Couple with the Hostile, these are two great reasons to keep coming back! Thank you so much Anthony's, great food which made for a great night!"}
{"text":"The food is good but really pricy for the portion size. A burger will cost you about $11 and that doesn't include fries, that's an extra  $3. The burgers have good flavor but not worth the price. The service was ok except I felt rushed even though we were the only table."}
{"text":"This place is really good especially if you want a good burger  Burgers & Brews is located inside the M Casino right by the lobby. They are open for breakfast but after 11am it is 21 and up only.   Imperial Burger - Good. Nice seasoning with tons of short ribs loaded on your patty  Hefenwizen Chicken Sandwich - great! Grilled chicken was nice and moist. The flavors altogether was amazing   Herb Salmon - delicious! Salmon was cooked and flavored perfectly. Came with roasted asparagus and couscous   Bison Burger - Good. Not too gamey and perfectly seasoned   Truffle Fries - BEST truffle fries ever! Love the airy crispiness to their perfectly think cut fries which was loaded with Parmesan and truffle oil. A must order   Chicken wings - good. Nice and moist on the inside crispy on the outside. Sweet n spicy Thai sauce was flavorful  Buffalo Cauliflower - good size portions. Nicely battered with the buffalo dip on the side   I come here all the time. Whenever we don't feel like sittin in we call in advance and place an order for pick up which is always ready by the time we get here. If you dine in the service is great. Everyone is very attentive and the food comes out pretty quick. Will Definitely be back here again to try everything else I haven't tried yet"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to give this place a shot! I've heard from quite a few people that it's amazing...  Really great vibe! Modern, clean and a great hang. I sat on the patio tonight and really enjoyed my experience.   Food was really good (I'd give it a 4 out of 5)  Service wasn't amazing so that's what's making me give it a 3 star review. We very rarely saw our waiter and had to ask for a lot of extra stuff.   Definitely worth trying if you're already out at the M but don't expect to be blown away by the service."}
{"text":"I may have reviewed Anthony's when it first opened but we ate there again tonight (probably for the 5th or 6th time) and I felt I had to revisit my thoughts. The last few times before today it felt as if they stopped trying but tonight was phenomenal. Appetizers were crispy wings and pot stickers , both very good. The stars of the evening were the white sangria (we could only get out of the server that Chardonnay and Apple Pucker were involved ( he would not reveal all the ingredients)  and the  Red Ale Burger...oh my.....medium rare delicious burger covered with sunny side  up egg wth crisp bacon, amber ale mornay sauce and o'brien potatoes ( hash browns)  with lettuce tomatoe and pickles on the side (I piled them on)....freaking delicious. I'd do it again and again. Check out Anthony's Gourmet Burgers at M if you live in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Overall It was a disappointment,  but to their benefit it was busy.  We placed our names (4 in our party) on the wait list, approximately 10-15 min later we were seated. The hostess did not say much sat us and was gone. Our waiter was rushed and to the point.  Food is over priced for what you get, fries are $5.99 and you get more at McDonald's for a fraction of the price. Burger had no real outstanding flavor that makes it great. It was okay for a hotel burger so I didn't have to fight traffic but overall i was disappointed.  The thing for me was waiting 20 min after we were done eating to receive our check so we could leave."}
{"text":"Very cool place to come and enjoy some great burgers, drinks and apps..  Great service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Space is off the lobby with views of the pool and the Strip - great atmosphere. Vibe was sports oriented with lots of flat screens broadcasting the Wisconsin v Arizona NCAA game.   Burger was good but the service ( Erin  from South Dakota) was not. It took 40 minutes to get our burgers and the Rings arrived at table cold and in edible. They comp'd our coconut shrimp app and the rings - which was appreciated. But would have preferred to have gotten our food timely and hot. The establishment was not particularly busy - so it was hard to imagine what the problem was....judging from other yelp reviews this place has service issues."}
{"text":"Possibly the greatest burgers I've ever had. Lots of options. Stout burger with Irish cheddar, stone ground mustard, bacon. Soooo dang good. Please don't get me started on the lobster burger. Available on Fridays! Great service and the cherry on top was ordering the jalape√±o margarita. Extremely fair prices."}
{"text":"Started off poorly. After being seated we waited 10 minutes without a single server coming to our table. I finally asked the hostess if someone could come take our order. Finally a server showed up and we ordered 2 beers, an appetizer and our main course. Waited another 5 minutes without a drink - she brought the plates for us to use for the appetizer but no drinks so we asked for water. I watched her go fill two water glasses and leave our beers at the bar. When she brought the water she said \"the beer would be up when it's ready\". . Finally a different server bright our beers. There are at least four servers and it's not packed in here so I'm not sure why the service is so incredibly slow. However the food was excellent. One of the best burgers I've had (the IPA burger). Hopefully the service isn't this slow all the time because that was the only downfall."}
{"text":"Have you ever really,  really wanted to like something but no matter how much you tried it just didn't change the fact that something sucked? Well,  that's this place.  Poorly cooked food (my burger came way more than just,  it was raw in the center) and very bland.  Once they actually cooked my food,  it still had no taste and clearly leaked seasoning and flavor.  I found the service lacking, as in no  refills on  drinks in a timely manner and took way to long to order and for the food to come out.  For the price you pay here, you should just look elsewhere to give your money for quality food because this place isn't it. Vegas is certainly not lacking for food or burger places"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I tried at the m resort. My friends and I had a great experience and would definitely come back again.   Pros: -quality food with great prices -$5 beer?! Woot woot! -best sweet potato fries ever -juicy burger  -most crispy wings  -be sure to try the fried snickers, it's totally different than fair food. Not greasy at all.  -large portion of food  Cons: -limited menu, dinner menu consists mostly burgers  -closes at 11pm -restaurant is open for breakfast. However, be sure to arrive EARLY to avoid lines!! Everyone will be there for breakfast because buffet does not open until 11am!!"}
{"text":"Am I overly impressed by Anthony's? Not really. Did I enjoy myself and have a great time with my friends? Yes. They have a well balanced selection of beer. It is not the most extensive, but there are some curve balls that I appreciated. The grapefruit ale was rather delightful on the warm evening I dined there. It is perfect for summer and reminded me of a shandy.   The burgers were all decent. Each burger is named after a beer. Said beer is used in the cooking process of the burger itself. It wasn't incorporated into the meat, but in some other element of the burger. The Imperial was the best. Stout braised short rib on top of a burger? Braised short rib on everything is more like it! The IPA was the other burger that impressed me. I am a sucker for spicy food. So a BBQ sauce with a nice kick, topped with hatch chile, and fried jalapenos screwed out to me. The Red Ale preparation was over kill on the breakfast in between a bun novelty. The potatoes o'brien was unnecessary. I was also unimpressed with the Stout Burger. As for the fries, they didn't have the nice crunch I was hoping for and went cold fast. The garlic cheese fries were good. The sweet potato were lackluster. Same could be said with the Ultimate Potato Skins. They were just ordinary in nature.   I will say that we each had a beer or cocktail, an appetizer to start, individual burgers and an order of fries and left with our wallets in tack. It is a decent deal for everything you get."}
{"text":"With such a highly esteemed name for a restaurant, you'd think this place would serve some of the best burgers in town with world class service.   You'd think wrong.  I made reservations for 8 here for my birthday dinner a few weeks back.  The hostess taking my reservation was the same one who was there to greet us with a table already made up for the group, and she was fine with a couple of us waiting for more from our party to show up.   So far so good.  Once the majority of the party (6 of 8) had shown up, we decided to be seated and we immediately asked the waiter if we could do separate checks.  He said that they do not do that there.  \"At all?\"  \"Right.  Never\"   We shrugged it off as no big deal and started ordering drinks.  I've had Jack and Cokes all throughout this great city of ours and I gotta say this was a piss poor example.  Very watered down, and no surprise that 4 of them later I barely had a buzz going.  Strike one.  I ordered the IPA Burger with Sweet Potato fries (I'm a sweet potato slut).   Several at my table ordered a variety of other burgers and fries.  Most of us ordered our own order of fries and when they came out there were way too many for each individual to eat.  I thought it would have been nice for the server to maybe say each order could feed 2, but I won't hold them to that.  I personally loved the sweet potato fries with the maple sauce, even though it tastes exactly as it sounds: very syrupy, very rich.   Others at my table werent nearly as impressed.  They are much skinnier than I am.  The burger was quite simply a disappointment.  The meat was alright, and prepared the way I ordered (medium rare), but the problem was the lack of flavor outside of the meat itself.  The IPA is supposed to have a BBQ spiced burger patty, roasted hatch chilies, pepper jack cheese and fried jalapenos.   I honestly never felt a kick in the least.  Another at my table that also ordered it said the same.  Not sure how that is possible with those ingredients.  Seasoning in general needed work, and I heard from someone else at my table with the Imperial that the short ribs were flavorless (a sentiment I've seen shared by others here).  Maybe it's the pumped in oxygen into the M that somehow renders these burgers nearly tasteless.  Overall service was fairly pleasant, and they even hooked me up with a free jack and coke for my birthday, and replaced a spilled one (no I swear, I wasnt drunk) for free.   BUT, at the end of the meal, the waiter comes up with our check, and announces that the last couple to arrive asked for their check to be split.  WAIT WHAT?  A few of us immediately brought up the fact that earlier he said they dont do that at ALL.  We were promptly ignored.  Look, I get that he initially wanted to not split the check probably for the forced 18% gratuity or what have you, but there's no need to lie about it.    Be thankful you hooked me up with those free jack and cokes and that I'm such a whore for sweet potato fries and maple syrup Anthony's, I'm being generous with my 2."}
{"text":"Soft shell crab sandwich and cheddar bacon fries!"}
{"text":"Happy hour on weekends!? You've got me sold on that one. I came with a friend and we tried the Asian Chicken Salad and the Buffalo Cauliflower which, I've been wanting to try since I'm newly vegetarian, with the creamy bleu cheese sauce. I wasn't a big fan of bleu cheese until I tried it with this dish, GAME CHANGER! Also, I had a Caesar Salad which was a good old fashioned Caesar salad.   Overall, great ambiance and good customer service. Will give it another try!"}
{"text":"Burgers and Brews is a good place to have quick and easy and casual eats within the M resort and hotel. We've eaten here on occasion when hanging out, especially when visiting the pool.   They have a good variety of drinks including craft beer and wine. The food is usual bar fare with nachos and burgers topping the most popular items. We enjoyed their tater tots and burgers to share (I try to try everything and can easily do that without one huge entree to myself!)  The service is always on point with the servers checking in on us and making sure to place our orders with changes requested!   If you're hanging out at the M and want a restaurant to eat at, not on the casino floor or super fancy, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"People, this was a good freakin burger. All four of us loved our food.   Plus they had Pumpkick beer, which no one ever has, and the fries are seriously good. They do that whole sweet potato fry with bacon maple sauce and I wish I could just hug the M for having all of my favorite things in one restaurant.   The price point isn't bad either. Four people and about $80 for the table. For Vegas, that's pretty stellar.   We dined out on the patio, overlooking the pool in the evening on a Saturday. We expected to wait to get a table, but they sat us right away.  It was my friend's birthday, so one of us secretly told the server. She brought out an enormous hunk of red velvet cake with a candle, even though it was windy as could be (she also brought us a book of matches so we could re-light it. How thoughtful).   I'm definitely returning when friends/family come to Vegas to visit. Just a great place to chill and have a great burger/beer."}
{"text":"Easy 5 star experience all around. Eric is a great server.  I was scratching my head to figure out a place to have her birthday dinner.  So, Anthony's, being close, sounded good.  And, I'm a total sucker for a good burger.  And, a good burger is what we had.  We had reservations for 7 on Thursday Jan. 2nd.  Even if we didn't have reservations, we would have still been seated immediately.  The place was very quiet.  We were seated by the window overlooking the pool.  But, the pool area was dark so you couldn't see it very well.  But, you could see the distant lights and that was nice.  The hostess asked us if the table was ok as there was a little draft coming though.  We decided to move to a different table.  So accommodating.  We had a chance to look through our menu's while our drinks were being made.  Eric, our server, came to the table and answered our questions and made a couple of recommendations as well.  He was extremely helpful.  I went with the Imperial Burger and asked it with no onions.  She got the I.P.A. burger with all of the fire on it.  I'm not into the over spicy but the burger looked great.  Eric brought out our burgers and mine came out with the onions on top.  I had to send it back.  Can't do Onions!!!  So, the problem was rectified promptly.  Eric came out and apologized for the mix up.  Stuff like that happens so it wasn't a big deal.    We feasted on the burgers, which were cooked perfectly.  Juicy and messy, just the way a burger should be.  We also had some Garlic Parm Fries which was a great side.  I could eat those as my main course.  Eric then came out with a piece of Red Velvet Cake as a comp.  I think it was because they put onions on my burger.  Great customer service.  We also ordered a piece of Peanut Butter pie which was decadent and sweet.    This may become our new place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times and never had a bad meal.  The prime rib and burgers and beer all good."}
{"text":"It's our favorite happy hour!!!    Tatchos!!   Clam Chowder! Wings! And everything else on appetizer menu are half price and taste great!  Never a bad experience here!!"}
{"text":"One of the better burger places in town in one of my favorite casinos.  The M Resort is a beautiful, clean, rich looking property.   I always feel right at home here.  The Burgers and Brews is right next to Anthony's Steak House which is also a good choice if you want a higher end meal.  Back to Burgers and Brews........  The service could have been better which is why the four star rating instead five.   The burger was great.  The fries were crispy, seasoned perfectly and piping hot.  I will go here for lunch or a casual dinner anytime."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and enjoyed the food. The view to the pool area was nice to have. I ordered the Chicken Santa Fe breakfast wrap and enjoyed every bite! It came with   potatoes in the side and sour cream. Very large portions too  price is reasonable and service was great! We stay at hotel M at least twice a year and always enjoy our stay!"}
{"text":"Food was unbelievable. Service impeccable- the waiter Florin even overheard our conversation about celebrations and brought chocolate covered strawberries at the end. The buss staff was also incredible. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Very good food, good prices. The soft shell crab sandwich was spot on. The service is hit or miss, and I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars if I could give halves. Too bad you can't order a draft from the 32 Degree Bar across the casino. This place only offers bottled beers, though it is a decent selection. I was offended when they offered me a chilled glass. Save that for the cheap beers, y'all."}
{"text":"Should you eat here? YES! YES, you should. You won't be disappointed. Excellent quality in burgers. Very well priced. I would return hands down. I had a lager burger. Very well prepared. Juiciest, well prepped, and very big for a $10 price. What a deal! Chef's high quality standard burger. Sooo big! I couldn't finish it...wanted to! I will be back for more. Don't skip the fries either...even if you are dieting! Enjoy, and thank me later :)"}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EAT AT ANTHONY'S BEER AND BREW AT THE M RESORT AGAIN!! If you like yr drinking water to look like a snow globe and it takes them 15 minutes to get u cream for yr coffee (now cold) and when yr order comes out and its not complete and they go back to get the rest and never return this is the place for you!! HELL NO.....NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"A lil disappointed that the prime rib special ended but was still posted on the website but that allowed me to Try the amazing imperial burger coupled with sweet potato fries a a sinfully delicious maple dipping sauce. I also sampled the chicken wings with there many variations of sauces (tie sauce is my fav) def will be returning"}
{"text":"Anthony's is a perfect little eatery located in the M. Being one that isn't fond of hiking through a hotel/casino for a gourmet meal I am a huge fan of the location. Close to the Las Vegas Blvd side of the M or directly in the main doors from the valet, you aren't parking far or walking 500 miles. Classy casual (I don't think you can class up burgers and beer much), so don't have your lady tie up your black bow tie for this date night.  The burgers are unique and have interesting flavors. Stout burger? Sign me up! The combinations aren't your standard lettuce, cheese, tomato so be ready to step out of the box. They also make pairing suggestions to help you if you don't know the difference between a Lager and a Pilsner.  Being an avid beer drinker and burger connoisseur, I was slightly offended when our server was a little to green for a place with a little more meat (pun intended) to the menu. I expect basic beer knowledge. The beers here are not your dive bar Millers and Buds.   Sadly, the M is really missing out on an awesome pairing that isn't. The M Resort also has an AMAZING Beer Bar located at the OPPOSITE end of the casino. It's a shame that Anthony's isn't getting to share in those taps."}
{"text":"Our burgers were salty and nothing special.  Don't go out of your way to try this place.  The service ws very slow.  There were only a few others in the restaurant.  When I asked the server if the kitchen was backed up, he said, \"No.\" the only compliment I can give it are for the truffle fries and white cheddar bacon fries.  Burger Bar and In-N-out are way better"}
{"text":"My expectations had been high.  So this was a bit of a letdown.  Vegetarian options are nearly nonexistent.  Being the primary place to eat at the M Resort we ate here every day.  Primarily for breakfast.  Which was good but nothing overly special.  The 5 Dollar Berry Bowl was definitely well presented.  Wish we had known about it sooner.    Our first days omelets had been rather flat and flavorless but following days presented a marked improvement.  I was informed it was the same chef.    Bar martini's had been very good but our spot at the bar just looked into the busy work area of the staff.  Leaving us feeling distant and unengaged.  The bar was VERY busy but staff did manage to provide on-par service.    Would have likely settled into other eating venues if they had been available.  We ended up going off property to eat after our first night."}
{"text":"Great tasting signature burgers and decent side dishes.  Had the ahi tuna, cheddar bacon fries, and stout burger.  The stout burger has irish cheddar, smoked bacon, and ground stout mustard.  Very nice, but a little slow.  The burger was flavorful, and the mustard enhanced the taste overall but wasn't intrusive.  They need to put in a fois gras burger, I would totally go for that."}
{"text":"Met up with a couple friends for lunch at the M, specifically Burgers and Brews (about the only place open). Friendly staff greeted us, we asked for an indoor table (115 outside) that overlooked the pool.   We had apps of crispy shrimp in a thai dynamite sauce, and beer battered onion rings with a smoky bacon dip. I also ordered a pilsner burger, and one friend had the Asian chicken salad and the other the strawberry and spinach salad. Basically the two fat guys ordered salad, and the skinny one went full burger!   Everything was really tasty, especially the burger. Drinks and water were filled and service was very good.   I'd come back again just for the burger menu as so many sound good."}
{"text":"I've grown to really appreciate this place. The food is solid and drink selection great.  Half price appetizers at the bar the best!"}
{"text":"The service here is a COMPLETE disaster, from our waitress to the management to the kitchen.   FYI: Our waitress tonight was Jackie.   My fianc√© and I came here for a simple date night dinner. The first disappointment was that this place does not serve beer on tap.   We then ordered two Micro Burgers and an order of Parmesan fries to share. The fries came out first, about 20 minutes before our burgers. Don't know if it was the loud atmosphere or the language barrier, but our waitress got our burger orders wrong. She brought us each a burger with grilled mushrooms and heavy cheese. Once we grabbed her attention, we let her know that these were not the burgers we ordered, maybe someone else's? After much back & forth, she finally understood our problem, apologized and offered to have the cook \"scrape off mushrooms and put goat cheese on them\". She explained that this would be much faster than waiting for a fresh Micro Burger. Uh, no. Who even offers that? WTF???  And then? She returned with the same burgers, just with the mushrooms scraped off. Really?!?! OMG....so angry.   We politely told her these were again, NOT what we ordered and did not just want the mushrooms scraped off. We wanted MICRO burgers, which came with goat cheese, avocado and marinated tomatoes. She actually said \"that goat cheese\" and pointed to the melted cheddar cheese on the burgers. OMG, really?!?! Now she's just lazy and thinks we are stupid and trying to push the current burgers off on us anyways??? WOW. Completely unacceptable.   We knew at this point that we were gonna be here awhile waiting for the kitchen to do it right. In the meantime, our fries got cold so we ordered another basket as a fresh replacement.   She came back a third time with the correct burgers. Why the hell this took so long is beyond me. New fries were served as well. We ate our dinner an hour later than we planned. The fries here were limp and greasy, the burgers....after all that mess....were just ok.   We got our check and just wanted to pay and get out. The service was beyond horrible and our waitress knew it. The manager knew it. But the attitude here was a big fat OH WELL, WE DON'T CARE! There was never an offer to comp any of this disaster, we were actually charged for two burgers and two fries. I paid for it, but I was pretty disgusted.   So: That being said, we will not be back. We're locals and we love a lot about the M Resort, but there's no way in hell I will be back at this burger hole. I will also think twice before driving out there for the wine bar, the day spa or the buffet as well. Which sucks. Service is everything.   We will also make sure friends and family are aware of the poor treatment we received. It was just plain wrong. No sense of customer service here whatsoever. Big fat FAIL."}
{"text":"Great service on a windy day patio was close of course lol Camilo bartender was good my burger to but the only serve breakfast on the am the kitchen is the same they should have full menu .."}
{"text":"The happy hour is limited, only serving at tiny amount of items and only served at the bar area.  You move over to the dining area and pay full price for stuff on HH.  Not a fan.  I would give this 2 stars.    Onto the good stuff.  Their burgers are gourmet, filled with all type of great toppings and simply divine.  We also ordered the tater tot nachos, which is topped with guacamole, sour cream, onion and lightly drizzled with cheese.  I probably haven't had taters since grade school.    Beautiful ambiance, nice and open with great service.   If you want a cheat meal, then come here."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that the Happy Hour menu on the M Resort Web site lists different apps than on the menu at the restaurant. Poor advertising! I had the kobe sliders which were very good if not a tad overpriced at $10 (not part of happy hour). My one glass of wine, a good white, went well with the sliders.  I've also had a speciality burger here and tried the onion rings a while ago. The burger was above average and I'd like to try a few other burgers to compare!  If you sit near the windows you'll have a nice view of the pool, and there's some outdoor seating as well.  The M has an excellent choice of restaurants, and this one offers some great eats."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 8pm, we had actually made a reservation for 8:30pm but ended up arriving early and we were seated promptly.  The food was great!  I had the IPA Burger with fried jalapenos, roasted hatch chilies and pepper jack cheese! MMM!  The other people in my party enjoyed their foods as well, 2 Stout Burgers and an Imperial Burger.  The Parmesan cheese fries were fantastic and I wished I didn't have to share.  :)  My reason for the four stars is that I felt the service was a little slow for a not so busy evening.  We actually had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  Over all we will be back when we are craving a yummy burger!"}
{"text":"Great for burger and brews with an excellent happy hour. Today I wanted to go to the Hash House but found out they were no longer at the M; I was told by one of the girls that this place served a pretty mean breakfast!!! Our waitress Heather was lively and delight!!! We hung outside near poolside and the food was excellent... Thumbs up"}
