{"text":"Food was excellent - the Saag was the freshest I have ever had!  The ambiance was a little lacking including the smear of dried food on my menu.  Overall I was happy with the experience but I am entering the receipt in my accounting software just now and noticing that they included a tip themselves ($9.30) plus I added a $12 tip.  That's hefty.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I had another Groupon.  I really wanted to like them so I guess I would try again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The four of us ordered one appetizer, then waited for almost an hour for only two of the entrees. The waitress didn't bring out the other entrees until we complained nearly 20 mins later. After which she failed to bring water for the table. The food was just okay."}
{"text":"This cute little place with an inviting patio quickly became the pit of starvation and lack of service despair. Save your money... When we were finally acknowledged, and the server stopped telling us of how busy she was, we ordered a beer. So... It took 15 minutes to be acknowledged another 15 to get water, another 30 to get a beer and another 40 minutes for the food to arrive. We were one of two tables. It was complete craziness! An hour and 40 minutes before our single-course arrived for lunch is truly unacceptable. This poor girl knew nothing about Indian food. I suppose that it is not totally her fault, someone should provide her with some training. The paneer in the mutter paneer was surprisingly chewy. They are more like cheese curds and even squeeked! The rice was over cooked and the garlic naan was burnt, and not lightly. Not to mention that when I asked for ghee the server said \"what's that?\" Ha... The real kicker is this place is not cheap. The bill came to $49! For 2ppl for lunch that was barely edible and was barely served. Our server realized that our experience was a grand disappointment and only added to it by selling out a team member. She said, \"I know you had a bad meal. I'm sorry. The other guy in the kitchen is better. He's off today.\" I hope I'm not ever on a sinking ship with this chick! A note to the owners... You should really consider selling this place, and let the cool location be taken up by real industry professionals. If not, perhaps take a trip to India town and see how the flurry of Classic Indian restaurants operate."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give this place a bad review, but I've been here about 10 times now, (I even used to be the Foursquare mayor!) and every time I go, I'm on the verge of punching someone by the time I leave.   Let me say first off, the food is great, the patio is great, the live music is great. But the kitchen speed is literally the slowest I have EVER experienced, anywhere, EVER. Also, the service is pretty weak (maybe because the serving staff can't stand the kitchen) and the prices are pretty high for a mid-level experience.   I've put up with it because it's one of the nicer places in Kensington, but I can't, in good conscience, keep going back. The last straw was when my boyfriend and I decided to go there for date after a crazy week, and treat ourselves. That meant we were *going to* have a three course meal with wine. Welll....  Apps took 40 minutes to get there, then the bottle of wine was done by the time the mains came out about AN HOUR after the apps had come (not exaggerating). We're easy going people and had no where else to be, so we didn't make a fuss, even though we were STARRRVVVING. We ordered more naan a little bit into the meal, which showed up after the food was gone (even though we *tried* to eat slowly so that we'd still have some left). The waiter was nice enough, though he never addressed the fact that we were clearly waiting FOREVER... which makes me think he's so used to it, he doesn't care about that anymore. We had planned to have dessert, but by then, my temper was ready to flare, so I figured it was safer to just get out of there.   Like I said, this has happened several times before, but this was the last straw. We were there, involuntarily for 2.5 hours for 2 dishes. There's definitely better Indian options in the city."}
{"text":"If you want good Indian food don't go here.  Food is very basic, dishes they serve it in are dirty and so is the table."}
{"text":"CLOSED!!! Beware - Website is still up and running. It even allows you to make a reservation. I showed up Friday evening for what I thought was going to be an excellent first experience, but the place was gated up :("}
{"text":"Sadly I can't give no stars. This place is a travesty. Dishwater-tasting cocktails. Abysmal service. Mixed up orders. Food that never appears. And when we tried to get the bill to leave, they added on stuff we never had the chance to eat. How is this place still in existence in Toronto?!"}
{"text":"As far as Indian food in Toronto goes, this is a winner! More than that... Waterfalls is king! Sometimes Halsey and Nash are craving a Chicken Korma and this is the only place to take them. Exotic herbs and spices that just make you can't wait for the werewolf and then you will love it just like I do. There's no indian. No other Indian like Waterfalls and I give it two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars not because it's perfect, but because I love it.  I have been there twice, and both times I had a great experience.  To be fair,  both times were during a quiet time (sunday evening), but I found nothing lacking.    Since the place is indoor/outdoors, there is no air conditioning, but the server was happy to point a fan in our direction when we asked, and kept our water glasses full the whole time.  She was attentive without being annoying, and as I former server I am hyper aware of the quality of service at an establishment.    Food was timed perfectly and the portions were great - I kept some for lunch the next day.  The sangria was lovely - clearly made with good wine - and the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender.  My companion had a tikka masala pizza and I had the Madras chicken.  It was great - it had just enough heat to be flavourful without being overly spicey.    This was the perfect place to have dinner after seeing the Picasso exhibition at the AGO, and I'm really glad we chose this place."}
{"text":"Appetizer: 1 star Entree: 4 star Service: 1 star  We got there at 6:40, and it was not crowded at all. After we sat down, I noticed the table was still very greasy and dirty, so I asked them to clean it. This guy wiped the table with this dirty mop, and that made the table stinky.  So I had to ask for a table cloth, and they were quite reluctant.   After waiting for quite a while for somebody to take our order, we had to wave to somebody and the waiter finally came around.   Appetizer somosa was probably the worst I've had in Toronto: thick breading, dry filling, and overall very poor quality.   After appetizer, we waited for more than 35 minutes for our entrees, and that was simply TOOO LONG. There were like, no more than 10 tables in the whole restaurants, and we got some very generic dishes that does NOT require special preparation.   At least the food was pretty decent, beef vindaloo was moist, spicy, and beef was cooked to juicy & tender. Eggplant dish was refreshing and nicely seasoned.   Overall, I would say, visit if you are not starving and willing to wait for your food.  Skip the appetizers because you are likely to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Edited up to 4 star from 3 after second visit for dinner. This time we sat on the patio, just two of us instead of a group, and service again was very friendly but much quicker. Everything was tasty, very good actually. Mussels and curry sauce was a bit too salty but everything else was fresh and packed with flavour. Naan bread, rice, califlower with potato, masala chicken curry, Sleemans honey brown beer. Yum yum!  previous experience as a group...  For dinner: Service Friendliness 5/5 Service and Food Speed 1/5 Taste Food and Beverage 4/5 Food hot, drinks cold 5/5 Ambiance 2/5 Music 0/5 Seating 4/5 Decor 2/5 Uniqueness 5/5 Value 4/5 Price $$ / go all out for only $$$  Note *When walking by at lunch, there are casual and business people and families and tourists. The lunch food looks fantastic - wraps and salads, etc.  Went on a Saturday at 7:30 with a group of 12 for my birthday. Wasent hard getting a reso the day before. Place is priced well with a really large menu and beer, cocktail and wine menu. Good for groups, we even had more people join later. Food was tasty and hot, cocktails were mixed well.  Place is unique and interesting but also a little strange... Looks like fine dining from the website photos but it's not. It's very casual and very much a Kensington market restaurant. The white table clothes kind of throw you off.  At 9:30 they start setting up for live music or djs, usually reggae. The place turns into a bar / club. It's super loud and ruins your dining experience.   I would go again with a group but will leave before 9:30. Patio was full the entire time. With us and a few other tables inside it was about 35% full inside.  Service was very very slow, so don't be in a rush. The slowest I've ever seen. Kitchen was very slow eapecially for Indian food. They were friendly but slow and maybe a bit under staffed. We waited a good 20 minutes between drinks and longer for food.  For 12 people to share food and not even finish it all, with lots of cocktails and beer, tip and tax it was $53 per person. pretty decent."}
{"text":"Tapas/appertizers where excellent. Butter chicken also very good. Nice patio in the sun with some nice Sangria."}
{"text":"Scene: snowy Saturday afternoon in January, laden down with produce, Chinese buns, sofrito and eggplant, heading over to Waterfalls at 5pm to redeem my $50 Groupon.  Characters: RJ (me) & DIana (upstairs neighbour & dining companion)  I entered first while Diana finished her cigarette (you tell her, I'm not saying anything - we all choose our own crutch, I say), and the place was empty, except for 3 staff and one local character who appeared to have come in for warmth.  So what does our cute waiter do but seat me at a table for 2 against the wall. Really? There's two of us, we are going to order a minimum of $50 worth of food, and you sit us at the smallest table in the place?  Once I suggested that I take a bigger table unless they expect to be swamped in the next 30 minutes, things started to improve.  Beverages: chai tea (RJ), Flying Monkey pint (RJ), and cranberry soda (D)  OK, credit for having a quality craft beer on tap, and there appeared to be a good selection of bottles and draft.  The chai tea really hit the spot. I'm not aficionado of chai tea, but this was rich, fragrant, and was just what I needed.  Dishes:   Waterfalls Vegetable Combo Platter (Samosas, onion bajias, veggie pakoras)  Chicken Jalfrezi (Cooked with a spicy thick masala)  Chicken Chettinad (Nuts)  (With curry leaves, tomatoes, grated coconut, ginger and chettinad spices, contains cashew nuts)  Lamb Biryani  Cheese Naan (Mozzarella Cheese)  Starting with the naan, I did ask the server where the cheese was on or in this naan. He seemed to agree that he didn't see any cheese. Turns out it is IN the naan. Tasty, a touch greasy, but enjoyed by both of us.  The combo platter (I posted pictures here of these dishes) was perfect for sharing - 2 of everything. A nice started and a good variety.  All the meat dishes had large, tender morsels. The jalfrezi was the star of the meal for me. The masala sauce was spicy (as I requested) but was respectful of my tastebuds as well, if you know what I mean.  The chettinad was my least favorite dish, but that is just a matter of personal taste. The sauce was a bit too creamy and I couldn't taste any coconut, but you may enjoy it. It is a dish that you could share, as we did with all our dishes.  I give this place 4 stars because the food spoke for itself and the service was helpful with recommendations. My opinion is also coloured by the fact that I was saving $25 off my bill by using the $50 Groupon."}
{"text":"I walked into Waterfalls late on a rainy Sunday evening when almost nothing else was open in Kensington Market, so they got points for being available right off the bat, and I was looking for Indian food so that made me even happier. Given it was empty the service was attentive and good, though it was of course not possible to judge that dimension under regular conditions.  I had two glasses of the M.S. Organic beer, which was smooth and light as promised, and which I enjoyed immensely! I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, which was good but not amazing, naan, which was hot and excellent, white basmati rice, again hot and just right, and some mango chutney, which was brought in a nice amount. I finished the meal, which I savored and enjoyed every bite of by the way, with a pot of very good, hot chai tea, and a great desert recommended by the waiter, Rasmalai (a cottage cheese-like, sweet white desert with some chopped pistachios), which was cool and creamy and wonderful!  All in all a wonderful place which I would send others too, without suggesting it was the ONLY place to go if it were too busy for example."}
{"text":"I spent one long summer evening on the patio with a friend. The sangria was delicious, but mostly because I was in the mood for cold, juicy wine. It wasn't traditional in any way that I could identify. That said, don't make the same mistake I made - just order a pitcher  from the get go. Don't screw around with single glasses.  We shared the appetizer platter (onion bhaji, samosas, and veggie pakoras) and it was all fried and fine. The mint raita was creamy and refreshing and the tamarind sauce was sweet and rich. Both were excellent. We also ate the one-step-up-from-mixed-greens salad (though I'm fairly sure they had a fancier name for it) and were impressed with the selection and number of vegetables in it. Lots of chunks of peppers, broccoli, cucumber, and tomatoes in addition to the lettuce.   The patio is great in that the chairs and tables are comfy enough and there's no tacky product paraphernalia cluttering things up. Our server was adorable and attentive, though you'd think she'd never seen two grown women getting drunk before, with all the giggling she did.   I'd like to go back when it's not so g-d hot out so I can try something spicy involving lamb. Unfortunately the inside space looks a fair bit ritzier than the patio feels and it might be a bit much for me to venture in there."}
{"text":"I had such a bad time the first time I was here I blocked it out of my memory altogether which is how I ended up here a second time. This time round the slow service and cold food at least made enough of an impression that i remembered to never go here again. On the upside, at least the sangria was decent.  The dining room was less than a third full but our sever seemed to have trouble looking after three tables. He was nice enough and enthusiastic but that doesn't mean much when the kitchen forgets to cook your order. Our appetizers showed up cold after an hour and a bit but a mixture of fear that I would never see them again and gnawing hunger kept me from sending them back. An hour after that our meals made the scene and were at least warm this time. Our waiter somehow thought that bringing us two waters that we didn't ask for would  make things better and salvage a tip. No dice.  My food was ok. It tasted like cooked lamb and the veggies were very fresh. As in, \"just taken out of the fridge and cooked five minutes ago\" fresh. Our appetizer would have been fine if it were warm when it showed up.  Now I know what you're thinking, \"Why didn't you speak up sooner, complain to the manager or just get up and leave?\" and I would have been within my rights to do all of the above. The truth is, I didn't notice how much time was passing because I was having a nice drink and good conversation. Does that mean this place should get a better rating? My lord no. I just know I won't be making the mistake of eating here again and hopefully I can steer some other people away too.  If you're looking for places to eat in the market then do yourself a favour and pick any one of a number of places literally forty steps in any direction from waterfalls. You'll be much happier walking away knowing that you didn't pay an arm and a leg for snail's paced mediocrity."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars*  The only thing worth coming in for is the 9.99 lunch special from 12-3. You get curry, rice, and naan and although it takes forever, it tastes pretty good. It's made fresh to order. Servers are all amazing, super nice and friendly. There is no hostess, busser, or barback, and servers double as bartenders so while they're really busy, they're still great.   My problems with Waterfalls include:  -Waiting forever for meals. Don't come hungry. Or in a rush. This is the kind of place you'll want to go if you want to have a long conversation with your dining partner, or if you want to read a book.  -They have about 10 beer taps available but maybe 2 beer kegs at a time. And they will often run out of beer half way through the pour, and will not substitute a different beer for their Tuesday pint special.   -Portions aren't huge. If you're not on time for the lunch special, you have to order rice and naan separately so it ends up being pretty expensive.   -The wifi is terrible.   -The rice is either cold or obviously microwaved. If you have the option, stick with the naan which is made fresh to order.   Waterfalls has potential but I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, Indian food is always a special treat because of all the bright flavors that aren't always available with other veggie fair.   We visited Waterfalls on a Monday evening, and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Our waitress was pleasant but not very helpful with the questions we had about the menu. (There are ALWAYS questions when it comes to Indian food!)   The vegetarian combo platter (Samosas, onion bajias, veggie pakoras) was decent, but the brown sauce that accompanied it was amazing! We couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was, and considered asking the waitress but decided it would have been a waste of time.   We also ordered two veggie dishes (Madras Mix Veg. Curry and Aloo Mutter) and some garlic naan. It was all just alright.  Overall, Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was nothing special. The decor was nice, the artwork on the walls was interesting, but when the highlight of a meal is an undefinable \"brown sauce\", I won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"I read all the negative reviews and thought I'd take a pass on this place, but then wound up meeting friends there anyway. Only a few tables were occupied so maybe we were lucky, but we found the service to be great, the food was excellent and the portions were very generous. We really, really liked this place!!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed by the food , service . First visit was 4* but last Tuesday food was not like last time we visit . All food was gone bad shrimp . Chicken tikka masala was so bad looks like someone is learning how to cook . Server never ask us she was bg talking ,"}
{"text":"I've walked by this restaurant several times and always been confused by their concept- Indian \"Tapas\"? I just couldn't picture what this could be. This past weekend, we walked by and saw a bustling patio and a sign advertising Sangria pitcher Special. I should've trusted my first instinct which was to think \"what kind of Indian restaurant serves Sangria????!!\" My answer- a restaurant this isn't doing very well and wants to lure you in with booze- I fell for it.   The menu is fairly generic with all the regular Indian dishes. I was hoping to find some creative \"tapas\" but I was disappointed to see that their tapas section was essentially Indian appetizers. We ordered the vegetarian combo, chilli chicken and the calamari (I was hoping for something special with the calamari). Well, it my fault for ordering way too much fried food. None of the dishes stood out in any way (the dips were refreshing though). The calamari was over-breaded and the chilli chicken looked like fast food.  We were just happy to finish our Sangria and pay the bill."}
{"text":"Waterfalls is tucked away in the Kensington Market area.  We ventured here craving tapas and indian food - the fact they were both made it a clear winner for dinner.  We enter the place was empty which seemed weird for a Friday night.  We got seated right away.  We decided that we going to only try the Tapas (appetizers) for dinner.  We ordered several plates of their meat and vegetarian platters.  The fried pakoras were tasty but a bit greasy, also they were big in size in comparison to traditional pakoras.  The meat tapas were ok.  I really like the sauces that accompanied our dishes.  With our meal, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria which was delish and at a great price - value for your money!  So the overall verdict Waterfalls was good but not great.  I would like to see how their main dishes measured up to their tapas menu."}
{"text":"This place was so quiet, you wouldn't even know it was open!  I'm a big fan of tapas because I like small portions and variety.  We started with pakoras and also ordered some lamb, eggplant and shrimp.  All dishes were delicious and extremely filling.  As expected with Indian food, nothing was bland or dry.  The spice level was tolerable for my tastebuds, but not enough kick for my date.  The restaurant was nicely decorated and the service was good, but It was a little too quiet for comfort."}
{"text":"Out enjoying one of those perfect September afternoons with sun and warm weather we stumbled into this tapas bar in need of a light bite and in search of a decent patio (this one is fairly large).  The service was good. Friendly server and quick enough service.  We ordered a saucy chicken dish and rosemary naans. The chicken didn't arrive particularly hot (just warm) which surprised me a little but not a big deal. It was pretty tasty. The rosemary naans were just normal naans with dried rosemary sprinkled on top. Kind of meh.  The beer list was good, not your typical big brand products, and arrived fairly quickly and cold.  My one big complaint was the wasp problem. We spent our entire meal swatting them away from our meals. Is this the restaurant's fault? Debatable. I'd say yes only because there were dirty dishes at abandoned tables lying all over the patio. In other words lots to attract and feed those pesky wasps.  Anyway, pretty average place. The Market Place is right across the street and has much better reviews so it's probably worth going there instead."}
{"text":"We've been there at least twice.  Good food, good service.  The seafood and naan were great!"}
{"text":"This place is superfluous. Just don't go there."}
{"text":"I've recently started coming to this establishment, due to the fact that 2 of my other favourite Indian restaurants in the east end closed down, but this is my new go to spot for my favourites butter chicken and saag paneer!! Both always come out fresh, hot and delicious!! ;)  At times the atmosphere can be quiet and not too exciting, but it's nice for a chill dinner with friends! And if you're lucky they will have a promo on groupon! ;)   The staff always seem friendly"}
{"text":"I had (1)  sangria here one hot afternoon and it gave me the WORST headache for more than a day. yuck"}
{"text":"Wow, there's a lot of poor reviews for this place.  I was here on Friday night and the service was quite good.  Food was alright.   Jazz band felt weird at an Indian restaurant, but I can't really complain.  The place was quite empty which might account for why none of the service problems others mention occurred."}
{"text":"Across the street from where I work. Call in and order and pick it up 15 minutes later! Awesome! Tasty food. Some prices seem a little over priced on some items but very reasonable for other items. The staff are nice and the environment is very relaxing."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and it was great!  They have a lunch special: $9.99 for vegetarian options and more for meat, but so many choices served with naan.  We were the only patrons aside from someone at the bar - granted, it was 3:30pm.  My boyfriend ordered the butter chicken and I had a veggie item: spinach and cheese.  Both were piping hot when they came out and the naan was delicious.    Our server was very attentive - I thought it was a cool, little place.  I have one complaint and that is, where's the kick?  The spices were definitely lacking.  I don't want to be crying by the end of the meal, but a little nose running is always a good sign at an Indian restaurant in my opinion. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In a previous review of an Indian restaurant I've enjoyed I mentioned that there was not a single none South Asian person to be seen (granted that place was in Brampton, but still!), the exact opposite can be said of my time here at Waterfalls (except for the last 10minutes when I did see a group of 4 Indians wander in).   Waterfalls looks very inviting from the outside and that's the main reason my friend (Susan G) bought a groupon for it. Walking in, at first glance it looks pretty nice inside but upon seating ourselves at a table of our fancy as our friendly waitress suggested the interior does look rather tacky. The white table cloth (underneath the glass exterior of our table) had more than a  few stains. There was live music which was not bad, albeit a little loud and random song selection, but the stage, lighting and backdrop just didn't seem to go together, there were still Christmas lights put up but not switched on alongside dollarstore looking Valentine's Day deco.  The menu presentation was possibly one of the worst I've seen, a few pages of a simple Word Document file printout in a file cover where the extra file pages in the back were not removed but instead had white or black paper filling them. But apart from that, they did seem to have a good list of food to choose from.  We got the chicken chettinad, okra and potatos along with roti and cheese naan. I would have given this 3 stars if I did find the food to be tasty, but I didn't. I found it to be quite bland but at least the serving sizes where big.  Waterfalls gets 2 stars for it's friendly staff and the fact that they have the Flying Monkey on tap!"}
{"text":"You're either a Pedestrian(Sunday) or a Dine-in customer, those are the two options that the kind & patient waiter would notify you as you choose to take a seat inside. A group of 4 decided to take a seat as 1 of them got an order from the street food side of Waterfalls, shortly after they were notified and went on their way.   Most other customers were at the patio simply enjoying a PINT or two with a friend while there was a convenience Jazz group doing their Pedestrian Sunday routine. Other than that, not much meal diners enjoying the Indian romantic decor indoors.   We stayed on the side of Tapas and the Curry Deals that make it easier for sharing, which usually means I end up cleaning the plates which suits me just fine.  2.5 *Star*  Non-Vegetarian Combo Platter(Fried Calamari, Chicken Tikka, and Shrimp Tikka, $12.00) was a starter made for 2 as you'll find 2 Jumbo Shrimps. The Chicken and Shrimp needed the accompanied Coriander Mint Sauce & Tamarind Sauce for added flavour.   Waterfalls Special Tapas(Pan Seared Jumbo Shrimps, Scallop and Smoked Salmon, $12.00) had the same portion size bites as the platter. Don't think of it as an Indian dish just so you don't order it expecting so. It's A-OK, it taste like how it reads on paper.   Waterfall Special Curry Deal(Choice, $18.00), one of the pricier items on the Menu. I didn't think the portion size would satisfy an average guy as I had to face-off with my direct competition in front of me. The limited Meat chunks in the bowls make it a bit hard to justify this price."}
{"text":"Ate at Waterfalls last night, the restaurant was reasonably busy, but not crazy.  Live music was a nice touch, tho in the cavernous space it did add to the overall noise level a lot.   The food was tasty and the app's arrived quickly, but the gap between the apps and the entres was far too long.  When the food finally arrived, some was piping hot (good) and some was nearly cold (bad), and part of it (the rice) didn't arrive for 10-15 minutes after the rest of the food (really not good).  While we generally enjoyed Waterfalls, the cost and poor service (i.e. delays and food temp) would probably stop us from returning for anything but a quick snack.  You can do much better for your dollar at many Indian restaurants around the city.  (For what we spent, we could rent a car, drive to Brampton, go to Brars and return - just sayin)."}
{"text":"Overall, I was pleased with the food and service. I think the understaff problem mentioned in other reviews wasn't an issue because there were not a lot of customers at that time.  My friend and I shared naan, mango chutney, tofu tikka masala, a chicken tandoori appetizer; they were very good. On the other hand, we ordered a pitcher of sangria, but I wasn't pleased at all. For $32, we got a watery pitcher, with hardly any fruit (probably 5 - 10% of the pitcher) and most of it was lime and lemon skin (so you couldn't eat it either).  I would go back for the food, although for a bit less money, you could get the same quality in other places."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I had a nice experience at this place. I probably wouldn't have gone if I had read the reviews but I'm happy that I did.  My wife calls it \"the classiest place in Kensington\".  This is a rare combo: an indian restaurant that makes a nice Mojito and has live music.  We'd been tempted by this place for a while now but we finally took the plunge today. I had the Cuban Mojito ($9), one of the better ones that I've had.  For dinner, we had the vegetable pakoras ($8) and the curry special ($18) and it was more than enough for two.  The service was pleasant, not terrible.  The live jazz was quite nice. The food was average but good for vegetarians.  It gets extra points for having an awesome patio on a good part of Augusta.  This would be a great place for a drink and a snack on a hot day.  Overall, a little pricey but not a bad choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is weird. It's an Indian restaurant but the decor isn't Indian and you can tell that this used to be some kind of bar (as the most prominent things in the restaurant is a old wooden bar and a stage). It's definitely a weird ambiance. They also rent out the restaurant to reggae performers after 10pm... so if you go to eat late be prepared to hear a bunch of reggae artists setting up and doing soundchecks on their drums/guitars.   The food was really good though, the vegetarian combo platter is good and so was their lamb vindaloo. Their naan while not the best I've had was very good. Their pappadums were kind of weird and rolled up. I feel its kind of bad that their curry dishes don't come with rice and you have to add in a side of rice, most good Indian restaurants automatically give you rice. If I was in the mood for Indian, I'd do takeout from here.  The service was bad just like the other reviews said. Even though it was a quiet night, the two girls working just weren't attentive to their customers. I had to get up and get my server. They seem to always be busy behind the bar but what are they doing?  Anyway this place is okay but I'd probably go elsewhere for a restaurant dining experience. I would definitely recommend them for takeout however or a Groupon."}
{"text":"Food was good. A nice variety. Cross a pub and an Indian Restaurant and this is what you get.... Good food with a pint and some hip music.... Service was snails pace...."}
{"text":"The \"tapas\" name is deceiving, because they're just really Indian appetizers that you'd find anywhere, but the food at Waterfalls is pretty decent and apparently they have good drink specials too, which only really makes sense considering they have a nice big patio in Kensington Market and it's an effective way to get people to have a seat, have a drink, and hey, then maybe those apps/tapas will sound good too.  I had the \"famous\" butter chicken which was quite tasty (and they allowed me to order the lunch special after hours, not bad), my wife had a chicken tikka sandwich. Both of us were quite happy, though as I recall it was the fries that she liked more than anything else, which seems almost strange.  The service was a little slow given that it was not a busy day, that's the only drag on the rating, but that's really the only knock I could give it. Overall, I was quite happy."}
{"text":"Went tonight for a friend's birthday. The reservation was for 15, but only 9 of us showed up, which I'm thankful for otherwise I'd probably still be waiting for my food. We arrived at 7:15 and were not offered drinks for half an hour. The drinks themselves took another half hour to show up. Once they finally did we placed our order and realized we may be in for a long night. The server was really nice, but the place was severely understaffed for a Saturday night: 2 servers, 2 cooks and a full restaurant.  Two hours after I sat down was when I had my first bite of my samosa appetizer, which was delicious. It would be another 45 minutes before our meals would be on the table. Half of our party was finished eating before a couple of friends received their food. No apologies, no offers, no recognition of how ridiculously long everything was taking. Many tables that arrived after us received their meals et al before us.  The food was fantastic, which is why I'm giving 2 stars and not 1. The music was cringe-worthy, a catatonic elevator-music band that soullessly covered greats like Hallelujah, I Will Survive and What a Wonderful World. Music that would have complemented the environment would have been more appropriate. After that band a group of people started setting up for a PLAY... Our party marveled at the silence and flickering lights as the actors started constructing their set. Eventually we just couldn't stop laughing; from bad music to no music and faulty electricity,  plus a now 3 hour restaurant experience, and we were all colossally late for the second location of this birthday party (which other people were going to be at who were not joining us for dinner). After the birthday girl finished her meal, she threw down some cash and left to hold the fort down at the tiki bar. NOT the way for a birthday girl to feel.  The bill organizing was a debacle. We tried to organize a split bill system with our server at the beginning, who told us we'd just sort it all out later. As someone who worked in the industry for years, that is a very bad idea. I figured out my total plus tax and tip and gave my cash before other people were even given their bill.   The restaurant's grand apologetic gesture came in the form of comp-ing about 6 orders of naan bread, a total of $12. For a group of people ordering multiple drinks and bottles of wine, plus a full meal each, that was pretty measly.  I don't blame the server at all, he was a nice fellow who was working really hard (about 40x harder than anyone else there). The owner really needs to re-evaluate scheduling and have at least two more servers on the floor, a bartender, and three more people in the kitchen in order for the restaurant to run smoothly. I watched people leave after not being acknowledged at the door for over 5 minutes, and a table sat dirty for over an hour before being cleared.  Go to this place... Just not when more than 3 people are in there!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by saying that I am generally an optimistic, non-fussy diner. I have worked in the service industry and also have many good friends who have as well.  Now that that is out of the way, i have to say that this was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had. I arrived at 7 for dinner. it wasn't too packed, the server brought me my menu within 15minutes and things looked okay, although there wasn't a whole lot of selection.  We ordered and our pitcher of sangria came relatively quickly. An hour and a half later, our appetizers arrived. I was starving and the chicken tikka masala was cold. 45 minutes later, our plates still hadn't been cleared and we asked if our mains were coming. The server mumbled something about how he would check. Then he came back and said that the kitchen was \"chopping fresh vegetables for the meals\" and that was why it had taken almost two hours to come. Then our food finally came and my paneer was beyond bland. After 2 and a half hours, our server asked us for the first time how our food was, and I can't say that I gave a glowing review.  Overall, the food wasn't tasty, dinner (appetizer and main) took three hours, my appetizer was cold, our server didn't try to make things better after they had clearly forgotten about our order (even though it wasn't that busy) and the bathrooms were kinda gross. If I could have given this no stars, I would have."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The decor was nice. Service was very slow (I think they are significantly understaffed). Would go there if I was really craving Indian food."}
{"text":"I dined here last night with my friend, with no expectations we thought we would try something different than our usual Indian restaurant. We purchased a voucher from Living Social worth 50$ so when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the restaurant had a fair amount of people.  We ordered the non-vegetarian platter as an appetizer, the curry special which consisted of chicken chettinad and beef kadhai and the mushroom makini. It took 40 minutes for us to receive the appetizer. We both thought the appetizer was average but nothing relatively special. We received our meals at 9PM, one hour after our arrival. The curry dish my friend ordered was warm but not fresh, the mushroom makini was fresh but the flavour was too much like I was eating butter. I ate about 1/4 of the mushroom makini because the butter taste was overwhelming.  The service was below average, we had ordered water and when we wanted more there was no one to ask. Upon arrival the table clothes were dirty and the next table was not cleaned. I noticed there were only 2 chefs in the kitchen, 2 waiters and a manager on a Friday evening.  When we received our bill, usually when we have a voucher worth 50$ and we did not spend our maximum we would not need to pay tip or the taxes. But in this situation the waiter told us we had to and it was not included with the voucher. So I had to pay the taxes when the voucher would have covered the overall amount, this has never occurred to me as I have used vouchers in the past and if I have not used over the amount given it would be counted as tip. SO I gave the waiter 10$ and on top of that the remainder of the voucher which is 8$ equals 18$ tip which is completely ridiculous for the service we received. I was overall disappointed in this experience, I would never go back to this place again. I cannot explain the disappointment but we learned not to go back to this place for Indian food."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how terrible the ratings are for this place.  I'm glad I didn't see them until after I visited because my experience was much much better than most of these reviews.  Stopped in on a freakishly sunny weekday afternoon in October and sat on the patio.  There were probably only 4 other full tables at the restaurant since it was around 3pm. This is definitely a great place to enjoy when the sun is out because the patio is quite large.    Orded a round of Mango Daquiri's and split the Grilled Masala Prawns, the Grilled Masala Squid, and an order of naan.  Service was prompt - my drink came out in about 5 minutes, food about 10 minutes after that.  Drink was delicious and fruity. Food was flavourful, with a good mix of spices and the seafood tasted fresh.  Both dishes were served on a bed of greens with grilled vegetables, which were also great.  There was not a morsel left on either plate when we were done!  Naan was also good, and came out piping hot.    Including tax and tip our food and drinks came to $20 per person, which was totally reasonable given the quality. I will be back the next tim I'm in the area."}
{"text":"4 stars for the drinks, 3 stars for the food.  We were lured in by the $6 mojito deal on Fridays - they have a pretty extensive mojito menu, which includes other rum drinks as well (like pina coladas, etc). They're really good and pack quite a punch - the menu says that they are 2oz drinks; they come in a pretty tall collins glass and are quite pretty to look at with the mint and the fruit juices.  The actual food is pretty hit or miss. We were really confused about the \"tapas bar\" concept - this is really not a tapas bar. There is nothing on the menu that we could find that we would even remotely classify as tapas. In terms of food, it's a pretty straight up mediocre Indian place - good portions, but not really worth the price."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant as I did enjoy my food but the service wasn't entirely up to par.  I ordered the butter chicken which at the time honestly did taste more like an italian, rose style sauce with chicken so because this place was supposed to specialize in Indian Cuisine I was a little confused. Also the dishes are not served with rice, this offers more of a selection I suppose but it is also a little silly when every meal *requires* you purchase rice seperately.  The portions I do feel are large but the food I found was delicious, even if it wasn't the most authentic I did enjoy the meal very much.   Service wise I was not impressed though, besides that warm and lovely greeting from the host or possible owner, the waitress was not attentive and left us waiting for long periods of time. Another downside to almsot anywhere in Toronto it seems now is parking, the street parking only goes to 8:30 or 9pm I believe so while we were waiting for our server parking enforcment could have shown up at anytime which would have forced us to run over and intervine. Not something you want to be worrying about when your trying to enjoy your dining experience.  Large enough patio was fairly comfortable but there weren't many people when I was there so I wonder how comfortable it would be packed.  Overall though I would say it's a decent place to experience what I would call an Indian \"Inspired\" meal but make sure you have the time to spend waiting for service"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to get a drink for lunch and it was beautiful weather at the end of the summer.    We got there at 12:25 and asked the waitress if we could just have one drink and she motioned us to a table.  This place gets one star because there are lots of seats to sit down in and took our order.    The reason why I'm giving it no further stars is because we waited 40 minutes for one drink and in the process, the waitress seated another group, took their order and served their drinks first.    We didn't even get our drinks and when we got up to leave the waitress told us to stay because it takes a while to make a margarita.  But it shoudln't take 40 minutes to make one!  I've never tried the food here, but the service alone... simply terrible. :("}
{"text":"The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.  Awesome Indian food outside of little India or India in a clean environment and I have eaten my share of the stuff so I am quite the expert here.  Great decor, good wine and sangria, OK cocktails but the food is good value for the money. Service is always SUPER SLOW. So come when you have time. The biryani here is one of the best.  I have had the chicken and the vegetable biryani both are very tasty with good portions.  The platters are also pretty good  They sangria while good is a little pricey. 20-30% over other places, so this is a place Ill order the wine and the cocktail specials."}
{"text":"food was good. Service was slow. Just keep an eye on your waiter to see if he/she is getting what u asked for."}
{"text":"On a hot Victoria Day Monday, Waterfalls's patio was an enticing option. Upon walking in, it became clear pretty quickly that the restaurant was understaffed -- not sure if that's because of the holiday, but other reviews suggest it may be typical. It took a long to get the attention of either of the two servers, and eventually we just grabbed our own menus and plunked ourselves at a table the staff agreed upon that hadn't yet been cleaned up. Our server was, if nothing else, friendly though, and also accommodating to my companion's food allergies.  Once ordered, the food took a long time to arrive. (Perhaps the kitchen was also understaffed.) Our onion bhaji and chicken pakoras were tasty, but the bhaji were fried slightly too long and so had an edge of burnt taste.  The main course was a two-curry special which arrived with a generous portion of both rice and naan. I have to give them points for value here ($18 for more than enough food for two people), and the curries were tasty enough, if not terribly memorable. The Chicken Chettinad is a cashew-based dish, which seems somewhat unusual for the typical tikka-masala/butter-chicken menu one finds. The other curry we chose was a Baingan Bartha, which was...serviceable. The special also came with a portion of raita, a slightly soggy papadom, and a decent lime pickle.  I've had much worse Indian and spent more money on it, so I would consider coming back and trying to order some of the other less common dishes, like the special mango fish dish that wasn't available that night.  One last note: there was a pretty egregious band that played 3 (!) sets while were there, covering all the jazz/pop songs you've heard a million times before in a style you soon hope to forget. It's nice that a restaurant such as this employs local musicians, but if you're going to hire your cousins's daughter's band, at least limit them to 2 sets and turn the volume down so as not to disturb the diners."}
{"text":"1. Is Indian food supposed to be bland? Where was the spice? 2. Dirty (stains on the table) and cold 3. Dinner ensued with the stinkiest gas ever 4. Over-priced  Saving grace: Decent service"}
{"text":"Awkward would be the best way to describe my experience.  We walked in, stood around for a minute or two and we were told to sit wherever we wanted. After 5 or 6 minutes a waitress stopped by to ask if we were eating or just wanted a drink menu. We asked for a menu and she returned with two. We looked over everything and decided what we wanted.  When the waitress returned 10 minutes later(no drink order taken, no water brought to us), we inquired about what came with the main as it didn't specify rice. Turns out they \"don't include sides because people were complaining they didn't want them and they shouldn't have to pay for them\". I found it strange, as usually rice or naan is served with curry and for $14 it would be kind of strange for it to not.  The waitress didn't offer us the specials but it was approximately 8:35 by the time we had a waitress come take our order and that menu is only available until 8:30pm. You'd think having walked in at 8:15-8:20, we'd be able to order off that... but nope.  We might return and try the specials, but for a restaurant to be called \"Waterfalls\" and to only have 3/4 of 1 of the three \"Waterfalls\" at the front entrance working shows that management or the owner has given up."}
{"text":"Every time i have attended this amazing restaurant, it is always a hit.  My favorite; the butter chicken. So well seasoned with the right spices and the chicken is tender, and, of course, mouthwatering. Nor is that all. The garlic naan bread...is REAL, and addicting. Only one con though, and thats gonna' have to be the slow service. On aside from that, the overall performance was amazing,"}
{"text":"Food was good, but server need some training. He served a hot plate across the table and my friend wasn't able to hold the hot plate more than 2 seconds , so he dropped his plate on a side a bit...lucky enough not on his pants ... The heat for some reason doesn't work here, people were sitting in coats, server never informed, apologized or served a cup of tea ( what a perfect solution to make your customer to feel better in such a cold evening, even indoor) Don't feel like coming back..."}
{"text":"We came here with some out of town relatives because they wanted to tour the neighbourhood and eat Indian food. This restaurant is definitely not my first pick for Indian food.  The restaurant was large, oddly constructed and mostly empty (though the patio was full) on a Monday at lunch time. Service was slow but adequate. The food was fine, nothing to write home about (do people in India want me to write to them about Indian food in Toronto?).  Saw some homeless guy eat off plates that were left on the patio tables by diners who had left a few minutes prior.  Edible food, adequate service, probably a safe bet for Indian food in Kensington market."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quiet dinner for two at Waterfalls last night. At 19:00 we were the only ones in the place, so the service was probably more attentive than is typical. Has the look and feel of a high end Indian restaurant, but with surprisingly reasonable prices. Started with vegetable pakoras which were fantastic. Our entrees were lamb vindaloo, eggplant curry (bartha), and a shrimp dish. Not spicy enough for my tastes, but decent. What they lack in flavour Waterfalls makes up for in presentation.    Obligatory Title Pun: FALL in love with this classy option in Kensington.  Menu Readability: Divided cleanly into apps, entrees and desserts.    Need to mention: Next time I'll probably stick with the apps/tapas. Good way to get some variety and it was the highlight of the meal.  What this place teaches me about myself: Choosing a table is actually tough when there's no one else in the place."}
{"text":"I've come here for a dates and a few dinners with friends since I used to live in the market a couple years back.  The food is excellent. The butter chicken or lamb vidaloo are must-trys here. I've never seen Waterfalls packed, which means more attention on the service side, but probably not the type of place I'd go on a date again.   Once in a while they'll put on a live jazz band, which is pretty cool. On a summer's day make sure to sit on the patio, there's some good people watching I used to get done there from time to time."}
{"text":"The staff was not really the best one. It was quite long. But she was only. Fortunately the food was really good. The dish is pretty big. And the price really interesting for the lunch. I didn't try the all you can eat the week end.  Such a pity. But the chicken was prefect. The bread as we'll. I would like to try all the dishes on the menu..."}
