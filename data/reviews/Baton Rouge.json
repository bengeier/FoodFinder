{"text":"My usual lunch includes the lunch ribs, with fries and baked apples. After which I am so full, moving is difficult, but it is oh so good.  This visit I decided to try something different. I started with the Cream of Potato Soup, with cheese, chives and bacon. Nice thick soup, with a great taste. For main course I had the Baton Rouge Club, which is a chicken breast, bacon, tomato and lettuce on whole wheat bread, with fries. Again, a very filling meal and for about $20 including tax and tip, a very filing meal at a good price.  But being a special occasion (out with friends), we also had dessert. I had the Creme Brulee Cheesecake. I am a *HUGE* cheesecake fan, and this is one of the best. Covered in caramel and a nice thick consistency, I'll be ordering this dessert again."}
{"text":"Soup of the day (beef barley) was totally flavourless.  Had the Mediterranean burger which was decent, but a bit strong on goat cheese taste.  Overall, not bad.  Sweet potato fries was on point.  Has a nice looking patio, and the inside looks good but place is super dusty, could use a good dusting before customers come."}
{"text":"I went here on a date.   Felt welcome, good staff, romantic.  We didn't get an appetizer or dessert. We both got the steak with garlic mash. It comes with gravy on the side which I really like. Awesome steak, one of the best I've had. Cooked perfect. Nice and warm. Flavour was good. This was my second time going here, I'd return again."}
{"text":"I have had lots of prime rib from a lot of restaurants, and never  had to complain. This prime rib dinner that I had  in your restaurants was absolutely horrible, it was grey, pink inside,it looked like it was boiled, asked for med rare, this was medium.the meat was tough,lots of sinew running through it, could not finish it. I left 3/4  When the server came she asked if I wanted to take it home, I told her it was the toughest prime rib I ever had,was she sure it was prime rib. It was just a big hunk of grey meat with a huge amount of fat on one side.  she ignored me. The balance of the meal was okay. I travel with a group that lunches at various restaurants once a month, Yours would not be my choice."}
{"text":"For appetizer: got the soup of the day.  Beef Barley: it was a little bland, I'd add  Lil more salt & pepper, coriander, Lil lemon and garlic. I think that would've made it better. Also, side note: ask them NOT to serve with a serving spoon. No joke!  For main: I got the general tsao chicken salad. It'd b better if it had some kale and arugula. The general tsao chicken in the salad was very good.  Overall, It was pretty good. But the dusts on the seating area kind of made it unappetizing."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today, service was good and salads were excellent. I had the General Tao salad and my collègue the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Service was AWFUL. took twenty minutes to even get a glass with liquid in it. The man behind us left saying he was there for an hour and ten minutes and ended up leaving having only gotten a soda. Steak was over cooked and manager tried to argue saying it wasn't. Medium rare is not supposed to be BROWN. Told me the centre was red.. Shall I only eat the centre and cut off all the well done part? Only good thing was my appetizer (calamari) and wine of course. I was seat ONE (was told to put this as I'm writing). Will not return for SURE!! Spend a lot of money on restaurants. Really too bad it was this experience here. PS you'll need water. Salty. OKAY NOW.... been waiting for check for a while and the COOK comes out to argue with me about my steak being cooked properly. UNREAL!!!!!! If it was cooked right it would be in my STOMACH - not in a take out container. HORRIBLE customer relations. How embarrassing. Pathetic. I'm literally shaking I'm so mad now."}
{"text":"I like this location. Their steaks are very good. I like that their appetizer calamari are grilled, not fried. Servers are quick and very polite. You always can get what you were asking, or what you forgot to ask. At peak time (Friday night) the whole place is very noise as all people are talking and the whole area are pretty much open, so if you need to talk to your partner, you might need to talk very loud.   I am trying to follow the rule of not ordering seafood main courses in steakhouses and vice versa, so my only experience with their food are steaks and ribs. Both are excellent to my taste.  Definitely recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this location for years.  It has been our fall/winter go-to when we want a good steak dinner.  We had a horrible experience tonight.  Food quality and portions were disappointing. The steaks were thin, grisly  & overcooked.  I used to love the fresh veggies (carrots, cauliflower & broccoli), instead we got a few limp and oily pieces of pepper, and one piece of cauliflower.  The service was poor. Our server rushed us through our order, brought our food and she was no where to be seen until we finished our meal.   We didn't even get water.  The manager offered us a free appie card for our next visit and he took 15% off the bill.  It has really changed.  The place was dead.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have only been for lunch. Love their chicken tenders and the grilled veggies sandwich. Hope they never take these out of the menu. So yummy and dishes come with a mountain of fries. Lunch breaks on the patio are a nice treat."}
{"text":"Have had two visits to the Whitby location, the first was 12 months ago - very nice dinner. The second and last ever visit was in August 2010. The restaurant was filthy, tables not properly cleaned, utensils dirty, floor had not been cleaned for ages it seemed. There were flys crawling all around the window next to our booth. The food at this location was not nearly as good as 12 months ago and certainly not as good as the location in Markham. I will never go back to the Whitby location. Not sure what has gone wrong at this location but don't really care as I am never going back."}
{"text":"I tried the pork chops ...honestly it looked boiled and was bland with half a broccoli..like really! Service was good though."}
{"text":"love this place  i like the pork chop with the huge portion of french fries  so Delicious not as good as the old version that was on the menu a few years ago but still very good  service is always great, the decor is very masculine (wood and leather) stake house vibe  just very well done experience, if you cant get to a keg, visit this place its almost as good"}
{"text":"I really like the way this restaurant is designed. When you walk in you have about a 90% chance of getting a booth, which are about as comfortable as it gets. I have had the opportunity to eat at Baton Rouge a few times now and have always been impressed with the wait staff and menu selection. Once you receive your food it only gets better, everything is cooked to perfection.  Definitely check this restaurant out if you are in the area, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary and found the food very disappointing. Crab cakes were lukewarm and inconsistently seasoned. There were pieces of shell in the lobster risotto and the scallops and shrimp were overcooked and rubbery. Even the dessert was bad - all I could taste in the apple cobbler were pecans. No apples. We will not return. Should have gone to the Keg."}
{"text":"Food, service, ambience are alright.   Basically, this chain fills the niche between Jack Astor's and The Keg.  Did that niche need filling?   Discuss amongst yourselves...."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for the past 5 years or so~ the rib steak has always been my favorite here, but I can't help to notice it's getting smaller every year...it's just not as good as before, disappointed and after my last try few weeks ago I'll prob never visit again."}
{"text":"We happened to end up at North York branch for a birthday party. All staff were very rude and seemed to be very unhappy with their job. They sat us at a table for more than 15 minutes without one single staff seemed to care about us to even offer us a glass of water! When eventually someone passed by to serve another table, turned to us and asked:'' Do you want me to serve you''? we were like ''What?!'' Are you meant to serve our table or we had to beg for someone! No manager at sight or site(as said), and we left hungry and unserviced! Best place to go to ruin a birthday! And it was a weekday with no apparent congested line-up...! Terrible experience with customer care!"}
{"text":"I am (was) a frequent customer of Baton Rouge both for personal and business occasions. I have been going to your restaurant since the first GTA location opened in Woodbridge. Our office is on Yong St north of Finch in City of Toronto and at least 12 times in any year we have either dinner or lunch at your restaurant at 5000 Yonge St Last Wednesday (June 10th) my assistant made a reservation for 5. She specifically requested a table as 5 men sitting a booth for a business meeting is not ideal. When I arrived and requested my table the host became embarrassed and called the manager. After waiting at least 10 minutes the manager finally arrived. Stalled for another 2 minutes then told us there were no tables only booths. You can imagine that I was upset. My reservation clearly indicated a request for a table. If for some reason it was not available we should have been told when the reservation was made or if something occurred later (not sure what that could be) they had my phone number. The manager made no effort to appease us. We all left in our separate cars, paid for parking. To rub salt into the wound and as an indication of you customer satisfaction program I called your head office yesterday. I told the receptionist that I had a complaint and without a comment put me into voice mail. I left a message but not surprising , received no call back"}
{"text":"$$ for low quality food. really disappointed, never going back. i had steak, lobster poutine, and caesar cocktail."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but it took too long to come out, we then waited for the bill for more than 10 mins like they are cooking it back in the kitchen or Somthing !"}
{"text":"I know it's kinda ghetto for a guy my age, but I love the chicken tenders at Baton Rouge, so that's what I ordered today, along  with a glass of Beringer Cab Sauvignon from a bottle ordered by one of my colleagues.  The tenders were as always great, and the wine was a good choice.  Our server was very nice, and was eager to check on us which was great, but her shift ended at 130 so she brought the bill over and explained that hr shift was coming to an end but that we were more than welcome to stay.  Totally not her fault. For a place that gets office lunch traffic shifts should go a half hour longer to prevent this kind of awkwardness!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night - the restaurant was relatively empty, but the hostess still took a while to seat us.   Our server was very polite, but did not offer the usual introductions you get at other steak houses. We had to ask him what the special of the day was and what the soup of the day was. Their menu has not changed for years, and items to choose from are limited and pricier than Jack Astors or Moxies.   The portions here are enormous, which makes their prices reasonable. My 10oz. prime rib was definitely at least 12oz. and most of their entrees are served with a mountain of fries (or other sides you choose). My side of 'seasonal veggies' was overcooked, and the bell peppers were too soft and with no crunch to it. The prime rib itself was not a good cut - It's the type of cut that's too chewy and hard to swallow because of the ridiculous amount of tendon in it. Though the steak did come out perfect at medium rare, they need to improve on the quality of the steak itself.   Their chicken and ribs was A-OK. The ribs were tender and fell off the bones easily, but needed more sauce. The chicken breast wasn't too dry, and went very well with the BBQ sauce on the side.   Overall, Baton Rouge needs better quality control and hopefully revamp their menu in the near future."}
{"text":"Ridiculous and pathetic service.  Last Sunday, when the temperature was extremely hot (35 Degrees Celsius but felt like 40), my girlfriend and I were looking for a [hopefully] shaded patio in order to enjoy cocktails and perhaps some food.   We were in the North York area and every other restaurant with patio was packed, thanks to the World Cup. We noticed that this place was almost empty and decided to go.   So, we walk in and ask if we could be seated at the patio but the hostess denies us. I ask why, since the patio is half full (or half empty in this case lol), and she tells me that they're short staffed (*brilliant business strategy on the first weekend of the World Cup) and that they wouldn't be able to handle another table, but also that there's a long waiting list... so I look at the waiting list and there are no names! It's empty, so I ask her to put my name on the list and tell her we'll wait at the bar.   We get to bar and there's 1 other man seated and 2 other tables with 4 people each nearby. I greet the bartender...Blank stare from said bartender. Ok. I spend the next 15 minutes trying to get his attention lol, raising my hand, trying to make eye contact, saying sorry. He doesn't say a word. Just blank stares. Keep in mind that the inside of the restaurant was almost completely empty, maybe 5% capacity.  Perhaps the barman was angry because they were short staffed and he was the only one making drinks for everyone in the restaurant... but it really wasn't busy at all. He wasn't being bothered every minute, and he was taking his sweet time making simple drinks. We were not offered water nor did he ask to take an order from us.  A few more minutes later, the hostess came to see us, I figured \"great, we finally got a spot\" but she only came to ask if we were going to be waiting at the bar... lol! At that point, we were fed up, so we decided to go elsewhere.  0*"}
{"text":"So far all three times I have been here, it has been pretty good. Service is not too bad Food is average, nothing mind blowing. My most recent vist was during the evening and the special menu was in full swing...except the fact that it was almost completely out of every item I was looking to try..lol Oh well... I still think the original ones in Montreal are much better.  So, if your in the mood for some real wood smoked ribs.. give this place a shot. You can't turn your nose up at the fact that they atleast use real wood. Unlike the other places that  use smoke dust for flavouring. The wine selection isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, and it's been an overall bad experience almost every time. My most recent trip here was with my family. Not only did it take 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, they didn't get my order right, and some of our food wasn't even hot.  I've been to a couple other locations of Baton Rouge and the food has always been great. Stay away from this location..."}
{"text":"Alright so this is where I say, by fluke, that Alberta is actually better.   Baton Rouge hasn't changed much from the last time I had visited there almost 2 years ago.  I had been to location once and also visited the Woodbridge location.  The atmosphere is still the same with the red vinyl benches.  The wait staff was pretty prompt and not overly aggressive and persistent in returning to the table.  So that part made for a comfortable evening.  So first we shared their spinach artichoke dip, which was probably the best part of the night.  Very hot and tasty as it should.  Then again more than likely it was nuked.    So onto the orders.  I got the ribs with garlic mash, and the others got chicken casear and New Orleans salads and Cheeseburger and fries.  As Karl said, these salads were piled high. I took a bite of the burger my gf ordered and it was dry.  The fries were seasoned pretty well.  As for my ribs, they just plain sucked.  Dry with very little sauce and very little meat.  For sure these were the frozen kind.  Not like the Montana's ribs I get with plenty of meat on the bones.  So I was thoroughly disappointed with my dish.    I don't if what we ordered was worthwhile for a return when I visit/move back.  There are a plenty of bbq joints in the city that are worth going to than Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants to which I haven't any idea how I ended up in. Reading an overdue issue of Toronto Life with BBQ as their front page for the last week, I've been dreaming about swine all day & night. So, with all the recommendations from the magazine...yeah, see I don't know how I ended up here.  For anyone familiar with the area it is known that parking here is quite a bitch. Thirty minutes before the street parking becomes free, so the three dollars coughed up in front of the parking enforcement was simply bitter. Not the swine I was looking forward to. Upon entering the first of two set of doors, we were greeted by a sign to the side advertising free validated underground parking for all patrons. SON OF A.....  Cute Maitre'D, sat us immediately by the bar upon determining our age. This I didn't like, so when our waitress came for our orders, we ordered her to sit us in the restaurant area. I didn't end up liking the area either, it felt far too alike to the retirement home I volunteer at.  There was however this almost posh looking elevated section with better lighting, but it seemed to be occupied by a large family gathering. I can't imagine a restaurant that is \"kids friendly\" as the survey question here asks, but considering I saw a number of customers under the age of 4..I suppose this place would be just that. Mondays are ribs & chicken for twenty bucks, but I just ordered just the ribs. Chris got the Monday special, I had a feeling he'll be paying for it.  My appetizer was the deep fried calamari, which turned out to be the least greasy calamari I have ever had in Toronto. The sauce was exquisite. The shrimp cocktail was really just five prawns on shaved ice. Large, but dull. Ribs were mediocre, and instead of gravy for my mash, they only had peppercorn sauce. When I asked our waitress what peppercorn sauce was, she replied \"It's like a gravy\". Very informative.   The chicken breast that came with Chris' special was a piece of brick that could have been used as a sponge to wash your dishes. Yet, he finish the while thing. I think his feeling pressured since every time we go out to eat I make him look like a little girl with my superhuman portions.  I saw four service persons here, and they were all wearing different outfits..which all looked like uniforms. So when the blonde in the white shirt came to top up my water, I asked her what the deal was. She told me the girl wearing black was the hostess, the waitresses are in the collared shirt, and she wore whatever she liked because she was the manager. I managed to keep my eyes off of her perfect tits throughout the whole conversation.  This was my first time at Baton Rouge, and really it's just a Moxie's with less moxie. I'm really not impressed with this restaurant, and it just felt like I spent $106 to dine at a cafeteria.  Two Asian stereotypes wearing Ed Hardy shirts showed up with two girls towards the end of our dinner. I winked at one of the girls...unfortunately I was met with zero hostility. I thought these people were supposed to be gangster?"}
{"text":"Out of all the chain restaurants in the Yonge and Shep area, I have never tried Baton Rouge. I always walk by it though. I see the booths, the deep, dark decor reminiscint of a cigar room for proper men. So, of course I decide to try it with my boyfriend on one of the rainiest days ever!  I have to say though this review will be a bit skewed as I didn't eat any meat. I mean, going to a steak place and eating vegetables right? Or rather, eating a lobster sandwhich, fries, and shrimp cocktail. I know...I know...why would I try Baton Rouge and not the meat? Well for one, I just wanted to see the place. It is surprisingly huge. And the service was quite good. My boyfriend had already eaten and was really there to accompany me on my eating binge. He had coffee and the chicken tenders which were absolutely horrible. It didn't look like the tenders I was used to. And there was way more fried batter than meat. You can take a pass on those.  The lobster sandwhich was a joke. I was thinking big chunks in creamy mayo. Rather, I got specks of the crustacean hidden in a big leafy lettuce. Now you see how this review is a bit biased...  The only thing I enjoyed were my two glasses of the Wolf Blass, 9oz of course. I don't know what the heck I ordered but the total bill came out to be $100 and change including tax and tips for two people...but really for one, non-steak eater. I think I will just go walking on by."}
{"text":"So I went to Baton Rouge and had neither the steak or ribs. I assume I was asking for trouble? It was my first time at BRRB and atmosphere was very chill and welcoming.  I started with the potato soup. It was topped with cheese, bacon and scallions. It was pretty good but it was essentially a bowl of mashed potatoes.  For my main dish, I opted for the chicken tender platter based on some of the recommendations here. The portion was very generous but I was a little disappointed overall. On the plus side, these are hand battered (not breaded) but the batter to chicken ratio was a let down. I could barely find any meat under the layers of bland crispy batter. They provide two sauces (bbq and honey mustard) which helped give some flavor.   Overall, it was a great dining experience and the dark ambiance was impressive. I will definitely return but I think I'm going for the ribs next time!"}
{"text":"(Note: I've written to Baton Rouge customer service/marketing twice, and still not received a response from them. This tells you something.)  We came on Mother's Day, so yes, I understand that service can be slow, but still, service shouldn't simply be an afterthought.  1) To start, my husband ordered a special Baton Rouge old-fashioned, described on their cocktail menu as \"BR Smoked Old Fashioned\": \"J.P. Wiser's Deluxe with smoked hickory and Canadian maple syrups, finished with lemon slices and dashes of Angostura bitters, served with Hickory Sticks. $11\".  When the drink came, my husband remarked even before tasting it, \"That doesn't look like the description: no hickory sticks, no lemon.\" He tasted it and said \"No maple syrup flavour either. It's like they forgot all the little flavours promised on the menu.\" When the waitress came by, he explained that the drink was missing a lot from the menu description. She replied immediately, \"Oh, we don't make them anymore.\" Acceptable for a restaurant to change their menu, but if the waitress knew this, why not mention this to the customer *before* he orders an $11 drink, or *before* you plop the glass down on the table?  Here's the kicker: When my husband asked the server, \"Well, since I didn't get what I ordered, can I get a different drink?\" She replied, \"Oh, I can just get you some lemons.\" She came back with slices of lemons on a side plate, and voilà, that's \"exactly\" what he ordered, the $11 drink *just* as described on the menu.  2) As for my order, I asked for one of the specials on the Mother's Day menu: the New York strip loin with sautéed mushrooms--\"with mushrooms\" being the only option for the strip loin on the special menu. When the server came back, there were no mushrooms in sight. When I asked her, \"Wasn't this supposed to come with mushrooms?\" she asked, \"Oh, you want it with mushrooms?\"  Guess what? She came back with the mushrooms on a side plate. See a pattern here?  Besides these two incidents, both my husband and I ordered our strip loins \"medium\". His came with adequate pink, and mine came with tinges of brown. Wonder why?  After our experience at this Whitby location, our conclusion is that service is an afterthought, like lemons or mushrooms served on a side plate.  Dine here at the Whitby BR? Never again."}
{"text":"Their pasta linguine was horrible. The shrimp was smelling like it had been there for 2weeks!! We even asked the manager to smell it he couldn't. After complaining they did not deduct the price of the smelly pasta. We paid for it in full but never will i go there again!! Waitress service was good but food and manager TERRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"Bar staff were quick and friendly , itcwas a busy saturdaysovthevfood was slow"}
{"text":"Okay here it goes... We have been coming to Baton Rouge for several years now. Have never been disappointed.  Food and service has been great.  Until last weekend!! Took my husband out for his bday dinner. He got his usual. Prime rib dinner (medium rare). Except it wasn't medium rare, he got medium to medium well! And it wasnt very flavourful. Wasn't impressed, but wasn't going to complain. Now here's the kicker. You pay a lot for this dish far as I'm concerned. Plus you pay for your salad on the side. Now granted the Ceasar salad and baked potatoes are really good. But as far as your meat. It could be done to perfection like it always has in the past. So the other day my husband's mother took us out for his bday dinner to this tiny little restaurant in a small town just north of lakefield. We both had the prime rib dinner which comes with a roll, salad, soup, baked potato and veggies. The prime was the best prime rib we have ever had in a restaurant. It was done to perfection.  Very very tender. And everything else was included with your meal. For $8.00 dollars less you get more included with your meal. The prime rib at Baton Rouge does not even compare to this tiny little restaurant north of Lakefield. So that said we will not be going back to your restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse steakhouse I've ever been to. Should have just driven the extra half hour to go to the keg instead of this crappy place. I made reservations on Wednesday night for a group of 5 for Friday night and when I called to let them know that we were running 5 mins late they said \"we don't have any reservations made for you for today and we are fully booked we can't accommodate you\" I was livid at this point. I asked for a manager and the lady said \"there's no manager here right now I will call you back in a minute\" and hung up. She called back and said \"sorry, we found your reservation, your table is ready\" my reservation magically showed up out of nowhere apparently. Looking back at this point I shouldn't have went there and took my business elsewhere but my in laws really wanted to eat steak and that's the only place close to their house.  Once we got to restaurant at 7:30pm it was completely empty for a Friday night and I'm not surprised at that. The service here sucks! The food is bland everything was horrible! Our server Darwin was horrible, he took forever to come to our table to get our orders then once he arrived he took my husband and I drink order and then walked away without getting my in laws order. That was extremely rude. The food was horrible and they didn't have much selection. I will never ever come to this restaurant again even if I were offered a free meal. Such a disappointment and waste of $200. I highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of going to eat here to spend their money at the keg instead, it will be much more worth it."}
{"text":"Came here around 3pm on a Sunday and it was fairly empty.   Pros Service was quick  Has TV's on patio Lobster Poutine Appetizer ($10) was great for two people   Cons  Drinks didn't taste good, we had the Tropical Sangria $9 and James'son $8.  Pricey for what they offer."}
{"text":"I luuurv Baton Rouge. Maybe it's because I don't know where to find decent ribs in Vancouver. Maybe because the massive amount of fall-of-the-bone goodness can be yours for such a decent price. Maybe because the place is a great choice for both large and small groups. Definitely because the area is good and easily accessible by transit (important when you're not downtown and buses are sparse in the evening).  If you're looking for healthy, this may not be the way to go: the portions are big and the sides are greasy. But if you're looking for soft, juicy, meaty goodness in a restaurant where you can hear conversations that are spoken at a normal volume, this is an option for sure. It's great for a casual generic date night, or a get together with pork-loving friends. Not to say that they don't have any other food options on their menu - I've had the salmon before. But their sell has got to be those ribs.  Parking is a bit confusing - they have a sign out front that says they validate parking, but it doesn't indicate where the lot is. We circled around for a bit before finding the entrance (at the back of the building), and had to ask the guard by the ticket machine to be sure that this was actually the right spot. Some signage would be helpful, especially since it's a pay-first lot - no one wants to put money in unless they know for sure it's the right place and it'll get validated. Just some food for though, Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"The food is good as any location but the service each time I've gone here has been lacking. The servers aren't rude - they are trying, but it's almost like this location only hired servers who flunked their Smart Serve. You get service with a smile but it's like a terrified one where you know they are thinking they've made a mistake and are hoping the punishment is painless."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always had a good time. The service is good and the food and drinks are good.   Most recently we sat on the patio and that was fantastic. We went for late night drinks and it wasn't too busy. We were able to get a table right away and they let us sit outside until close. The waiter even said we could sit there after they closed if we walked out via the patio. That was really nice of them.   I recommend this restaurant for a nice low key meal or some drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"The steak was excellent. I ordered a medium rare teriyaki beef with swiss chard salad. My friend got the one with cranberry medium and with beets. It was on point. My salad was mediocre, my friend liked her beets and said \"well dressed but we should have went to jack astors instead\" It was a small portioned meal for such a main meal and high price.  We got a tiki mule thats supposed to have flame on it but it did not come with that.  It was not a busy restaurant at all. It was almost dead. The host was friendly but my server was not. It's not bad, I don't ask for an entertainer or anything but I guess the interior design fooled me into thinking it had excellent service."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday celebration and I'm happy that I did. We came last minute with a large group but they where still able to accommodate us. I ordered the goat cheese steak with mash potatoes and veggies and I must say I was very pleased. My steak was medium well and cooked perfectly, my sides where really good too. My husband got the cowboy ribeye and lobster tail and was very satisfied with it , says it was a very well rounded meal. The service was great , I would definitely come back here for another occasion."}
{"text":"Was here on Oct31st Server was Miranda, quick efficient and nice service better than the previous times where the service was close to non-existent if you were non-caucasian at this location. Seems like they had a staff overhaul because this time the food was cooked properly and it was actually tasty. Had the following Calamari -Not too greasy, could be a bit crispier but thoroughly enjoyed it with the Cajun dip  Tortilla and Dip -Tasty and refills of tortillas was offered by our server  Ribs with Fries n Beans -Ribs were prepared quite good, fall off the bone, not too fatty, not too much muscle fibers, sauce was good, fries were crispy, bans were not mush, definitely recommended  NY and Top Sirloin Steak was cooked proper to medium rare, for the price it had a decent depth of flavor, salad that came with it was pretty standard, veggies were cooked well, mashed potatoes was good, first time having the Peppercorn sauce not taste like burnt chocolate, bravo to the new kitchen staff  Probably will come back but I'll probably request Miranda as my server as there's been too many servers that take their job for granted at this location.  ***note they don't validate parking anymore  2apps 3 entrees Above average gratuity Around $150 for 3 happy and full people  Will come back to this location if I'm having a craving for tender ribs"}
{"text":"I had lobster sandwiches it was alright nothing over the top, the fries were a little saggy, I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday, so we already had a somewhat fixed menu (you could choose between 2 or 3 options for the entree). This location is close to North York Station, right beside Mel Lastman Square. Parking is tough - you'll either have to pay to park in a garage or try to find some street parking. This was my first time coming to this location, and it's pretty similar to their other locations in terms of service and decor. Lighting is quite dark to make for a more intimate atmosphere, and thankfully it's not too loud inside.  I had the cesar salad as an appetizer and a vegetarian linguine. Food was quite tasty and I really enjoyed it considering my favourite thing to order from Baton Rouge is their chipotle chicken sandwich. Service was great! We stayed way past closing (almost midnight) and they didn't even try to give our table the bill - I guess because we kept ordering bottles of wine.  Overall, Baton Rouge provides a more upscale and intimate dining experience (compared to Jack Astors/Moxies/Joey's), but at almost the same prices. Service has never been bad and food is consistent."}
{"text":"Tried this location instead of the original fav; Downtown- eaton centre location and it was great.  The waiter was very nice and the food was very similar unlike the scarborough location.  It seems like the reviews are not great here but a 3.5 star from me.  Food/Service: 3/5, the batter on the chicken fingers weren't the best but they had a wedding party and it shouldn't be but that was the excuse.  Nevertheless, they offered another dish but i declined and appreciated the offer at least.  Ambience: 3/5, more of an Asian feel of decor; perhaps because it's in North York  Price: 3/5, fair and great service deserved a big tip."}
{"text":"The worst service. Over cooked steak. Better quality food in the area. I can't see how this place lasted this long."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the others however I enjoy their ribs too much to give a poor review. I find their ribs fall off the bone much easier than anywhere else and the sauce is quality. I also like the seasoning on the fries although it is a bit salty and the rice is okay. Service was slow on a non-busy weeknight. Would go again but prefer other locations."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Before I write this review, I would like to mention I am a red seal chef. Anyways I Order a steak, medium rare, with three other at my table.. Once the food came out I knew that the steak was more or a rare just by looking at it.. I was disappointed and ask the waiter Brandon if he could get me another one, or cook it more. He was very ice about it, and went to the kitchen to fix the problem. Once he came back with a new plant, just by looking at it again I knew it was not medium rare.. So that was two pieces of $20 slices of meat gone to the trash.. You would think the cook that is working grill would have payed close attention to the next order and cook longer.. But no still very rare..  Watch out when you order steak!! Seems like they do not know what their doing."}
{"text":"So many interesting items on the menu, and I keep going back to the ribs.  Tender, fall off the bone, I just pull of the meat and eat them with a fork. Might not be the authentic way to eat ribs, but it's not as messy.  I always default to the same thing:  ribs, with fries and beans.  The beans are rich and sweet, and the fries are one of my favourites--thin cut, perfect texture, and sprinkled with a touch of seasoning salt.  Reminds me of Webers Burgers.  I also had a chance to taste the Chicken Tenders.  Pretty amazing batter that fries up crisp and nearly melts in your mouth.  Too bad they weren't smoked and covered with barbecue sauce, or I might switch!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on Sunday. We weren't sure the place was open at first because nobody was around when we walked in but within a few minutes we were seated and attended to by out waiter.   Three of the four of us ordered the Prime Rib sandwich and the potato soup.   Two of us opted for the side of cinnamon apples and one went with the sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo.   As the menu describes, the sandwich came with sliced prime rib, Monterey Jack cheese, caramelized onions, horseradish aioli, toasted hoagie bun and a side of au jus. Believe me, there was a ton of meat on this sandwich! A hearty meal for sure!  The au jus was great for dipping but the horseradish aioli... oh my! Absolutely delicious! I thought this sandwich was great and I would definitely order it again. The cinnamon apples in the other hand were somewhat of a disappointment. Sadly, they were a little dry. The sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo was the winning side.   The potato soup was rich and thick but the serving size was such that I could have just had that and a salad and been fine! Good though.   Service was pleasant and efficient and overall we had a very enjoyable meal. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go to.  Good food, service, atmosphere, and reasonably priced given it's a steak house."}
{"text":"Excellent service and ultra comfy red leather booths to kick back in. I love the layout of this location, with the sleek bar area partially divided to the right and a very spacious and softly lit dining area. There are also more booths in the upper level that are slightly closed off by beautiful drapes, and it all makes for a very warm, inviting and cozy ambiance. It's a location well suited to daytime business meetings, dates and catching up with old friends...kids, not so much. I came for an early dinner so I'd like to come back and see how the bar is on the evenings.   The menu offerings are excellent with a great variety including daily specials and a lengthy cocktail, wine and dessert list (woo hoo!). I recommend the grilled calamari with capers, olives and lemon which is an off menu item and the ahi Tuna salad. I was a little overzealous (i.e. STARVING!) and ordered the top sirloin medium rare as a salad extra for about $8 - my breakfast for the next day and so worth it! I also tested the ribs and they are truly fantastic - and addictive, so guard them with your life before your SO demolishes them (sorry!)! Chocolate mousse comes in quite a generous size and the trio of creme brûlée is a nice treat to share.  So, long story short, 'twas a feast worthy of King's :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Baton Rouge before. After an unappetizing first trip I gave it a try and had a good run before this last visit. My wife ordered her steak medium and it came rare. I ordered mine rare (Pittsburgh) and it came well done and fatty. We sent both steaks back. My steak came back not rare but blue--they might as well have walked a cow out from the kitchen and lit a Bic under its belly. I ate it anyway because my kids were starting to bounce out of their seats. The service was good, but the food just didn't match up. The kids meals are HUGE, enough for two kids, at $10 per.  The children's hamburger is adult-sized. They'd be better off having much smaller meals at $5. I'll go back but for the bar only and I won't bring my kids."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet.   The seafood pasta is a great choice Service was lovely, our waitress the last time i was was there was lovely."}
{"text":"Menu prices look high but you get a pile of food. The name itself is a bit deceptive for those who might think this serves up food tending towards more authentic Louisiana/gulf coast type cuisine. Outback:Australia::Baton Rouge:Louisiana. At least Baton Rouge doesn't try to Outback it up with really dork ass names only the very drunk among us would consider authentic. No dorky menu names like Picklin' Parish Burger topped with Bayou Dressing and served with a side of Levee fries, Popcorn Shrimp Po'boy, or a Paul Prudhomme Pizza with Blackened Katrina Catfish.  You won't find creole jambalaya, étouffée, gumbo, or someone in the backyard with a garbage can doing up a crawfish boil right (http://www.tulane.edu/~aichesrc/images/Crawfish.JPG).  The North York location is a prime pre-Jersey Boys dinning location so don't attempt to dine here 6-7:30 pm without a reservation. Service is quick, efficient, and amazingly polite the three times I've been here.   Over all I'd give the food a neutral Cha-Ka (http://static2.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/GdMtUPz_AkYaAXBHOuj_Ag/l) but service, portion sizes, the chain's avoidance of Outbacking it up for yucks with dumb menu names, and for a varied group with varied tastes this will least offend, that brings the experience up to a shaka zulu (http://static4.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/xEteN-dt9mpHha1Fyq1U6w/l)."}
{"text":"I went here last night and as soon as we walked in the hostess said \"we close at 10\" well that's nice since it is only 9 ...  The restaurant only had a few tables at the time and the staff weren't doing anything, just socializing with each other...  We waited and waited after 10 minutes of not being offered a water we decided to leave, that's when the waitress finally decided to come and she asked us \" are you guys okay\" as we were leaving.  When we left we told the hostess \" I guess you are already closed\"  Overall I find this place overpriced and it's just okay, not amazing but not bad for the most part...  I won't be going back for a long time"}
{"text":"Summer time at Baton Rouge means two things: the ever reliable ribs (great sauce and slow cook) and the summer focus on lobster  (we had the lobster sandwich, which was better than expected and definitely comparable to the ones at some seafood-focused restaurants). Kudos to Amanda as well for the wonderful service.  One \"tip\": We've been to Baton Rouge for both lunch and dinner, and the ribs always seems to taste better during dinner. Could be a coincidence, or could be a better cook during the dinner shift :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my wife and older daughter tonight.  The waiters were unbelievably friendly and personable. They were down to Earth and truly committed to our entire satisfaction.  One waiter brought me a secret stash of hot sauce for my ribs! Then he shared his love for Jamaica with my wife who's going to Jamaica this coming Monday. More importantly, my wife loved the salmon salad that had a huge piece of salmon sitting atop the salad.  Dima was charming and affable as we shared views on world politics and local customs on enjoying libations...  Without a doubt our dinner was of the highest of quality. Our waiters made it that much better with their keen interest to our enjoyment of every aspect of the dining experience.  Our daughter was thoroughly satisfied with her chicken tender platter and apple crispy a la mode dessert, which I forcibly shared with her.  Best evening ever at this location.  Definitely will go back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Not so impressed. Food is overpriced for what you get and they seem to have an identity crisis - what kind of restaurant is this place? Too casual for a higher-end steakhouse & not enough variety to appeal to the masses. I ordered the blackened salmon - it was dull & flavorless. My colleague ordered crab cakes and said they were just \"ok.\" The big thing that turned us off? Our hotel room keys featured an ad for a free appetizer, which is why we thought we'd try the place. But alas, they don't honor those offers anymore at Baton Rouge. Wouldn't even throw us a bone. They must be bombarded by hotel room key coupons. There are SO many other great restaurants in the vicinity that you don't need to sacrifice for Baton Rouge."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers. They were not busy at all for a weekday lunch. The menu itself is pretty decent, lots of choices standard fare like burgers, steak frites, sandwiches.... prices were really good too. I had the steak frite with fries. Fries was delicious and so was the steak cooked medium rare.  It was not amazing steak but it was pretty tender and good value for the price. However, off their lunch specials menu, my coworker got the filet mignon and that was another story. It came out super tiny, over cooked, and 12$ more than the lunch special steak. My other coworkers had the burgers off the lunch specials and all the dishes looked great and were all under $20 and very tasty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there as I was given a gift certificate for Christmas. I would have been downtown but both the Eaton Centre and Front street locations closed. So we decided to use the voucher ASAP before there's more closures.   It was both our first experience. We arrived at around 10pm, the dinning room was quite empty and we were seated promptly.   Our waiter was nice and took time to explain the menu. We elected to share a plate of fried calamari and 2 prime rib steaks with a side of their ribs, as apparently they were famous for it.   The calamari was a very, very sad dish. The batter was soggy and the calamari was kind of soft, as if overcooked in too much oil.   The steaks were nothing to write home about. Cooking was done as requested (rare). The french fries were forgettable and the veggies also seemed like they were overcooked in oil.   Our waiter only came once and both our glasses of water were never replenished.  It took them well over 15 minutes to process the gift cards. We were getting wary to leave by then.   The decor is somewhat dated and the equipment, furnishings and menus are not very well maintained.   I am happy we had the gift card to pay for the dinner as I would have been more upset to spend my own money on this meal."}
{"text":"The servers were fantastic, excellent customer service.  They checked on us frequently and came to clear our plates.    They had really large portions and the food was great.  We stayed late and they didn't say anything.  The server even offered us free drinks because he felt that he didn't check up on us enough.  We declined, but it was a very nice gesture nevertheless."}
{"text":"Went for Christmas Eve dinner. Made the reservation 1 month earlier. I called and confirmed. Upon arival hostesses seemed confused when I stated my name. At first they told me thay my 2 friends were already waiting.. I replied I did not know them. They then stuck us on the bar area. Waitress was nice. Ordered chicken santa fe with wild rice. Order took more than 30min. When asked why it was taking so long waitress stated that diners get served faster as they made reservations. I informed her I did too. She seemed shocked and checked on the food. Food came out.. chicken dry ..but edible.. hubbys veggies were raw and my wild rice was hard as a rock. I asked for a bake potato intead. Waitress came out apologetic explaining they ran out. Got the mashed potatoes.. pretty good. Dessert. We ordered 4 apple pies .. hubby ordred cheese cake..his came out 10 -15min later. Waitress was helpful though.  Will never go back. Overpriced.. normally a mgr would come out for this stuff.. not 1 in sight."}
{"text":"We had a impromptu family dinner with our almost two-year-old daughter. We sat in the bar side in the booth because of the TVs and we really like the bartender Thi. My husband got to watch the raptors game and my daughter enjoyed the chicken finger kids meal that was $10 that came with the drink and a dessert! I enjoyed a nice glass of wine and it was such a peaceful and calm atmosphere for a family dinner. I don't know why we don't this more often! The service from Thi was so great, she really knew how to make us feel special.  The food came out hot and fast! We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ten of us had supper at Baton Rouge tonight.  I ordered the BBQ pork back ribs (10oz) with fries and warm apples.  It was good!  Our servers were Patrick and Rachel and they took good care of us."}
{"text":"We went to Baton Rouge for Saturday dinner. The restaurant was nicely decorated and the service was very friendly.  I wasn't hungry so I ordered the lobster sandwich. It came with fries. The sandwich was okay, not much flavour. The french fries was over seasoned. My friend was happy with her dish. We ordered the trio creme brulee for desert. It was very good.  The food was okay for me, but I give the restaurant three stars because the service was great. I forgot the waiter name, but he went out of his way to make everybody comfortable."}
{"text":"My partner and I go here pretty often. During our last visit this past weekend, we found out that they've updated their menu prior to our last run... some things are bit pricier, a number items were removed, and a bunch of new items have been added. We were excited to try it out!  The waiter (unfortunately I didn't catch his name) recognized us from previous visits and that was a pleasant experience. He remembered what our favourites were (including the lobster poutine, which was taken off the menu but replaced by something similar) and lamented with us that it's gone, but kindly suggested we try the new similar item, the pulled pork poutine, which we were about to order anyway. I have to say I preferred their good old lobster poutine (it's a classic!), but I'm glad I gave the new poutine a fair shot. The waiter also remembered how my partner and I liked to have all our apps and mains come at once, so I have to give props for the server's friendliness and ability to make us feel welcome. The manager / owner of the restaurant also came by during the course of our meal and asked us whether everything was to our liking; it seems like they're experimenting with new items and are quite open to customer feedback, which is a definite plus.  Overall, I'd rate the food as a 3.5-4/5 for the value, and the service a 4.5/5 (only gripe is that drinks could be refilled more frequently)."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and the food was great...then a cockroach walked across the table just as we were waiting for the bill. We had just treated my parents to dinner after not seeing them for a while, and I didn't want to kill the mood, so I just flicked it away. Now they keep asking me if we can go back and I don't know how to break it to them. Ugh, how about try someplace else?"}
{"text":"This Baton Rouge is located at Consumers Road and Thickson, not too far east of the massive AMC plaza. My boyfriend took me out here for our date night on a Saturday evening. We ended up going a little later, maybe around 7ish and we figured we would beat the usual dinner rush time. We were told a 30-40 minute wait but I think we were only there for 15-20 minutes before we were seated and they were fairly busy.  First of all, the restaurant was really busy - there seemed to be a lot of Christmas functions going on and whoever the hostess was didn't use their head because they put a party of two (clearly on a date) right in between two big parties (when there was space on the much quieter other side of the restaurant (which we saw later on)). The party on the left was incredibly loud and obnoxious. A bunch of older people who seemed to have no regard for the fact that this was a) a nice restaurant and b) that they weren't the only people there. We actually had someone shouting across the table at another person in their party... except directly at our table. Lovely. The other party was much quieter but had a bunch of people that kept milling around our table, getting up to go out smoking or just standing around which really intruded on our experience. Furthermore, they were getting in the way of the servers who were trying to deliver food and drinks. The best part? At least one manager walked through our area, which was loud at the time, and didn't stop off at our table or anything. They awkwardly paused at our table and then kept on their way.  We had enough time to look at the menu and pretty much decide before our server came to get drink orders. She came back, dropped them off.... and left without taking our order. She corrected herself and came back noting that she forgot to get our order but really... we're sitting with closed menus waiting.   We've both eaten at Baton Rouge before, and I was thoroughly impressed by the downtown location in the Eaton Centre so i was looking forward to a tasty and delicious meal! We both ended up ordering Ribs but I got Ribs and Chicken Fingers so that we could split the fingers. I ended up getting fries and the hot spiced apples on the side and my boyfriend got the garlic mashed potatoes. The ribs... were nothing special. I've made better ribs myself at the cottage and my boyfriend actually said that at the table. They were fall off the bone but not enough sauce and just a tad dry. For a restaurant that's known for ribs, that shouldn't happen. The chicken fingers were WAY too breaded, they came to the table looking massive but that was mostly breading. The chicken fingers I had at the downtown location a few years back were much better. The dijonnaise was quite good though. The spiced apples are always my favourite and were perfect as usual but the fries were so salty that I drained my drink and was dying for another. After a bit (and strategically placing my empty drink at the end of the table) our server came and took our empty drinks and said refills were on the way. Ten minutes later they showed up. Not impressed.  Overall this was a terrible experience for such a nice restaurant. I will not be back unless my boyfriend absolutely insists upon us going here. A few tips to the restaurant - don't seat small parties next to massive ones. If we had been on a first date, it would have made for a terrible experience. Be on top of parties that become loud and unruly. This party had a few drinks and was getting louder and louder until their food was served (they were loud through our entire experience except for about the last 20 minutes when they got their salads). You should have sat them in a different area (or us in a different area) and should have asked them to keep a lid on it when they got out of hand. You should have management visible in the restaurant so that if I have a problem, I can voice it to you. And your servers should be able to handle the number of people in their sections. It should NOT have taken 10 minutes for a drink refill. Our server should NOT have forgotten to take our order and she should have been present if we needed something or had an issue. Our server didn't even come to our table so we could pay, she dropped the bill off and a hostess came to give us the debit machine.  Absolutely poor service, mediocre food and a wretched experience. I'm so very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Stepped in to try their lobster risotto.  The risotto was ok. Very rich in taste for sure. The only thing I found weird about it was the corn ingredient in it. I have never had corn in a risotto before and it felt very out of place. There was a good enough helping of lobster in the risotto though. If I was to rate the risotto I'd probably give it a 2.5/5. Maybe without the corn I'd probably rate it higher.  For dessert I ordered a peanut butter fudge brownie cake. That was yum!!! Again very rich, sweet but really good! From a so so risotto I was happy with my desert and would recommend this!  My waitress was fast and dropped by often  to make sure everything was good.   Will come back but would try something else for sure."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it came up short in every area.  I should have checked the menu in advance.  The name suggested that I would be getting cajun/creole food.  No no no.  It lacks any hint of authentic Louisiana food.  No jambalaya, etouffe, gumbo, po boys, etc.  The \"beans\" i got were more like texas bbq beans than red beans.  The brie burger was... not very good.  I can't blame this restaurant specifically, though.  I have been told that Canada doesn't serve good burgers because of their limitation on undercooked ground meat, causing every restaurant to over cook all their patties.  Still, I had expected the brie to be baked or melted onto the burger (baked brie is awesome, burger is awesome, you'd think they'd marry the two).  However, it was a hard, cold slice of brie.    The service tried to be good, but it was obviously forced.  Sunday midday, empty restaurant, weird asian guy dining alone.  The service was as good as it needed, but there was no other substance beyond the bare necessity.  I may have to give this place another try, but I doubt it'll make my rotation before I leave town.    Oh, and a place called \"baton rouge\" should play the Saints game instead of some regional snow something or other.  WHO DAT?"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Baton Rouge I have ever been to.  Service- non-existent. You can literally walk into their bar, pour yourself one and walk out and they wouldn't have even known you were there except for the camera evidence..   I will update this review at a later time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening with five other people, and my experience exceeded expectations. Location was convenient next to the Mel Lastman Square and North York Centre Subway Station. Service was pleasant. Food was decent. I got Lobster Risotto and got to sample calamari appetizer (which was crispy, not soggy), the famous ribs (it wasn't super amazing as mentioned in the reviews below but not terrible, either), classic steak, sweet potato fries and mashed potatoes. They were all tasty. The only complaint is that we felt squeezed into the booth which would have comfortably seated about four people."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch & had the salmon salad. Salmon was done well, salad was too much like coleslaw for me. Lots of cabbage, etc. Would rather have had a green leaf salad. Anyway, the others that came with me had burgers with fries. The burger burns were pretty thick & the fries were plentiful. They told me it was yummy. Our waitress was a nice asian lady in her twenties. She was prompt & polite. Not sure if I would come back to eat here, I just wasn't that impressed with the salad. And salad's pretty hard to screw up."}
{"text":"I find Baton Rouge a little more casual and cheaper then the keg, but still good quality steak. The ribs are very good, same with the filet mignon. The Caesar salad was mediocre. I love the peppercorn sauce! I would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I wanted to review this Baton Rouge as well because I found the food to be really good (consistent with the Toronto Baton Rouge), and to also commend the wait staff on EXCELLENT service. There was a party of about 25 people and the serving staff were very polite, checking back just the right amount of times, and all of the meals came out at the same time (which is something that is hard to do with a large party) I am biased with this place because I find their chicken fingers to be the best chicken fingers I have tasted anywhere in Ontario. What makes them so delicious to me is that they are not breaded but rather battered. Jack Astor's has set the bar for chicken fingers, but in my opinion these ones are better (although Jack Astor's is also really good). The portion size is huge especially if you order fries with it. They provide two dipping sauces on the plate, a honey dijon and a bbq. They do not have wing sauce or plum sauce, but the sauces they give you does a fine job."}
{"text":"Baton Rouge has been around for years and it's still doing very well due to there great customer service? Great quality of food along with awesome atmosphere.  I wanted to try something different so I ordered the grilled veggie sandwich, mmmmm it was amazing! Hudge portion, literally 2 people can share."}
{"text":"Really nicely designed. Very comfortable and warm surroundings. Wonderfully friendly waiter.   Having said that - the food was pretty mediocre and very overpriced for what it was. It was okay but I'd rather go to the Keg."}
{"text":"I eat at Baton Rouge probably 5 times a year, usually very happy but I was at this location a few months ago and had a very bad experience.  Nachos with spinach dip were stale, waiter tried to tell us they were fine.  Then the manager came over with an attitude. Had to ask for water three time before it was delivered.  They eventually sent me a $50 gift certificate to go back but I just threw it in the garbage."}
{"text":"On a cold rainy night Baton Rouge sat my party of four quickly.   The host was execellent and I felt at home in their tacky steakhouse feel. It was warm and comfortable which made relaxing easy.  I ordered the three course meal : $31  Cesar salad - eh, lack of bold flavours  Filet minion - cooked to correct order  The fries and beans were ok too. The appetizer soup was really good as per my dining companions. I was full after our meal. The waiter was average because I could not find him for a refill or steak sauce.  Dessert - the cheesecake sucked.  $100 w/tax. Only 10% for a bad server"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Be ware....they won't do separate bills for parties which is absolutely ridiculous!  Will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"I went here for a co-workers retirement lunch and it was great.  Our waiter (I can't remember his name!) was so nice.  They set us up all at one huge round table which was good because we all got to sit around with everyone.  I recommend the chicken tender salad. Amazing. The chicken is nice and chunky and the salad is a good mix, try it with honey mustard dressing. Yum.  Very mature atmosphere which is always nice."}
{"text":"We stopped here to for my wife's birthday dinner with a party of 12. Everything went smoothly and the service was great.   We started with calamari which was excellent and the spinach dip. The spinach dip was good and they give you plenty of tortilla chips with a small side of sour cream and salsa. Great to share...  I ordered the cowboy ribeye with fries. veggies, and a lobster tail. My food was great. The steak was cooked perfectly, the lobster tail was sweet and juicy, the fries were seasoned nicely and the veggies were cooked \"al dente\".   A lot of people in our group ordered the ribs. There was a unanimous decision that the ribs were A++. They looked good and fell off the bone.   *My mother in law ordered the salmon and she thought she could do a better job at home.*  Overall everyone had a pretty good meal, no complaints really...   We will add this to our list of spots to hit up when the line at the keg is too long..."}
