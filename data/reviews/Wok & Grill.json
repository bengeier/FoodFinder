{"text":"I stumbled upon this food court inside the Highmark building by accident and boy am I glad I did. It's one of my favorite spots for lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh. Not only do I love Wok & Grill but the pizza place has actual REAL pretty decent pizza (something hard to find in Pittsburgh), a place called Flamers that makes excellent American tacos, and Charley's who seem to make pretty good cheese steaks (although I've only ate there once I've heard good things).

I usually end up at Wok & Grill. I have to say this is the best \"express\" Chinese food I've ever had, and even some of the better Chinese food I've ever had at normal sit down Chinese restaurants. For starters, the lady whose always there to take my order is always super super friendly, remembers my order, and often offers me a free sample of whatever I like (which is how I fell in love with their spicy chicken). My opinion may be a little biased because I almost always get their spicy chicken with white rice or noodles and I love spice. If you want it to be even more spicy, they have a delicious spicy sauce next to all their soy sauce, duck sauce, etc. which I put all over my food. Don't be surprised if you have to - ahem - go to the bathroom shortly after but that's really the price you pay with any spicy food.

I've had their egg rolls too which are really good as well as their general tso's which was also good. They even make a decent hot & sour soup. The only thing I've tried that I'm not crazy about was their spicy tofu, something seemed a little off about it, but I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it as I tried a free sample. That was a while ago so maybe they improved the recipe. 

This place is also pretty cheap if you're on a budget, I'd recommend just bringing your own drink. I do that almost everywhere I go out to eat and you'd be surprised how much money you can save by doing that alone. Anyway, solid place!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 basics- an egg roll and lo mien.  The egg roll was steaming hot and the outside was crispy & perfect... but there was nothing but filler inside.  I also ordered the lo mien- they were out so she offered to make it fresh... bad choice!  I've never had lo mein this soggy before.  Tastes like it was swimming in water in the wok.  I won't be back here...  Ever..."}
{"text":"Terrible. Asked for chicken teriyaki, no veggies, steamed rice with extra sauce. Got the combo with a egg roll and drink. Got over cooked rice, 1 tiny scoop of chicken, veggies, no extra sauce, and a dry egg roll. Asked for regular snapple,  got raspberry. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Located in 5th Ave place downtown Wok & Grill is decent little food court option for the lunch crowd dahtahn.  
I like this place because I can get a quick, cheap, and moderately healthy lunch just a couple blocks from where I work.  If not for the proximity though I am not sure if I'd ever visit this place because it's just so middle of the road.  
That being said my typical lunch here is the chicken and broccoli or chicken and green beans.  I get this with white rice and raw veggies, I've never opted for the egg rolls because they don't look too appetizing.  The veggies are pretty fresh and have some snap to them.  The sauce is good and meat is indeed chicken and tasty.  
The lady who always seems to be working is very friendly and like I said everything is fast and cheap.
