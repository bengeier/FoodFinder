{"text":"Sûrement un des meilleurs burgers que j'ai mangé (j'ai commandé le classique) à un très bon prix. Les ingrédients étaient bien équilibrés. Souvent, je trouve que le goût de boeuf est trop présent dans les burgers, mais ce n'était pas le cas dans celui-ci. Les employés sont toujours gentils et serviables, j'espère qu'ils en ouvront plus comme celui-là."}
{"text":"Excellent berger et frites un peu dispendieux pour un dîner mais appréciable pour le prix d'un souper.  * suggestions menu midi petit prix ;)  Endroit sombre manques de lumière.  Excellent accueil du patron qui est au petit soin des clients."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers! Awesome service! Great prices! Burgers are home made, and some selection for children as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Pomme Frite!!! Lovely decor and quite busy with a private function going on around 6 PM on a Saturday night. Despite being so busy, we got to order right away with helpful staff. I expected to wait a little but our food was brought to us in less than 10 minutes. Very nice.  I went with their Deluxe cheeseburger with extra patty. Bacon, lettuce.... tomatoes.... all very fresh. The meat patties were the real deal people!!! Angus beef made to measure a quarter pound AFTER they leave the grill! That burger didn't stand a chance.  They offer soda in both fountain or glass fornat. Glass coke is pure class and goes well with theit good fries and fantastic burger.  Spoke with the owner and he seemed like a real nice guy. Second location is in the works to be opened in the Mile-End area in early 2017. Was very passionate about his establishment.  Definitely worth a look if you're in the area.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Super bon petit restaurant! Le restaurant est très bien situé pour les élèves au collège Lionel-Groulx. Le prix est très abordable, il y a même un prix pour les étudiants! Les portions sont bonnes ainsi que la qualité. J'ai essayé leur burger et c'était succulent! Je recommande cette place si vous voulez remplir un trou dans votre estomac dans un restaurant!"}
{"text":"I absolute love the decor of this place! Great food, and the waiting time is the average when there's lot of people, but the fries and burgers are definitely worth the wait! Perfect amount of pickles, tomatoes and lettuce, and onions in the burgers. The fries are just perfect to me, not too crispy and not too soft either.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm very excited that Pomme Frite is in Ste Therese. Grew up in the area and we desperately needed a good burger place. The burgers are real good. The beef patty is a little thin, but all the ingredients are real fresh and the most important is everything is made to order. My personal favourite are the french fries. They are the BOMB!!! Super crispy, hot and the dipping sauces are a great side. The poutine are equally great. Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to Pommes Frites on a few occasions now and all I can say is it's the real deal folks! If you want the tastiest burgers in the 450 area code get your butt down here before more people find out how good they are. They use fresh ingredients, pile them on high and when the bun and patty hits your mouth they create an explosion of sensory overload in the taste buds. Everything is well thought of and masterfully assembled together. The fries poutine are equally delicious. The gravy, cheese and crispy potatoes are exactly how I close my eyes and envision a poutine to taste. An added plus is you can order a beer here with your burger AKA shake shack style. Prices are reasonable and it's now my go to place on the north shore for burgers. Everyone who appreciates food knows Chez Tousignant for MTL burgers. Soon the will know Pommes Frites on the North Shore! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Truely terrible everything. Burger was terrible, bun was stale, cheese was plastic junk, fries were both burnt and soggy at the same time. And it was expensive just to add insult to injury. This would have been bad at half the price. Most of the meal went into the trash and I got dinner somewhere else. Avoid this place for sure."}
