{"text":"A bunch of my co-reviewers seem to think that Seoul Garden is the best Korean food in town, and I'm not going to disagree, but I still remain hopeful that either this place improves or another better place opens. It's difficult to stumble across this establishment unless you live in the area, but word of mouth seems to be spreading.  My partner heard about it from several non-Asian colleagues, who raved about it.  So, on a Saturday night, we hopped in the car and made the trek.  You don't go to Seoul Garden for the ambiance, because, frankly, there's not much of that to be found.  The exterior is easy to miss, and you'd probably be better off looking for the Pizza Hut sign next door, when trying to find it from the car.  It's a nondescript little wastrel of a building with a large sign, but somehow it just seems to blend into the overall commercial decay  that surrounds it.  The interior is swathed in light wood paneling, and there is very little about it to suggest that it's a Korean restaurant, other than the menu, which is fairly extensive for Cleveland.  The most interesting, and by that I really mean incongruous, was the cuckoo clock over the cash register.  I don't know if it was a leftover from a previous restaurant that may have occupied the space, or if the owner is just a fan of Black Forest craftwork.   The restaurant was also quiet, in an eerie way.  There was no background music, and when we arrived at about 9PM, there was only one other table eating, so there was no sense of people dining out and enjoying themselves.  Over the course of our meal, however, a few more tables arrived, and it began to feel a little less desolate.  My co-reviewer was correct about the great expanse of banchan (complementary side dish/appetizers) that they put out.  I counted 12 dishes, including three varieties of kimchee type dishes, sweet beans, potato salad, seaweed, broccoli stems, and a stone pot of puffed egg.  While I didn't care to try all of it, what did appeal to me tasted good, and my partner liked most of what he tasted.  As a white guy with limited capacity for spicy food, I went for the bibimbap, and I got an order of the fried beef dumplings.  The dumplings were perfectly fine - pretty much exactly as I had anticipated they would taste.  My meal was served in the traditional stone pot, and the rice had crusted nicely along the interior.  I couldn't handle the hot sauce they served with it, and so I found it a little bland, but that's more the fault of my palate than their recipe.  My partner went for some beef and tofu soup that looked frighteningly red to me, which he enjoyed, but felt was lacking a little sweetness and acidity.    When we asked for the bill, they brought it out with two little containers of sweet Asian yogurt drinks, sort of like the orange wedges that many Chinese and Japanese restaurants bring out as a palate cleanser.  Overall the portions are large, and you're not likely to leave hungry.  Mt partner took half of his soup home for lunch later in the week.  I did feel that they were a little overpriced for the food - it seemed like every dish was $2-3 more than I thought it should be.  In fact, I had wanted to try the bulgogi, but it was $17, and I just didn't feel the ingredients or the ambiance merited that sort of expense.  The young woman who served us was very attentive, in the best sense of the word, and kept our glasses filled.  I would go back, particularly with some Koreans who could share their insight into the authenticity and quality of the food, but I'm in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"This is the place that I go very often when I am at home. The dish called \"galbi\" is the dish I like to order almost every time. It is the BEST!  Galbi has the very nice texture of the beef, not too dry, or too bloody, it is just about right.  I like their side dishes as well. They provide about 8 small plates of side dishes. Most of the time, I will be already filled up only by eating the side dishes.  Two of them I like most from the side dishes are the white jelly with seaweed sprinkles on it, and the steamed egg.  Tips: The steamed egg was made from the mixture of egg and fish soup. If you are allergy to fish, watch this one, even thought it is delicious."}
{"text":"Good Korean food with fresh tasting Banchans.  This is very good Korean food for the midwest.  The pricing may seem a bit high but it is due to the Banchans and steamed egg that comes with the meal.  It is a good experience and my wife and I will surely return.  Seafood jigae and lamb were both tasty.  Rice cake apps were really interesting, but portions were huge. -KD"}
{"text":"Really delicious. I recommend the bulgogi! Honestly my favorite Korean restaurant in Ohio !"}
{"text":"amazing assortment of banchan, wonderful and friendly staff. This place has a family style appeal with large servings and an upbeat setting. It's a hole in the wall kind of place but its quite a gem!! So far there hasnt been a thing Ive tried on the menu I dont like!"}
{"text":"I love Korean and Seoul Garden did not disappoint! Fast friendly service and the food is great. My favorite (besides the variety of side dishes) was the spicy crispy fried chicken."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! The servers were very extremely nice. They are quick and the food was delicious! I had a great time and wasn't rushed even though they were closing soon."}
{"text":"So tasty it's worth the charred meat smell that lingers for days (despite multiple ablution)  When I get that craving for spicy, piquant, charred protein...nothing will satisfy till I can chow down a huge platter of galbi...gnawing away at the yummy bits next to the bone...Seoul Garden is where I go for my Korean bbq fix.  I also love the dol-sot bibimbap here...the rice sizzling at the bottom of the stone pot forms into a nice crunchy crust...and if it's more starch that you want, then I'd happily recommend the seafood with green onion pancake  Like all terrific Korean bbq places, the meat platters come with endless little bowls of kimchi in all its various glorious permutations...and if you can manage to plow your way though all that, they'll bring you more till you're literally rolling out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tons of delicious appetizers. Have gone there a couple of times and have never been disappointed. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Cleveland! (Although I'll never try anywhere else after coming here). Food is excellent, spicy, flavorful and generous portions for the price. Service staff is very nice and environment inside is cozy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best korean food I have tried! Lots of side dishes. Every dish I have tried so far is awesome. I like the steam eggs, kimchi soup, kalbi, bulgogi and the octopus."}
{"text":"Beware.... Not Korean bbq; Korean boil! Bulgogi looked like a stew. Jap Che noodles drenched in oil. Horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"I had some extra time to kill on my way to (dumpy) cleveland airport so i veered off the road fast and furious style to get me some delicious korean food. It was only 1030 in the morning so i wasn't sure if it'd be open but I figured anything is better than waiting around at the airport. i walked in to find the family proprietors enjoying their morning breakfast. They eat their own food - thats a good sign. There was some feigned confusion and contrition on my part at having arrived before business hours and interrupting their breakfast, but it did the trick.  The wife seated me and brought me a menu. I ordered a boiling hot bowl of fish stew. The banchan was plentiful and delicious.  There were even some \"premium\" banchans you normally only get at fancier places like egg jjim and japchae. the japchae was so tasty i got a bit to go. it only cost $3 and it was enough for 2 meals! unfortunately the stew was not as good - it was a thin broth and obviously had not been boiling away for hours to develop depth and flavor. the fish, though were were numerous big pieces, was a touch undercooked. I can't fault them too much though since i did tell them i had to get to the airport.  anyway like most Korean restaurants i've seen in the midwest, decor is heinous. pale (bamboo?) wood paneling as far as the eye can see. but who cares when you are enjoying great food and service :)"}
{"text":"Nice homely restaurant located in a rather quiet area on Pearl road.  Served traditional corn tea served warm.  The food is very good. One of the best if not the best Korean food in the area.  Proportions are great as well; enough to fill a family with few orders.  Would definately recommend this place for authentic Korean food for west Clevelanders."}
{"text":"There is a large framed and autographed picture of former Cleveland Indians Baseball player Sin Soo Choo hanging on the wall. You know a Korean joint is good when you have native Korean athletes coming there for a taste of their homeland.  I came in for lunch, and the first thing I noticed was that the restaraunt itself is very simple and plain. Nothing flashy, but the service is quick and courteous.  I had the naengmyun (cold noodles in ice broth) and it was good. Not out of this world, but pretty spot on. Naengmyun with kalbi during the summer is GAME OVER. SO GOOD. The reason I gave this place 5 stars, and I will go again is because the side dishes are plentiful,  and they also bring out for you the boiling egg pot!   The food comes out quick, and they also give you a dessert drink called Yogurtu. It tastes very sweet. It took me back to when I was a kid, when my mother used to buy them for my brother and I during the summer. So GOOD!  5 STARS for a nice Korean restaraunt that has great authentic cusinse, fast and great service, and a large parking lot!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top ten places in cleveland area. Also as stated in other reviews they did take their sign down so it is extremely hard to find since it looks like a vacant building. I take everyone that visit me from out of town here. The prices seem high but honestly the portions are perfect if you share dishes or don't share and eat for days!"}
{"text":"i've been to this place countless times and it never ceases to wow me.:) i loooovvvveee spicy food and this is my go to place. the food is really good and affordable. i love the endless array of banyan or side dishes. also the yogurt drink at the end of a meal is, i think, a very nice variation from having oranges or fortune cookies.  the exterior of the restaurant doesn't say much. the interior is very cozy and homey. the staff are polite and attentive.  all in all, Seoul garden is like an oyster.. a little rough on the outside with a heavenly and delicious surprise inside!:)  you must try this place!!:)"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall was a nice surprise. The food was wonderful and so was the staff."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and each time I am left fully satisfied. Food is authentic and tasty, paired with good service. Bonchon is sooo good and they always ask if you want more when you finish it. The Seafood Pajoen is filling and tasty, you should try it. This will be an establishment I frequent and the first place I think of when I want Korean."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit to this spot. Service was fast and attentive. Food was fantastic. My daughter is the expert on Korean food so I let her order her favs for us to share. We grilled our own beef lettuce wraps with lots of banchan choices. Also great rice cakes. The crowd was mix of family dining and foodies. A very fun time that I would like to repeat soon !"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Korean restaurants in Cleveland. It has nice bamboo fixtures. They have a large menu, so if you don't like spicy then you can get something milder. However, I do like my food spicy. The kimchi is very fresh and they make some of the appretzers they give you before the main course. I recommend this place for lunch, there service is very quick. Its something different than the normal fast food and chain restaurants nearby. My favorites are the bbq and the kimchi soups. Prices are reasonable. I haven't been there for dinner, but from the pictures on the menu makes me want to give it a try."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Cleveland. Side dishes were yummy and plentiful! I got the veggie pancake and tofu stew and left with enough leftovers for two meals! Pricing is comparable to other Korean restaurants. Don't be fooled by the small building and run-down exterior it is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"So good! The same you would get in Korea! The kimchi is great and I would recommend the dok boa ki, rice cake in spicy sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Dont let the size of the place turn you way. The food was amazing we had the beef bogugie and the spice squid. the portion are big and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"best korean restaurant in the cleveland metro.  delicious food, homey environment, good service.   what we had  banchan (free)  decent.  doesn't wow, but good.  tofu, potato, the green thing, eggplant, and kimchi are good.  matter of preference, this is your veggie fix for the meal.  not just an appetizer but complements the galbi and bibimbap.  also works as side dishes.  (7 / 10)  ttukbaegi gyeranjin (free)  soft tofu like texture.  refreshing and nice saltiness, scallions add to texture and bites through mild egg flavor.  (7/10)  galbi ($17.95)   tender.  nice balanced flavor. sweetness is just right.  extremely tender.  nice char on the beef.  good quantity, love the small slices, makes eating it easy.  finish off by cutting the parts surrounding the bone.  then take the bone and eat the rest of the meat like a drumstick.  really really good stuff.  you can't go wrong with galbi, but others are too sweet, or too tough.  this is close to perfect.  highly highly recommended.  (9/10)    haemool gopdol bee bim bop ($13.95). (seafood bee bim bop)  best bee bim bop we've ever had.  spicy pepper sauce is what brings out the flavor.  surprised at the good ratio of vegetables and seafood to rice.  some korean restaurants bombard you with so much rice in a clear effort to economize.  here, no, perfect ratio.  a lot of small squid, mussels, and shrimp.  vegetables complement a lot.  the egg yolk seals the deal, and as we said, the spicy pepper sauce brings out the flavor.  (9.5/10 chopsticks)  great meal. thoroughly enjoyed it. again, best korean restaurant in the cleveland metro."}
{"text":"This was a first-time Korean dining experience for my little family of three. This will certainly NOT be our last, it was soo good. My husband remarked on the way home that Korean food is his new favorite asian cuisine. When we were sat they set us up with plastic bottles of what looked like green tea. The tea was amazing - a very slight sweetness but also earthy and balanced. It was very refreshing; it's corn and barley tea and it has no caffeine. Did I mention that this is complimentary with refills? After placing our order the waitress brought around 9 small plates with different types of kimchi, pickled vegetables, steamed egg, and some sort of tofu. It looked different, we didn't know what each dish was except for the kimchi dishes. I was a little hesitant at first, but they all were amazing. They had such rich flavor, crisp and clean taste. I don't recall the Korean names but we ordered a cold noodle dish and the grilled short ribs. The grilled short ribs were amazing - sweet, salty and spicy as well as an excellent texture; not too much fat. The noodles were also fantastic, it was served with a variety of vegetables, sweet/spicy sauce, beef and a hard boiled egg. The presentation was ideal because we could pick and choose what we wanted from the bowl without issue. The meal closed with these little sweetened yogurt-milk drinks. They had a fruity flavor that somehow was the perfect end to the meal. Don't let the unknown scare you if you're unfamiliar with Korean cuisine - it is so worth it."}
{"text":"I used to like here a lot but the food is not as good anymore. Korean house in downtown is so much better compare to here. However, I would like to point out the service here is so bad. There is a server, he is the shorter one to be precise, he does not serve refill tea even though he passed by our table for many times. Plus we needed more side dishes, but when he serves us our food, and we told him we wanted more, he ignored!"}
{"text":"Really great Korean food in a nice, homey atmosphere.  You get sooo much banchan and its all delicious. They seem to keep the staples but change up the other items pretty frequently.  Everything that I've eaten was delicious, tofu appetizer, kalbi, spicy shrimp, seafood pancake, bibimbap, etc. Huge portions too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice and clean. My wife and I ordered the pork belly BBQ, and it tasted similar to what we had in China, which I think is quite to the authentic Korean food. Side Dishes are delicious too. Recommend it. The only thing is they require you to order at least two BBQ."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Cleveland. Love the banchan and their Galbi dish. Soon dobu is not too bad either (wish tofu pieces were bigger). Generous portions. Authentic Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Great place. Lots of interesting food options. You have to be ready to try something new though"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Looks a little divy, but the food is authentic and tastes just as good as it looks. Its quiet and the staff is super nice and attentive without being overbearing. We got the ssamgyupsal for two and had lots to take home. Its delicious and reasonably priced. What a gem!"}
{"text":"This is now Ichiban, and it's awesome.  Very nice decor.  The best kimchi I have ever had.  Had a soba noodle dish with some vegetables and beef.  Great bi bimbap also.  Some Korean restaurants really keep the banchan (appetizers) flowing.  Ichiban doesn't.  And they could use a few more exotic ones - anchovies, lotus root, those sweet potato like things, not sure what they are.  But the service was very nice.  Have to do the barbecue next time."}
{"text":"I went to Seoul Garden for the first time after reading all of the reviews.  I have tried a few other Korean restaurants in the downtown area as well and found that this restaurant is just plain amazing.  When my friend and I went (a Thursday evening around 7) it was jam packed and we had to wait about 5 minutes.  The owner and people who work there are very nice and quickly got us a spot to sit.  I had the dukbokki as an appetizer (just the right amount of spiciness and yummy vegetables) and for my main I had the galbee.  The galbee was served on a skillet with vegetables and was super tender.  I had seen on a few reviews that you could cook your own meat so I am hoping the next time I go I can try that out.  The banchan was very good.  I am not very into banchan in general but the variety we had last night was tasty.  My friend ordered the shumai and the bibimbap.  It was her first time trying Korean food and she loved it.  Even though it was crowded (and getting even more crowded as we sat there) the server (who happens to be the daughter of the owner) did not rush us and greeted everyone and asked for their drink order while quickly cleaning tables to seat more people.  I asked her about Korean language lessons and she let me know about an organization that offers classes. When our check came they gave us a teeny yogurt flavored drink (I am still trying to find the official name for this) and it was yummy.  When I visited my birth home years ago, we had this all of the time.  Also, they offer SOJU!!!!! I have been trying for years to get some of this Korean beer...Next time I will have to take part in that.  They also offer take out as well which, again, I am excited to try out.  It looks really shabby on the outside but the inside is cozy and filled with delicious food and caring people who love sharing that delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Seoul garden many times. But this is the worse service I ever had. I went for lunch I ordered the dinner portion the tall guy waiter told me they run out the side dish. Then I said is OK. After that I ask I want to get another bowl of rice he said \"one portion only come one rice\" I always been this restaurant the other waitress girl was always give me extra. The problem is I have not full and haven't finish my lunch yet. The tall guy waiter seem want me to leave the restaurant very fast. I feel like he so cheap and not respect the requirements of the guests"}
{"text":"Holy Yum!  Everything is fresh and delicious!  Short ribs were amazing.  Duuk Bo Gi (spelling wrong - giant rice noodles) super yummy.  This place is authentic!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I wish it were closer to me. It's a little pricey for the ambiance, but it's so worth it because the food is amazing and plentiful. The pancakes are delicious and huge. I've also enjoyed the spicy rice cakes, japchae, and vegetable jigae."}
{"text":"This unknown restaurant packs a HUGE punch! I am always telling people about it, pointing it out to them, etc, because everyone that I've ever taken there falls absolutely in love with the awesome staff and the amazing, amazing, amazing Korean food! Koreans in the area know and love this restaurant, and the Indians' own Shin Soo Choo is known to like the restaurant and frequent it - they have his signed jersey hanging on the wall. You always know when an Asian restaurant is good if it attracts lots of its own people. The food is very authentically Korean, and comes with a wonderful selection of panchan (little dishes of pickled vegetables, kimchi, etc). The kimchi is just perfect.  I love their dumplings and their japjae. Literally, just thinking about them makes my mouth water. The highlight of the meal is the Korean bbq. You walk in the door and you smell the smokey and sweet smell of the barbecued bulgogi and galbi - my two favorite menu items. It comes to the table sizzling, dripping with juices - then the chopstick war begins as everyone at the table vies for the delicious food. I really don't understand how they keep their meat so tender and perfectly cooked. It is so soft and chewy but completely done, even crispy at the edges - it's just perfect. I've never had better Korean food, and I've tried all kinds of Korean restaurants in New York City and San Francisco. This little gem in Parma, Ohio really holds its own.  I'd say this is my absolute favorite restaurant, and if I somehow knew that I had one last night to live, one more meal to eat - I'd definitely gorge myself on all the Korean deliciousness that Seoul Garden has to offer."}
{"text":"Only complaint is that soondubu is still a bit bland and not spicy enough. Otherwise banchan is very good and plentiful and all other dishes are really tasty and spicy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Easy to get to you, don't have to go far for good food. Always experienced good service. Inside is small, but never had to wait for a table. Did do take out before, food was just as good as eating there."}
{"text":"Okay they do give you a lot of banchan and it's not bad and the people are nice ... there is even a lil shrine to Shin Soo Choo, but ayyy my main dish, dolsit bibimbap, was well really weak.  First of all there is no meat.  Okay, I could live with that if the veggies were really good.  They were not and they are minimal.  Spinach leaves instead of seasonsed spinach (sigumchi namul), no bean spouts!(??) instead the aforementioned spinach leaves, carrots a few stem of kosari and a few shrooms ... weak.  Sauce was watery.  Wouldn't have minded all this and might have given them one more star, but price is much too high.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service. Will surely come back when in the area. A bit pricey but well worth it for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean in town no contest. I was impressed with the freshness and the quality of everything I ate. Let's start with the Banchan, which are the little plates of food that come with your meal and heads up to the Korean food novices out there you can keep refilling these at no extra cost. Seoul Garden had the best selection of Banchan I have ever seen in my life from the fish cakes to the potatoes everything was so good. We also ordered the Dduck Bok Gi, spicy rice cakes and the Kimchi pancake and both were incredibly huge portions and delicious. I got a Seafood Bim Bop for an entree which in all reality I probably did not need, but was really good as well. It had octopus, mussels, and calamari in it and was super fresh. I feel like this restaurant is slightly more expensive than other local Korean restaurants but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"\"Great service! They really took good care of us unlike other Korean restaurants where they are not very friendly...food was yummy...not very spicy by Korean standards....I would definitely go back for more!!\""}
{"text":"My husband and  I love their Seafood pan cake!!! Good place for both lunch and dinner.  I recommend here if you want good Korean food!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the Good Reviews!!! Beef  Bulgogi was very good!  Staff was kind and efficient. Veggie pancake...Excellent! Will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience here.  The waitress was super nice, and brought my son several refills of the fish cake banchan.  I had not tried one of those \"pancakes\" that everyone talks about on the reviews, so we got the veggie one.  I thought it was really good, and a huge portion for the price.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went there this evening after reading the reviews in here.   Have been to another one in town when I used to come to Cleveland for work a lot...this is MUCH better.   One of the best duk mandu guk I've had in a long time.   Huge serving, lots of rice cakes, dumplings, and a super generous portion of shredded stewed beef that was very tender.   Very thick and hearty, not too garlicky or salty, nice foil to the many banchan.    As others have mentioned, you get a large assortment of banchan.   Loved the kimchee they served....aged just right, almost to the point of old but not too much.  The service was excellent, very quick and attentive.   My dmg took a while to come out because there were several other large tables of happy diners, but I didn't mind.   They kept replacing and refilling my banchan and tea.   And the prices...incredibly reasonable for the amount of food you get!   Well worth the drive to Parma.  PS...just came from second meal/lunch there.   Unbelievable....12 banchan sides with my soon dubu (extra large already!).  All for only $7.95.  And they offered to refill my banchan dishes.   For the first time at a Korean restaurant I almost couldn't finish all the food.   And it was good!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Parma. Our second visit was as good as our first and I'm sure there will be more to come. The first time we dined here my husband ordered the Kalbi BBQ. It was delicious. I had a soup equally good but don't remember the name. This last visit we wanted to try something new and after reading other yelpers recommendations my husband got the Kahm Poong Gi extra spicy and it was excellent. I had to try the so popular Seafood Pajeon (seafood pancake). I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The banchan was a plethora of different sides. Our meals were excellent and we had so many left overs for the next day. Can't wait to return.   The service was great. Same waiters both times. The decor is o.k. but you go there for the great food not for the ambiance. I can't wait to try one of their casserole dishes next time."}
{"text":"When I first looked at the prices on the menu I thought it was a little pricey for hole-in-the-wall food.  That was before the food arrived and I realized the two of us had enough for five people in front of us.  And everything was delicious.  We had the vegetarian pancake (the size of a medium pizza) the ribs, and the appetizers.  The Kim Chi and the potatoes were amazing.  I am not on the west side much, but if I get a chance I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful and super filling!  The service was great, they had a really good understanding of their menu and could answer any questions. They were incredibly fast to get our food on the table.    The food was wonderful, we ordered several plates split between the family.  The ribs were my favorite.    I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"As someone coming from a town with a HUGE Korean population near Chicago, North East Ohio is a bit lacking when it comes to anything Korean.  Anyway, a colleague wanted to try some Korean food with me so we went to Seoul Garden which is pretty much our only choice.  I ordered the Yuk Gae Jang (Spicy beef soup) and she ordered the hot pot Bibimbop.  As a reviewer mentioned previously, I think I made a bad menu choice. Yuk Gae Jang is definitely NOT Seoul Garden's strong point what so ever. The broth is pretty much water with some pepper flakes and pepper oil in it. No depth, no umami, no beef broth flavor.  I didn't try the Bibimbop but I'm guessing it was pretty standard. Kind of hard to screw Bibimbop up.  The banchans were quite good and service was ok.  I do feel like other menus may be better but for what we had, it was just meh. I'll return to try other stuff in the future (I don't really have much of a choice it seems)."}
{"text":"This place would easily go unnoticed by simply driving by however when you walk in you are greeted by a friendly staff and so many delicious aromas. Having only had Korean once before the menu is slightly intimidating. We had the fried dumplings, bulgogi and spicy seafood pot. Total meal was $43 and the serving size was ample. I would come back to this place easily to try the table BBQ they offer."}
{"text":"Closest thing we've had to legit KBBQ. Came on a Sunday and were seated right away. Kalbi (short ribs) was a little on the chewy side and not your traditional slice with the three bones...literally a rib rib. Jap chae was savory and delicious. Overall, good flavors. Huge portions, good side dishes, and free wifi. Definitely coming back to try the kahm poong gi (spicy fried chicken)....seemed like every table had an order or maybe even two!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is 100% not here for American tourists, which is great.   We were seated after a few minutes of people coming in and out of the kitchen and wondering who was the hostess (a gentle wondering, mind you, we weren't being impatient, just taking everything in). We were brought two cups of hot tea that tasted like maybe barley tea? It had a toasty flavor. Not offered water (this is a feature, not a bug). They also don't have forks, so I had to give my dining companion a crash course in chopsticks.  We both ordered stone pot bibimbop, which comes with mushrooms, carrots, radish, beef, an egg, lettuce, and some long beans with a greyish color. We also shared an order of dumplings. The dumplings were great. The banchan they brought out was also pretty great. It was the first time that I had ever gotten eggs sizzling in a stone pot before as part of the banchan.   The bibimbop was good but not my favorite iteration of the dish that I've had. The long beans were hard to eat with the rest of the food in the bowl (so long!) and were an unappetizing color to me; the mushrooms had an unpleasant texture to me, as well. These are just personal things that aren't my preferences. The stone pot did a great job getting the rice crispy without having to wait forever to eat (as I have had to do in some places where the stone pot isn't doing the job because it isn't hot enough). My friend really liked his food but also made a comment about the beans looking unappetizing.  I did wish for maybe larger pieces of beef (same amount, just cut bigger) or just a tad more seasoning. As it was, the beef got totally lost. Which, I wouldn't mind it not having beef at all, just that I was looking forward to it. Still? I ate almost my entire dish. It wasn't my absolute favorite, but it was good.  One of the highlights was the dessert, which they brought with our check; a little milkshake in a bottle that was delightful. Both my dining companion and I were surprised and delighted.  Service was quick and friendly. No complaints at all there. I would come back for sure and try other dishes."}
{"text":"He a group lunch here recently, we a bunch of my adventurous co-workers.  I had been here several years ago (but not recently) and wanted to re-visit to see if it was as good as I'd remembered...it was!  The meal seems to go on forever!!!  A simple lunch combination includes tea, an 8-course benching, a lovely egg soufflé, the main lunch \"box\" and an orange-creamsicle drink in the end.  Hence...the NEED to have this meal with a large group of folks as it is almost way too much food for just a few folks to consume.  The banchan course contains a variety of vegetable dishes (both hot and cold), some of which are flavorful while others are spicy.  The egg soufflé came to the table a bit later than the banchan and it was still cooking / steaming inside the small cast iron pout.  It was fluffly and flavorful.  For the main dish, I ordered the Bulgogi beef (sliced ribeye in a light sauce) which was tasty...but previously I ordered the Kalbi beef (grilled short rib) and tasting that dish again confirmed it was my favorite amongst these two choices.  The lunch \"box\" comes with the main dish, a cup of sticky rise, a small potsticker, salad and a (cold) glass noddle dish.  Everything tasted fresh and flavorful making for a very enjoyable and satisfying meal.  After the main service was completed, our waitress brought each of us a small orange-creamsicle tasting drink (kind of like a smoothie) as a palate cleaning finisher.  For the price paid, this spot is an incredible value with a ton a great tasting dishes and a ton of variety.  Will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a first date recently. It was a Sunday night. We were seated promptly. I love Asian food, and Korean is one of my favorites, so I was really looking forward to trying Seoul Garden. Happy to say, I was not disappointed!.   For starters, we had the Ddaek Bok Gi. It is a favorite standard and this was as good as I've had. We also had a spicy tofu soup that was so satisfying on a chilly night.   My date recommended the beef BBQ, which he cooked for us on a grill they brought to our table. The first grill wasn't cooking properly, and the staff noticed immediately and replaced it without us even asking. The beef was thinly sliced and delicious. It is served with large lettuce leaves and rice to make wraps. The dipping sauces were excellent; I cant' decide which I preferred. Of course, we had an array of Korean sides, and these were all very tasty as well. We also had the egg custard which was creamy and delicious.  As a side note, the waiter was very polite, attentive, and adorably cute! I felt like we were in a kdrama restaurant scene, and they had cast an idol to be our server lol. He reminded me of Baekyun from EXO. (Sadly, our waiter claimed that he cannot sing. Yes, I asked heehee)  We drank quite a lot of soju, mostly because my date's friends (who happened to be there  dining too) thought it was cute to send it over to our table. So just know that if you get a bit too happy and decide to turn the parking lot into an outdoor dance floor with your car stereo blaring, someone will call the police. (Props to him though, he was cool and just asked us to take it somewhere else lol.  So a fun date, and a great restaurant that I will visit again."}
{"text":"This is only authentic (or claiming to be authentic) restaurant I have ever been. So my review is purely based on my experience there and not comparing to anything else.   The place has a feeling of a family owned restaurant. There is a fishy aroma in the restaurant ! They require you to order one dish per person on the table.   I was there to try Korean food. I must say I am impressed by the variety they serve with every dish. I liked most of the stuff. The good thing about having so many options on the table is always there. I am from Gujarat state of India where they always serve many things in a meal, to give everyone an option. Korean food reminded me of that. I was also impressed with their cooking. Even though it has the same kind of ingredients as Thai, Japanese and Chinese food, it maintains its distinct flavor.   Overall it was a good experience, I will recommend this place to anyone who is looking for authentic (at least that is my impression) Korean food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yum, just yum. Not the best looking restaurant or area but the food is great. Came here for lunch. Service was a bit slow since only one lady was working on the floor, but she was great. The ban chan was great and tasty. The yuk kae jang was flavorful and full of deliciousness. Great deal for the price."}
{"text":"Second day in Cleveland and wanting to try out the Korean food here. Even though the restaurant is small and quaint but the food and affordability of the menu gives it a 5 star experience. I ordered the lunch special #12 seafood tofu soup $8.95. Came with the complete side dishes and egg soup. Big portion and service was great."}
{"text":"Unless someone else is paying, no way am I going back.  Others that ate with me would not even give this place one star.  I at least enjoyed the banchan.  The chicken fried rice was tasty, but not for $16.  I split the beef brisket that you grill at the table with one person, while others had the rice and something I can't remember.  My meat was terrible.  Many of the paper thin pieces were just fat.  The person sharing with me had two bites and said yuk.  You can get better meat buying a SteakUm.  Then someone else tried it and choked on it cause it was just grissel. Some of the wait staff seemed nice, but our main waitress was unusual.  She said \"if you have any questions, don't ask\".  Someone at my table was like me, only verbally asked \"What?\" And she repeated \"any questions, don't ask\". She then walked away.  When the food came.  They just dropped it off and ran.  We had told them it was all of our first time eating Korean food.  The people here at yelp have been more helpful, I was able to tell what some of the items were.  Halfway through trying to chew the meat, one in my party asked what the items where.  We were told they \"are food\".  We all looked at each other like \"huh?\"  Then asked again, what are the items and made sure to add \"specifically\".  Finally then did someone point out what we were eating.   Overall I found the place way over priced.  I'd go back and try something out if someone else is willing to cover the cost, cause $75 for 2 items from this place is so not worth it."}
{"text":"Best place for Korean food in the area! The waiters are so nice and attentive, and the food is served quickly and hot. Big fan of the kalbi, spicy kalbi tang, and ojingoh bokkeum."}
{"text":"Went with my dad for a late lunch on a snowy afternoon, no other customers. Got hot tea immediately, a nice touch. The server was a friendly younger gentleman who did an excellent job, the only flaw was not getting tea refills quickly enough.   Korean food is something else -- check it out if you haven't tried it, and this is as good a place as any. We kept it simple -- I got bim be bop and Dad got a soup that came recommended by the server.  While it was a lot of food, a lot of it was rice and vegetables, which while delectable, was hard to justify at the price points (and yes, I know it includes all those wonderful appetizers.). It's in a wood-paneled old building in Parma, that doesn't bother me, but for the price of a nice meal downtown (some were $20-$30 a plate), that just seems hard to justify."}
{"text":"The portions here are huge! Very reasonably priced and attentive service. I was skeptical about going here due to the other rather mediocre Asian restaurants in the Cleveland area. The banchan portions are generous and all of the entrees were delicious and perfectly seasoned. I will definitely be coming back for more of the spicy beef stew and kalbi :)"}
{"text":"I took my two young daughters to Seoul Garden for lunch. They are 10 and 11. Our lunch started with 8 different kinds of banchan including seaweed salad, sprouts, pickled radish, bean curd, several kinds of kimchi and an egg dish. They were all good and refills are free. One daughter had miso soup and beef filled fried dumplings. The other had a bento-style lunch that included salad, rice, a dumpling, sesame flavored cellophane noodles and a nice serving of grilled salmon with a flavorful teriyaki sauce which the girls enjoyed mixing with the rice. I had a bulgogi bento which featured the same side items and a flavorful thin sliced beef marinated and grilled. All the food was excellent. The only complaint I could have was that the restaurant was very understaffed with only one server. He was running and hustling, and comped the soup without request because he felt it was late. We tipped him extra; he deserved it.  Seoul Garden is unassuming; it's not fancy nor expensive. But the food was very good and they also offer Hot Pot and tabletop grilling for fun communal dining experiences."}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Cleveland and was really craving Korean food. I got a tip about this place and decided to check it out. Wow! That is all I can say because I have no words for it. It was amazing!! I got my usual, kimchi jigae and it was so delicious! It was perfect. Their selection of banchan was fantastic as well. I just can't say enough good things about this place. It really made my trip complete. If you are in the Cleveland area and want some delicious, authentic Korean food...this is the place."}
{"text":"So I live pretty close to Seoul garden, and of course by me being a faithful yelper it came up on my close by restaurants so I initially went a month ago but because of their special holiday (forgot the name) it was closed.  I was looking forward because the pics from other reviews come to find,  did that place justice.  So I came back around 3:20 and had just missed the lunch special which sucked because the beef ribs were half off and I wanted to try them! : ( so instead me and my friends shared a seafood hot pot. Which turned out to be great!! and thank goodness for that because I almost walked out when I noticed a little fly in my water. Back to the food,  the broth had just the right about of heat to it, I'm a spice girl anyways so u know I could have always added more lol. The mussels,fish,crabs, and squid was of abundance so much that we pigged out and had plenty more for to go.  I have 3 starts because the fly in my water, luckily the food redeemed it!@"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I was very impressed. For lunch I ordered the spicy shrimp and it was so delicious.  Big portion as well,  I could only eat half.    The server was very friendly and kept us without needing anything.  Food came out tasty,  hot and quickly.  I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars. It is an experience, for sure. Excellent kimchi and the steamed egg dish was awesome! Unfortunately, they charge $3 for a refill, unlike the other free side dishes (which are refilled free). We asked the waiter for a recommendation, and followed it. I wish I had listened to other yelp reviews instead. At $22, the short rib barbecue is  definitely not worth ordering. The flavor was amazing but it was tough and sinewy. If we lived closer I would go back and try other things on the menu, but it isn't good enough to travel to eat here."}
{"text":"Super authentic yummy food! They have a huge menu and I highly recommend the rice cake appetizer, although be warned-- they're really spicy! They give you all of the entrées before hand including; fresh seaweed, kimchi, ginger, bean sprouts and so much more! I got the hot plate (it comes sizzling in a volcanic rock bowl) which is dressed with a big portion of veggies, rice and an egg yolk I can never seem to finish, and tastes just as yummy the second time. Also endless hot tea refills, say no more."}
{"text":"SO good and so much fun. The other reviews are spot on. The seafood pancake was my fav. followed by the Korean fried chicken. The side dishes are yummy as well - it's a ton of food."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav korean restaurants so far. I been traveled to Seoul and this one is even better than what I had there.  My recommendations are pancake and all tofu soups.  As long as you love spicy food, this is right place you need to go"}
{"text":"This place is everything. I haven't had good Korean food since I left Washington DC over a decade ago. I try every Korean place I come across because it's my favorite cuisines. When my friend had to tell me I needed to go to Parma for mind-blowing Korean food, I scoffed.   All of my favorites are on the menu, along with stuff I've never encountered. Everything I've tried has been cooked to perfection. The veggie pizza things are so delicious.... but be warned they are 'yuge and shall not be ordered as a side dish.   The Bibimbap in the stone bowl is so simple, yet it blows me away every time.   Go here. Go here often!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp i found this Gem my first experience with Korean food and it was so great we loved the food specially the sweet beans i was hooked the vegetable pancake was insanely good well actually everything. I must say the side dishes really help with the waiting. Only problem was that they were really full and its so small the place so you had to wait but it was worth the trip from Lorain and the wait. We will come back def"}
{"text":"We are Koreans and we have had Korean food in many US cities - LA, NY, Chicago, San Francisco.  What a surprise to find this excellent Korean restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio (Parma, to be exact).  It is a hidden gem! We were dropping off our daughter at college and we are so glad that we tried this place (we have come twice already!).  Hannah is a wonderful owner and her uncle used to be a chef at a restaurant in a NY hotel.  No wonder.  The banchan is plentiful and has a clean and fresh taste.  The galbi melts in your mouth and the soups are unbelievably delicious.  The ddukbokgi was wonderful - the dduk is so soft and the sauce was wonderful. We want to try every single dish on the menu. Cleveland/Parma - you are blessed to have this restaurant in your area.  We will have to make many excuses to visit our daughter so that we can eat at Seoul Garden."}
{"text":"Tip: call ahead for a reservation!  This place was a hidden gem when I had to travel to Cleveland for a work trip. This place is as authentic as it gets in a city like this. Visiting from a city where there's a large Asian population (Houston), I know when I'm eating good, authentic Korean food.  The service is great and friendly and the portions of all orders are huge! I've been here twice and it won't be the only times. I love the small side dishes that come with your orders and you can always ask for more.  What I've ordered: Kalbi: Order this. The beef is very tender and flavorful with a touch of that smokey taste. Ask for lettuce and create a small wrap with the kalbi, rice, and kimchi. Gahn Poong Gi: One of my favorite chicken dishes. The chicken is perfectly crispy on the outside and the sauce is awesome. Eat this with the pickled radish and you're in heaven. Kimchi Jjigae: Great for a cold night and if you love spices, this is the one to get. It comes boiling in a hot bowl with a ton of kimchi, assorted meats, and some noodles. I couldn't finish it all and took it home. Jaeyook Bokkeum: Spicy pork... OMG so good. The flavors just marry in your mouth and the pork is so tender. This is a must try!  Definitely one of my favorite places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Best korean restaurant in Cleveland... yet three stars. :(  The main thing I come here for is the gopchang (fried intensines) with some refreshing soju. The yukgaejang is also good, and usually get that too. The banchan selection is serviceable.   You probably should discount this review if you have never had k-food before, as I'm admittedly unrealistic in my expectations. I've been spoiled by growing up in LA, which allegedly has the best k-food in the world (including Seoul, which I believe). The owners are very nice, and do the best they can with such a large menu. And apparently yagu star Hee Seop Choi loves this place!"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of people and we reserved one of the big karaoke rooms. We had a family style meal, and all of the food that I tried was delicious. We had an assortment of meats, fried chicken, jigae, noodles, and Korean hot pot. The food was outstanding, and also very spicy. The service here was amazing! They brought us plenty of tea and water refills, and they made sure to give us more than enough of the banchan (side dishes). We also sang karaoke here, and the selection of songs was great, they had American pop, Chinese, and Korean music. They even had a disco ball in the karaoke room, so it felt like a party. I would definately recommend this place for some yummy food and fun karaoke."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find a great Korean restaurant here, coming from north jersey/NYC. The food is decently priced and portions are generous. The kimchi is amazing, and the soondubu is also delicious. My only complaints are that the seafood scallion pancake was definitely not as crispy as I would have liked it (a bit soggy, even) and the gomtang was a little watery and bland. Otherwise, the ban Chan were all delicious.   Tip: if you want to have samgyetang, you need to call in advance."}
{"text":"Seoul Garden Restaurant is hands down the best Korean restaurant in the Cleveland area. No other place gives you so many small side dishes or serve traditional Korean dishes and stews like my moms use to make. Seoul Garden might be the only Korean restaurant that allow you to cook your own meats at your own table, but the minimum order is 2 which is about enough for 4. A bit on the pricier side, but you definitely get what you pay for.   If it's your first time and you have trouble figuring out what to order, go ahead and order the galbi, which is the marinated short ribs, and the hot spicy tofu soup.  My only gripe about this place is that it seems to be open and closed on random days. So call ahead of time."}
{"text":"We went around 5pm on a Thursday, it was basically empty but within the hour the place had about 3 groups waiting for a table. So it does get pretty crowded. Server was very pleasant and started us with hot barley water. -Beef dumplings (mandu). Very nice flavor, but a bit greasy. Would order again. 3/5 -Seafood pancake (haemul pajeon). Very good! Not greasy, huge size, 8 large slices, would definitely order again 5/5 -Spicy rice cakes (ddeok bok ki). Very spicy. The rice cakes were very soft, fresh, and hot. Lots of other veg mixed in. 3/5 -Fried chicken (Khan poon gi). Large pile of fried chicken chunks dosed in a sweet and sour sauce with a kick of heat at the end. Reminded me of a Chinese food dish. Would order again 4/5 -Miso soup: a bit bland, way too much tofu. Would order again. 3/5 -Spicy octopus (nakji bokkeum): not spicy, a bit gooey, but yummy! Would order again. 4/5  The meal came with a ton of sides like potato, Kim chi, seaweed salad, spicy radish, sweet radish, spicy peppers, fish cake, spicy zucchini.  I would and do plan on returning here. We paid around $100 and 5 adults ate their full with lots of leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"This is the Korean restaurant that I bring guests to when they come to Cleveland and want Korean food.  For my money it is the best Korean food in CLE.  Love the quick service, generous banchan, yogurt shots at the end and awesome kalbi and bimbimbop.  Decor is nothing to be amazed at but this is a hole in the wall restaurant in Parma, not haute cuisine.  Wish the parking lot had more spaces but I can deal with that.  Wish this restaurant was closer to my house- I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"So I'm not a huge fan of most Asian fare, but my wife is... and that means I eat it a lot. That said, this place is pretty good. We ordered quite a few things off the menu and everything was at least decent and the portions were pretty big. I guess the only negative is the location(Parma is not my ideal location in NE Ohio) and the decor; they really need to invest in some new tables, or at least tablecloths. Most likely will come back."}
{"text":"Great food great price, every time I'm in Cleveland for work I swing by. Some of the best Korean food I've had.    For the non Koreans or non Korean food eaters, the menus in the restaurant have English descriptions and pictures, you also can order by the items number (this is very normal). Also normally food is served as quite a large portion and with side dishes (if you have food allergies ask first). The outside location does not look like much, again normal. First timers I'd recommend Bibimbap (use the hot sauce and oil and mix everything up) and ddeok gook ki."}
{"text":"First time experiencing Korean food and it was very tasty!  I had a wonderful soup with short ribs, green onions and other veggies and egg.  The broth was mild.  I cannot recall the name of it!  The small side dishes were amazing and are included in your meal.  A word of caution for anyone looking for a typical Americanized Chinese menu.  This isn't the place!  Korean food is different from other Asian fare.  It's hearty, and spicy.  Though it doesn't have to be.  They use egg and beef liberally, plus garlic and chilis.  It's delicious, but not your typical Asian cuisine that most Americans are used to!  If you are an adventurous eater, or want to broaden your culinary horizons I highly suggest a trip to this charming hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I'm originally from LA so I missed and craved the authentic flavors of restaurants that specialize in tofu soups! (Soondubul, sundobu, or however it's really spelled.)  I tried the tofu soup here and was very disappointed! It had no flavor. It was just spicy hot water with tofu.  The banchan at the beginning of the meal was excellent and the yakult at the end of the meal was a nice treat so I will give this one 3 stars.   I will go back again to try the bibimbap or the bulgogi to see if I can give this place a higher rating. So until next time..."}
{"text":"Upon entering you will be greeted with a glass of warm barley(?) tea.. And welcome smiles (quite uncommon in Korean restaurants) then after perusing the vast menu (recommended the seafood pajheon and fried chicken) you will meet an endless array of bachan, which believe me, are different everytime we go.   Food always comes super fast and always good! The ddok buk gi appetizer is big so there will always be extras for dinner and lunch the next day. In fact all entrees are big and will not disappoint . After enjoying your food, the best part of the experience (for us) is the Yakult dessert!!! Way better than the usual oranges or fortune cookies ... All in all after consistently visiting this place for a whole month straight, i must say this is one of the best place to have Korean food in Ohio!"}
{"text":"Reading Amanda B.'s review reminded me of my own disastrous experience here recently. I have been to Seoul Garden three times. The first was really delicious- to the point I wondered how it had been that I had never had Korean before. I raved about it to my husband and we brought a friend there a couple of months later. It was still pretty good, but a definite decline from my first time.   The friend we brought suggested we all go there again when her grandparents were in town. To be blunt, I have never been so embarrassed by a restaurant in all my life. The waiter was clearly inexperienced and his English abilities were probably not what they should be, but the restaurant was not so busy that the service should have been THAT bad. We got our food in waves. He \"forgot\" the soup over and over again. I had to ask for silverware for the table so many times that I eventually got up and went to the back and got it myself. It was completely obvious that the Korean customers in the place got priority over our table of six Caucasians. I saw several tables get all of their food, finish, pay and leave before we even got half of our food. We never got refills on our drinks. It took forever for us to get proper plates and bowls. By the time two of us got our clay pot entrees, every one else had long finished their entrees. The food was edible, but again, a big step down from my first experience and we were all so pissed off that even if it had been the greatest food on the planet we wouldn't have known due to all the bitterness grown of frustration and annoyance. If anyone knows of a Korean restaurant that gives a shit about keeping customers, let me know."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot; we all left satisfied!!! Beef, rice, vegetables and everything in between... this is Parma's best kept secret! They have good spicy sauce too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really hard to find now if you're coming here for the first time. I recently moved back to Cleveland after a year and I almost missed this place while getting there on Pearl Rd. I think they removed the store sign now, so it looks like an abandoned/nondescript small store next to some car lots.  My friends and I like to come here for the lunch special (weekdays only). Unfortunately, the prices have gone up, quite significantly by about $1-3 if I remember correctly. The lunch special choices are pretty extensive, from KBBQ lunch boxes to various stews to yakisoba/udon. (See pictures of menus) The KBBQ lunch boxes come with some japchae, rice, your bbq meat and a dumpling. I LOVE that they give you a box of banchan to take home if you get the lunch specials to go! Of course, it's not all 10+ dishes, but it's still a nice touch to get ~5 of them.  What I do like is that regardless of whether you come here by yourself, you will get the same number of banchan dishes as anyone else, so they don't skimp out on them if you're by yourself! I love the acorn jelly, kimchi, potatoes, radish kimchi, anything really. The side dishes vary by day, but you can rest assured that you will always get napa cabbage kimchi.  This time, I got the kimchi chigae, which came with kimchi, pork, tofu and some rice cakes. It was tasty and came literally boiling hot to my table, but spice + heat act synergistically so I really couldn't eat it until it cooled down a bit.  Anyway, when you come here, you should bring a friend and just order one entree. One time, my friend and I came here for dinner and ordered 3 things (1 appetizer, 2 entrees) since we were starving and thought it was appropriate. Well, we took home more than half of it. We also looked ridiculous with all the plates taking up a table meant for 4.  The service here is FANTASTIC. The server brings you more banchan before you even ask, and periodically checks up on you. And will help you package leftovers (like my kimchi chigae). And when you have too much food to bring home, he opens the door for you too. Which has happened more than once..."}
{"text":"My spot every other Friday on payday hahaha my girl and I love this place, appetizer alone is best, soup in the winter is awesome especially the spicy soup #62 to be exact lol"}
{"text":"What a gem this place is in the middle of Parma. The short ribs are the best, bibimbap also good."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean food in Cleveland! Like others have said, it's a smaller, hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The waitress is hardworking and polite. I went with a larger group (8) on a Sunday afternoon, and she was tackling everything by herself.   We were thinking about doing Korean BBQ but it might have been a little much for a Sunday lunch, so this is what we went with instead:  Panchan: small appetizer dishes (comes with the meal) were plentiful and they also gave us steamed egg. They were so tasty.  Dduk bokki: Rice cakes in a spicy sauce with veggies.  They were different than the ones that usually come out -- these ones were longer and softer. Good flavor! It was such a big dish. Each person got 1-2 large rice cakes.  Pajeon: seafood pancake. This was huge! As big as a large pizza!! I thought it was really, really delish. It was really hearty and packed full of seafood.  Galbi: If you're looking for a meat to try, this is definitely the one to order if you're new to Korean food. As my boyfriend says, out of all the Asian cuisine, Koreans really know how to do their meat. I didn't eat any (pescetarian) but it looked and smelled good.   Japchae: Vermicelli noodles with tons of veggies! I think there were almost too many veggies and not enough noodles. I could eat this forever though...  Boodae jigae: \"junk food stew\"! Ordered by some of our Korean American friends. I learned that because of the war in Korea (which had decimated much of Korea), a lot of people had to make do. So, they used American processed foods from US Army bases and created a stew with kimchi, hot dogs, spam, ramen, and other things in gochujang (red spicy sauce). This one also had tofu in it, which was very yummy. It was fairly spicy, fyi!  Super pro: yakult yogurt shots at the end!!  The con: we did end up waiting for our food for what seemed like a long time (esp the banchan appetizers), but we got that resolved quickly with the waitress."}
{"text":"Indeed best Korean food in the Cleveland area - both the price and portions. We went there on a random night hoping for some good Korean food. A little bit doubtful when we first stepped in because not too many people were eating there, but the food itself proved us wrong.  Got a rice cake appetizer, but it came out in a giant plate and turned our appetizer into one of the main course. In addition, they also provide tiny plates of Korean appetizers. We were practically full with just the appetizers!  For main course we got Galbi, which came out on a hot plate. Although it wasn't sizzling, but it was still warm. Not the best galbi ever, but decent for the Cleveland area. Also got japchae (korean vermicilli with veggies). That was pretty good because it had a lot of veggies. Also got a spicy squid, which also came with veggies. It was definitely very saucey. If you food with a lot of sauce on it, this is the dish to go for. Although we spent about 60 dollars total for 3 main courses and 1 appettizer, it lasted us 2+ meals total. Definitely BIG portions for the price.  They also have raw meat where they grill for you on the spot. We saw some Korean gentlemen in the store, and they ordered those raw meat to be grilled on the spot. Since they ordered it, I am guessing it must be the \"right\" way to go. Next time I am going to try that too. I think it's worth the drive even if you live downtown Cleveland. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Gopdol Bibim Bop - amazing! If you want to try something different, new, fresh- this is the place. They brought out 8 different vegetables for me to try out as an appetizer. Truly amazing.   This is one of those restaurants that focuses in making great food above anything else."}
{"text":"The food and environment at this place felt more like I was at someone's house than a restaurant. Yes, the space is small but the decorations and delicious food made everything feel suuuper homey :)   The banchan came not long after we were seated. Their array of banchan is sooo delicious, and the servers kept coming back to ask if we wanted more refills. I loved the potatoes and the radish dishes the most. Both were the perfect pre-game meal for what was about to come :) For the main entrees, we ordered kalbi, spicy lamb casserole hot pot, and seafood pancake. The kalbi is hands down the best one I've had outside of Koreatown in Los Angeles. The dish was perfectly sweet and savory. It went great with the interesting dipping sauce the restaurant provided! The lamb casserole hot pot is extremely SPICY! But I'm a huge fan of spicy, so try it if you dare! The lamb was tender and soaked up the flavors really well. I'm not sure what vegetable they had in the hot pot, but it was a bit bitter, which goes well with the spice level and lamb. You won't believe how ENORMOUS the seafood pancake is! It's seriously like a pizza!! But more delicious of course! It had less seafood bits in it than I preferred, but still really worth a try! After you ask for the check, the servers come around with the tiny yogurt drinks! It's the perfect post-feast treat!   Service here is also top notch. Why? All the servers speak English!! Omgsh you would not believe how much trouble I've had in the past with non-English speaking servers. Plus, they were extremely friendly and attentive!   Two thumbs (and big toes) up for Seoul Garden!"}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for a year, and this place is definitely the real deal. The kimchi jjigae was hearty and generous, with lots of pork and ddeok. They also gave banchan (side dishes) to go, which is unusual for Korean restaurants in the States. I got carryout this time around, but I'll be going back sometime to try the BBQ and some other dishes. Glad to have a Korean food source close to home!"}
{"text":"I drove by today for the first time, stopped in, and had an outstanding lunch! Bi Bim Bap was 8.95. Came with a great selection of ban chan which was impressive since it was only lunchtime. Also came with the steamed egg which was delicious. Service was excellent. I'm in love with this place and am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"You must go at lunch and try the \"box\" lunch. They offer bulgogi beef, teriyaki chicken, salmon, and other options. It is served on a divided plate with a dumpling, rice, glass noodle, your entree, and a salad with ginger dressing. You still get all the little bowls of sides like kimchee, pickled radish, seaweed, and fish cake. It's a great deal for $10.95! So delicious. Service is attentive but they do get busy!"}
{"text":"Came here when I visited my big bro. Since it's rare to find any Korean restaurants in the Cleveland/Akron area, I was happy to pay the higher prices as compared to LA, where I'm from. The food was great and the service good. And I even saw that Shin Soo Choo had visited and signed a shirt on the wall! :-)"}
{"text":"Great evening on a cold night. The banchan was tasty and service was very fast. The main dishes were perfect, the right size to split between two.  Plenty of items on the menus to choose from. We drove from Lake County on a snowy night for some great Korean food.  Nothing fancy on the inside... Just like typical mom and pop places who pay more attention to the food then decor.  Enjoy  Pjmwinnie, painesvile  Oh"}
{"text":"I'm from cities where authentic Korean is easily accessible so when I moved to Akron I thought that I would have to travel all the way to Cle for some good food, until I found this gem. Delicious, simply delicious. Great staff & service. If anything, I just wish the portions were a tad larger for the price. Will go back monthly-ish."}
{"text":"We drove from a distance excited to eat here but when we arrived at 8:30 pm we were turned away by a waiter that was eating at a table. We knew the restaurant closed at 9 but we got lost. I didn't expect the waiter to turn us away but he did. Clearly we had inconvenienced him during his meal time. Too bad for us, the place smelled great but the service stank, sorry to say."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything we ate. It was fairly priced. Friendly and helpful waitress. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"First time here and it was absolutely amazing!   Went here with a group of friends and we did the BBQ and ordered some appetizers. I ordered the spicy rice cakes and it was deliiiicious. It was nice and spicy, just the way I like it. The rice cakes were actually rice cakes, I've had some from other places and at Seoul, it topped it all. For Korean BBQ, we ordered the Galbi and Bulgogi. They were both marinated already so the taste was naturally great. There were plenty of banchan i think 13 side dishes, with the BBQ it came with the steamed egg, rice, lettuce, everything. Our table of 4 was stacked with food everywhere. Food tasted great and after the meal, they brought out cute little sweet milk juggies. I had them when I was a little kid and it definitely balanced the palate.    The decor of the place is pretty cute and not as shabby as it looks outside. It's a small place so I'm thinking it can fill about 50 people only. This would be a great place to come with a group of friends or go on a date. It would be nice if they had a back room for karaoke too lol"}
{"text":"What a gem in Parma! If you haven't been here, you must go even if just for the experience. There is a nice selection of dishes and the sides were great! I had the seafood bibimbop which was pretty good. My husband had a fried chicken dish which unfortunately was not so great. The sauce was great but we weren't sure if we were eating actual chicken or just over-fried dough.  I would definitely go back just to sample more dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a former Clevelander and was in town over July 4th visiting an old friend.  We were looking for an interesting lunch place, and I found Seoul Garden on Yelp.  Best ratings of any of the Korean restaurants.  My friend poo-pooed it, saying that \"all the best Korean places are downtown.\"  He was eating crow a few hours later!  The smell was so amazing before we'd even stepped inside the restaurant,  he turned to me and said, \"You were right.\"  LOL!  Not a pretty restaurant by any means, it really looks like a hole in the wall.  But the galbi and bulgogi were amazing!  The huge assortment of salads (banchan) were delicious and our waiter (a sweetheart) offered us seconds.  On top of everything, the price was so reasonable, if I lived in Cleveland, I'd be eating out here every week!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in town.  Family owned and cared for, the service is top notch and friendly!  Ask for a Korean seafood pancake!  I had just about every dish and you will not be hungry afterwards!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place been coming here for the past 2 years and it's always so good, the staff is super friendly and the food is always awesomely good. If you're looking for authentic korean food this is def the place to go."}
{"text":"First time eating Korean and it was amazing! Bring your appetite. Each dish comes with little side dishes yep dishes about 7 for each order and a steamed egg! The yogurt shot at the end is another taste bud pleasing experience! The Eel dish and seafood pancake were out if this world. The seafood pancake is the side of a medium pizza so bring a friend or three to share this yummy experience with!"}
{"text":"We had the private room last minute for 15 people. The food was amazing, server was awesome. Loved the seafood Pancake, gal  bi, spicy pork, potstickers, spicy octopus. Soju was delicious and cold. Can't say enough to good things. Go here and don't be intimidated by ambiance!"}
{"text":"I think when you go with high expectations, a lot of time it doesn't take much to be disappointed. A little bit of research would have helped in the selection process.  The place was crowded for lunch and the service was efficient for the one person scampering between tables.  The appetizers are part of the lunch menu however it can't be shared, so a party of two will have to order two main entree to be able to get the starter package but if one walks in alone then there no problem getting the same starter with one order from main entree.  Any how we went ahead and ordered two main entree. one from the lunch menu and the other with the dinner menu.   The starters were okay and that itself was a full course.  The quantity I should say is humongous for even the lunch portion and will need a box especially after eating the starters. Or else post lunch siesta is a guarantee.  The dinner entree filled my stomach just looking at it and reminded me of the seven sin especially gluttony. Why does one need to up charge an order of triple deep fried corn starch batter with tiny hidden pieces of chicken for $20 and give it a fancy name. I wish I had a prescription of Lipitor handy. Even though Korean fried chicken was labeled spicy, it was sweet as any dessert can be.   I must agree the food was piping hot and the bibimbap vegetarian was delicious.   After an underwhelming encounter not sure if I would venture out of my way to this place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the area a few weeks ago. We stopped in at this little mom&pop joint with a craving for Korean food. We ordered the Ddukbokkie (spicy rice cakes), Bi Bim Bap (bon chon + ground beef over rice), and Soondubu Jigae (spicy seafood tofu soup). Everything was hands down delicious. The bon chon, everything! I'm normally spoiled by my native hometown's cuisine (Bay Area, California), and this place made me forget that I was in Ohio and made me feel right at home in California!   Waitress was attentive and courteous, and the staff was very friendly in greeting us when we came in and left.  Note: This review is my opinion based on my experience only and may not reflect on the business as a whole. What experience I had may not be the same for someone else."}
{"text":"For my first experience with Korean food, I am absolutely positive it probably could not have been any better than here... the staff were extremely friendly, the food was absolutely scrumptious, and the price was ridiculously reasonable!  Eat here!"}
{"text":"First time here great food no complaints. Very nice lady who mentioned her mom owned it at one time was our waitress My father and I enjoyed it al besides the little sides. But not because it was bad food we just did not like kimchee the other foods as it was new to us. Nice and spicy the rice noodle sticks were AMAZING must get. I'm not feeling a long review on this but please go give it a try.I looked at a lot of reviews and photos and wrote down the names of the dishes that looked good to me we got  jaeyook and the deik bok gi and my dad got a shrimp dish but I don't know the name of it"}
{"text":"Driving on Pearl Road, looking for a well reviewed Korean restaurant, you'll inevitably pass this place by.  The outside is dark and unwelcoming: not the kind of place one might expect to find kindly service, a clean atmosphere, and some fantastic food.  I recommend looking passed the potholes in the parking lot, sitting down and making an adventure out of a great selection of delicious Korean foods."}
{"text":"Just moved to Cleveland from Seattle, and was really craving Korean food, this place is by far the best I've had so far, staff is really friendly, prices are fair and food is incredible ,the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I am pretty picky with asian food, and this place satisfies my cravings. I love their little side dishes too. The potato salad is all my fav! There food is also great, they are the only Korean place i go to eat at.  There prices are fair and the portions are right. All and all I really enjoy this place!  They are closed on Mondays though!"}
{"text":"I love the weekday lunch specials here!  I wish they would open on Mondays, since it's a trek out to Parma for us, and it would be great to go after a visit to the zoo on Mondays.  The spicy kalbi tong is great, and they have a wide array of bon chon (side dishes that come with the meal), including steamed egg.  Some people say that you can judge a Korean restaurant by the bon chon, and if that seems consistent with this place.  The soon doobu (tofu soup) is only so so, with tiny broken pieces of tofu and too much zucchini and onion as filler, which typically isn't in the dish at all.  The flavor is good, but they only offer one variety, where most places offer many (like beef, oyster, seafood, etc.)"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the area! I am a newly converted Korean food addict and this really got me going. Wonderful authentic selections with all the accompaniments you would want. Also provide free barley tea and a yogurt drink with your check.   Should have taken more photos but was too busy enjoying the meal with vigor :)"}
{"text":"Really authentic Korean and my favorite in Cleveland. Awesome selection of banchan (yes, there is steamed egg) and BBQ. I've been here a handful of times and the food was excellent with great consistency. Their tofu soups and bulgogi are my favorites here. Soups were always bubbly hot and packed with flavor and the bulgogi is nicely seasoned. The bulgogi sauce has the right amount of sweetness and spice. I've also tried their spicy octopus, kalbi, bibimbap, and among a few other things. What I haven't had here is their DIY BBQ. But judging from other customers and the aroma it creates, I have no doubt that it's as delicious as their kitchen plates!  The restaurant walls are covered with pine (\"What is this? knotty pine!?\" - AHS), kinda feels like a sauna in there. The place appears to be family run and the staff here works pretty nonstop. As with many Korean restaurants, you end the meal with yogurt drink."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!!  I've been here twice now and each time I left very full and very happy.  This is authentic Korean food served in a good quantity by a very attentive and welcoming wait-staff.  We first went here on our anniversary and we had the bulgogi and a tofu stew. Both were really good and I liked the variety of their banchan.  However, the second time we came was what really sealed it for me.  That second time, we decided to do a \"cook-out\" (where you cook the meat at your table on a hot plate).  The meat came thinly sliced and looked very fresh.  The server explained the sauces to us and how to wrap the veggies around the cooked meat and then it was off to the races!  My husband doesn't like to cook and doesn't cook much at home, but place meat and fire in front of him and watch the caveman come alive! :)  He sprang to action, cooking that meat almost as quickly as we could stuff it into our mouths.  I swear we didn't say a single word to each other for like 20 minutes: why waste time talking when you could be chewing?  The meat was that tasty!    This isn't a five-star restaurant because the decorations are rather humble; but the food is definitely five-star!  And oh, good bonus for location: there is a frozen yoghurt place just up the road.  After stuffing our face with beef, my husband and I stuck to our diet and got frozen yoghurt rather than ice-cream.  It's all about the compromise. ;)"}
{"text":"When ever we're in town, we head to Seoul Garden. We ordered their o jing obukum which was excellent. Just make sure that the piece of squid is not a piece of onion and you'll be ok. Their KFC, Korean Fried Chicken, is also very good. It's not greasy, but possibly could stand a little less delicious sauce to preserve the satisfying crunch. You're also presented with a a large assortment of banchan!"}
{"text":"I happened to read some reviews on Yelp about Korean restaurants in Cleveland and saw that this place has the highest overall rating.   I had visited this place years ago and I wasn't impressed back then. So I have decided to re-visit this restaurant. When I visited on a Thursday night, it was already crowded. Although the waitress gave us a prompt attention, we were sitting there for like 20 min before she came around to take our order. But she was very pleasant and efficient in service.  First arrived were 11 side dishes plus Gyeranjjim (Korean Style Steamed Egg Casserole). Side dishes were pretty fresh and most of them tasted just perfect. Taste of Gaeranjim was pretty much first class! Considering that I am Korean and therefore have a discerning taste, I think what they do with side dishes here is phenomenal.  We ordered two dishes.  Jaeyook-Kimchi-Bokum(Spicy Pork and Kimchi Stirfry) and Chopchae(Clear Korean Noodles with Beef and Vegetables).  Chopchae wasn't too well made. It was too oily, and perhaps too swollen. I was disappointed with that. On the other hand, Jaeyook-Kimchi-Bokum was just amazing and out of this world. It was perfectly spicy, with rightly seasoned pork, and kimchi (stir-fried). I think this is the joy of Korean food eating. Let me describe the sensations here for those who may not be familiar with the art of tasting spicy food.  Pork that is spicy (and  a little sweetly seasoned) enough to tantalize your taste bud, and then the stir fried kimchi attacking your tongue and lips to make you experience that hot tingle and burn. Yes, often, it makes you sweat like a pig to tell you the truth. Your mouth is going to have to be strong enough to withstand the attack of the spiciness, but when you do overcome it, it comes with such an exciting arousal in your taste bud. Finally, your body will succumb to the wave of pleasurable feelings from your mouth, and this will propagate through all over the body.  My friend was totally impressed with both dishes and, in a hurry, got stuffed in his belly with delicious food. The portions were huge, therefore, we could not finish them all even though we were so stuffed. Well there is a way out of this dilemma. We got doggy bags each and merrily we headed out.   I have to warn you, though. After filling your stomach with wonderful Korean food, all of a sudden, a drowsiness attacks you. This I believe is experiencing the high due to the rapid rise of blood sugar level (sugar from rice). And in combination with the high of tasting great food, this can lead you to a comma state. YES, all of a sudden, I felt I am falling into a state of coma. But, being a master of self-control, I was able to wake up and face the reality of driving home away from the palace of gourmet food.  Yes, I said Choopchae wasn't that great. But I really don't care. I must give this restaurant a five star for allowing me to experience a TRANCE state of dining if there is such a thing.  Although I just don't want to be an addict to food, I know I shall be returning to this restaurant very soon !"}
{"text":"Seoul Garden is situated in a sketchy looking area. Was a bit scared to stop and eat at this restaurant, but I'm glad I gave it a go.   Seoul Garden has a nice, humble interior. Waitress/waiter are courteous & quick. I love that steamed egg comes out as a side dish among 5-6 other sides.  Ordered the tangsooyook, kahmppongi & the yookgaejang. I kind of regret getting both the tangsooyook & kahmppongi cause they're basically the same thing except one isn't spicy. I'm not sure if it was because the batter was bad or if they re-fried leftovers, but both of the dishes had a weird \"crunch\" to them. The flavoring was good, but I didn't like the staleness. Yookgaejang, on the other hand, was amazing! We're so glad we opted for it in the last minute.   I'm hoping I came on an off day. Unfortunately- I'm not in this area quite often so I don't think I'll be able to give Seoul Garden another go."}
{"text":"I took two colleagues here who have never had Korean food before, and they absolutely loved this place!  For variety, we shared 4 dishes family-style: the seafood pancake, kahm poong gi (sweet & spicy fried garlic chicken - the favorite dish of the night), dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice in a sizzling stone pot), and galbi (sweet marinated beef short ribs). Needless to say...along with the 10 free bonchon dishes, we had a HUGE amount of leftovers to bring back home. We had no regrets though, because each dish was delicious!!  Overall, the prices are a bit high, as most Korean restaurants are, but the portion sizes are generous and the service is great."}
{"text":"YELPERS have this one right.  Best Korean restaurant in Cleveland.  All the other restaurants have issues but Seoul Garden is about as authentic as you're going to get if you enjoy typical Korean dishes (soups and rice dishes).  If you want K-BBQ it's average but you're not going to get great K-BBQ in Cleveland.  Service is  excellent and the hot tea is brewed perfectly and side dishes are above average.  Again, this is Cleveland people...not Cali.  I had the Rick cake soup and it was rock solid.  Broth was a consistent bone taste vs watery like most restaurants.  Dumpling was Store bought but certainly tasty.  The meat was sliced in strips and very tasty (very little fat).  I've been to South Korea and the Rick cake soup here is almost as good as Seoul.  Now go get some healthy soup for your soul!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Korean eatery in Cleveland.  I first thought that the prices were a bit high but... It was because of couple things: 1. The ban chan (side dishes) were free and unlimited including the rice.  2.  They don't skim on the quantity... Meat included.  If you are craving some down right Korean home cooking... And you live in Cleveland where there are 15 Korean people. Goto Seoul!"}
{"text":"I found this place based on good yelp reviews, and I was very happy with my meal. It's kind of a small place, but very welcoming and the people are very friendly.  The meal starts off with Korean appetizer dishes, including Kimchee, bean sprouts, potato, root vegetables, etc. We had 10 different sides plus a hot pot of egg.  I ordered Kimchee jigae, my fiancé had dol sot bibimbap. Our bowls of food were delicious, hot, and a large portion. Very well worth the money. In fact this place is one of the most reasonably priced Korean restaurants I've been to.  Highly recommend. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. Everything wonderful that you'd expect from a family-owned and run restaurant -- a very warm welcome. Looking for decor? Don't bother (unless you're nostalgic for your basement recreation room -- very Parma, I imagine). What you'll find here instead is good prepared well with good service. I might note that service on the front end -- help with the menu -- is especially good. Folks next to me had never had Korean food before and were not made to feel ignorant.  Happy to recommend Seoul Garden to others."}
{"text":"This unassuming place is easily overlooked or judged in its decor. But having lived in NE China for a year in a city with a thriving Korean population and having visited South Korea a number of times I can say their food is authentic and delicious. I try to go every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was excellent! Clean, well vented and great service also!!!  Started with shrimp Shumai and had the bim bop."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sundubu Jigae very much. Was prepared spicy and without egg as requested. Pretty heavy on the onions, less zucchini than many others I've tried. Soft tofu had pretty much exploded into very small bits, but the broth was delicious and squid not overcooked. Eight banchan plus the steamed egg Gaeranjim. Yakut (yogurt like drink).  Service quick, cleanliness good enough. (Bathroom is run down and in need of repairs. Two minutes of dusting would really help, but the sink, toilet, light switch, etc. had been cleaned recently.)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for Korean food in the Cleveland area. Clean environment. Friendly and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Wow! Other reviews were right, you would never know there was a restaurant here, looks kind of abandoned. The parking lot was recently top coated  and was neat and spacious. Inside was clean and homey. Barley tea was brought right out upon seating. My daughter and I liked it, my son did not care for it. Not sure why all the comments about lack of service. We had three different people bring drinks, refilling tea, refilling Banchan, asking if we had any questions, etc. All were very kind and helpful. I had Kalbi which has a wonderful flavor, but the meat was quite fatty and gristly. Kind of disappointment as it was expensive I felt at $20.95. My son had Spicy Fried Chicken with ground garlic and hot peppers at $17.95. The portion was enormous and very tasty. My daughter had the Seafood Bibim Bop ($15.95) which she liked very much. We all loved the Banchan which included Kimchi, fishcake, cucumber kimchi (I think it was called), marinated bean sprouts, radish kimchi, seaweed salad, potatoes, some sort of black beans, glass noodles ? that tasted of sesame, dried tofu and a soup with steamed egg. All were delicious. We devoured most of it before our meal came. Total including tip came to $71. something which I thought was very expensive. Definitely a treat type of meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm relatively new to Korean food, and driving up to this humble-looking restaurant gave me some pause, but the food was fantastic.  The Yelp Cleveland average of 4.5 stars with 50+ reviews does not lie: I've only been to a few of the already-limited Korean options in Cleveland, but the comments that Seoul Restaurant (or is it Seoul Garden?) has the best Korean food in the Cleveland-area are unsurprising.    I thought the galbi was pretty good, but the pizza-sized seafood pancake (the name unfortunately escapes me) was excellent.  The accompanying side dishes (banchan) were more plentiful and varied than I've had elsewhere, highlighted by the steamed egg which was superb in its simplicity.  The only extra thing I missed were the little fish."}
{"text":"You can totally tell it used to be an office of some sort. But don't let that dissuade you from this great place. The prices are a bit steep, but the food is great and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Hmmm...Did I catch them on an off night? I got take out...(Would that be the issue?) And upon initial inspection that is a TON of food. (YAY!!!)  But I get home and everything is VERY cold...Wondered if it was suppose to be served cold thats how cold it was. Also...BLAND!!!!! The veggies were too sweet and the serving of shredded beef was very tiny... Last note...Expensive... Will try again to see if last visit was an anomaly..."}
{"text":"We order a BBQ beef and thought we will be grilling the meat at our table like most other Korean places. However, it came in a hot plate and the quantity was definitely not worth of $18 or so.   Yet, the rice cake is very very good and a huge portion. The sauce they cook it with was amazing! Definitely try that!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I recommend everything the menu has to offer; you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to retry Seoul Garden and I have to say that I was very impressed.  Ever since Seoul Hot Pot closed I have been looking for a go to place for Korean food and I have to say I was suprised to find it in Parma.  The outside looks a bit run down, but once you get inside you will find a clean, warm and friendly restaurant.  The dining room is a couple of rows of tables in a wood paneled room, almost feels like eating in a paneled basement.  Service is attentive, you will be greeted, seated and given the barley tea with a nice nutty flavor.  The menu is extensive, with Korean and Japanese items; I ordered the the Seafood Bibim bap.  The meal starts with a nice selection of banchan, the small dishes of kim chi, pickles and other appetizers, some hot, some salty and some slightly sweet.  Next out is the small red hot pot with the best scrambled eggs you will ever taste, fluffy clouds of eggs; just be careful not to burn your mouth.  I have not gotten these at any other Cleveland Korean restaurant and it is a great item, especially to use to counter the spicey hot items.    Finally we get to the Seafood Bibim Bap, a hot pot filled with rice, shrimps, squid, scallops and then topped with vegetables and a raw egg.  Add in the peppery miso hot sauce and stir to complete the cooking of the items and you have a delicious meal that will satisfy your seafood cravings.   With a generous portion in the bibim bap along with all the other items, you will end up full and well satisfied.  With the bill they serve the chilled yogurt shot to give you a sweet ending to your meal.  I did want to mention that all of the food was beautifully presented, it is a real pleasure to have the food be a feast for the eyes before being a feast for your mouth. If you are seeking some excellent Korean food head South to Parma and give Seoul Garden a try."}
{"text":"-0.5 star because they ran out of Gom Tang/oxtail soup at 3PM + I know Korean restaurants that provide you side kimchi for free, but this one charged $5.00 just for a small box of Kimchi.  5 stars, however,  because the American-born asian waitress was super nice and helpful. She also didn't charge me for an extra bowl of rice, for a reason I forgot. The tea here is also great. The side dishes are free if you want extras.   The atmosphere is pretty cute and comfy. I see a lot of different Asians come in, so it's not just Koreans, of course. I may come back next time. :) I got a pretty good impression."}
{"text":"I would rate this a 3.5.  Don't let the outside look and area scare you off.  Nothing to look at inside or out, but you're there to eat.  There was a very diverse and tasty banchan selection.  Really liked them all and they brought about 10 different things.  Nice.  Shumai  to start was good and just like any other korean place.  I had the hot bowl bi bim bop.  They never have much meat by design, but this one seemed a little light.  The hot pepper sauce was tasty but not hot at all.  I ended up adding a whole bowl.  Overall this dish was fine.  Nothing spectacular and a bit bland compared to my top korean places but still good.  Gf had the seafood pahn jun.  This thing was huge!  It was a little doughy in the middle but that did not drag it down.  It was very fresh seafood in it and even the calamari was just right.  The setvice was not what im used to.  Food came quickly but hard to get someone for drink refills and the check. Not from the area so perhaps this is the best korean in Cleveland.   It's solid korean, just not worthy of 4 or 5 stars in my experience.   But give them a shot."}
{"text":"Easily the best Korean in Cleveland.  Good service, great food, homely decor (in a good way).  Don't let the exterior fool you, Seoul Garden brings it.  I've had the Dolsot Bibimbap, Tteokbokki, and the Bulgogi.   I've had the bibimbap many times and the unique mixture hits the spot every time.  The tteokbokki sauce was perfect; sweet, spicy, and savory. The bulgogi however was below average. Too many veggies, and the meat just tasted like your average beef stir fry, missing that unique marinade.  Where they really bring it is the banchan, aka the many Korean side dishes.  I'm talking plates upon plates of fresh banchan.  Different kinds of kimchi, spicy anchovies, some kind of potato, and other things.... all of which were very good.  You also get this scrambled egg concoction in a little hot pot that might be my favorite part of the entire meal.  You could probably get full off the banchan alone and a bowl of rice.  Lastly, you get a free bottle of Yakult as dessert.  If you're not Asian, this is a small serving of this sweet yogurt like milk.  If you are Asian, you might remember finishing entire packs of these in one sitting as a kid.  The bill might be a little steep for a little place like this, but Korean food is not typically cheap so expect to pay $10-$15 per head.  Seoul Garden is a hidden gem in a block full of worn down buildings and businesses."}
{"text":"I am by no means an expert on Korean food but have friends who are that love this place.  It is worth thirty minute drive from the East side.  My favorite dish by far was the seafood soup.  The flavors were layered and the perfect blend of savory richness.  I could eat that soup every week especially in the winter.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying the Korean fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I lived with a Korean roommate for a year, so I like to pretend I know good Korean food when I eat it. I've had great Korean BBQ in Chicago and this place is the next best thing. Definitely my favorite of the Korean places I've been to in Cleveland. It's family-owned and the atmosphere is very homey.   - Banchan is a good selection and they will bring out more if you run out (although this has never happened to me because I always order too much food). My favorite is the steamed egg, ugh, so good.   - The BBQ: you have a choice between pork belly and beef. They will bring out the grill and put it on your table (not like other Korean BBQ restaurants where the grill is built into the table). The beef (on the menu it says for 2 people) is more for 3-4 people especially when you're ordering moar food. It comes with lettuce and delicious dipping sauces. Fun to cook! The last time I came here with friends and we all looked pretty helpless/overwhelmed so a Korean mom who worked there cooked the meat for us, lol.  - Must try: Seafood pajeon (the best pajeon/pancake I've ever eaten and it's huge), Soondubu Jigae (hot spicy soup with tofu and seafood), Ddukbokkie (rice cakes in a spicy sauce).   - You will most likely leave the place with a stomach ache from overeating but it's worth it. The prices are very reasonable given the quantity and quality of food. Come with a large group!"}
{"text":"Banchan-Check Mackerel-Check Bulgogi-Check Lava hot soup-Check  Get there."}
{"text":"Absolutely as good as it gets.  I went twice in one week.  No skimpy three little banchan.  Each time we were given at least eight little dishes and there were differences on each day.  I know absolutely none of the names of any of the dishes but there were no failures.  The seafood and scallion pancake was huge (about the size of a med/large pizza) and stuffed with tons of tender squid and octopus.  Had the sizzling beef bbq...one of the best dishes I've had in a long time.  Tender and flavorful I was annoyed that I had to share.  Also had the rice cake appetizer.  I think this is what I was accidentally given at another Korean restaurant and hated.  Here I loved it.  Spicy, not to thick and full of peppers.  Tried a spicy chicken dish, loved it.  Had a cold soup with buckwheat noodles, loved it.  Short ribs with a sweet broth, loved it.  I even loved the yogurt shot at the end of the meal.   Now I remember how good Korean food can be and am excited to go back again."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in Cleveland!! Amazing side dishes. The spicy rice cake was incredible! The service was wonderful too!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Spicy food is spicy. Fresh vegetables are fresh! You got what you want to order here on Korean food."}
{"text":"I know the owners of this establishment.  Well my parents do.  It's more like a fast food type of Korean place.  Nothing great to me.  However, it's not terrible enough where I would NEVER eat there again, but I'd just prefer better Korean places."}
{"text":"Alright, I've been back here few more times since my first visit, tried different items and there are only few favorites and items that I would avoid.   Things I liked:  1.  Banchans (side items), they give you 10 items and steamed egg (granted the 2nd time I was there, they did not give me steamed eggs).  Of the Banchans, my favorite is the sour seaweed and the bockchoy kimchi.  2.  Service - even when busy, they are able to serve without issues.  On my first visit, they only had that one person working the front, but now they have two people working, they work well and complimenting each other, which is great, because the operations flows flawlessly!!!   3.  I like how they give you yogurt when they bring you the check.   4.  Favorite Food?  I'll have to say their galbi (it's expensive), but it's grilled and delicious. Their Denjang jigae was good as well.    Things I did not like:  Dae gu Tang - this dish has no flavor, when you taste the broth, all you taste is gochujang that's been dissolved in hot water.  They need to season the broth with bit of salt and other seasoning.  I'll never order this again. I ended just eating the fish and leaving behind all the veggies and the broth.   Gae gu Jiri - this is same as above, but clear broth version (non-spicy), the broth was overpowered by the amount of garlic they put in the dish and the broth itself lacked seasoning and flavor.  If seasoned and flavored right, when you sip on the broth, it should be refreshing, but it's not.  Like the tang version, I ended eating only the fish and leaving behind the veggies and the broth as well, like Tang, will not be ordering this dish as well.  On the Middle Ground:  Jaeyook - not bad. While I wouldn't go out of my way to get this, it was decent.   Spicy, so unfortunately the flavor combo really didn't work here... the spice of the dish overpowered the favors, so it was hard to grasp the true taste.   - Kimchi Chigae - Not bad, far better then other Korean joints.   - Spicy Squid - see my original review.   - Dduk Bokki (Spicy Rice Cake) - they have two sizes, 6 pcs or 12 pcs.  At first, I'm like 6 pcs, rice cakes are small so I ordered the 12 pcs, well they use the long rice cakes!!! I couldn't consider this dish a traditional dduk bokki, but it's their take on dduk bokki stir fried.  The sauce here tastes the same as the sauce used in Spicy Squid.   When I return to the area, will skip their jigae offering and try other food items on the menu."}
{"text":"The food and service is very good. It is hard to find a good Korean restaurant in Cleveland so I am glad they are around. The pickled dishes they give out are very good and goes well with the food. The neighborhood is not upscale but that is okay b cause they make it up by their great tasting food. In the end, they even give a Yakilt probiotic with the check. I had a Galbi lunch and it was great."}
{"text":"Really nice homey feel. The service is great, and they bring out a bunch of delicious appetizers.  They give a lot of food, and I definitely encourage people to try it with a group of friends. The food is good, the soups are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Accidently found this place on yelp when in the area. The review look good, so we decided to give it a try. The food is phenomenal and very authentic!! (disclaimer: I am a big fan of Korean food. I would have Korean food whenever and wherever I can. About at least once a week). I was so impressed by the quality of the food. The biggest surprise is that they have souffle egg as one of the appetizer. The other time I had this was in k town New York. This is how authentic the place is to me. This place is like a hidden treasure in the area. Highly recommend ppl around the Cleveland area to give it a try if you  dig Korean cousine."}
{"text":"Most legit Korean place in Cleveland.  Being from CA and having a Korean bf we were on the search for good Korean food and I got a recommendation for this place.  We knew we couldn't expect anything as good as LA, but this place is pretty good although a bit pricier than CA.    Really friendly staff and good food.  They give you a nice selection of banchan and have almost any Korean dish you could want.  We usually get the Galbi or Dolsot Bibimbap or one of the soups (Kimchee Jigae, Gom Tang).  I've tried the soondobu here and although it's not terrible, I'm not a huge fan of it at this restaurant.  I also didn't particularly like their topoki (rice cake) here.  The korean pancake was good but HUMUNGOUS.  So be warned.  Once we did the grill your own meat portion which was also yummy-- a bit expensive and you have to get at least 2 of each meat dish in order to do it.    All in all, our go to place for some good Korean food that reminds us of home.  And don't forget your yakult at the end of the meal!"}
{"text":"This place was good with good authentic Korean cuisine. We were visiting Ohio from Washington (where there are plenty of Korean options available) so this spot was similar to those back home! The prices are a bit staggering (it came out to a total of almost $40 for the two of us, for two dishes), but overall, it was pretty tasty & a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great place. Kimchi jiggae's better than my go to place in Round Rock, Texas granted that I haven't explored much. Ban chan's are plenty and all tasty. I ended up eating way more than my usual portions. We also got the samgyeopsal which of course still can't compete to the one's in Korea but they're not bad."}
{"text":"Relatively tasty and has good service but ends up being about 25$ a meal and doesn't really have the atmosphere for it."}
{"text":"Nice food. The rest room does not look clean and modern. There are many kitchen towels and restroom towels in it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really, really did.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Rather than ordering something more normative to Korean food, I order Ramen.  Big mistake.  I like my noodles hard and chewy and theirs were over-cooked.  The service was pleasant, but I still really think I should have order tofu.  Sad.  So sad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants to go to in Cleveland. Coming from CA, I took for granted all the delicious Korean food options out there. I'm so happy a decent Korean place like Seoul Garden is here!   Unlike a lot of other places here in Cleveland, the banchan (side dish) options are great! And they change it up fairly often, so you can try new dishes. Anddd it's one of the few places that serve steamed egg!!   I come here often, so I've tried a lot of their dishes. Since I usually come in a group, we are able to try multiple dishes. The portions are great for groups, btw, so you can safely feed everyone without ever leaving hungry! My favorite dishes to get here are the different soups (kimchee jigae, gom tang, or the soft tofu-soon dobu). I also love the dolsot bibimbap (rice dish), dukbokki (rice cake), and chap chi (noodle dish). For meats, we usually get the galbi and bulgogi. The best thing to get for a large group is the boodae jigae-junk food stew...which has ramen with an assortment of veggies and meats (including hot dog) mmmh!! You really can't go wrong with the food here!!  The servers are very patient and sweet, as well as attentive. They are also more than happy to explain what is in a dish if you have never had it before. I highly recommend this place, and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent casual restaurant serving Korean cuisine appropriate for lunch or dinner. Service was efficient and the employees did a great job bussing the table and checking in to see if we needed anything. The menu has many photos which makes it easier for us non-Koreans to order. The food was very flavorful and well-executed. I love the banchan! They serve a wide variety of complimentary side dishes with your meal and each of them are very well made and taste delicious. They offer second helpings too which I can't refuse. If you enjoy chewy carbs, try the dukbokki. The smaller size works as a great appetizer. The entree are large and easily shareable. It might not be to everyone's taste but if you like kimchi, the spicy kimchi with pork, rice cakes, and tofu is awesome. I'm already planning when my next visit will be. Many other items are calling my name such as the pajeon and some of the soups/stews. Definitely worth the 20 minute drive!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Parma for over 10 years and my house is within walking distance to Seoul Garden. We finally went on Sunday night for dinner after reading all of the Yelp reviews. I can't believe what I have been missing all these years! My husband and daughter ordered the hot pot which was Amazing. I ordered the Bulgogi which was just as Amazing! I am so ready to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Hannah and Sarah were delightful.  Service was very attentive.  The pen chen (sp?) was plentiful and delicious.  The menu had so many great choices, both Korean and Japanese, that I was a bit overwhelmed.  I found out that they have a signature gochujang (my favorite - kind of like korean ketchup mixed with a little hot sauce if you've never tried it), so I had to sample it.  I ended up having 2 orders of bibim bop.  It was great.  I was so impressed that I ordered 2 more items to go which I hope to enjoy today.  The bill for all that was a little over $40 bucks.  Quality, quantity, and value.  If there was a yelp award they would be gold medalists."}
{"text":"I ordered galbi tang and it was very tasted. It is a little bit spicy but in a good way. They have 10 small dishes and they are all good. highly recommend this place! It's the best Korean restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not Korean, I'm Polish. And Polish people know nothing about Korean food. But we do know cabbage and so we take kindly to kimchi.   We were looking for something new to eat and after reading the reviews on Yelp, we headed over to Seoul Restaurant/Seoul Garden/Asian Cuisine (they have an identity crisis). My fiance lived in SoCal but it has been a while since he's had Korean food and me, well I was a Korean food virgin. So we ordered a shared starter and our entrees.   The shumai emerged from the kitchen and was delicious. And then the banchan came. And came. And came. I was totally unprepared for all these little dishes of wonder. I wish they had come with a guide map (I was sneakily Wikipedia-ing banchan dishes on my iPhone under the table). Napa kimchi, some mixed vegetable kimchi, daikon kimchi, sweet glazed potatoes, lotus root, bean sprouts, radish noodles, gyeran jjim, dried anchovy (surprisingly delicous!); I can't remember all of them.   I had the hot stone seafood bibimbap for my entree. It was slightly intimidating at first, \"Do I mix it all together? Do I pour the sauce in or dip?\" I just mixed and poured and enjoyed it as a big mess and it was delicious! The seafood (shrimp, clams, squid, octopus and maybe some other things I couldn't recognize) were delicious - really fresh, not chewy at all. It was really comforting type food. I highly recommend it!  The bbq that my fiance got was delicious, too. Their rice is highly addicting.  Also, love the little yogurt shot at the end. Tasted like a creamsicle, Beats the hell out of a fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Seoul Garden is probably the best Korean restaurant in northeastern Ohio. Everything I have tried tastes just like my mom and aunts home cooking. If you are looking for an authentic korean food experience, this is the place. It may seem a little more on the expensive side, however your meal will come with complimentary banchan dishes with free refills"}
{"text":"Seoul Garden was an interesting experience. The outside of the building is very deceiving in that it looks abandoned, but don't let that deter you from stopping in. When we arrived we were quickly greeted by a staff member who took us to our seat. It took a little while for our waiter to come to the table but we attributed the wait to the large volume of people in the restaurant. After much contemplation I decided to try the seafood soup. I wasn't impressed. The soup was bland and wasn't what I was expecting. The side dishes however we're delightful.   I was visit Seoul Garden again and try another menu item."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, and looking for an authentic Korean restaurant or even any authentic restaurant, this is definitely the place to go to. Though the place is not as 'fine' as you might imagine, the food is delicious and the service was very good. Quite a few options for meat and seafood lovers but not so much for vegetarians. Try the hotbowl with anything, it's really delicious! There're are four different sides you'd get with every order. I loved the white jelly thing with lightly roasted and salted sesame seeds!! After you enjoy your delicious meal, sipping on that tiny bottle of the strawberry yogurt drink will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"SEOUL GARDEN! This place did not disappoint. It had been on my list FOREVER and I finally made the trip with a friend. My first thought: This place smells absolutely incredible. The smell consumes you of the incredible Korean food being cooked around you on hot plates. From the outside, it doesn't necessarily look like much, but the minute you sit down and see the gigantic menu, you'll be a believer.  Since I love Korean food, we decided to try several things. I'm regretting not taking more photos of the menu (and I can't seem to find any online) so forgive me if I'm about to butcher the names of something. My favorite was the #33, the Ssap Gyup Sal (pork belly which you cook at your table than wrap with lettuce, sauces, and rice) and the #39 Jap Chae with thin crystal noodles, veggies and beef. Each had such a distinct flavor that we didn't want to stop eatting.  I'm newer to the Korean food scene, but I doubt anything from this menu could be bad. I also need to disagree with some other reviewers - I found the prices very fair for the huge amount of food you get! They also had tea waiting on the table, which was a nice touch. We literally took home two boxes of leftovers that smelled delicious the entire way home. I will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once. My wife loved it and is actually going back for take out. I am not a big fan. They give you a lot of food and a bunch of little side dishes. For me it is just okay. My biggest problem is the run down condition of the interior. It makes me think that if they don't care about the torn table tops and dingy floors and walls, are they clean in the kitchen? I can only give it three stars because for me the interior is not at all inviting."}
{"text":"Want some amazing Korean cuisine?! COME HERE! Staff is friendly, fast and the food is fresh. Not only that....but bring a friend or two, their entree portions are massive. The small side dishes are well made and definitely fun to try. My friends and I love this place, a bti pricy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say that I've lived in Cleveland for so many years yet only in the past year have I found out about this place. Seoul Garden blows every other Korean restaurant in Cleveland (and possibly Ohio) out of the water. I have not tried the Japanese dishes yet, but the Korean dishes are among some of the best I have tasted. They make donkkaseu very differently from Japanese tonkatsu, and I assume that their style of using thinly sliced pork cutlets with their own barbecue sauce is the authentic Korean method. Their pajeon is very clearly a homemade recipe, and is far better than the scallion pancakes you can get at many other establishments. As for their banchan, you are always served gyeran jjim along with a wide assortment of delicious banchan. Their gyeran jjim is very good, and the fact that you get it with every order just makes the price tag on the dishes all the more worth it. You also get Yakult as dessert with every meal. When I go with my parents, there's 3 of us and we order 2 entrees, yet we always have enough leftovers for another meal. Given the exceptional quality of the food AND the quantity that you are given, Seoul Garden is easily one of the best Korean restaurants I have ever been to, and also one of the best Asian restaurants you can eat at in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food! This place is owned by a family and the food is the real deal! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I came back here on a Saturday with five other friends to eat that fabulous Korean BBQ we had last month.  The BBQ was still fantastic.  My Korean friend said that the banchan were exactly what her mom would serve at her own dinner table.  And.. they still had the steamed egg, the yakult yogurt shots, and the place was full of Asian people.  The soups... supposedly about as good as Ha Ahn.  Not perfect but either way this place still has the best Korean food in the Cleve.  But... we waited an hour and a half for our food to come out.  Actually, two people's food came out in an hour, and the rest of the food took an hour and a half.  Seriously?  Were they making the soup base from scratch or something?  I'd still come back here, because the BBQ is that good, but maybe on a weekday?"}
{"text":"Very good. It's always great to have a place I can go to that reminds me of home. While I'm not particularly a fan of the location, it's far from a deterrent. Unless you're familiar with Korean food, I recommend asking for recommendations or picking based on the kinds of protein you like. The menu is a bit hard to navigate and is kinda clunky, but most have images that are helpful. I'm nostalgic about home cooking, so take that into consideration.  Tip 1: Anything you order will come out as if it skipped the pass and is served directly from fire to table. Be careful, don't burn yourself.   Tip 2: If you are in a group of more than 4 people and plan on going during peak hours, call ahead. It's 100% on you if you don't call ahead and end up standing outside for 30-45 minutes.  Tip 3: Parking can be tight, I suggest going for lunch of just before dinner service.  Tip 4: If you are prone to butchering languages you are not familiar with, order using the # next to the corresponding dish.   Remember, Yelp reviews are all personal opinion. You might never know if you like something until you try it. Often times you see \"Yelpers\" on here and their review is filled with shallow attempts at comedy, rather than anything that might be helpful to others. Take Akhilesh's review, complaining about spice level (spice tolerance being something that varies person to person) and about the name of a menu item being overly grandiose and upcharged due to that. -_- LUL. Seriously though, don't let your views be swayed so easily by the ramblings of random people you don't know (including me). Use these reviews as a guideline to set your expectations, then re-evaluate them after you've tried the establishment."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. While the wait for everything is forever. Only two waiters and doing things with no order."}
{"text":"Came here twice for dinner and was wow-ed both times. The food was *delicious*, the service was prompt and courteous, and the ambiance was relaxed. This is definitely becoming a regular destination!"}
{"text":"From the outside the Seoul Garden doesn't show much promise but once you get past that you are in for an authentic Korean meal!   I have eaten here on 2 different occasions and was impressed both times. The banchan (side dishes) were different on both occasions and unlike being in Korea I could actually find out what I was eating :)   I recommend trying the Korean Pancake which is actually more like a pizza. My server on both occasions was able to recommend food and explain what it was. Try something new and stop by the Seoul Garden!"}
{"text":"The small dishes here are fantastic! My favorite thing about the restaurant is that they are generous with the portions of their small dishes and they have a great variety! I recommend the sweet, pickled bok choy, the fish cakes, steaming egg dish, and their steaming hot potatoes! For food, my three friends and I shared a seafood pancake, seafood bibimbap and a pork belly KBBQ for 2 people.   Their seafood pancake is delicious! It is big and filled with seafood- octopus, shrimp and scallions. The edges are nice and crispy the sauce is savory! The seafood bibimbap was ok- tasty but nothing super special. The veggies cooked nicely in the bowl and the rice was sticky. The KBBQ was definitely the focus of the meal. They brought out a portable stove and we cooked it right at the table. They provided two sauces, garlic and jalapenos to grill. We also added some kimchi to the grill and ate all of it in a fresh lettuce leaf. The server provided more lettuce and small dishes upon request!   The service was good - we got attention when needed, but they were also busy attending to other guests. Would definitely recommend for a cold day!"}
{"text":"What! I love this place! I won't say too much since everyone already has, but it's great. I mean, that egg banchan though.... Oh my god. And that comes with the meal, crazy!!! I would pay just for that.  The dish sizes are definitely for family style eating. So be prepared to be full. The cost is a little higher than Korea House downtown, but I think it is better tasting and bigger. They do not have kimbap :( So if they ever have that, they will be definitely be the best around. Until then! I must get my kimbap elsewhere sadly."}
{"text":"Really nice people and a nice big Korean menu. The banchan is plentiful and interesting. The kimchi was especially good. We got a variety of dishes, which left us stuffed and with plenty of leftovers. Seems like a quaint and simple family run operation, and the food reflects that -- it's Asian \"soul\" food (insert groan)."}
{"text":"There's not a lot to say that hasn't already been said about this place. I would simply confirm with everyone else's said the food here is amazing! The servers were helpful and friendly and obviously help many people not familiar with Korean cuisine. It's also a lot of fun to watch other people eat as the food is so exotic and interesting. Highly recommended and I hope to become a regular diner here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very expensive and also myself as a Korean, I am offended that they call it \"SEOUL GARDEN\"!!! The only good thing about the restaurant is that the amount is huge, but who wants to have a huge amount of junk?"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! It under new ownership and this guy has been renovating the place a bit to give it a little spunk.  The service was fast and since the place is a bit small, sometimes you have to wait for seating if it's packed.  (It is seriously worth the wait!). I love everything on their menu!  I've honestly tried almost everything on their menu and I never left disappointed!  This place has true authentic Korean food! The flavors are always there!  The give you such a generous portion of Korean appetizer dishes as well!!! My favorite is the boiled egg! Everyone there is so friendly and prompt so they catered to my every need.  The portions of the dish you order is definitely big so you should expect to have some food left over to take home unless you have a big appetite or company with you... I usually come with someone and usually we would order two dishes so we both have a nice snack or meal later on.  Definitely love coming here and would recommend this place to anyone looking for some authentic Korean cuisine!"}
{"text":"There are very few Asian restaurants that I can drag my friends to which are outside of Cleveland's AsiaTown.   When I mention Seoul Garden though, there are always several takers.  The dishes are large, tasty, and filling.  I really like Korean barbecue and enjoyed both their galbi and bulgogi.    Huge selection of banchan dishes.  I went with one friend to Seoul Garden recently and was served 9 different sides.  The waitstaff is very friendly and polite.  We couldn't decide what to order, so the waiter recommended a spicy fried chicken dish which was very good.    Wish this restaurant was a little bit closer.  I would be there much more often."}
{"text":"Korean food may not be everyone's favorite, but it is one of mine. About an hour before closing time, there were about 5 tables occupied, and with a quick look around, I was stoked for a really good experience.   The menu is in both Korean and English, with English explanations. I didn't have time for a dish to cook at my table, but they looked and smelled great at the other tables. I opted for a 1/2 rice cake appetizer and a Korean vegetable pancake entree. Tea came First, then the banchan (pickled and spicy vegetables, kimchi and tofu items) came and was overwhelming, in a good way.   In all, the food was enough for at least two adults, if not three. I pretended and had a partner there and ate for them, too. Everything reminded me of home cooking I had in a small, rural home in Korea.   I'll definitely return when I have a chance. It's not far from the Cleveland airport, so it would be good for a late evening arrival.   The Yogurt drink with the check was a fantastic end to the meal."}
{"text":"First time visit.  We were a party of 7 and had to wait about 40 mins (arrived at 6:30).  When we got seated it took a very long time for anyone to wait on us.  The waiting was getting a little annoying, but that was the only bad thing about our time here.  The food was FANTASTIC!  We ordered some steamed and fried dumpling and edamame.  All of the apps were great.  They also give you about 6 or 7 different pickled plates (kim che, tofu, radish, seaweed, zuccini, potato, bean sprout).   And they also give you an egg dish.  All were very good.  As for the meals we had the Bibimbap, spicy chicken, and a beef dish.  Everything was delicious.   The service did get better.  They were super busy when we got there and the place is very small  Aside from the service at the beginning, this place was a 5... definitely plan on coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This shop sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The waitress got bad face( cold and not friendly) and slowest service!!!! Most importantly, I did not give any tips, and they charged me for 5 bocks!!! I went there tonight!!!!! And now I checked my bank account, and then I found out!! I will call them and correct it ASAP!!!!! Suck place. Will Never Go Again!!!!!!!!!!!!  Btw, the food is not good at all either!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Being from Los Angeles I didn't have high expectations. However, the freshness, variety of Banchon and portions were very satisfying. The waiter was extremely helpful and always came by to ask us if we need somethings. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Great authentic food by Koreans that will (if you ask) coach you through the whole process of ordering and eating. Place looks like a dive but is home to some delicious food, so give it a try.  I had Kimchi soup and mistakenly thought the free, included appetizers we're the soup (there are a bunch of things to same before your meal is brought out). Server was great and explained the process. Food was great. Go eat it!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean food.  Very good. Flavorful... Huge ginormous portions... If you want more banchan, they are more than happy to refill.   We were a group of 10 and got numerous dishes.   Kalbi: One thing I must say is that the Kalbi was not so great. The Kalbi was super tough and just not pleasurable to eat. It was almost like someone else mentioned on yelp thy are cutting with the grain of beef causing very sinewy tough meat... Prepuce is pretty steep for what you get. Portion is perfect for one.  Bulgogi: The bulgogi was much much better in that the meat was well marinated and was tender. Perfect portion for one or two depending on consumption.   Yookgaejang(spicy beef soup): broth was hearty and savory. This bowl was perfectly portioned for one person.  Pork/kimchi and tofu dish: the dish itself was good but the pork was wayyyyy too salty. The kimchi in this dish was perfectly ripened and had a good tangy taste. Portion is huge. Good for two.  Chapchae (glass noodles): meh. It was ok. But nothing phenomenal...  Dwenjangchigae  : robust flavor and spicy level can be adjusted by request.  Tang-soo-yook : sauce was a bit thicker than normal and the pieces of fried poultry was uneven. Some where every crispy while some were soggy. Huge portion. good for two. Which is great if one person likes crispy and the other likes soggy :)  Overall food is good but the interior, such as the extremely wobbly chairs and tables need to be updated badly."}
{"text":"Seoul Garden is always my No. 1 Korean Restaurant in Cleveland. Price is affordable and the food is pretty authentic. Usually I went with bunch of friends and order family style so we can share different kind of food. This is my first time went there in week day lunch hours. Lunch menu includes different lunch box and soup .It's very cost efficient. Price ranges from $7 to $10. It will definitely feed you well with different unlimited banchan (side dishes). I ordered beef short rib soup and when all the food comes, I feel the quantity if for two people. I am very pleased and impressed about the quality and quantity of the lunch special.   I love to have a hot, delicious and spicy Korean soup when Cleveland is snowing!"}
{"text":"I had hoped that the last few visits were a fluke, however, I must sadly report that they were not. The service has just gotten atrocious since Hannah is no longer there. The staff seems surprised that people are actually coming to patronize their business and that those diners have expectations, e.g that the diners would like refills on their drinks, or that their waiter or waitress will stop in periodically to check in on them. Sadly, my last visit will be the last for awhile. Food was great as always, but the service was too disappointing to stomach."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in Cleveland. I've tried several of their dishes but always go back to the Kim chi jigae - it's the best I've had. Flavorful, filling and the perfect mix of ingredients. The small plates of various Korean food dishes they bring out too is great - I especially love the boiled egg. Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe I'm writing about the SAME place that everyone is raving about here! I feel left out! On 1/19/16 my best friend and I decided that we wanted to try a Korean restaurant and this was the first listing that came up on Yelp.  Before I continue to review this place, I want to say that this was the SECOND time we tried this place and were disappointed all over again.    The FIRST time we tried this place it was in the summer time last year.  A girl from work mentioned good things about this place and the three of us girls wanted to try it.  We ordered the dumplings (decent) but we also ordered one of the $35 platters that serve 2-3 people.  Well, my best friend and I tried the platter and looked at each other right away with surprise.  There were sliced hot dogs and SPAM in our bowls.  How can ANY Asian restaurant that claims to serve Asian food give us dishes with SPAM and sliced hot dogs?!?  Disappointing BUT a second chance was deserved.   Now on to our SECOND trip to Seoul Garden on 1/19/16.  My best friend and I had HIGH hopes for this place and wanted to try it just the two of us.  It was just before lunchtime and it was not busy when we arrived as there was one other table being served.  I had ordered the spicy Bimbim Bop w/beef and my friend ordered a spicy dish of Yook Gae Jang.  Right away we were disappointed again because the Barley tea they serve you while order was NOT Barley tea at all!  It was slightly flavored HOT water. Then the small side dishes arrived right after ordering.  None of them were good.  Our main dishes were NOT any better.  My dish was room temperature and there was enough beef in the bowl to fill a tea spoon. The sauce wasn't even spicy it was SWEET! VERY disappointing.  My friend's soup wasn't much better.  The broth had NO flavor!  Her soup should have been a SPICY beef flavored broth but it wasn't.  It was water with SOME spice and NO SALT was added.  Overall, TWO stars because the food was a MAJOR letdown in an otherwise nice, small place to sit down with friends."}
{"text":"Good Korean food in the Valley continues to be difficult to find."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem!  The short ribs are fantastic!  Also had the sweet and sour chicken and steak. All were tasty. They start your meal with ten appetizers and will refill the ones you ask to be refilled. Our server spent so much time with us explaining dishes, which was greatly appreciated!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant anywhere in the US. I have been several times and tried a few things on the menu and have never left disappointed. My favorite dish here is the lamb casserole, it's amazing. Be warned, the menu recommends 2-3 people for this dish, however, it can easily fees 5."}
{"text":"Umm. Wow. I knew to trust this place because of these reviews here on yelp, but when me and my husband arrived, we were certainly hesitant. It's literally a hole in the wall. Underwhelming from the outside, we almost turned around. We chose adventure and went inside.   The food that was coming out of that kitchen looked phenomenal; we felt better about choosing this place. The service was really great, our server gave us great recommendations and explained everything to us. My husband got some sort of barbecue short rib which was a lightly sweet Asian barbecue sauce over braised beef. I found it a nice palate cleanser for my meal which was something I couldn't pronounce, but basically a seafood stir fry served in a cast iron bowl. It came with a spicy chili? sauce on the side and I accidentally made mine a bit too spicy by putting too much on. Regardless, it was still amazing. Give Seoul a shot, it's really a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Staff was helpful in understanding the menu. Be advised that most entrees come with a huge serving of ~12 side dishes. We ordered soup and appetizer and went home with enough food for days."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. We need to tell friends about this place."}
{"text":"After a conference, I was craving Korean food and heading to the airport.  The server  advised I get the bibimbap as this would come out the fastest.   Happy to get lots of banchan, steamed egg, and a yogurt shot.  And I made it on time for my flight!"}
{"text":"Love this Korean spot!! Definitely a great spot to enjoy Korean cuisine. They have amazing banchan (small sides which come gratis to every table).  We went tonight and enjoyed the bulgogi, dumpling soup, chicken 'wings', bibimbap and chicken teriyaki.  Bulgogi was great- came cooked with stir fried veggies and had a nice light flavor. Definitely enjoyed and was good for the non-spicy food eaters.  My friend liked the dumpling soup- actually she said it was her favorite thing of the evening. I'm a huge fan of bibimbap and this is usually my go to- I enjoy it the most in the hot stone dish and this one did no disappoint. Love the earthiness of the dish and enjoyed the hot sauce and adding the banchan kimchi to the top. The chicken teriyaki was also delicious. Came with broccoli and big sliced carrots- both were crispy and a nice contrast to the sweet sauce. The sauce was sweet but not super thick and cloying like Chinese teriyaki can be.  The chicken 'wings' were actually boneless and sort of reminded me of Bonchon chicken but with way more peppers. I loved them and so did the others but even the non- spice eaters couldn't resist. One of them commented it was a vamped up version of general tso's.  Added some references from those who never had Korean before. I have had it in DC and NYC and am so delighted to have such a good spot to enjoy it in CLE!!  Go and try something to start and then observe others with hotpots and yummy seafood pancakes etc. with winter coming- perfect place to get your soup on!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I've been driving by this place for years and I never thought to stop in.  I guess I wasn't sure if it was open.  It always looked closed and abandoned from the outside.  But no!  This place is alive and well on the inside.  Based on all the great Yelp! reviews, I had to try Seoul Restaurant.  I love Asian food and we were not disappointed.  Don't let the condition of the exterior of the building fool you like it did me.    When we arrived, we were served tea and we also ordered water.  For dinner, I ordered the Yaki Soba with shrimp and my wife ordered the same with chicken.  For the kids, we ordered chicken fried rice.  A few minutes later, food began arriving at our table, starting with 10 free appetizers that they provide.  I don't remember what all of them were, but I do remember scrambled egg, tofu, kimchi, seaweed, three types of radish, some clear gelatin strips, and a few others.  The appetizers were interesting, some of them were spicy, some weren't.  They were all served cold.  We also ordered edamame for my daughter.  The Yaki Soba was served sizzling hot on a hot pan, just like fajitas at your traditional Mexican restaurants.  Boy, were they hot!  Once they cooled down, I tasted my first bite.  Wow, delicious!  Loved the noodles.  There were tons of Asian greens mixed with the noodles and I loved the taste and texture of the dish.  I wanted more noodles and so did my wife.  As i write this review, the lingering after taste of the sauce on the noodles is just yummy and I want more!  The waitress was very friendly and she brought us a desert drink that tasted like yogurt.  I still can't believe I haven't eaten here before as it is about one mile from my house! I'll be back, with friends!"}
{"text":"I probably would say Seoul Garden is the best Korean food in CLE.  Now, you're not going to find the Korean food that you find in LA or Seoul, here in CLE. This is not any of those cities, so you really have to take that into account.  After saying that, the Korean food here is probably the best in CLE.  Many of the normal dishes- the galbi, bulgogi, japchae, etcera are good at Seoul Garden- is it the best I've had? No, but it sure is the best in CLE! The stews and soups are all good too.  I was a little saddened over the increase in prices that have had happened over the past years- but hey, it's a family business, the food is good, and service is great as well- you really can't complain.  Also, they have a pretty good selection of banchan as well, so that's nice.   If you crave Korean food, definitely take the drive out to Parma to go here!"}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have been to Seoul Garden, with the previous trip happening in Thanksgiving over 1 year ago. Needless to say, any misgivings I had during the first trip have been completely erased with my most recent visit.  It is a small hole in the wall restaurant. The interior is similar to all other Chinese take-out places.  Service: the waitress was extremely polite and hardworking. Every time we said thank you, she would always always say \"you're welcome\" back to us, so like probably heard her say this like 20 times during our entire visit, lol. Always attentive, and would check up on us to make sure we had enough tea, enough banchan.  Ordered: kalbi and some spicy fried chicken thingy. Kalbi was nicely grilled, flavorful, well marinated. Spicy fried chicken thingy was extremely tasty, reminded me of koreanized fried orange chicken at the mall, except done 10x better. Sadly, I cannot comment too much on the food we actually ordered as I like veggies more, and was busy stuffing myself at the banchan. We had plenty leftover, and it was just as tasty.  Now on to my favorite part. The banchan. I pretty much inhaled all the dishes, except one of the weird bokchoy thingy that I took one bite of, and neglected. My bf really liked the steamed egg thing, and the radish. I loved the cucumbers, and the agar, and seaweed that tasted like wakame!!! We both loved the potatoes and probably got like 4 servings of that. Loved the banchan.  The only sad thing is that right after we left, we realized that we forgot to get the yogurt shot that they typically serve at the end of the meal. Oh well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about this place on yelp, so I decided to drive out of my way to try it out, and I was fairly disappointed afterwards.  The restaurant is pretty nice and clean. It seemed pretty popular too. I ordered a squid dish, and the sauce was very watered down. It was not even red, it was orange. The squid tasted very watery too, not the chewy type that I was expecting. One thing I liked about this restaurant was that they gave us this asian yogurt instead of fortune cookie after we pay our bill. But overall, my first time experience there was not ideal but I might give it another chance to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I recently checked this place out after reading Yelp reviews and receiving a business card from the owners themselves (i.e., the owners of Kim's Oriental Food on Superior Ave). I decided to take my parents, who were in town visiting. We were not impressed.  (1) Our waiter was terrible. We had some young man who lacked basic communication skills. I am not referring to a language barrier, but more of an attitude/image issue. He was behaving as if he was \"too cool\" to be a waiter. My parents kept trying to ask him specific questions in Korean about seasoning (specifically, they did not want too much sugar or any MSG), and his responses were like, \"huh..........eh............dunno.\" He kept sighing and made zero eye contact with any of us. My god, if you feel uncomfortable with us talking to you in Korean, then just simply respond in English or lie that you don't understand Korean. But DO say something when adults, especially paying customers, are speaking to you. It's sad when your Korean-American identity psych issues have gotten you to this point of lousiness. Grow up, bozo.  (2) The banchan and main dishes were overall either too sweet or too salty. The food was not necessarily lacking in taste; it's just that the sugar and salt was overpowering. My mother, for instance, ordered an unadon. The eel was absolutely DRENCHED in the sweet sauce. In fact, there was more sauce than the underlying rice. How is that even possible? Basically, her unadon was a SUGAR SOUP that contained a bit of rice and a bit of fish. That's just not correct, sorry. My mom had to scrape the sauce off and then further pad the fish down with napkins before eating it. Also, she ordered a separate side bowl of rice because her \"sugar soup rice\" was inedible.  My father ordered the Galbi, and that too was too sweet. He wondered why they would ruin tasty marinade with so much sugar. We found half of the banchan not worth eating. For example, they gave us an egg-cchim (steamed egg) in a stone bowl, which tasted like soft chunks of salt.  Authenticity for me is not some fluid notion. I find that Korean food is either authentic, or it isn't. That said, this restaurant (like many others out there) falls squarely into the authentic Korean food class, for sure. However, authentic does not automatically mean delicious or nutritionally sound. Obviously, one expects to encounter more sugar/salt/fat when they go dining out, but I do not expect to encounter the upper limits of this acquiescence in a Korean restaurant, of all places! If you're worried about Type 2 diabetes (a very reasonable thing to be worried about in this day and age), I wouldn't recommend eating here often."}
{"text":"After sampling at the other Korean restaurants in Cleveland, I can say (along with my guests) that Seoul Garden is hands down our favorite.   They don't hold back on the banchon nor their portions.  Everything I have tried has been very authentic tasting, unlike some other places where they might cut a few corners.    I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, however try and take someone with you that is somewhat familiar as their long menus can be very intimidating."}
{"text":"Typical Korean restaurant. I ordered mandu (korean dumpling) and soondobu (spicy tofu stew). Dumpling was good. Soondobu was alright, had better at other places. They brought plenty of side dishes to eat which was great. By the end, I was definitely full. For Cleveland with barely any Korean restaurants, this place in Parma is a decent and probably most authentic place for korean food fix."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were very happy with our food. Got there around 2 pm on a Tuesday and it was quite busy. We were quickly presented with hot tea and 10 great sides including steamed egg with fish sauce. All were terrific. We ordered the fried dumpling app. They were very light and tasty with a great dipping sauce. You can get a half or full order on some of the appetizers including those. My husband and I both ordered the stone bowl bibimbap. It was terrific too. Not sure why other reviewer said they had no forks. We requested and immediately received forks. The only criticism, and it's not a big one and easily corrected, is that we sat by a large window with a 5\" deep sill. It really needed a cleaning. Having said that, everything we tried was very flavorful and we will definitely return. We had a wonderful first visit."}
{"text":"I finally got to go to Seoul Restaurant with some friends last week, and absolutely loved it. The grilled mackerel (my favorite dish to order at any Korean restaurant) is superb, as was all the banchan. The cucumber kimchi was especially delicious.  All the delicious food reminded me of a typical Korean meal at my mom's, only without all the judgment, criticism, and tears!"}
{"text":"Ban Chan generosity! Came for a lunch box and got variety of 9 mini ban chan and a pot of egg souffle other yelpers seem to love. When my kalbi arrived, OMG. It was a moment. I've been super blue these past few weeks over different target misses that had me wondering where AM I? But here, my dove, is a landmark albeit 15 miles away from me, that has spot on Kalbi. I forget everything else, the other people, the space, the lunch box sides that were OK..just get in here. The Kalbi is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has such a great review. I luv korean food, and so I was fairly excited to try this place. However I was kinda disappointing at almost everything.  I ordered a traditional spicy tofu soup with seafood. I was very surprised to find out that the soup was fairly mild, no flavor at all, and the egg is completely raw. I understand the egg should b like a sunny side up, but mine was like 95% raw, most of the egg white were still liquid. IMO, this soup dish is the least likely to mess up.  I ordered a seafood pancake as well, that was just an ok dish. but 2b honest, I haven't found a Korean restaurant cooked that perfectly here in Cleveland, so I guess I can't complain too much And I also ordered a pork BBQ, I don't remember what exactly the cut was, but it was the most expensive one under the BBQ category. The meat weren't marinated, and it came with two dipping sauce, one was too salty and had a very strong sesame flavor, the other was too sweet IMO. The server put the meat on the pan and just left without a word. My friends and I were confused, we didnt know if he was gonna come back and help us cook until it's ready or not. And it turned out to be we need to cook all by ourselves, which was completely ok, but I really wish he would have told us so. I mean, he was the one who started to cook, we weren't really sure what's gonna happen next"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times and love the place . We are vegetarians and weren't sure if we will get veggie food in this place . I saw good reviews in yelp and thought of checking it out . So worth it . The lady at the desk was so helpful . She got us only the vegetarian banchan and helped us with the menu . The diek bok gi is both my husband and my fav .. very tasty . I loved the veggie pancake . This time I tried the udon noodles too and they were good . We wanted a glass of the yogurt and the lady was kind enough to give us 3 bottles of the yogurt beforehand . We will certainly come and have food here again ."}
{"text":"The decor reminds me of a scene taken from a cheesy Korean drama. Plenty of plastic plant fixtures, pinks flowers and bamboo panels. To bad that stuff doesn't bother me. I'm not judging this place based on the fact that I'm from Southern California! I'm giving this place 5 stars because we're in Cleveland, and compared to all the other Korean restaurants, they all suck and this place doesn't!  The food is pretty good. Every time I've gone there--lunch or dinner, banchan overload. Soondubu chigea, kaibi bbq, chapjae are the staples for us. The finishing touch with your check, a shot of yogurt drink!   Lunch specials are more affordable and it puts me in a food coma."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was decent. I will definitely go back when I go to visit my friend who lives over in that neighborhood. This review was probably no help at all. Come to think of it, most of my reviews are no help at all. I just use Yelp as a way to express how odd it is to be a human being. It is weird to be alive. I guess my favorite thing about Korean food is that banchan reflects the weirdness of life. I guess we are all like little pickled dishes and you don't know what you are getting."}
{"text":"A nice homey, family-run place.  If you can find it, it's worth the trip.  Had the seafood pajan and yukejang (spicy beef stew).  Tasted the kalbi as well.  Yukejang was great; reminded me of some of the great authentic restaurants in NYC.  The pajan was a little thick and therefore, too doughy, but had a lot of seafood packed in.  They offer a nice variety of panchan (little appetizer dishes).  Overall, the best korean place in Cleveland (compared to Miega and Ha Ahn).  The name of this place is slightly confusing.  Not sure if it's Seoul Restaurant or Seoul Garden...even more confusing that both exist on yelp...so just go by the address."}
{"text":"This place is a HIDDEN GEM!!!! I can't say enough nice things about it. The food is amazing, the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable!!! You have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesomeness authentic Korean grills. Comes here many many times. Never disappointed on any of the dishes that I've order"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Dingy place. Nice service. A bit pricey. Pretty solid authentic Korean food.  5 - deik bok gi - rice cakes as a snake. We got 6-piece. Great deal 29 - Kalbi - ribs. Pretty good 30 - bulgogi- steak, very good 52 - Kahn poong go - fried chicken. Great"}
{"text":"On the national scale this only gets ~ 2-3.5.  This gets a 4 for where it is -- this is by far and away the best Korean restaurant in the Cleveland area that I know of.  It's by a Pizza Hut but the inside decor is cute. The service is very friendly. They didn't even re-educate some dolt who came in asking for fried wontons and left immediately. (If you reject a place I like, you reject me too sir... not.. bitter...)  They give a nice amount of good banchan (complementary side dish/appetizers). Try the nakiji bokkeum (stir fried.. spicy octupus? with veg'ls -- it satisfies my mom) & tangsooyuk (korean style chinese fried pork strips in sweet/sour sauce). Spicy ddukbokki (rice cake) dish and umm savory seafood pancake dish. also pretty okay.   I like the hot pot bibimbap (mixed meat egg and veg'ls on rice), soondooboo (soft tofu and spicy seafood stew) and i love kalbi (sweet marinated short rib) anywhere. Here isn't particularly great, but they don't mess it up so I love it. (Kalbi single handedly un-vegetarianized me) For some reason my dad always gets the mandu guk (dumpling soup)... I think he just likes that dish though.   They also serve Japanese food in case you're craving that.   Servings are generous so you can just take whatever you don't eat home.   If it adds to credibility I am a KOREAN-AMERICAN who has lived in Ohio since 9 mos. of age, and from age ~4-18 ate Korean food nearly every day (thanks mom)"}
{"text":"Hands down best Korean food in Cleveland. Reasonable prices for the huge portions. Make sure to come with friends so you can try a little of everything! Weekends and evenings are pretty busy so come early or take out if you don't want to wait at least 20 min since the place is pretty small.   Some recommendations - deik bok gi (spicy rice cakes, amazing) japchae (jelly noodles in a sweet sauce with beef) gopdol bibim bop (crispy rice, so good) panjean (veggie pancake, size of your head) spicy kalbi tang (spicy short rib soup)  Make sure you come hungry, you'll want to try everything!"}
{"text":"From location and the look of this place on the outside - and inside - I was a bit skeptical about my dinner. However everything turned out great. The place was really busy - on a Wednesday night there were a lot of large groups and every table was full but for a couple. The one server who was working the entire restaurant definitely was hustling. He was friendly and apologetic over the wait. He would disappear at times so I'm guessing he had a few kitchen tasks to do as well  - perhaps preparing the Banchan. Speaking of the Banchan, this was a total surprise for me. And a wonderful one at that. I had never had Korean food before, but every dish in the Banchan series that came out to the table (9 or 10 in all) I loved. I have no idea what they all were, but they were definitely delicious. As a main dish I got the Bul Gogi which was very good. The beef slices were very thinly sliced and cooked perfectly. The accompanying fresh veggies were great and unlike most American dishes of the same kind it was not swimming in any sauce. The other two appetizers we ordered were equally good and I wish I could remember their names. The menu is huge and you could go back time and time again and order something different. Get past the appearance and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Their galbi is VERY good. I almost wanna order 2 orders even though one order is pretty filling because of how good it is. Their spicy rice cake noodles are good too. They give many neat starters for everyone like steamed egg, black beans, kimchi, yogurt drinks, etc. Some Korean people have said that this tastes just like back in South Korea!"}
{"text":"Undistinguished exterior and you're not paying for a high-end interior either -- good!  The basic side dishes were expansive and among the best I've had anywhere (including in Korea).  The dolt sot bibimbop [I think their menu had a nother name for it] was excellent and tasty.  They do have beer -- but a very, very limited variety.  They also had some  sweetish-looking Korean wine of some sort. In sum:   Food quality: 5   Service:  5+   Variety of menu items:  5   Variety of non-alcoholic beverages:  5   Variety of alcoholic beverages:  2  [If u have a license, why not USE it?]   Value:  4.5 or 5   Ambiance:  3 Would we go back?  ABSOLUTELY!  Excellent food at a very fair price!"}
{"text":"My experiences at Seoul Garden have been fantastic- especially my latest trip reminded me that I have to visit it much more often. The banchan tasted fresh and was a great way to start the meal- the cucumber kimchi is delicious/crisp and perfect for the summer. The steamed egg was my favorite part! (I could eat 2 bowls of rice just with that). Our main entrees were seafood soft tofu soup and chicken ggang-poongi; we asked for extra spicy and it was perfect to taste. Nothing was overly salty and for the most part very flavorful. I'd say that this is the best place to get Korean food in the Cleveland area- it's a must-try! P.S. Service is usually great here, too!"}
{"text":"I will admit that I am not familiar with Korean food. My family loves it and frequent this restaurant. When I was in the area I stopped in for an early dinner. I missed the lunch combo specials- which I would really like to try. The entrees we ordered were delicious! The staff was super friendly and helpful. They took the time to explain the menu options and offer advice. I really appreciate that! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was amazing! Everything that we tried was delicious. Defiantly the best Korean restaurant in north east Ohio that I have tried. I will defiantly be returning!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is friendly. I am a big fan of Korean food, and this is the best restaurant that I found in Cleveland. My favorite dishes are grilled Galbi, spicy squid and pork belly bbq. The side dished are delicious too!"}
{"text":"The best Korean food I've had in Cleveland. It's not as bright and shiny as some of the other newer Korean places, but I'm going there for the food, not for the atmosphere.  The banchan were yummy and they give a pretty impressive variety of dishes.  We ordered the yook gae jang and the jae yook, both were delicious.  I'll be back many times!  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist.  I guess I'll come along if someone wants to go. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
{"text":"Its always the little places that bring my heart and tummy so much warmth, this applies to Seoul definitely. Our waitress was very friendly, wore a smile the whole time and checked if everything was ok just the right amount of times as not to be too pushy. Thanks! My Bibim Bop was excellent as its ever been from anywhere else. I will definitely return to this little structure of joyfulness."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my sister. I am not familiar with Korean cuisine. Our waitress was so helpful  with explaining the menu. We received a bunch of little bowls full of side dishes. The lunch special is a great bargain!"}
{"text":"The galbi's so good that I'm hard-pressed to venture out to other menu items, but whenever I have, it's been real good.  While other places may best Seoul Garden on one or two individual dishes (I do think Korea House has a slightly better bibimbap), SG is definitely the best all-around Korean in town, and no one can beat their selection of banchans--a tasty meal in their own right.  The waitstaff is also among the nicest in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Oh, heck yes, Seoul Garden!   I was as surprised as anyone to find that the finest Korean food in the area can be found in an unassuming storefront in Parma's Pearl Road retail drag, but those are the facts in play, folks. My husband, my parents, and I made our first trip to Seoul Garden yesterday evening and wasted no time getting waist-deep into their menu.   From the Appetizer selection, we opted into a large order of Fried Dumplings (Mahn Dool Gul) and Rice Cakes in Chile Sauce (Ddeik Bok Gi).   The Dumplings were incredible: crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside, and bursting with flavor - you can tell that the dough is homemade.   The Rice Cakes were a new experience for me; the term 'cake' is somewhat misleading here, they are more like a very thick, starchy noodle. The chile sauce was the real draw for me on this dish: bright vermillion color, a jolt of heat with enough smokiness and sweetness to balance it. I may not order again, but it was worth trying!  Our appetites adequately whetted, we moved on to mains: my husband and I were both eager to try their Gop Dol Bi Bim Bap - and we weren't disappointed! The aroma of sesame oil crackling against the hot stone pot that was singeing a crispy crust onto our rice: heaven. The dish was served with a good mix of vegetables, a great fermented chile sauce, and the full bevy of accompaniments that you would expect - all of which were excellent.  The portions here are generous/commensurate with the price point, the service was polite and attentive, and the ambiance was pleasantly simple. I'm looking forward to coming back again and trying some more of what they have to offer, namely the incredible-looking vegetable pancake. I give Seoul Garden an unreserved recommendation!"}
{"text":"The best korean food restaurant in cleveland! Good food with good service! I recommend kkanpungi, ddukbokki, galbi, and sundubu!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the most authentic Korean restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating in. Today was the second visit here and it never fails to disappoint.  Appearance- please, please, PLEASE don't be fooled by the outside!! Frankly it looks like a dump. Inside is clean and rustic.  Staff- super friendly and efficient. They greet you with a cup of warm barley tea!  Food- amazing! I always get the table BBQ because dang it's fun! They give you 8-10 condiments (banchan). It's rustic and uber delicious! The potstickers were light and fluffy and utterly perfect. To round out the dinner, they give you little strawberry yogurt cups.   Reasonably priced, uber delicious, and super fun! A must eat for any adventurous foodie!"}
{"text":"I must try all 103 plus items on their menu.   So should you.  No---I didn't sit there and count every one.  They're numbered and lettered for easy ordering.   After having read Yelp raves, and then looking over their menu at the counter, I knew I'd better start off with something at least a little familiar for my untrained-at Korean-foods-palate.  Preferably, it would be recognizable in appearance and flavor.  Nothing too unusual.   The only Korean I'd ever knowingly eaten were various brands of refrigerated Kim Chee, the Best Egg Rolls in the World made by the Korean mother of a co-worker of mine a few years ago, and a buckwheat noodle dish that I made myself.   I'd start out with something safe.  This first time at a Korean restaurant was not going to be too adventurous, so tripe or cow intestine casserole would be saved for maybe at least the twentieth visit.  Maybe the thirtieth.    The friendly, helpful, young Mr. Kim spoke little English.  I---of course---spoke no Korean.  But with his patient assistance and explanations I settled on number 38.  Fried Rice.  Offered in Beef, Shrimp, or Chicken.  He pointed to Chicken, and smiled.  \"Chicken?  People like?\"  He nodded.  I trusted his smile and his nodding.  At 12.95---about twice what I'd ever paid for fried rice---I hoped it would be good.  (Wanted a buckwheat dish, but---if I understood correctly---the chef was off that day and when he's off, there's no buckwheat noodles.  That was a Thursday.)  Had to have at least another item, but saw no eggrolls listed.  (Maybe that sweet Korean mother was expanding her cooking range beyond her home country.)   Decided on number 2.  Mahn Dou Gui, deep-fried beef dumplings.    Soon it was ready---with another large bonus styrofoam container.  Mr. Kim said it was served with every order.  This was the \"banchan\"---much like a relish or antipasto tray of little extra goodies to nibble.   Yes!  CHICKEN FRIED RICE #38 * * * * * * * * * chicken, rice, shredded fried egg, peas, carrots, onions, with an absolutely wonderful flavor and texture.   Lots of tender, tiny bite-sized well-trimmed chicken---no larger than lima beans---with brightly-colored, fresh-tasting vegetables.  Lower rice ratio to the other ingredients---unlike any other fried rice.  Easily, one of the best Asian dishes I've ever had.   This HAS to be a Korean comfort food.  If not, it's going to be MINE.  DEEP-FRIED BEEF DUMPLINGS #2 * * * * *   fabulous, mild flavor.  By the time I got home the little buggers had deflated.  Limp, half their size, but DELICIOUS!  BANCHAN * * * * *   Complimentary!  FREE !  Tasty treats comprised of radish pickle strips, red cubed daikon, sweetened white potato slices with soy, and two servings of the best Kim Chee ever.  EVER !   (No more jars from the Asian markets for me.  Don't know if theirs is one of those jarred brands, or their own home-made, but will probably buy Seoul Gardens version from now on.  No comparison.)   .  WORTH MENTIONING . . . Don't let the plain, in-need-of-updating, unimpressive grayish blue painted exterior scare you away from pulling into their parking lot. Inside, all appeared neat and clean.  The interior.  Diners did, too.  This is not Black Tie---more Black T-shirt. ."}
{"text":"Seoul Garden used to be my favorite Korean restaurant a few years ago. Now, the dishes have become increasingly expensive and I don't think it is worth the price. Service is average and it is hard to get the server's attention when you need something. They do provide plenty of banchan dishes which is generous. Still, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon due to the plethora of other Korean restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Every time I have Korean food my interest in it is amplified. Seoul Garden pushed me over the edge. I was eating like I've never had these dishes before because everything was so yummy -seafood pancake: stuffed myself. They were generous with the sea food and had yummy onions in it. -soondubu: seafood was delicious, tofu was perfect, entire thing was perfectly spicy  Meal of course was accompanied by traditional side dishes and was finished off with a complimentary yogurt drink dessert which was a favorite from my childhood so they get major points for that."}
{"text":"So it wasn't the best Korean food I've had, but I've been living in LA, but its pretty decent in Cleveland. And so, the 4 stars. Food was tasty, lotsa banchan (even if not all tasted really good), and service was quick if you could get the waitress' attention.  This was my first time coming to this place, unfortunately I was coming from Ridge and totally missed the place. Turning back round makes it easier to find since the sign is facing more toward Brookpark. Haha, its kinda dingy looking on the outside and not clearly marked, but the inside is nice. Decorated with bamboo paneling and everything is nice and clean and makes it all kinda cute looking. They keep it very warm inside during the winter time too.  Service was funny, if you could get the waitress' attention it was good. At one point though I was just waving my arm around trying to get her attention and failed. There was only 2 other tables there so it wasn't like it was ultra busy or anything.  So prices are decent here, soon dubu wasn't too bad, 9 dollars. Pricier than what I'm used to but expected. Banchan was plentiful, some good others not so good.  Banchan list-anchovies, egg thing in stone pot, pickled radishes, tofu, napa kimchi, soy bean sprouts, jop chae, some other type of kimchi etc etc. Quite a bit...some okay, some not so good, but in good supply at least.  I got the soon dubu, which was tasty and in a large proportion, but was just tofu and onions and barely any seafood. Just some little shrimp and 3 pieces of squid and nothing else. The spicyness comes from chili oil and it just sits on top. You can ask for a higher spice level and they just put more chili oil.  So yea I left happy after eating at this place. It's not Koreatown in LA of course, but it was pretty good. I've been spoiled..."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday lunch and I'm already dreaming about the leftovers in the fridge.   The service was excellent and our smiling server was prompt, knowledgeable, and attentive. She was more than willing to answer any questions we had about the dishes. Also, watching her rapid-fire placement of the banchan on the table (so many!) was impressive.  The meal started with hot tea and an assortment of ten different banchan, including pickled daikon, potatoes in a sweetened sauce, a salad with seaweed, steamed egg custard, bean sprouts, spicy squash, seafood in a lightly spiced sauced, and several types of kimchi. They ranged from sweet to savory and included some pungent punches of garlic and heat.   We ordered the seafood pah jeon (seafood pancake), the kahm poong gi (spicy fried chicken), and gopdol bibimbap (mixed rice with vegetables in a hot stone pot). When I visit a restaurant for the first time, I tend to order dishes that are pretty standard just so that I can get a feel for the quality of the ingredients, the preparation, the spice level, etc., so this order wasn't really that adventurous.  The seafood pancake was bigger than my head and full of scallions and big pieces of tender octopus/squid. It was soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. It could have been a meal for two all on its own, but I'm not sad at all that we still have half of it left to snack on!  The spicy fried chicken was incredible. Sizable pieces of boneless fried chicken are tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. I don't know if this is an Americanized version of a Korean dish or if it's really a standard Korean dish. I've never had it anywhere else and I know that some Asian places will cater to the American palate, but either way, I really enjoyed it. The chicken was piping hot, the coating was crisp and crunchy, and the sauce had just the right amount of spice to make me want to keep eating more. There were sliced scallions mixed throughout the sauce and they provided a nice savory-sweet onion bite. With this dish we also took about half of it home.  The bibimbap was exactly what I expected it to be, though I should have let the bottom crisp up a little longer before I mixed everything together. I love the crispy rice bits and it's my own fault that I didn't get as many as I wanted because the stone bowl was plenty hot enough! The gochujang served with it had a good flavor. Overall, I got what I expected with this dish and also took about half of it home.  After we finished what we could of our meal, two tiny Korean frozen yogurt drinks came with our check. They were a nice, sweet surprise to the end of our meal.   I cannot wait to come back to Seoul Garden. It exceeded my expectations, and, having just returned back to Ohio, I'm glad to have found good Korean food in the area. I look forward to trying the kalbi, bulgogi, and some of the casseroles in the future."}
{"text":"My friend recommend this restaurant to us, saying that this would be the best asian restaurant in Cleveland area. Their food was quite traditional and the waiter was super nice. Love the complementary side dishes came with our order. I would give 4.5 if I can."}
{"text":"Having eaten good Korean food, I have to say this wasn't very good. I wish it was because it's close and I'd like to have a good Korean food place close to me. The food was merely average or slightly below. I may have to give it another try though based on MJ K.s review. I might have just gone on a bad day."}
{"text":"If you can get passed the look of this restaurant,  you'll have a great experience.  The food taste and looks amaaaazing. And the amount is .. alot o.o I love this place."}
{"text":"By far the most authentic Korean food in the Cleveland area, and this is coming from someone who lived in Korea during university. Even on weekdays this place is jam packed, and I always expect a wait. They always seem to be slightly understaffed, but you'll have plenty of banchan to hold you over until your meal arrives. Everything I've ever ordered here has been perfect and exactly what I would expect if I would have ordered from a small family restaurant in Seoul. Plus they bring you those tiny yogurts when you're done... And who doesn't love a tiny yogurt?"}
