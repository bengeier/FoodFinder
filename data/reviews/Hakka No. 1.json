{"text":"The reason for my three star rating is the customer service or else I would of rated higher. First time I went to eat there the waitress barely waited on me. No tip for sure and when I call to try to make a delivery they say the delivery man isn't there.. I call bs. When I called for a pick up I was put on hold for 5 mins so I hung up and called back and they took my order immediately... Service is weaaaaaaaaak

the food tho!!!! Never tried indo/Chinese cuisine and this was a good place to start. its delicious which I why I came back even after poor service experience. Portions are huge cant beat that. Most of the time I can't finish.. My fav the Manchurian chicken and its always spicy and good. I recommend for big groups probably get better service than I did. A nice twist to Chinese food as there are many in the area Caribbean heat golden star etc"}
{"text":"Very very good food . portions are huge . lots of flavor . highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well I'm not a person to review but due to the lack of taste and customer service i had to review this place.
i have to say I'm a regular customer here and let me just say their lunch specials don't usually disappoint you might get some burnt fry rice here and there but over all they are really good.
All things aside i decided to give them a try and have them cater my New Years party.
I spent $240 of fry rice, beef and broccoli and general tao Chicken.
I specifically asked the person who took my order to have the kitchen not serve burnt rice but what i was afraid off happend. Burnt rice burnt  Beef & broccoli, my guests left almost all the food behind thats how bad it was.
Decided to give the manager a call which wasn't in at the time left a message for him but I've still have not heard from him.
Moral of the story do not cater from them they are great lunch specials but not catering"}
{"text":"Food is okay. I gave it 3 stars because It was a bit on the salty side but the service is prompt and friendly :)"}
{"text":"The daily lunch special will always attract me to this special. Price for portion is something to never complain about, not to mention it includes a bottle water and a spring roll and it can vary from $8 to $10 depends what you get. I always settle with to the chili chicken with sauce and it always gives a kick to get my nose running in a good way. 

Would recommend for nearby students on a budgets looking for something filling to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"I went there and the service first of all was very slow we ordered after 15min 

Chicken corn soup
Hakka noodles
Chicken manchurian 

First the server brought us plates \"wet plates\" full with water idk why he didn't try to dry them first. He just put them on the table side and went away.

We ask for glass of water and oh boy the glass looked like they never got washed... disgusting 

The chicken corn soup was ok nothing special.
The hakka noodles was ok too.
The chicken manchurian was more salt manchurian then chicken.

Over all it was nothing special.
Won't suggest this place there are better places you can go and have lunch/dinner.

The restaurant didn't even look clean. I think they could do better if they would clean the place better."}
{"text":"We order regularly here, food is good but service is the worst!  The staff are all very rude and seem unhappy or just plain arrogant.  They often take the wrong order or makes some sort of mistakes but they will not compensate the customer for the inconvenience in any way at all.  Not even if you have to wait another 20 minutes because of their own mistake."}
{"text":"Nice food but they treat soya sauce packets like gold. You only get one for each 3 dishes you purchase"}
{"text":"This place is our works go to place for delicious yet very affordable food. The crispy ginger beef and Hakka noodles are the best."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is filling and delicious. The portions are very good and so are the prices. My favourite to order is the fish pakoras, they come with this spicy homemade sauce that is addictive really. I have been going there and ordering in food/ delivery since they opened. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to go if you happen to drive in that area or live close."}
{"text":"Mmm... Special fried rice and bubble tea.  What more could you ask?  This place is fairly busy and there seems to be something for everyone."}
{"text":"Ah Hakka No. 1.

This place. I've gotten delivery from here over like 20 times, and even gone to eat at the restaurant like twice (won't do that again though, its too jane and finch-y for me, #SorryNotSorry)

It's the best Hakka you can get in the area. The portions are HUGE, the prices are cheap, and its filling.

My group of friends (usually we're like 4 - 5 people) always get the hakka meal for 3

Its huge, but we swap out the sweet and sour for manchurian.

Gotta love dat chili chicken thought.
Protip: Ask for it extra spicy and then for extra gravy on the side. 

#DontJudgeMe #WhyAmIUsingSoManyHashtagsInAReview #IThinkIPickedUpThisFrom @KrisU

The fried rice is okay at first, but definitely sucks the next day for some reason.

Delivery is super slow though, takes at least an hour and more.

Only cash or credit on delivery ps.

Oh, and lately their website doesn't work...but I found the menu on 4SQ or something. Look hard young padawan.


Love this place, its filling, delicious, and hakka. Will be ordering soon again.

Just don't expect the best, and you're good to go.

PS LOVE THE BLACK CONTAINERS THEY USE FOR THE CURRIES. Wash them and save them errtime."}
{"text":"Great place and venue the foods are quite good but can be oily. I usually order the black bean sauce ho fun noodles huge portions and can choose spicy level. Parking is sparse and its crazy hour during lunch"}
{"text":"Really good Hakka and other Asian dishes. Options for dry or with gravy, and lots of menu items. We had the fried squid, and shrimp spring rolls. Then manchurian beef (spicy) and general Tao's (not too spicy). The ginger crispy beef was perfect. Hakka shrimp noodles were great, and the fried rice folks really enjoyed that!  Huge portions!  If we're in the area we are for sure coming back!"}
{"text":"Gotta be honest; lot of unhealthy looking customers.  It can be tasty but it generally leaves me (family) feeling pretty gross afterwards.  It's beyond FRIED.  Plus last time a hair in the food, yuck!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC CHICKEN PAKORA's and DRY (crispy) CHILLI CHICKEN.
service is terrible, but hey.... I think we all expect that anyways.

Not a fan of calamari, that was suppose to be deep fried spicy squid. But other two option above are MUT try's."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Everytime I was in Toronto I always made sure to make a trip to this place. Their Bombay fish abd chili shrimp are just delectable! 
I have ordered their bubble tea, but not a fan of it. 
Their service is very fast! 
It is definitely the place I like to say is true Hakka style."}
{"text":"Very neat and nice place to dine in. Food is good and very similar to the taste we get in india. 
We ordered Hakka chicken noodles. It was very nice. Perfectly seasoned. Very nice flavours.
We also order Bombay chicken with fried rice. Chicken was cooked beautifully. It was crisp and decent spicy. Fried rice was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Service is OK. 

Food is delicious. Very flavorful. Portion is big. Family style dining. Affordable. Will likely end up with leftovers. 

Definitely recommend this place if you want flavorful, delicious and affordable food :-)

They have weekdays lunch specials :-)"}
{"text":"I rolled up to this restaurant with a tinge of skepticism. My friend recommended this place, but I just wasn't sure, and the crappily-designed parking lot wasn't helping the situation. None of that mattered, because I quickly learned that the food here was amazeballs.

My date and I ordered the Honey Garlic Chicken Balls, and they were friggin amazing (hence my use of the word \"amazeballs\"). Those deep-fried balls of goodness came in the most rich, thick sauce that was sweetened to perfection. SO GOOD.

We also ordered the House Special Hakka Noodles with chicken, and those were a perfect, savoury complement to our sweet chicken balls. They were a bit too oily for my liking, but absolutely no complaints about the taste.

As you can tell, the food here isn't the healthiest, but this is definitely my go-to Hakka place from now on. Bawse."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've had the one at keele and Lawrence and wasn't a big fan. But maybe it's because I ordered the wrong thing who knows

Hot and sour soup it's really dark but has a great sour spicy taste

Vegetarian black bean sauce chow mien food ratio between noodles and veggies and good amount of sauce then noodles were crispy as well :) 

I'll be back price is good as well"}
{"text":"Not the greatest Hakka restaurant

Manchurian fried rice was salty
Hakka noodles was bland
Bombay chicken no flavor
Honey garlic chicken was okay
Ginger beef was okay but not crispy

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I went here and ordered chilli chicken regular size with less gravy. I got it filled with gravy, I asked if they could give me another one with less gravy. They said yes, I drove back there and they said that they couldn't give me another one because I already mixed the rice with the chicken. I just left the meal there, and left. This place needs better customer service."}
{"text":"I love the food at Hakka no 1. It is so tasty abs affordable too! My go fish are the mango salad and green curry chicken! love love love. I have severe food allergies and can always trust eating here."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions.

Place looks okay for the area and price point.

My one complaint is that they rushed us out right when it was closing time. I guess they really want to go home.

Other than that, pretty satisfying"}
{"text":"Love this place, hate to admit it! I've been here several times with my family and with friends. The decor is decent (the Keele location looks much better). The service is decent, with waiters taking your orders, but that's all they do. However, all this aside, the food is just amazing. I'm not sure how they cook it or with what, but this place always manages to produce amazingly fresh tasting dishes in a short amount of time. 

I've tried several dishes from this restaurant, and there hasn't been a dish so far that I disliked! Superb! 

Be sure to drop by Hakka No 1 for their lunch special, which includes a choice of chicken/beef/veggie/fish dishes with rice/noodles + a pop and a spring roll for about $6! And it's a huge portion! Always leaves you full and leaves you extra to take home, aka the best part hehe. 

I haven't been here in a LONG time due to my new healthy lifestyle, but it was a family favourite, so I recommend it to families. 

Overall, decent service, amazing food + prices."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with a delicious menu and reasonable price! It's good food and the quantity of the meal is amazing. I've never actually been able to finish it all, even when I've gone with friends.
Oh and they have THE BEST BUBBLE TEA! For only $2.95 I believe. It's delicious and in many flavours.
The only reason I won't give it a 5 star is the service. There are maybe 3-4 people in all, and they are cooking and serving at the same time. On a busy day, the service is very slow."}
{"text":"There not in the nicest area nor is it a pretty restaurant .. but the food OMGGG !
Just go for the food and enjoy the unique clientele!

EVERYONE HAS TO AT LEAST ONCE TRY THE CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS! I could eat 100 of those for dinner. 

The chilli chicken delicious with the beef stir fried rice . The flavours are mouth watering! 

HUGE PORTIONS!

Very friendly man serving us.
Place was busy!
Very very casual!"}
{"text":"Bought food about 2 weeks ago, it suck!!! Oil!! So much oil in the food it was dripping yuk!!! Tasted horrible!!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time here last night. Normally I do the drive to Fredricks in Markham but after just getting back from Windsor and just completing a  3 1/2 drive....the thought of driving to Markham from Vaughan was just not appealing.
Types Hakka Food on the Yelp search line and this place popped up. Location was convenient (straight down the 400 and a right on Finch....a 12 minute drive from home). Thanks to this visit, I now have another option for Hakka other than Fredricks.
First off, this place is not fancy by any means. The décor is dreadful (plastic, dusty plants), old tables, cafeteria style seating.....but you're not here for the décor.
We started with Chicken Pekoras...they were spicier than those I'm accustomed too, but excellent non the less. You get 10 for around $9 and they are worth every penny.
We also ordered a rice dish (Manchurian Rice) and Chili Chicken with Gravy (you have the option of getting them dry). All were excellent and the rice was very spicy (Yah !).
The waitstaff were excellent....brought over a menu very quickly once we were seated and returned frequently to check on us.
All in all....despite the décor and loud atmosphere (a table arrived after we were 20 minutes into our meal who were VERY loud and disruptive)...we will return.
Food order, plus 2 drinks (water and pop), with tax, came to $30. Excellent value."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sweet and sour chicken. I sometimes randomly crave this place because it's so good. The staff is okay and the kitchen is kind of slow sometimes because it's ALWAYS busy but i'd wait for the food!"}
{"text":"simply Hakka food. No surprises. Very good portion size. I really liked their dry chilli check as i have never had that before. Lunch special is awesome! i could not finish it!"}
