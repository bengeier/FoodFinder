{"text":"Taste of Korea - Absolutely amazing true to it's name. Tried the Bibimbap Beef Bulgogi & Grilled Chicken. Hospitality by Paul was fantastic. Will definitely go again to try other items."}
{"text":"I used to live in this area so when I passed by and realized that I had never eaten here before I just had to check it out.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.    The outside looks like your typical Japanese/Korean restaurant owned by Koreans.  My experience with these types of places is not too bad but nothing special.  The inside is even worse.  No decor and reminds me of how family owned restaurants looked like in the 80's. If I were to describe the decor I'd say brown, yellow and beige.    The food on the other hand is actually pretty decent.  Mind you, I didn't order the sushi like some of the other reviewers on here (given the traffic I wouldn't expect the sushi to be fresh anyways).  I ordered teriyaki chicken which included a couple of gyoza's.  Not much you can do to differentiate gyoza's but the teriyaki chicken was very good as they cook and serve it to you on a hot plate which gives the actual chicken a good flavor while better soaking in the flavor from the sauce.  The sauce is great as it tasted teriyakiyish without the generic teriyaki sauce flavor.  I find at even some of the most expensive restaurants the chicken is basically flavorless with the generic teriyaki sauce contributing to all the flavor.  Next time I come here I will try the more Korean dishes (Bulgogi, Kalbi, chap chae) as some of the patrons around me ordered these dishes which looked really good!  Also tried the kim-chi friend rice.  A little bit oily and not up to par with some of the Korean restaurants I've eaten at Koreatown but decent nonetheless and garnished well.    I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had the ultimate sushi and pizza. Very flavourful and presentation is colourful and unique. Did not like the green onion as a topping, but enjoyed the rainbow sushi roll. Filling and tasty!! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is a total hidden gem. Outstanding service, I will be back for a 2nd time this week. There is a reason for the consistent strong reviews"}
{"text":"After reading reviews and looking for an inexpensive but good quality Korean or sushi meal, we settled on this place. Such a good choice! The atmosphere is underwhelming but the food and fantastic service certainly aren't.   Only one chef preparing the food but the server was in high gear, kept our tea filled and the yummy condiments (snacks) coming.   I had the sushi and my partner had the bibimbap. Solid meals, delicious and filling. Looking around, I saw several other meals I'd like to try.  Great service, really good food and fantastic value. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was a great surprise. The food was great and the staff was very friendly. I brought my kids there and they loved it. We ordered the international role, salmon teriyaki and beef teriyaki. The quantity was plenty and we took some home. The atmosphere was very warm and the staff was attentive and smiled with my kids every time they walked by.  Would definitely recommend it to bring a date and as a family place."}
{"text":"The worst kimchi tofu soup I've ever had! I am surprise I even give a 1 star...I guess it's for the service...never going back!"}
{"text":"This place in the caf of pacific mall is totally slept on! The service is great and they treated us so nicely. The guy brought our ice water so fast, I was appalled. This place does hit the spot for a Korean place in a cafeteria!!"}
{"text":"Went here today on a whim and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki ($17). In the past, I've always received a small salmon portion and large sides eg. Kimchi, bean sprouts, etc but it was the exact opposite! Good flavour and cook to the fish. A little pricey but service was quick and servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Very lack luster, but very impressed by the service. If you don't feel like eating in the busy and dirty food courts of Pmall, then highly reccomend. Its a nice break from being yelled at in broken english. The server was very friendly and the food came in minutes.I ordered the bimbimbap, which was a very generous portion for $11, but it did lack in flavour. However, there is refillable banchan, which also wasnt that great. All in all, decent korean food, and a nice spot to eat thats not the food court."}
{"text":"Taste of Korea is a little gem hidden in the etobicoke area for sushi. Yes, I've ate at a lot of the different sushi spots here in the area since I work here. This spot though wins the gold.  They have an extensive menu for both Korea and Japanese food. And everything I've had has been a treat. One of the best things about eating Japanese food in a Korean establishment is that you also get korean side dishes and miso soup at the same time. I always come here for their lunch special bento. I like to order the LB3 sushi and sashimi bento. It's a delight because you get a great amount of food for $10.99 which includes sashimi , sushi, spring rolls , salad, miso soup, and side dishes .  The sushi chef, Max is passionate about his work and it shows in the sushi. Check this place out as it will definitely be a treat!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you! This place does some mean sushi at a really sweet price!   My studio is down the street, so I come here for the lunch specials weekly. The bento boxes are packed full of good stuff and range from $10-13 dollars with tax. I also recommend the \"Salmon Fiesta Roll\" and if you come really hungry, the \"International Roll\" will blow you mind. The price and quality of the ingredients here put most downtown sushi places to shame. Max and Co. are super nice and run a great restaurant!   Anyways, if you find yourself in the area, check out this hidden gem, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday, around 1:30 pm. We waited about 5 minutes for a table, only 1 of the 5 waiters acknowledged us even though they all zoomed by us several times while we stood by the entrance.  My friend and I were very pleased by the big variety of both Korean and Japanese dishes on the menu. The prices were all very good (low) as well!  I ordered the salmon sushi bento and my friend the beef yaki udon. We received miso soups and Korean side dishes. My friend's entr√©e arrived quickly, but I waited an additional 10 minutes before mine did. Despite the way we both really enjoyed our lunch. The sushi in my bento was fresh and tasted great. The portion was perfect and I was satisfied.  I would have lunch here again if I was at the mall!"}
{"text":"Food (not counting the fried fish in my bento box) was slightly below average at best.   As for service? Worst. Service. Ever. The server that I had barely made eye contract or spoke to me. The food took a while to arrive and when it finally arrived, the inside of the deep fried fish that came in my bento box was so raw on the inside that you can practically hear Gordon Ramsay making a joke about it. I tried several times to let my server know about the fish but she flat out ignored me (she gave me eye contact and kept talking to her colleagues). I called on a different server and explained to him the situation. He ended up getting the original server to come to my table. She just took my bento box without a word and gave it to the kitchen staff. From my table, I can make out what was going on inside the kitchen. Everyone was yelling at one another and I saw what appeared to be the head chef trashing the bento box in a really dramatic way. I ended up getting a different server afterwards, a fresh plate of sushi on the house (I watched the staff preparing the sushi just in case) and I was not charged extra for the bento box that I ordered.   Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this establishment. The staff (not counting the one server that I had after the bento box fiasco) were rude and the food was badly cooked. I do not recommend anyone coming here. You're better off going to one of the several restaurants surrounding the mall than coming here."}
{"text":"First off, AMAZING SERVICE! The waiter was so friendly and super quick with service. They came around pretty frequently to refill or tea and water.  The food was also pretty bomb! I ordered the chicken fired rice which sounds average, but the amount of spice and flavoring that went into it made it just great!  I also had a yam roll which was pretty good. Essentially at the standards of any other good sushi place in town.   Overall the bill came to about $20 with tax and tip which wasn't bad.   The overall aesthetics of the restaurant was pretty nice for a small place in the upper level of pacific mall. In total, this was my second visit, but I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch because of this tasty sign saying $12.99 all you can eat pork bone soup. Being a huge lover of pork bone this was truly divine. The soup broth was simmered right and the meat was literally fall off the bone.   Overall really tasty at the time and will visit again."}
{"text":"great service. good food. never busy. This is my go to restaurant if I am hungry and around the area."}
{"text":"Great service! I had the chicken bulgogi bento and it was really good. Chicken was well seasoned and the sides were not greasy. Their kimchi tastes very unique (quite sour) but I really like how refreshing it tastes. My friend had the special jjeomangg (sp?) and I tried its soup and it was delicious. Pretty good prices for a sit-down restaurant! Servers were really friendly and accommodating. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Friendly, happy, sociable and attentive staff! Sushi is good and fresh here if u looking for quick bite at the mall. Good choice if the other food court choices are rammed. I ordered the salmon bento for $11 and it was filling. Felt like dinner portions. Definitely a place to bring a bigger party. They have larger tables that can fit 6 or even 8."}
{"text":"Great little gem. The decor is nothing to sing about but the food is top notch and all the dishes are usually 10$ or less. Everything I have ordered has been delicious. The menu has good variety and as with many traditional Korean restaurant they include the various appetizer dished of KimChee, Chilli Seaweed, Sweet Soy Sauce Potatoes and Bean Sprouts. My co workers and I come here at least twice a week for lunch and no one has ever had a bad thing to say about this place. Great Food, Friendly Service, Affordable. Can you tell I really like this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup is the best!!!! Servers are nice and friendly, Clean and well-lit place"}
{"text":"Best bibimbap I've ever had! For $9.99, I love how I can customize the type of rice, the protein and the sauce. For those who can't eat the spicy hot sauce that normally comes with bibimbap, the citron soy sauce is perfect. I got the grilled chicken option and it was delicious! The meat was tender and had a nice grilled smokey taste. The red/black rice was also different than the typical white rice (more of a purple rice).  The second time I went I tried the deep fried tofu bibimbap with soybean/hot sauce which is milder, more flavourful and thicker than the regular hot sauce.  There is free street parking on Sunday's, and also a free parking lot in the back of the restaurant with a back entrance.   Great service, both waiters and owners were very friendly and conversational with their customers and let us stay after our meal for a few hours while offering us tea. Overall the meal, including the side dishes, were delicious.  A+ for service!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant located on the second floor of Pacific Mall.  This place has a dark \"wood\" decor that definitely makes it stand out from the usual food court place.  It's a Korean place, so you can get some of the more mainstream Korean dishes, but they also serve Sushi and teriyaki dishes.  This time I opted for sushi.  Had a few rolls and they were good. The usual suspects showed up -  California rolls, spicy salmon and dynamite rolls (shrimp tempura and california roll essentially).  Since it's a Korean place, they bring out kim-chi and daikon radish and other korean stuff.   Not much else to say.  It's a solid 3."}
{"text":"Parents, hubby & I had a great lunch experience here while browsing the stores at Pacific Mall. Decor as Dave W wrote is dark wood. Looks classier than the cafeteria type seating at the other fast food locations here. I liked that the kitchen was open on the one side & could watch everyone doing their duties. It was like watching a well-oiled machine. On the menu they have Thai, Chinese, Japanease & Korean food, though it is Korean run. So yes, we did get the traditional Korean appetizers of Kimchi, bean sprouts, sea weed, potatoes & glass noodles.   Food ordered: Korean Chicken (w/ noodles), Lemon Chicken , Sizzling Chicken & Salmon Bento. OMG! The Lemon Chicken which hubby had was the best both of us ever tasted. The lemon sauce must be their own make. It's definitely not the goey gelatinous mess that is usually served as lemon sauce at other restaurants. Mom had the Korean Chicken which is actually a noodle dish & she asked for mild spice. But even mild spice was too much for her. That's saying a lot because she can take mild to medium spice. Non-spicey eaters take note! You'll need a hanky to wipe the sweat off your face! ;-)  All of our entrees were from $10.99 to $11.99 & came with miso soup & rice except for my mom's noodle dish which just came with the soup.  We were all very satisfied with our meals. Service was good as well. We had a young Korean man as our waiter & he brought everything we asked for promptly & with a smile. When my mom ordered take out he even looked very pleased that she was doing so. We'll come back here again!"}
{"text":"Today I had a sudden craving for kimchi and Korean barbecue. Normally for take away, I would browse the menu online so I can call in my order ahead, but I couldn't find their menu so I just headed there. The staff were very pleasant and accommodating from the moment I walked in. One was sensitive enough to see that I was struggling with the menu so he offered his assistance. I ended up choosing the grilled gal-bi and shrimp stir-fry which he both recommended. I also couldn't resist adding chapchae noodles or vermicelli as their menu says. As I waited, they offered me hot tea, which was better than most Asian restaurants I know. There's actually tea in there and not just colored hot water. It took about 15 minutes waiting time which was reasonable-- meaning my order is fresh and not just hanging around the pantry. I noticed however, that the spoon and metal chopsticks on the table were not as sparkling clean as I would have liked, but then again maybe they're just overused. At home, my husband and I enjoyed our meal. I've tried kimchi in other places but for some reason, I like theirs best so far. Generally I also like how Korean meals have a lot of vegetables and interesting appetizers. I'll be coming back to try their Japanese dishes, and maybe dining in would be better so I can have more of those appetizers and lots of kimchi."}
{"text":"A holiday Monday and we totally slacked on getting groceries so we were looking for a place for dinner.  Had a craving for Korean food so checked out Taste of Korea.  This place is a lot bigger than it looks on the inside.  The decor is decidedly peche with every wall painted a cheery salmon/peach colour.  We ordered the grilled beef with rice ($8.99) and the bi bim bap ($8.99).  Food came in an average amount of time, along with 5 choices of small side dishes.  Food arrived hot and fresh.  Ventilation is not great in the place so be prepared to leave reeking of grilled meat.  It will explain why a pack of dogs is trailing closely behind you on the way home."}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times and finally decided to stop. Order 3 items to go: Korean grilled beef (comes with rice and some stir fry bean spouts on the bottom), dynamite roll (8 pieces), and shrimp tempura. Everything was delicious and the staff were super friendly.  I waited for about 13 mins considering the sushi chef had to run out to get groceries, but the guy at the counter offered me tea while waited for my food. Also, the sushi chef had made me a free California hand roll for the long wait - it was nice of him to do that.  Don't let the outside appearance fool you because the food was so yummy. I will definitely return soon.  There is on Green P street parking, but if you don't want to pay, there is also a parking lot in the rear. It's kind of hidden. But if you park at the rear, you can also enter the restaurant from the back entrance."}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi bento for 9.99 and it was decent, not very filling. The server was pleasant, offered to give us more sides but I declined because we already had a generous portion of kimchi, potato, and bean sprouts. The miso soup was mild-tasting, not flavourful or salty, which was fine with me.  Overall, good portion for the price and kind service."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite.  Large space, modern industrial looking tables and chairs.  Down to the sushi. Since toku Gawa was closed, I've been searching for fresh sushi in this part of Etobicoke and Taste of Korea. Its not the freshest but I ate it.  $34 with tax and tip."}
