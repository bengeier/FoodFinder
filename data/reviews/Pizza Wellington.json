{"text":"Wow. So many flies and bugs crawling all over the place here. And this was just while waiting for my food in front. Who knows what kind of stuff is lurking in the back kitchen. Gross."}
{"text":"Ordered their pizza from the delivery counter, and it was ready in about ten minutes. Pizza was baked in a heated pizza oven, contrary to the wood fired oven I initially thought.  It's hard to screw up pizza, and the smoked meat pizza was quite good and generous with loads of cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"This place has zero online footprint aside from a listing on Google Maps, but they make good chicken wings which is a surprising rarity in Montreal, even among places that advertise it as their main focus (I'm looking at you, Buffalo Bill). Haven't tried their pizza but on the basis of their wings I'm going to give them 4 stars."}
