{"text":"Worst idea ever.  I would NOT recommend this place for anyone, at any time. They are over staffed, yet somehow the service is rotten - perhaps because all of the employees seem more interested in chatting amongst themselves while hiding in a clump behind the counter. When I asked to order a sandwich, I was told there was no menu. Great. After a long pause in which the employee stared at me blankly, she suggested that I order a chicken sandwich. having literally nothing else to choose from, I went for it.  Without any mention if a price the girl took my order and vanished. I went over to the cash to pay and found out it would be a $9 sandwich. What??!! I was shocked, but figured it might be amazing, so I'll give it a shot. Surprise, surprise. While the bun was fresh, the sandwich had a single tiny piece of lettuce, two unripe tomato slices, and some canned mushrooms jammed in. It tasted bland, with a hint of something scrapped off the bottom of the grill. Just miserable. $9 later, I downloaded the Yelp app for no other reason than to write this review. Hopefully someone reads this before they ruin their day with a crappy meal. Again, I strongly suggest avoiding this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"Bought 6 natas yesterday to serve guests with breakfast this morning. So embarrassed, unacceptable they sold me these hard stale pastry. Can't chew through them!"}
{"text":"Was there recently picking up Portuguese tarts for the coworkers. Definitely regular customers there when I dropped by. Picked up some corn buns and tarts and my co-workers loved me!

The crust was slightly chewy and the custard wasn't too sweet, great warmed up for 10 seconds. 

Best I've ever had? Nope but definitely worth the proximity and price. 

Friendly service as well!

Lots of options when you're there, glad I didn't look on yelp before I pulled in!"}
