{"text":"I don't  eat a lot of donairs or shawarma, so I can't say there's not better out there... but I'd be willing to bet a chicken shawarma wrap that these guys make the best!!!

Firstly this place is always busy once noon hits. Secondly if you come after the lunch rush they've usually sold out of the chicken! Which happened once and I could've cried because  I love it so much.

Start with a soft pita wrap and throw in tender chicken, combined with garlic sauce and sweet sauce! I also throw in lettuce cheese and black olives! The sweet sauce is so good I actually licked the paper wrapping once. Too bad I just shared that with all yelpers out there haha.

If you're in the mood for tasty donair, falafel or highly recommended chicken shawarma,  try this place!

(I can't comment on price because I haven't actually tried another shawarma place, but my large wrap  is 10.99)"}

{"text":"I've got good news and bad news. You want the bad news first, you say? Well that's a little negative of you to want to start there, but here it is: I was hungover, hungry and my phone was dead. That's right, people... No Yelp. But just hold on, here's the good news and it's going to come at you in two parts. 

1. I was at Tool Shed Brewery, which is a freaking great place. You can get tours of the facility and buy their beer fresher than fresh. 

2. I asked the guys if they could recommend some quick and easy takeout or fast food that wasn't an international chain.

Well folks, the boys at Tool Shed Brewery came to my rescue on both fronts that day. Not only did they save me with some epic within walking distance shawarma, they had some fresher than fresh hair of the dog ready for me when I got back.

TL;DR - Clean, fast efficient friendly shawarma and donair stop. Lots of comfy booths for eating in. Seemed a little pricey considering some of the wilty looking veg, but lots of choice and very filling as shawarma and donairs often are. Don't drink from the cans if you buy a can of pop, they're disgustingly dirty. 

...Not like Tool Shed's Beer with the super awesome debris deterring, seagull saving six pack lids. Still, this donair shop is pretty grand. Glad to have it as a quick lunch stop when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered take our for lunch at our office. The food was excellent. A bit pricey - beef donair is 15.99! 

We ordered 7 meals. 4 out of 7 were completely wrong. We ordered an hour before lunch to make sure they got it right and had then repeat it back to us. We ordered 3 chicken meals, 3 mixes, and one beef. We in turn got 3 beefs, 3 chicken and beefs, and 1 chicken. We also asked them to mark the wraps so we can read them, which they did not do. 

Food is great but don't expect to get what you ordered. They totally messed up our order. Also, it's a tiny place"}
{"text":"Way over priced. $9.50 for a regular shawarma. Stingy with toppings. Try cedars deli for a real shawarma."}
