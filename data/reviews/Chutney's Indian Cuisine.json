{"text":"My wife has eaten in Indian restaurants all over the world. We have tried at least 10 different dishes. They are consistent, the service is great, the food is delicious with a balance of flavors and spiciness, & it feels like the owner sincerely cares about the quality of the food and satisfaction of his patrons."}
{"text":"Every Indian Restaurant in the valley starts with lot of promise and will go down with the time. Here is another one with same traits. When started everything is rosy and great attention to the detail and respect to the customers? As time goes on, they think they are pioneers of the business start showing attitude. We are there for the dinner, ordered Goat Biryani, the meat is not tender and my kid commented that meat is slippery and rubbery; she is only four year old. You need to have strong teeth to eat. The chicken curry is actually smelly and it has some raw chicken feel to it. If they choose to ignore the signs it's sure will go down and history will repeat.  I agree with other reviewer Rand H about Buffet comments. The chicken Biryani served in the buffet is pale not tasty at all. I completely agree about the styrofoam cups nothing upscale about it.  Nan placed at the buffet is not warm, and service is OK.  Unlike other Chutney restaurants in the country(been to one in portland) they don't offer any chutnies at the dinner table as a complimentary. I was excited to hear they are opening one in Tempe with the name chutney, but looks like it's an empty promise."}
{"text":"My wife and I took my mother-in-law out to dinner here and we all loved it!  We walked in and the restaurant was nice and clean,  the service was fantastic, and the food was authentic and delicious.  Everyone involved genuinely cared that we had an amazing experience and it showed all the way around.  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"In many other Indian restaurants, I have been quietly offered what seemed like implied, free, options to my order only to find out that turned into costly additional items on the receipt.  Chutney's did no such thing. That alone gets 5 stars.  I first went here with my wife and a dear friend who months later passed away. It was a sad occasion and we did not return because of the association to Chutney's.  After a *year* we returned because we were in the area and the manager recognized us and welcomed us back! That is *service*. He remembered our friend and seemed genuinely saddened by his passing as it was his favorite place for Indian cuisine.  I like coming here for dinner, because I can ask for exactly how spicy I would like it. Chutney's makes it hot.. so deliciously hot I have only had few that can compare. My wife and I come here often."}
{"text":"Very delicious Veggie dishes for everyone in our family!  We came here for dinner and were extremely pleased with the level of spiciness and the overall flavor.  Not too salty like dishes in some other Indian restaurants. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We went to Chutney's for early dinner, they served very cold food and was not at all fresh . Even the service was slow."}
{"text":"A modest little place worth checking out. Very clean, nice interior. It seems that Indian restaurants have either an over the top design with big floral drapes and bronze whatnots, or they'll be a bit on the trashy side. 80's, diner style tables and Bollywood TVs. Chutney's was right in the middle. Comfortable, inviting.  I love that they mark what is and isn't vegan which is something a lot of Indian restaurants don't do which can make ordering a pain in the butt. Especially if the servers don't have very good english.  I had the veg vindaloo which was very good. A bit more watery than the vindaloo I'm used to, but it's forgivable. I really like a thick gravy in all my curries, which this didn't really have. The spice level was perfect. Lots of crisp cauliflower and toothsome potatoes & chickpeas. This would easily be a 4 star if not for 2 things:  a.) Despite the dinning area being near abandoned, service was slow. I was in for perhaps 15 minutes before I got my drink order in. There's really no excuse for that. b.) They didn't bring me rice with my vindaloo. We ordered 3 curries and only two plates of rice came out.  So, there you have it. Perhaps I came in on a bad night, but I feel the wait staff could use some improvement. With that, I think it could be one of the best Indian joints in the valley. I'll be returning and will adjust my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Inconsistent is an understatement. The first time my husband and I came here the food was great and the service was very attentive. The only complaint was the ridiculous pricing for the tiny ration of food. This time around the service was extremely slow and lacking which doesn't make sense for a not busy Saturday dinner service at a restaurant. My husband had to get up to ask for a beer. He also then had to get up a second time to get a cold glass for the beer. It also took forever to get our appetizer. The appetizer came out just a handful of minutes before the meal.  Now the first time I ate here the aloo gobi was great. Portion was small, but it was a flavorful assortment of cauliflower and potato and tomato.  This second time around, the aloo gobi was watery, bland, and at the most there were two little bits of potato and hardly any cauliflower. The rest of the mixture was just straight up red onion. Not to forget, there was absolutely no spice. I ordered it medium and got ridiculous bland. I also don't think it helped that the food was served lukewarm.  Not sure the hubby and I will be back after the two extremely different experiences we had."}
{"text":"The dishes are tasty. More varieties than many ofthe Indian Buffets offer. Dosa's are the best. Would definitely go back. let's chutney!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food every time we eat here for dinner. The food is fantastic and we haven't ordered anything we haven't loved. The garlic naan is fresh and delicious. Overall the restaurant offers a wide variety of Indian cuisine at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I visited in recent times. Food was full of spice and chilies and taste horrible. Don't ever come here if you are looking for authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law and her boyfriend took my husband and I here last week. The staff were very nice and professional and were quick on the drink refills. We ordered papadam, Gobi 65, chili paneer, and I think it was the malai kofta. My husband and I had never had Indian food before, so we basically went into everything blind. We definitely were not disappointed! The food came out very quickly and it was absolutely delicious! I'm not one for spicy foods but what we ordered was just the right amount of spice and there was a ton of flavor! Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went there after a long gap. This place rocks, food is excellent all the way around. Even the Drinks, appetizers and then desserts and coffee are full of flavor. Thanks Anjani for a very good experience."}
{"text":"I had written a review about my experience at this restaurant over the Diwali weekend. The review is missing - I am not sure how but I did get an e-mail  from the owner stating that they will take good care of me next time. They also wanted me to read all the good reviews which are posted.  If bad reviews are filtered  -then all reviews will be good. The owner  should work on improving the quality of your food not just filtering bad  reviews. I would like to  give details about my food I had on Diwali weekend.    Gobi Manchurian - I wanted it to be spicy - they added Sri-Racha sauce to  dish which overpowered  everything else. Mango Lassi - It was so thick we could not drink it with a straw. kids would not drink it . Kothu parotta - this was on the Diwali special menu - wanted it spicy - so they added green chillies which were  raw. every bite had raw fennel seeds.  I have  visited this restaurant in the past and food was much better. But I was disappointed this weekend."}
{"text":"I went to chutneys for a lunch buffet recently, especially liked the Chettinad Chicken which was a stand out, also liked the Pongal, other items was Ok. Would definitely go back in the near soon."}
{"text":"Food was great, the closest to authentic Indian food in town. I had the lamb biryani and it was so good l."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The owner is a nice guy and walks around to his customers whenever he is around. The food is great and they do try really hard not be just another Indian buffet.  The problem really is customer service. They have a new guy on the floor and I went at 2:20 PM yesterday.  He told me point blank that the buffet will be closed at 2:40 PM and I have to eat in 20 mins. No restaurant will ask you to \"eat\" in 20 mins. They will just ask you to make sure you take all that you need from the buffet in 20 mins and finish within a reasonable time. where do they get these \"bozos\" from? My wife just reminded me that he mentioned we have to pick up everything we need in \"5 mins\". Are we near Armageddon?  First of all, the advertisement says buffet is open till 3 PM. He was damn rude and reminded me of my hostel warden in India. I am a regular customer and go there at least once a week, sometimes with customers.    It is ironical that they got a new guy to fix the problem and he is only making things worse."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food we have had in a long time. My husband has eaten in Indian restaurants all over the world, including India, and ranks Chutney's easily in his top 5. Service was great, food delicious,and complete satisfaction.  Run, don't walk to go there when next in Tempe!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian food in the valley.  The chef continuously turns out new fantastic dishes.  You will not find the typical Indian dishes here. The variety is enough to satisfy meat lovers and vegans.  Always the freshest ingredients. The Sunday buffet is to die for.  We held a special event in their private room and they really went out of their way to cater to us, which made the evening even more special.   We haven't found any better Indian restaurant than this!"}
{"text":"5 star! I was driving to Phoenix from Tucson and wanted some good Indian food. I am so glad we decided to go to Chutneys. My fiance got the butter chicken and it was pretty close to the authentic Hyderabadi butter chicken I so missed. I got the mysore masala dosa which came with TWO chutneys and thick, flavorful sambhar that was almost as good as my Mom's sambhar. We shared a medu vada to start, and it was crisp and delicious as well. Since I was such a fan already, I decided to take some chicken manchuria and fried rice to go for the next day. I haven't eaten Indian chinese food since my trip to India the previous year, and I was so satisfied that I am willing to drive to Phoenix just for dinner sometime to appease my homesickness. The wait staff was friendly, and the decor very inviting. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was great. Made my first experience with this type of cuisine a good one."}
{"text":"When it opened up, Chutneys was one of the better Indian lunch buffets in the Phoenix metro area. The variety on offer was superb -- both South and North Indian dishes -- and the dessert menu was delectable.   However, in the recent past -- a couple of months at the very least -- the variety on offer has sharply dwindled. Where once the entire buffet slate used to be full of different dishes, now the desserts (sweets) take up about one-third of the original buffet space.   Added to the high price of the weekend lunch buffet (north of $13 per person), Chutneys has become a very poor choice indeed. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes before visiting this restaurant as I heard great reviews from my friends. But I'm sorry to say that it disappointed me. I found a metal wire in the appetizer I ordered. When I told the service person about it, he just said okay and went inside (which is so contrary to any other decent restaurant). Besides, though the food was good, the service completely sucked. The waiter made faces when we asked for something else. All in all, I didn't feel welcoming in this place. I am leaving as a highly unsatisfied customer and would probably not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, better management and new dishes. More on the fancy side with a little extra $$ on the bill. You can think of it as a better version of \"curry corner\" restaurant. Give their garlic bread and a dish with butter in it  a try."}
{"text":"Love the Vegetable Biryani! They even customized it for my special needs. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Don't let the lack of people in here fool you. I am often intrigued by restaurants with lines out the door (it MUST be good!) but this place is totally misunderstood. I fear it going out of business because it may not be the best location. And they don't really market. At all. Typically though, these are the places that I admire most because the food and service speak for itself. I've dined in more times than I can count and take out has been a breeze too. Garlic cauliflower is something I dream about. I drove from central Phoenix for it last night. These servers really do care about the business. I really do love butter chicken even though my server last night told me it's actually from a British chef. Not really Indian at all. So he recommended some more traditional dishes. Absolutely love their heart and amazing food."}
{"text":"The food was really dilisious and great taste, the nan was tasty and soft, the chicken ticka masala is fantastic, however they took 30 minuets to bring the food"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time today. (9/20/12). Quite a drive from North Valley, but the food was totally worth it. Tasty, and well presented. I am a vegetarian, decided to eat the Idli-Vada combo. The sides-coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and Sambar- were beautifully presented in 3 small bowls, separately. Idlis usually dont make it on my \"to-eat\" dishes at any restaurant, because by evening they dry out. But these were soft and fully cooked. The Medhu Vada was done perfectly. Crispy, crunchy, and tasty. I also had samosas, and the accompanying chutneys( tamarind sweet chutney, and cilantro mint) were tasty too. My husband, found South Indian style Chicken Sukha( dry ), and enjoyed it immensely. The Egg biryani was also quite tasty. Rice was fully cooked, and they give quite a generous portion. Price wise, probably same or at par with most other Indian restaurants in the valley. Non veg dishes come at 10.95 to 11.95. and whatever I had was under 12 dollars. The staff told me that their buffet spread is extensive, and weekends they offer more variety.   Definitely a Must try!!! We will go back again, if possible."}
{"text":"We tried Chutneys for the first time last night & I was very impressed. When we first walked in I noticed that it was very clean and the food smelled so good.  The service was very friendly and attentive. The food was presented beautifully & was delicious...so much so that my friend & I had to pause our conversation.  The rosemary naan and butter chicken were my favorites from the dishes we ordered. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After staying away from this place for 2.5 months, we decided to give it one last try. We have been back thrice since. We now really like the food here, mainly south indian, haven't had time to try other stuff. Dosas, Uthappams, Idiyappam (rice noodles), Kurma are all very good. Loved the Gobi Manchurian, but not a fan of the fried rice served with it. Parotta was very hard and oily. Service has definitely improved, but could be better. 3.5 stars overall. If you don't know what to get, dosas are the safest and tastiest option :)"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. I went for the lunch buffet and was pretty much blown away by it. The chutney, paneer, and butter chicken were particularly good. I found the cilantro rice a little bit odd because it was green, but it tasted fine regardless. I was also a little disappointed that the buffet didn't include samosas, but that's really more of a nitpick. My only real complaint (and what's keeping this place from 5 stars) was the price. $14 for a lunch buffet is a bit steep in my opinion - plus they ask for a tip. I don't normally tip at buffets but I was too intimidated to not leave one as I had to do that right in front of the cashier. I've been searching the valley for the best Indian food, and my search for what can top Kohinoor continues. This place is as close as anyone has gotten, though."}
{"text":"Food is pricey but not anywhere close to good taste or quality. We ordered Veg Uttapam and Masala Dosa. Both of them were a total disaster. The veg uttapam had no tomato, onion and was so thick and uncooked. The Masala in the dosa had no salt at all. Usually if I don't like the dosa or uttapam, I stay calm if I get a good enough Sambhar. But yesterday it was just the opposite. Sambhar was even worser than the dosa and uttapam. There was no taste whatsover. It felt like drinking some masala water.  This was not our first time. We tried their buffet as well 6 months back. We were disappointed then as well. Chicken and potato curry were totally uncooked. I could not even cut the potatoes with my spoon. But yesterday we would give another try and after yesterday's experience, we would never go again there. For the price they are charging they should serve much better food. Morever, there are better indian restaurants close by."}
{"text":"Wow - incredible to have Chutney's in our neighborhood - this restaurant brings Indian cuisine to a new level! The flavorful but not too spicy dishes surprise - is this really happening in Tempe, Arizona??? The cooks are from Southern India - but have experience with a variety of regional dishes from all over India. Classic with contemporary creativity - great service, lovely space, very accommodating and heartfelt people, committed to success - try for yourself, in particular the weekend buffets!"}
{"text":"Recently went and felt that restaurant has changed quite a bit from the time it started.  Earlier they were serving papad and chutney as a complimentary snack, now it seems that they have stopped. The rotis were salty (quite disappointed) but the rest of the food was good."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Arizona. I am a foodie and do cook at home, hence understand the intricate spices in Indian Food. Buffets are the way to go. You get a lot of options and try out food both vegetarian and Non Veg. Slightly higher on the price scale but for the taste its acceptable."}
{"text":"Ok, After a long time I did visit Chutneys and here is my observation.  1. This review is only for A-la-carte menu (dinner). - Quality seems to have improved definitely. Not sure about their buffet  2. Anjani is definitely customer centric. All the indian restaurants need to take a leaf out of his book on how to treat customers. He didnt know that I was the guy who left a 1 star review, but in general he was courteous with all the guests including our table.  3. The paneer butter masala was a tad sweet, the other vegetable korma (in a spinach sauce) was rich with cashews mixed in.  4. The 4 star review is mostly for Anajani's customer service and a visible improvement in the quality of service.  If you can hold up to this level of service and up your ante in buffet, you will return to your glory."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in Tempe / Mesa/ Chandler / Scottsdale."}
{"text":"There is a famous saying in US regarding Indian restaurants. When they first open up, they will have the best food quality. But as time rolls by, the food quality starts degrading. That is what we saw at Chutney's. We were there yesterday for dinner. The food was very slow to come even though they hardly had any customers. The wait staff spent most of the time inside the kitchen and not outside looking out for customers who need service. When we asked for the bill, they took 15 minutes to even have it ready. And when it did come, we were overcharged for a few items. When I send it back to be fixed, it did not come for another 15 minutes. I had to finally go and pay for it at the register. I would never ever go back here again."}
{"text":"We went there on Friday evening. The place is very clean and beautiful decorated. Great atmosphere. White tablecloths on the tables.  Great food and from a great friendly and welcoming staff. Was recommended something new based on the manager advice and he did not steer us wrong. Highly recommend. Will be back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"I probably got the worst cook they have make our chili chicken, but it tasted he/ she was trying to create cardboard. I'm Indian, so may be have higher expectations of the dish, but seriously this was crap!"}
{"text":"Garlic cauliflower-wow!  The goat curry was fantastic. Just the right amount of spice. Loved the flavors of naan and the mango ice cream."}
{"text":"We visited Chutney's after a year, last time we visited buffet was not good at all. This time, we went for dinner..  Definitely improved, we ordered Naan, PBM (Panner Butter Masala), Gobi Manchuria. Everything is great.. Specially Naan, very soft and hot from tandoori.. we loved it.. May be we will visit again pretty soon for lunch buffet.."}
{"text":"Just ordered a chicken manchurian from here. Sorry to say but there was NO FLAVOR what so ever!!! Stir frying Huge chunks of chicken in tomato sauce does not cut it! Not to mention the portion size for the money you charge. I absolutely love food and am more than willing to pay for the food and experience but this kind of food is not appreciable. Extremely disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with different sweets. I suggest everyone that don't forget to taste the sambar and Veg curries."}
{"text":"I went with my family for dinner this time and the food was excellent as usual, however i was disappointed with the service and staff over there. We ordered Chicken Tikka kabab (which came on a sizzler) and Chicken manchurian for starters, which were excellent. The best Chicken Manchurian I ever ate at an indian restaurant in US so far. We ordered Naan and vergeterian curries which were good again. The chicken biriyani in the menu says north indian style, however they serve the Hyderabadi DUM chicken biriyani which is again excellent and no complaints about food absolutely. A+ for the food and C- for the Service  However here are some Negatives: 1. The service was still let down as usual. There were plenty of servers this time, but no use. They do not address you frequently to your needs. You need to call them. When you call them, they do not come to you immediately, however give a smile and say they would return only to come back after 5-10 minutes when they could easily listen to our needs. 2. They did not care to see if the water glasses were empty, we had to tell them couple of times to get the water and finally a water jar was placed on the table with no manners to serve the water in the empty glasses which was at least worth our wait. There were hardly few customers that night with several girls to serve who only seem to be busy walking down the aisle to serve one customer and then go back to the kitchen without caring for anybody else on their way back. They do not even look towards anybody else. 3. The main course arrived with only 1 dinner plate when we were 3 of us. The girl said she would be back with plates but never came back and saw her serving food to some other tables. We then had to get hold of somebody else to get our plates since the food was getting cold. 4. The girl who was serving food never came back and asked for any desert or drinks until we called her again. She was in a bit of demand as she was not to be seen for a while.  5. My final comment is the price of Chicken Tikka kabab.. It was 13.95/plate, and we felt it was exorbitant, highest at any indian place in Arizona. The second highest i have seen is at 12.95 at couple of indian restaurants in scottsdale. The Tikka was good but not worth at that price. I had to order it since my son loves it and there was no option for me. The Tandoori Chicken entrees  are highly priced and really should be lowered in my opinion. The tandoori chicken for instance was 12.95 which is again exorbitant, since it is around 10-11 everywhere else.   I hope the owners(with their highly inexperienced staff)  and other customers will find this review useful for the dinner and service."}
{"text":"You walk in and it looks really clean, decent,  and somewhat upscale. It's like an mildy upscale indian cuisine restaurant.  Pretty legit.    The food here is really good.  I like it a lot - the lamb curry, chicken tikka massala, and other foods you would expect to be there are outstanding!   However....it just took EXTREMELY long for the food to come out and there was some type of miscommunication between the server and the kitchen because 3 out of the 5 orders at our table were wrong and it's been around 45 min to an hour wait time. Since we were hungry, we took the food anyway - but it WAS good!  So all in all - not bad food wise.    For some reason or another - the service we got that day was extremely slow and flustered (which may come off as a first world problem). Despite that, I would still give this place another try because I truly enjoyed the food when we finally got it.   With an attitude of gratitude I see the bright side that I actually got to eat that day as opposed to many that are struggling in the world - I can't bad mouth the place.  I was fed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and awesome choices of desserts. Great options for Vegetarians. But on the pricier side!"}
{"text":"Good varieties of Indian food during lunch buffet.they have to serve it fast during dinner time."}
{"text":"They must have change management, they are so much better than before. Lot of varieties, tastes really good, good service and nice place. This is my new favorite Indian restaurant in Valley. Price is a little on the higher end, but worth it."}
{"text":"Stayed away from this location for a while after less than awesome experiences at Pasand.  However, I was happy to find the the re-vamped Chutneys is a huge improvement.  The staff is friendlier, and menu is good, and the decor is really nice.    We sampled appetizers and enjoyed the variety, also liked the dinner options- portions were fair and the food was flavorful.  I was also very happy to find carrot halwa on the menu for dessert, as most local Indian restaurants for some reason do not offer it."}
{"text":"Awesome Tikka Marsala and the Vindaloo is to die for!  The wait staff are friendly and prompt, and the food is amazing. I don't claim to be an expert on Indian cuisine, but we do enjoy Chutney's, and when we are hungry for good Indian food, we always head here."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I had in Tempe. Buffet was good. Worth the money spent. Had Manchurian Idali- South-Indian food cooked in a different way. Must try for all the food lovers!!  As it is always full on weekends, the food is freshly cooked & served. Big Thumps Up from My side.  And don't miss the buffet.   Cheers, ~Ed"}
{"text":"Food is average. Service is good.  Ambiance is excellent....  Its really open and spacious..."}
{"text":"Great place to have some yummy Indian food. We got the chance to go twice. The place is beautiful, food is yummy and the staff are great! We went from NYC. Have not seen such nice Indian restaurant in New York. Love to go back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and each time has been a pleasant experience. The location is super clean. The buffett has many vegetarian and vegan options. Everything is fresh and new dishes are rotated in often. The manager (maybe owner) today was very hospitable and explained ingredients of the various recipes with enthusiasm. Best Gulab Jamun by far - made onsight. We will be back many times. The best Indian restaurant we have found in AZ."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in the valley.... they have awesome buffet for lunch I have visited this place on Saturday must say on a very reasonable price they had goat meat ,chicken ,fish ..... and after long time got chance to have some chat. Service was good decent ambience . Perfect place to try the best authentic Indian food...."}
{"text":"Ordered a takeout of Malai Kofta and Navaratan Korma - medium spicy. The underlying sauce for both dishes was pretty much the same. The dishes were incredibly spicy with ground black pepper in it overshadowing all other flavors. The navaratan korma is supposed to consist of mixed vegetables but I pretty much found only potatoes.   Was just surprised by the quality of the food, have had better experiences in the past at the same place.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"horrible service and treatment to the customers, i tried to call and ask a question got a grumpy old man that was very rude and wasn't clear in answering me. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We were visiting a Family in AZ, went to this restaurant, we ordered food and we really liked starter so we reordered and waiter messed up the order and waiter did not even bother to apologize and did not even ask to replace it. That was really rude. No complimentary onion or papadam. Just saying if you run this big restaurant and a business, at least should have decent customer service. Bad attitude. Food was very good except tandoori roti, that was like a chips."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Delicious. Great menu! Superb service. I've been here four times this month already."}
{"text":"WoW, where do I start... We went here for the Sunday buffet and then went back for dinner the following Friday.  The buffet was pretty good, a little spicy, but that wasn't a bad thing at all. They had a live dosa station but they only offered plain dosa's which was a little disappointing. The buffet had a 70/30 mix of South Indian and North Indian dishes and and also a bhel station.   The dinner was average. I ordered the malai kofta, Punjabi paneer and garlic naan. My friends ordered a chili onion uttapam, chicken tikka masala, lamb saag, and a masala dosa. All were pretty bland as in lack of Indian spices/seasonings.  The food was average so I give it 3 stars, decor was modern and restaurant overall was very clean so that would bump the rating up to 3.5 stars...  So here is why they get only one star... Their waiters and staff have no concept of how to split a ticket! First at the lunch buffet we were a party of 6. We all got the buffet and I had a beer with my meal. We needed the tickets split as such, 2:2:1:1. First they just dropped the check off, didn't tell or ask anyone if it was all separate or together, and it had everyone's tab on the same check. So then we asked for it to be split as mentioned above it took them three tries and 40 minutes and it still wasn't right. We finally got so frustrated that we worked something out ourselves and left. I mean, cmon, how hard is it to split up a check with only buffet charges on it???!!!  Theeeeeeen, when we returned for dinner and after the lunch check debacle, we told our waiter to split the checks up front because of what had happened last time. He said he would take our orders on one check and then split them at the time of the bill. We were a party of 8 this time and we looked at each other and reluctantly agreed. That turned out to be the ultimate mistake! Our actual ordering and eating time? 1 hour. Time spent on these knuckle heads trying to split our check, no joke... 1 hour! A whole friggin hour!!!   Things that happened within this hour: check once again was not split initially, waiter had the audacity to ask me to initial each persons order and then he would create the separate tickets (so I am now doing his job) still was not correct. Manager \"takes charge\" and tabulates new checks, still not correct. Sister gets pissed, actually takes charge, writes each out individual check, see included pic. Manager feels bad, gives us all a free dessert, doesn't give my sister a spoon for it lol! We finally get our checks and depart grumbling and ready to eat again since it took so long just to get our checks.   Moral of the story: if you eat here, and want your check split, DON'T DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the food was great just once. Rest of the times it was just average. Lunch Buffet on a Weekday wasn't really great."}
{"text":"They used serve really good food, but nowadays food is very bad. Recently went there for Dinner and had a horrible food."}
{"text":"There are couple of items I liked but besides that I feel the dishes are either lacking in taste, quality or smelly. Think few dishes are 4days old judging from smell."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to come to whether for a work break lunch or a weekend meal. The food has never disappointed in my many visits. The restaurant is clean and let the hosts are very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, the chicken tikka masala was sweet, the chicken was plastic, and the cheese nun had NO CHEEZE!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the worst Indian food I ever had.. Got the wrong bill . Never again coming to this place .."}
{"text":"The Indian food here is always new, fresh, and exquisite. I really like the variety here every time I go. Today they had like 6 different deserts to choose from. This place is great."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat in the Valley. Always great tasting food and fast service. The owner is amazing and will explain dishes to you and the buffet is one of a kind! If you never have had the opportunity to experience Indian Cuisine, I would highly recommend coming for the lunch buffet to experience all sorts of dishes!"}
{"text":"Just had their lunch buffet.  I took a bit of almost everything and thought the food was quite good.  They seemed to have quite a variety of meat and vegatable dishes  washed down with a nice Kingfisher beer.  I admit that I'm not an expert in Indian food, and only know what I like.  However, I have spent time in India and other parts of Asia where I have had quite a few Indian meals and this appears to be very similar and therefore I'm guessing fairly authentic.  The second clue is that there were a lot of Indian familes there.  It has a nice family feel about the place, draws larger groups of people, so all in all a pleasant experience.  The service was ok, not spectacular, but for a buffet you don't need much service."}
{"text":"Not good for Vegetarians!  I went for the \"special\" labor day buffet. This restaurant is the priciest Indian buffet in the valley as far as I know but they always raise the prices for occasions like labor day, Independence day, some Kerala festival etc.   At over $14 per person (including taxes), I expected better service and better food. I asked for a high chair for my son and the waiter acknowledged but when he didn't bring it, my wife politely reminded him. He still didn't bring it and I saw that they were having a busy day so I tried to bring it myself but couldn't find it. So I asked a different waitress for assistance. She took me to the original waiter and asked him to give me a high chair and somehow that seems to have upset him. He pretended that I was invisible and brusquely took the high chair and placed it at our table while I followed him. He hadn't looked at me then and made sure to avoid our table since! I was polite throughout so I couldn't see why he had to do that!  Also, the water we were served had some floating particles and when I pointed it out the waiter (or perhaps manager) took them away and sent one clean glass and another glass with floating particles!  The variety of food for vegetarians wasn't commensurate with the price. In particular, the only rice offered was \"mint rice\". It would have been nice to offer a vegetarian biryani since most of the appetizers were meat anyway. There was a notice at the buffet counter that Dosa and Naan would be served at the table but not once were we offered Dosa or Naan. We could help ourselves to naan though. And if I had waited for the Dosas to be replaced, I am sure I could have helped myself to Dosa too but why the notice of table service when they don't even ask once!   There was a decent variety of desserts but I can't say the same about the quality. The gulab jamuns were anything about round and were somewhat lumpy (undercooked perhaps?), the ice cream looked unappetizing although I hadn't tried it. Custard with fruits was okay."}
{"text":"We just left very satisfied again! The food is so good and the service is excellent. The owner has greeted us and took the time to guide us in the right direction every time we've gone. He even brought us a few things from the buffet that we might not have tried and we're glad he did as they were delicious. My mother enjoyed it very much as well. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went with Indian food group for lunch. Pleasantly surprised with the presentation, variety and quality of food within buffet.  Nicely decorated restaurant with attentive staff Only one negative comment:  desserts not at par with remainder of buffet"}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, we ordered palak dal and chana masala which is served with rice. Both curries were really good, chana dal was slightly on the sweeter side, you will probably have to go with the spicy version if you don't like that, we had ordered chana masala with medium spice. We also tried the burning bullet naan, went well with the chana masala. The bullet naan is extremely spicy, worth a try though. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped into this restaurant while on vacation and boy did it completely exceed my expectations! Great quality and flavor and the staff was extremely attentive. Will definitely be coming back!! Agree was awesome!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place.  First, the food was delicious.  Starters was some of the best pakora I have ever had. We had a chicken biriani and lamb vindaloo as main courses.  Both were delicious, I loved the cashew sauce that came with the biriani, and would recommend the vindaloo to everyone.  To complete, we tried an Indian style ice cream that is made in house.  It was the best!  Denser and more intensely flavored than American ice cream.  We had the pistachio and mango-- make sure you try the mango!"}
{"text":"I had not previously been exposed to Indian Cuisine- but I had a wonderful experience at Chutneys !!! The staff was outstanding and I enjoyed the buffet   They had a wide array of Indian food and educated my son and I about each dish.  I would definitely highly recommended and we will be going back soon. Thank you Chutneys !! Scott W."}
{"text":"For those of you who can't figure out why this location is familiar, this used to be Pasand's Indian Food. I had walked in and walked out because it did not look great on the inside- NOW- this place is Chutney's, new owner, amazing interior! They gutted the place and completely redesigned this restaurant. All new everything! My silverware was sparkling, love it!   -The staff was very attentive; promptly greeted and seated, we were able to get assistance from our waiter with what to order and his suggestions, our glasses never emptied, food came promptly and piping hot, and empty dishes were immediately taken away.   -At the end of our meal- the new owner stopped by our table to see how everything was. He was extremely nice and you could tell how much pride he takes in his restaurant; you can tell by the way it looks and is run.  -To top everything off- there is even a generous feedback area at the bottom of every receipt. My friend and I had left our comments about how great the service was and delicious the food is. We did ask that if possible, we would like to see them add mango chutney to the menu (it's one of our favorite Indian sides and is a personal staple with naan in my opinion). :-)  -To start off your meal you will get some crispy Indian bread (can't remember the name), and you get their homemade dipping sauces. Everything seemed to pack a punch and was delicious. There was a sweet & sour sauce, a savory mint sauce, a tomato based sauce, and a coconut sauce. They were all very good and went great with the house made naan ($2.00) we ordered which was OMG delicious! Fluffy and perfect!   -We ordered two different chicken dishes, one was Chicken Tikki Masala and the other came as a recommendation from our waiter, both were very good. Their heat scale is 1-10. We tried one at a 3 and one at a 4 and they were both very hot! The four was extremely spicy for us- not so much that we couldn't enjoy it, we both just prefer a more mild heat. Both dishes were very smooth and tasty, you could tell the quality of chicken was high too (plus it was all white meat).  We will absolutely go back. We have been waiting for a clean, delicious Indian restaurant- even though the entire set up isn't complete, you should head in and give it a shot, I don't think it will disappoint. I look forward to trying the lunch buffet. :-)"}
{"text":"We were really pleased with our dinner. We went with the vegetable korma and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. All of it was good. The service excellent - staff are friendly, attentive."}
{"text":"Lamb biryani was the bomb. Garlic cauliflower and chicken lollypop were my favorite appetizers. We came here for dinner for the first time since its been renovated. Menu looks new and has a wide variety of Indian dishes (loved it!!). Every dish seemed well prepared and nicely presented. They had just the right amount of spice and were flavorful. We even got some packed to eat at home for later. We will definitely be back here soon to try out some more things."}
{"text":"Food is good except it's a little pricey. Restaurant is clean and neat and the ambiance is super cool"}
{"text":"First time here. I chose this place due to all the great reviews on Yelp. I'm a fan of indian buffets.   1. This is by far the cleanest and most modern looking indian buffet I have ever been to.  That is a BIG plus for me. 2. Lots of variety in their lunch buffet, typically twice the size of what you usually see. 3. Flavors were good.  Very spicy however.  This is not mild food so be aware. 4. Would I be back? If I am in the area, sure.  It wasn't the best I have had. Personally, I really like India's Oven in Gilbert as far as flavor.  But this place beats any other indian buffet on variety and cleanliness.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Indian food. Everything I have tried is absolutely fresh, flavorful and mouth watering. If something isn't on the menu, they will make it for you. The restaurant is super clean, the staff is super friendly and attentive and you are treated like family. Everything about this place is great!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the buffet there. It's our favorite place for buffet. The variety and quality of food is very good."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of buffets .And when it comes to Indian ,I become more specific choosing a place. However this place has been bookmarked in my list a while ago and finally we walked in on a Sunday afternoon. We are 3 in count and stepping into ,someone walked to us to our table. Staff are prompt in cleaning and attending .   Coming to the food, YES!! they have a wide spread on buffet(For me I felt they have huge variety of desserts) one can find in the valley. Also to mention , the food was fresh and nice in taste for a buffet quality. They can deserve a star extra for cleanliness and the interiors.   If I can suggest, I would mention to add some mango lassi  as summer is about to start on the counter. The day we went we found only masala chai ."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets.  It is the best Indian Cuisine I have had since my last visit to India.  The place is clean and the owners and staff are friendly.  Our server, Sri, was attentive, friendly and wore a radiant smile all evening.  We had a couple of appetizers - the garlic cauliflower and garlic shrimp - both were perfect.  For entrees, we had Hariyali (Mint and Cilantro) Murg Kebab and the Goan fish curry - they reminded me of being back in New Deli and Goa. We were also treated to live entertainment by Anna, a classically trained pianist who added to the ambiance.  It was her first night there and we hope it will not be her last."}
{"text":"First I must note that I've only had food delivered so I suspect that the food in the restaurant would taste worlds better fresh out of the kitchen.  However the butter chicken I ordered tasted like chunks of chicken in a lightly seasoned tomato soup.  It was good, but extremely bland.  Rice was cooked perfectly, and the naan seems to be hit or miss.  First time I ordered it was perfect, second time it was like heated matzah.  I feel its important to note I've ONLY ever ordered butter chicken with plain naan.  It's possible that butter chicken just isn't one of their good recipes.  However based on that I'd say that if you want to introduce someone to Indian cuisine this is a nice place with with an American-friendly palate.    If you're trying to find more of a \"home cooked\" style flavor, you may want to keep looking."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants ever. The owner is so personable and always stops by every table to chat with the diners which I find extremely sweet! You can tell he puts his all in and the food is really telling of that. Tonight we ordered delivery and it was just as good as dining in! I wish I could give more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Overall a decent place great service good atmosphere and tasty, but it seems overpriced for dinner (I have not had their lunch buffet). I would come back but it isn't near the top of my list.   they do live up to their name though, the chutneys were quite nice."}
{"text":"Updating my review which I had written months back . This place has great food , I had combo gobi munchurian & fried rice . It was delicious , indo Chinese at this place is much better than newly opened indo Chinese restaurant in scottsdale . Service is good too . I had a chat with the other owner and he was telling me they are going to add more dishes to menu . I am looking forward to try those ."}
{"text":"Vegan dishes galore! The staff gave us an extremely detailed explanation of everything on the menu. Which we appreciate since we lack knowledge regarding Indian cuisine. I don't know how to rate the food based on authenticity, but as a vegan food critic I loved it! Great staff, clean environment, good food, modern decor, huge space for larger groups, and a long list of menu items. This place is close to my home so we will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. Their hours are wrong, they aren't open on Monday's right now.  Edit: They are now open 7 days a week. Increased the rating to 5, I love the food but I was very unhappy to drive there when they were closed. Hoping it doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Another great find in Arizona. The service is amazing. It's OK really well run family restaurant. The food is terrific and very authentic. Delicious. Highly recommend it and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered food at 1:55, was told it would be delivered within 35-60 minutes. It's now been 2 hours and I still have no food. Even if the food is amazing I'll never order or go to again. Yet if I don't tip I'm a jerk"}
{"text":"Right when you walk into this restaurant, the first thing you will notice is the quality and cleanliness. I think they have the right mix of fanciness and comfort, which is a hard ratio to get right. There are booth style seats to enjoy your meal with a little more privacy around the perimeter of the restaurant; as well as open area seating with quaint dark wooden square tables. Either are very comfortable and go well with the decor. The lighting is a delicately dimmed down and wraps the restaurant into a relaxed, laid back aura; giving you a sense of suddenly arriving in a new unique environment.   There is an aromatic lunch buffet I helplessly fell into, and I was very pleased with the diversity of options-both for the staunch vegan and proud carnivore. The tandoori chicken was tender and pretty bright orange-reddish color. The rice was as exquisitely all-dente as Joe Pesci's grits in \"My Cousin Vinny\". Yep. That good. The place doesn't mind you going back for more either, which bodes well for the hungriest of us.  I'll end by touching on what is probably the most important thing next to food: SERVICE. Are you used  to enduring the trifling Circuit City-esque style customer service of those unfortunate poorly trained and brusque Foodservice laborers oozing apathy while ruining your experience as they bowl over you on their high speed highway to increase the proprietor's turnover percentage? It's something we have all unfortunately experienced-similar to that of terribly long winded run-on sentences. However, there is good news! You WILL NOT get that cold dish here. Service is a dish best served warm, and this place throws it over to you like Tom Brady in the pocket. For example, I was enjoying the spiciness of their food and happened to cough a little bit. Without even asking, one of the employees (Bob) waived someone down for me-almost as if it was an emergency-and had them bring me over a fresh glass of water right away. WOW right? It's nice to be treated like people care that you are there. Oh if it were always so nice....SIGH  Go eat here. NOW"}
{"text":"I've finally found an Indian restaurant that I can repeatedly go to! I haven't had Indian food since moving here as I was told there were no good places to go. The buffet at lunch was very good!"}
{"text":"Yes... finally a good South and North Indian lunch buffet.  South Indian menu was more tasteful than the North .  Overall this is the best Indian buffet in AZ.....    *** only issue is that the exterior does not match the interior ... flowers will help****"}
{"text":"First time here. Very unsatisfactory. I've eaten a LOT of Indian food over the years at many different places, but the food here is subpar. The flavors are just bleh and the consistency of some of the dishes is really poor. For an example I LOVE a good palak paneer, so I was excited to try that here, but the paneer was really spongy and weird like it wasn't cooked right, and the flavor of the palak was just bad. I couldn't even eat it. Very sad to say this place is 1 star."}
{"text":"During  a work conference I suggested Chutney's as a lunch option.  My coworkers of Indian subcontinent extraction agreed heartily with my choice.  Chutney's lunch buffet delivered with a wonderful dining experience.  Good food, plenty of table room for  a large group and good service.  After dining my suggestion garnered me props from my peers notably from those who grew up in India.  They were very pleased with the flavor and variety.  I will take that as an endorsement for the flavor and quality of the experience at Chutney's."}
{"text":"Very clean and delicious food!! Very helpful service. I felt the price of the meal was comparable to value. I would definately return.."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Outstanding service. Definitely going to return again very soon. Best Indian food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place especially the biryani, every time am in town. I stop by. It's clean, although they do take a while to prepare, so call ahead or be patient, will be worth it. Good luck"}
{"text":"We stay in Tempe and I really like the food here.the dishes are authentic and tasteful.All the vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes are great.special kudos to the manager and guys over there who are very courteous and respectful"}
{"text":"Great place, fantastic food , excellant service . I am here for the third time and really nice. Unbeatable prices.  Try the chicken pepper masala and Kashmiri chicken .. you will love it"}
{"text":"I like the lunch buffet here most because of variety and taste.i personally like chicken biriyani, kabab, mutton curry, golab jamun..and the ambiance is also good peaceful. ."}
{"text":"I feel like the wife and I just filmed the \"When Harry Met Sally\" sequel. We had the Chili Chicken to start. I didn't specify a spice level and it was really nice for me.  For my wife, it was very hot. The server noticed my wife and brought over some yogurt to cool it down.  Worked great!  We ordered the kashmir naan.  Then my wife released her inner Sally. It was very embarrassing, but this is some amazing naan!  We had the lamb korma and the murg masala. Excellent as well. Also, service was great."}
{"text":"I went today for the Sunday buffet. From the moment we entered, we were greeted by smiling faces and excellent service. The food was amazing and I plan on returning time and again. I highly recommend trying this restaurant out...and SOON! EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch yesterday and was impressed.  It's not much from the outside but when you walk in it's very nice, clean, and good atmosphere inside.  For lunch they have a full buffet with a large selection.  I'm not an expert on Indian food, so I tried a little of everything and I loved it all.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"They had the Best Biryani in AZ. I have Chicken Biryani in several places in phoenix and tempe, but this place beats everything.  Had gone sometimes for their buffet and it was good too. I have to give 5 stars for the ambience of this place too."}
{"text":"very good place for south Indian spicy food. We went for  dinner and not for buffet.  Chittinad dosa, Chicken Biryani,  chilli baby-corn, Chicken Chittinad, garlic naans are good."}
{"text":"Good food but the service was a let down!  good: ambience food decor  not-so-good: service  I was really disappointed with the service. The staff was unresponsive and super slow. Our table wasn't clean and we wanted to move to a booth, but they didn't let us. We had to wait endlessly to place our order, for the food to arrive and for the staff to get our check.  And yes, the curries are served with a side of rice, they forgot the rice part too. I would be okay with all this if the place was overcrowded and there were too many orders, but in our case, the place was almost empty, there were 3 to 4 other groups but they were done eating and ready to leave.   The food was good. I specially liked the chicken tikka masala.  Malai kofta was good too. Their spice levels are from 1 - 10. Anything beyond 5 would be really spicy ( I can handle medium to spicy food, but not super spicy)"}
{"text":"1 Star? Yes, that's what they earned. Here are some highlights:  * I had to sit there waiting for someone to refill my water while only 3 tables were occupied (On a Saturday night, go figure) and there were at least 5-6 staff members. Not sure what they were doing!!   * The food was ok, just ok with the portions way too small for what they charge for them.   * Don't bother trying the Malai Kofta.   * The paneer dish should come with fishing poles or scuba gear to fish out the paneer from it.  * The naan was thin, and dry.  * The meat-daal was ok.  * Finally, I had to wait a long time for the check to arrive and then it seems they forgot to run the card. After a reminder they apologized and quickly processed it. We were not there for speed date but didn't want to hang around looking at our dirty dishes after we were done with our meal.  To their credit, their presentation with the pots on the stands with the tea lights is nice. Though the pots were delivered first and then someone came running with the stands and tea lights. That was almost funny. Well, almost.  Not sure if I am going back and I don't recommend that you go there either."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had. Our table of 7 was the only one occupied except for one other couple. It took 50 minutes to get our foo during which time we were ignored. We received water while we waited endlessly. When we complained to the waiter, he said they had a new chef. There was no apology or discount on our bill. They ruined our family birthday celebration. Never again!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Service is awesome. Lunch buffet and the sweets are good"}
{"text":"What can I say... It's bad.  All the curry tasted watered down, poorly seasoned; chicken was dry, overcooked.  Wasn't a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"First experience with Indian food and omgosh what an impression! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We really like this Indian restaurant.  The butter chicken is delicious and so is the dosa. I haven't tried the buffet but only because it is a long way for us to drive. We enjoy eating here before the theater."}
{"text":"We went to Sunday Buffet. Service was good. Food was ok. Chicken 65 wasnt up there in taste. Definitely felt a shortage in non-veg menu. Main dishes were missing such as Chicken Karrhai, Beef Nehari, and Paya. Chutney's and raita was never refilled after they were out. Typical Desi Restaurant of Arizona."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix, I am few times visiting AZ and whenever I have been to this place, the experience is fantastic. I love their chef table concept and also have good selection of bar drinks and cocktails. Try their south Indian dishes like goat vindaloo and Chettinad, it is great. Very authentic"}
{"text":"The food was one of the best i have had in and around Tempe. Especially, Cauliflower Manchurian was delicious. They have a wide range of options to choose from. However I wasn't happy with the long waiting time between dishes. If they can reduce the waiting time,probably this is one of the perfect places to have a wonderful dinner !"}
{"text":"Went tonight for the second time in two months. The food is really good but their service is very slow. Be prepared to spend at least an hour waiting to get your food."}
{"text":"Almost the best Indian Cuisine Restaurant in Tempe. The food was simply superb. We enjoyed each and every bite. There were certain dishes that we couldnt find elsewhere, for example the kerala dish \"Avial\". The chutney was the best, no wonder the name.   Everything we ordered was hot and tasty. Didn't realize the waiting time because of the \"Papad\" and 3 different  chutneys that was served initially.   The menu has no many varieties and the best part is, they cover all the cuisines of India from the north all the way to the south.  The two owners were really nice and sweet to talk to us and gave personal attention. Great hospitality by the staff and very nice Classical music in the background.   All in all, a restaurant I would recommend to anyone looking for best Indian cuisine. All credits to the chef!"}
{"text":"I love its Sunday buffet. It's not a skimpy buffet, and not on the cheap end (~$13/person for Sunday lunch). It has great food and tons of flavor. Meat lovers would get their money's worth there. The variety of fruits and desserts can easily satisfy anyone's sweet tooth (fair warning, Indian desserts are really really sugary). It's a great place to get a little \"kick\" in your taste buds.  During my last visit, I spotted Mango ice cream and Mango juice, which made me tremendously happy. That being said, I think the quality has gone down a bit. Namely the chicken/lamb curry dishes have more bones mixed in and less meat on the bone.  I am not a connoisseur of authentic Indian food. But the presence of lots of Indian families there offers a sign of assurance. I like this place and hope it can maintain its quality."}
{"text":"this was recommended by my friends - their buffet did meet the expectation - had a good number of varieties. well maintained restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best Indian food I've ever had and you can instantly tell who the owner is. He is always asking how everything tastes and does a good job of explaining the menu for our first time. You can tell he is so passionate about service and the food. Prices are very reasonable and more than worth the money. I would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to Chutneys for my husband's birthday and it was excellent! We had a table of 12 and everyone was very happy with their food, lamb, chicken, appetizers - everything came out delicious. The service was great as well. We didn't tell them it was a special occasion but they picked up on it and brought out a plate of ice cream for everyone on the house which I thought was a great touch. Especially, since I've been to places where we told them it was a special occasion and they did nothing extra. So it that little extra attention was appreciated.   This place used to be Pasand awhile back and I gotta say it has improved a lot. The decor, the food, the service - everything is much better now. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"one of the better Indian restaurant in Tempe. Price is reasonable. Has good chicken biryani vijaywada. Good customer service. All in all worth time and money."}
{"text":"We have been here several times now and Love Love Love it! The Tika Masla is so good! and the Naan bread is super light and tasty.They have lots of different kinds too, we like garlic and  cashmerie. They have great iced tea too!   The service is always great! and the owners are always making sure we are taken care of, they remember us every time we come back.. It feels like home and everyone is super friendly! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent buffet and ambience.. Liked it d most in phoenix ... Must go for indian food !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet today. I really liked the variety of both north and south indian food that they had. The food tasted delicious. My only critique would be that the staff should constantly monitor the food being served during the buffet to make sure that it does not get cold or too dry. This specially applies to the dosas, sambhar and chicken pieces. If the food is cold or dry, it does not matter how tasty it is -  I wouldn't like to come back to get more!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Fri night.  Service was lacking and so was the food. Our waiter - nice kid, but didn't know the first thing about the food.  We were actually amazed that the owner wouldn't take more care in teaching the staff.  The manager was there nonchalantly walking around but never offered any help or even stop by to see how things were. We ordered palak paneer, lamb keema, chicken tikka masala and egg curry.  The palak paneer was probably the best dish.  The keema's spices were overpowering and was hard to eat.  The tikka masala was ok, but seemed to be missing something.  Overall, the food was just ok and won't warrant a return trip."}
{"text":"Good food.   Awesome service, special thanks to Anand for amazing service and fun.   All the best dude !!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped in to Chutney's for the first time in a very long time. It's a little out of the way for me, and I like a few places closer to my house enough to not bother with the trip. However, after my last visit, that's definitely going to change!  I did their lunch buffet, and I was pleasantly surprised at how big it was. The had all the staples, a few types of Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhini, Tandoori Chicken, Korma, Briyani, etc., etc. Basically, all the types of things that scream 'mainstream' Indian food (Not that I'm any sort of expert though, haha.) and all in one buffet too, which was awesome. Normally you get one of two things off that list, and maybe seven or eight other options. However, that was definitely not the case here. I think this is one of the biggest Indian Buffets I've been too. So, even though it's a little more expensive than others in the valley, I think the variety is worth it, especially if you're bringing friends who are trying Indian food for the first time.  In addition to all the basics, they also had a wide selection of things I hadn't tried before, and they were all equally delicious. Their sides, and desserts were also quite good. Even little things like having a wide variety of fresh fruits tells me they don't cut corners, which is definitely something to appreciate. Also, the spice level was perfect for a buffet, everything had a kick, but a very 'approachable' kick. Things could have been spicier, but they were super tasty even where they were at. Some buffets go way too much in either direction, but Chutney's is definitely a happy medium.  Atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice. Everything is very clean, and feels new, even though I know they've been here awhile now. Service is also good. The owner is friendly, and you get a container of water to keep at your table, which is nice when you're eating spicy food.   All in all, completely superior experience. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best. It's pretty Indian meaning it hasn't been Americanized. They serve more than just chicken tiki masala. The owner is usually there and the service is great. He makes sure that the quality of the food is 5 stars and how it should be. If you aren't sure what to get he will give you some great suggestions. The butter chicken is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Take-out orders always have errors, but take-out is the only way to order off the menu here. Picking up a take-out order is interesting. The last time I ordered through GrubHub my order wasn't ready yet, so they directed me to sit at a table, then kicked me out of the table, then directed me to the bar, then kicked me out of the bar. Finally I was like, \"I'm just going to go sit over by the door and you can bring it to me when it's ready.\" 20 minutes later (seriously??) they asked me to come back to the bar, so I walked back through the entire restaurant AGAIN only to be handed the bag. Poor customer service. Pick-up customers really shouldn't be traipsing through the restaurant half a dozen times. They need a better system.   Their menu is FANTASTIC and I really like their food (except their samosas, which were SUPER salty the last several times I ordered them), but they push their buffet so hard it's nearly impossible to find a time when they'll let you order off the menu. Their buffet has a limited selection of vegetarian items, and the last time I ate off the buffet, I ended up eating mostly bread and fried cauliflower. They are also very slow in restocking, so if the one thing I can eat runs out, it's a looooong time before more arrives.  The first time I ran into the \"Oh, no, order the buffet\" pushback from the manager, I told him I was a vegetarian and wanted to order veggie pakoras and samosas off the menu. He refused, and assured me there were several pakora and samosa choices on the buffet. There weren't. None of my favorites are ever available on the buffet, and since I'm apparently not allowed to order off the menu anymore, there's simply no point in ever going back. If they want to be a buffet restaurant, they really should just ditch their menu instead of teasing us with it."}
{"text":"Want to try something a little bit different? When I do, I head over to Chutney's for some savory and spicy indian and indoasian cuisine.  There are dishes here that are famliar favorites along with some dishes that have a more heavy indoasian take, that may not be available readily in the valley.   There is a HUGE parking lot with bike parking as this restaurant is located in a strip mall.  The inside is rather large and includes a banquet hall for holiday parties and other occasion where one may rent the space out and have an event catered.    The service was a little sparce in the begining, however I did come at the busy lunch hour.  There wasn't anyone to greet me when I came in, however within a few mins someone came out of the kitchen to check on the front of house and he welcomed me and showed me my seat. Lunch time offers a buffet with some appetizers (various fritters depending on the day and dosa) sambar, sauces and salad. They have several types of rice including and interesting fried rice that looks what you may get with chinese takeout, however the spice profile is more complex and similar to what you would get in a biryani. The offer several main dishes with familair faves like butter chicken & paneer masala and some indoasian treats like mushroom or baby corn maruchan. You really need to try this for your self, but for me its like two of my favorite types of food had a beautiful baby! I love the savory taste of the chinese inspired ingredients along with the myriad spices used in traditional indian cuisine.   There is also Chai tea and dessert avialable. None have ever stood out at this location yet, but its nice that they have them at the end of the meal.   Come by during thier lunch buffet and give it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Arizona from Southern CA and have been been trying out new Indian restaurants religiously in an attempt to find one that matches the quality of food and service that we are used to from back home. This place knocked it out of the park!   Let me start by saying I read a lot of the other reviews people wrote about this place, and it seems like most of the \"issues\" are service-related. We went for lunch when they have the buffet open, so there was not a whole lot of service required, however the service that we did receive was fantastic. We are not hard to please, but I was extremely happy when the server brought over a pitcher of water and placed it on the table for us. I know for some that might seem like a negative, however, for me I prefer it that way. Indian food can be spicy, and my husband and I both drink a lot of water, so rather than have to moderate how much food we eat based on how low our water glasses are, or wait for the server to come and refill our glasses every 5 minutes, having the pitcher on the table was a huge positive to our experience.   The food itself was delicious and they had a really good variety of food- plenty of familiar items alongside items that were foreign to me that I got to try. Also, even though they didn't put them out on the buffet, the hostess informed us that the dosas are included in the buffet price which was a great addition to our experience!   Overall the experience was great and we will definitely be going back, likely once a week. For $11 each, it's a great deal and definitely worth trying if you haven't been. My only suggestion would be to go early- we went at about 11:45 and they had pretty much just opened, but by the time we were finishing up (about 12:15ish) the place was PACKED. There was a HUGE line at the buffet, so definitely go early or late, but I'd say avoid the standard 12-12:30 lunch time."}
{"text":"Chutneys is easily the best Indian buffet in the valley. I've been there twice now and I've always been impressed. They rotate through different dishes to keep it fresh for regulars while keeping the classics (the butter chicken is amazing!). The dishes vary in spice; so if you can't handle heat, there's still something for you. There are also dishes from all over India if you're looking to try something new!  Desserts include kulfi - which is something I've never seen any other Indian buffet do in the entire valley.  Lunch buffet runs weekends too, so definitely not something to miss!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent friendly service.... we will be returning.. but with out the kids to enjoy the full experience"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome! The food was delicious and the service was nice and friendly. The only thing that could make this better is if they delivered. *Hint Hint*"}
{"text":"This place is good. I love the ambience and the food. Burning Bullet Naan is good though. It spikes your senses."}
{"text":"It's strictly average. I went along with 6 friends based on a friends recommendation. Let me start with the server who forces you to try a drink you don't want to. He gave us a 5 minute monologue on how good this new drink is. It might be the best drink in the world, but the way they try to sell it you is beyond me. I'd rather have the drink do all the talking than the server.   We ordered Cheese Masala Dosa's which were good. They weren't heavy enough so we ended up ordering Daal, Malai Paneer & some Naan. We all know Malai Paneer is inherently sweet, so we made sure we ask them if they make it differently(spicy) before ordering. The guy gave us a puzzled look saying that it's not at all sweet and will be very spicy. Alas, it was sweet! To be fair them, the cook was kind enough to make it again with extra spices. It was better but again a little sweet. Daal was good and so was the Basil Naan(highly recommended).   I wouldn't be going back anytime soon. I've tried there lunch buffet as well and wasn't impressed. Oh and I hope they improve their mediocre service & reduce their prices. It took them 15 minutes to take our order."}
{"text":"We had lunch buffet on Friday. Everything was good and hot . Gulab jamun was the highlight .  I felt the North Indian dishes tastes much better than the South Indian dishes in the buffet ."}
{"text":"I have been here several times already, and I decided to update my review on 05/20/2018. I usually have their gongura goat curry and the kadai paneer, and both are pretty amazing dishes. I have also tried the weekend buffet many times, and most items are extremely delicious and very authentic. They even have a buffet of desserts from different parts of the country, which is very cool. The owner is a great guy as well, and he explains the menu options with great patience. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try great authentic Indian food at a very reasonable price. 5 stars from me! :-)"}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in the valley. Very large and diverse assortment. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Indian food (being Indian, I may be slightly biased). I was here a while ago and went in for their weekend lunch buffet. The ambiance was decent and the place was clean.  The naan was fresh and delicious and I LOVED their saag paneer (if I remember correctly).  That was my favorite part of the meal. I had a bit of the tandoori chicken, also tasty. The only let down was the gajar ka halwa, it was more like carrot that had been stewed in milk, it was not halwa. The gulab jamuns were good though so I loaded up on those. The wait staff were fairly attentive and courteous. I really look forward to trying their South Indian food particularly their Malabar fish curry and rice. They do offer appams as well (which I really really want to try). Overall, good food, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've dined here at least three times.  Twice for dinner and once for the lunch buffet.  Every meal has been good.  I enjoy Indian food (and the buffets) and have sampled many restaurants around.  This is definitely one of the better restaurants in Tempe, if not the entire East Valley.  I've been searching for a good buffet nearby and so far this is the best.  The selection was of good quality and there were multiple items that were appetizing.  Sometimes buffets are too small and have not enough selection and this was not the case here.  The only dish missing was lentils, but I was told that the buffet selection is always changing so you never know what will be available.  I do know that on weekends they have a huge dessert table, which I will have to sample.  Buffet food was fresh and the place was pretty busy for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian food in the valley!  The variety of the menu is excellent, and you really can't go wrong--it is all great!  I really must come back during the lunch buffet sometime."}
{"text":"Was one good place in Tempe for a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"I visited this place once for their lunch buffet and I wasn't impressed.  There were many items being served: Several appetizers, veg and non veg curries, naan, rice varieties and desserts. I sampled all of them and they were just okay, some of them didn't seem very fresh and it felt like they were leftovers from the previous meal.   I have seen a lot of Indian restaurants make a similar mistake: They try to serve too many items by sacrificing the quality instead of focusing on delivering a select number of great items.   The service and ambience were great! The price was not that reasonable, with a weekday buffet costing $13 before tip."}
{"text":"Food is great! Tried different menu items and have always left with full bellies and smiles in our faces."}
{"text":"Great selection and variety with decent flavors but not as bold as others I have tried.  Inside a tired strip mall sits this well appointed indian spot, which was a buffet for our saturday lunch. ~ $12.50 each.  Pick up a plate and some Styrofoam cups for the sauces and get started. It starts with the starch, rice, flavored rice, a polenta like item and rice pillows. Then move on to the soups. After the soup the main event begins, You will fist be greeted by vegetarian dishes that become less vegan to a egg dish a fish dish then the full on meat.   A few dishes here were new to me, like the egg masla, it had a great flavor with the sauteed onion and Masala seasoning.  Next are the name sake of this place, the chutneys which were decent but again not as bold, which may be good if you have a mid-west palette.  The real surprise here was the huge desert buffet, it has the usual galub, keer but it also had items I have never seen like fried bread in a mango syrup and a dal based sweet sauce that is like caramel.    If you want to try a few new items or have a taste for the bland give this place a try."}
{"text":"Horrible and Overpriced. We ordered 2 entrees with naan and our bill was $45. Maybe that would be acceptable if the chicken tikka masala didn't taste like a can of Campbells tomato soup. Absolutely no flavor nor tasted authentically Indian. I'm sticking to my favorite, India Oven on Gilbert Rd. The quality there is fantastic at a more appropriate cost."}
{"text":"Wow, finally found a clean, very good Indian restaurant in Tempe. After being loyal to Delhi Palace and a few others that recently have gone down the drain in terms of service or quality of the food or, especially, cleanliness and decor. I asked my Indian friends for recommendations and was given Chutney's info. To Yelp I went.   My father has been all over the world and is very critical of Americanized ethnic food but I brought him here and he was SO happy! We came for the lunch buffet, which was fantastic. I wished there were more dishes out that were without dairy, but the few that were there were fantastic and I left full but not feeling like I'd just eaten a grease bomb. Indian food can be very heavy and fatty, much of which I steer clear of now. The Naan on the buffet was cold and should have been replenished quicker than it was, but all the other dishes were amazing, especially the lentil dahl and the carrot halwah dessert.   I will certainly return to this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Staff is amazing and friendly and the food is amazing. The two guys who helped us were extra helpful and helped my mother and aunt with their choices. Definitely coming back to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT! As authentic indian food as it is, finding this restaurant was like finding a gem! The chicken tikka massala and lamb curry were sooooo delicate and delicious, it made me drool just to type this. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Yelp. The whole process was very confusing and seemed to confuse the staff as much as it confused us when I called to ask some questions. The reason why that is frustrating is because I expect an establishment to be able to help me through a service they offer, and not refer me to a website that refers me to a customer support number.  We received an underwhelming amount of food for the cost, and the veggie samosas were burnt to the point of being inedible. They were so hot when they were put in their styrofoam container that they burned a large hole in the bottom. I've attached pictures of the amounts of food and the burned samosas. The delivery person rounded the total of $45.27 to $46 when he gave me the price of the food. This probably seems nitpicky, but it im in the food service industry and I think it's lazy and dishonest to do this. I'm really disappointed. Won't be eating food from this establishment again."}
{"text":"If I were strictly going to rate this place on quality and flavor of food, I would give the place 3 stars. But given the sheer number of available dishes on the buffet requires me to give it 4. I am a bit of an Indian buffet aficionado, and this place offers literally double the next highest number of dishes Ive seen at an Indian buffet.  And the food is good, too! It really is very good quality...BUT, I have had a lot better too. I like that they place naan on the buffet. I like that everything was well stocked. I liked the variety of entrees and desserts. I also liked the chai offered on the line. Really, this place is a great place to bring someone who has never had indian before or someone who wants to try a wide variety of dishes.  The service lacked. About 3/4 of the way through the meal, my father and I noticed that literally every other table had been given dosai as part of their meal. We did not receive these, and were somewhat bummed. Also, water service was lacking. The have a pitcher on each of the tables which contains just enough water to fill exactly 4 glasses. We were out of water for quite a long time and it was difficult to flag down a server.  Finally, the price was just ok. I had come to this location many times when it was Pasand, and they have remodeled and revamped everything from the decor to the menu, but Im not quite convinced that the price is worth the quality. My father seemed to really enjoy this place though, and given its proximity to our home, Im sure he will be back many times. I will probably not be back unless invited by someone else, or Im specifically in need of an Indian restaurant within a 3 mile radius of this location."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch is great. The restaurant is clean and in the right location.  Vegetarians have more options here than other Indian restaurants in the vicinity."}
{"text":"This place is short of....... AMAZING... we were in the mood for something different,  not Mexican, not Chinese, and definitely not pizza. We remembered that we have had some amazing dishes at Chutneys! Came here and they always start you off with these awesome appetizers which consists of some baked bread chips and sauces (sorry dont remember what they are called). We ordered pani puri, adorable shrimp, punjabi paneer tikka, bombay aloo, as well as the chicken vindaloo. It was all great. And the service was good even though they were really busy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Indian food! This is the real deal. Lots of variety from all different regions of India. The buffet spread was incredible. Owner and manager were extremely friendly and accommodating. In my opinion, the best Indian buffet in the Valley"}
{"text":"The restaurant has been taken over by a new management. The food is really good. We went  on a weekend and they had onam sadya . The food and quality was really good."}
{"text":"I have tried many Indian Buffet and have to say this is one of my favorites!   The food was fresh and so many flavors.  I would highly recommend Chutneys!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  If you love spicy indian food this place is heaven!!!  Definitely will come back.  Yes it was worth the drive from Cali!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 4.5 stars place. Stands way ahead in game compared to other Indian restaurants.  Ordered - Haryali Kofta : tasted good, but kinda lacked the wow factor. Maybe coz of potato and cheese combo. Worth a one time try if you like spinach based curries. Veg Manchurian : this was really dope. Would revisit this place just for this.  Ambience is clean, service was quick and obviously bollywood music."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the Indian cuisines around Tempe. Chutney's is the best of all and they do home delivery too. It's a bit on the higher side but I'll tell you it's worth what you pay. Try their mutton pepper masala and chicken biryani."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner for the first time on a Friday evening and will definitely return.   Very attentive and friendly waitstaff and owner who display their pride in the quality. They clearly want to provide the diner an excellent experience. The restaurant itself is comfortable, with Indian pop music playing in the background.  The menu is so extensive, at first we were overwhelmed. In stepped the friendly owner who helped us navigate the selections, based on our preferences. His recommendations were spot on.  Huge assortment of vegetarian fare, but also plenty of meat/chicken/lamb/fish for those so inclined.  Complimentary pappadum and condiments to enjoy while you peruse the menu.  We started with the garlic cauliflower, lightly battered and deep fried in a spicy red sauce. Delicious.  I ordered one of the paneer curries (fenugreek and cream sauce), which was delicately flavored. My husband had the mango lamb curry, perfectly spiced and stewed. Presentation was also excellent. Ample quantities, so we'll be enjoying the leftovers tomorrow too. Pricing was reasonable as well.  In summary, a well-deserved five stars. We look forward to returning and wonder what took us so long to try this place."}
{"text":"Came to eat based on the Yelp reviews of past customers. Ate buffet and we were not disappointed. Chai tea accompanies the buffet. Also ordered mango lassi - best ever!  Will return."}
{"text":"I don't remember what we ate or how to pronounce it but it was all delicious. The naan and bhatura are really good with the various curry dishes. They start with Indian style chips and dip that taste limey and like sweet bbq sauce, and they fruited water isn't tap. The portions could be better for the price but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"Great apps, very spicy (a good thing) and wonderful service. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Chi little spot in a great Tempe location. Seated quickly and provided water immediately. Waitress came to take our drink order shortly after.   Ordered the medu vada as an app and it came with a few good sauces and had great taste and texture. Had the chicken chettinad extra spicy which had really great flavor.   Solid service and good food definitely makes this a spot that I will return to. Fellow Yelpers should for sure give this place a try."}
{"text":"Fresh food and nice service. I do recommend the place. The bread is fresh and not greasy. The food is delicious. The buffet on the weekend is good to try."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Chutney's and it will not be my last.   My husband and I went in for the buffet.   The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very attentive.  The food was good and had a nice spice.   The buffet offered many vegetarian options.   I will be back ."}
{"text":"Basically an \"Indian\" place run by white people. Feels like it, anyway. The food's expensive, the wait is long, and the food is okay, with portions that are way too small. When I go Indian, I want nice cheap food that tastes awesome, with the understanding that it comes with awful service.   That being said, I can see people preferring a place like this over a more authentic experience. If you want authentic, go next door to Little India."}
{"text":"The food is decent BUT the delivery time was absolutely terrible! Short version: it took over 70 min & they flat out lied to us when we asked for the tip & delivery fee back. Full version: we ordered through Yelp eat24 & after waiting for 50 min, we called and they said the driver just left and that he was coming straight to us. It takes no more than 3 min to get to our house from them. Ten min later our food STILL hadn't arrived so we just drove to the restaurant & the person we spoke to at the restaurant called the driver, driver said he'd be 2 minutes, so we went home and waited...for another 15 minutes. They called us just after they dropped the food off & said he'd been pulled over by the cops on his way to our house, that's why he was late. Well, we didn't see anyone pulled over when we drove to the restaurant so unless he took a really, really long & out-of-the-way route, that was a lie. Then we called the restaurant back to speak with a manager, we asked for them to refund the delivery fee & tip, they said the driver wasn't affiliated with their restaurant (funny, the guy at the restaurant said he loaned the driver his car). So we contacted Eat24 & Eat24 refunded the fee & tip immediately and told us that they did not have any Yelp Eat24-affiliated drivers that were responsible for that delivery and that in fact, they do not have any Eat24 drivers at all in our entire city. That, of course, means another lie from Chutney's. Things happen & delivery drivers can be late but lying is just flat out unacceptable."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I have eaten here a couple of times. Fantastic food and friendly service - win win. I recently moved to Tucson from the Midwest and the Indian in Tucson is seriously lackluster. This is what I've been craving. Nice and spicy with great flavor. Wish there was one closer to me!"}
{"text":"OMG! Go here now! Excellent service, lamb korma and Kashmir naan were perfection. I always forget about this place and now it's back on my radar."}
{"text":"This restaurant served biryani that was way old and preserved for several days. The chicken biryani literally smells foul. It happened with me twice. I gave them a chance for the first time. But, same thing happened for the second time as well. Other dishes were okay. But, being a huge biryani fan..., it's very disappointing to see this kind of unhygienic biryani being served. Moreover the management was so careless. I hope after seeing this review, they would improve their food quality."}
{"text":"Neighborhood favorite! Such great flavors and a super friendly staff! My husband and I have been coming here for years and it is a staple for date night :)"}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in town. I have given 4 instead of 5 stars  because of the crowd for the buffet and slow table service too. I am still figuring out the best time to avoid crowd at lunch buffet :)"}
{"text":"i've gone to this place twice now. both times we had impeccable everything. cheese na'an FTW!  yes. they have cheese na'an. and rosemary. if you haven't had these from chutney's, that's why your life feels empty, now go fill it.  the people at chutney's love their customers. they go absolutely BEYOND customer service and make you feel at home. both times i've been there, i've gone with my family. which includes 2-year-old niece and a 3-year-old nephew. and they love them. our server interacts with them and makes sure they're getting what they want.  the service does not even compare to the food. we order several entrees to pass around, which is a great idea when everything eats like comfort food. and that's what chutney's serves. tasty, satisfying comfort food. the rice is impeccable. the meats, be it lamb, chicken, or beef, are perfectly melt-in-your-mouth tender. the lentil soup is absolutely mouth watering.   both time we've gone, i've ordered the chicken saag. for a reason. spinach, chicken, spices all in a wonderful sauce. i'm drooling right now. think homer simpson and donuts. my sister-in-law  has ordered the lamb tandoori. a bit spicy, but still hard to pass up.   we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in AZ, family owned run with the most amazing hospitality - fantastic customer service - Love the family!"}
{"text":"Interesting buffet.  Lots of chicken which is surprising for an Indian place.  The food was pretty tasty.  Usually Indian places are too bland for my tastes as they try to appeal to the masses.  Chutney's seems to hit a nice medium level.    Unfortunately the food was cold.  I visited at noon and a lot of the dishes seemed to be full.  I don't know if the buffet setup is incorrect - not many lids and the Tandori was covered in tinfoil - or perhaps the food was prepared ahead of time.  The place is obviously still under renovation - you can tell by the pile of junk outside the front door - so maybe the buffet is still under renovation as well.  The service was friendly but when I ordered an iced tea, the waiter brought me pre-sweetened tea.  Granted I didn't specify so perhaps it's my fault - but it did take a while for them to bring me an unsweetened tea.  I think the buffet was a bit of a bust but the food was tasty enough that I would like to try the dinner menu.  I have high hopes."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. I've been here a couple of times, the first time being the best experience I've had at this restaurant. Subsequent visits have seen a decrease in quality of service and food. My most recent visit was probably the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. The service was terrible. The waiter didn't seem completely knowledgeable about the menu, but that was the least of our problems. We waited about 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food to arrive. Other people in the restaurant who had arrived after us received their food before us. We decided to wait patiently assuming that our food took longer to prepare. When we asked the waiter what was taking so long he told us it would be a short wait and that we were \"next in line\". However, after telling us that there was a table across from us who ordered the same dish about 25 minutes after we had ordered it and they received their food before us. Once again we waited, but after another 20 minutes of waiting we decided to leave. Either they botched our order or they were playing favorites with the customers. We told the waiter we were leaving and he didn't say anything and that was it. I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This little gem serves AMAZING lamb saag and butter masala. It may take some time getting to you but it's well worth the wait.  I have yet to visit during the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"This place is a must-visit. The lunch buffet is king-size .. how many places serve 6+ desserts? And the taste of everything is authentic and great at the same time. The service is excellent as well. I go here atleast once a week."}
{"text":"I have got to say their food started out as pretty good.  The last meal I had was superb!  Go Chutney's!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends went to this place today. The ambiance is simple but good... It just opened 10 days ago but has great food... The service was great... The waiters were extremely good and helpful. They are Americans but they seem to practice a lot on their vocabulary of Indian dishes. We had mainly South Indian food. Sambhaar was brilliant. The taste was like home made. Dosas were crispy and cooked to perfection. The owner also came and met us and was very social and humble. Last course was Desserts: just too awesome to be explained. I would say the best gajar Halwa, I ate in US so far. Gulab Jamuns were very soft and they just melted in mouth. Badam Halwa was like a rich royal food. I will definitely go next week to try their North Indian delicacies. An amazing and stomach stuffing experience!!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was a disappointment. Vegetarian options were very less, Dal Makhni was dal makhni but some other daal. Sweets were not cooked properly. Usually at Indian buffets, they serve you fresh warm naans, but here they were putting naans in the buffet, and they were not fresh."}
{"text":"eek! Me thinks not, says it all. I couldn't remember why I have not been back to Chutneys since they took over from Pasand.  I remembered  that they fixed the place up but that was it.  So tonight I decided to give it another shot especially after reading some of these other reviews.   Here is the summary of my experience: Mediocre service with so so food at an above average cost equals me never going back.  There is nothing else to be said"}
{"text":"Chutneys have a lot of positive points raging from the vibrant cuisine to the good Indian food. The Indian food at Chutneys is one of the best I have had in Tempe.   I actually have a suggestion w.r.t the owner talking a lot to the customers which sometimes make me think should I go there again as I would have to hear his marketing."}
{"text":"I live 1 block away, and was very familiar with the former place \"pasand\", but usually ordered takeout from there because the place was so dingy.  I LOVE Chutney's, it looks SO much better on the inside and gives you the mexican equivalent of chips and salsa with its papads and chutney.  It opened about 2 weeks ago? and we've been there 3 times.  SO GOOD!  Have not ordered wrong yet.  Have yet to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"The quest for great Indian buffets in Phoenix continue. This is an interesting one. The weekend (Sunday) lunch buffet offered 3 cuisines with a limited selection in each. The food was alright, but the ability to sample North Indian, South Indian, Mughlai and Pav Bhaji at the same time was great. At around $13-$14, this is one of the pricier ones in Phoenix. The food is alright but I wouldn't really call it value for money. My favorite would have to be India Oven in Mesa that offers Mango Lassi (that I couldn't find anywherehere  even if it was offered) and a wider selection."}
{"text":"We were craving Indian food today and thought we would give this place another try. We tried it once after it was purchased and no longer Pasand's (which we loved). The food wasn't very good but we thought it was because they had just opened and we would try again at a later time. I looked on Yelp and there were mixed reviews but thought we would take a chance.  That being said we arrived and were very suprised that the inside had been re-vamped and was quite nice. The host was pleasant and we were seated right away.  We chose the lunch buffet and were impressed with the selection of entrees, soups and desserts. The food was just ok and I defintitely agree with past reviews that they really need to do something to keep the naan warm on the buffet or bring it fresh like most other restaurants. The real issue came when it was time for our check.  We sat for about 10 minutes after we had finished eating.  I finally went and found one of the waitresses to request our check. We then waited another 10 minutes and got up and went over to the cash register. Apparently, their credit card machine was down and they were trying to reboot.  This happens, we understand, but it didn't just happen. She knew about it when we asked for the check and didn't come back to tell us the situation. I could have left and went to the bank and got cash while my co-worker stayed there so there wouldn't have been an issue. They chose not to tell us, make us wait, and then proceed to write our credit card numbers on a torn peice of paper and hand the credit card back to us and not even say - here is your total, I appologize for your wait and the inconvience etc...- No he hands the cards back to us and takes the next persons card in line (did I mention there is a 10 person line at this time). Fortunate for the guys behind us they had time and were going to run to the bank while one guy stayed there to wait. Unfortunately for us, we needed to be back at work and had to leave our numbers just sitting out in the open for all to see:( We just hope our cards are charged correctly and our credit information is secure. We will not be going back to this restaurant and will drive the extra 8 miles to India Oven."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never actually been there, just ordered delivery, but it's usually pretty fast and convenient and really delicious. Sorry, I can't speak to the ambiance. My favorites so far are the tadka dal and the chana masala. They are wonderful! The rice is also very mildly seasoned with bay leaves and something else. It's the best rice I've ever had on the side anywhere. And it comes free with entrees, not sure what others are talking about who said they paid for rice, unless it's biryani or extra rice or something. I highly recommend this place. I can't wait to branch out and try more on the menu!  UPDATE: We've been to the restaurant now and we love it. Go check it out- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as someone who was in the US Navy, has been to India, and has had Indian buffet at a minimum of six restaurants in the last two years.  I like to check out new places and revisit old ones to update reviews.  The food here at Chutney's is good, but prices have gone up several dollars for the buffet while some Indian buffets around Tempe have not.  What I would like to see change:  Some other Indian Restaurants offer Sunday buffets with garlic naan, samosas, free drinks like Tea, soda and also sweet mango lassi included.    Here at Chutney's it's all extra, so the buffet and drinks along with tip can run well near or over $20, which is quite high.  They do have traditional hot Indian tea, which is great.  Since discovering some other Indian buffet places, I admit I'm not visiting here as much as I used to.  I do like Nandini and also Delhi Palace, and I do switch between them.  Chutney's is still good, worth checking out.    Nice Indian pop music, nice clean environment and great selection of items on the buffet including dessert.    I haven't ordered off the regular menu in quite some time as I'm only here for the buffet now.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Overpriced and sub-par food.   They had a lot of choices for the lunch buffet we tried today, but some dishes seemed stale: some of the weeks including mango custard, chilli chicken, 'jalebi'.   Overpriced."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Wednesday night at 5:30pm, so management can't blame customers for coming in late. Sad because the food is amazing, but we literally just waited almost an hour for food. The place was empty beside one other table (who were eating when we got there). Our server never said anything until after the food finally came. When we mentioned it had taken a long time, he said there was a new chef and then walked away. Dropped our checks and boxes-no apology, no thank you. We won't be back, which is unfortunate as we really thought the food was great and we live close by."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet. Great food. Amazing desserts. Carrot halwa was undercooked, noodles was cold. Refill of emptied things were nearly not fast enough. Decent service. Overall a positive experience. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic. Food is average and Staff is pathetic. They are in hospitality business and they really don't know how to treat the customers. I was going to pick food from buffet and my 3.5 year old came after me. By mistake he hit a staff member and drinks fell on the carpet. From that moment staff was so rude to the kid and me/my wife. We said sorry very and also offered to pay for the drinks. But a lady (at the counter, may be manager. not sure) made a big deal out of it knowing the fact that it was just an accident happened with 3.4 year old kid. Later they charged me for the drinks and paid for the same.  Guys it's not just about food but these guys should also know how to treat the customers however food is not out of the world but average. I will not recommend anybody to go to this restaurant. There are lot of better options in valley."}
{"text":"This is some of the most robust flavoring of Indian food in the valley. It's not dumbed down the way some some other Indian restaurants here are. Every dish tastes so different and distinctive. The lamb was a little over cooked in the saagwala, but it was still SOOO good. The samosa are so exciting for what is typically a very basic item. Everything I've ever tried is outstanding. The restaurant is so cute inside too, it's a fun, fresh, chic dining experience without trying too hard. I love this place! The owner is so awesome and proud. He is very good at what he does, and he makes every diner feel special and valued, like it's his first day running a restaurant. Every day. I recommend this to anyone who is craving good Indian food and a fun, special dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! I eat here all the time. The atmosphere is excellent and everyone is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"First to mention, the atmosphere of the restaurant is clean, family friendly, modern, and inviting. The whole restaurant smells strongly of the South Indian cuisine and it's delightful. The wait staff is very friendly, kind, and patient for a Friday night.  And the food. My wife and I went for dinner and ordered the Masaledar Lamb Chops and the Nilgiri Lamb curry, with some Roti. Both dishes were spiced 5/10 and were wonderful with and without the bread! The best Indian Food we have found in our immediate area. I would recommend this place (at least for dinner) 5 times out of 5.  I also wish to mention that we are on a very strict diet and we're able to eat here for less than $50. Score!"}
{"text":"Spent NewYears night here,  it was magnificent!!  If you enjoy Indian food this is the place for you, the food is very good!! And Anjani and the staff were amazing!!  My fiancé and I will be going back for more delicious food."}
{"text":"Owned by the most shameless and petty person, and a complete disgrace to Indians all across the world. The owner has the audacity to personally contact me and abuse me regarding wanting a refund for my order after it was 30 mins late and I was forced to stand outside in cold weather waiting for it (since I live in an apartment complex). The food was cold and the naan (bread) was stale. I called up the place before placing my order if whether they'll be able to deliver it and the owner confirmed he will be. Next day, he's abusing me that he had \"to go outside of his way\" to deliver my food and that my demand for a refund wasn't justified. Well, they just lost $25/week business. Keep up the petty behavior!"}
{"text":"I don't get it why this place is so hyped. The food is mediocre.   Long waits! The most disappointing thing is whenever I go to lunch buffets, I have to wait for certain dishes to be replenished. This is the 3rd time I went here and I haven't had their \"Pakora's\" yet (among other items) just because the dish was empty and it takes them hours to replenish it.  Too much color! I don't know what's with the color, they put too much color in food. Like the fish pakora or the grilled chicken. To me it looks unhealthy! And who puts color in \"sooji ka halwa\" !!  Curry Bowls: These are so tiny, I use TWO for the same dish!  I will not go back to this place again, there are other good restaurants I'd like to try out instead."}
{"text":"I come from IL, Chicago suburbs to be precise,  land of the Indian lunch buffets. I've never come across such a high price for a weekday lunch buffet! $14.02 is preposterous! The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 is because the food was relatively decent. I think there should be different price points for vegetarians since there are several dishes that we won't touch. My mom has been wanting to go here for a while so we did but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I really wished that I liked this restaurant but I can't. My family came for the brunch buffet. The restaurant itself is super nice and ridiculously modern and clean- I'd have to say that's the main reason why this place gets 2 stars an not 1.   The food though was just bad. I realized this isn't your typical Indian food spread- no chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, channa masala, etc. That's alright though- I was actually excited to try Indian food that was not what I was used to- - that's until I realized a lot of this wasn't even Indian- but kind of Chinese asian? And one I came to terms with that, I realized that the food just wasn't good at all. We got there when it opened expecting hot and delicious food but a lot of the fried stuff already tasted old and a lot of the food was incredibly dry. The deserts which looked delicious, were also just below average. For $15 a person, this is so not worth it. Little India is in the same intersection and I do not see any reason why I'd go to Chutney's over Little India."}
{"text":"Had a very nice variety of items on the buffett.  The restaraunt was very clean and had a good atmosphere and ambiance.  The food had a lot of flavor and the servers were very nice and eager to help.  It was bit more expensive than your stereotypical indian buffett, but the quality of the food, variety, and the atmosphere do justify the cost in my opinion.    I'll be back, my wife and I both enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food is good but the only drawback is that the lunch buffet has fewer items when compared to other places of this kind."}
{"text":"This is a veg friendly restaurant. There are a lot of options on the buffet and the staff is very helpful in pointing out what is vegan. The dining area is clean and well staffed. Overall, great customer service. The food is very good - cooked and flavored perfectly, even on the buffet."}
{"text":"This was the worst Indian food buffet experience I have ever had. We were sat down and given water with no ice  and not offered anything else to drink besides water. The food was cold. They had mutton instead of lamb. The rice was cold and not replenished. The chili chicken was overcooked and the Naan was cold and not fresh. To top it all off we were pissed when we saw or bill of 15 dollars each for a lunch buffet. We should have went to our usual place which is India oven in Mesa.  The service and food there is amazing and they bring fresh Naan to your table. I'm never eating at chutneys again."}
{"text":"Seeing a gaggle of indian college students happily walking out if this place was probably the first hint the food here would be legit... It is. The owners and staff are lovely too. I ordered a 4 (of 10) spicy though and it was still pretty damn spicy so watch that bit. The woman asked me my number so she could remember for next time. :) They're very dietary restrictions conscious too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch buffet here. Food ok. Only 2 dishes were good, goat curry and chicken Briani . The rest no taste. Service 2/10 of course not great. Wanted to have another beer but got check before asking. Yvonne didn't even ask if I needed anything else before bringing the check. No thank you. It's like they are doing you a favor. When it should be the other way around."}
{"text":"Chutneys is very authentic place to have one of the best Hyderabadi biryani's in the Arizona area. The Vijaywada Biryani is top notch and has a lot of rich flavor. The service and ambience are really good and the servers are very nice."}
{"text":"The food is great here only if you're willing to wait almost an hour... There seems to be an overflow of people and a minimum amount of workers, so our table was left alone. I hope they would hire more staff then I would consider returning."}
{"text":"Two years ago, I had the pleasure of eating out at this restaurant several times. There were plenty of vegetables and meat selections for a Paleo-oriented eater like myself. But then the management changed hands.  The buffet changed. Everything consisted of (cheaper) carbs and heavy sugared sauces that aren't even Indian based, but which are horrid knockoff versions of adulterated Chinese.  I gave this newly managed restaurant two tries, and then gave up. Awful food, at least for the buffet. If you want healthy Indian, skip the buffet (I don't know what the a la carte menu is like) and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The taste is good. Although its pretty expensive. And the space is quite crammed too. Its one additional choice in the valley - but i doubt i would go a second time."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch buffet with one other person. I was excited because I have not found any good Indian restaurants in the area. I went in and saw lots of people and good variety in the buffet. Sadly the food was not that good. First, the food was cold which made the chicken kind of hard and everything in general much less enjoyable. Plus the flavors were really mild compared to actual Indian food. The butter chicken was okay but was really watery. There was a good vegetable variety so I guess that is good for vegetarian people. The service was kind too.  Although it wasn't a bad experience, it wasn't memorable at all. I don't think I would come back for the buffet. And especially not to order directly from the menu... never have a seen naan for $2.5 and biryani more than $15. So overpriced!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.. Authentic style . True Indian taste ..Would definitely love to go back again .."}
{"text":"Great selection of food and excellent flavor. Loved the new addition, palak chat, to the appetizer menu. This is my new favorite Indian restaurant in town."}
{"text":"BEST LUNCH BUFFET IN PHOENIX HANDS DOWN! A little pricey though($10.95 (?) on weekdays & $12.95 on the weekends), but TOTALLY worth it..Huge selection of dishes (Brunch,Desserts) & great taste! I recommended this one to more than a dozen folks & everyone seemed to like it..They have idli/dosai/vada/pongal for b'fast & the sambar is good. Lot of veg/non-veg entrees to choose from & best part is the biryani(generally egg/chicken/goat, no veg) is included with the buffet! Wide variety of desserts & this is the only restaurant (from the ones I dined) that serves gulab-jamun HOT!   On the other side - Service is really bad & they'll need to improve by miles, if they want to get their act together!  Final Verdict: ANYTIME! ANYDAY!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in phoenix area. The buffet has a wide varieties of the most delicious desserts. Great ambiance and very flavorful food. The owner is always there to greet you. That's the only Indian restaurant we go to when we feel like eating Indian and my son loves their tandoori chicken and rasam."}
{"text":"Chutney's is a good option for a night when you're craving curry if it's nearby.  The Good: Chutney's has some great flavors and the meats in the curry are beautifully cooked. Portion sizes are generous and served piping hot.  The Not-So-Good:  - Ambiance: The ambiance leaves much to be desired. The lights are up too high, some of the place mats are partially pulled apart. It has a banquet hall or sizzler feel that doesn't match the mid to high price point for the entrees.   - Service: The service seems forced and a bit arrogant. The one waiter seemed to have little to no knowledge of what was in stock in the bar, and he poured and served me the wrong beverage. When I asked about there being another location, the server downplayed the other location stating that the Tempe location is bigger and has more chefs. He literally snarled his nose as he was talking about it and telling me not to go there, to come to the Tempe location.   - Alcohol: If you're ordering draft beer, you should be aware that it's a 10 ounce pour at 12 oz to 16 oz prices.    - Prices: While the prices are not wildly out of line like some places I've visited, the things I mention above make me feel as though Chutney's should be offering a lower price for a less than premium product. They were slightly more than the best curry restaurant I've found in town."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Servers are very helpful and owners are passionate about their food. Definitely a great place for Indian cuisine :)"}
{"text":"Chutneys has stepped up their game since i reviewed them in july last year.The owner has now taken the reins of this restaurant into his own hands and the difference is remarkable. They are clearly making an effort here. The Buffet spread is one of the best in the valley,they have a huge spread.A lot of variety from biryani to kebabs ,chaats to south indian dishes like dosas,vadas etc.  The only thing i would say is that the desserts were not up to the mark, they had several types of halwas and ladoos very colorful and pleasing to the eyes but the taste was a let down.My suggestion would be to include desserts like rasgullas,gulab jamuns and jalebis which are popular favorites  Overall definitely worth a visit.They also keep having different events which are open to the public.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My family jokes that we had a 15 year committed relationship with our previous Indian food restaurant that ended once we found Chutney's.  Sometimes we come for the weekend buffet, which has a huge variety, love the chai and all the chutneys.  Other times we come for dinner.  Usually we get the dosa since I can't eat naan.  The dosa is amazing.   We came down one night when they had live music and wow, the guy turned out to be a top notch jazz musician from Seattle.    Other reviewers have written about the slowness of the service, but I think that people should recognize that Chutney is not a place for speed dining.  This is a place where one comes to relax, enjoy a leisurely meal, soak up the ambiance.  It's a great place for a date, or enjoy a night out with friends.  It's good for conversation."}
{"text":"I've dined and gotten to go orders from here more frequently and I've always had fast and friendly service. This Friday's lunch buffet was memorably spectacular, with a large dessert and cold dish row, and numerous delicious dishes including a lovely fried fish (A special item not found on the regular menu but oh so good), idli, dosa, and various biriyani. There were 2 different soups available and free chai tea to the side. The manager(?)/owner(?) stopped by at our table and recognized me as a frequent patron and welcomed my friend to the restaurant. Upgrade one star for quality and friendliness!  P.S. All their meat is halal for those that have religious dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Bad customer support , can't even tell menu to customer when they call to enquire or order."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been ordering from Uber eats frequently. The fried cauliflower is amazing!!!! Big fan."}
{"text":"Will never go to this restaurant again! They made us wait for the food for hour and a half and the food was disgusting. And after waiting for hour and a half didn't even comp us a soda neither did they apologize and on top of that when we told them that we are never coming back the manger was smiling. It's ridiculous!! They don't care for customer service. Never again are we going there . I am giving  one star so that I can post my review. They deserve no stars at all."}
{"text":"I am from India. Have tried many Indian Restaurants in and around Phoenix area and have high expectations from an Indian restaurant. Chutney's is by far the Best one. The quality of food is Great. The Variety is the best. You will never find such a wide variety anywhere in Phoenix Area.  And all this for just $12.95 on weekend. It is the BEST INDIAN RESTAURANT in and around Phoenix"}
{"text":"The gateway to authentic Indian food in Arizona. Awesome food awesome host. We went there for a friends birthday treat and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"The food has So many delicious flavors. Service was warm and welcoming. They serve Indian beer too! Very good! Always make room for dessert! You won't be disappointed! I promise! Their food is made with love! You can taste it!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my girlfriend, the food is amazing and service is excellent. The veg starters are a great way to kick off a dinner packed with great spices."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have eaten in a restaurant.  The service is over the top.  I went there in the middle of the week for lunch and a buffet was offered as well as the full menu.  The host took me through each and every dish in the buffet, to include the sauces, and what sauces were best for each entree.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the prices reasonable.  Because of the sign, I have always thought this was a Mexican restaurant, until my R man took me there last week.  I am so happy to have found this place and look forward to supporting their success by telling everyone I know about it.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place around 2013 when they took over Pasand and I thought it was just average. However the past few months I have been going and have noticed the big increase in quality. The owner is back in control and is making sure that the food is top notch. I go there for lunch every Saturday and its a complete buffet with a lot of variety. Last nite I took my Mom to eat there and she has to eat less salt. The owner waiter and chef made sure they made the food according to her needs. They are very attentive and are open to customer feedback. They have my support and always will. Get the Lamb Pepper Masala, its delicious."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at chutneys. What a disappointment.  Unlike many Indian restaurants, chutneys ONLY offers a buffet at lunch time  (no food cooked to order). We were looking forward to the dosas that are seen on the website.  The \"dosas\" served at the buffet were like thick doughy pancakes that were lukewarm.  The naan bread is cooked ahead and is kept warm on the buffet line, not hot and fresh.  The currys, paneer, and Dahl were not bad, but I'd rate them as average.  I showed the waitress a photo of the dosas from their website and she said they are available at dinnertime. Considering what they called a dosa at their lunch buffet, I have my doubts that they can make one worth returning at dinner time for."}
{"text":"Just awesome, Iove indian food, and the appetizers they brought me was a red sweet source with onions in it.  The best, and the lamb rogan josh is the best.  Must have, 4 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I love indian food and vegetable korma is my favorite. My husband and went in to try this place as the past restaurant in this location was not good at all. The inside is totally redone and very pretty. Service was quick, we choose the buffet which for two people was a bit steep over 35.00 for two people. I enjoyed it and might return if I had a coupon or groupon but don't think I would pay full price. The vegetable korma was very spicy which I didn't care much for."}
{"text":"I'm floored by the quality of the food here.  The server pointed out several items to help us have an authentic experience."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on their takeout. I ordered the chicken vindaloo and an order of naan and was shocked at pickup when my bill was almost $18. On top of that, when I got home I realized how small the portion size is. I am used to having enough for 2 meals with one order and there is only enough for one. The food, however, is delicious and I enjoyed it immensely although I probably would not try it again based on their prices."}
{"text":"Noticed this new Indian place near our house so I thought we'd give it a shot.  The first impression as we walked in the door was very positive, decor and ambiance were a step up from the previous establishment that was in this location.  Service was also good - prompt and responsive, but that's where the positives end.   Food was where they fell short with most items we ordered lacking in flavor.  We ordered a tandoori chicken and saag paneer, both were OK at best, the garlic naan was pretty good but it's hard to go wrong with that.  Being a native Indian I have pretty high expectations for indian food so I can only give them 3 starts based on the food.  It's a new place so hopefully things will improve as they get established.  I might try it again for the lunch buffet in a few months."}
{"text":"Last night we decided to try this place out, since we use to go to Pasand all the time. Upon arriving, you can tell they did a major renovation of the place. We were the first to be seated in our section, but the LAST to be served. Our meal turned out to be a two hour dinner, our server was no where to be found and the owner was as clueless as the staff. We noticed that all the \"natives\" were served first before everyone else, which is a HORRIBLE way to do business.   The food was decent when we got it 75 minutes after we were first seated. It took 15 minutes to ask someone to get our bill and when the so-called server returned, he didn't even bring one. They are lucky that I didn't dine and dash, but I bet that they wouldn't have even noticed.   The service needs to improve or they won't last. But I wouldn't even waste your time or money going here because they honestly don't care about improving."}
{"text":"I'm not of big fan of Indian cuisine but this was well made, the place was clean and the service was good. Located in a strip mall that could use an overhaul."}
{"text":"My first experience with Chutney's was a New Year's party with a friend of mine.  The food itself was very tasty and deligtful.  In fact, my wife an I returned on a first Friday to catch the live jazz.    However, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this review.  One of the things I enjoy eating is the naan bread.  Their naan is prepared in a tandoori oven which gives the bread an excellent consistency and flavor.  We have had different dishes each visit and they have been very consistent with presentation and taste.  A few months ago, I decided to bring my Toastmasters group in for their Chef's Table.  If you have not experienced this, you are missing a true treat.  This six course meal will leave you very satisfied and VERY full.  The Mullitgitawny soup was sublime with its delicate balance of flavors.  The show stopper was the garlic cauliflower.  To this date, I still run into Toastmasters who talk about how good this dish was.  The 65 chicken is also very tasty.  I have been relaying these raves back to Shilpa, the manager and she leaves with a smile on her face.  The main entrees of choice are very tasty and customers are given a choice of spicy or mild.  The desserts are pretty tasty as well.  Speaking of Shilpa, she is a delight to work with.  I worked very closely with her in setting this up.  She did everything promised and then some.  Any concerns I had were dealt with in a very professional and expedient manner.  But even if we don't do the chef's table often, we will still return because of the quality of the food and the excellent live jazz that leaves a good note with us."}
{"text":"Nice flavorful food. We had two types of Dosas, Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala and two type of Naans.   Staff and manager are very attenetive. During the course of the meal three different people came by to make sure that we had what we needed. Very attentive.  Reasonably priced.  We're definitely going back.  Food preparation timing could be improved so all the dishes come out about the same time but seriously, that is a non-issue."}
{"text":"The place is very clean. Staff was wonderful. Ordered harbenero naan most soft delicious naan I've had in Arizona . Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a big improvement on the Pasand. Decor much improved and tastefully done. plus clean bathrooms.  Have had the buffet lunch several times over the last 6 months. Food has been been consistently very good on our visits with a great selection for vegetarians.  I'd say they are a little on the expensive side for the buffet - so marked them down for that  - otherwise a good choice.  Get's pretty busy after 12 - with a ton of Indian folks coming in for lunch, but they seem to be able to cope ok.  Have not had a chance to try the Dinner menu yet.  11/23/12 Update  Overall the lunch buffet food selection is great. Very tasty - good section of meat and vegetarian options. Probably one of the best Indian buffets around.  Best if you can get there at say 11:30 since buffet can get pretty busy at 12 - though they do seem to handle the people pretty efficiently. I guess it's a good sign that there are so many Indian folks going there for lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on Sunday  (4-10-2016). This place was pretty nice walking in. Without getting into details of the surroundings, let me get right into the food. I ordered a plate with lamb. I wish I could remember the name of the plate, but it was $18.00 and it was lamb, My wife had a spicy curry chicken (again, I don't remember the exact name). The lamb was a bit over cooked. It was a very \"well done\" (like leather) cut of meat. I've always cooked or ordered my lamb medium to medium rare, but I wasn't asked how I would like it cooked when my oder was taken. It came out on a hot iron skillet with veggies surrounding the lamb drying to a crisp. I was also given a Bowl of white rice to complete my plate.  On a scale of 1-10 for my order, I would give it a 4. The meat was to dry, veggies were dried as well. On the other hand, I like what they were doing with the flavor. Had the meat been rescued from the oven maybe 10 minutes earlier with about 5 minutes to rest, the plate would have been phenomenal!  Let me backup to drinks. They brought to our table a pitcher of water that had citrus slices and possibly mint marinating at the bottom. This water, although looking refreshing, was far from it. It was room temperature, if not warmer and served in room temperature glasses, not one cube of ice was even offered. So far this was the only type of drink we were offered. My wife finally asked a table runner if we could order drinks, he quickly got the attention of a waiter (not ours). I ordered an iced tea, my wife ordered a really good orange looking drink (mango lassi). Iced tea is supposed to have ice in it. I literally counted 3 cubes of ice. I didn't want to be rude and ask for ice so my wife \"manned up\" and got ice.........for herself! \"im still running warm here guys\"! End of the drink story. At the end of our dinner, our waiter gave us free desert cubes (those were amazing). I agreed to give my honest review of this restaurant just as I promised our waiter and here it is.  In all, the service was slow (took close to 35 minutes), my food was over-cooked, the drinks were warm (No ice) and we had to ask for our drinks. So will I go back? Absolutely! This is a review that I know they will read. I'll order the same thing, hopefully be given the option on how I would like my lamb cooked, hopefully be given iced water, hopefully they will ask for my drink order and hopefully those drinks will be nice and cold with lots of ice.  One thing I forgot to mention. The workers there were so extremely nice, very welcoming! That alone would get me to go back as well. Smiling faces are always a huge plus and there was no lack of smiling faces there. Kudos to you guys!"}
{"text":"Best indian food around! The buffet always has lots to offer. We love going during our lunch break- options for vegan and vegetarians too! Service is quick. Great prices!  Love the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quantity served. Taste is ok, not worth the price. Not evn complimentary papad served..strange..& kept us waiting for the food."}
{"text":"I have ample time to write a review as I have given up all hope of eating. It's been over thirty min since I ordered. Glad I ordered entree with appetizers. And now I have received the chicken 65 as if it were fried chunks of presumably over cooked chicken. My drink never came. And I am livid! Never coming back. Only Take the number of customers you can handle. Put them on wait list. But don't be greedy and keep me hanging."}
{"text":"1. Food quality varies each day. they need to be more consistent. 2. Need to improve the service. Waitress and servers are gracious, but its very under staffed and disorganized. I have seen a couple of guests totally getting pissed off at the way the owner runs it. I dont see much issue with the staff. But I myself has seen the owner who did a couple of violations right infront of me. He needs to improve. 3. The biryani taste is over powered by spices which needs to be toned down. If not there is no differentiation between this and other Indian restaurants in Phx."}
{"text":"Well, well...the standards for Indian cuisine in the Phoenix just continue to rise and rise. Just a few short days after discovering Matka, I tried Chutney's, which is located in the space formerly occupied by Pasand.   For those of you who have been to Pasand, just forget all about that. The new owner has gone all out on the new place. The furniture is all new, new bar, new kitchen, new buffet table. Everything is shiny and clean and just a little upscale-looking. But for the three or four people out there that actually read my reviews, you'll know that ambience and décor are at the bottom of my list when it comes to judging a restaurant--service, flavor and price are what is important. Fortunately, Chutney's has all three covered in abundance.   The owner is a great host. For the people who look a little lost, he quickly steps in, giving them a tour of the buffet, which has a very generous number of selections (I have not been here for dinner yet). Several times during our visit he stopped at our table to let us know of something new coming out of the kitchen, or to recommend some dish or drink. Our waiter was also very good, knowledgeable and attentive. Pretty good considering how new the place is.   The food was great. My wife and I are still debating which we liked better--Matka or Chutney's. I guess the only solution is to each Indian twice as often and go back and forth between the two. I mentioned the selection--very large with six chicken dishes alone, not to mention numerous veggie selections and lots of other stuff.   Price is about what you expect--$10.99 per person and $6.99 for kids. I'm not sure if price and selection varies on weekdays--we visited on a Sunday.   I live just down the street from this place. I intent to be a very regular customer."}
{"text":"Wow everything I've tried here is super good!  I usually go with something spicy and vegetarian.  They're a little more pricey than other Indian places nearby, but worth a try."}
{"text":"Well I am an Indian Cuisine Virgin no longer . . . and . . . I am now an Indian Cuisine Fan.  A co-worker has been after me for some time to try indian cuisine, but I always had an excuse.  Well, today, she cornered me and said we are going . . . only concession . . . I got to choose the restaurant.  Chutney's Indian Cuisine it is.  I am so glad that this restaurant has a llunch buffet, because I had no idea what I would have ordered.  So I tried a little of everything . . . and . . . I loved it ALL.  The chicken, the goat, the eggplant, the curries, I could not get enough.  All were fresh, hot, and just enough spice to give everything a nice kick.  I think I may have made a mistake tough . . . while I am now willing to go out for indian cuisine . . . I hope the bar was not set to high.  Chutney\"s I will be back . . . and for the rest of the Indian Cuisine Restaurants . . . look out, I will be coming your way soon."}
{"text":"Worst buffet ever had in Arizona. Most of the non veg items are stale and there was no mutton in mutton biriyani."}
{"text":"Very bad service .. took them 20 minutes to tell us that they do not have ketchup .. the food is also horrible. One of the worst Gobi Manchurian dish I have tasted."}
{"text":"For me, Indian food must have the right level of spice and spiciness. That means they have to use a certain blend of really intense spices and also make me sweat. Of course, I told the chef to give me the hottest and darn right he did.  Taste I went here with about 8 of my crew. What was awesome is that we had an Indian guy order some awesome dishes we could try.  I apologize if I butcher the names of almost all of the Indian food but I need to tell you, I enjoy the heck out of Indian food.  Appetizer - The appetizer laid out this spiced flatbread and three different types of chutneys but the only distinct one was the red pieces that looked and tasted like candied onions. The other two sauces are typical indian fare. A sweet red sauce and a green, almost minty green sauce. The flat bread had cumin baked into it. It was a light appetizer.  Garlic Cauliflower- Ordered as an appetizer and it literally looks like Sweet and Sour Pork. I'd argue it tasted like it too. I didn't think it was worth $8.00 but it was pretty good. Decently spicy but I've had garlicier foods.   Pepper Lamb Rogenjosh - I asked for the hottest Masala they could give me and here I got a very spicy pepper lamb masala. In hindsight, I kind of regretted it because it was hard for me to distinguish the flavor of this one because there was so much heat. I guess I should have listed to the table: never ask an indian chef to make it the \"hottest you can make it\".  Chicken Marsala - Standard orange-sauced chicken Masala. If you haven't had it before, you can describe it as the most basic Indian dish you could get. I'd recommend this for beginners who have no idea about Indian food. In general, theirs did the job.  Vegetarian Dumpling Masala - This yellow sauced dish had pretty big dumplings in it. Upon further inspection, and taste, I noticed that it was potato-based. I only tried a little bit but it was pretty good for a vegetarian dish. It reminds me a lot of a very thick Chicken and Dumplings Soup but with much more curry in it.  Puri - We had two what looked like relishes on our table. They tasted very refreshing and because my food was way too spicy, we got this to cool our palates down.  Masala Dosa - The most impressive dish by far was the Dosa, a gigantic crepe filled with spiced potatoes. My Indian friend said that this crepe was made of rice flour and tasting it, you can tell it was a bit sour which means the dough has been fermented a bit. Either way, this crispy, delicious piece of work has this spicy potato filling in it that reminded me a lot of the vegetarian dumpling curry my friend had.   Naan bread - The naan bread was charred and delicious. We like to go all out and order a lot of Naan. We ordered regular naan, buttered naan, the garlic naan and the filled naan. I would say the best naan I had there was definitively the buttered naan.  Ambiance There's a weird Indian MTV station that played in the background. In general, the theme of the restaurant radiates with a glow of \"yellow warmth\" with specs of rosy red due to the color of the silverware. The rice and masala dishes come in these legitimate metal pots that may look deceptively small, but the content fills you up fast.  Service My friend told me that the manager said one of their servers was gone today so our food was slower than normal. Either way, they had great service or the waiters were very friendly. I had the spiciest masala and they kept giving me pitchers of water to drink.  Cost About $20 dollars a meal. Disclaimer is that we as a group ordered a lot of food. Main course is usually about $12-$15 dollars and the extra pieces of naan, appetizers, and relishes made the price rise a bit. Since we all ate each other's food, we decided to split the bill evenly.  Selection A traditional Indian food restaurant is like a traditional Chinese food restaurant. It needs a huge menu to feel legit. Chutney's has a lot of items and it is presented in a nice, Silk-Road-like feel.  Overall Chutney's is a great place for your Indian fix. I unfortunately can't tell you the best Indian restaurants in Phoenix mainly because I don't go out of my way to eat it as often as sushi, noodles, Chinese food and Korean food. I guess I'll have to go to more Indian restaurants. Do you have any Indian restaurants that are a must-go in the Phoenix area?"}
{"text":"Was very good & the staff very friendly.   What more can you ask for.  Great food. Great service.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Since the menu and chefs have been replaced, this place has acquired a serious one two Knockout your tastebuds PUNCH! Love the food! The flavor profiles are so intense, adventurous, and pleasurable. The restaurant is so aromatic. My senses are primed upon entry to this wonderful establishment. The owner has been available to meet and discuss my experience every time. Never to busy and absolutely eager to please his customers. Clean restaurant that produces AMAZING food = I'll be back and tell EVERYONE I know. Thanks again for the wonderful experience. My tastebuds await our next encounter."}
{"text":"Go to lunch buffet. Its awesome food for food lovers both in quantity and quality manner. Addition to all those large number of varieties, they give dosa which i liked. Service is also good."}
{"text":"Not as good as it was when it was Pasand but better than many other Indian Places around. Has a decent lunch buffet as well.  The place is nice and clean and has a nice ambience as well. The owner is kinda hard to talk to so don't bother with trying to start conversation. He isn't interested.  They took down the buffet while we were still eating without asking us if we were done. We were done but still, would have been nice to be asked since it was only 2 mins after the buffet ended."}
{"text":"3.5 - Love the new digs.. nice tables and ambiance.   Wife got lamb curry @ 2 spice levels,,, was mild but a whole lotta flavor I got the Shrimp Vindaloo @ 5 spice levels... heat,, mm heat,,,  very flavorful as well, sauce was awesome to dip the garlic bread in,   not a huge fan of basmati rice though,,, with you had choice of Jasmine,, but all in all we will be back,,  thanks,  FYI: Front door isn't just a pull on handle, you need to press the top lever then pull, almost seemed like the place was closed..."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot abt this place and being an Indian, was craving for some authentic food, so went along with friends for their saturday lunch buffet. The lunch started with the chat items as starters- Aloo tikki, chole, bhel and vada pav- all very nice. Tha main course has Sambhar, Rassam, Mysore vada, onion bhajia, rice, biryani, aloo mutter, palak paneer for the vegetarians. Didnt hv a look at the non veg menu.  While that looks like a lot of dishes, they all somehow didnt go well with one another.   While the taste itself was authentic enough, Ive had better Indian food in tempe. The taste wasnt exactly memorable enough for me to recommend this place wholeheartedly. The gulab jamun and fruit salad made for nice end though.  The decor of this place is classy and very contemporarily indian, so thumbs up for that. Between the 8 of us, the bill came to $132, which included an 18% 'Large Party' charge, which is charged to groups of more than 6 people (absurd american custom).  Thats definitely on the pricey side.   In short, if u wanna have decent indian food in a classy ambiance, worth a visit. But keep the expectations low"}
{"text":"Ordered carryout: Paneer Tikka Masala and Navratan Korma. Wasn't a fan of the flavors. The paneer dish was better than the korma dish because of the sauce. The paneer dish here was not as good as good as other restaurants. The basmati rice was also a little different in a slightly unfavorable way.   Indoor furniture and ambiance is nice but I prioritize food taste."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Indian food... They are consistent! Great service.. I had given some feedback earlier on items that didn't taste good and they took corrective actions and made it even better!  Great attitude and service.. Worth giving a shot!"}
{"text":"Forget the old Pasanad and HELLO Chutney's!  The owner is bringing what real Indian food should look and taste like directly from the culinary capital of the world: San Francisco!  Order the \"Lollipop Chicken\" when it is being served and keep going back for more as, compared to Pasand, you have many options for your entree.  The only set-back outside of the new bright and cheery interior is the wait-staff is fairly young and inexperienced.  Ordering a dry martini was a challenge and was sent back as I basically got  a glass of vermouth and vodka-- not shaken, not stirred.  Why have a bar if you don't know how to use it?  Best bet:  stick with the Flying Horse beer.  A delicious way to wash down the spicy European influenced cuisine.  The joy and happiness the owner brings to environment is a welcomed changed form that dreary, drab, processed Indian food serving Pasand was.  Night and day.  Once the staff is up to snuff, this will be a five start rating for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but pricey.  Service could be better.  Check your credit card bill, they add more tip than I put on my receipt.  Going to dispute."}
{"text":"This is a nice sit down area to eat good quality Indian food. Try their fish curry and lamb byriani....very yummy and you can set to whatever spice level you want. They also have specialty cocktails you can order like coconut rum. Service itself was great....though I suggest kind of back off from checking on your customer so often by 3 different people.....or questions about which other Indian restaurant you tried....let the food do the talking....if you need to check on other Indian restaurants...you can use yelp!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and bad service. The waiters and the owners have no sense of customer service. Really rude behavior. I had a bad experience,  will not be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back for more. I came with a fairly large group and we enjoyed all the dishes. There was a mix of vegetarian and non vegs ordered for the different preferences.  Some dishes we ordered: paneer tikka, saag paneer, butter chicken, lamb igaru, egg curry, chilli paneer, baby corn chili, manchurian..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Food is always fresh and service is very nice. They are closed 1 day during the week and of course that's always the day I forget and go only to find the doors locked. Very nice though! This place always hits the spot... when they're open."}
{"text":"Love this Tempe gem. Have been to this restaurant a number of times and have consistently been met with friendly and knowledgable staff who cater to your needs.  Key points include but are not limited to;   The Best naan I've ever had. A number of fantastic veggie dishes.  Well priced drinks Healthy servings"}
{"text":"I had the creepiest dining experience I have had in a long time here the other night. I had been once before (I can't believe I didn't review...) for the lunch buffet about a year or two ago and it was really good... there was a wide variety of food and all was tasty....anyway, flash forward to last week, I went for dinner with a friend. We were one of two parties there and it was eerily quiet. Our waitress was a bit odd, but nice enough... the food was expensive and they were trying to push drinks and appetizers and whatnot....I felt like they were a bit disappointed when we just shared one entree and some naan. We got the chicken tikka masala, and it was good, but not as good as I had remembered it from the buffet. About half way through the meal, we were the only people in the restaurant (at like 6:45), and it felt like the employees were all staring at us...they had nothing else to do, it was just an odd feeling. I would consider going back for the lunch buffet, but don't think I would eat there for dinner again."}
{"text":"The bad reviews must be old,  this place is fantastic! The food is always excellent and the service is friendly and attentive. Seems like they get a late rush, Monday we were in at 7 and the place was empty but by 8:30 there were at least 10 tables full. If you like Indian food or have never tried it you should check it out."}
{"text":"Food was good. Spice was right, seasoning was right. Would recommend only think I wish the portions were bigger."}
{"text":"The fried fish appetizer was extremely impressive where ot tasted like Tandoori Chicken without the stench of the fish.  Most fry fish will fall apart without battering which is a rare innovation upon fryer.  The lamb briyani was tender and garnished with yogert, mint, and one other spice sauce.  The mango lassi was crisp instead of thick amd griddy.  In many ways, this restaurant never stopped to impress me since I was trained as a chef/restauranteur.  Slight problem with redemption of Entertainment offer.  The owner claimed he didn't sign the 25% contract with the publication so 5% discount were offered.  I didn't want to argue so I just paid was asked.  Will return soon."}
{"text":"great flavors.....lacking in quantity...maybe 1-2 oz or lamb on $14 dinner...."}
{"text":"Delicious indian food in the phoenix area. Some of the south indian dishes were not upto the mark."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! People who like spicy food... This is the place! You should try the burning bullet naan.. It's burning hot!!!  Veg mushroom masala is so mouth watering. Mushrooms cannot be be cooked so good than this.the quantity of the dishes look small but when you actually dig in there's a lot. Should try this restaurant. It's like the actual Indian food!!!"}
{"text":"OH-EMM-GEE!  My daughter and I went here for the lunch buffet on Sunday, and the food was absolutely amazing!  I don't know enough about Indian food to tell you about all of the individual dishes, but everything I tasted (which was just about everything offered in the buffet) was DELISH!  The servers were attentive, and the owner was very friendly.  The cost is $10.95 per person, which seems pretty standard to me, given the number of choices and the quality of the food.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Last night we went for this place. I am from India and we were apprehensive about it. But to surprise us all this restaurant excel in our expectations. The ambiance was awesome with light background tamil/hindi music. The food taste was authentic. The service was prompt and courteous. A great place to go when you are hungry. The dosa and biryani were awesome."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch buffet. This one provides the most number of options than Indian restos in and around Tempe-Chandler. Food overall is pretty good. No disappointments. Good naan and dosas. Not all but some of fish, chicken and goat dishes are really tasty. Mostly North Indian cuisine, some South Indian food and little chaat. Place is usually crowded. Ambience is decent with Indian antiques around. Customer service is good but slow. I found them short of waiters both the times I visited."}
{"text":"This review is based on a dinner experience (Maybe the lunch buffet is great because you get to SERVE YOURSELF).  The food, was good...but not great. The okra in the soup we ordered wasn't cooked thoroughly, and was hard. The flavors in the Samosas were nice, as was the Palak Paneer...but again, it wasn't anything I couldn't get at the Supermarket from a box.  In addition, most places include naan with your meal... but at Chutney's, they charge 2.50 for two pieces. Seems like a rip off.  Let's get to the worst part.  Our time spent in the restaurant - TWO HOURS. This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. \"I think we're missing naan.\"  \"Ohhh, right...\"    \"Did you need anything else?\"  \"Yes, the soup?\"  Then at the end of our poorly timed meal, plates still filled with food, they brought the check. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert, or boxes.  Now, the guy who brings the water and bussed the table: He was on the ball! Promote him to a server position, because the girls leisurely walking around the restaurant? Can't hack it.  I miss when this place was Pasand : ("}
{"text":"Oh boy where do I start! Let's begin by the fact that I've traveled pretty much all around the globe and eaten all kinds of food. I had high expectations going to this place as I heard a lot buy it seems even some locals don't know what good food is. Poor management. We waited over an hour for food to come out. It came out individually and so everyone was out of sync. This is especially a problem when the adults food is there but not the kids ! The food itself was totally inedible. Runny vegetables, tough meat, cold starters , overly spicy soup. It was generally a nightmare to eat at and a lot of the food seemed like it was frozen prior to being cooked. The butter chicken was also lost all marsala (see picture). When we complained the manager (owner) disagreed which was really not doing him any favours. We didn't eat most of the food, got charged inflated prices for stuff which should be been cheaper even if it was good quality, and left hungry. Saved your money and go somewhere else - even Mcdonalds. Would give it ZERO stars if I could"}
{"text":"They charge u $13 for an entree n their quantity is so less ... There is no Indian restaurant that charges so much for so less quantity ... Priciest with mediocre quality food"}
{"text":"This is indeed a great place for Indian cuisine. From decoration, clean & beautiful silverwears, delicious food and gret services. Everything is just so perfect! We came here on Friday night and was seated rather quickly. I ordered a mango juice and it was very delicious. It has the right amount of sweatness in it with little pieces of mango in it. They also serve Papadum with 3 different types of dipping sauce. For entree, I ordered a sweet chicken Korma curry dish. The curry sauce was absolutely favorable with the right amount of chicken.   Service was absolutely outstanding. The manager (possibly the owner), our waiter and a guy who delivers food from the kitchen to the floor all work together to provide everyone with services. I have to guess that this is a family business. I also cannot stop watching the Indian music videos that they play....love their culture and outfit.   I'll definitely come back here again for more and try their lunch buffet that my friend has been talking so much about."}
