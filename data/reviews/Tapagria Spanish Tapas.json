{"text":"Great food. Great service. I've had bone marrow at some of the best restaurants in California and the one here made my top 3 list. Basil and peach Sangria was delish!"}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's day and ordered their specials - the fish dish and prime rib. Both exceeded our expectations...

I hope they do the fish special again though... Best fish I have had at a restaurant for awhile.. so juicy and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch. Heard good things but the quality of the food was beyond my expectations. 

Dishes that were excellent: seared foie gras,  bone marrow, eggplant crudo, Spanish toast. 

Dishes that were good but we likely will try something else next time: Charcuterie meat platter, olives.

Dishes we wouldn't order again: skirt steak (was chewy). 

The service was good but slow. It's expensive but food was excellent. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant.  The portions are REALLY small but very pricey!  The paella was drenched with butter and garlic.  I like the taste of butter and garlic, but it was way too much... to the point that it was unbearable.  The seafood tasted like it had gone bad.  We left more than half of the paella untouched.  It was very disappointing.  The double bone marrow was equally disappointing.  18 bucks for two bone marrows with a few pieces of burnt baguette?  Seriously!  The bone marrows could have been only two spoonfuls.  As for Jamon de Iberico, I don't know why it was recommended as it was just like any other prosciutto.  22 bucks for that!!! The portions were very small for that too... WAY too small when compared to other Tapa places.  

The waitress was not friendly either.  I waited about 15 min before she came with menu.  Sooo not attentive or friendly except when it was time to pay.  She was VERY attentive then.  

I went to Congee Queen after to cleanse my palette and to fill my stomach. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a Very nice decorated restaurant. The foods were okay but bit greasy and over priced. We had few hot tapas and paella, the portions are good for sharing. 

Is good to try if you never been there, but may not come back often."}
{"text":"Bone marrow was delicious!

Spanish Toast was even more delicious!!

To top it all off, I had a birthday cake on the house because I have super awesome friends!!!

Yeah really, my friends are better than yours!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch. the food was good. the service was excellent. 
why did I say that? I had to take a business call in between my meal. the manager took my food back and gave me fresh food because it was cold... that is service!

the food tasted good too."}
{"text":"Wifey and I celebrated my birthday here and wasn't disappointed.  We ordered Paella de Mariscos (seafood Paella) - I suggest you order it once you arrive since it takes up to 45 minutes.  There are plenty of seafood and we ended up eating only half. It was delicious.  While waiting for the paella to cook, we ordered side dishes like skirt steak, grilled octopus and pork ribs.  They were all yummy.

The restaurant has a great Spanish inspired ambiance.  Service is great. The manager is very friendly.  I recommend you to try this restaurant at least once but better call for reservation to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Kudos to bringing the tapas experience to Markham, but maybe I have high standards when it comes to it since have had it on numerous occasions in Spain, ...I can only give it 2.5 stars.  Over priced, average food, not inspired or feel it was tastefully memorable to go back.  It you want a non-Asian dining experience in Markham, I guess this could be an option - a one timer for us though.  Great service, very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday on a Saturday night and they offered us a nice private dinning room just enough for a party of 25.

Although it was only around 7:30, their bar was completely full and we were offered to sit right in front of their open concept kitchen. 

Service was decent. No complains but nothing over the top either. 

Highly recommend the seared foie gras and the 32 oz rib eye.. both dishes were amazing. 

Would definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"Tapagria is a trendy, upscale Spanish tapas bar, and it's a shame that that's all its got.

Atmosphere
*Clean and trendy decor
*Warm and cozy
*Booth seats were very comfortable
*Open concept kitchen without the open concept smells
*Bonus: They had mouthwash and hand cream in the washrooms

Service
*Friendly and knowledgeable
*Was ignored for most of the night

Food
*Portions were small, as expected, but was left wanting
*Food was bland. For a Spanish place, we expected more flavors
*Most dishes were drenched in oil/butter, yet somehow not seasoned?
*Spanish dessert toast was very good, but was very pricey ($10!)
*Drinks seemed good, but again, pricey. They all seemed very interesting though ($10-$13 per cocktail)

We were seated promptly and were offered multiple seating locations. We picked the booth option, and was told there will be a party of 25 next to us. Regardless, we went with the booth anyway as it looked the coziest. 

We ordered scallop ceviche, grilled calamari, fried pig ears, bone marrow, and escargot.

Our food was served promptly. They were hot, but were extremely oily and bland especially the fried pig ears. The bone marrow and escargot were delicious, but again, they were drenched in butter. It was a shame because we couldn't taste the bone marrow flavor without a mouthful of oil. 

The highlight of the night was the scallop ceviche - a clean and refreshing cold tapa, served with slightly spicy taro chips.

Our grilled calamari was bland and burnt. The majority of flavors came out from the slice of lemon.

Unfortunately, service ended after we ordered.

Perhaps due to the large table next to us, or perhaps of the servers' negligence, we had next to zero service the entire night. 

Our original server only came by twice the entire night. The first time, more than halfway through dinner service, he asked if anyone came to see us.. We responded that he was the first of the night. He profusely apologized, and never returned to our table again until he came with our bill.

That was the second time.

Our bill was not worth the $100 we paid. The service was extremely poor and the food was average at best. Unfortunately, we won't be back for a second round."}
{"text":"Decor is pretty nice. Happy to see a downtown type vibe finally located uptown. Definitely get a good Latin ambience when entering the restaurant. 

Food: delicious and appreciate some the unique dishes they have on their menu. Tried the steak and it was very tasty 

Service: aside from having our original seats given away to another party Bc they don't listen attentively, our server was amazing. He made the experience worth it and was knowledgeable about diff Flavors that work well with different dish and drink pairings 

Price: a bit high for a restaurant located in Richmond Hill. Steak was kinda expensive but I guess being the only option is this area for this type of cuisine you expect to pay a small premium 

Would I go back ? - yes"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Super friendly and helpful staff! Went for a dinner with group of 12 people and got a private room. Lots of space, and very nicely decorated! The service was amazing, servers came and checked up on us every so often to make sure our tables was cleaned and drinks were refilled. Loveeeee the tropical sangria! A must have when youre there!! 

My favourite dishes were the Roasted Bone Marrow, Pulpo (Grill octopus), Paella De Tapagria, and Jamon wrapped Dates. I love how most of their main dishes were comp'd with bitter veggies giving the whole dish a well balance of taste and flavours! Cant forget about their desserts as well. The churros and bread pudding was the cherry on top of an excellent dinner. Although the price point is a little high, but I really think it was worth every penny and every dish held up to the price. 

Highly recommend this place and will definitely go again! very soon too!"}
{"text":"This place was so nice, loved the decor, excellent customer service and well educated staff. Food and drinks were amazing. 
Only down side is that it's slightly on the more expensive side. This could be more reasonable if the meal is shared with multiple people. 
We walked out with leftover paella. 
Would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes and was very excited to try this new tapas restaurant in my area called Tapagria. My wife and I have been to numerous tapas restaurants in the GTA (Bar Isabel, Patria, Carmen and Tapas at Embrujo) as well as in New York (Soccarat) and in Barcelona, Spain. Needless to say we know what to expect.

We wanted to try the Paella and knew that it had to be ordered immediately as it would take roughly 45 to 50 minutes to cook. We ordered the Paella and a pitcher of Sangria immediately and asked the waitress to come back to take the small plate orders.

We ordered four small plates in addition to the Paella. The evening started out promising. The small plates we ordered came quickly and were very well done and tasty. The pitcher of grapefruit sangria was also very good.

Then the wheels started to fall off. We waited 45 minutes for the Paella but it had not yet arrived yet we noticed a large table behind us who came in later than us got a paella delivered to them. I immediately thought that our order had been given to them and around 10 minutes later the General Manager came over and confirmed my suspicions. He apologized and asked if he could comp us some other small plate as we waited and told us another Paella would be delivered in the next 10 minutes. We declined and stated we would just wait another 10 minutes for our Paella. The Paella arrived 5 minutes later ....... but the bomba rice in it was under cooked! We sent it back and the waitress asked if we would like it cooked some more or would like something else. I just asked her to take the Paella off the bill and charge us for what we had eaten up to that point. After waiting 50 minutes already for the Paella we were not in the mood to order another dish and wait for it. The waitress did state that they felt bad and wanted to comp us dessert and suggest the Spanish Toast. We accepted. You would think that after this experience we would at a minimum receive two desserts. Well think again .... they brought two spoons and one dessert ($8.00).

The General Manager came by again and apologized again trying to insinuate that the rice was not under cooked and it might be the crispy bottom of the Paella (this is known as soccarat). I then mentioned that i do know what soccarat is and that I also know when rice is under cooked. Rice is not supposed to be hard or dense in the centre and hello I am Chinese and know rice! I then stated it was pretty poor that they only comped one dessert for two people. He replied that they did provide two spoons. Whaaaaaat!!!!!!!!

I paid and asked to speak with the owner. He didn't provide much better customer service or explanations. Again he stated that they had tasted the rice and it was to their standard. He also stated that they did ask if we wanted something else which we declined. He stated that he only gave us one dessert because we did not what to order anything else and just wanted the bill originally. So I asked if they comp dessert for two people are they only provided one to share! I then asked if we had ordered two different desserts would we have had to pay for one of them. His response was that he would have taken it into consideration.

Now I am not so concerned about the damn dessert and the cost but as a customer it is very important to me as to how you treat me as a customer and what lengths you will go to correct a mistake or do the right thing! Do not treat me as if I do not know what I am talking about.

What ever happen to the saying, The customer is always right!

Sorry not at Tapagria!"}
{"text":"Over priced , small potion., not so wow food , overall experience  is 4.5/10 .
Overrated , Chinese operated Spanish restaurant not authentic."}
{"text":"Spanish tapas with a nice bar menu, fruity for lightweights.

Skirt steak - 8$
Bone Marrow - 18$
Escargot - 12$
Jamon wrapped dates - 10$
Paella Tapagria -45$
drinks 8-12

Skirt steak was mediocre at best, served on a tiny plate, carving was horrible, left it looking mangled, a really bad slicing job.

Bone marrow was pretty good, ask for salt on side, you might need it for the iron/fat tasting bits below the broiled surface area that was seasoned. Two huge pieces served with bread, but ask for more because it's definitely not enough to savour with all the marrow.

Escargot was deshelled stuffed in button mushrooms. 6 pieces an order. was okay.

Jamon wrapped dates, the favorite out of everything, cured ham wrapped sweet dates. A very nice balance for sweet and savoury. I would think for the price, 6 pcs would make sense rather then the 4 it came with. 

Paella was good for the size and price. a nice warm dish. It said it takes 45 minutes to come out for the flavours to blend... the flavours didn't wow me however. Regular seafood rice, good seasoning, nothing special tho. perhaps a different paella next time.

Overall 4/5 for effort, 3/5 for food."}
{"text":"Great design and great staff but....
I love a Spanish tapas restaurant and also $5 deal for the drink on Thu.
we ordered
-Mussles $7-really tasty with perfect portion.
-Skirt steak $8-was ok
-seared foir gras $22- small portion but really nice sauce on it.
I loved the sauce and small pc of mango in there!! the best dish,
-PAELLA DE TAPAGRIA $45-Disappointed so bad!! we never leave the food but could not deal with it.....undercooked seafood with over cooked sausage with sticky rice....OH MY.

Don't get me wrong, Place and staff was an amazing.i would love to give 5for that,but just food was soooooooo nasty...sorry"}
{"text":"4.5/5 

Came to this place twice (once for dinner takeout and once for brunch dine-in).

This place really is a gem considering that it's not downtown core. 

The decor is pleasant and not pretentious. Service is okay. That being said I am rating this place purely for quality of food and quality of food only. 

For dinner take out we had paella de mariscos and some fried pork belly. Both were absolutely delicious. Paella had lots of seafood (although I wish it had a little more lobster, it only had like 4 small pieces). Paella takes 45 minutes to cook, so make sure to order it early if you are dining in. The paella has amazing flavor that you'll struggle to find anywhere else in Toronto. Fried pork belly is like putting heaven in your mouth. Here I have to make a note about the price, even though this place is supposed to be $$ it really is $$$. My girlfriend and I finished the paella and pork belly for dinner, and were pleasantly full. At 35 dollars a person this may not be 'moderate' for some, however given the quality of food I think it is totally justified. 

When we stopped for brunch we ordered some jamon iberico to start. For people that are skeptical this jamon is the real deal. It melts in your mouth and is a definite treat. We, then had some chicken & waffles and a porchetta. Chicken and waffles dish was very good however the chicken pieces had a few bones in them (so that may not be for everyone's liking); there are definitely other places in the city that have good chicken and waffles. The porchetta,on the other hand, was absolutely excellent and is by far the best way to have pork (aside from the fried pork belly tapa dish above). The fresh kale salad that comes with porchetta really gives the dish a good contrast and absolutely wonderful flavor. 

For drinks we had a pitcher of guava pear sangria and it, again, was probably the best sangria you can have north of 401. The sangria really had \"homemade\" feel to it, with whole strawberries and pieces of lime floating in the pitcher. 

Finally for desert we've had their signature \"Spanish toast\". I am not going to go into the pains of describing what Spanish toast actually is. I'll just say it was one of the best desert's I have ever had. If you are debating about trying this place out, I highly recommend to try it out just for this desert. And I am not even a desert person. 

I've been to Spain and I think the food at Tapagria comes closest to showcasing real Spanish flavors. Considering that this place is in Markham  it is an absolute gem for everyone living north of 401. People will nitpick and rate this place for their decor, seating and service (all of which are okay); however if you want to experience some spectacular flavors and some really good Spanish food you will not find a better place in GTA. So food alone get's this 5/5 for me. I am only giving this place 4.5/5 because the food can seem a little pricey (although I can't reiterate enough that you will get what you are paying for)."}
{"text":"menu says peala about 45min, and i wait about 70min and taste not that good, slowest restaurant i ever been, ham was too tinny."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend the paellas, it was really great. However, we were not so satisfied with the lunch menu, very limited options. It was really quiet for a Saturday, and it doesn't seem like people were excited to be there. 

The hot tapas, I had the chance to try many of them. First off, the grilled octopus and grilled steak was great, skirt steak was a little bit too oily for us. The clams were also quite good. Fried anchovies was beyond salty, considering it was anchovies, we let it pass. Bone marrow felt like a rip off, seared foie grais was a bit disappointing as well. 

The service was great as well, but we never heard a self introduction, no clue what his name was. But very bright and helpful."}
{"text":"I recently heard about this place and was really excited to try it because they had squid ink paella, which was AMAZING! I feel like this restaurant belongs on King West, it's rare finding a restaurant like this uptown. It's a little on the pricy side considering the portions but all in all everything we ordered was delicious. 

If you're not scared of some black rice I would definitely recommend the squid ink paella, it does take 45 minutes or so to cook so I wouldn't order too many other tapas as by the time our paella got to us we were pretty full and were only able to finish half of it. 

We also ordered Spanish meatballs, Spanish fries, grilled calamari and truffle croquetas. All very delicious but again I would probably order less next time. They have a variety of different sangrias, we tried pineapple mint - it was so good!

I would definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"The seafood paella and squid ink pasta were alright."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the high rating of this place. The restaurant itself was beautiful, but the service and food let me down. We ordered 2 tapas, 1 jamon, and 1 paella. The skirt steak was quite good for the price, it was a bit chewy though. Grilled octopus and jamon were okay, nothing too special. The paella was quite disappointing, it was so small that I thought they gave us the wrong dish when it came. I also do not recommend ordering this $52 paella (order the cheaper one if you really want paella), we ordered it because it was said to have lobster in it, it turned out there were only 2 small pieces of lobster. In terms of service, I have to say it was quite disappointing. As we were not very familiar with Spanish dishes, it took us some time to decide what to order, but the waitress kept giving us pressure to order although the restaurant was quite empty at the time. The way she talked to us, I'm not sure whether or not she was trying too hard to be funny, but I found her attitude quite sarcastic and impolite."}
{"text":"The food is fine, quality wise is at the same level compares to other Spanish restaurants. Well think it's over priced for the portion they give you. And cocktail is also pricy compared to elsewhere in general. Three of us paid $140 up and honestly we're not really full walking out of this place. Will not go again, there're many better options for Spanish restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Firstly, $5 sangrias on Thursdays! Hits were the seared foie gras, octopus salad and bone marrow (despite oily). Misses were the mussels and mushroom croquetas. Price does rack up if you order a lot of tapas since portions are small..

{"text":"Came here with a group of friends to try some Spanish tapas.  Overall, the decor and atmosphere was great.  Some food items were worth getting and yummy but others were a huge disappointment so it was a hit and miss for me.

Food: 
Ordered the following items: 
1. Paella De Tapagria- The paella is great value and taste.  It was $45 and a good portion size.  The flavour was good and texture of the rice was just right.  I would highly recommend it.  
2. Foie Gras Pate- $10 for 2 pieces.  It was okay but for that price, nothing remarkable that would make me want to order it again.  
3. Kale and Cauliflower- Decent price for this salad appetizer.  
4. Spanish meatballs- Taste and texture good and decent price. 
5. Octopus leg- This was the biggest disappointment of the evening.  I expected an actual leg.  It was basically 8 super tiny pieces fr $15.  It looked like leftovers (See pic) and nothing special.  
6. Grilled calamari- This was a good dish to order recommended by our waitress.  Decent portion and good price and made perfectly.  
7. Skirt steak- Pretty good but nothing special about it.  
8. Double bone marrow- $18 for 2 large bones and bread to go with it.  Pretty good and worth getting.  
9. Spanish toast dessert- Recommended by our waitress and it was a good deal.  It's worth trying and is a great end to a meal.  

Decor: 
Comfortable environment and seating with high ceilings.  Atmosphere is nice and they'll let you sit the whole evening without rushing you.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"As we are running late and knowing all the restaurant in Markham close their kitchen earlier than usual, we called in ahead and make sure that the kitchen is not close. Which the guy said it closes 9:30 pm. As we come in , and sat down and order they told us that kitchen for their pallea closed and to order only tapas. 
I just wish we didn't wasted our time coming here if they inform us ahead of time that everything else is fine except pallea. Instead of owning up to their mistake, they instead choose to ask us to order from their expensive tapas menu. I don't mind their tapas but I have been to a lot of restaurants in Toronto and Markham. Most of them will own up to their mistake and offer Some sorta compromise. Eg free dish. But no. We were forced to order the tapas only. Guess what., we are not going to. They chose to lose a customer instead. Very surprise. It would have been 100+ order if we ate there. But seem like their manager didn't care maybbe they are making $$$ that they don't need more customers. I wonder if the owner knows or is the owner choosing to do things this way and choosing to lose customer and choosing to give that level of customer service. 

In term of food and quality , Food are very pricy and their tapas are such tiny portions (I get it. Tapas are suppose to be tiny but come on I am paying 8 dollar per dish. Please treat me with some level of customer service  at least ) . Very disappointed. 

Food quality is not bad last time I came but I won't say it's top of the line. 

The manager was the one who told us to come in and later on told us that the pallea is not available and didn't have the Courtesy to come and tell himself. I don't think it is right for him to tell us to come in and later on when we wasted our time told us that we can only order those over price tapas. Ridiculous! At least there's many other options in the plaza."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night after work with a friend. They seated us at a HUGE table even though there were only the two of us. We were interested in getting the Paella (the one with seafood and chorizo and other things in it, I forgot what the name of it was called). But we found out that they had a Monday special! It was a pitcher of sangria + paella for $40!!!! It was a steal because the Paella itself usually costs $45, and a pitcher of sangria usually is somewhere around $30. So we got that and a few other tapas. I really wanted to try to Kale & Cauliflower Salad, and I kid you not, it was the BEST thing I have eaten that day. I absolutely loved it!! We also got something else too (I forgot what we got), but I remember it to be quite delicious. The Paella takes 45 minutes to cook, so we had a bit of time in between the tapas and the paella. It was quite nice to have that pitcher of Sangria with us. The Paella was a fairly large amount when it finally arrived and it was piping hot! It was delicious and very hard for two people to finish it.

Overall, amazing service and good food :)"}
{"text":"Yay to tapas in Markham! This is a much welcome change to the sudden influx of ramen places in this area. Instead of having to commute to downtown for some of my favourite foods, it's located close by at where the old go4tea used to be. 

The server that our party of 3 had for the evening was one of the sweetest girls ever! She was attentive but not overbearing and gave us great recommendations for food and drinks. 

Drinks: 
I had the Apparent Sour which is an excellent balance of citrus and not as sour as the name implied. My girlfriend had a gin and tonic that 2 out of the 3 of us enjoyed. Note on the drinks: tasted a bit light on the alchy because even the lightweight in me didn't walk out with a buzz

Food:

Meat platter $16
Great for sharing amongst 3 people. There were 4-5 slices of 4 variations of cured meats which came with figs, onions, and mustard. 

Roasted bone marrow
We opted for the option to double up for an extra $4. I've always enjoyed bone marrow but I found this one to be on the salty side. 

Grilled skirt steak
Grilled well, good spices, but underwhelming 

Scallops! 
This was one of the specials of the day and came highly recommended by our server. She was completely right! This was the best dish of the night grilled to perfection and paired with a buttery sauce and some greens. 

Jamon wrapped dates
Surprisingly good and excellent combination of flavours and texture

Paella de tapagria
Order this first because it does take 45 minutes to cook. I'm not an expert an paella at all but I found it a bit oily for my own personal preference. Taste was great and I enjoyed the chorizo. 

Desserts!
We had the Spanish toast and churros. Sooo yummy. Spanish toast over the churros. My only regret was that we didn't save more room for their secret menu item the tapagria mega dessert platter $30. 

The atmosphere here is rustic and comfortable, fantastic venue to have some fantastic food with some fantastic people."}
{"text":"After spending a week in Barcelona, I've was quite exciting to read all the good reviews about this restaurant and decided to give it a try.  While this might be an ok addition to the area for some Spanish tapas, if you are hoping to experience some authentic Spanish cuisine then this place is a major let down.  

Our table of 8 tried a variety of dishes from the soggy Paella, bitter smoked eggplant, overly salty mushroom pintxo, sardinas with way too much breading, tough kale cauliflower salad, overly dry spanish meatballs, and the boring patatas bravas and churros dessert.  

Only semi decent dishes were the whole octopus, and the spanish toast dessert was good, as well as the traditional sangria.

To top it off, our waitress Sarah was in a rush all night for some reason and spilled various items on our table, on a early Sunday night when the restaurant wasn't even fully busy.  Overall very disappointed with the experience, we won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ok...wow.  Just wow.  From the foie gras to the pork belly to the great oysters and the fantastic ham selection, you need to check this place out.
One look at the menu and you know they get paella...if that's your plan, order it first.  It takes 45mins so the flavors \"can blend\".  No scoop of stuff thrown on top of rice here.
I  make paella because it's so rare to find a place that can make it correctly.
In short?...eat here...over and over and over."}
{"text":"Cold mediocre food complimented by very bad service.  
We waited about 30 mins for our appetizers, and another 20mins for desserts. Overall was not satisfied with food and service quality."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, and almost all the tables were packed with couples. Which is understandable, given the pretty/chic ambience and attentive service, it's a pretty ideal date spot. Especially unexpected in Markham/Richmond Hill; though the prices reflect the exclusivity of the venue (ie: you'd be paying the same prices for tapas in downtown Toronto). 

Arguably, the food is pretty good though. Had the jamon wrapped dates (not my favourite, but a favourite of my mom & bro), foie gras pate pintxos, double bone marrow and the Mariscos/seafood paella. 

My pick for the night would probably be the foie pate pintxos, a creamy and generous dollop of pate on two small slices of baguette toast. 

I'd say skippable was the double bone marrow. Though tasty, it's not a lot of marrow once you've scraped it out of the two luge bones. 

The paella was fragrant and brought out the seafood flavours without fishy tastes, but I think I could've opted for a more basic paella without missing too much. 

A couple tips:
- The apps will come out almost immediately; if you plan on getting paella I recommend putting in the order first, then go through the menu again at your leisure and order the apps & pintxos. Otherwise you'll have a pretty large gap between the courses
- One paella will feed about 3 adults (if you also add 1-2 small plates per person)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday around 7 pm, and we were suprised to see that the restaurant was fairly empty. Got a table easily for a family of 8, which was a big bonus. 

We tried quite a variety of things as most of their dishes were meant to be shared (tapas). 

The Cornish hen was seasoned to perfection! Perfect amount of lemon and pepper, making the skin absolutely delicious. It was slightly over cooked, but the flavors were just on point. 

The paella takes 45 minutes to make, so I definitely recommend ordering it as soon as you sit down. It tasted very authentic, as the seafood and chorizo really infused into the al dente rice. It wasn't over greasy either which made it even better! 

Overall, had a great time here. Great service, good food. Only reason why it isn't a 5/5 is because some of vegetables on the sides were charred and bitter, and the meat board had too much olive oil over the cured meats."}
{"text":"Top picks: venison capaccio, grilled skirt steak and the churros. Gold prize goes to the smoked eggplant! It had so many wonderful punches of flavour in every bite! My top picks all had moments of \"oh wow that's a nice surprise!\" In every bite! 

Everything all in all tasted great but the above were definitely standouts! 

Only thing to look out for is to dress in your warm sweaters/tights/warm dresses if you're sitting close to the door. When the door opens and the gust of wind and cold sneak in you definitely feel the draft. Otherwise, the ambiance was great and so was their featured red wine and beer. I would probably come back here and try their paellas :)"}
{"text":"I found this place when I was looking for places to eat near my work place, but since they open at 5pm, I was looking for the right occasion to make a trip. I suggested it when we were going for dinner and drinks with co-workers since we were looking for a new place to try and somewhere with a patio. Tapagria fit the bill. The patio gets full points - secluded from the parking lot with a plant wall. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share - best way to do it since it's Tapas-style and you get to try more food this way. Everything we had was delicious and I highly reccomend it all: Sangria pitcher(Peach and Basil, but with the wide variety, I'm sure the others are good too), Kale Cauliflower salad, Salt Cod Croquetas, Jamon wrapped dates, the paella de Tapagria (order this when you arrive, it takes about 30 mins) and OMG you have to save room for dessert - that Spanish toast is heavenly!! We also got the churros which was meh. Also - it's buck-a-shuck Tuesdays with the purchase of a drink. So yay for oysters! We were 4 of us, and the bill came to $160 for all the above. It's on the pricier side, yes, but worth it for a special occasion. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with delicious food and drinks! I went here with a lady friend for dinner on a Saturday night. Made reservations through open table just to be safe but was not necessary. We had the Mango mint Sangria pitcher which was excellent. We tried the Tapagria Paella and the bone  marrow. The Paella is easily large enough for 2-3 people, not sure why I'm reading posts with people complaining about the size. There was plenty of seafood and it was quite delicious . The bone marrow is not for everyone. You get 3 large bones which we both shared and enjoyed. It is on the salty side but I would definitely have it again! Our waiter was excellent, his support staff could have been better but will not take away stars for that. The Latin music and the atmosphere is awesome too, there were times we wished they had a dance floor! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Chinese-run Spanish restaurant isn't authentic for my enjoyment.  The fries were amazing but the 7 other dishes were nothing special.  Bone marrow was ok but nothing special, both pasta dishes were too salty. Meh."}
{"text":"Genuinely surprised by this place. It's a lot more spacious than I initially thought and the atmosphere is very lively and comfortable. Some of the tables near the middle are a bit too close together for my comfort, but otherwise a great setup. 

I was expecting the menu to consists of more items, but it  seems like I was ordering almost everything as there are limited choices. To their credit, they did have chef specials which were not on the menu. The staff were quite friendly and offered a few items which were off the menu. 

Had a chance to try out their bone marrow here and I must say it was my favourite part of the meal. It was very soft and flavourful. This needs to be a part of their permanent menu!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim after reading about Tuesday $1 oysters. 

Great ambiance, very cool place. Attentive staff. 

Ordered glasses of Chardonnay which was a great pairing with our food, which was so good. 

Oysters for $1 , although just Malpaques were amazingly fresh , served  with lemon and Tabasco. Just they way we like  them.  Also had the grilled octopus, warmed olives, steamed mussels and sardines. Ended the meal with churros with chocolate hazelnut.  

Wow, what a meal. Totally unexpected for a strip mall in Markam. Far better than most of the high end Tapas places in downtown T.O.  And most importantly, reasonable prices and didn't have to make a reservation 3 months ahead of time. 

Visit this place, you will not be disappointed. 

I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of a kind in Markham!

The service is really good. Kind, knowledgeable service in a bustling, massive restaurant space. When you walk in, you immediately smell the delicious aroma of roasting meat, garlic, etc. And it really opens up the appetite!

Highlights include their jambon de iberico which utilizes pigs fed a special diet of acorns, creating a nuttier flavour in the fat of the ham, as well as their juicy yet tender calamari (Not rubbery or chewy at all, but still great smoky char and squid flavour). Their double bone marrow is worth a mention with its buttery savoury flavour! 

Their big plates are more expensive, but their pork chop is succulently fat and moist. Worth a shot! The next time I go, I'm going to try their ribeye and their paella! Be warned though, these are big, rich meals, so bring friends to try more things. 

PS - Their dessert, the Spanish toast, is a must try! Brioche bun is soaked in custard overnight and then the result is creme-bruled. Decadence, creaminess, and sweetness all in one! One of the best desserts I've had in recent memory."}
{"text":"Dinner with work cohort, staying across the street at Sheraton. Convinced colleagues there's other dining options near the hotel as I wasn't eating at the hotel restaurant. Atmosphere was friendly. Wine and drinks selection pretty good . Ordered paella first as at takes 45mins to make. Started off with tapas, grilled calamari was tender and delicious. This you must try. The grilled octopus was ok, would rather have ordered two calamari instead. Ordered two other tapas that were not memorable. Paella arrived was tasty but length to wait is long. Expect to be here for a long meal. Food was good and fun if more than 4 people dining to order more tapas to share. We skipped dessert given length of meal and walked back to our hotel."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place! Offers something a little different for this area. We were a group of 5 and came in on a Saturday. We ordered the set dinner for 3-4 people and then also ordered the roasted bone marrow and shrimp since the set said served 3-4, we were worried it wouldn't be enough. Big mistake, it was so much food we really didn't need to order extras. We really liked most of the dishes, especially the fries and the paella. Everything was well seasoned and fresh. The bone marrow to me was a bit disappointing though, wasn't anything special. There also didn't seem to be a set server for our table at first and some of the servers were more helpful then others. I actually thought the price was super reasonable for the amount of food you get. I do recommend coming as a bigger group though. Worth a try and I would definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"I was at Tapagria with a group of 20 on Saturday to continue my birthday celebration through the weekend. I picked it because it's easy to get to by car if you live around North York and Richmond Hill area, which most of my close friends do.

When you first walk in you notice the open space, high ceilings, with a rustic Spanish look to it. We sat in the party room, which felt more private and intimate. 

Since most of my friends are couples, everyone shared their tapas with their significant other. I personally shared the West Coast Oysters and the Tapagria Paella with my boyfriend. Both were very good, but I wish the Paella was hot. It takes 40 minutes to prepare so if you want to get it, tell your waiter about it right when you order your drinks! My boyfriend enjoyed his Spanish beer (Estrella) so much that he ordered two. I also shared a traditional sangria, and churros with chocolate sauce with a friend. Definitely try the dolce de leche sauce instead of the chocolate! I enjoyed that sauce way more.

Our waitress was very stressed out, angry, and overwhelmed. When we asked her if everything was OK, she said that she was \"pissed off\" that the restaurant had no heating. Which was true, 'cause if I didn't have alcohol in my system, I would have been very cold myself. I gave my cardigan to a friend because she was shivering. In the washroom, I did appreciate them leaving mouthwash for customers to use, but their toilet paper on the other hand, was not accessible. It was stuck, and you can tell other people had the same problem, because of all the small pieces that were teared off on the floor. So I literally had to come out of the stall and grab paper towel instead. Not a great feeling.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience with all my friends, but there were a few things that can be improved for future customers."}
{"text":"You don't have to ask me twice if I want to go out for tapas. Small plates and multiple orders? Count me in! I love trying new food and going out for tapas with a group of friends is the perfect way to try a little of everything!

Tapagria has a great atmosphere and the service is friendly. You can book a reservation through Open Table which is always a plus.

Here's what we ordered in order from my most favourite to my least favourite:

1. ROASTED BONE MARROW- I'm a little biased on this one as I LOVE bone marrow. I only wish there was more of it! It was the perfect texture and saltiness. Goes great with the warm toasted bread.

2. TUNA TARTARE AND LOTUS CHIPS- Omg I am so glad that I added this to my order last minute. The tuna is so fresh and deliciously seasoned, and the lotus chips are nice and crisp. This is definitely a must-order if I am to come here again. They give a generous portion of tuna tartare on each chip, and there's about 8 chips. 

3. TRUFFLE FRIES- Wow these were a lot better than I expected. The truffle flavour is STRONG, so you better like truffle! I mostly ordered these cause fries are typically more filling and it's a cheap way to get full faster haha. But these were actually really good, and I would highly recommend. 

4. ROMESCO SKIRT STEAK- The romesco sauce was good and the portion was not too small, and it's a good option if you want some meat. The steak was cooked exactly as we asked.

5. CALAMARI FRITO- I've actually had a lot better calamari at other places, but this one was not too bad. I don't think I would order this again though, as it was nothing special.

6. MARINATED OCTOPUS- this was a cold dish, and the flavours were good. It also came with two pieces of warm toasted bread. 

7. JUMBO GARLIC PRAWNS- one of the pricier tapa dishes, and I wouldn't really call it a small plate as the prawns were huge and there was a generous amount of them. I didn't really get to taste the garlic as my boyfriend peeled the prawns for me, and all the sauce is on the shell. However he said the sauce was good.

8. FOIE GRAS PATE ON TOAST- Ummm... this dish was really confusing. It was not the traditional foie gras that I'm used to. This one a bowl filled with crumbly pieces that went through a food processer. It felt like someone chewed it and spit it back out. It was also a lot sweeter than I expected.

OVERALL, Tapagria is a great restaurant, especially with a group as you get to try a lot of different dishes. I would come back"}
{"text":"In general, the food was tasty, but very pricy. I understand that it is normal for Spanish tapas to be expensive and small in portion, but I felt that they are exceptionally small. We ordered the roasted bone marrow and the amount was so small it was barely enough to spread even on one small toast and costed $12! All dishes were pitifully small. 

The paella was most disappointing. The dish claimed to have lobster but that was nowhere to be found. The shrimps were mushy in texture. Saffron threads were nowhere to be seen. The mussel shells were barely open and the squid tasted a bit raw. The rice was crunchy (more crunchy than al dente). The dish cost $52 and was highly recommended by the server!! We told the waiter this and the manager was very understanding and had comp us with 3 other dishes, which we were happy about. However, to charge this kind of price, I'd expect a much higher quality and a lot less room for error. 

All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant. If you want to spend this kind of money, you can try Patria."}
{"text":"Great new place in Markham!

I love the decor, open kitchen and it's nice and spacious, being able to handle large groups.

They meat and cheese platters are great (if you have to choose one, go with the meat). Only thing I didn't like that was ordered was the Spanish meatballs- but salt cod croquettes were great.

If anything go for the Spanish toast -it's amazing. I would go there just to have that for dessert"}
{"text":"Very tasty tapas.  Love the angus tartare loaded with truffle oil.  

Ordered both paella and a little disappointed that one of them is not fully cooked.  Both paella have lots of seafood and the taste is there, but since they are cooked in a deep skillet, it is really hard to have a well cook paella.  

Love the atmosphere and the decor. Very friendly servers and attentive floor managers.  With a restaurant that only opens for 4 days, services are excellent and for sure they will improve on their food."}
{"text":"Location/Service
Along Highway 7, corner lot of the plaza on Commerce Valley. Lots of parking available although the plaza itself is relatively busy. 
Decor inside is modern and bright, lots of seating available and perfect for groups. 
Service was okay, the waiter weren't too responsive at times and a bit of a wait for certain small requests. 

Food
This restaurant specializes in tapas and paella, all of which are really good to share amongst groups. Pricing is a little high, so if you order a few items it can add up. 
For paella, we had the Paella De Mariscos. I like the variety of seafood (lobster, shrimp, octopus). It has a little bit of spice, but not overwhelming. Portion of seafood matched well for its size and rice was nicely cooked. 
Tapas/Appetizers include oysters, which were a little off that day. Spanish fries were good and not oily. Spicy octopus were spicy and saucy. Tuna tartare was okay, the sauce mixed was a little weird. Pintxo Trio was alright too, likes the variety to change up the palette. 
Dessert was churros, which was made to perfection. The dolce du leche was a little too much though and sweet to my tasting. 

Overall this place is nice for a big group, especially when you order sangria to share and meet up. Food is a hit or miss on a few items."}
{"text":"Food very expensive and very small portions. Our rude waitress was VERY pushy trying to make us order extra food and drinks, when we said \"no thank you\" many times throughout the night (mind you we ordered several dishes to start off with). The food tasted very average, nothing special at all. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Sometimes, when you eat out a lot like I do (like many of us do) meals start to blend together, one thing tastes like another, one restaurant gets confused with another, it all becomes a blur. I must admit I've sort of been in this funk lately thinking \"Oh great another gastro-pub duck infused, blah blah blah\" - I'm FAT OK!!

Then yesterday happened, I've read the reviews, re-grammed, and tweeted about Tapagria (the fusion of Spanish Tapas and Sangria - get it), but then I visited... and wow. Hello suburbs? Yes, it's downtown big city dining with big city flavours - north of hwy 401 for once!

Walking into Tapagria the space is huge and incredibly well designed merging together classical elements, custom design pieces and a little flair for industrial design with exposed brick, metal work and wood elements. A massive dining room, two private dining rooms, a wrap around kitchen for hot tapas prep, a private bar area and another kitchen for colder tapas prep. There is something to watch in every corner of this place.

Took a seat at a booth and was going to go in on a Sangria but realized the price was for pitchers (I'm ambitious with my booze, just not when driving) so instead I reviewed the menu and saw they had a bolded Cocktail menu and right at the top and Old fashioned. Good lord! Could it be so? It was.. it was! A maple infused old fashioned perfectly balanced so as to not be too alcohol forward, too sweet or too bitter. 

Best Old Fashioned in Markham - you read it right here folks.

I was starved by the end of the drink and decided it was time to order some eats. Lesson learned never do Tapas alone... you order too much, feel bad, try to eat it all, enjoy every bite, go home and want to die. But die happy non-the-less! Here is each item I ordered and my thoughts on each.

COLD TAPAS

KALE CAULIFLOWER SALAD  w/ truffle oil $4. Really enjoyed how fresh this dish was, the kale was perfectly prepared and softned, and the cauliflower was actually enjoyable (I normally dislike that veg). My only personal pref was a little less truffle oil but when can you really have too much. Generous portion for the price - dish finished 4.5/5

PINTXOS (think of these as a Spanish version of bruschetta except with different toppings on the bread. 2 pieces/order)

SMOKED EGGPLANT sour cream, tomato $5. You could taste the smoke in this, perfect in every way. A MUST HAVE - dish finished 5/5
FOIE GRAS PÂTÉ served w/ truffle oil, mango $10. Extremely rich but also the marriage of the mango sweetness and the richness of the foie was amazing - dish finished 5/5
ANGUS TARTARE angus tenderloin, truffle $10. A healthy heaping portion of Angus beef tartar atop the bread. Beautifully seasoned, clean finish. dish finished 5/5

NOTE: Some might argue the higher price of the Foie and Angus but I implore you to remember these are super premium ingredients and thus come with a premium price point. I felt compared to similar dishes in the city these were comparable in price but exceeded in quality and portion size.

HOT TAPAS

FRIED PORK BELLY $12, battered and fried. Wasn't my favourite dish, might have been due to the fact I was getting full. However, taste was good but just not my cup of tea - did not finish 3/5.

JAMÓN WRAPPED DATES $8. Sweet merciful crap this was like mini breakfast bites. Spice of the bacon like ham, with the sweetness from the date - almost maple syrup in flavour. Incredible - finished this (A MUST HAVE) 5/5

DOUBLE ROASTED BONE MARROW $18. Huge marrow bones, beautifully seasoned and expertly cooked with plenty of pure fat to spread across your waiting crostini bread. Pure gluttony here, finished and licked the bone when no one was looking 5/5 

DESSERT
(Yeah I had dessert too, don't you judge me... don't you dare judge me)

SPANISH TOAST, caramelized brioche, whipped cream, sweet custard, sweet milk. I don't know what I can say about this dish... amazing? Must have? I'm drooling while I think back on it? I'm normally not a dessert person but I would kill someone if they tried to touch my spanish toast? Yeah all of that. This is basically what happens if French Toast and English bread pudding go for a romantic weekend in the Spanish countryside... 2-3 days later this little baby arrives. Puts all other desserts to shame. End of story.

This was a without question my top dining experience of 2016 thus far. I know were only 1 month in but without question Tapagria is superior to all others. I've been doing this Yelp game for going on 5 years and when you come across somewhere special... you share it (just don't ask me to share my spanish toast or like tay-tay says - \"Now we got problems, And I don't think we can solve them, You made a really deep cut, And, baby, now we got bad blood\").

{"text":"Came here for a family gathering. The decor of the restaurant was very nice and fancy. I went with a big group so we were in the back with a private room.

I was very impressed with the service and food. We ordered a bunch of different things but here are the ones I remember :

Prime rib - delicious and tender. I would definitely get this again. 

Piri Piri chicken -  very crispy and tasty but I thought it was a bit on the salty side. 

Venison tartare - first time having vension. It was pretty decent. 

Selection of cured meats -  I was blown away, it was so  goood. 

Must have is the paella but make sure to order it first as it takes 45 min to prepare. It was full of flavour!

I'd definitely recommend this place for parties or dates. The food however is on the pricier side but I'd definitely go back for special occasions!"}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. Came here to celebrate my gf's birthday and booked a table for 5:30pm on march 12. Got here earlier at 5:15 and the doors were still closed. Called the restaurant 3 times and no one picked up. And they still didn't open at 5:30. We waited outside 15 mins. What a major disappointment. It's like they didn't want any business at all. Wanted to give this a try but I guess they didn't have good time management procedures...."}
{"text":"Had a girls night out here on a Monday night to catch up and we were pleasantly surprised by the decor inside - it was very welcoming and had a sort of romantic feel to it.

As this is a tapas place, we ordered a few tapas to share along with a paella. The Monday night special is $40 for half a pitcher of sangria and a paella de tapagria which we did order. Along with this we ordered other tapas to share while waiting for the paella. 

Salt Cod Croquetas - I thought these were well done with a nice crunch on the outside and it was not overly salty. 

Grilled Skirt Steak - this was well done but not as flavourful as we expected

Mussels - the mussels themselves did not soak as much of the flavour of the broth as we hoped but we also had bread on the side to dip into the leftover sauce which was enjoyable.

Paella de tapagria - this was much better than expected and quite heavy because of all the toppings included with the rice. 

Although the food was quite enjoyable, the service was really slow which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars. There were limited amounts of waiters and waitresses and the restaurant itself was not overbooked or packed. The AC was not very strong at all and it felt a little bit stuffy throughout the dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, great atmosphere, attentive and friendly staff. 
They were very accommodating since our group was quite large. 
Our server was great, she had all our orders (food, drinks) correct. 

My favourite dishes include: 
- kale cauliflower salad
- 32oz ribeye
- roasted bone marrow
- foie gras
- smoked eggplant

Pricing is on par with all the Tapa restaurants in Toronto. This is a great location for uptown folks and very accessible if you live downtown as it close to the 404. 

Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"great food, great service, great experience overall! a bit pricier, but worth checking out!"}
{"text":"When looking up a place to go with a fellow yelper, it gets a little tricky. It's gotta be somewhere you've both never been, interested in trying, and within a close proximity. That's how Amy Z. and I ended up coming to Tapagria. 

First off, the decor and ambiance inside was quite nice. A welcoming environment with friendly staff made it an enjoyable experience. I don't know much about tapas restaurants, so this was quite cool for me. 

The menu was a bit small, with only a couple things in each category. Their main selling points are their paella and some specific tapas. Amy and I decided to share, so we went for the Lobster Salad, Angus Tartare, Meat Plate, Steak Skirt, and Bone Marrow. 
The highlight of the food was definitely the Bone Marrow and Angus Tartare. Both were done quite well, and a good size portion. Everything else was good, but didn't quite blow my socks off. 

Service was great, as we went on a quieter night, so we had a few people catering to our table and needs. Not sure if its the same on busier nights though. 

Prices were a bit on the higher side in my opinion, considering I wasn't completely full after the meal.

Overall, a good night out, and may decide to come back for some paella another time. Maybe with a larger group though!"}
{"text":"We came with a large group of 20 for a birthday. It was perfectly set up for us at the two large high tables next to the kitchen. They split the bill the way we wanted and even provided plates and cutlery for the cake we brought at no extra charge!

Top Suggested Dishes: 
Foie Gras Pate - Very generous on the Foie Gras spread, large mount of pate, light truffle oil over fresh bread.
CHULETÓN ASADO - 32 oz Ribeye - The perfect steak, grilled medium rare and finely seasoned. 
Fried Anchovies - Lightly battered, deliciously seasoned fish rings with house made sauce.

They are also known for their Sangrias. A menu full of rare and unique mixes (if you're into that stuff)

Summary: Amazing atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. I could eat the Foie Gras Pate and 32oz Steak all day. The price is rated at $$$, which is in line with most Tapas restaurants in Toronto. Well worth it if you have a big group."}
{"text":"It was my first time at a Spanish restaurant, and although some of the tapas we ordered were mediocre, some of them were definitely worth it!

My friends and I came here on a Saturday at 7:30 p.m. - it was relatively busy, so I would recommend making a reservation beforehand. Between the three of us, we ordered five tapas:

(1) Tuna Tartare & Lotus Chips (Would Not Recommend)

Having never had tuna tartare before, I was pleasantly surprised with its delicate flavours. However, the lotus chip had such massive holes in them that it wasn't too great of a canvas to hold the tuna tartare. Also, the chips were excessively salted. 

(2) Garlic Mussels (Would Not Recommend) 

This was recommended by our waitress - I am a seafood lover, but the mussels in this dish were not only extremely small, but many of them were empty shells! The taste of the mussels themselves also exuded somewhat of a stench, making it somewhat unpleasant to eat. 

(3) Calamari Frito (Recommend)

This was probably the best dish of the night - the calamari were not only crisp, but perfectly cooked (ie. not overly chewy/overcooked). The sauce that came with it was also delicious, but the calamari on its own was already a great treat!

(4) Grilled Spanish Chorizo (Recommend)

Despite not being a meat lover (other than chicken and seafood), I am surprised to say that this dish was delicious! The smoked flavours from the chorizo coupled with the rich texture of the dish made it very satisfying to eat! 

(5) Chili Rapini (Recommend)

While this was considered a 'side dish' at the restaurant, it had the largest portion size. My friends and I found it necessary to pour all of the chili flakes onto the rapini, as the rapini itself lacked seasoning. Nevertheless, the combination of the chili peppers and rapini made this dish absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"An excellent choice for Spanish tapas in Richmond Hill! Having chosen one of the set dinners (for 5-6), we did find it wasn't quite enough and ordered two more tapas, but the selection was good. I was thoroughly impressed with the strip steak which was perfectly marinated and juicy. As well, the calamari was quite fresh and not overly fried! Notably, the paella was full of muscles and chicken, which were well seasoned, and the rice was cooked to the right texture. However, I was slightly disappointed with the white truffle fries, and the escargot. The fries were slightly dried and the truffle was very overrated, and the escargot came in an extremely small portion of the $9. Overall, the set menu featured a wide variety of quality tapas, definitiley worth trying!"}
{"text":"It's a worthwhile restaurant to try when you're in the mood for something that's NOT Asian food in the Markham / Richmond Hill area.   

Service: attentive and quick service, they have tons of staff walking around. 

Food:
Bone Marrow: delicious, double bone marrow with pieces of bread for you to savour the buttery goodness.  But be prepared to shell out $18 for this dish. 

Kale cauliflower salad: get your greens on with this delicious salad.  Lightly seasoned but tasty. 

Venison Carpaccio: well seasoned, with flavourful slices of venison.  

Meat Board: hmmm..... The mustards in my opinion didn't pair well with the Serrano meats.  The capers tasted too much like brine.   It seemed like they added a bit of oil to some of the meats.   I would not recommend this. 

Foie pate pinxtos: I think it was a nice attempt. But the truffle oil they used overpowered the taste of foie.   And for $5 a piece, I damn well better taste some foie!  

Spanish Toast: okay,  this was highly recommended from other Yelpers.  It's good..... It reminded me of a undercooked pancake, tops with some berries, cream and Dulce de luche.   Definitely a must try if you enjoy sweet desserts.   It was a bit too sweet for my personal liking. 

Overall, I feel like this place is trendy restaurant that differentiates itself from a sea of Asian food.   But to me, the food, taste and portion sizes don't justify the price.  I've tried it and don't have any inkling to try it again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. The atmosphere is great. The food is great. The aestitics is great. The drinks are AWESOMEEEE. Everything was great until I looked in my wallet when I got home.

Going back next week"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, and was glad that I finally got the chance! I went on a Saturday at 630 with two other people, we made reservations, and were seated right away. However, when we got there, the restaurant was still pretty empty, so reservations were  probably not required. But by the time we left around 9pm, the restaurant was completely packed, and there were a few people waiting at the door. The decor was nice, and the service was good. Waitresses were very friendly. 

Now, onto the most important part - the food! 
- We tried the smoked eggplant, angus tartare, and foie gras pate. These all came quickly, and each dish came in portions of two. All three were pretty good, my favourite being the foie gras pate - couldn't get enough of it! 
- From the hot tapas sections, we ordered the fried pork belly and grilled octopus. The fried pork belly was very yummy! The skin was just the right amount of crispiness, and the meat was very tender with just the right amount of fat to make it nice and juicy. I'm a huge fan of octopus, but unfortunately the way the chef made it here was not that great, and I would suggest skipping it.
- And of course we had to try the paella. We ordered the paella de tapagria. Be aware that the paella takes around 40 mins to make. So if you know you want the paella, I would recommend ordering that right when you sit down, before you look through the menu for other items. The paella was delicious. The rice was very flavorful, and they are very generous on the amount of seafood and meat in the dish.
- For dessert, we got the churro with dulce de leche. Again very good. Although I felt that they were a bit cheap on the small portion of dulce de leche we got. It came with four churro,  which I thought was kind of little for the price."}
{"text":"Expect a long wait for the Paella. It's decent, but some might say the wait is unreasonable. The appetizers are a must try. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"giving it only 2 star because I've actually been to tapas, this place was not the authentic kind!"}
{"text":"Probably my first time having authentic Spanish food in the Markham area and it was a unique and worthwhile experience. I came as a party of 4 so I got to try a variety of items on their menu. I didn't have any major issues with any of the dishes (just that they were a little too salty for my palette) but I wasn't ecstatic about the fairly pricey cost of the meal. 

Roasted Bone Marrow - yea, what can I say? It's a fancy food (note: $$$) for fancy people (not me). The flavor was tasty but I would argue it was more salty than roasted or herb-infused. We ordered two so it was a clear depiction that it's purely based on luck how much of your bone actually contains marrow! 

Raw Oysters (half east/half west coast) - Ehhh, we ordered this because I was craving oysters for a long time but it was honestly just really mediocre. I guess this isn't their fault per se since they just shuck em but I think I'll stick to speciality seafood places for my raw oysters.

Hand Carved Serrano - if you like your meats salted and thinly sliced, this is your thing! Very much like prosciutto except it has a more smoky and meaty flavor. 

Mussels - Ehhh, really nothing special. It comes as a small portion and the pieces of mussel meat are also pretty small.

Pescado Frito - nicely presented and tasty deep-fried fish! I gotta say it was a bit too salty but the crunchiness and flavor complemented the tougher texture of the fish well. 

Paella de Tapagria - this was the main show of the meal (aka the reason why I wanted to come in the first place) and it was good - just not exceptional. It was definitely flavorful but nothing about the flavour popped out at me and it also wasn't as aromatic as I had hoped. They were pretty generous with the toppings though and I thoroughly enjoyed the tender pieces of octopus. 

I can't be certain I'll be back but I wouldn't be objected to it! Just gotta be prepared to spend a bit more than usual haha."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday. Since he was craving Spanish food, so we decided to try to this place. The place and customer service are excellent. We got 1 paellas on the menu ( it says take up to 45 mins but I don't think it was that long) I think it came within 30 mins. I did find the food a little on the pricey side for what it's worth. 

The food quality is great. I did find the paellas super satly which result me downing bottles and bottles of water after eating that. 

I'm not sure if i would come back again, maybe for the tapas, the meatballs were amazing. I don't think I'll come back for the Paellas though- to me I don't think it was worth the $45 dollars I paid for."}
{"text":"The ambiance was good, the music and lighting takes you out of Markham. Our server was nice and the food came pretty fast. The food itself was mediocre though, and the paella was kind of dry. I definitely recommend the Spanish toast for dessert, it was the best thing we ate!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was disappointed with this place. I've been to tapas restaurants in Barcelona and I was looking forward to a similar experience. Tapas plates are generally small but our dishes were very small. They were very flavourful but lacking in the main ingredient. The grilled octopus was mostly olives and cherry tomatoes with only 4 small pieces of octopus. 
I wished they served some table bread or at least offer some for sale because it would be great to mop up the flavourful sauces or oils that come with each dish. It would also help balance the saltiness of some of the dishes. 
Service, taste and atmosphere was great. 
Negatives would be high prices for small serving size, limited selection and no bread."}
{"text":"On instagram, we had seen a fellow food blogger show a picture of a secret menu item of a dessert platter.  We asked the server for it and were shortly presented with this amazing dessert platter!

It contained all four of the restaurant's desserts on a platter so that we could try everything at once.  (You have to ask for this since it's not on the menu at all!)  It contained Spanish Toast, Churros with House Sauce, Pastel de Chocolate, and Crema Catalana.  Of these four choices, the Spanish Toast was new to me.  (I recently tried Crema Catalana for the first time at Nuit Social!)"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday and they were able to seat us in a large private room as we had about 15. Points for accommodation! That's as good as it gets really. Some of the tapas we ordered were good, but what's disappointing was the paella. And that's really disappointing since that's what they're supposed to be known for! The flavour just wasn't there. There was a lot of seafood but it was just bland. As great at as the service and atmosphere was, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I had been to this Spanish restaurant now 3-4 times during lunch time... Annoying part about it is that it opens only 3 days a week during lunch time and is missing out on a lot of traffic from Markham's Commerce Valley Drive folks!!  Having said that, let us talk about food, presentation, and Ambience. I give it 4.5 stars for Ambience and Presentation, very slow in service though, but a 4.5-5 stars in quality of food... They have both cold and hot tapas.. However, their top items include Grilled Calamari, PEI mussels,.. But most delicious entree is \" PAELLA DE MARISCOS \"
This is a seafood Paella ( lobster, shrimps, mussels and clams in a great medley ).. Must try good for 2!

Finally, you should ask the server for Spanish coffee and they have a special French Toast dessert but it is nothing like a french toast.. Something amazingly tender, decadent.. I will not spoil it for you.. Experience it yourself... Call them for a night reservation (Fri/Sat/Sun)"}
{"text":"Our first time to this restaurant- our server was awesome, very knowledgeable and recommended some great dishes.


Great ambiance and good for dates. It's on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This is a place to come to with large groups but the food was nothing special for the cost. Definitely a great tapas atmosphere (classic salsas and reggaeton playing all night long!!) and drinks, I just wish the food lived up to the price tag."}
{"text":"That was seriously a welcome change from all the boring old food ... delicious and full of flavor ... great staff ... nice to be able to see the chef do his thing ... great place ... shocked that it wasn't packed evn though it's only 3pm on Sunday"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch of paella with chicken, chorizo, and seafood with churros to end. The paella del tapagria ($45) was full of meaty bites and good for sharing with a couple friends. The service was very attentive and the decor was quite impressive. Next time, I'm coming back with lots of friends to try the tapas menu."}
{"text":"Not as good as Patria downtown, but also probably half the price.  Hey, I'm just glad we now have more than one place to get real Spanish tapas in the city.  Sometimes you just have to have some real Jamon Iberico, y'know?

Anyway, the dishes are a bit hit-and-miss, and the overall experience seemed a bit haphazard.  The pig ears were a little greasy, the truffled cauliflower was not particularly truffle-y, nor was it well-cooked (a little too underdone for what I think they were aiming for), the paella, which you have to order in advance wasn't the most flavourful we've had, and even the Jamon wasn't sliced particularly well (I mean, you can't really do much to mess this up, but the cuts were not even).  At the same time, these were forgiveable.  If we lived closer, we might entertain another visit, but as it stands, we won't be destination dining here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like the paella in Toronto more. Maybe it was an off night, but I was disappointed, as I was excited that I didn't have to go so far for paella. The tapas were great though! And the decor is nice!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place as it looked interesting. I mean, Spanish Tapas in the middle of Hong Kong...Markham??

Decor looks good and the music choice was muy bueno! Staff was friendly and thoroughly enjoyed the service throughout. 

Food was good, I wouldn't say really good, but if you are down for some Spanish food in Markham, I would come here. I got the patatta, pork belly, lobster salad (the papaya in this works surprisingly well!) and carne paella. 

The best part was the dessert - two words: Spanish toast. I would come back here for this in a heartbeat! Churros was ok - came with dolce de leche sauce, which was good."}
{"text":"I was only supposed to come here for a bit of after dinner Sangria. I left greased up, fattened, and with my wallet feeling much, much lighter. What happened??? TAPAS HAPPENED. Granted, I have this bad habit of caving into ordering food when I'm surrounded by friends that are also ordering lots of food. Also can't help the fact that they ordered \"on behalf of all of us\". Since I'm sharing the costs, might as well share the fat. 

What I INTENDED to go there for was the large selection of Sangrias. I can't really remember which ones we got, so I guess they were working their magic on me. First one was kinda yellowy and mango-y and the second one was kinda tropical? Long story short, they're delicious, and the pitchers were perfect for sharing. 

Now the food. I've always been much bigger on food than I am on drinks so THIS, I remember clearly. What can I say? It's hard to forget a large 5lbs. cow bone cut in half glistening in all its meaty, greasy goodness. Yes, the roasted bone marrow ($18). It looked big, but there really wasn't that much. You scoop out the meat butter and spread it on some toast. There weren't any special flavours, but it's fat and sea salt so of course it's good. 

Another favourite was the cheese board ($25) that offered a delicious assortment of hard and soft cheeses. One particular hard one was a slice of heaven when paired with some jam and half a grape. Also gotta love Patatas Bravas ($6), which are potatoes. So simple, but done so right. The main attraction of the night was the hand-carved Serrano ham ($24). It was served in regular slices that you can just pick up with your hands and oh...my...god. All that hammy goodness just melted in my mouth. I kinda understand how some people say food can be addictive. I was addicted to that pig! 

Service was fantastic, especially considering the fact we got in 10 minutes before last call. We were asked multiple times if we wanted anything as the kitchen would be closing soon and this provided ample opportunity for us to order way too much for a group that already had dinner. Don't let that $$ rating fool you though. It's only cheap if you think you can survive on a small plate of potatoes (or as they put it, patatas). It's TAPAS. Prepare to spend like a champ on tiny, tiny portions.

{"text":"Went to this place with high expectations, heard a lot of great reviews read a lot of great reviews, and so i called in a large group of friends to book this restaurant, we had a party of 18. on a friday night. At first when i called, they told me they can't accommodate us at 7:00 and could only do it at 8:15. i thought at first this was because the restaurant was full, and so they had to arrange tables, since we were such a large table. However i found out very quickly this was not true, as one of my friends arrived early at around 7:30 and saw that the place was a ghost town. Basically they didn't want us to occupy their spacing of seats, so that they can sit more people for their \"Busy\" time at 7:00-7:30. This signaled me to what the rest of the night would be like. full of lofty promises and below expectations results.

Our group ordered quite a bit of tapas. we had the spanish meatball, the skirt steak, quite a few platters. and others. Now Tapas i understand are supposed to be small. but usually that is because they at least provide some form of quality and experience to wow. Well this place did neither, their food wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. but it was not worth the price. the food was average at best, and the price they charged, and the food delivered you expected a premium taste, however i can honestly say plenty of spanish restaurants do a better job. We are extremely disappointed, in all the tapas, there wasn't any that stood out as great. only average. the desert was also ridiculously small for the price to the point were we were wondering are they just trying to gouge at this point.

the paella was the only thing that was group portion, and even then it was not spectacular. i heard so many good things about it, and also the long wait time that they told us it would take. i thought this must be something special. Turns out, once again, disappointing, it is average, not good, not great, just average. 

With the average food, i would usually 3 star this place however their raised expectations, and the fact that this place literally lied to our faces for reservations and forced us to come at a later time for no reason other than being greedy, has made me write this place off forever as a disappointment. 

overall i cannot recommend this to anyone, but i understand why people wish it was good as its the only spanish restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for the set menu and had the private dining area reserved. The dining room was very beautiful and private. One of the servers was kinda slow and didn't really understand what to do proactively (e.g. ask if we want any drinks, ask what time we want the tasting menu to start, etc.) but was still very friendly. 

The set menu consisted of the following: kale cauliflower salad, squid and bread, tuna tartare, bacon wrapped dates (MY FAVE!!!!!), truffle Cajun fries, seafood paella, fried chicken, buttered corn, meatballs, potato fritters, and garlic shrimp all for $40 per person. We also ordered several pitchers of sangria.

The food was so yummy and very fresh and the portions were very filling! My group is full of some big eaters but we still had leftovers!

I would definitely recommend the set menu and getting the private dining room for any special function. They also have two other set menus for more money which gives you bone marrow, etc.

Will definitely be coming back to Tapagria for a date night in the future!"}
{"text":"Had a great evening. We were a party of 15 people on a Thursday night. My guest were all from out of province and from the US and I wanted to impress them. The General Manager,  the owner and the team provided amazing service. Everyone was blown away with the food especially the huge land and sea tray, check out my pictures. We also added many different tapas. The variety of drinks were great and on special Thursdays.

The owner provided a special treat and brought out a 36 month old ham and had the chef explain the product and hand craved for us. The ham was the best we ever had.

A must try. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fairly new restaurant, the paella was decent. I found that the apps were not that good and pricey."}
{"text":"Came here for date night and thoroughly enjoyed the entire dinning experience. Although there was just the two of us, we ordered a feast!

ORDER THE PAELLA FIRST. It says it takes about 45 minutes to prepare a paella so order strategically! 

We started off with three tapas. 
1- The grilled octopus ($8) came out first. It had chopped up pieces of octopus and lots of olives and peppers. Not too big a portion of octopus. Not too memorable. 

2- Seared foie gras ($22) came with a generous portion of foie gras on a slice of crispy toast with pieces of mango to add an element of sweetness. This is a must order!! 

3- Roasted bone marrow is $12 but if you get a double order it's just $4 extra for the second piece. Definitely opt for the second piece. Each piece had a generous helping. Very rich and salty. 

We also ordered the 32 oz rib eye ($68). It was HUGE!!! Amazingly seasoned. My boyfriend likes his steak medium (umm..) and usually when we order steak it still comes out still rare. But they got his order just right and he was very pleased. Generous portions of vegetables. This is something you definitely have to share!

Finally the paella ($52)! At this point none of the servers believed that we could've possibly ordered that much food and kept bringing the food to other tables around us (LOL). The paella came loaded with seafood. No stinging out on mussels, calamari, lobster and shrimp here! The rice was lacking a bit of salt or flavour but overall would still recommend. 

Finished off with an order of churros and a side of dulce de leche ($8). They were hot and crispy on the outside but still very soft and doughy on the inside. A perfect ending to a wonderful meal.

The service was good. Very attentive. Our server was still tending to another table and explaining the menu. The manager came over and graciously started us instead, which was very thoughtful. Our server was attentive for the rest of the night. 

Love the atmosphere of Tapagria. I made reservations and good thing I did because it was packed! Loved the wood furniture and warm ambience. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience and would recommend Tapagria to everyone!"}
{"text":"Had a girls night here and it was a pleasant atmosphere with an open concept.  Open kitchen, high ceilings.  

The waitress we had was very polite and friendly. It took us a while to order, since I was busy looking at yelp reviews to see what was good to order. I wanted to try a little of each, but there was only 3 of us, and we definitely wanted to try one of the paellas. 

We ordered the smoked eggplant. This had a bit of cream cheese, and some sundried tomato (I believe), it had a really nice Smokey flavour and piled high. 

Tried the shishito peppers.  This was interesting with a white sauce on top that added some tang.  The peppers were sweet, some had a small kick, but definitely not spicy like jalapeños.  It was a nice finger food to munch on. 

Also had the jamon wrapped dates.  This really had a nice sweet flavour from the dates, but a Smokey maple syrup flavour from the bacon. My friends weren't sure if they like dates, but we gave it a try, and they really enjoyed the mixture of flavours. 

We ordered the paella Tapagria.  This had a mixture of seafood and Chorizo.  The shrimp were large in size, the mussles and clams were meaty.  My friend has an allergic reaction when she has seafood that is not fresh, but this seafood was really fresh! The rice was well seasoned.  The Chorizo were cut a little too thin, it was like a crunchy chip. 

To end it off we had the Spanish toast.  And yes! It's very good.  The crisp of torched sugar on top, with a soft toast soaked in custard!! 

I'm interested to come back on Tuesday for their buck a shuck oysters! Plus to try many other tapas on their menu!"}
{"text":"What you may want to skip and why:

1. Venison Carpaccio ($14) - not much flavour, not comparable to nice carpaccios we have tried elsewhere

2. Grilled Skirt Steak ($8) - even though they give you a generous portion of mushroom and beef, and it is generally a tasty dish, there is nothing special about this. Better save your stomach space and money on something else.

Top picks (no particular order):

1. Spanish Toast ($10)
2. Hamon (ham) wrapped dates ($8) - if you have a sweet tooth, you prolly will like this one
3. Fried Pork Belly ($12) - perfect meat-fat ratio
4. Octopus salad ($12) - refreshing in a fairly big portion

If you like oysters, come on Tuesdays, with a drink of $6 (their virgin sangria was pretty good), you get to have $1/oyster, up to a dozen!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but also not extraordinary either. The food is good and the prices would be what you would expect for tapas. That being said, the proteines entrees are very pricey and prob not worth the prices they are charging. The 32oz steak is very delicious and cooked to perfection with a lovely flavorful sauce and lots of good veg - but it's not worth $72!! 32oz includes the weight of the bone because they definitely want enough meat to be 32oz. The grilled octopus was delicious and tender - even though we ordered the half portion, it seemed like the full portion. Foie gras pate was good and rich but overly sweet. The items I wouldn't recommend is the bone marrow and the paellas as they are very underwhelming and not worth it. Paella was heavily seasoned with paprika, to the point where you couldn't get a good idea of the flavors and the rice was undercooked even after 45 min of cooking time (as per the menu). Churros are not light and fluffy but a little dense and stubby. All in all I would probably go back to try a few more tapas especially their cured meats but the options are not as vast as some other tapas restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Food is decent but very overpriced. 

Had chickpea and tuna salad and octopus salad, weren't very good. Bone marrow and fois gras were amazing, but super expensive. 

Decor is nice."}
{"text":"Came here for Sat brunch and ordered the individual portion Paella ($18) and Huevos benedict ($16). The Paella had very little taste, the octopus pieces were tender but the rest of the seafood was overcooked and chewy. The benedict was overly salty from the Serrano ham and not very well balanced. Portions are typical for a tapas restaurant, so expect to leave hungry. Restaurant atmosphere is nice and very friendly server. But not overly impressed on the quality or taste of the food though... Much better choices downtown."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars
Food met my expectations but nothing amazing.  I think its worth while trying if you want tapas and need to stay uptown."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and service was even better. (Thx to Gill and the manager. !!!! If you've been to Bar Isabel or Patria, this is just as good, i consder better...a must try for all, not just suburbanites."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Markham.  I've been here several times and never get bored of the food. My brother and I are fussy when choosing restaurants and this place is always a sure bet for us."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were have been meaning to try Tapagria since noticing that it took over part of the space previously occupied by Go For Tea in Richmond Hill. It apparently opened about 1.5 months ago. The restaurant is nicely decorated, from the unique lighting fixtures, beautiful wood tables, exposed brick, and Spanish inspired murals and tiles. They have a separate area from the kitchen where the cured Serrano and Iberico ham would be carved and some of the tapas are plated, as well as a \"ham wall\" where the cured meat is on display. There is also a separate room for special events or large parties that apparently can seat up to 30 people.
As we didn't have a reservation and many of the other tables were taken, we were seated at the bar seating area. Our server Tommy took the time to ask if we had ever had tapas before and explained the specials as well as answered our questions about what the most popular dishes are. There are a selection of cold and hot tapas dishes as well as pintxos (small dishes that involve the use of small skewers). There are also much more substantial menu items such as grilled ribeye, grilled pulpo or octopus, a grilled fish dish, or 2 different types of paella which would be better suited for larger parties or those with bigger appetites. 
After reviewing the menu, we opted to order a selection of tapas/pintxos dishes as kale and roasted cauliflower salad, smoked eggplant pintxos, grilled octopus, grilled skirt steak, and the clam and chorizo dish. This was further supplemented with a small assorted cheese board. 
We started off with the clam and chorizo dish. This had a subtle smoked paprika flavour to it and the warm cherry tomatoes were a refreshing accompaniment to the clams and non-spicy chorizo. The smoked eggplant spread pintxos was served in a toasted crostini with a soft white cheese and a smear of jam. It too was very tasty. The kale and cauliflower salad was a palate cleanser in a way, as the crunch of the kale was nicely balanced against the seasoned roasted cauliflower. We had asked for the grilled skirt steak to be cooked to medium doneness but it seemed to be more on the medium-rare side. It had a nice flavour to it, with herbs and garlic on top, but a tad chewy unfortunately. The grilled octopus was marinated well. While the smaller pieces of octopus were quite tasty and perfectly cooked, both hubby and I found the larger pieces of octopus chewy. I would recommend cutting larger pieces of grilled octopus with a knife or you'll find yourself chewing for quite a while! 
The smaller cheese board had 3 different types of cheeses (Cambozola, Manchego, and another softer creamy cheese that reminded me a bit of Brie), as well as sliced fruit and 3 types of fruit compotes/spreads including fig, pear, and quince. This was served with several crostinis. I quite liked the Manchego cheese and the softer creamy cheese, while my hubby preferred the blue cheese. 
Not surprisingly, after the cheese board and 5 tapas dishes we were quite full but wanted to try some dessert. We ordered the pastel de chocolate, a dark chocolate cake with strawberries on top that was coated in a chocolate glaze. It was surprisingly not too sweet, which suited my palate just fine. Perhaps next time I will try their churros with dulce de leche sauce.
Given the cool atmosphere/vibe, attentive servers, and solid food, I would definitely return to this place. We hope next time to try something from their large selection of sangrias, as well as their paella.

{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here on Valentines Day. The lobster was fresh and the steak was perfectly cooked. I want to try the Paella and a few other things on my next visit. We had a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Loved the tuna tartar. Kale and Strawberry Salad was delicious too (though slightly too much dressing for my taste)."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's on the pricier side but food is amazing. We ordered a paella, bone marrow and a sangria. Both are exceptional. I will definitely revisit to try out different dishes."}
{"text":"This is a treat, especially for richmond hill, but it sure is pricey! I'd definitely recommend going at least once though, because the food is phenomenal. 

I came here last night, not really knowing what to expect because I'm not too familiar with tapas. The menu was confusing at first, until the waitress explained it to us and took her time explaining the specials. The paellas look really yummy, except we couldn't eat it due to a shellfish allergy my friend had. That's cool, we ventured onto a lot of the other dishes. We had bone marrow (my fave!!) + grilled steak skirt + lobster salad (only for me, again because of allergic reasons) + meat platter + angus tartare. A bunch of tapas that costed around $85 incl. tip. We both shared it, and I was absolutely stuffed. The waitress recommended us to get 8-9 tapas between 2 people in the beginning, but seriously if I did that, I would've bursted inside the restaurant. 

The angus tartare was amazing. Extremely flavourful and they don't skimp out on the beef. 
Bone marrow was deliciously flavoured. One of them had a shitload of oil though. In fact, it created a new renewable oil resource on a plate we had.
Lobster salad was absolutely delicious. There were more veggies than lobster, but the overall taste was incredible. I think it was macadamia nuts x avocado x papaya x lettuce x other delicious stuff to make a great spicy lobster salad. Needless to say, I got filled on avocado.
Steak skirt was perfectly rare, just the way I like it. It definitely melts in your mouth.
Meat platter was not really eaten by me, but it had a bunch of interesting meats and fruits on it. It was also accompanied by some bread.

Overall, service was friendly and prompt. I don't think we ever had an empty cup, as they kept coming around and around to fill us up with water. I'd definitely come back after being broke from christmas to try the other tapas, and hopefully a paella!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, only if they add abit more flavour to it. A bit over price. However nice environment and excellent service. I was surprise this place is not full on a Saturday night maybe not even half full."}
{"text":"With exposed brick walls, beautiful Spanish tiles lining the fixtures and an open kitchen, the space got a really trendy makeover from what used to be GoForTea. Definitely a great addition to the food scene in Richmond Hill to bring some authentic Spanish tapas to the area.

Thumbs up: 
1) Jamon de Iberico - MAJOR highlight of the night. I recently saw a documentary of high quality Iberico cured meat made from happy Spanish pigs frolicking around the fields only eating the freshest acorns and I was SOO excited to discover they had this on the menu! $22 for a few good slices but it's really worth trying. 

2) Kale cauliflower salad - Super fresh kale and perfectly roasted cauliflower, the truffle oil on this was so potent and delicious.

Just okay: 
1) Pintxo - Probably the most disappointing for me.. We ordered the eggplant and sardines pintxos which should be crowd pleasers but from presentation to taste they were a bit lackluster. 

2) Patatas bravas - Potatoes with a tomato meat sauce and one of their most popular items but the potatoes were dry even after dousing it in the sauce.

3) Paella de mariscos -  For a hefty price tag of $52, I expected to this to be the star of the show. With lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari, the presentation was spot on but I felt they could do a better job with the flavours. 

This resto seems really promising and with some tweaks I think they could make a real killing in the area. Service could definitely be more attentive as it was pretty hard to flag down our server the whole night. Hopefully the kinks will be worked soon and then I would be a happy regular."}
{"text":"very limited menu selection, so I was expecting that each item would be done well.  It's very mediocre.  The drinks however are quite nice.  The food overall lacks flavour, especially the paella.  The snails, while overpowered by wine, was quite a large size with clams in there as well which was nice.   By the end we all felt a little sick as some of the items were overly oily."}
{"text":"Uptown needed a place like this! (5 stars because there is literally no place to get tapas in the markham area) Came here twice (tried a lot of things on the menu!), first for a girls dinner and second for a date. The place itself feels spacious and open, although the restaurant is never full when I am there, always empty tables sadly. The service is not bad, the first time the waiter was attentive and friendly. The second time the waitress was a bit off and felt a bit like she didn't really want to be there but still ok. But overall the food here is really good!

The Tapas:
- Angus tartare was good, had a heavy mustard taste.
- Foie gras pate was creamy, smooth but the mango wasn't very mangoy and didnt go with it so well
- Pan con Tomate - good, but not as good as bar isabels!
- Grilled octopus - the octopus wasnt chewy at all and came with a tomatoy sauce with lots of olives and a bit spicy, definitely mop up that sauce with the bread!
- Salted cod croquettes - not enough cod and pretty small in size, not memorable, probably skip it
- Bone marrow - they have a special 2 bones for $16, exactly what you expected fatty salty goodness, always a fan 
- Grilled skirt steak - came with a chimichurri-ish sauce, steak was well cooked, it was a good meat option for only $8
- Steam mussels - there were 6 mussels in the serving in a spicy tomato sauce, the sauce was so good I had to eat it all with the bread
- Jamon wrapped dates - sweet and salty, it was delicious but im personally not a huge fan of whole dates

Also tried the cheese and cured meat boards. The cheese board was really good, lots of variety and 3 different fruit compotes (the apple one was the best), pears and a few grapes. The meat board wasn't bad the only disappointing one was the salami but the other selection was good. 

Also tried the Tapagria paella (im a paella snob so it wasn't as authentic as I wanted it to be, there was no saffron flavour) but nonetheless was still good. Came out really hot, was flavourful and the serving was large. The seafood was cooked nicely, a few pieces of chicken were on the dry side but the rest was fine. 

You can also ask for the dessert sampler platter (approx. $30 so its a bit pricey) came with spanish toast, few churros with dulce de leche, a citrus creme brulee of sort (wish the top was more burnt) and a chocolate cake. Overall the cost per person was between $30-$70 depending on how much you order"}
{"text":"Came on a weeknight with no reservations and was seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and attentive and the food was good overall, but don't be fooled by the $$ rating on yelp because this place is actually pretty pricy! The Spanish meatballs were okay but the size of quail eggs. The paella de Tapagria was delicious but quite oily. Not sure if the shrimp in the dish was fresh because it was a little mushy and didn't have that bounce, and the chorizo in the dish definitely felt like it was cooked in wine. The Spanish toast was delicious but quite a small portion for $10. It's a unique dish though and worth a try. Maybe next time we'll be back for brunch since the food isn't bad but the brunch prices seem more reasonable."}
{"text":"I went there for a celebration, and I gotta say that the environment was quite nice, however, if you are feeling for some authentic Spanish food, I would suggest you go to one of the latin restaurants downtown. 

We ordered 3 tapas (avocado tuna tartare, Spanish meatballs, spicy octopus), paella de Tapagria, and pineapple+mint cocktail. The food was mediocre, but the drink was really flavourful and strong. 

Based on my experience and food ordered:
Ambience + environment = 4/5
Service = 5/5
Drinks = 5/5
Food = 3/5"}
{"text":"I've concluded that Spanish food is some of the most expensive. The lunch special paella, $18 for a small bowl of rice with a mussel, half a shrimp, 2 calamari rings, a scallop and a side salad is expensive, compared to Chinese, where I can get a large portion ofduck and BBQ pork on a massive bed of rice for $10. With soup. And tea. 

At the high end of the menu is a ribeye steak for $68. At that price I would be in a Ruth's Chris or an AYCE Brazilian steak place. 

Still, this small portion of rice had incredible flavour-much more than Lobo Iberico in Newmarket for the same money. I added an order of appetizer olives, and still left ready to eat more. 

Tapagria is a great place to socialize in a nice environment.  The interior is quite rich and spacious. Service was friendly and attentive. Bring your credit card and just live like price is no object."}
{"text":"The food was ok, had the chicken and chorizo paella & seafood paella. Rice was tasty but the meat was dry. The hostess was rude and had a RBF the entire time. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is definitely different from many other restaurants in this area. Not really the large franchise places, or the ayce variety. But it definitely had that large franchise feel, but not exactly the same.

 In coming in it looks big, and it's busy, just not like line out the door busy. It has high ceilings, a bar to the right with one TV. Atop the bar is what looks like decor cages but is fact storage. You got your cold room in back with cured meats hanging. Then this odd open preparation are where the cured meats are cut.

So if you a couple people, order the paella immediately as it takes a long time. Then look at the tapas or order sangria.

As for the tapas, we tried quite a few, won't name them all bit what I remember.
Pintxos: basically it's bruschetta made with different toppings. The best was the smoked eggplant.

Shishito peppers, not quite too hot be beware of the top where the seeds exist as there still is a punch.

Jamon Iberico: before you order ask for the detailed in the difference. At least for our waiter the explanation was great. The subtle flavor of acorn was very much apparent.

Paella de tapagria: served on a skillet it's very hot temperature when it comes out. The flaw to this, and I'm not sure if it's always the case is it tasted a bit burnt. There were definitely some burnt remnants in there. Tasted decent but just not the greatest.

All in all I think it still is pretty good. But when you advertise this paella, it better be stellar."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love Spanish food. We have been to Barcelona and Seville before, and are always excited to try Spanish restaurants in the city. Tapagria serves a good paella, but still have room to go if you are looking for one of the best seafood paella in the city. I would still come to get my fix of Spanish food in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"Came here after viewing some properties in the area. It was my first time trying authentic Spanish cuisine. So glad there's other ethnic cuisine other than more Asian food in the area... lol 

Ordered a couple of hot tapas to share, but they  were overly salty. I don't recommend the tapas here, especially the escargot. There were more button mushrooms in the dish than the actual escargot itself. Also, this dish is typically served with bread, so it can be dipped into the rich escargot sauce. We did not get bread and asked our server for it. She made up some excuse that escargot is meant to be eaten by itself so you can truly experience fine Spanish cuisine. BS. Asked another server to bring us bread, and she kindly obliged. Thank you!

The sangria also tasted kinda weak. Not much alcohol in it. If you're thirsty, you can order a pitcher as it's a better value than ordering it by glass. 

The paella was the highlight!! Ordered the mushroom & truffle paella, and you can see a lot of different mushrooms were used in this dish. Flavour, texture and aroma was good, and definitely worth the 45 min wait. If you visit this establishment, I only recommend trying the paella!!"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and it was dead... they had so many empty tables! Decor was nice but nothing I wouldn't expect at a Spanish tapas restaurant in the fast developing Markham. Our server seemed to forget about us often. Food was mediocre - nothing that surprised me, although the lobster salad was best thing I ate there. It was complex - it had papaya and macadamia nuts in it. I don't think I'll come back unless it's to try the buck-a-shuck Tuesday."}
{"text":"My husband celebrated his birthday at Tapagria yesterday and we chose to do it at Tapagria. We booked the large party room that fits 36 people. Last minute, 44 people showed up and the staff and manager Art was nothing short of excellent in accommodating extra tables and chairs. All the servers were super friendly! The atmosphere was so nice... and the food was delicious as always. We had a wonderful time! Thank you Art and your team at Tapagria :)"}
{"text":"They have solid paellas, and I've been to Barcelona recently! They have weekly specials like half priced Sangrias which are also very tasty.

I really enjoy their steak which is aged, flavourful and cooked perfectly as always. They give a side of grilled garlic on the whole head which is really tasty.

I love the decor, its upscale and modern. It looks like a restaurant that would normally be downtown. 

Tapagria is always on our list of go-to restaurants when my husband and I are in the mood for a weekday datenight."}
{"text":"No one reached out to us about the service or the attitude of the waiter so I still give this place 1 star.. it sucks and it's not even Spanish food. I would rather eat somewhere where they train their wait staff to be respectable to all their diners. Which this place is not at all. Very disappointed with their lack of service and lack of follow ups....

Whoever rates this place 4-5 stars have no tastebuds and would probably eat any garbage given to them!

Would recommend anywhere else but here!"}
{"text":"I'll keep is short and simple. Food was fantastic! Fresh, flavorful and kept wanting to try more and more things off the menu. We had a mix of tapas items and were still hungry so ordered the paella which filled us. Drinks were excellent. Service was attentive and prompt. Only complaint is that I felt items were overpriced for the amount of food provided."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. I would come here again for the beef bone marrow with bread and the spicy squid. The restaurant is divided up into two areas (sports bar and a dining area.) Waiting staff was good and helpful with recommendations. The value for food was decent but on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Came to Tapagria for dinner and had a wonderful time here. Service was great.
The interior was nicely decorated and had a retro / classy feel to it. 
We ordered a looootttt of food:

DRINKS:
* LYCHEE SANGRIA (for us girls): 
We couldn't taste any alcohol, which we liked. It was very sweet, but the boys said it was too sweet for their liking and ended up ordering beer lol.
* BEER (for the boys; Spanish beer - I forgot the name :S)

What I liked about the tapa dishes here was that everything actually came as a \"sizzling hot tapas\" dish - you'd be surprised at how many tapas dishes that come in room temperature..

JAMÓN WRAPPED DATES (5/5)
The jamón wrapped dates were delicious. It's new to me because I usually order jamón as a cold dish with cantaloupes.

SALTED COD CROQUETAS (5/5)
This was so good! The breaded crust was crunchy on the outside, soft in the inside. If only the portions were a tad bigger. Its taste is similar to a crab cake but I like the salted cod more in comparison.

GRILLED OCTOPUS (3/5)
The flavour of this tapas dish was great, but I didn't like the combo of octopus and olives (personal opinion because I'm \"meh\" with olives).

ROASTED BONE MARROW (3.5/5)
The roasted bone marrow was great! What could make it better is that the salt be added on the side rather than already on top of the bone marrow. It was a tad too salty! Otherwise, yummy! :)

PAELLA DE MARISCOS (3/5)
(bomba rice, lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, saffron, peas)
They put a lot of ingredients! But we thought the other dishes that we've order stood out more than this paella.

CHULETÓN ASADO (4/5)
(32oz roasted rib eye, garlic, charred scallion, romesco)
Sooo good! The meat was very tender and juicy - if only there was less fat in the meats (we had to cut out a chunk of fatty out!). One of my favourite dishes of the night!

DESSERTS:
[ We were already stuffed after all the food we ordered... but there's always room for desserts... haha ]

CHURROS WITH NUTELLA (2/5)
Not special, and the churros were half its usual size. 

SPANISH TOAST (5/5)
We should've just ordered two of this because it's SO GOOD! Tastes like the Japanese dessert \"Mochi\", which is a sticky rice that's sweet. It looks like a pancake - it's crispy on the outside but inside has a texture like a pudding / mochi. So good! I'd recommend you ordering this! :D"}
{"text":"Atmostphere: 2/5
Came here for Valentine's day with a reservation requesting for their best seat they had. They gave us a semi-circle couch seat in the back corner of the restaurant near the bar and a large window and it was SO cold! They had one heater blowing the opposite direction of our half of the room. Other than the lack of heat, the seating and decor was nice and comfortable. Great date spot with low lighting. 

Service: 4/5
The server did a great job. He served us complimentary tea to make up for the lack of comfort and checked up on us often. Actually all the staff minus the hostess were great! They were all tentative and described each dish as they were served. The hostess seemed to need more training or experience in general. My friend's previous experience with the same hostess had my friend giving the hostess the suggestion of waiting at the bar for the next available table. When asked how long the wait would be the hostess simply said \"I don't know.\" Which is better than lying and saying 10-15mins if you really don't know but as a hostess it's your job to know.

Food: 3/5
As we sat down we order the paella de tapagria right away as it would take a while to make. 

We decided on the jamon(JAMON! - bacon) wrapped dates in sweet sauce. I thought this was their best dish we had, it had the crispy bacon and mushy dates and sweet with savory flavors. I like contrasting textures like crispy fries with mashed potato-esque insides so this tapas was right up my in my mouth hole.

The angus tartare with truffle oil on what I think is a piece of french baguette (probably wrong). It's exactly that, nothing special. This was my least favourite dish. It was actually not enjoyable because I don't like truffles and I don't like raw minced meat (I like carpaccio though) and this was basically that on toast. The toast was good.. I can't give this dish a good judgement because of my dislike of the ingredients so you have to try it yourself if it sounds appetizing to you.

The paella arrived on a hot skillet it had bomba rice, shrimp, chorizo, hen breast in 2 pieces, mussels, clams, octopus, and peas. I'm on a side quest to look for the best paella and after this one, I'm still on that quest. This paella is decent but not what I expected. Our's was more smokey than we would've liked, almost burnt tasting on some parts. The rice wasn't as infused with flavour but with such a short cooking time I can't see how it would. It was, I guess, \"A-OK.\" Maybe some lemon or lime would've been good to cut the smoke.

To conclude I wouldn't come here for their paella, personally. I would come back to try their other tapas dishes and their huge selection of sangria but that will have to wait for the Summer when their building is actually warm."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. We were lured here by their oyster night special. Tuesdays oysters are a buck apiece. But only if you order a drink. (Which we would have done anyway)

The decor is beautiful. Loved the high ceilings soft lighting and gorgeous tiles along the bar area.

We got a couple of side dishes which were a little bland and oily. Would have been nice with some crusty bread but none offered. 

One of the downsides was the sound system. It sounded tinny and to make matters worse they played the Macarena. I know you're trying to be all Spanish but... No, just no.

I felt a little rushed with staff wanting to take plates away before we ate the food on them. After declining twice, they should take the hint. It's not like there was a lineup of people waiting to get a table. 

In the end, I enjoyed the oysters and white wine. That's what we came for. But not sure it was enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day and the place was not as packed as I thought it would be. 

For food alone, I would give this place 3 stars. 

Right when we sat down, we ordered the Paella de Tapagria first as it takes ~45 minutes for them to make it and for the \"flavors to blend\". Aside from the Paella, we also ordered most of the hot tapas and my favorites were the truffle croquetas and the roasted bone marrow. 

I felt that many of the dishes were lacking in flavor (such as the salt cod cakes which replaced the shrimp cakes on the menu that night) or were just average (like the tender steak fillet). Also, I found that the bread that came with a few dishes was a bit on the hard side and was tough to chew.

However, I really enjoyed the Paella and it was also a decent sized portion (well it better be for $45). 

What made this place 4 stars for me was the ambiance, the decor and also the service. I really enjoyed the service as we had brought a cake from a bakery to celebrate Father's Day and for dessert, our server brought it out on a very nice serving dish which we really appreciated. 

I would probably come back again on a Monday for their paella and sangria special but I don't think I would be back for the Tapas."}
{"text":"Very cool place amongst a large population of restaurants in a small area. Stopped in on a business trip and bellied up to the bar.  Bartender was friendly and engaging and offered some suggestions. Glad I listened to him!  The bacon wrapped dates were delicious (his suggestion). The skirt steak and potatoes were good but not an all star like the dates. BUT the best dessert I may have ever had is the Spanish toast (again the bartender recommendation). It is worth coming back for, trust me."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to seat. The service was pretty good. That's about the only thing I like about this restaurant. The menu is very limited variety and the price is expensive. We ordered the 26oz steak $46 which is not bad. The $34 whole chicken was very dry. There was no fish at all this evening which that's what I wanted. The platter was very simple made. The bone marrow was really to look at because there isn't anything to eat on it. The perella   $45 which is a joke.  7 of us left with the bill of $265.00 and we felt we didn't eat anything. That was included some beer. Surely we won't go back again."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 rating

Tapagria is a beautiful restaurant with plenty of seating. The seating and atmosphere are comfortable, the decorations are rustic, I would have said western if it wasn't a Tapas restaurant, so I'll say rustic Spanish. 

We ordered a pitcher of Lychee Sangria made with white wine and it was delicious, very fruity due to the Lychee and not too sweet. I would order that again, anytime, and would be perfect in the summer!

We ordered the following dishes and enjoyed the share plate/family style dining.
- Pan con tomate - Well-made tomatoes on crunchy toasts
- Smoked eggplant - Nicely made and smooth
- Salmon pâté - light and creamy
- Sardine & tomato - served on toast and very tasty with a light tomato sauce
- Duck confit - very flavorful, served on toast
- Kale cauliflower salad - Very nice dressing with kale and perfectly cooked cauliflower
- Jamón wrapped dates - Excellent, these were the hero of the table, we ordered a second helping. They are a mixture of salt and sweet, dates wrapped in crunchy ham, mmm.
- Spanish meatballs - Delicious, perfect texture, nice tomato based sauce wth a bit of cheese
- Grilled calamari - Cooked perfectly, but not properly seasoned. The light dusting of dry chili rub was missing salt, the bland chili was a bit bitter.
- Aged cheese board - nicely presented with 4 types of cheeses, chutney, frozen grapes olives crunchy toasted French (possibly Spanish) bread. Very small serving size.

I think I will come back and try a different part of the menu."}
{"text":"I remember first trying Tapagria when it opened last year - tapas were just medicore for me, but I liked the guava sangria, and the paella, while lacking in flavour, had large pieces of seafood. Despite not measuring up to my downtown favourites, I've still been back a few times since and found a few good items and stuck with those:

1. Kale & Cauliflower salad - can't go wrong with truffle oil! 
2. Rib Eye - 24oz good for 2 people, with roasted whole garlic
3. 40 degree salmon - on the fence about this one - soft, melt-in-your-mouth salmon, I found it too oily but I liked the avocado spread & the beets on the side."}
{"text":"This place has a super cute vibe and great food! The only reason I did four stars was the service was verry slow. There was only one waitress for the whole place! She was running around like crazy and only had time to take our order and check. Not her fault but disappointing as we came here to drink sangria and taste the different tapas."}
{"text":"Good restaurant in a bad location. 

Located where Go For Tea used to be, it is large in size and has been totally redone inside with great décor. 

Our group of 4 came in for brunch at 12pm on a Saturday.. and it was completely empty. There was one group of 2-3 leaving as we came in, but for the whole time we dined until we left.. it was just us and the staff - which was a little alarming. Not sure if that is how it is in the evening during dinner service, but if they continue going down this road, I don't know if they will last too long. 

Service was good, but I guess it was cause we were the only ones there haha. But he was attentive and quick. 

I shared the steak and eggs and the porchetta with a friend. Everything was nice, the porchetta came on top of a parsnip puree which was amazing! So flavourful. The steak was tender and sliced up. But it was a little overdone for what we asked for. We asked for medium rare and it came medium. Also, everything we had wasn't hot. Just warm.. not sure why?

The others at our table ordered the Spanish toast and the huevos benedict. I didn't get to try it, but they told me it was good, especially the Spanish toast. 

I want to come back here to try dinner, as I've seen people posting some nice looking foie gras and it looked so good. 

Oh by the way, they have buck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. The first time for lunch and the second time for Valentine's Day (booked through Open Table). The very first time I came, I had the paella and some decorated fries for appetizers. Pictures are attached. To be blunt, that was not enough to satisfy my appetite and I don't consider myself to be someone who eats a lot to be full. 

For Valentine's, they only had the Valentine's special we can choose from. My partner and I decided to go for the $95 + tax deal with the appetizer, mains and desserts. It was the cheapest one and we decided to go for that one because when we were comparing all the deals we couldn't justify paying $100+ more for lobster over shrimp, and alcohol for dessert. Mind you, I'm not much of an alcohol drinker though. The appetizers were the exact same for all the deals though. 
We got the steak and shrimp for the mains. It was way too seasoned for our taste and the steak was more over well done when we asked for medium rare. Overall, nothing that stood out that would be worth the price."}
{"text":"Was there for v-day. They had prix fix menu. The steak was salty. It was inedible. The other food was okay. Too much salt."}
{"text":"Pleasant environment and friendly staff. A bit disappointed with food being too greasy. Be prepare to drink lots of hot tea to degrease your intestine."}
{"text":"This place is the pinnacle of scraping by. Like me in high school, didn't do much and didn't end up exceeding expectations. My sisters already warned me about this place being shit but I didn't listen. 

I got the smoked eggplant which was literal grey mush on bread. If you're gonna do a eggplant mash of some type PEEL THE SKIN OFF. It tasted like raw blended eggplant.

Also got seared foie gras which was smaller than my thumb and i'm a small asian girl. However, I think it had good flavour. 

The mussels tasted only of paprika so if you're into that then go ahead and order it.

Lastly the paella tapagria was not worth the $45 at all. The seafoods all frozen and theres not much of anything other than rice. I also got a huge bite of just salt in my mouth. I'd only recommend it if you came here super hungry and needed something filling.

ALSO SERVICE WAS PRETTY BAD. It started off great but by the end of the meal our waiter was busy doing other things..."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to come here on a double date with one of my friends who just got engaged! I've been meaning to check this place out for a while now.

The atmosphere is quite nice, it's big, roomy, the ambiance is nice, reminds me of a modern spanish restaurant that one would usually see downtown. there was lots of seating space and it's not too loud so makes it easy to have great conversation during dinner. 

We ordered a few tapas as well as their paella. the paella takes 45 mins so it takes a little while to make so my suggestion is to order that first, then mull over the menu for tapas. We also ordered a pitcher of tropical sangria to share. it was really good :)

we ordered the smoked eggplant on a slice of toast - it was alright, I could taste the smoke but otherwise it wasn't very spectacular.

Spanish meatballs: must have and must try. the tomato sauce it comes in is delicious and the meat is quite tender!

Fried Pork belly: another must have - the skin was nice and crispy, and the meat is balanced out with the pork fat so it's not overly mushy and not overly dry.

Mushroom Croquette: it was DEF. a must eat!!!! this was actually my favourite tapa along with the meatballs. it's basically mushroom with a deep fried dough with something creamy inside. arg enjoyed every bite!

Carne Paella: we decided not to try the tapagria one only because my friend doen'st like octopus. This paella was very good! the portions are enough for 4 ppl to split equally no problem. the taste was well balanced witht he meat, not overly salty and we all had second scoops :)

Dessert we had the spanish toast - since ppl raved about it on yelp and also as per our waitress' recommendfation. it's basically a very RICH pancake soaked in custard sauce with caramel drizzled over. since we already ate so much food, a quarter of the toast per person was the perfect amt for tasting and not feel grossly full lol.

All in all, i enjoyed this place! and would def. consider coming back again in the future :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a times, and each experience has been very different. The food has improved and the last time I went, I really enjoyed: foie gras, squid ink paella, fried chicken, calamari, truffle cauliflower, and spicy octopus. Love the decor of the restaurant. However, on several occasions the service was a miss and they do not have a lot of their wines offered on their small wine list."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here - the staff were very knowledgeable and courteous, lots of seating space, and the food was delicious and arrived quickly! 
Instead of getting the larger dishes, we opted for a lot of the smaller sharing dishes, in which we really enjoyed the Fried pork belly, Jambon bacon wrapped dates, and the Angus tartare. The only thing is that I find the food somewhat pricey for what you're getting in terms of size and portion, but I guess that's the nature of a tapas restaurant (so reconsider if you're on a budget, or if looking to get full). Having a bigger group to order more food and spread out the cost just means less food to go around for more mouths. The nice thing about this place is that they've got an extensive drink menu to choose from. But not so fast, drinks are also pretty expensive here as well. Overall, a nice place to try at least once, but be prepared to splurge. 

On a final note, if you're going to get dessert here try the \"Spanish Toast\" -- highly recommended, it was super delicious!"}
{"text":"Came on saturday for brunch and they only offered set menu options.
Service was good and the food was decent but it didnt offer anything spectacular taste wise.
The most disappointing part of the set menu was the dessert.
They offered tea + cookie or coffee + cookie.
The coffee was nothing special and the cookie...turned out to be Dad's cookies...cannot get worse than that."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice but the quality of food is just no where close to what's expected.  We ordered four tapas and 2 cocktails and the only thing that was worth the money was the drinks.  
Also, for some odd reason, they chose to play house music in a Spanish restaurant.  The choice was just terrible for the setting and this is coming from a fan of house music."}
{"text":"Very nice open design. Came here during lunch hours on a Friday at around 1:00pm. The place was not very busy which made service very attentive. 

Skirt steak $8 - about the size of a smartphone (like a Samsung S6 size). Seasoned and marinated very well which made it taste pretty good but we found the meat to be very tough and chewy. It was cooked medium rare just the way I liked.

Angus tartare $10 - comes with two pieces. Basically seasoned raw beef diced up into small pieces and almost like a paste served on a baguette. I think this was my favourite item.

Double bone marrow $16 (single bone marrow is $12) - comes with 6 pieces of baguette. The bone marrow was very flavourful and it was like eating flavoured butter. The 2nd bone seemed smaller and was half empty :( This is probably only the 2nd time in my life having bone marrow like this. It was good but at a cost. 

Chicken sandwich $16 - comes with a side salad of kale and baby tomatoes. The salad was fresh and went well with the lemony vinaigrette. The sandwich was good with mayo type sauce that was mixed in with the chicken served on a baguette type bread. If I didn't order this sandwich I doubt I would be full since this was the only item we ordered that was an actual meal.   

Creme brule $8 - topped with a little bit of fig. I didn't like the figs much but the rest of creme brule is on par with others. I just wish the whole top part of the creme brule was sugar coated. This one only the centre was coated and I found it to be on the small side. 

Overall, I thought the food had great flavours. The only downfall was the skirt steak being tough and chewy. Price is a bit on the high side but expected at these type of restaurants.

Solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Wonderful environment with big murals and high ceilings. Good for date night!
Must try spanish toast! It is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. We came later in the evening so there wasn't a lot of people. It took a few moments for a hostess to greet us but we were seated in a nice area in front of a cured meats bar. I tried this place when they first opened a few months ago right after a trip to Barcelona so it was nice to compare to an authentic Spanish cuisine. The portions were larger than traditional tapas which I was grateful for. The prices were very reasonable and better value for the size and quality of food. I really enjoyed the salad and the tapas sampler. I requested for some condiments to compliment the plate of Iberico ham and the server was so kind to provide extras with our takeout. Overall this is a great restaurant and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Friendly service, catchy music, good food.

We enjoyed an early Mothers Day dinner tonight. What we ordered from most to least liked:
Lobster salad - scrumptious
Salmon tartare - delicious special
Blackberry mojito - strong and yummy
Serrano ham - very good
Aged cheese plate - good
Tomato toast - good
Skirt steak - but chewy
Chorizo - was okay

Two adults, one child. We were stuffed and had no room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm going to prompt my review with the fact that everything was good. I am rating as a 3 because it wasn't great/excellent. 

Overall ambiance and decor is good. We came in for lunch where they have a pre-fixed menu of a soup/salad, main dish, and a cookie. 

I am rating a 3 on food quality because I feel like every dish we had needed something more. 

The red pepper soup was good but lacked in a strong flavor. It needed a bit of a punch. 

The farmer's plate was a simple breakfast almost with potatoes, eggs, and bacon. 

The pasta con carne had great meat and pasta, but then the sauce was a thinner tomato. It needed a heartier sauce to pair. 

The lamb chop was good by the polenta that came with was bread-like and not creamy at all. 

The cookies were oatmeal and good flavor. 

So would I come back? Maybe. I would probably come back for dinner to try a bit more variety."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance was nice. Servers were attentive and friendly. For those who want Paella & Octopus, make sure you order those first because they take up to 45-60 mins to make. Loved the Guava and Pear Sangria. They have a great menu for sharing/ family style."}
{"text":"Had Oysters, Fried Pork Belly, Grilled Octopus, Asado (Ribeye), Lobster Salad, passable desserts. Ambience was good. 

Oysters are oysters but for some reason, this had a significantly saltier taste than average. I know you just shuck oysters and serve it, but it seriously tasted like I had the ocean in my mouth, that's how salty they were, didn't end up finishing the last 3. 

Fried pork belly was just that, fried pork belly and not much else. Reminds of the stuff you can get in a Chinese BBQ Stand or Filipino restaurant. Actually had it sent back cause it was too salty. 

Lobster Salad was great, highly recommend, came with papaya and avocado. I was checking to see if the papaya was sweet and ripe, and it was. 

Grilled octopus was also great quality wise. Standard flavour though, nothing with a significant flair that would be memorable. 

The Asado was also very salty. But I wasn't going to send back two dishes on that account. If you want steak, go to a steak house, this isn't the place for it. 

The desserts were eh. I'm told they were all made in house, but the churros were really uninspiring and the Chocolate Hazelnut is basically Nutella. You should expect the Churros at a MINIMUM to be on point. Also had another chocolate dessert that was again, ok, but nothing special. I made the comment it was something you could get at the Grocery Store from President's choice. The manager on duty came and gave us a complimentary dessert which was the toast, and done so because of our earlier experience with the food. The toast is recommended above the Churros. 

That being said, service was pretty good. Manager was courteous in asking for feedback and compensating with something else, and our server was good except for neglecting water refills. Manager handled the basics, the server did not. 

Food - 1 1/2 Stars
Service - 4 1/2 Stars

I would come back at least once more just on the basis of service and to try the Paella."}
{"text":"Should have paid more attention to the 1 - 2 star reviews... I was excited to come for their Monday Special ($40 for paella and 1/2pitcher of sangria) but it was a DISAPPOINTING experience tonight. I can sum up tonight as: overpriced, poor service and no quality. 

Ordered a couple of things tonight, and not one dish impressed me at all. I understand tapas are at a smaller portion, but at this quality and price... I'm going to list them out from worst to better.
- Grilled calamari ($12): This was recommended by the server and it was the WORST decision!! It tasted burnt and extremely SALTY. We had to send it back to the kitchen for a remake, and the second one wasn't burnt but just as SALTY.
- Double bone marrow ($16): There was plenty of bread (6+ slices) but the two bone BARELY had anything to scape off... I actually mentioned it to the server but was brushed off by serving us water. NOT WORTH.
- Dozen of oysters ($34): They have two choices which were west or east coast so we got half and half. The oysters basically didn't taste very fresh and a couple of the oysters were TINY - bigger than a quarter coin...
- Paella Tapasgria (Monday special price at $40): The portion was great to share. There just wasn't much taste to it and some of the rice even tasted undercooked. Mussels were small, shrimps were good, that ONE clam, chicken was extremely dry and the sausage was good. It was just a big pan of disappointment
- Spanish meatball ($10): It came with 5 meatballs, topped off with some tomato sauce and cheese. Tasted good but then the meatballs were room temperature with steaming sauce over it... 
- Grilled skirt steak ($7): There was about 6 slices of steak. Again, decent but overpriced. 
- Foie gras pate ($10): This was decent actually but extremely overpriced... foie gras on two small slices of bread with some mango sauce on top

The server was very nonchalant over our dining experience. He only asked us 'how's the food' after we told him about the salty grilled calamari. 

I gave this a 2 star place since they do a good job with the ambiance and the decor. The seating is spacious and comfortable, and I do like the open kitchen concept... they also make decent sangria, so maybe their drinks are worth a try? 

All in all, would I come back? No."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago to celebrate a friend's birthday. I really enjoyed my first visit at this new uptown Spanish tapas restaurant located in Markham where go4tea used to be! There is a pretty good selection of hot and cold tapas and pintxos to choose from, but in the end we decided to try the grilled octopus, double roasted bone marrow, paella de mariscos; and shared a pitcher of the original sangria.

It was my first time trying this stuff but I must say, the bone marrow was very delicious. It was served with 3 slices of toast and was overall very flavourful, buttery, and probably one of my highlights of the night. Octopus was quite flavourful and chewy as well. The overall presentation of the paella was quite great and quite tasty with decent amounts of seafood. The portions are okay for sharing. Rice had a pretty good al dente texture. For dessert I tried the creme catalana. The creme catalana was not my favourite as the custard was little too liquidy and the lemon zest flavour was a little too strong. I have heard great things about the Spanish toast though which was also recommended by the waitor so will try it next time :)

Overall the ambience was awesome with a great vibe. It is very spacious with comfortable seating areas, dimly lit with brick walls, good music and nice decor. (Would be cool if it had Gaudi vibe too). The waiters were very helpful and friendly and surprised my friend with a birthday cake on the house!

Overall I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Nice Spanish food for the area. The bone marrow is amazing as most of the tapas.  Service could have been better. Very nice atmosphere. 
Decent wine selection.  I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out some Spanish food in the GTA area and see if it compares to the food I had in Spain. My friend's boyfriend chose this restaurant for our dinner get together aka his interrogation.

We ordered a bunch of things to share. The first thing that came was the angus tartare ($10 for two pieces). I thought it was seasoned quite well. There was quite a bit of beef on the piece of bread. For $5 a piece, it was quite expensive. 

Next, I tried the salmon pate ($5 for two pieces). I really liked this dish because it was very creamy and flavourful. I think it tasted better than the angus tartare. 

The salted cod croquetas ($13 for 4 pieces) and fried anchovies ($6) were both salty and not memorable.

The last thing that came was the paella de mariscos ($52). This does take a while to make so it's suggested that you order that first. This is a definite must get. There was a nice variety of seafood in the dish. My friend complained that the rice was too hard but I think the rest of the table enjoyed it. The portion was good enough for four people.

Lastly, we got 3 desserts to share. We got churros, crema catalana and a Spanish French toast. The churros were the best. It was crunchy and done well. I just wish there was more chocolate sauce. The crema catalana was the least liked because of its gritty texture. The Spanish French toast was ok. The majority of the table found it too sweet but I thought it was okay. 

Overall, I enjoyed this restaurant but I can't come here often because of the price."}
{"text":"First time coming to this eatery with family. First impressions are good. this establishment has nice brick walls with high ceilings. The restaurant area is very spacious and comfortable. I feel like the lighting could use some work because it is rather dim. the open kitchen concept is nicely paired with an extensive bar space. the wait staff was assertive and helpful. the washrooms have a bottle of Listerine in case you wanna freshen up lolz. all that stuff is cool .. but ultimately it comes down to the food. the menu is quaint & designed evenly. The only tidbit issue with the menu - There are no pictures of food references. We tried some tapas dishes which were very flavorful, especially the spicy octopus. We ordered one of their signature paella dishes. these dishes take a minimum of 45 minutes to cook , so I would suggest putting an order in once you get seated if you are planning to try it. The food quality is nice, the presentation of the food is nice. The flavor of the food is nice . but..  the one major let down.. if you are coming here tight on time , do not come here !! The restaurant is only half full right now & they cannot keep up with the orders. I see many tables of people waiting for food & nothing on their tables. the extra long wait times for food is a big killer on dining experience morale. with only 3 or 4 cooks servicing a restaurant of an estimated 200 plus seats, if you are looking to have a quick meal.. Forget about it !! the food takes forever to come. there is only so much coffee or water you can drink before you manage to ask a waiter. Is it ready yet ? other than that, my overall first experience here was a pleasant one.. the restaurant offered us free dessert after an extremely long wait for the paella. I'm not entirely sure if I will come back , but with so few limited options to eat Spanish food in the Markham richmond hill area. this place does offer good food at reasonable prices and probably great drinks.. But since I don't drink , I will never know =) if the kitchen staff was able to prepare food at a more efficient speed without sacrificing food quality , this place can easily be a 4 star rating. happy eats everyone =)"}
{"text":"Overall, food is delightful but I find the mediocre service really ruined the experience.
We came on a Monday night for casual celebration. Restaurant was mostly empty but all 3 servers saw us (they didn't have a dedicated hostess), were all not actively holding anything or with a customer, looked at each other and no one wanted to come grab us. The one that eventually come, rolled her eyes at her coworker before greeting us.
I also found the table disgustingly sticky to the point I didn't feel comfortable putting my phone on it. I reached over to the table beside us and found the same stickiness on surfaces people would eat on (not sticky in the sides or between seats).
Our server also had no intention of letting us know the daily special, making recommendations or any service you'd expect for a similar establishment.
Sub par service aside, their food was overall quite delicious.
We ordered Foie Gras Pate Toast, Roasted Bone Marrow, Cured Iberico Ham and the Monday $40 Special of half pitcher Sangria and House Paella. THERE WAS A LOT OF BREAD...almost everything came with bread and we probably wouldn't have ended up with this menu if our server made recommendations.
Sangria was light and fruity. I saw a very extensive sangria offering so I was bummed you couldn't sub the choice for extra $$.
Foie gras toast was quite good. The pate was rich, creamy with mild gamey notes. The dollop of berry jam gave it some depth of sweetness and tartness to cut the fat.
Roasted bone marrow was the highlight of our night. From the marrow to the oil, it's indulgence at its finest. The bread soaked up all the fatty goodness. It tasted like a heart attack.
The Iberico ham was a huge let down. $24 gets you a very small plate so I was expecting the ham to blow my mind. It was soft and flavourful, but nothing special. It tasted comparable to your usual  charcuterie offering so I definitely felt I should have gotten something else.
House paella was delicious - musky saffron and paprika with a medley of meats and seafood. I noticed not all the proteins were listed on the menu, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the chicken and octopus.
We also got dessert: Spanish toast. It taste like a weird cousin of french toast, the bread had a mild cheesy taste with a sticky sugar top. It was light but I'm not huge on it.
All in all, great food with up scale prices but you'd get better service at a Swiss Chalet hands down."}
{"text":"Would come back to try other dishes. Dishes I would order again: angus tartare (that truffle though!!) and sardines. Sooo guuuuud. 

octopus app was meh. skirt steak was okay. i came for the paella but the menu said it would take 45mins which would have made us late for deadpool. not really many carb rich items on the menu otherwise so i was a bit disappointed on that department. 

server was kinda off.. she didn't know how to describe/sell the food items properly so we didnt have much guidance on the dishes before we tried them first hand. overall good experience. was pretty empty and the tvs were turned off not sure why. i still miss gofortea."}
{"text":"I love this place. I really do. 

I went to Tapagria on Monday for dinner and it did not fail to impress. You walk in and get transported to good ole Spain. The decor was clean and rustic.

We were there for an early dinner to bypass the dinner rush. On Monday's they have a paella and half a sangria for $40 - considering the prices of a paella, you're really getting free sangria! 

Their menu is double sided so make sure you flip the page to see their set meals if you're unsure of what to order. They have a good variety of cold and hot tapas for a reasonable price ( comparing prices in Barcelona) and they were very well done.

We had about 6 people in the group and ordered a few items. 

Caesar salad was good. Slightly salty from the overload of anchovies but it wasn't overly creamy which is nice.

The hot tapas:
Spanish meatballs were tasty. There were maybe a dozen small meatballs in the dish covered with marinara sauce and a nice layer of mozzarella cheese. Well seasoned.

The cod fritters were a meh for me. It comes with 4 fritters and it taste more like potato than fish. It's crispy on the outside, very soft on the inside: slightly bland. Not the bigger fan.

Chili rapini was amazing. Very garlicky and not spicy at all.

Skirt steak was made very well. The sauce was tangy and fresh, served with a side of chips to gobble it up. The steak was tender and flavorful.

We also ordered the mussels which had mounds of garlic and juicy fat mussel meat. 

Fried calamari was battered just right. Crisp and light, served with an alioli.

The sangria was more fruit than wine, which fit my taste buds.

Last but not least the paella. O m g. The paella was so good! Chunks of chicken, chorizo and seafood that sent me back to my week in Barcelona. Do not skip out on it!!

This is a place I would go again no questions asked!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

*There were two kitchens, one I assume was for cured meats/cold tapas and the other one was for hot food. 

*the price point of this restaurant is expensive compare to Markham's standard, but not at downtown Toronto at all. These dishes were tapas so the price will add up, thus do check the menu prior to going because this ain't going to be a cheap meal.

-Apparent Sour (Aperol, St.Germain, Lime Juice) - $12
in term of taste, it was the closest drink to a Whisky Sour. The drink had just enough lime juice to make a counterpoint to the St.Germain, and hint of sweetness from the Aperol to take the edge off the lime

-Foie Gras Pate (truffle oil, mango) - $10
I freak out everytime I see truffle oil on the menu. It is so pungent that if the chef is not careful with it, the oil would overpower everything on the plate. With that said, I liked how they held back on the oil and the pate was smooth and creamy, almost silky to the tongue.

-Fried Anchovies - $6
The anchovies were lightly battered, deliciously seasoned and topped with a house made sauce. Some people might think this is a tad bit salty, but I liked it that way and this would be perfect with a nice cold glass of beer.

-Salt Cod Croquetas - $10
Surprisingly enough the croquetas were not salty at all! It was a tad too dry for me and I didn't taste that distinguish salty, fishy flavor of cod. I can't remember what was the sauce underneath but it added a nice kick of heat to the croquetas.

-Roasted Bone Marrow - $12
Though the bone marrow at Black Hoof is a bit more expensive, it was way much more substantial as the one at Tapagria barely had any \"meat\" in it. I ended up scraping some of the sauce and herbs onto my bread and the flavor was pretty good! Very buttery and oily, in a good way.

-Hamachi Crudo - $14
Though I appreciated how they kept the fish pure and simple with a few ingredients, the cut of the fish was quite thick and it didn't feel fresh at all. With that said, I liked that there was just a right amount of red chilies for heat and a few julienne slices of granny apple smith to counterpart the spices.

-Smoked Eggplant (sour cream, tomato) - $5
the eggplant had a really strong smoky taste and other ingredients in the dish didn't help to offset that either. However I was surprised to see how sweet the tomato was as it was almost like eating candy.

-Special of the day: seared scallop with parsley and butter sauce with escarole - $21
Nothing makes me more happy than seeing a perfectly seared and glistening scallop... The scallop was buttery, semi-sweet and melted in your mouth goodness. I don't remember what was the puree underneath, but it complimented the scallop perfectly without overwhelming it.

-Paella de Tapagria (shrimp, chorizo, hen, mussels, jamon, octopus, peas) - $45
the paella takes 45 minutes to prepare, so I would suggest that you order this first.
The rice was too mushy and there was no crispy bottom, aka. soccarat. All the components tasted great on its own but together as a whole, the paella was a bit dull and bland in my opinion. I also felt the flavor of the seafood and chorizo didn't get to seep into the rice, and a bit more seasoning would have given this paella that magical oomph.

*SECRET MENU* Mega Dessert Platter - $30 (included all dessert items on the menu)
-Crème Catalana
The custard had a rich and creamy texture with a nice slightly-burnt sugar on the surface that had a nice crack once you tap on it. Although there was some caramelized orange zests (?) on the side to cut the richness of the custard, I thought the custard could have been more flavorful if some spices or lemon zest was incorporated in the mix.

-Spanish Toast
If you have a sweet tooth, you will LOVE this dessert as it was devoured by the three of us instantly. For the Spanish Toast, I believe the brioche bread was soaked in either custard or milk (it should be the latter), then pan-fried with butter and served with dulce de leche. The end result is an amazing toast with a crispy skin on the outside and the inside just ooze out like milk!

-Churros with house sauce
Is there anything better than cinnamon sugar fried dough served with a dulce de leche sauce?! 

-Pastel de Chocolate
the cake had a layer of moose in between the sponge cake whereas the previous one didn't. The sponge cake this time was less dry and dense, and the moose really helped to lighten up the cake. I also appreciated that they added more blueberry sauce which provided the much needed acidity to cut the richness of the cake."}
{"text":"Great variety and so flavourful. Prices are very reasonable. Amazing cocktails  I got the passion fruit and fig. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ate near the area a few weeks prior and noticed that Go For Tea was no more but replaced by a Spanish tapas restaurant which got me intrigued. Finally got a chance to check out Tapagria and for the most part, it's what I had expected for a tapas joint.

Came on a Saturday evening during dinner time this past weekend and I was surprised at how quiet it was for such a large restaurant. I made reservations just in case as I wasn't sure as to what to expect with regards to wait times though. The dining and kitchen areas are all in an open concept space, so you can kinda see the kitchen as they prepare your meals. 

My only gripe with the restaurant initially was that while my lady & I were taken care of quickly initially, service seemed to have forgotten about us after we were seated and asked for our choice of drinks. A server had to be flagged down in order to place our orders despite the quiet evening in the restaurant. 

We had the following:
Jamon wrapped dates - $8
Grilled Skirt Steak - $8
Steamed Mussels -$6
Roasted Bone Marrow (on special at the time - 2 for $16 vs 1 for $12)
Artisanal Meat Selection (small size) - $16
Angus Tartare - $10
Foie Gras Pate - $10
Dessert Platter - $not on the menu! 

...and honestly I was not disappointed with our selection! Highlights of our choices personally had to be the Jamon wrapped dates and the Angus Tartare, with the bone marrow in third. Only thing to note about the bone marrow was that I felt that the 2nd piece which we had paid for due to the special was noticeably smaller than the first...

And the dessert platter! It's a secret menu item not on the restaurants main menu, and our server told us that we had to place the order as how the actual platter is named, not just \"secret dessert platter\" (google or another reviewer will help you out with this haha. Also not sure if she was just trolling me either haha) but it was worth the quick internet search! You get the following: 
- A slice of chocolate cherry cake (which was rich while not overbearingly sweet)
- The freshest, best-fried churros I've ever had (nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) served with dulce de leche 
- Spanish toast with dulce de leche on the side
- A tart of some sort (forgot the actual name for it unfortunately)

The dessert platter would make anyone reach for a pillow and couch immediately! 

I'd love to come back and I hope that Tapagria sticks around as it's a welcome local alternative to heading downtown for Spanish eats."}
{"text":"Finally some variety amongst a sea of Asian restaurants!  

Came here last Fri with some friends for dinner.  This place was a pleasant surprise with a great ambience, great service and great food.

Loved the menu and everything tastes fantastic!

Oct 2017 update:

We came here for a family dinner earlier this week.  We had 3 vegans at our table and the waiter told us straight up that this wasn't a good place for them, as they had recently revised the menu.  We tried to make the menu work, but after 20 minutes of trying we realized it wasn't going to happen.  We ate our appetizers and unfortunately had to leave as there were no options for everyone.  Ended up at Moxies across the street instead.  Very frustrating."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something different to eat during one of our Friday date nights. Came across Tapagrias online wanting to try small plates/tapa style Spanish cuisine. Really only have 2 or 3 other tapas style Spanish cuisine as a basis of comparison. The food was just average. We ordered 7 items and only enjoyed 2 out of the 7 dishes - the jamon wrapped dates and the Spanish toast. The truffle fries, though it looked appetizing wasnt that tasty, while the chorizo sausage was very dry. For two people, our meal ended up costing around $100.
We might consider coming back again to try other items - ie. Foie gras and bone marrow. And of course the paella."}
{"text":"A decent addition to the Richmond Hill East corridor. They've made a modern, large and inviting space here. It's a welcome addition to the growing diversity of cuisines in the area. Service is good and food is decent. 3.5* stars."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 1 STAR FOR TERRIBLE SERVICE!! Came here with a group of 7 on Monday, so definitely it wasn't busy at all. However, after waiting for around 25 mins, there is not even one person who come to serve us any drinks and we even waved our hand in the air for 10 mins to get someone. Finally, we ordered 2 paella which is paella de tapagria and paella de carne, rib-eye steak, and a whole rack of lamb (not included in the photo). Reminder: for the paella, it takes around 45 mins to make it. All of them are yum, I personally prefer the tapagria than the carne, while the steak and lamb are very juicy and perfectly cooked. Overall, the food is worth waiting for, since you do not want them to be pre-cooked lol. BUT you need to be prepared being ignored for 30 mins without water."}
{"text":"Tried out their brunch and ordered Steak and Eggs, and a Paella. 

Steak was very delicious and done just right. Ordered Medium and it was actually medium, very juicy and well seasoned. Quantity was a bit...lacking. The eggs were just...eggs. Nothing special, no seasoning, just eggs. Came with kale salad which was very fresh and good quantity. 

Paella was just like everyone's experience. Tiniest portion of Paella in the world, it was tasty but seafood content was a bit sad. Bits of octopus, a shrimp sliced in half, pebble sized mussel that was not too fresh. However it all tasted great but not filling at all. 

Service was so so, when we arrived the handicapped door switch was not working so struggling to get through with a stroller was not a good first impression. No one was at the front to greet us and we waited a minute until someone from the bar noticed we were standing. 

Ambience was nice, however music was being played a bit loud/noisy but the sound quality was horrid, sounded like something wasn't plugged in properly. 

Overall, it's a great restaurant however portions need to be a tad more generous so people actually leave happy and full."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It is definitely a nice addition in Markham for Spanish tapas if you don't want to travel all the way downtown! It replaced what used to be Go For Tea up on Commerce Valley.

Tapas are great for sharing... the more people you have, the more you can try! Their booths are quite spacious and comfy! But if you're not at a booth, seats can get a bit crowded on the floor. Servers couldn't past through without annoyingly swiping your chair/jacket. My major pet peeve.

Tapagria IS on the expensive side... so prepare to slurge! Typically $40-50 per person for food and drinks. Food are hit and miss. Service is, however, very attentive and friendly.

Note** If you are ordering the paella, order it right when you sit down. It takes 45 mins to make. Make sure you order the seafood one! The paella de Tapagria is too bland for my liking.

Items you must try:
- Paella de Mariscos (seafood)
- Bacon wrapped dates
- Salted cod croqueta 
- Lobster salad
- Jamon de Iberico
- Spanish toast *must order* save room!!!

Items I have dilemmas with lol:
- Angus tartare... very tasty but $10 for 2 pieces!
- Sangria... huge selection of red and white. They are SO refreshing and tasty but is it not worth $30+ a pitcher?? :/

Items you can skip:
- Paella de Tapagria (meats)... get the seafood one!
- Grilled octopus... octopus itself is too bland
- Pork belly... if you're Asian, you've had better ??
- Kale califlower salad... quite salty

That's my 2 cents for Tapagria. This place certainly have potential. Keep up the good work, I will be back to try again soon!"}
{"text":"Overall I would say this was an okay experience.

The space is beautiful and our server was really friendly and efficient. Food wise, it was just mediocre. 

Had seared foie gras, roasted bone marrow, clams and chorizo, grilled calamari, and the paella de tapagria. Nothing outstanding.  As noted by other yelpers the portions are really small.  The clams were $13 and I think I got 8 clams in the whole dish.  The grilled calamari was mushed in a chunky sauce, I could hardly distinguish the sauce from the calamari.  Paella and bone marrow were good. And the most delicious was the seared foie: but how can you really go wrong with that? 

I probably won't be returning. The atmosphere and server were great, but I don't think the food is good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"My family comes here often to eat Spanish tapas. Their food is always good, service is decent, and the environment is great for business discussion or hanging out with friends. 

Food favourites: 
- cauliflower kale: one of the few items that have remained on the menu since the beginning. Kale is super healthy- makes me feel better about myself before eating a feast here! Kale is usually bitter but they somehow make it taste really good!
- anything octopus or squid: spicy octopus is my favourite, but their marinated squid, and Mediterranean octopus are definitely also above average.
- roasted bone marrow: sooooo good. It's a bit salty, so you have to eat it with the bread, spread it across evenly. This is one of the very few places that make it, and they do so fairly well. 
- rib steak: very tasty, impressively cooked for such a large cut. This is a large format steak meant to share. Steak was so tender and juicy but too bad the corn was too buttery for my taste.
- SPANISH TOAST: this is actually one of my favourite things to eat ever. I'm not really a dessert person when going out for dinner but this honestly is so amazingly good. The torched caramelized sugar on top gives it a really enjoyable burnt caramel taste. It is best eaten with a bit of the fruit, fresh cream and the Spanish toast all together in one bite. 

Service was decent, although a bit slower this time a went as it was fairly busy, although they are always really friendly and accommodating to my nut allergies. Usually service is pretty fast. Decor is rlly nice with a modern Spanish flair. They have custom made ceiling decor with nice finished wooden tables.

This will definitely remain one of my family go-to places for a nice weekend dinner!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere and service were good but i would say the food is only okay."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for for dinner and was told the set meal is the best deal offering some of the most popular dishes. Good deal maybe, but we were not impressed with the dishes. 

For $199, we got about 19 dishes with a paella Tapagria. Starting with the cigars and caesar salad, both were just meh. The squid and meat balls arrived shortly after but the squid was overly chewy and the meatballs were on the dry side.  With in a minute or two, we got the beef tartare, shrimps, tomatoes, foie gras and fries (limp and soggy).  We couldn't eat all the food fast enough! I felt like they could of time it a bit better so we can enjoyed 2 dishes at a time.  The paella arrived last and was probably the best dish of the night. 

Overall, we were not impressed with taste of the food. We thought at that price level, they need to up their game.  The service however was great, our waitress was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"New place and it was delicious! A little expensive but that's to be expected for tapas. We were a group of 3 that ordered 3 tapas and a paella. 

We started off with a tropical sangria. GET IT. Its mango and lychee. No regrets. $31

Salmon pate $5 was so damn good. It comes with 2 pieces and it was deeeelicious! 
Bone marrow $12 was surprisingly good. My first time eating it and it was just enough for a taste. Very flavourful. 
Grilled calamari $10 was pretty good. Melted in your mouth, so it wasn't chewy. 
Shared a paella de tapagria $45 and it was just enough to share after the tapas. 

My first time trying paella and it was so good, I'd come back just for the rice. It has a good amount of seafood and meat. After the 3 tapas and paella, I was sufficiently full. 

But of course we had to get dessert. We tried the platter $30 for all 4 desserts: creme brulee, churros, chocolate cake and Spanish toast. 

I would only recommend the Spanish toast for an experience that you would never forget. It's so good! Churros were not bad. The other two I could go without.

Staff was great -- Tommy was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. 

Would definitely come back -- I think there's a great deal on Mondays -- a jug of sangria and paella for $40. DO IT."}
{"text":"2.5 rounded up to three for ambiance. This beautiful restaurant seems to always empty and I think I know why now. Reminiscent of a hip, downtown spot, Tapagria just doesn't fit in with its surrounding area. I love the idea of a Spanish tapas restaurant in my neighborhood but the prices just won't sit well in a neighborhood flooded with amazing bargain eats. 

We were lucky enough to go on buck a shuck Tuesday's where oysters were a dollar a piece. The oysters were fresh and tasty. 

The next few items were so tiny and not worth the money at all. We had the Spanish meatballs, which, while yummy, weren't overly special, it came with 5 decently sized meatballs for $10, the flank steak which was about 4 inches long for $12, the patatas bravas, which were probably the best tasting item, but a too small portion for the $6 it cost. We also had grilled calamari and sangria. We ordered churros for dessert and they were quite delicious, our server even threw in an extra one because they only come in a portion of 4.

The food was just ok, and all 6 of our party agreed, had the prices been slashed in half, we would have left here happy, and full. We all wanted to go to McDonald's after this costly experience that didn't even fill us up. 

Our server was nice but we all found she had a bit of attitude, almost like we were annoying her. 

The restaurant itself is beautifully designed, high ceilings, unique light fixtures and and a great open concept kitchen makes up for some of the misgivings of this place. It's inviting and warm and they play Spanish music that makes you feel like you're on vacation. 

Overall, I don't think I'll be back unless they make changes to their pricing to be more competitive with the neighborhood. The portions are too small for the prices and the \"sharing plates\" aren't big enough to share."}
{"text":"First time trying Spanish tapas, kind of disappointing to be honest 

Their appetizers were really good especially the calamari was soft but tender enough to chew and the sourness of the sauce balanced out the oiliness, the truffle fries was super good too!!! *fries is life*  but the portion was a bit small for me personally even though I don't consider myself as a big eater 

HOWEVER!! the main dish Pealla de Tapagria wasn't as good as I expected from their pictures or reviews...and I forgot to take picture of it 

It worths to come for a one time experience or special occasions but I would say a bit expensive to come just for a weekend dinner"}
{"text":"Only a baby shower brunch for a friend would have me heading North to Markham on a sunny Saturday at Tapagria!

The shower host had booked one of the private rooms in the restaurant - it was the perfect size and beautifully decorated.

We were offered sangria (boozy and non-boozy).  I opted for the non-boozy and it was delish...very refreshing, tangy with hints of grapefruit.

Once our guest of honor arrived, we ordered from the Tapagria brunch menu.  I went with the Huevos Benedict - it came with 2 poached eggs atop an English muffin and serrano ham with a small kale salad on the side.  Great dish but paled in comparison to the dish that was ordered next to me - the Farmers Plate - which came with ample meats (maple bacon and sausages - I think 4 pieces each) plus potatoes, salads and eggs!  What a feast!

While waiting for our brunch meals, Tapagria brought us some complimentary salted cod croquetas to try which were delightfully deep-fried.

Our meal ended with a spectacular wooden board of desserts - churros with dipping sauce, cheese cake, and Spanish French Toast!

Service was super friendly and engaging.  Our two waiters kept our sangria and water glasses full and were attentive to personal food allergies.

Happily recommend for brunch in the area and will have to come back to try the dinner tapas menu!"}
{"text":"Tapagria provides some very \"standard\" tapas. But I don't think this is a good thing. Everything tasted decent/good, but there was no WOW factor that makes me want to come here over and over again.

My table ordered several dishes of cold and hot tapas that the server recommended. 

The good:
-Jamon Wrapped Dates: Probably the most unique and tasty dish we ordered. It was sweet from the dates and savoury from the bacon.
-Roasted Bone Marrow: I thought this was nicely done. It was very \"buttery\" feeling which goes well with the bread provided. But there wasn't a lot of bone marrow for the amount of bread they gave (not a huge deal but I would have loved to have more).
-Pintxo Trio: This was the most similar to the tapas I have had in Barcelona. 3 pieces of bread with toppings including foie pate, smoked eggplant, and avocado jamon. I liked the foie pate one, but I was told the smoked eggplant had a funny taste.
-Both their desserts were really good! The Spanish Toast was like a creme brulee, and the churros were nicely fried.

The average:
-Spanish meatballs: I don't know why this is on the menu (but we ordered it anyways ha!). It's so....AVERAGE! It was just tiny meatballs covered in tomato sauce and cheese. Nothing special. It didn't taste bad or anything, but....why???
-Spicy octopus: Octopus with a tomato-like sauce that is slightly spicier than the meatball one. Again, it wasn't like it tasted bad, but it was not memorable.
-Grilled calamari: average. Like any other and made like any other.
-Tender steak fillet: Steak with caramelized onion and (I think) fried taro crisps. It was decent but, (again), not memorable.
-Paella De Tapagria: I was excited for this because they said it takes 45 minutes to prepare. Even so, it came out \"just warm\". It looked pretty good and tasted alright.

Maybe I'm just super picky. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things. Standard can be good, but I was really hoping for some transformative, unique, \"sophisticated\" tapas (yeah, who am I?!?!). Nothing in particular in the menu stood out. But hey, everything tasted pretty decent.

As for service, staff were friendly. We asked for some recommendations but the server did not sell the tapas very well. I don't usually expect servers to know every ingredient in a dish, but it would have been nice if she gave us some idea about what the dishes are like. 

...Or maybe she didn't have to, cause I guess you can't really go into much detail about meatballs."}
{"text":"Happy new years to everyone reading this! I came here last night to ring in the new year and  take advantage of the prix fixed menu (45 dollars). Everything tasted good but I didn't find the tapas memorable.  The real stand out was my main entree, the Angus tenderloin and my dessert the Spanish toast.  The meat was incredibly tender,  the rapini had a beautiful char and the Chocolate jus tied everything together perfectly. I ate that up and wished for seconds. For dessert I contemplated between churros and the Spanish toast. Being a churro lover it was a hard decision but thank god I went with the Spanish toast because I have never had anything like it. A custard brioche brulée with berries, dulce de Leche and a citrus whip cream. It was like a cross between french toast and creme brulee! Amazing! Unfortunately my boyfriends had ways to much custard making his dish way too rich but mine was perfect. I will be back for more!

P.s ask for the hot sauce it's fire!"}
{"text":"I came here Sunday night with my family to see what the hype was all about. It's nice that they opened a downtown style type of restaurant uptown.

ANGUS TARTARE ($10)
this came in 2 pieces, it was a big chunk of tartare. it was ok, nothing special and i didnt really like the flavor.

GRILLED CALAMARI ($12)
Nothing special, i didn't like the presentation of this dish as it looked all messy.

HAMACHI CRUDO ($14)
so they said they didnt have hamachi in house and serving ahi tuna instead. the tuna was half black colored mixed into its original red, which is horrible because it means the fish was not fresh! We told our waitress and gladly they took it off our bill. I'd hope so, considering it was $14 for 5 pieces.

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($22)
this was my favorite dish of the night. The Foie gras was seared nicely, texture of it was really good was well. Quite expensive for just one piece, but I definitely enjoyed it.

GRILLED SKIRT STEAK ($8)
Surprisingly this came with quite a few slices - the meat however was tough and chewy though. Nothing special.

PAELLA DE MARISCOS ($52) serving size 2-4 people
bomba rice served with lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and peas. This dish had a lot of ingredients, which was nice. lots of seafood but I can't believe they forgot the most important thing, the lobster! When the dish was served we kept digging to try and find pieces of lobster. We even asked the waitress and she agreed she didn't see any. She then came back with a side dish of extra lobster. One thing I found strange was some pieces of shrimp was slit in half, easy to pull from the shells but some were served as a whole - inconsistency. The rice was really flavorful, tastey.

GALLINA CON AJO Y HIERBAS ($24) - the roasted cornish hen
The hen was roasted nicely, however a little dry, There was flavor in the chicken meat which was good. The skin had a slight crisp as well. I enjoyed this dish, but I would have liked the chicken more if it was juicy.

Not sure if its because its still new so there's still some room for improvement, or maybe the atmosphere just made me have higher expectations? But I just expected more so was pretty disappointed with my visit. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but it's just nothing special and not worth the price imo. Service is good though!"}
{"text":"Very surprised with how good it was here. Went on Friday night, their first weekend and it was packed! We ordered mainly from hot tapas part of the menu. Their lobster salad, chorizo and clams, foie gras and mussels were my favourites! We got two orders of the foie gras, it's a must when you go! Service was great, dim industrial atmosphere, amazing Food! Will definitely be going here more often."}
{"text":"I've been to Tapagria twice now and been impressed by the food, service and atmosphere. 

I did have s few mixed drinks (Caesar and Bees Knees) that were not my favourite (Caesar was very heavy on worcestershire sauce and Bees Knees tasted of vodka rather than the promised gin). 

Pros: great tapas; good selection; great ambiance; good selection of mixed drinks; prompt, friendly service

Cons: somewhat pricey (especially if you want to try a number of items); mixed drinks were not well prepared

Recommended: fried chicken; kale and cauliflower; oysters; Spanish meatballs; paella (amazing)

I would absolutely recommend but be prepared to spend $50 to $70 per person (particularly with drinks) to get the full experience. This isn't horribly expensive as this is a more upscale experience and is certainly well worth it."}
{"text":"This review is primarily based on the lunch menu and not the dinner family style entrees...

All lunch entrees come with soup of the day... +1.

There are many paella's and pasta dishes to choose from.  I chose the seafood paella and my friends chose others to give the menu a whirl...  the soup of the day was a cream of mushroom... sounded nice, smelled a-ok especially with the few drops of truffle oil to finish... then the taste was... a let down. The soup was very thin and appeared to be watered down as there was very little seasoning to be had... even with the added fresh cracked pepper, it was still rather bland.  The entrees came and the wait staff had to ask everyone what they ordered to be plated... they don't have a proper ordering by seat system...  they had an extra carne paella and I was missing my seafood paella and they tried to tell me I ordered the extra paella and was incessantly pushing me to take it but I know what I ordered...  hind sight, maybe I should of taken the carne dish... 15 mins later my right order comes out but the shrimps had no sweetness, the clam was a bit too mushy... the squid was a pass... the rice was meh... all my friends shared the same thought and it looks great but with the other competition around...they have a long road ahead"}
{"text":"Prepare to empty your wallet here for their delicate tapas and fancy dishes. 

Lovely decor, very modern and comfortable. Perfect for a date or a family gathering. Their menu is pretty clear and concise. After our server had settled us in with a bottle of red, she immediately asked if we were planning to order paella since it'll take 40mins. That was a nice gesture however, it was kind of odd when she left my friend in an awkward silence and gave him a strange stare with an \"are-you-kidding me?\" look on her face when he asked what paella was. (Um..rude?) Thankfully, I knew and saved us from the tensuion and awkwardness... Anyway, here's what we ordered:

- Angus Tartare: Flavour, flavour, FLAVOUR! A good portion of meat served. Very tender and fresh. Every bite will get your tastebuds dancing and I ain't exaggerating.

- Seared Foie Gras: PHENOMENAL! The foie gras melts in your mouth like butter and that pairing of sweetness provokes an organsm in your mouth. OUF! This bad boy is such a tease... you've been warned. 

- Foie Gras Pâté: Very similar in taste to the seared foie gras. The savoury and sweetness combo is still here. Only difference is that the foie gras isn't buttery in taste but rather smooth and \"creamy\". 

- Venison Carpaccio: Similar to beef tataki but more gamy in taste. Don't know how else I can describe it but nonetheless, it was tasty!

- Double Roasted Bone Marrow: If you've ever had bone marrow in the past.. it tastes just like that but with a heck ton of oil. If you haven't, it just tastes like tendon/ fat that's been overcooked and drenched in oil. Very bland as the marrow doesn't really have a taste and there wasn't much of it... I mean, it is bone marrow we're talking about here. The roasted aspect of it didn't add much to the taste.. I believe it's more for its presentation and enticement factor. 

- Artisanal Meat Selection: A variety of meats along with two dips and pickled veges. Nice little snack to munch on as a starter for your meal or at the end of your meal over a glass of wine or two.

Very impressed with the presentation and quality of food. Service was exceptional aside from that considerate gesture that turned into awkwardness. It is quite pricey here but, dining here once in awhile is acceptable."}
{"text":"3.5 star This review is based on a lunch/brunch experience. 

Tapagria is a welcome addition in Markham. This is probably the only Spanish/Tapas option in the area so I wish they will do well.

Love the set up! So spacious with the high ceiling. The deco is trendy and down to earth. 

A little disappointed with the menu as the selection is quite limited. I don't even see Churros on that? And wait staff never offer or ask us if we would like some dessert? CHURROS!

Sangrita ($9) and Spanish Coffee ($8) were quite standard. I am more interesting in their pitcher of different Sangria which I probably will try next time if I can get at least one more drinking mate.

Kale and Cauliflower ($4) and Jamon Serrano ($12). Love K & C but I think should just splurge on Jamon Iberico instead. Serrano just would not do it as it was really chewy and without that melt in the mouth wow factor.

Steak & Eggs ($18): Portion side was A-OK. I like the touch of spiciness on the potatoes. Skirt Steak cooked medium rare can be a little chewy. I will order that again if I come with a meatlover.

I already eyeing their Tuesday $1 a shuck and Monday Sangria Paella Night. I think I will be back for dinner and have some CHURROS!"}
{"text":"Kinda pricey but was very very good. Had a party of 3 and we ordered a bunch of tapas. My favourites would definitely the tuna tartar with lotus root chips, marinated octopus, and truffle fries.  My girlfriend also loved the roasted bone marrow.

Next time, I would probably only one or two tapas with a paella. It's probably better for my wallet as well."}
{"text":"The review is based on a lunch experience only.

I like Tapagria as it is a new cuisine option in the area.  I am pretty numb to the Asian and Italian offerings, so I welcome the change.  We came over for lunch on a co-worker's recommendation.  We ordered from the lunch menu.  The ingredients were really fresh.  The plating was beautiful.  The food were all boldly flavoured.  The chefs used interesting spices.  The flavouring was unique and pleasing in its own way.  Kindly note that I can't vouch for authenticity as I am not familiar with the cuisine.  

The services was outstanding and professional on our visit.  The server asked about how things were a few times.  She had no issue splitting the bill, too.

The lunch items were of regular lunch size, not of tapa size.  Strangely, there was a pasta on menu.  Among the items we ordered, the pasta's portion was the biggest; while the paella's was the smallest.  I will recommend the paella lunch item to people with small appetite only.  The piri piri hen was a good portion for most people.  All items were priced at $15 and above.

I rate Tapagria 4 stars because the food is tasty, and Spanish is a nice and unique choice in the Markham/Richmond Hill area.  The portion is acceptable for lunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I passed by this restaurant, we tried to see if this place was good. The staffs were friendly and professional, and the foods were well made and fresh. I would recommend people to try and I will come back again."}
{"text":"It's strange to find a restaurant like Tapagria in Richmond Hill- this restaurant looks like something that should've opened on King West downtown. That said, I do appreciate an extra, fancier option in this area as a contrast to the usual Asian restaurants that I frequently patronize.

For a party of 4, we ordered a bunch of tapas to share. True to tapas- standards, the portions were small, great for sharing! However seeing that most dishes range from ~$6-$12, it could add up quickly if you come with a hungry crowd.

I was most excited for the much hyped about paella. We splurged for the seafood paella ($52) with bomba rice, lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, saffron, and peas. It definitely wasn't the best paella that I've ever had, but it was delicious and satisfying nevertheless.

Desserts were a little disappointing. We shared 3 desserts, but none stood out and most of it was overly sweet. I would opt to skip next time.

But all in all, I had a good dining experience. It is a little pricey for Richmond Hill (compared to all the Chinese options around), but I would come back for special occasions."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday party last night. we ordered quite a few large portion for sharing. The place and customer service are excellent. We got both paellas on the menu ( it says take up to 45 mins but I don't think it was that long ), I prefer the MARISCOS,it has stronger flavor even though menu says lobster in it and I saw just a few. The ribeye was surprisingly delicious and I didn't expect to have such a high quality ribeye at a Spanish restaurant. We ordered the whole octopus and that was one big disappointment. It says grill but it was so tasteless i thought they broiled it and put on the grill. And it was a bit chewy too. Potatoes are pretty tasteless as well. hot tapas SALTED COD CROQUETAS, BONE MARROW and  JAMÓN WRAPPED DATES. I like the CROQUETAS, they fry it perfectly and it wasn't overcooKed. DATES was pretty good, I like the sauce and the wrap. BONE MARROW was ok, it wasn't impressive. We got the floral sangria and the guava Sangaria, it has lots of raspberry in the guava one, i recommend that. Overall I will come back again, is a nice place for girls night or date. Probably won't get the paellas."}
{"text":"Nice spot to hang out with friends. We got the huge meat platter and it was more than enough for the 6 of us. It can easily feed at least 8 people. The meat itself wasn't bad. The lamb was my favourite."}
{"text":"nice restaurant! great space but better to book on weekends! good sangria, I've tried them all, but the original is the best one. the appetizer portions are small and you have to wait 45 minutes for paella. friendly service!"}
{"text":"Over all was okay.. the atmosphere, location and service was great, the food was just okay comparing to the price.. everything taste kinda salty, but the paella was the best"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Restaurant. Their Paella is very greasy, and the assorted toasts are fishy. May be I didn't order right dishes."}
{"text":"There servers doing nothing but chatting with each other. Very awful experience. Good luck trying this restaurant. No customer services at all!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for a Birthday party with a large group (a party of 19) and opted for their family style set menu. Although the food was decent in flavour and presentation, the service was so impeccably terrible that it overshadowed the positives of the food. 

Things that went wrong: 
1. When the reservation was made, we confirmed 17 individuals and notified the manager that there would be up to 20 that may attend. We were told by the manager that we can confirm the day of when we arrive on the numbers. There was no confirmation and they served us 20 portions of food. We only found out there were 20 portions served when the bill came and we saw they charged us for 20 people. They made us pay for the 20 portions that were served, although there were only 19 of us. I understand there is a policy for family meals but there was no communication or confirmation of the numbers prior to the meal beginning. 
2. When the reservation was made, the Manager confirmed that we could have all the food on one bill, and drinks will be separate based on each person's consumption. When the bill came, our server REFUSED to split the bills. Although not a big deal, this was confirmed during the reservation that it could be done. 
3. One of us ordered 3 shots and 1 beer, the server came back with 3 beers and 1 shot and insisted that we keep the drinks (and pay for them) anyways. We had to re-order the additional shots as well. 
4. While discussing with our server about these issues, she repeatedly gave us \"the hand\" while talking and refused to listen to us and what was agreed upon with the manager during the reservation. 

I am so deeply displeased with the service, and the lack of customer service, and will likely never return. Which is unfortunate because the food is actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. I really want to like this place and have given it a few chances and am stopping. I'm going to write about my last visit. That was the best one. 

Location:
In a food plaza in Markham. Close to the 
404 and highway 7

Parking:
It's at the front of the plaza. Finding parking close to the restaurant can be really tricky. There's a tonne of parking behind. Like more parking than you will ever need. I'm a lazy git and a parking whisperer. I parked at the door. Yay.

Decor:
This place is nice. You can tell they cared about what it looks like.  It looks like it was plucked from Yorkville and place in Thornhill.  Gorgeous tiles, wood, open ceiling, large bar, great lighting. Nice!

Food:
If only the love extended to the food. Honestly this place is hit and miss with mostly misses. 

So we got the bone marrow. $18 for a whole bone cut in half  two sections and 6 tiny pieces of bread. Ok. This makes me mad. The damn hipsters. Bones are the scraps they sell for next to nothing and because it's 'cool' to eat offal we now have to pay freaking 18 bucks for a pathetic plate of scrap. 

The waitress suggested the calamari when we discovered the pork belly was out. It was a hit. Yum. Worth the get

Ok. Octopus leg. What a compete gong show. I'm still angry.  15 bucks. For. Practically.Nothing.  The 'leg' was 9 pieces of leg sitting on a piece of paper thin potato. In a sauce, can't forget that. I think it was at some point frozen, can't explain the texture. Normally ive had octopus that was Either quick cooked and  kinda chewy or long cooked and  tender. This was  chewy and mushy. Mushy. Ugg

Cauliflower and kale salad. This was a home run.  

Foie gras. Ok. 10 bucks for two pieces of spread shmeared with ground, not whole , foie. It had a mango thing on the top that was great. Also over powering. The whole bite tasted of mango, which was great because the foie spread was nothing to write home about. How do you ruin that? The bread it came on  was lovely

Meatball _ tasted good. I noticed we had 5 of them and then saw later that the table next to ours only got 4. Weird

Striploin steak. Again. Disappointed. So tiny and tough and was sliced wrong which made it even tougher to chew. Thanks guys. 

Paella. We got the tapagria paella. ( Friends wanted) The server asks you right away if you want it because it takes 45 to make. I've read in past reviews about how this was disappointing. I liked it. If we could get it like that again I would. The spice was amazing. 

Spanish toast.- server suggestion. It took over 30 minutes to get. I'm not sure why. It's a piece of mushy bread topped with a melted sugar (brule) topping, caramel and whipped cream. Disappointing small. 10 bucks for a piece of bread. Of course it was delicious. Cover anything sweet with caramel and sugar and heck yeah. But 10 dollars? Not even close to worth it especially because of the wait. 

Cost:
I rarely mention cost. I think you pay what you get for.  I can't believe I'm complaining about it but yeah, it made me angry. 

Service:
One server with someone she was training tagging along. Obviously someone who has never worked in the service industry before.

The main server was someone this establishment should never fire, in fact give her a raise. They can't afford for her to leave. This woman hustled to get people to buy more. She did a great job. She's a bit older than most that I have seen there and experience is a virtue. 

But man it was slow getting food. We were there from 5 to 8:30. There was also a guy there but apparently he was bar only, so he basically just poured wine from the bottle that the one table ordered. Hey, don't help out anywhere else..

Conclusion. 
In case you didn't get it. I'm never going back. Can't and won't recommend it"}
