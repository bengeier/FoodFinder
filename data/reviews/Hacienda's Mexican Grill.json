{"text":"I give it a 3 because it's hard to actually order something that will be good. I personally enjoy the nachos with the cochinita pibil meat. I have yet to order anything else because I've been told it isn't good. This is a place you go to when you want \"Mexican\" food and haven't found anywhere else. It isn't worth the price, especially since I used to get delicious nachos at vallarta for 5 dollars a plate and this place is in the double digits for nachos lol."}
{"text":"Well, they've only been open two weeks, so I'll cut them some slack and let them work the bugs out. First of all, the entrees were quite good. The food seems fresh and well prepared. Also, the value for the price seems good. Here are a couple of things that need improvement: 1) Tap water. Really? Also, it doesn't come automatically and we had the chips and (quite spicy) salsa for a long time before the water (which we had to ask for) arrived. 2) The salsa. Mexican places live and die on their chips and salsa and this restaurant can do better. The chips are a mix of flour and corn (why not just corn? that's what most people prefer, in my opinion) and the salsa is not chunky at all, but is instead, not that flavorful, pureed and overly hot. Doesn't fit the majority of people, for sure. Service was pretty slow and food seemed to be coming to the wrong tables (someone tried to deliver to us while we still had menus in front of us, no drinks, clearly had not ordered yet. All that said, we will try them again and hope the kinks are worked out!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs way up!!  We had the grilled avocado salad with Shrimp and it had the most amazing flavors.   Five stars for sure.  We also shared a shrimp quesadilla, also delish!  Great service too.  This place did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Love Hacienda's! Addicted to the best guacamole ever!! Getting tamales for New Year's; love this place!! Everything has been so delicious and the most wonderful staff!!"}
{"text":"I initially was thrilled after locating on yelp was given a coupon for a free appetizer. Something I had not expected. A very nice surprise. Then when we got there were seated.immediately and atmospere was fun. I mentioned the free appetizer coupon and was told \"are you sure its Hacienda. I showed her the reponse changed to okay I am going to check with the manager. She then left and came back and informed me that she couldnt find a manger, saying since we are sooooo... busy. There at the time were 10 open tables. She then ask us to come back to use the coupon again saying soo ... busy. We just ordered and tried to move passed it. She continued to bring it up 3 more times. Became very annoying. Food was fine. I had not expected a coupon and would have probably been fine with the overall experience, but I feel it is in poor taste to offer a coupon and then not honor it. Then with the waitress continually bringing it up and making excuses was unpleasent when we had not mentioned it since we first showed her and she began with excuses. So my overall rating would be average on the food, atmosphere better than average. Most employees were friendly and prompt with service but our waitress experience was poor that combined with an enticment of coupon and then nit honoring makes the experience below average."}
{"text":"Love this place.. The lamb taco's are great.  Excellent food, great quality."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Definitely better than the other Cave Creek Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Cinco de Mayo and was pleasantly surprised that \"Happy Hour\" prices were on and that meant a $3 glass of wine...so why not.

Had the grilled chicken burrito with tomatillo sauce (sauce recommended by my helpful waitress and it was spicey, mildly hot, but not over powering and just what I wanted to complement the burrito.) the combination of refried beans with grilled chicken was very flavorful and there was guacamole and sour cream on the side to enhance or cool the forkful of burrito as you choose.

For me it was a solid four to four and one half star lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and very friendly a lady that must have been the owner or manager. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very few have the Passion, dedication and attention to Freshness & Quality as we found Today at Hacienda.
We love to dine on Fine Mexican cuisine, while there are many to choose from Hacienda takes it to another level. Incredibly delicious, outstanding service beautiful patio.
Much of the ingredients are prepares freshly from scratch on site, the homemade Mole sauce is crave worthy.
Table side guacamole with fresh made Flour chips is a great way to start.
We can't wait to go Back!
Thanks Hacienda!
Simply excellent"}
{"text":"Hacienda has constantly fresh ingredients and home made tortillas. Word has caught on as the last three times I've dined there it was jam packed."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! I give the chiefs 3 thumbs up!! Margaritas are fantastic and service was explicit"}
{"text":"I thought I was eating in my favorite family restaurant in San Luis, Mexico! Excellent food; authentic taste with a current twist and all made fresh. The chips and salsa are memorable here. Excellent service; Joel was perfection! His recommendations were exactly what we wanted but just didn't know it! I had the sangria- made fresh and delicious but watch out! Don't fall in!
We will eat here again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent! Modern, upscale but also still casual Mexican food. Service is always great food delicious."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but my fiancee is.  We just moved here from the west side of the valley and decided to give this place a try.  My fiancee had the pork dish and loved it.  I went with what I know and had the chicken fajitas.  They were great.  We've been back several times (big surprise for me).  I tried to be adventurous on my last visit and got the fish tacos.  Big mistake, they weren't batter dipped and seemed oily to me.  When the waiter asked how our food was, I told him I didn't like my dish and he offered to replace it with something else.  I got a chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  We've only gone for lunch and it wasn't busy so the service was good."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!
Happy Hour and Early Bird prices are awesome. 
Secret: Their flour spinach chips are incredible. I live in San Diego and have never had any chips this good! 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"We have been there two times now and will definitely go back as it is very convenient for us. The place is nice  I cannot say I have checked it out all the way as we always gave good company and thus we are chatting away, talking about what we will eat and drink. Not noticing our surroundings very well. The menu looks good and the drinks too. 
I got the huge hot smoking margarita. Very good and very generous. 
Twice I had the fish tacos: very tasty, lots of fish, good dressing and cole slaw. Three tacos: more than enough. We never had dessert as the main course is enough. Other people had the pasta dish which was very tasty and served hot. Fried calamari was very tasty too. 
Will definitely go back. And maybe try something else. In any case the fish tacos were very consistent."}
{"text":"Green chilli sauce with Mushrooms in it??? Beyond gross. The most unauthentic Mexican food ever!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I live close and have been there twice. Each time we have had the chicken fajitas and enjoyed it.  Good potion size... should split. We have been visited at our table several times by manager or owner asking if every thing is all right. They are really trying to provide good food and service."}
{"text":"Angel waiter is the best. Food is awesome. And margaritas are good. Happy hour is good deal"}
{"text":"OK, I can't believe we ending up going back to this restaurant! The only reason we did, was because we had family in town during the holidays and we tried to go to 3 other restaurants that were all too busy, before we settled on this one. We thought maybe it would be alright since we only wanted to get an appetizer and drinks. We were wrong! The service is so beyond bad it's ridiculous! There were 6 of us, we ordered drinks and 2 appetizers. The waiter came back to the table 4 times before we all had our drinks. Then we had to ask if we were going to get our appetizer because honestly, I think he forgot. The service was pathetic! Definitely, don't waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood!  I have visited at least 1/2 dozen times for lunch dinner and happy hour. Family owned EXCELLENT food and service every time!  Have had  several dishes from the menu and all were fantastic.  Staff is attentive and chef is tweaking the menu just right."}
{"text":"We wanted this place to be good since it is close to home.  Perhaps we made bad food choices or it could have been an off night but we were very disappointed.  The fish tacos had tiny chunks of greasy seasoned fish in a taco.  The pork carnitas were very dry, tough and chewy.  A lot of of our food was left on the plate.  This restaurant is off our list."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! Ask for Angel and try his cake, it's a winner! Angel is a great server and his personality and service brings us back time after time!"}
{"text":"Hacienda's is a treat and I am happy to give it 4 stars.  Angel the bar tender is awesome, the happy hour is great and the staff is friendly.  Our last few visits have really been a pleasure and I am a big fan of the Mexican Caesar salad they offer.  A nice family feeling restaurant in a great North Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"I ordered the flat steak and found it to be tasteless.  The frozen margarita, my bad, order the drink on the rocks. The service was great."}
{"text":"We just had a wedding rehearsal dinner here on Saturday, May 28, 2016.  The staff did an excellent job of meeting all of our expectations and more.  The food was delicious and there was plenty of it.  The owners,  Juan and Irene  were a pleasure to work with and we ended up with the party that we wanted.  If you are planning any kind of party, this is the place to have it.  They will do a great job."}
{"text":"Ok we have been here four times now. Frankly I just keep forgetting to yelp places, for good or ill. It's just too much of a pain in the ass anymore. However, we were next-door getting massage and decided to come here for some happy hour drinking on a Saturday afternoon. 

Four out of four times we have been here the place is just awesome and five stars every time. 

Angel (I think that's his name) has been our bartender every time. I have never seen a bartender work so goddamn hard in my life and keep things going as well as he does. His tequila recommendations are awesome, his service is fast, and the rest of the staff is amazing. Top that off with killer deals on happy hour appetizers and drinks, and this place is solid gold for northern County area. 

And Hey... The food is also pretty solid. We had a bitchin' calamari and some guacamole to die for. The fajitas will also melt your smell and taste buds off. 

Get here. That's a fact, Jack."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers, I found the service to be good which is the reason for two stars.  The food, however, was not good.  The burrito tasted like campbell's chicken soup or probably a lot of corn starch and chicken bouillion mixed with water - really.  I know food and I love food and did not expect high end based on the prices but did expect good taste - did not get it.  The menu needs a lot of work.  People who go to mexican food restaurants REALLY DO want mexican food but it seems this restaurant thinks it needs to cater to an american neighborhood grill with bland taste and NO authentic taste whatsoever."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Mexican restaurant - authentic and delicious food, with very friendly and attentive service.......never disappoints."}
{"text":"I have been a faithful customer of Hacienda's for over a year now.  I went there last week and i thought what was shady was they kept asking if we wanted more chips and salsa and we said yes.  When we received our bill we were charged for it.  I think it is very tacky of a nice restaurant like this to charge for chips and salsa.  The amount of money they make on food and drinks there is disgusting that they are starting to do this.  What I do not understand if you go to the restaurant solo you get chips, but if you go with 4 others you only get one basket of chips as well.  It is not about the money because honestly I can afford it.  It is about an owner getting greedy.  They lost our whole family at this restaurant.  We will go back to Jalapeno Inferno."}
{"text":"Nice fresh tortilla chips.   Combination of corn and seasoned flour.   I had the chicken tostados and my husband had the hard shell tacos.    Love the refried black beans and flavorful rice. Delicious food and very nice server.  Large and tasty margaritas."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying haciendas! I had heard wonderful things about it. Unfortunately when my daughters tacos were served the majority of the meet was gristle and fat. After pointing it out to the waiter he explained to me that is just how the meat is braised and sometimes that happens! She didn't eat any of it.  We were not offered a new taco nor did he take it off of our bill! 
Very disappointed since Mexican food is my fav!"}
{"text":"Service very friendly. Food mediocre to poor. The chicken chimi had roasted mushy chicken mixed with a mushroom cream sauce in a weird deep fried batter and rotten tasting guacamole on top. We left our dinner on the plate."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. Service was curtious however slow to greet us and get drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent local Mexican Restaurant. Friendly service and fast. Huge margaritas.  Ample servings, home made corn tortillas, home made salsa, the real deal. Reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I've been in North North Scottsdale now 3 years and never ventured in to The Hacienda Grill.  We finally went in and tried it on a whim one day and it is the most authentic middle of Mexico food I've had since I visited Mexico city and points east.   The Carnitas, in the Carnitas Chili Relleno, are seasoned and cooked like I've only had from the mother of a friend who grew up deep in Mexico.  The Yucateca Chochinita Pibil is out of this world, cooked for 10 hours with a terrific mix of seasonings.  The Ole Mole Enchiladas have the flavor of home made traditional Mole as well.  Rarely have I felt compelled to try everything on a menu but I am definitely going to at the Hacienda. What a find!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night.  Believe it or not it's tough to find good Mexican Food in that area.  El Encanto in Cave Creek is the closest high quality choice.

Pros
- Nice build out.  Cool furniture and nice decor.
- Authentic Cuisine, you can tell the owners are true to their Mexican roots.
- Homemade tortilla chips and salsa.  Chips were really good although a little salty.
- Gigantic Margaritas.  See my photo posted on Yelp.
- Chicken Mole was great.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.

Cons
- Empanadas had a great salsa on top but the stuffed ground beef was not very tasty at all.
- Carnitas Fajitas were completely lacking in flavor.  Not sure what went wrong with this dish?

So as you can see overall a solid restaurant and we will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"Good food the service was terrible ! Will not go back because of the service! 
Waited 20 min for salsa refill then they lost our order. Just about to walk out when they realized we were ignored. If I were you I would not go there if hungry! Even then I had to walk out to get my bill ! Pathetic !"}
{"text":"OMG The old mole enchiladas are dangerously delicious. You will crave them on a weekly basis after having them once. I love this place and we are never disappointed. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive as well."}
{"text":"We dine at Mexican restaurants a lot.  This one truly is one of the best.  Fresh ingredients and creative dishes are the standard.  And the staff is also first rate."}
{"text":"The good: 

--Strong and cheap happy hour margaritas;
--Huge portions of nachos with enough carne asada to make a hungry carnivore very happy;
-- Good salsa;
-- Very nice and attentive staff. No questions asked when I had to send something back. The waiter was very understanding.

The bad: 
-- Mashed black beans on the nachos. Tastes like some kind of paste. 

The ugly: 
-- \"Ole Mole\" cheese enchilada:  the cheese was cold and the flavor was inedible. Again, mashed black beans. Can't we have a choice, like good old fashioned pinto beans? 

I'd come back for margaritas and chips for sure."}
{"text":"Juan was a great waiter. Very friendly and personal. Margaritas, we ordered skinny, were great. Chips and salsa were also very good. That was it though. They were out of Avocados so could not do table side guacamole. They have \"green chili\" on the menu but it is a green verde sauce not green chili. Street tacos were decent but not great. Enchiladas were OK but red sauce was not good. Much better Mexican restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere,  great service and the food is better than any Mexican restaurant I have been to. Huge Margharitas. The best kept secret in the north Scottsdale/Carefree area.  Family owned. Awesome"}
{"text":"Great new Mexican in n Scottsdale very good menu and good tasty food, nice bar area. Really good staff especially JR, hard working crew all very friendly and well trained. Give it a try and ask for spicy hot if thats what you like. Visible managers watching what's going on, busy even quite late. Good luck to them!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Conveniently located. Super nice and friendly staff :-) For we ordered the iceberg wedge salad with Chipotle bleu cheese dressing with grilled shrimp on the side. We were so delighted. The food was fresh and delicious.  The serving size was generous."}
{"text":"Had the tacos on the appetizer menu and they were just delicious, chips and salsa are nothing to rave about but my aunt did Oder the gluten free enchiladas and they were served with beans and rice , the black beans fist off were so good!!! And the rice was absolutely ridiculously good definitely not your average Mexican rice wish I had Ordered a side of each for myself!"}
{"text":"Top dog in the Mexican food category in Carefree/Cave Creek.

Their specialty dishes are 5 star...all the key Mexican sides...guac chips salsa Margaritas first rate. It's packed for a reason."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is just normal for a place that just opened but pretty much everything was bad for us. Too bright lighting, dirty seats, hard to read menus, bad salsa, weird chips, terrible margaritas, slow to no service (had to ask for someone to come to the table) $18 for fajitas that contained 6 small shrimp? 3 tiny tortillas with that? Yikes, won't be back..."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We came in because of the 1¢ margaritas, I mean,  who would't?
But then we sat at the bar and met the vivacious bartender Angel. He was hilarious and made the heck out of a spicy cilantro margarita. Not too spicy, not to sweet. And HUGE.
The 1¢ marg wasn't bad, just smaller.
We had the fajitas (shrimp / chicken) and were very pleasantly surprised when they arrived with a reasonable amount of onions and peppers, not ALL peppers and onions. The corn tortillas were pretty legit.
All told dinner was better than Ok but I've had better Mexican.
Until Angel came out with the tres leches cake which was arguably the very best tres leches I have ever had. 
The only reason why I am giving this place 4 and not 5 was because the manager was really jerky to the staff. We could hear him yelling and had a very dour expression on his face all night. That can't be good for morale..."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The service is good and staff is very friendly!  Fajitas were delicious, my husband said. I ordered the relleno beef fundido. It was so delicious and spiced just right. Salsa is good and since we like a little spice, the waiter brought us some of that. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience with staff and the food.  The burrito and chime was not in a flour tortilla, but dough.  I ordered albondigas soup and got chicken vegetable and was told sorry.  This was the absolutely worst food I have ever tasted, it was not Mexican food or ethenic Mexican food - I lived in Mexico and this was a cheap cut version.  We ordered the seafood lobster enchilda and there was ground imitation seafood, but not fresh.
Plus, when we complained they said sorry and walked away.  I am not use to complaining, but be aware of the weird attitude of the staff and the poor food."}
{"text":"I am very pleased with Hacienda's, especially for a restaurant that just opened about a month ago. The interior is very new and clean and the bar in the middle is very nice. They also have another bar at the front that can serve the patio which wraps around the front. The chips are good, especially the little green ones and their salsa is very tasty. They even made an extra hot sauce for me.

The bar staff is excellent and very knowledgeable. They have a great happy hour with $2.50 drafts and $5 appetizers (love the street tacos).  M-Sat 3-6. The margarita tasted fresh and like a marg should.

Dining there is nice and we have had good service each time. Authentic mexican music plays in the background and makes the experience feel right. The sizzling fajitas are very tasty. I will continue to have good times here.  Not sure what some of the low reviewers are talking about. I suggest giving the place another chance now that they have had some time to settle in."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is friendly, their food was very good. The only reason why I would not give them a five star is because we had to ask the servers to refill our water at times and ask them for the spicy salsa that comes with the chips they serve."}
{"text":"We make it here about once a month and have always been satisfied. I've had the tacos which are very good but my favorite dish is the Cochinita Pibil (a marinated pork dish). My wife always goes for the chicken fajitas which she says is also very good.

The service here is also very good. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable; for example, I had no idea what Cochinita Pibil was but my server not only explained it but recommended it.

This is a well appointed, classy Mexican restaurant with a large bar area.  At first glance the prices look a little high but you aren't eating at a restaurant ending with \"-berto\"."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa and food were excellent. The service was mediocre. The food was not brought at the same time for our table and the server was inattentive. Also we were there for happy hour but were charged the regular price for a Margarita that was tasteless. We'll go back for the food but hope for a different dining experience."}
{"text":"Restaurant and setting is beautiful. Margaritas are huge and tasty. They have great beers on tap including popular Mexican beers. Lastly, the food is terrific and the service is great. Highly recommend this northern Scottsdale gem."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that my second experience here was much better than my first.  

This time around, service was wonderful.  The chips are clearly house made and delicious (they even sneak some fried flour tortilla chips in your basket - bonus).  The margaritas are cranium-sized and quite tasty.  My fish tacos were somewhat untraditional but yummy nonetheless.  

The restaurant has a beautiful view of the mountains.  It adds a lot of great ambiance. 

This space has been home to a number of places...  I hope this one makes it."}
{"text":"The customer service was great but the food was just ok. If you need Mexican and can't find anywhere else to go then this is a good spot."}
{"text":"What can I say...I LOVE this place! Authentic superb Mexican food!  Sangria is made fresh daily and is HUGE!  And The carnitas michoacan platter....you will think you have died and gone to heaven:). Also they are dog friendly we bring our yorkie here all the time and sit on the patio and the staff is very friendly to our dog.  It's our favorite place!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"No need to hurry back. Pleasant atmosphere.  Upon being seated, was given chips and salsa. The chips were multi-colored, not fresh, and some were soft, likely made from flour.  I order chicken fajitas....a large and tasty portion which was served with 2 tortillas. 2 tortillas, really ?
The size of the dish required 2 additional orders (2 in each order).  When the check arrived, I was charged an additional $3.00 for the extra orders of tortillas.  I have been to dozens of Mexican restaurants and never charged for extra tortillas, particularly when you only get 2 with your order.  In my opinion, charging for extra \"required\" tortillas to adequately finish your entree is a stupid policy and has lost Hacienda's Mexican Grill the writer of this review."}
{"text":"We went at a slow time.  Customers were an afterthought to the staff.  The food was just OK.  We had fajitas .  Plenty of food, but it was just OK.  We may try again."}
{"text":"Hacienda's is a nice restaurant, hidden and tucked into a strip mall.  We came for HH and had great service and enjoyed the food. We had:

- Queso Fundido: It arrived and I initially cringed because it looked like that bright orange, processed nacho cheese stuff which I really don't like...but something they did to it made it taste so good! There was fresh spinach and tomatoes added in, and some kind of spice added in. The classic potato chips it was served with were perfect with the dip.
- Sopes: Yum! Filling and tasty. The actual sope by itself was a little dry but with all the flavorful toppings it was overall very good.
- Margaritas: Now we got non-HH margaritas and though it was GIANT (I mean like the size of my head), there was barely any tequila in it. It tasted like sweet/sour mix and no one wants to drink that much mixer...My draft beer on the other hand was very good. 

Most of the people in the restaurant were an older age, which attests to the good prices :) I can attest to yummy food."}
{"text":"This is somewhat better. Service more timely. There are still some issues.  Food about the same. I think management recognizes there is a problem and is trying to deal with it. Will see what happens next.  Better than the alternative."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! Our waiter Rudy was so nice and attentive , definitely will go back. Don't pass on the table side guacamole , and ask for hot salsa , has a great flavor to go with a heát that will make you down your oversized margarita quickly.  Fajitas were good and big enough to share."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was great, this time not as much. Still great service, hot sauce and beers but some dirty dishes on the table and the tacos were served less than hot :-(
Hoping it was just one bad day. Will give it another chance."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant while out running errands. We were in the mood for Mexican food and this tucked away place fit the  bill. The salsa was mild. We asked for something spicy and they delivered. Yum. I had the Airline chicken con mole. The mole was homemade and delicious. A simple and authentic dish, which was a grilled chicken breast on a bed of mole sauce with black beans and rice. The black beans were creamy and delicious. My husband had the fish tacos. This dish was not as good. Small chunks of good fish but the dish lacked condiments to add to the tacos. The service was friendly and prompt. They have a nice selection of tequila. Don Julio 1942 for $20 is a deal compares to other places I've been. We'd come back for sure and try some of the margaritas on the menu at happy hour."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Excellent service and food was top notch. First off, they brought us two different kinds of salsa and both corn and flour tortilla chips. Great selection of drinks and a really extensive lunch menu.

I had the grilled avocado salad which was delicious. Lettuce and shrimp were fresh and portion was huge. My fiancé liked his wet burrito as well.

Parking is easy and there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.

On the menu, you'll find everything from traditional tacos, quesadillas, flautas and burritos to shrimp empanadas, salmon, and a nice variety of salads. Plenty of gluten-free and vegetarian options as well.

Slightly more expensive than other Mexican restaurants but worth it. Check in on yelp for 10% off."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but this place just isn't very good. I have been here several times, am a local, and the only thing that I've had that's decent is the happy hour food and margaritas. 

Tonight I tried again, I had the pollo Fundito. There was very little flavor in any of it. The jalapeño cream sauce on top was OK. But the rice and beans that came with it bad. 

The service here isn't great either, we had to keep tracking down our server to get drinks, napkins, etc. 

I'm not sure what happened to this place, it just a seems like it went downhill. It started off great but it seems like the love has died out."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our 6th visit to Hacienda in the last year.  When we moved to Scottsdale we were thrilled that we had found such a charming, accommodating restaurant ,but I have to be honest....though the food is good (not fabulous) the last two times we were there the service was awful.  it's safe to say that last evenings (4/29/2018) was the worst service we have ever experienced. We got there at about 540pm.  It was very quiet, but it was a Sunday evening.  We were seated fairly promptly and we received water.  The good experience ended there.  Our waitress, Denisse, came by and asked if we wanted a cocktail.  in fairness we were undecided, but did say we would let her know.  She asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we hadn't had a chance to look at the menu so she said she'd come back.  It seemed like it was 20-30 minutes before she came back and we hadn't seen her on the floor.  When she got back I asked if she had forgotten us and she said she just wanted to give us plenty of time.  She had not asked if we had decided on a beverage nor offered to refill our empty water glasses. She disappeared from the floor again and my husband finally stopped another server and asked for water refills.  When the food came out Denisse ran each entrée out separately with 5 or more minutes between each entrée.  At this point we decided that she must be enjoying visiting with someone in the kitchen as we could hear laughing from that area.  She never asked how everything was nor did she ask to refill our glasses.  She was basically absent from the floor.  It was frustrating.....there were only 3 of us, an exhausted husband, a 90 yr old mother and myself.  we had really been looking forward to dinner there and it was a disappointing experience.  We finally had to ask for boxes, ask for a check, ask her to take it.....all in all we sat there for almost 1 hr 50 minutes  all for 3 taco, and 2 ala cart burritos (that we were charged full price for)."}
{"text":"The ambience akin to sports bar doesn't quite go together with this place being a Mexican restaurant. The food however, is exceptionally authentic and marvelously delicious.  Starting out with chips and salsa, but here's the unique twist. The chips are comprised of conventional corn chips, but also green chips that are made from flour. The green chips do taste as though they were made in-house, fresh out of the chef's domain.

The drinks are large enough for 2 if not 3. They are mixed superbly with just the right amount of alcohol balanced with fruit juice.

I had their street tacos and the taste reminded me of this restaurant in Texas with all the unique flavours of street tacos should. Another person in our party ordered their empanada dish and that too was excellent. 

The portions were not too large but enough to satisfy the pallet in more ways than one. Throughout the dish, I could not see any grease that is considered as the norm in Mexican dish. The dishes were well presented and well placed.

As I stated earlier, had the restaurant resembled less of a sports bar and more of Mexican casa, I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"No Bueno!
The meal was just ok- not good. Chicken flautas with guacamole and refried black beans with weird sticky rice- meh!
My husband had a 'not very good' Chicken Chimichanga and said we could make it better at home! His giant Margarita was super watered down and flavorless and had no salt on the rim.
Salsa was bland and wouldn't stay on the crumbling chips! 
The numerous flies seemed to be enjoying our dinner more than we were! The waiter and waitress were openly discussing why she didn't get any tables tonight. At least we got a 10% off Yelp discount on our dinner- needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,

I am in search of delicious Mexican food that is full of flavor and a little heat. I came to Haciendas hoping to find this (and it is close to us) but was left with want, once again. The street tacos were dry, burrito was filled to the brim with chicken but it had no flavor, and the salsa was tasteless as well. Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad - it just is ok. The service was great and the staff was friendly which is enough for me to give it a second chance - in time. For now I will sit and dream about the glorious Mexican food we left behind in New Mexico

Yours truly,
Desperately seeking good food"}
{"text":"We Love this place, it's one of our favorites!!! The food is amazing and the service is just as great! The best chips and salsa this side of New Mexico!!! If you go you must ask for Angel, he makes the whole experience... If he is not there, you are in great hands with Juan!!"}
{"text":"We have been searching high and low for a good Mexican restaurant and we finally found Haciendas and it blows everywhere else out of the water!! Exceptional customer service and amazing homemade authentic Mexican food! I highly recommend the Tacos El Pastor along with the tableside guacamole and Posole soup! It is our new favorite restaurant! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Received a coupon in the mail-plex mailing and decided to give it a try. Figured we had better go soon since new places seem to close quickly these days! 
Loved the decor, very inviting and nice yet comfortable. 
The salsa was delicious! Very fresh and cold, almost like a gazpacho which is the way salsa should be to me, except with more heat. Chips were ok, generic, but I ate quite a few since the salsa was so good.
The menu is refreshing, more traditional and not like the same old same old of hundreds of other restaurants. I had the Irene enchiladas, hubby had chimichangas which were very light and while still crispy and fried seem a bit softer than usual. It was a nice change from something fried to within an inch of it's life! The enchiladas were terrific also!
The black beans and white rice were also a nice change.
Please stay open...we are coming back soon!"}
{"text":"If you want super greasy food and sub par salsa with not a lot of taste this place is for you. Skinny margs weren't great. Mini chicken tacos and quesadillas were dripping in grease. Pass."}
{"text":"Walked in the other night and as we were being seated we saw a dog inside the restaurant. I complained about the dog to the guy who seated us and he said it was a service dog. The dog was clearly not a service dog for the young couple it was with. It was one of those long wiener dogs. It was looking up and the couple trying to get some food. It even started yipping a little cause the couple was not giving it food. If i was not looking at the couple I really think the dog would have been given food. Then the waiter drops some chips and salsa at the table for us and goes to the dog and starts petting it. He then started working without washing his hands. We then decided it was time to go. Went to another Mexican restaurant up the road and enjoyed a dinner with no dog crying and begging for food. Also your staff petting, handling the dog  and not washing his hands is a health code violation."}
{"text":"I took my Mom here for a painting event and was excited to try a new place not too far from our new house.  The service was mediocre.  The margarita was tasty and I saw that they serve a massive sized one as well, but only had the normal.  We ordered the cheese and spinach dip, but the spinach was not cut up at all and made it difficult to get the dip on a chip without it dripping or falling off. It was happy hour when we got there, but the menu didn't say what  that included and the bartender didn't let us know either, so I just didn't bother ordering anything else.  Doubt I would go back.  It wasn't terrible, but there are much better executed Mexican restaurants I would travel to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks!!  Chicken is all white meat & ground beef is not greasy at all.  Good portions.  Angel makes super tasty Golden Cadillac Margaritas.... definitely will return again!!  Very Very nice people that work there... zero complaints... all positive feedback:)"}
{"text":"Great Lunch!  Haven't been in for a while, so thought I would try it again.  Took my mom and my m-in-law, food enjoyed by all!  Much improved, excellent food!  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely showing its age. Worn out booth cushions and outdated/mismatched patio furniture. Came here for a loved ones birthday dinner (his choice) and tried to get a somewhat healthy meal. Ordered the Baja fish tacos which the waitress assured me were grilled. They were covered in oil and even a pool of it at the bottom of the taco tray. Again, trying to reduce calories I asked for grilled vegetables on the side instead of rice and beans. This is a standard request and I have had many Mexican food restaurants accommodate with some awesome grilled veggies. What came out from this restaurant was what appeared to be the vegetables from the fajitas, again soaked in oil. I understand that I may be one of very few trying to eat healthy at a Mexican food restaurant but even the other food that came out was sub quality."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrific. We had shrimp enchilada not too spicy just right the carnitas is excellent. Kid friendly. Will be back"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost a year and it is fantastic. The staff remembers you & the food quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Great tacos!  I wasn't expecting it to be so nice.  I also thought that the fajitas were really tasty!  Something about that sizzle.  The manager was super knowledgable too, and suggested a mango margarita for my wife which she thought had the perfect balance of taste and tequila. Pro ballers that live in the area have also been known to drop by on occasion too, so good people watching at night.  If you haven't tried it yet, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Hacienda's. The staff and service are amazing. I especially love Angel - the best bartender ever! His sense of humor and level of service make each visit memorable and very enjoyable. Thanks Angel! 

I order Irene's Enchiladas every time I visit. This dish is very delicious and is definitely my favorite. Try it! You won't be disappointed. 

Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Really, really mediocre food accompanied by poor and slow service and stale chips awaits your arrival. Great location and atmosphere with indoor and outdoor dining. It's really too bad. The Pollo Fundido wasn't edible and my kids refused to eat chicken nuggets....CHICKEN NUGGETS?!?!"}
{"text":"Last night was the fourth time for us to go to Haciendas. This time we felt good enough to bring some good friends in from Seattle. We took advantage of their Happy Hour and sat on the patio. Good beer prices,  the only down side was they didn't have oranges for our Blue Moons.......by the second round they came through with them. Nice touch! We tried almost every app on the menus and loved them all and you can't beat the HH prices @ $4 each. The nachos were a hit with all of us and the chicken street tacos were the favorite. Love this place because the HH is great and you cant beat the prices.......and its so close we could walk if we wanted. Happy to see this new place open and hope it stays for years to come. Oh and the service was good as well. Would have given 5 stars but on the first few visits we had a hard time getting quick service on the patio. 

One of our new favorite places in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We had just flown in and were STARVING. Our cute waitress kept the food coming until we were too full for dessert. 

Loved their spinach flour chips with custom guacamole. Everything was flavorful and delicious--calamari, coconut shrimp, mole' cheese enchiladas, shrimp fajitas, baked avocados with cherry tomatoes and shrimp, tacos stuffed with yummy ground beef, etc."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite restaurant. The staff is friendly and personable; they'll remember you every time you come in. The food and drinks are amazing. They offer a great happy hour and deals that make a dollar go a long way!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for REAL Mexican food in North far North Scottsdale, you have to try Hacienda's Mexican Grill.  What incredible food!  It's in the Summit Plaza (the Target store is here) on North Scottsdale Rd, just before you reach Cave Creek.  Dine here....you won't regret it!!!  Oh, and the Margaritas are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and sat outside on a nice sunny day. Overall, I liked this place.  We had above average margaritas that were both huge and a good deal. I had chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The three enchiladas had a lot of chicken and a decent sauce that was flavorful but lacking heat. I liked the fresh tasting beans and the rice that sort of reminded me of fried rice.  I loved it. My wife had the dish tacos which were excellent. They had a lot of tasty fish with good slaw and sauce to make your own. I rate this as above average suburban Mexican. Not amazingly authentic but fresh and tasty. I would go back, and their happy hour looks great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a not very busy Saturday at 1pm. When I saw that they had mole I was pleased. My server brought out my chips & salsa and beverage. A short while later he took my order for mole enchiladas. The food arrived, the mole was the best part of the meal; enchiladas were bland, rice was dry and refried beans lacked flavor. Server never returned to inquire of my satisfaction or if I needed more water. Upon asking for my bill I was offered more aqua. I guess for a strip mall the level of food preparation and customer service was to be expected. I had hoped for more. Will another establishment when back in the area."}
{"text":"Great Mexican cuisine, nice ambiance and excellent service.  Our favorite local Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously awful ,   I had a burrito which was plain and tasteless, chips were junk and salsa was a joke. Really too bad this place will fail like others in this spot. What Mexican joint serves ravioli? I guess hacienda is trying to redefine but with no success. Go to rubios and you'll get better taste."}
{"text":"UPDATE-we went two weeks ago and they served my husband \"seafood tacos\". They looked and smelled like cat food. My Chimi was big enough to share, but halfway through our meal my stomach started hurting so badly we left. Will not be back-it was pretty bad. It went from a favorite to a \"won't be back\" in the blink of an eye, I think I had food poisoning."}
{"text":"As always, Angel the bartender us a true gem in North Scottsdale. (He is just as salty as the rim of my Marg)"}
{"text":"I had to update this review.  We went last night for our third visit - the first two were great!

The food this time around was disappointing to say the least.  Some of it was bland...and the stuff that wasn't, tasted like something it shouldn't, i.e. - the rice that came on the side with the fajitas tasted like FISH.  WHAT the hell is that about?  The guac tasted like it could have come from a box, it had no flavor at all and was thin except for the chunks of onion and tomato, and the chips just tasted weird.  Our daughter kept commenting on it as well.  If I kid doesn't like something as simple as corn chips, there's something wrong.  Everything was just bland.  The drink was decent...but it stopped there.

Total bummer.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is bland and flavorless we tried dinner 2 times once during the week and again on a weekend. Same issues both times service is simply slow and lazy the food is not good and equally lazy. My burrito was half grilled chicken and the other half black beans...somehow both halves were equally dry. Just another bad North Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and dining experience. Salsa and chips were great. Salsa fresh and not too spicy and the chips were also fresh. Had the chimi and a combo of appetizers for dinner. (nachos, sopes and tostadas) All was excellent!! The flan for desert I brought home and it was just good a few hours later. Maybe better fresh. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, always delicious and hot and quickly served, truly the nicest staff in the Valley with a handsome, relaxing ambiance...what's not to like?  Except I always fill up on the delicious house-made chips and the salsa they make with roasted tomatoes followed by a delicious entree...a different dish every visit...can't decide on a fave....never have room for dessert!"}
{"text":"A penny margarita..thank you very much yelp!! Came here with my family for the first time tonight. I'd say it deserves three and a half stars, wishing it was an option. Was pretty empty for a Saturday night which was nice because it was quiet. 
I enjoyed the purple lights in the restaurant haha, thought it added to the atmosphere. Just liked how it looked in general! Got chips and salsa and they were ok. Would've liked a more flavorful salsa. The spinach type chips were interesting. Also kinda stinks that you have to pay for more chips because most places you do not have to. Our server was great, he deserves 5 stars, got everything right and did everything in a timely matter, etc. 
I got my penny margarita thanks to yelp! Tasted a bit watered down, but for a penny I'd say it was worth it for sure. I decided on veggie fajitas without sour cream and with corn tortillas. They came sizzling! One thing I liked was the variety of vegetables, there were a lot of different kinds of veggies which made me happy. Also came with a good helping of guac. The beans were meh. Vegetables were good but a little bit over cooked for my liking. But overall a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"If I had to sum up the experience this evening it would go something like this: good food, atrocious experience. Here is why:
1) 15 minutes after being seated, the chips and salsa was nowhere to be seen. People seated after us had already received theirs. So what are we? Chopped liver? Our money not as good as others'?
2) Told 2 different people but to no avail. Actually the appetizers we ordered arrived before the chips and salsa.
3) Actually the appetizers arrived before the beverages.
4) Finally, the drinks arrive and they arrive in installments.
5) BTW, the appetizers are on the table but no silverware, no plates.
6) Then the plates arrive: 4 for 7 guests. Must be communal eating. If I wanted to eat Ethiopian style I would have gone to an Ethiopian restaurant.
7) Credit must be given where due. The food was good. However, the drinks were no more than mediocre for the price. A $20 Presidential Margarita was little more than a watered down concoction of margarita mix and sugar.
8) The insult to injury was a $4 charge for a shared item. What bull?
9) The server spent a fair amount of time selling us on his other vocation: fine art. Wanted us to go to his website and buy his fine art.
10) Last but not the least when the server brought out the check, he had the gall to say that he expedited our drinks. Are you kidding me???

These are my top 10 reasons that I will not be coming back. Long story short, this restaurant is not making it into my Rolodex."}
{"text":"Went to Hacienda's after hearing great things from friends/neighbors.

I was very happy with the suggestion to try out Hacienda's.  The food was excellent with service to match.  The restaurant is immaculate inside, the food was well prepared & seasoned perfectly, prices were very reasonable, wait staff was friendly and very professional, there wasn't a time where I had to ask someone for a refill of water/soda/chips/salsa - they were spot on, kids loved their meals & ate everything, bathrooms were spotless, you can even catch you're favorite team while enjoying a great meal!  What more can you ask for?

I'd definitely go back and recommend Hacienda's to anyone looking for great food, great service in a relaxing atmosphere.

Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Kathy and I live just across the street from the Hacienda. We have seen a number of restaurants come and go in this location. But the Hacienda Grill has been there for awhile now so we tried it last week. We were very pleasantly surprised at the quality and flavors of the food. We love the table side Guacamole! 
We are looking forward to going there tonight. I am going to try the avocado salad and of course, the Guac...."}
{"text":"Hacienda Grill is the bomb!! My husband and I are regulars. We have hosted special occasion dinners along with stopping in for our favorite meals. I love the chile relleno snd the rice is deliciosa. My husband always orders the carnitas and they are superb. Thank you for being so wonderful every time we stop in to eat."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican restaurant located in The Summit with a few other restaurants and establishments.  Food is good and enjoyable.  Happy Hour or a regular menu are available.  Not a true Mexican restaurant but nevertheless tasty.  Wait staff keeps tabs on their customers so you won't have to flag them down."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and margaritas!!! I would come here anytime!! I highly recommend the street tacos!! Great cilantro and ask for fresh jalapenos!!!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in North Scottsdale. Very authentic and tasty food. Plus the menu has all the tradioanl stuff pluss a good healthy mix of new and interesting dishes. Ask to have Angel wait on you! He likes to deviate off of the menu and will make some good recomendations. He's pretty funny too!"}
{"text":"All we had were the street tacos .... carnitas, carne asada & shrimp and guacamole.  The guacamole was fresh with chucks of avocado. The tacos tasted good and were a good value.  We were in time to get lunch prices which was a big plus.  We will be back to try some of there other dishes, but for now it's nice to have something close by where we can get a decent taco at a  fair price.  Nice decor and nice patio area for dining al fresco."}
{"text":"Delicious. Salsa. Chips. Hot salsa is hot!! The table side guac. The barbacoa is best ever. Cold beer $4. Deep fried ice cream with raspberry sauce. All so good!!  Family run. Friendly and great customer service. Just go."}
{"text":"We go here most every Friday.  The food is always consistent, the margaritas are large & the service great!   Ask to sit in Rudy's section."}
{"text":"Good quality Mexican food in a strip mall setting in north Scottsdale.

Ever in search of true authentic Mexican food on our annual visits to Scottsdale, we decided to head north and try this spot after seeing them on a list of top 10 authentic Mexican restaurants.

The large space situated in the corner of a large shopping area with a Safeway and a Target was clean and inviting inside although not very busy when we stopped for lunch on a rainy Sunday in February.

Our server was friendly and attentive and helped guide our choices.  My wife selected the avocado salad (3 grilled avocado halves, greens and some grilled shrimp) which was good. I opted for the chicken enchiladas which were stuffed with lots of juicy roasted chicken but were a bit on the bland side as was the accompanying rice. Unfortunately nothing too special.

Bottom line:  Good quality at a reasonable price but alas, my search continues...."}
{"text":"We drove in from Anthem since there isn't any good Mexican places there.  Food was very good and they have great happy hour deals.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good authentic Mexican food along with  excellent service Hacienda will not disappoint! Our server Kay was the sweetest kindest young lady,  she made it a pleasure to truly enjoy our meal. Mango margaritas were delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and have been in search of some good Mexican food...and we found it today!!!!  Everything was delicious...from the homemade chips and salsa (mild and hot), to the guacamole, the huge margaritas, the fajita meats, EVERYTHING!  They have both indoor and patio dining too!  One of the very best parts was our server, Angel!  He was attentive, had great suggestions, very funny, and even reminded us to come back for happy hour!!!  We will absolutely be dining here a lot!!!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food..Angel at the bar was great.  The margaritas were completely off the chain!  The ambiance is fantastic-not flashy but very nice.  The bar area is very well laid out and the staff seems to genuinely enjoy their jobs.  For a Scottsdale joint the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"After a long wait we tried another trip back to Hacienda.  This time the experience was much different than the several times before.  We only ordered a few items of food, but everything was much improved from when we went over a year before. Service was excellent, Margaritas perfect, not too sweet like you find in so many bars, the appetizers were very good except the three chicken tacos that were exceptionally greasy and not really tacos but more like a pastry puff, terrible.  However, the guacamole is one of the best I have ever had, not creamy and frozen pre made goop, but nicely constructed and fresh. The aioli sauce was also excellent as well as the spinach queso dip.  The salsa that comes with the chips is good, not over salted, but mild.  Ask for their hotter sauce, it will satisfy anyone who likes hot chile, I mixed the two together to create the perfect mix. Along with the corn chips, thin and crispy, they bring a spinach flour tortilla chip which is a nice touch for those who like something different.  The tostadas had a nice Mexican white cheese on them, and black beans.  The food has some flair, and not really standard Sonoran style, but the crafting of the food is good.  A bit pricey for what you get, but this should be a good food trip for guests and out of town travelers looking for something memorable."}
{"text":"Ok. I had a less than positive predisposition walking in, based on last two restaurants in this space. Not fair, I know.  But...it beat my expectations. the margs were huge (albeit oddly warm when first served...the ice chilled it soon enough). Limited on tap beers, but we found something that works. The chips were stale, salsa was good. The lobster enchiladas (3 of them, the special) were good, as was the lobster quesadilla (with side of guacamole). Portions were large and tasty. The blackbeans served on the side could use a bit more seasoning, but they're not the showcase of the meal anyway. Good neighborhood joint...& this 'hood needs another one! We'll try again!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! Ashley is a fantastic bartender! Loved the Yelp deal for the .01 margarita! Boyfriend has been wanting to take me here and I'm so happy we finally came! Will be back.... :-)"}
{"text":"Very good inexpensive Mexican food!!! Fantastic happy hour!!!! The staff is very personable with excellent service especially Angel."}
{"text":"I am a second generation AZ native so I think I may be part Mexican just by default of being born here.  ;)  

I LOVE mexican food but like any true Arizonian, I can tell the BS places from the truly authentic, delicious joints (i.e. El Encanto (or El Encrapo as I call it) has a wonderful atmosphere but terrible food.

Hacienda's is Mexican food with so much originality, flavor, and freshness that it is BY FAR my favorite Mexican food place.  It has a tough job to beat Spotted Donkey right down the street but a very family friendly atmosphere with great service.

YUM!

Their street tacos are REALLY tiny though, just FYI but otherwise their portions are pretty substantial."}
{"text":"Poor service, restaurant was only half full on a Saturday night and we had to wait to be served."}
{"text":"I don't like to write reviews for places where I've only been once because I know my mood affects the way I feel about things. I also like to give second chances to establishments that, for some reason or another, were not up to par the first time, specially if it's a place like Hacienda's, that is close to my office and where I can grab a good bite at a reasonable price. 

I think that lady who wrote that angry review earlier was clearly having a bad day altogether because I've been to this restaurant a few times, and none of these times --  although some were better than others -- I had such a bad experience. I also don't get why I someone was upset that the owner was visiting other local businesses. I'd say that's part of an owner's job. The general manager overlooks the staff IMO . And by the way, I've had Guacamole in more than one dish there, I'm sure that if she had asked, she would've gotten a side of guac in one of those little molcajete dishes. 

I've had a few of their appetizers, the sopes, the empanadas, the street tacos the tostadas and the Nachos. Don't order the nachos unless you have two or more really hungry people. The sopes and tostadas are very similar but  the sopes have a thicker deep fried tortilla.The street tacos are small, but that's how a true \"street taco\" from El DF is. My favorite one is the Empanada, because it tastes like it's made with homemade Picadillo.

Of the main dishes, I've had the chicken Mole. It's unfair for me to rate it because for someone with a Mexican mom who can cook authentic mole, no other mole will ever come close. But I can say they're on the right track. I've heard from the staff that they are listening closely to feedback they're getting from the locals and are adjusting to the taste of  this new location. And I can tell it's true because I've had a few different types of salsa with their chips and the flavor has gotten better and better.  

Will I return? Yes, I gotta go back to try their deep-fried Ice cream."}
{"text":"Every time we eat here the food and atmosphere are pleasing. Try the spicy salsa. It is mouth-on-fire hot and soo good!"}
{"text":"I didn't know that this restaurant existed until I saw a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), and I'm sure glad I gave it a try.  I would have never thought that one of the better mexican spots in the valley would be this far north?  No wait and live music at 7:00 on a Friday night also made for an enjoyable night.

The restaurant itself doesn't scream mexican in anyway.  There is a stage and couches to the right of the bar.  The band that was playing on this particular night played a modern jazz style of music, giving Hacienda's more of an upscale lounge ambiance.

We were seated immediately, and chips and salsa were placed on the table in seconds.  Already a good start!  I ordered Irene's Anaheim Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas.  Very good.  The plate is covered in a mushroom sauce that a lot of people may like better than I did.  I personally would have preferred a traditional red or green enchilada sauce, but I'll give Hacienda's credit for doing something unique.  My wife had the chicken fajitas.  Who doesn't love good fajitas?  Not only was this a good meal, but it could easily feed at least two.  If you order it, you're going to need to take it home, maybe with an extra tortilla or two.

We were seated by the kitchen and watched countless fried ice creams being brought to the tables.  Wow, did they look good.  Somehow, we decided to skip out on desert, but we certainly will have to give it a try next time."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go-to places.  My wife and I both had a lamb dish last night which was excellent.  We will often go there for happy hour, split an order of nachos, which is plenty for the two of us.  Friendly staff, fast and courteous service and good prices."}
{"text":"Hacienda's is the place if you want authentic  Mexican food from different regions of Mexico.  There are dishes here you just can't get anywhere else.  If you are lucky enough to go when they have the Lamb Barbacoa (the best dish I have ever had at any Mexican restaurant)  order it and thank me later.  The Cochinita Pibal, Pork marinated in fruit juice and cooked in banana leaves is a savory treat and served with their house made tortillas.  Yum!  The Tomatilla Pork Ribs are also fantastic.  They also have the usual Mexican dishes such as Cheese Enchilada's in a savory red or green sauce or Fish Taco's ect,  all very good. I ask them to make me Shrimp Tacos and they are wonderful.  Try the Cheese Crisp (not on the dinner menu but they are happy to make it for you) as your appetizer!  They have great salsa too!  If you are looking for bland American style Mexican food this is not your place.  Once in a blue moon they miss the mark, but what real good  restaurant doesn't?"}
{"text":"So very disappointed... My family came here once a week, now we will never be back.  Our non-profit organization booked our meetings here for the entire year.  We were told tonight, (on a meeting night with a guest speaker coming), that we were \"no longer welcome\" because we had not been spending enough money there.  In the meantime, the place was empty.  I thought Hacienda's was our community partner - I was obviously very wrong.  If you care about our community, you will not eat at Hacienda's again....."}
{"text":"Not too bad... had the chicken burrito. Waiter was very attentive and polite, service was quick, and the place was clean.  If I were to personally rate the burrito, I thought the chicken was a bit dry.  My girlfriend got a margarita and really enjoyed it.  Overall, not my favorite but good."}
{"text":"Was staying at The Boulders and stopped here for dinner. There was no wait and they had live music which was a nice touch. After perusing the menu, I decided on the Carne a la Tampiquena. My bf had the chicken enchiladas. The chips and salsa they brought out was pretty good. We both enjoyed our entrees - I had a feeling they forgot the tortillas with my entree, which they did, but i didn't have a menu to check so I didn't bother asking in case they charged extra for them. For dessert we shared an order of sopapilla, which, be forewarned their version is a mini version (like little pizza rolls). They were still good, just not as expected. 

Only reason I'm not giving them a 4 is because they seem to have a major fly problem. I'm guessing they had their doors/windows open earlier in the day, but flies were buzzing around nonstop and I heard another table or two bring it up to their servers."}
{"text":"It was okay, not in any hurry to go back. Very different menu than other Mexican food restaurants in this area. Waitress was okay, did not clear table of used dishes in a prompt way, and not very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a quiet hideaway that deserves a shout out. Great drinks, excellent food and superior service. A good go-to when you want good Mexican food in an area with mediocre Mexican food at best. Angel is an excellent server. Enjoy a house marg inside or out."}
{"text":"Visited on recommendation of a neighbor.  We were not disappointed!  The service was great, and the food came out quickly and was seasoned to perfection.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  The timing between them was perfect.  We never needed to request a refill and our waiter was on top of every request without hovering.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends.  Great neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch yesterday while running some errands. The chips were nice and light, and they mix in some flour tortilla chips that are a greenish color which I assume means there's some guacamole flavor or something. I didn't get a ton of that but they were still good. The salsa was really good. Bright, nice texture, balanced flavors.

I ordered the green chicken chimichanga, because, duh, chimichanga. The chicken was all white meat, juicy, finely shredded, delicious. The portion sizes were good too. I have but two qualms and it's really kind of just nit-picky stuff. 

First, they try too hard on the plating. It's Mexican food. There's no need to be prissy about it. In their defense, they're close enough to Troon that prissy plating is probably required by some city ordinance. But seriously - forming your rice in a pyramid and trying to keep it all separate? Please. Either you make a pretty plate OR you put shredded iceberg lettuce as a garnish, but not both. 

Second, it appears that there's a white woman from the Midwest working in the kitchen. As I said, the chimichanga was delicious and the green chile sauce was lovely, however, it seemed to have a cream of mushroom soup base and they put actual large chunks of mushroom in the sauce. Mushrooms, In green chile sauce. On a chimichanga. Just let that soak in a minute. Then in their little cilantro lime rice pyramid, they put peas and carrots. That's right. Actual peas and carrots. In cilantro lime rice. At a Mexican restaurant. Weird.

As I said, the qualms are nit-picky. The food was overall quite good and the service was attentive without being annoying. Definitely going back. I'll just ask them to hold the peas and carrots."}
{"text":"The service was horrible!  Only 5 tables occupied.  Brought the wrong wine then offered a $20 a glass wine to replace the $8 glass and charge $20!  The food was very low quality.  Took forever to get check.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner tonight with my hunny and was impressed. The food was fresh, flavorful, and the portions were perfect! The margaritas were awesome! I tried the house, the one with prickly pear, and the coconut ginger margarita and they were perfectly concocted. The restaurant is pretty big and really nicely decorated. I experienced excellent service, our server Joel was great and the manager checked in on us too. Overall, it was an excellent dinner and I would love to come again!"}
{"text":"Hacienda's has been in business for several years and the food has remained consistent. The service on the other hand has seriously declined.  Had dinner here with the parents and our server named Fabio left quite a lot to be desired.  I don't think I have ever singled out a server on here before but this guy was out there, like on another planet!  Every request we made with him was met with an open stare followed by confusion. I don't think he had a poor attitude there was just something really off with him and he was extremely slow.  Literally one of the top 5 worst servers I have ever encountered, every interaction was completely awkward and it wasn't just me, my parents were equally put off.  The three star rating is recovered for the food, I had the steak fajitas and they were pretty good.  My parents had shrimp enchiladas and tacos both of them were also satisfied with the meal.  Unfortunate to let service ruin the hard work in the kitchen, hopefully management will take note."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! The food was amazing--best rice I've had at a Mexican restaurant. The staff works as a team, at least 4 people checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. As someone who works in the hospitality indistry, I was extremely impressed with the level of service & quality of the food. Our server Angel was very warm & funny, & the manager Costa made us feel welcome. I wish we lived closer to this place, we'd eat here every week!"}
{"text":"Huge margarita's at $9 each. You could taste the tequila, and that's a plus. 

Multi colored chips and moderately spicy salsa were brought promptly. 

I had the steak fajitas. Steak was good and there was plenty to fill three flour tortillas. Tons of green and red peppers though. No tomatoes. None. Sides included guacamole, sour cream, refried black beans and white rice. White rice?  Really? And no cheese. 

My wife had the tampaquena...skirt steak and a chicken enchilada. Steak was cut up, not a full uncut piece of skirt steak (weird). Enchilada was passable but nothing great. 

Fried ice cream for dessert. Huge and delicious. 

This is a typical Scottsdale/Phoenix restaurant. High expectations but disappointing. I swear they just don't know how to cook anything here. We're from Chicago and have high quality restaurants. This area is sorely lacking anything with quality and taste."}
{"text":"Great Margarita Lemon Basil YUMMMM....Totally recommend... chips and salsa great... but I have to rave about the.....  Carnitas Chilie Relleno .... Completely amazing sweet and spicy great combination....  Even though not very busy during the afternoon hours we came at 2:30 but still have to recommend great food and drinks...  Daytime bartender Angel he is amazing fun and gives  Great food recommendations.... Angel can make a killer Margarita any style you want"}
{"text":"We've tried this place out twice now. Great ambiance and location. Food is ok. The burrito is served naked. looks weird and uninviting to eat, but taste ok. They do serve large portions, but would be nice to have lunch size options and pricing. How much should you pay for Mexican food? Less than what they charge is for sure! They follow a long line of unsuccessful restaurants in that location and will might be jinxed! I would not recommend this place. Many other choices in the area! Save your money!"}
{"text":"We brought visitors, 3 adults and a 3 year old. Rather than having tîme-sensitivity and waiting on us quickly to avoid a child meltdown, our waiter was took nearly 10 minutes before acknowledging us. Then another 10 minutes before any drinks arrived, and we still had not ordered dinner. The kitchen runners came with the meals, but one meal was missing. They disappeared and said they would be right back with the other meal, so we waited, and waited. It became obvious that the meal was not waiting in the kitchen, it had not been ordered! We searched for our waiter, or a manager, but no one in authority could be found. The payoff was when the waiter brought the check. I instantly gave him my credit card, expecting him to return promptly so we could get out, but, again, he was gone for a very long time. Pathetic! Never will I go there again."}
{"text":"With stellar margaritas and a great setting, Hacienda's might break the curse for this location."}
{"text":"The Mexican food here is great albeit not what you would typically expect as I feel like the dishes are more modern takes on traditional dishes. I always get the chicken fajitas and have never been disappointed. Kenny always takes great care of us and I would be sure to request him when dining here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. 
Great chips and salsa. 
Server was very enthusiastic about the menu and recommended two specialties (one was pork pibil and the other was something he nicknamed Mexican lasagna). 
The pibil was very good and the other dish was outstanding. Sides were not quite as described on menu but we both still loved our meals and plan to return soon to try more."}
{"text":"Very good If you have a hankering for Mexican this will satisfy. The table side guacamole was the best! Fresh and satisfying. The margeritas are huge!!
Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Ok, I usually reserve any 5-star rating for something that is the best of the best of where I go to eat/hangout/etc. 

However, my experience here was really above and beyond. 

The atmosphere is cool... Nothing crazy you might not see somewhere else... It is very comfortable and cozy. We came around 5pm on a Saturday and there were PLENTY of seats and no wait. 

Our waiter was outstanding. They offer a Guac dip and they make it at your table! Never have seen that! They carve out the avacados and other ingredients and make it... I'm not a Guac fan but I did try a little and it was immensely more fresh than other Guac I've ever had. 

I had the taco trio - carne asada and chicken - they seemed to be big on the pork there, but I'm not a pork guy, but other people at my table loved it. The portion on the meat was GREAT!!! How many times I've had a taco and was like \"WHERE IS THE MEAT!?\" - well, it's over at hacienda haha ... I was going to get the Baja fish tacos but made with Tilapia... Which, I don't eat lol 

We also got a lot of questions answered about Mexican food/origin of different dishes and combos, etc. really well done!!!!"}
{"text":"We finally found our new favorite eatery!  This was a great place & if you check in you get this fantastic margarita for 1cent!  
The atmosphere is very nice, upscale & plenty of room. Lot's of outdoor seating. 
We were lucky to have Angel as our server. He was great!  Funny & informative & super knowledgable about the menu. 
The food is fantastic. Great flavors. Hubby had chili relleno. Fantastic. I had mushroom & spinach enchilada. Another fantastic. Tres leche for desert & super fantastic!  Our new favorite place. We used to be fans of Jalepeno Inferno, but this puts them to shame. Go to Hacienda. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"First visit. Very good Margaritas, tasty chips, quesadilla and chimichanga. Service was good. Reasonable prices.  Nice clean restaurant where you can have a conversation.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. In fact, the food is definitely 4-5 star territory. Here's the issue, it seems like no one working here realizes they are running a restaurant. Very poor service, no attention to detail, no place settings, no responsiveness. In a day when restaurants are lucky to have customers and stay open...management here needs to WAKE UP!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I got the green chile chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend got the steak burrito. We also got chips and guacamole. The guacamole is made to order and delicious! The enchiladas were yummy and the perfect portion. We had the strawberry house margaritas to drink. They were huge! Great service! Our server was Joel and he was very nice! I would come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love their food here. Specially fish tacos. Huge drinks. I've been here for lunch and happy hour. Food is always good and service is always excellent. We'll be back. Oh love the green chips as well."}
{"text":"Very popular restaurant by the younger set. Good, fast, friendly service by very attractive staff. Definitely what you would expect from a good restaurant. Large portions, especially with the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. We had chicken fajitas that were just okay, would never order them again. That's if I were to ever go back, which I'm not. The chicken had a processed rubbery texture. The black beans, guac, and rice didn't have enough flavor and not fresh. The best part was the chips and salsa, except for the fact that they charge you if you want more, and they only bring you a 1/4 size cup of salsa and a small basket of chips. They also give you three tortillas with your $16 fajitas and if you want more, guess what, they charge you for that too. The business seems to be struggling (and I can see why) therefore they charge for things that in a healthy business environment would be complimentary.  This was our second time eating here and we won't go back again."}
{"text":"I love the street tacos, I think they are a pretty good deal too.  You can mix and match and get a chicken, pork and beef one if you want.  The chips and salsa are also really good here.  Service was good and prices are fair."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is kind of an upscale Mexican compared to what I'm used to but the prices are affordable.  

I had the chicken enchiladas and my girlfriend had the fish taco's both of which were delicious and good portions.

If you have a drink you have to try the margarita.  It's a decent drink (I'm not a huge fan of them anyway) but it's huge.  Probably the size of 2 or 3 regular drinks.  And a fair price at $9."}
{"text":"This was very good Mexican food. I bought the yelp deal and I was so glad I did. The service was fast and friendly. We ordered chicken nachos for an appetizer and they were excellent. Also, the chips and salsa here are amazing. I had the chicken enchiladas for dinner and they were very good. They came with rice and beans which were also yummy. My husband had the pork thing, and the pork was so well seasoned. Everything was delicious and we eat quite a bit of Mexican food. This place was great! Also, the prices are so reasonable. And what really made our evening was the server. He was great, and he was so funny. He had us laughing multiple times. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location has turned over several times over the years, which is perplexing given the enviable location.   Only a couple buildings down, Pei Wei rocks it with a steady flow of business.  

Hacienda is another disappointment, adding to the lineage of subpar establishments that have attempted to gain a foothold here in the Summit.  

Service is slow and could really use an extra body or two both with the waitstaff and bussers. The Calamari salad's centerpiece, the calamari itself, was bready and underseasoned.  The Chile Relleno could have been good, but there was too much cheese stuffed inside the peppers.  This, coupled with the fact that the Chiles needed another minute in the fryer, contributed to a mealy almost pasty interior which I just couldn't stomach.  

The drinks need some attention, too. The Mango Miracle is anything but a godsend. Overladen with cilantro and finished with a mango nectar which has no mango flavor, I was left still searching for that miracle.  The skinny organic margarita was oddly bubbly with an overly sweet aftertaste.  

Unhappily, I think we will find that the Hacienda will soon become the ex - Hacienda in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"If you like real authentic Mexican food, Haciendas is the place to go! They have only been open for a couple of weeks but we have been serveral times now. One of my favorite dishes is the Mole Enchiladas and they also have a great salad with homemade blueberry vinegrette. Great Happy Hour menu as well!! Love Flight Night on Thursdays! We will be back:)"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  Excellent service. If you get Angel for your server, you're in for a treat. He's a riot"}
{"text":"Always have a wonderful time here, all the staff are wonderful! Angel and Edward are great and make sure everything is perfect and genuinely care if you are happy. The shrimp tacos are my favorite and I love their tart margaritas, because they're made with limes of course :)"}
{"text":"The waitress was great. The avocado guacamole was delicious. First batch of chips were hard, but refill was crisp and perfect.

Friend didn't care for her margarita. She said too sweet, but plenty of alcohol.

The tacos were plentiful.

The rice wasn't the standard Spanish rice, but it was surprisingly delicious, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.

Enchiladas, with chicken, delicious."}
{"text":"I am editing my review. Horrible Cinco de Mayo experience. We wanted a couple margaritas and nachos, but they had a special limited one sheet of paper menu. That would be fine if they advised customers ahead of time or post it on the door to give patrons a choice of spending their money. No, they get your drink order, no happy hour either, then give you a limited, high priced menu. When we said we wouldn't have ordered drinks if we knew of the limited menu, they could care less. I have a food allergy and need to watch my food. They offered no help. The owner was even less concerned. He said it was \"his special day\" ... so customers don't count I guess. He offered nothing  but shrugged shoulders. This restaurant is close to us but the service is horrendous. The owners even worse. Don't eat here. We saw others leaving as well because of the high priced limited menu. Seems the owners are out for $$$ more than pleasing customers. The restaurant wasn't even filled. We will never eat here again. Beware. The customer does not come first here. 


We finally got over to Hacienda. I love this place for all the Gluten Free options it has. For me, it is difficult eating out but they have a great variety of GF appetizers, salads, and entrees. They made sure my chips were corn chips which was nice. The margaritas were very good and huge! I ordered the Yucateca. It was very good, spicy, and filling. My husband had the Pollo Fundido and said it was too full of chicken but good. We had fried ice cream for desert and it was very good too. All around ... it was a good dining experience. Hacienda is only a couple miles from my house so we will be going again."}
{"text":"Meal began with housemade stone ground corn chips mixed in with multi-color flour tortilla chips, nicely paired with a fresh mild salsa.  A hotter salsa was available so we tried it, but it seemed to be a \"medium\" at best but nonetheless very flavorable.

Portobello mushroom & carmelized onion quesadilla was rather good, as were the vegetable fajitas.  Draft pour of Modelo Especial rounded out the meal nicely.

Our service right at the opening hour was impeccable with plenty of attention, including a kind visit from the manager to insure that everything was just right.   Place has a modern feel that is just a few notches short of being pretentious so it strikes a nice balance somewhere between casual & formal.

Our only negative was the queso fundido which was served in a room temp plate.  The cheese had already congealed into an oval disk that moved as one entity when I tried to make a scoop at it with my corn chip.  Fundido should be served hot enough that it is still gooey, and ideally in some sort of heat preserving skillet or similar.  They really need to change that appetizer."}
