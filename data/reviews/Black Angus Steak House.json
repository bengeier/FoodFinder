{"text":"I've been going to the Black Angus Steak House for over 20 years. In that span I've tried every high-end Toronto steak house and none have produced a piece of meat as good as the Angus. Period. 

Here's how you do the Angus: Take down two extra dry gin or vodka martiinis. At least a couple baskets of their garlic cheese bread. Eat a few pickles. Next, step lively through a shrimp cocktail. Then order your steak. Filet, Bone-In Rib, New York. They're all awesome. Go for hte 16 oz New York. Blue rare. Mammoth your way through that, finish it up with a couple fingers of your favourite single malt, and weave home. That's all there is to it."}
{"text":"Excellent. But, don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself. Go ahead and be critical while you're at it because you will find something wrong . It just won't be the quality of the food and most likely won't be the service. You can pick on the decor though since it's a relatively easy target. The building is quite unattractive: white painted stucco and no windows. It may as well be a Wal-Mart. Also, the interior is updated and the bull horn light fixtures bit gaudy-ish so be prepared for that.

Hype often leaves me feeling that something is over-rated and I tend to find reasons to support that view. Black Angus, however, pretty much lives up to it's name. The food is extremely high quality, the service is impeccable, and if you like wine, you will have more choices than you could ever sample in a lifetime including some extremely rare vintages.

The menu is as thick as an encyclopedia and contains useful information , suggestions for cooking preferences, and the reasons why their beautiful, well-fed beef is superior to anything you've ever experienced before. The more you know about something, the easier it is to make an informed choice and while the menu is biased, there is definitely a lot of valuable information in it. Take some time to read through it.

We dined with someone who hates french onion soup but he actually finished an entire bowl of it and commented that it was excellent. It was definitely delicious as were the mini crisp-breads accompanying the soup.

Wild salmon and they will tell you exactly which cold waters it originated from whether it's Alaska, Scotland, Norway, etc.

Considering what comes with each entree, the meals are fairly reasonably priced. The sides aren't stingy. You get a decently sized portion of veggies or whatever side you order. The quality of beef and fish is outstanding and the flavors are delicious. Expect to pay close to $40 for a salmon entree which comes with vegetables. The steaks are priced according to weight and there is quite a range. 

This is a destination restaurant where it is worth celebrating life events like birthdays and anniversaries. If you go, you absolutely must make a reservation. We went on a Tuesday night which we thought wouldn't require a reservation but there was an hour wait at 6:30 pm. We stayed in the bar area until a table was ready and the wait ended up being much less than an hour.

Overall, an excellent dining experience with delicious high-quality food and superior service."}
{"text":"Easily the best steakhouse in Toronto.
Etobicoke's secret gem of steakhouse perfection.
Going on 40+ years
Choice beef cooked to perfection and one of the only steak houses in Toronto that can cook from medium well to Boston blue and nail it to surgical precision.
Big gnarly wooden plates, classic garlic bread and dill pickles appetizers.
Go now."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite steak houses.  The interior of the email restaurant looks like a classic English steakhouse.  

The steak cuts and quality are excellent! The meat is cured to perfection and is cooked on a grill that can be seen from your table.  

The serving staff are awesome."}
{"text":"I used come here all the time as it was by far the best steak I've had arguably anywhere ever. Unfortunately after the Reno they seemed to have changed meat suppliers. Almost positive of this as beyond just the quality; they removed the bone in filet for a silly \"bacon wrapped\" filet. Only amateur steakhouses do this to artificially add flavour. Disappointing as this used to be a real great place."}
{"text":"I went to the Black Angus for a birthday celebration. It is out of the downtown core, all the way in Etobicoke... but I had heard that it was a great steakhouse. Not really the kind of spot where you see many young people....I mean, I did go there for an 80th birthday party. 

From the outside, it looks like a house straight out of Germany!!...Really bavarian but that gave it character..... The inside was really dark...As I was getting prepared to experience their \"never frozen steaks\", the waiter who had been working there for 30 years approached me for my order. (30 years? Wow!) I could also see the steaks hanging from where I was sitting, so that was cool.

I suggest that you MUST try the following:
-Ceasar Salad (really fresh, made from scratch)
-9 oz Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon (delicious)
-Garlic bread (authentic). 

All the sides are extra. It is not cheap, but must of their customers return bi-weekly, if not every week, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Toronto. They seemed to have fixed previous kinks and is back to the same standard it was prior to the change in owner. Worth a try if you're a steak lover!"}
{"text":"What an unsuspecting delish steakhouse. I think I've driven by this place so many times and never noticed it. It's sort of tucked away but the exterior is no indication of the beautiful interior. 

My steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and the wine menu was fantastic. 

Would recommend this spot if you're outside of the downtown core over and over again."}
{"text":"After reading rave reviews on Black Angus I decided to give this place a try. For reference, I've been to Jacob's, Barberian's, Ruth Chris (both Toronto and Mississauga). I'd say that Black Angus Steakhouse sits just slightly below Ruth Chris in terms of service and steak quality. If you're willing to spend $100 per person for a meal then you'd be advised that there are better places. 

Ambiance 2/5 : Despite being newly renovated, the restaurant does not feel upscale in anyway. One word to describe the decor is bland and nothing speaks of character / uniqueness of this place. The overall feel of the place is comparable to The Keg which is not a compliment.  

Service 3/5 : Service was cold, perhaps because we don't frequent this place regularly. We had noticed that the table beside us got a better service, but regrettably up to a point where our appetizer was missed and given to the table next to us. When asked about our appetizer, the server was apologetic and corrected the mistake and expedited our order. When the server was asked for a refill of water, he asked \"tap ?\" which is highly unusual as he had asked that question when we first ordered the water. 

Steak 3/5 : We had ordered Rib Steak and T-Bone for medium rare and medium respectively. Strangely, both steaks was cooked inconsistently. Some part of the Rib Steak is medium rare but significant other was cooked medium (overall it's closer to medium). The T-Bone steak also suffered this inconsistent cooking between medium to medium well. The steak was enjoyable and has enough flavor - however when you pay this much for a steak you would expect nothing but perfection. 

Overall 3/5: When this restaurant is compared to Jacob's or Barberian's - it would not win on any aspect of food / service and ambiance. For the price level that they compete - I simply can't justify returning to this establishment. If you say that this steakhouse is the best in town - I'll agree to this statement considering there aren't many competing steakhouses in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Celebrated our sons 15th last night and as expected service was great and all of our steaks done to expectation. Although the Caesar salad which arrived full of the leaf stems was changed for one with proper leafs was a disappointment the overall dinner was very nice. 

The presentation of a great cheese cake with some birthday song was a nice touch. 

It had been many years since we had come here but hopefully will not be long till our return."}
{"text":"Arrived and was seated right away, but then waited 10 mins for water and a greeting from the waiter, and the place was only half full.  When I ordered my steak, I asked for it to be charred on the outside and was told that the steaks were done on a char broiler and all the steaks were charred, however, when my steak arrived, it was not charred.  Mediocre service for a place charging a premium price.  I don't mind paying up, but it has to be worth it.  There are many other great steak houses in the city, and I would recommend many of them, but the Keg has better steaks, better service and greater value than this place. Nothing to see here..."}
{"text":"The Steak was the star of the show!   As it should be.   The rest of the food was good, not great but good.   I had a Steak(Awesome), Escargot (don't bother), Oysters(not bad) and New York cheese cake was extraordinary).   Overall i would go back but it's a little pricy but i would go on occasion - owner was friendly and so was the staff.  Garlic bread was excellent, nice and crispy but you need to really really like garlic - it's not for the shy that's for sure. - I gave it a 4 star - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Steaks were cooked to perfection. Service was excellent. Lost much of its ambience under new owner, but still good food,"}
{"text":"This is the best steak in Toronto!  Some of the best I've had anywhere. I keep going back and taking people, all of whom love it too.  The steak chef has cooked over a million by my math and he does it on a coal grill where all can see.  It doesn't look like anything magic is happening, but the flavor on the steaks is unbelievable. Just try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here for the best steak in town. The service and the owner are so friendly.  It's our number one choice all the time.  They just finished their new renovations can't wait to see it and enjoy another excellent meal !!!!!."}
{"text":"I went here a few months back and liked it but did not love it.  Quite liked the menu but was surprised to see a small selection of cuts. 

The steak I had was ok but over cooked, which was also surprising. I like med rare and this was a full on medium. 

I was expecting a lot lore from the Caesar salad. Most high end steak houses have killer Caesar salads, but this one was just like any you would get at a earls or a moxies. 

Wait staff were good and like the ambience. 

Overall I would expect more from an expensive steakhouse."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for steak, Black Angus always comes to mind. It's hands down one of the best steakhouse restaurants in the city. Have never had a bad experience. I love the new stylish décor. And the steaks? Delicious!"}
