{"text":"If you want to experience Sushi, come to Kumai. Not only are you guided through your meal by the lovely host there. The sushi is as good as it gets. If you want to experience a thoroughly japanese experience get the Bento box. 

The benitoro (salmon rolls) are to die for!! Chef Kumai even roasts the seaweed a little. The unagi sushi is the best I have ever had. Even their salad and miso soup is amazing. 

I cant go to any other sushi place anymore. A treasure in mississauga thats for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Kumai regularly for the past 3 years.  It's consistently good food, the staff are very friendly and there's always something new to try.

I think the best description of Kumai is Japanese comfort food.  The sushi is excellent, but the real treats are their cooked dishes: bento, Japanese curry, noodles, chawanmushi, and so on.  I'm also a huge fan of their maguro yamakake.

My only complaint is their menus aren't accurate.  I recommend asking the server for recommendations.  Ask for which sushi she recommends, or what seasonal dishes they are offering.  They often have interesting items not listed on the menu.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Over the years, I have been enjoying the food there. The decoration may be outdated and it may take a bit time for Kumai-san to prepare for larger party, but the quality has never been compromised. However, even great thing comes to an end... Mayumi @ Kumai Sushi has just called me and telling me they are closed. However, Kumai-san will move to a new establishment in J-town, Mifune. It will be opened some time in July, 2012 and the new number will be 905-305-1333.

{"text":"I first went to Kumai many years ago when I first started eating sushi. I didn't enjoy it much then since my knowledge of what \"good sushi\" meant was non-existent.  The only thing I ate back then were California rolls and spicy salmon rolls.

I took my husband to Kumai last Friday night.  We loved all of the dishes we ordered. We had chicken karage, salmon sushi belly rmaki and one of the trays with sushi and sashimi.

It was all fresh and delicious. The cuts of the fish were larger than other restaurants.  The sushi rice was perfectly done and the right size for the pieces of fish.

The server was kind enough to point out which were the best items on the menu (the tray) and some special sushi they had that day. 

The soy sauce they had was homemade. I actually overheard a regular talking to the sushi chef about how she loves using their homemade soy sauce at home (guess she got a freebie?).

I don't like the pickled ginger typically served at Japanese restaurants. Kumai's pickled ginger was yet again homemade and was so good.

That same weekend, I had another hankering for sushi. Rather than going back to Kumai, I went to Sehmi Sushi on Winston Churchill (never again!!! Gross!).  That was a mistake I'll never make again. I'd rather make the 15 minute drive across the city to Kumai than eat crap sushi elsewhere.,"}
{"text":"Great omakase sushi. Authentic traditional Japanese cuisine. Japanese chef who knows how to pick the right fish. He always gets it from his favorite fish shop. Go here for the sushi!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad Kumai has closed! I've been coming here with my family/dad since as long as I can remember. It's basically my dad's go to whenever we are looking for quality sushi (he clearly goes often without us cause the server knows our family name right away).

One of the few true Japanese-owned businesses in the GTA area, so I'm very sad to see it has closed doors. I do assume it is because the chef retired since I know him and his wife have been doing it for quite some time now. 

My dad pretty much always ordered the Sakura set. Beautifully presented, always fresh and high-quality fish and the rice was just right. I've yet to find anywhere that does it like this in the GTA. I've also tried the udon which is very good (the dashi is made fresh in-house).

For those who got to try Kumai, you will understand why you can't compare this to a shoddy AYCE.

UPDATE: I just learnt they have a new place in J-town area called Mifune ! Thanks http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/873737 - I've already planned to let my dad know haha."}
{"text":"Kumai Sushi is really the only Japanese restaurant in Mississauga worth visiting with the departure of Hashimoto.  However, the experience is also bitter sweet.  I will explain later on.  It is predominantly a sushi bar but does offer some unique Japanese treats if you leave the traditional menu alone.  As I always say, order Omakase if you want to know what the sushi chef can really do.

The restaurant is small but this is a good sign when looking for raw fish.  The owner mans the sushi bar while his wife serves.  This is also a good sign.  The interior is classic but also strangely rough.  There are details throughout the restaurant that have been left unattended that are uncharacteristic of the Japanese way.  Attention to detail is a major reason I fell in love with Japanese food and here I feel in a way let down.  Details from the picture above show where the lacquer on the sushi tray requires touch-up, or linens and stock lining the hallways and table cloths of select cleanliness.  I go to, and will still return to Kumai as the chef is known for making everything from scratch and carries unique items like monkfish liver when in season.

This is their Omakase sushi, with fresh water eel, Otoro (Bluefin Tuna Belly), Squid, Tamago (egg omelete), Ikura (Salmon egg), Aji (Spanish Mackerel), Generic Salmon and shrimp. 

In summary I want more for Kumai as the food can be great but in my guess there are other things going on.  Do you have any comments on Kumai?  I would love to hear them."}
{"text":"Overall a nice restaurant for authentic Japanese in Mississauga.

When the restaurant becomes busy, the service can slow considerably. It seems that there's only one server at all times. She is very pleasant and polite though. 

Food quality is excellent, as you have an authentic Japanese chef/owner at the helm. A lot of items on the menu usually aren't in stock however."}
{"text":"I have mixed reactions to this restaurant. We've gone back a few times and it's been inconsistent from a food and service point of view. The restaurant has really bad environment. It's stale, cold, and really quite plain. It almost feels like a commercial office.

As for the food, I feel the food quality is really good. The have a fish selection that is above the average sushi restaurant. The king salmon, fatty tuna belly, Spanish mackeral... I could go on and on about how each are very delicious. You pay dearly for this though. They're incredibly expensive and you only get slivers. We've walked out of this restaurant hungry multiple times. Yes, we enjoy the sushi when we eat it but when you pay $80 for 2 people and you're still starved, I have issues. The appetizers, such as fish cakes, are well made and more reasonably priced. They do a great chawanmushi. It's silky smooth and the fish broth is so delicious. Plus it's filled with nice chunks of fish cake and seafood.

The service is unusual. There are 2 wait staff. One of them is courteous and really genuinely warm. She's a delight but she's also a bit reserved so it feels slow. The other speaks very little English and perhaps that limits the restaurant to one server handling most non-Japanese speaking clients. She's not rushed and if anything, she feels unattentive. We've had moments where our meals take incredibly long (2 hours) and we honestly feel like it shouldn't. 

Since discovering Toshi in Brampton, I haven't returned back here. It's unfortunate because I think they can be good but their service, price, and food quantity needs work."}
