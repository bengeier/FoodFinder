{"text":"Now this place was ok. I only eat Vegas rolls and they make there's a bit different then all the other places I been to. They were a bit dry to me but still good. Now for the all u can eat deal they have there might not be the best deal u think. They have happy hour from open till they close Monday thru Thursday I think. ALL DAY......... so I did the math and it was cheap to just get the happy hour price then to pay 20 each person. Now on the weekends that deal makes more sense. Now if u don't eat what u order they will charge u what u didn't eat. That is if u left a whole roll.. I personally would not go again."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem is an understatement.   This is a fantastic place to get quality Sushi at very reasonable prices. I lived walking distance from it for a time and I remember the location never being able to stick to a format. Prior to Mido, one restaurant after another fell over time. Mido isn't going away anytime soon from what I see.   The amount of food you can get at this place is fantastic. They start you off with a salad, miso soup and some edemame that is cold and unsalted. Edemame served that way wasn't ideal for me in my first visit, but it sure is a welcomed sight now. You get all this stuff before you even decide what you want to drink. They used to give you a 2nd salad that was an amazing serving of spiced tuna over a bed of lettuce, but those days are long gone.   The sushi has always been a great combination of the traditional along with Pancho's \"special rolls.\" If you are more in to some of the deep fried rolls (like my brother in law is) this place has you covered.  The service has never disappointed and the free Mochi iced cream is a nice touch I see other Sushi places starting to adopt.   The overall experience has always been positive going to Mido. Best place for the money hands down.   Do it."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! I've been looking for a good sushi restaurant in the Chandler area. This one is my favorite so far. The price is good (Happy Hour 50% off sushi/maki essentially all the time except for Friday, Saturday night, and Sunday), you get free miso soup, salad, and edamame -- and the quality is great. Rainbow roll is my favorite. I had a sushi combo a few weeks ago, and it came with mackerel... usually I don't like mackerel because it's got a strong fishy flavor, but this was really fresh and mild and delicious. I would get it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I trust Yelp... so when I see 4 stars, I think \"alright... that's going to be good!\"  Four of us went during their happy hour (which is really the entire day Mon-Thurs) at 7 p.m. and shared 4 rolls.  It came with complimentary soup and salad and a plate of semi-warm edamame.  The soup was pretty much just a broth and the salad was a watery-asian dressed sampler.  The sushi?  It just was not quality.  And the thing is -- I am NOT picky with sushi!  But I sat there eating it and immediately thinking how it distinctly did not taste fresh.  By no means was it awful, but the one fried roll we ordered had a particular taste that made me feel like it had been reheated.  You know when the dough of something freshly fried is crispy and crunchy?  But if you reheat it that item later the crisp is a lot softer?  That's what it felt like.  The service wasn't any better either.  The one great thing that really blew me away was that our total came out to $15.  For FOUR!  That's a little over $5 each for dinner.  So at least the price reflected it.  But honestly, I don't care to pay more for sushi because that is one thing I don't want to risk not being fresh -- raw fish.  When I left I made a silent prayer that my stomach would not be regretting this later.  Fortunately, I am not sick and totally capable of writing this review 12 hours later.  My overall take: Meh."}
{"text":"Have been eating here at least twice a month for the past two years. Sometimes with friends sometimes solo, always good. I think the AYCE value is wonderful ($20). For my friends that don't eat as much as I do the happy hour menu works great. Great quality product, I have found it always consistent. I eat mostly sushi/sashimi and occasionally a roll. I do wish they had a wider variety of fish to sample and uni is usually in short supply. That being said even the higher end joints have sure cut back in this economy.   I like the costumer service, no not the fastest in the world. Pancho makes sure the food gets out, and if it isn't correct he'll fix it.   Drink prices are good if you like sake and beer, which I do. Sake Bomb large beer/small sake ($6).  This is your 5 star (working middle class) sushi bar."}
{"text":"So the food is solid, why the 3 stars you might ask. It's all in the service. Our server had a very negative attitude and rarely came back to check on us. my server took away my tofu bowl when I was still working on it. I'm not sure if I will get a better experience if I go back again, but I'm not sure I'd go back just because of the service and the feeling we were rushed. Overall service is 1-2 stars.  Bottom line is maybe it's just isolated experience but although my food was decent, the service really killed the night."}
{"text":"Love This Place  Incredible Nice Staff and the best Sushi Chefs in Town...."}
{"text":"This is my first review and I just had to share my experience at Mido Sushi. First let me point out we went here on Christmas and we wanted to try a new place. Not many places were open for Sushi and online it said they have happy hour from 5-7.   We get there at 5:30 and right away they come out with miso soup, some ice burg lettuce in a bowl or sesame seed dressing and cold edamame. Little did I know that the complimentary food was the best tasting item! Server came by and I have a LOT of patience for servers because they don't get paid much and live on tips.   We order and she suggests a roll that was 50 cents more than the roll we have ordered at other places. She suggests the crazy roll. We get the crazy roll, two California rolls with masago, salmon sashimi and yellow tail sashimi.   The food comes out. The guy that comes to pick up some napkins and straw wrappers literally rubs his crotch up against my bf's arm and says nothing. The server never came to check on us. We had to flag her down and there wasn't busy. The crazy roll was disgusting, there was a lot of wasabi on the sashimi. I never complain but I told the server I couldn't eat the crazy roll and it was horrible ok so she decided to take it off... Thank god because it was $10.50. Oh and did I mention that it WASN'T happy hour today because it Christmas. That's the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Most people don't even go out to eat on Christmas!   So we are still hungry and I make the big mistake of ordering something else. I must be a slow learner! I should of just left. So we order the \"calamari\". When the \"calamari\" came out of the fryer and the guy from earlier comes out with it and throws it on the table. I about lost my cool but I was now making a joke of this place. I'm looking at this awkward appetizer and my bf and I are looking at it and looking at one another. We say at the same time ...What is that? Did they bring us the wrong order? It looked like 3 fat burnt chicken fingers! And then came with a sauce that tasted like BBQ sauce. What a joke. I have never ever seen calamari in that form! And I'm a sushi junkie I been to a lot of places. I never complain. I watched my bf cut it into pieces like he was slicing up a chicken finger. He attempted to pour salt on it and dip it in soy sauce. He had about 3 bites, brave guy! Later his stomach was hurting.   Total charge $33. I had no change so I paid with a $50. She brings my change a $10 bill, $5 bill and a $1. I'm so ready to leave and now I'm sitting there deciding do I leave a $6 tip or a $10 tip. I think fast and leave the $10 tip. It was Xmas and I believe in good karma. I will never go back there or ever refer someone there not even an enemy or my dog. I have no idea how that place is open. The food is horrible and the service is lacking big time. I'll stick to Sakana or I sushi or anywhere else."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and delicious! Hubby is just getting started with it but so far so good. We've been here twice and can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"I will agree with the others that it is a cheap sushi option.  But I wasn't impressed.  The sashimi was precut, tasteless and soggy (like it was just defrosted).  Also, I saw that they had pre-made rolls on the back counter.  Come on, how hard is it to make a fresh roll?  I would have given them 1 star but we did get free miso and salad and I didn't get sick from the fish.  We got what we paid for."}
{"text":"I like everything at this place EXCEPT for CHICKEN TERIYAKI. Don't expect to see grill marks on your chicken. They said that's because they grill their chicken over a \"foil\".  Chicken was dry."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!  Unless you can really pound sushi, don't order the all-you-can-eat.  Their 50% off will be a better deal.  Complimentary edamame was a nice touch.   The service was great, too."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprise to say the least, their happy hour last until 10pm. When you sit down you get free miso, edamame, and sesame salad. My boyfriend and I ordered three rolls and two iced teas thinking we would be paying at least $30 (what we usually pay at RA) and our bill was only $17.17! The spicy yellowtail roll was my favorite. We say at the sushi bar and were very entertained by the chefs, one who grunted and yelled \"hoy\". We eat sushi at least once every two weeks, and this is probably our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"They have an all you can eat sushi special for $19.95.  The sushi was good, but nothing too special.  It was still an enjoyable experience for $20.  The service is OK.  The waiters weren't very friendly and they can be hard to find at times.  I have also been there for lunch.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.  I had the udon which had a good broth and chewy noodles -- just the way I like it.  It did take over half an hour for me to get my food.  They apologized but did not give an explanation.  (This only happened once)  I think it is worth it to try this place out.  Good food at a reasonable price.  I just hope they improve their speed/service."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Tempe/Chandler area. Enjoy their all you can eat sushi special."}
{"text":"Crappy food. Nosy Korean Woman server. Way too many personal questions.  at one point, She asked what my dad's name was @_@; Random, Weird.  Can customers have some privacy while they eat plz?  Would not go again."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had half stars- this place would be 3.5 but I decided to round up.   When you first arrive, you are seated promptly and served miso soup, a small salad, and edamame. But after that, things sort of go downhill as far as service goes. We have sat a while waiting for a waitress to take our order after we have finished all of our appetizers.  As for the food, I don't have much to complain about except that I have found a hair in my soup once... The sushi is pretty fresh and tasty and a pretty good value but I wouldn't say it's the best in town. Overall, a fairly solid sushi joint if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Best sushi place ever! I actually visiting this place at list once in a week.great for family diner or date.All you can eat its a great offer especially if you are don't eat all day long before.And this green tea is the best tea I ever drink.So I recommend this place for everyone it's 10000% :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for a reasonable price. They had a good amount to choose from for the all you can eat deal, and more outside of that. They also had other traditional menu items. We were pleasantly surprised. Will come back."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful sushi!  Lunch for two under $20.  A true gem if you are in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Awesome deal for the 'all you can eat' with much better variety of nigiri choices compared to other all you can eat sushi joints in the area. Seafood quality has been superb 99% of the time. I was served some uni once that tasted awful. I mentioned it to the server yet I was still charged and no apology was given.   This would be five stars but for the uni experience, and also on occasion, the rice amounts increase (with a corresponding decrease of the seafood portion) when doing all you can eat and ordering A LOT of food."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi but nothing to rave about. Deep fried rolls taste like the fryer oil hasn't been changed in weeks. Think state fair funnel cake batter clung to whatever roll you usually get. All you can eat sushi for $20 is a good concept but the execution is not great.   Horrible service on an entirely new level. Doubt I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mido Sushi for about 3 years + and the food is consistently good and the prices are unbeatable.  In addition to the $19.99 all-you-can-eat sushi (w/some exceptions) they have great lunch specials and happy hours.  I also like the fact that they treat everyone to edamame, miso soup & a house salad.  Although the sushi chefs are pretty friendly and personable...on most of my visits, the waitresses have ranged from brisk to downright exasperated (one even rolled her eyes at me because I asked for tempura sauce and she brought me eel sauce and I had to ask again for tempura sauce).  Overall, based on food and value, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Extremely good service and some of the best sushi I've ever had. My boyfriend and I always go to get the all-you-can-eat sushi and sit at the bar. I enjoy practicing my language skills with the all Korean staff and always leave well fed and happy. I highly recommend Mido to anyone who enjoys great quality fish and sushi rolls! Will come back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I grew up eating sushi and seafood in LA, Im horrified that this has a 4/5 star rating. The rice was at least a day old. All of the fish tasted pretty much the same. There's no waiting area. The service was forgettable.   Do yourself a solid and never go here."}
{"text":"I love this place, and come here for all special occasions!  The quality and selection of sushi is awesome. I've only done all-you-can-eat. The sides and rolls are very good, but I never order them because the nigiri are amazing. The service is great and really fun. The worst thing about Midosushi is deciding between mango, azuki, or green tea ice cream (which comes with the all you can eat!).   Not sure why, but the quality of the sushi is better for dinner than for lunch, even though the price is the same. I can't put my finger on why, but I can perceive the difference."}
{"text":"For the price you cant beat this place anywhere. we go to Midos twice a month and absolutely love it. Will continua to go there.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I wont go any where else for sushi, nothing tastes like it. $20 all you can eat sushi, green tea ice cream, miso soup, salad and edamame. It's about 40 miles from my home and I try to go about once a month, if I lived closer, I'd go more often, it's that good.  The Owner Pancho is always so friendly and nice.  The only reason I gave 4 stars though, is because sometimes when it's busy the waiters/waitress aren't all that friendly and it takes them a while to get to our table, which is understandable, because I know how it is in the food business. But about a year ago they all used to be really nice.  Go there on your birthday, and they'll dim the lights, play cute \"Happy Birthday\" music and let you blow out your candle on wasabi:)"}
{"text":"This is my to go place for sushi. Although they raised their prices for all you can eat, there are no limitations that comes with it! Their deep fried and special rolls are tasty and savoring. The nigiri rolls are good but I could tell that the ahi was previously frozen and not as fresh as I wanted it to me. Believe me, I'm from hawaii and I know what fresh fish looks and tastes like.  Most of the workers are Japanese. They are very welcoming and the chefs at the bar are really funny. However, we did have a server name Brian than was really passive aggressive to our group. Be careful if you have him as a server, he might add a smart/witty remark about your order.   Overall I rate them a 4 because of the environment and authenticity. It's really hard to find a japanese restaurant that has japanese people as owners."}
{"text":"I was looking for AYCE Sushi and I found it at Mido Sushi. The price is right and I got my full of Nigiri sushi and some tasty rolls. Sitting at the bar was a good experience watching the sushi being made. I will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"on the upside, they were open on Christmas, and i was absolutely craving sushi, so yay for finding this place, I highly recommend the deep fried spicy tuna! :)"}
{"text":"This review is for my latest visit to Mido, which was by far the best!  Tonight was my fiance's birthday, and he chose to go to Mido for his sushi fix. Thankfully we managed to go when it wasn't too busy, and we could get a table and not sit at the sushi bar. While the sushi bar is convenient, it's not very private and is cramped.  Anyway, tonight the staff at Mido went above and beyond and I couldn't have chose a better place to experience our night. First of all, knowing every other time we have gone it's been busy and we have to sit at the sushi bar, I called ahead to make sure we could have a table--sure, no problem. Next, however, they did something I thought would have been impossible to explain over the phone-- I requested pre ordered adult beverages be delivered to our table upon arrival, to surprise my fiance for his bday celebration (he's not one to go out of his way to order an adult beverage while we out, so i took the liberty of doing it for him [insert evil laugh here] ) and they did just that...right on queue :)  Ordering and receiving was a breeze as per usual, and everything was fresh and delicious. When it was about time to bring the check, our server attempted to ask if we wanted dessert to celebrate, but fiance was on the phone....next thing we know (he had hung up by this time) disco lights are flashing, Asian techno music sounding similar to happy birthday was playing on a speaker above us, and out came our server with some mango ice cream w/ a candle in it. To top it off, the entire restaurant was clapping and she shot a confetti popper in the air too!   This was by far the best night we've had in such a long time, and we owe it all to Mido! THANKS AGAIN!"}
{"text":"my favorite place for sushi! delicious and cheap. happy hour is nearly all the time except limited hours on the weekend. I would rather drive far to Chandler for mido than go to an overpriced place like RA any day."}
{"text":"Compare to others places I've been to, this is one of the worst, they give you free miso soup and salad but they are bland, both cold and tasteless. The sushi falls behind too. Save your money and go to Teharu down the street"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town, I've been coming here for years and absolutely love it."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! Friendly service, great atmosphere, excellent quality of fish, and a great price of $19.95 which includes miso soup, edamamie, a salad with pieces of crab in it, and your choice of 3 kinds of ice cream.  We eat here about once a week and they know us by name. One way to tell that it is great... mostly all their customers are Korean or Japanese..."}
{"text":"I always end up getting their Mido roll!  Not a big fan of their deep fried stuff.  It always taste like it was left out for awhile or bad oil.  Also like how they serve you miso, salad, and edamame right off the bat."}
{"text":"Half price sushi pretty much all the time!  This place is one of our family's favorites... high quality fish and so many options on the half price menu!  We've never ordered anything other than sushi but it's a sushi lovers dream!"}
{"text":"Decent customer service, good sushi, great prices!  All you can eat sushi is a great deal.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in town! If you come during happy hour (lunch and between 5 and 7) you can get a roll with 8 pieces, edamame, miso, a mini salad, and ice cream for $2.25! On their California Rolls, they put a generous amount of crab."}
{"text":"Visited while on the way back to Las Vegas on a saturday afternoon. There was no wait which was good (in customers perspective) given that it was a weekend afternoon.   Service: Quick and kind Price: $21.99 per person for AYCE on the AYCE list Taste: Some of the fish had a nasty taste as if it were a bit old... such as the scallops. ALSO an important part to note is that... they have a HUGE rice portion on their sushi. Ive had sushi all over the places in California and Las Vegas.. however seen nothing similar to this place. The rice portion is so big.. if you eat like 3 pieces its similar to eating a FULL bowl of rice.. while other places i visited had rice portions a length of my pinky finger, so please be aware and order LITTLE BY LITTLE. Miso was also very bland, it just tasted like water with miso inside."}
{"text":"Mido is the perfect sushi place because it's exactly the right balance of quality and value.  We eat there whenever we want decent sushi - we know we'll get a good product for a good price.  Every meal starts with a salad , miso soup, and edemame.   Why are people complaining about these?  They're free!  And they're good!  Simple, but still very good... and free.  We usually get the All-You-Can-Eat for $20.   I have the tempura appetizer and BF gets the gyoza appetizer.  Both of these typically come out after our first plate of sushi.  That's just how it works at Mido - accept it.  That doesn't mean the service is bad, it just means the sushi came out really quick.  The tempura is wonderful and I really appreciate that they have a large variety of vegetables - bell pepper, carrot, two kinds of sweet potato, mushroom, broccoli, and asparagus (!) - in addition to two shrimp.  The gyoza is pretty standard but the dipping sauce is great and they're always perfectly pan fried.  When it comes to sushi, we mostly stick with nigiri.  The toro, snapper, yellowtail, and shrimp are all really good - fresh and clean tasting.  The salmon is WONDERFUL.  The sushi chef puts a little tiny bit of wasabi on each piece (there's a tip for all the people who mix wasabi into their soy - don't overdo it at Mido).  And the Unagi, which is my favorite, is perfectly done every time.  No pin bones, not over cooked, but not cold either.  Delicious!  As for the rolls - well, I love the rolls at Mido because it's one of the few places where they'll make them without avocado.  I'm allergic and the Mido chefs are always accommodating.  We try different rolls almost every time we go in.  They also have a couple I've never seen anywhere else, like the Gyoza roll.  I've seen a couple complaints about the staff, but we've never had an issue.  Even when they're super busy, they make an effort to serve everyone quickly and politely.  And if you sit at or near the bar, a sushi chef will throw you a hot towel and speak some Spanish to you - very fun!  To sum up - go to Mido if you want to eat a lot of good sushi and not spend a ton of money."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service, nice cold A/C! Definitely recommend and will be back.  The sushi is fresh and delicious. The service was fast, friendly, and accurate."}
{"text":"alright. totally not worth your money. We ordered least 5 different rolls...worst vegas roll EVER! The free soup, salad and edamame were the highlight and best out of anything we got."}
{"text":"A great Sushi delight! Good quality fish and ingredients to a very affordable price. Friendly, fast service. The all you can eat sushi for $ 20.00 is unbeatable! Definitely, a place to visit!"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat sushi for $20 (as long as you finish everything on your plate).    + sashimi + miso soup + tempura + edamame + salad  = best sushi experience ever on a small dime.    My suggestion is to go with some buddies who can eat...in case, you can't finish your portions (like me). :)  P.S. I am VERY picky when it comes to sushi because I get the best in Hawaii where I'm from.  Mido Sushi is pretty comparable to what I get at home."}
{"text":"I picked up my to-go dinner order. When I got home & opened the bag i realized they had given me the wrong order. So it was closing time, nothing I can do as upset as I was. The order they gave me was nearly everything crab, which incidentally I do not eat. The salad in the order had brownish wilted lettuce & the sushi that was not crab I ate but was sub par. Again, the fish & even the ginger looked old and dry. I was really surprised by this. Anyways; I feel if foods such as sushi  are just below average they are not worth trying again."}
{"text":"If you like sushi, all you can eat sushi, then this place is for you!  For $21.99, you can get your fill of a variety of rolls and regular 2pc sushi choices.  I've been here several times and never been disappointed.  The quality is good and fresh.  The only tip I can suggest is coming at an off peak time.  When it gets busy, it takes a while to get your order...but that just lets you know quite a few other people think this place is good, too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been a sushi lover for years, and this place is the TOPS!!!  The owner and staff are one of a kind friendly, and their sushi is as good of quality as you can get!  Their rolls are huge, they have happy hour pricing on almost the entire menu (5 or 6 days a week) and they always offer all you can eat for like $19.50.  I love this place and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix 3 years ago, my husband and I have been on a quest for good sushi. We started with Mido (lucky!) and thought it was great, but tried other places around the valley because it is not close to home. We keep going back to Mido - we like the environment, it's fresh, and you can't beat their all you can eat menu!"}
{"text":"Love there happy hour deals. We go there at least twice a month. Service can improve. I have had better sushi at other places but for the price during happy hour, I can settle with second to best!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $21.99. Great deal! The nigiri was smaller than I'm used to but the menu selection is great. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with how good the sushi was here. I enjoy the lunch specials from time to time and I always make sure to get a rainbow roll when I go. The fish used for the sushi is good quality and has a nice taste. The edamame are good too and taste fresh, not microwaved like at a lot of places. The service is good and they bring you your food in a timely manner. It is a good spot for lunch with friends or for business. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sushi spots considering Mido has an all you can eat option for just over $20. No Sushi conveyor belt here. The rolls are made as you order. A small side salad, miso soup and an appetizer option of sashimi, gyoza, or mixed vegetable tempura. The entire meals ends with a scoop of ice cream (green tea ice cream: my personal fave). Who can say no to that!"}
{"text":"We ordered the all u can eat Sushi, which means we can order whatever we want to eat. However they intentionally slow to make the food. When we ask why it was so slow they were really rude. It took us 2 hour and half just for 3 sushi roll. When we pay, they add 20 percent tip!!! Never go again"}
{"text":"We visited Mido in March of 2012. $19.99 for All you can eat sushi sounds good, but the quality of the food and service leaves a lot to be desired. Without even ordering the waitress brought us miso soup, salad, edamame and a tray of sashimi. Also, we asked for free hot tea and spicy mayonnaise. We ordered different rolls, but the major upsetting thing was that they add baby carrots that smelled like they were chemically treated to almost all the sushi .We had to physically remove them from every single piece of sushi.   It was a lot of people in the restaurant and only 2 waitresses, So we had to wave and call them to our table a lot of times. In the end we asked for red bean and mango ice cream. I think it's better to pay a little more, but have better quality and service. I will not be coming back here, for sure."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good here. The service is good and their lunch special, all-you-can-eat is great. The only bad thing is, you don't just automatically get all that comes with the all-you-can-eat special, you have make sure you ask or each thing it come with i.e. appetizers."}
{"text":"$20 All You Can Eat Sushi!! It's pretty good sushi too and they give you green tea ice cream for dessert too. Yum! We'll be back."}
{"text":"So far so good! Its so hard to find places that have fresh fish around here, but Mido has it! If you get the all you can eat sushi deal, $22 per person, just start off slow and ease into it. Dont order too much you cant handle or else you'll be charged for uneaten food. We must have eaten $80 worth of sushi (x 2 ppl), you cant beat that!"}
{"text":"Just an OK place.  A little pricey, not-that-great service and average taste.  The only highlight was the fried rice with beef, I would go back just for that.  If you're in the area, it's a fair choice but I wouldn't crave it.  Although I heard that their happy hour is pretty good.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Go here almost every other day! Staff is helpful, food is delicious, couldn't ask for anything better than that! Make sure to ask for ice green tea (if you're a green tea fan) and the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"The best thing that this sushi spot offers is their $23.99 all you can eat deal. On top of numerous sashimi and rolls to choose from, you're also given a large tempura appetizer and gyoza. It doesn't end there, after you have been triumphant in eating all of that goodness you are offered a scoop of mango or green tea ice cream to sweeten your palate. If you go for your birthday and tell the server, you are in for one special surprise as the whole restaurant comes to life with disco lights and music blasting over the speakers. I would definitely embarrass the crap out of someone for a good laugh--just a little tip."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix! Pancho and his wife are the most welcoming of owners and Pancho is an incredible sushi chef! My husband and I are addicted. Their prices are amazing and they don't skimp on the fish. Happy hour prices allow you to be regulars without breaking the bank. We just looove this place. Beats sushi brokers, ra, blue wasabi hands down."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, good staff, and the price was write.  The $20.00 all you can eat sushi was right my alley.  The sake bombs were just what the doctor ordered as well.  Can't go wrong with Mido Sushi!"}
{"text":"Food is okay and worth the price for the quality served. I would have given more stars if the customer service was better. The waiter kept messing up our orders and when we spoke up to correct it, she would scowl behind our backs walking back.... Come here if you want mediocre sushi. But I don't think I would recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"If you're starving and up for a big meal but want to eat in style.  This sushi restaurant is the place to be.  You have a few selections of appetizers, lunch, dinner entrees  and dessert.   But the real reason why you really want to come here is for their all you can eat sushi.  They have a wide and very delicious selection of nigiri and sushi rolls. They also have happy hour. When your here at this place is comfortable and feels homie.   I Love this resraurant that much that I've  been here soo many times to satisfy my sushi cravings. Matter of fact this would be my 5th year coming and going to Midooooo!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant. The rolls tend to be on the smaller side compared to the chain places, but between all you can eat and their happy hour there is a great value proposition.   Going for lunch or dinner is easy and quick. They have plenty of seating, even for larger groups. The sushi come out in large boats that are great for sharing amongst the table. If you're alone the sushi bar is a great option, although it can get crowded between your drink, sushi, and sides."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for sushi in Arizona. Being a native Californian, Asian American, and mild sushi snob, I have to say that the all-you-can eat here is the best bang for your buck I've seen. For $20 in Cali, you might be able to gain entry into one of those AYCE Asian seafood buffets, where the freshness of the fish is sacrificed in the name of variety.   But at Mido, it's all about the fish. I mean, when I'm feeling ambitious I'll enjoy their crispy tempura basket beforehand. And I wouldn't miss the Japanese red bean/green tea/mango ice cream at the end. But the real star of the show is the nigiri. The quality & freshness can waver from visit to visit, but even on a bad day it's pretty good. I tend to like their salmon, hamachi (yellowtail), and white toro (fatty tuna) the best. Their rolls are good too, but I can never bring myself to order them. Maybe because I can hear my Chinese father's voice in my head, telling me to shovel as much of the expensive stuff into my stomach as I can.   Still fresh in my memory is the Sunday night when our whole party could've sworn they had just flown the fish in from Japan and delivered it straight to our table. Rich, melt-in-your-mouth goodness that's only ever been topped by my days going to Sasabune in LA with my sugar daddy/foodie friend.   Fun and sweet sushi chefs too. One time they heard I would have to drive 1.5 hours back home, and they sent me off with a free Diet Coke!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. The rolls weren't fantastic, but for the price you get what you are paying for. Good joint to head to if you are looking for large amounts of sushi. If you are looking for the best sushi in town, I would head elsewhere. The best rolls were the simplest ones (spicy tuna, salmon, etc.) and the more complicated rolls they have on the menu just didn't sit very well."}
{"text":"Delicious , I did the all you can eat sushi and is worth it if you get the expensive rolls. All I think they should do different is clean up a little more ..."}
{"text":"UPDATE :they are no longer serving complimentary miso and salad when you are seated. Still love their Pancho and Tucson rolls. ORIGINAL REVIEW :always good sushi, complimentary miso, salad, and edamame, great prices."}
{"text":"We came here once and were HOOKED! We come here about twice a week now and have never been disappointed. My husband loves the all you can eat option and I always order off the menu. Many of our friends visit often too and only say great things! Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"$19.99 All-You-Can-Eat + Happy Hour = Awesome! Happy Hour is M-S 11:30-2:30 and M-Th 5-7 where a good list of rolls are half off!! Pancho (head sushi chef) is super nice and personable. The food/sushi has been consistently good and of great quality. It's definitely one of the best sushi places with an all-you-can-eat sushi option in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I went to this sushi bar last week for happy hour with my mother directly after work due to rave reviews. While the sushi was pretty good and I liked the sushi chefs, the overall customer service was HORRIBLE!   I walked in and stood at the front and the waitress was leaning against the sushi bar across the room looking at me. She didn't walk up to say hello, nor did she direct me to an available table. So after standing around for a few mins I walked over TO her and she looked and spoke to me like I was disturbing her. I had to ask for a menu and she simply shook her hand towards the dining area when I asked for a table.   I eventually sat down at the sushi bar and waited for my mother, we ate, enjoyed the sushi but the salad (topped with a small strip of fake crab meat) and edamame (sp?) left much to be desired. When we finished our meal, oh and no one checked on us either, we sat there for 15-20 mins and no one acknowledged us. We were sitting right next to the kitchen doors so the waitresses had to walk past us to get to the rest of the customers.   I'm not sure if I'm the only customer that received this kind of treatment but I did notice the waitresses being pleasant to the people around us. As well as walking them to available tables with menus in hand.  When we paid, I wrote a note complaining about the service and intend on speaking to the manager, but I doubt that would make any difference.   I will never visit this sushi place nor would I recommend it to my large social circle."}
{"text":"If you love genuine sushi you'll love this place. I eat here at least once a week and it is one of the best Japanese restaurants  in town."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Mido a higher review. I used to like coming here; it has a GREAT value; happy hour all day on weekdays; free miso soup, salad, and edamame with your meal; pretty decent sushi, like the Pancho Roll; and really friendly chefs. I used to really enjoy Mido as a family restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  So I took some friends with me the other day when I took a trip down there. Some of friends were guys who love sushi and can eat a LOT, so they got the 20$ all-you-can-eat special (which is a really good deal). It was a disappointing experience. The sushi was very sloppily prepared and the quality of taste was none too great either. This would have been excusable, because for 20$ all you can eat, you can't really expect 5 star sushi every time. However, our biggest complaint was with the service.  There's a waitress there, an older Asian woman, who was very abrupt and brusque. Some of our friends arrived a few minutes later then the rest of us, and she took a long time coming back to our table, even though the restaurant was empty. So the rest of us had our appetizers, edamame, soup, and drinks; she came back a few times to see if we were ready to order our sushi but paid no attention to the newcomers who were lacking in drinks or any of the other stuff. Finally, when we were giving her our sushi orders, I politely pointed out that our friends hadn't gotten their drinks yet. She replied rudely, \"Yeah, I know, I already know that,\" and just walked off.  Okay, not too big of a deal. So she brings us our stuff and my friends order their first round of all-you-can-eat-sushi. They finish it off and we're given the same ticket that we marked our orders on the first time. My friends thought this would be confusing, so when they were writing down their second orders (on the same ticket that still had our first), they put darkened circles next to the second orders. The waitress took the ticket without looking at it or pausing to confirm and just whisked off.  Lo and behold, the order she brought back was the exact same rolls they had ordered the first time, not the ones they wanted to try for their second round. When we told her what had happened, she responded with extreme impatience and annoyance, pretty much just blaming us. Our friends didn't really want to eat the same rolls they had just had, so they asked her what they should do, because they were also hesitant to waste it. She said that we should just eat what we had ordered, so they were forced to eat the exact same rolls a second time.  So then they ordered a third time, because there were still rolls they wanted to try and they had paid for all you can eat. When they told our waitress that they were ready to order a third round, she acted as if we were being absurd for wanting more. She was even ruder and more abrupt and snatched the ticket out of our hands. The more sushi we ordered, the more irritated she seemed to get. Are we not supposed to order all you can eat for the all you can eat deal?...  Anyway, it was just a really unpleasant experience because of the service. The sushi was just okay, 3 stars at best, but there is a good variety of rolls at Mido that we unfortunately felt unable to try because it was like we were being persecuted for wanting to order more. Every \"round\" of ordering was only three or four rolls, two per person, so it wasn't like we were just marking up every roll on the list and stuffing our faces and eating the restaurant out of house and home. We never want to go back here, which makes me sad, because I used to really love Mido."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend here for a date night. I was excited to try this place because of all of the great reviews. It is a nice place. Located in a no name strip mall. We were greeted when we came in and seated where ever we wanted. There were not too many people there yet but it was a little early still. Very nice staff. Very friendly and helpful. All you can eat sushi for $20 is hard to turn down. I never know what rolls to get so my girlfriend made the selections. We got a Vegas roll, a Dragon roll, a Mexican roll and a Philly roll. They came out pretty quick and they were good but a few of them had a carrot in them. I have never had sushi with carrot in it. Never. I have had sushi from a few different places. It almost seemed like they ran out of something and decided to substituted carrot instead. Just as a filler. So it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Kind of disappointing after all of the great reviews. I might be talked into going one more time and see if the carrot disappears but if it doesn't then I think I am good with going somewhere else. I have been to better places and sure it might cost more but I would rather pay for quality if that is what I have to do."}
{"text":"This is my brother's favorite sushi place! We took him here for his birthday and they did an amazing job making his birthday special. They have this fun multi-colored strobe light that they turn on when they play their \"Happy Birthday\" song. It was really sweet. Also, the sushi is fresh and tasty. Their happy hour prices are cheap! My brother loves the \"all you can eat buffet\" for only $20."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and helpful. The dinner starts out with miso soup and edamame. The edamame is cold which is not my favorite way that it is prepared.  We ordered eight different roles.  The spicy tuna is just what it says spicy inside with cool sticky rice on the outside. Fish is very fresh any role topped with salmon is vibrant and you swear it was just swimming upstream in Alaska.  I wish some of the rolls like the spicy tuna would have a sliver of cucumber inside of it for some texture outside of that The entire meal was it a winner.    We walked in Full of hopefulness and empty stomachs. We left with full stomachs and expectations exceeded.   A wonderful meal and a wonderful place"}
{"text":"Our friends at AZ treated us to AYCE sushi. Honestly, LA has plenty of sushi places. The sushi here was mediocre. I mean, the sushi was good, don't get me wrong. But it wasn't \"blow your mind away\" greatness.  They give you a platter of sashimi as well. The salmon was good. Everything else tasted weird, like the tuna and yellowtail, and I think there was tilapia or something. They give you korean pepper paste and veggies to wrap and eat. That's the Korean style of eating raw fish.  The rolls were all okay too. The unagi was good.  At the end, they give you a scoop of ice cream. You can choose from red bean, mango, and green tea."}
{"text":"I love this place. They are hardcore Korean chefs and owner. You probably get better deal just order off the happy hour menu over the all you can-eat. The quality of food is great here and it's a little gem I am so glad to discover !"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how this restaurant rated as high as it does.  The rolls were bland and the AYCE deal was \"meh\".   The staff did what they could to make it a good experience making it the only reason I didnt give this place a 1.  This said please understand the AYCE covers only the sushi, no teriyaki chicken etc.  After eating at hundreds of sushi places this goes in the bottom 15."}
{"text":"Yummy (;   LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their unagi nigiri !!! I wish they didn't limit those to 2 per person. The pieces come out so big and succulent! HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH.  They have an okay selection for AYCE - mostly cooked rolls, I would prefer more fresh rolls. I don't know if its because I didn't ask or because they don't offer it but I don't think they have handrolls, I would totally like one or two!  Some of my favorite was the mido roll and the dragon roll. The rolls are decently sized with not too much rice. Their nigiri though is a little heavy on the rice. Spicy scallop is a big no because its cold cook scallop which felt a little weird.  I feel like I don't eat my monies worth for AYCE but I just love the idea of getting ALL the sushi I want.   Sashimi is also available on AYCE but only limited to a portion per person."}
{"text":"Fish freshness isn't the best of the best, but it's appropriate for the price. All you can eat option is an insanely good deal. Made to order and not buffet style. A party of at least two even gets a sashimi starter. Good Toro and Salmon, but otherwise I'd stick to the fusion sushi like their Mido roll. Service was excellent and prompt."}
{"text":"I was impressed..... Very generous portions..... Quality of the sashimi and the different rolls was pretty good..... I must say even above my expectations. Try the all you can eat for sure."}
{"text":"The best value in sushi. Come here for the all you can eat or happy hour and leave without regrets.  The all-you-can-eat menu is extensive and really anything you could want, same goes for the happy hour menu. If you are not some sushi purist or elitist get their vegas roll it's deep fried seafood heaven on a roll definitely recommend it. Their rolls are rather large. If you are not very hungry (sushi in general never tends to fill me if I order a la carte) one roll per person can actually make an impact at this place where most other restaurants will require much more.   Why not five stars? Well it's a value proposition not a hip date place or cool place to meet up with friends. Service is great though, just not the ideal atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whole family loves this place! We come every week partly because the sushi is great, partly because the service is great and partly because they have extensive hours for half priced happy hour."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE sushi and have tried an enormous number of favorites.  Mido sushi is by far the best in the area. Not to mention the half price happy hour."}
{"text":"Meh. Hubs and I tried this place after a work buddy of his suggested it. We both got the all-you-can-eat and it was ok. I guess when you choose that option the quality and quantity of rolls goes down the drain. The miso soup was pretty ick. I think we'll stick to Shimogamo from now on."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi place. They have great service and sushi is pretty good for the price. If it your Birthday they have some crazy disco lights they flip on and play some nutty sushi music . Anyway, I love this place is is close to my house and always nice people and decent sushi. great prices!!!  G"}
{"text":"I found Mido Sushi 8 years ago and it is as good today as it was when I first wandered in.  I grew up in Venice Beach, CA. when Sushi was not even on your radar and for you to write the comment you did is a true definition of being mean spirited. There is nothing day old about Mido. FRESH, FRESH, FRESH every day, ALL THE TIME!!! With all the Sushi Restaurants between Scottsdale and Chandler, I drive to Mido at least twice a week for the sushi, atmosphere and Staff. Lot of good places to choose from but this is tops on my list."}
{"text":"Don't put huge chunks of carrot in my sushi as filler! That was just the beginning. The sushi all tasted the same. One roll had the same taste as the next, mainly carrot and more carrot. While this would be a fantastic value, the sushi just wasn't fresh, flavorful or memorable at all. Service was ok. All the reviews say it comes with other stuff but ours just came with salad and soup, no appetizer or ice cream. The sake was good but not great, the other times I have had it, they were really smooth and good and this just wasn't. I am by no means an expert or know one sake from another but this was not like the other ones I have had. I wouldn't go back here on purpose. There is a lot better tasting stuff around. We tried about 5 different rolls and a couple sashimi and nothing stood out."}
{"text":"Lots of rice to sushi ratio to try and fill you up! Decent AYCE... Chefs were really cool..."}
{"text":"Good sushi for a great price. Weekdays are happy hour all day, which means half off on sushi. The staff is a little scattered at times which is why I provided the 4 star."}
{"text":"Food was great. The sushi was fresh. Meals came with a salad and miso soup. Service was slow for a weekday dinner with maybe 4 tables and 4 servers."}
{"text":"First off I would like to start off by saying if you are used to \"trendy\" sushi bars this place is not going to be for you. We have been going to Mido for about two years. The sushi is always good and the prices are fair.  They now have half off happy hour twice a day.  And all you can eat sushi for 20 bucks.  Each meal is served with fresh Miso soup salad and edamame plus Green tea, Red bean, or Mango sorbet to finish your meal  complimentary, if you started with that at other sushi bars you would be in 10 dollars deep before you got to your meal.  Some of their best rolls are, Mido roll- inside is tempura shrimp, avocado, and cucumber and is topped with spicy tuna tempura flakes and ponzu sauce.  Ray roll- Inside Spicy Tuna shrimp tempura and cucumber topped with avocado and ponzu sauce.  Over all great value, good food, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our second time here.  This time, the miso soup and salad did not make a good start to this meal.  The miso soup was overly salty (this is sometimes due to keeping the soup over 48 hours-it happens to me at home)  and the salad dressing on the salad had a burnt taste to it.  All four persons at our table noticed this.  The tofu dome sushi roll was a tasty, filled with tofu, imitation crab and avocado.  It is a shame that the pork katsu was over done and dry for it was very good our last visit.  The gyoza was oily and lacked flavor.  The service was friendly so we tipped well for that but the food was not at par this time around."}
{"text":"Well I don't do reviews much but I feel this place needs a warning. We did the all you can eat and if you like supper thin cut sushi on top of a mountain of rice then this is the place for you.. It's 20$ all you can eat rice!!! You can't even taste whats on top. Even the roll I got was a huge deep-fried rice roll... Sorry I have had lots of all you can eats and this is by far the worst."}
{"text":"With the 20 dollar all-you-can-eat sushi? nothing can beat Mido. Every time I come here, I eat toooo much sushi that it would take weeks for me to crave it again. The food overall is very decent. Sashimi can taste fishy at times, but that's no big deal since I eat a lot of fish and know that it's not really the chef's fault, it's the batch of fish that day. But they try to keep things fresh so, that's something.  Sushi rolls taste great. Service? As fast as any other Asian restaurants. Sorry if this sounds like a stereotype, but it's true."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been too!  The customer service was great!  Good happy hour prices.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"We were not impressed with this place at all. The sushi had a really \"fishy\" taste, which if you have had sushi before you know that's not a good thing. It tasted like it'd been sitting out for awhile. The only roll I liked was the vegetable tempura roll, which had no fish in it. Honestly I've been to much better sushi places for much better prices."}
{"text":"Mido Sushi is one of those unique eating places in the world where decent food and decor and atmosphere can still be had for value.  Sushi in the desert is an anachronism at best and good sushi is usually an often spoken but rarely achieved thing.  Mido delivers very good sushi. When you combine that with the all you can eat option, you have a great experience.  Most all you can eat sushi is a horror or a test of wills between you and the chef as to whether you can out last his infinitesimally slow delivery.   Mido staff are cheerful and the chefs are adept at providing tasty well done rolls and sashimi quickly without fuss.  If you are jonesing for some very tasty sushi and a lot of it, I highly recommend Mido"}
{"text":"If you want pretty good sushi for a killer deal, this is the place.  Is the fish so fresh that I can still taste the ocean?  No.  But, is it fresh enough for me to crave it and drive 40 minutes (one way) just to go eat it.  Yes.    You can do an all you can eat \"man v. food\" style sushi deal for $20 (If two or more people at your table order this, you also get a sashami platter for free).  Or you can do a half off happy hour menu that is pretty good.  Plus you get miso soup, salad, edamame and hot towels.  If sushi isn't your thing, they have a great tempura selection and large portions for hot dishes.  Great for those who are sushi lovers, and those who just want to stuff themselves silly.  Time to see how much sushi you can really eat."}
{"text":"By far, this is one of the best sushi places I've been to. The ambience is relaxing, with a touch of and an 80s atmosphere in decor. The all you can eat sushi was great. It comes with all the sushi, sashimi of choice, miso soup, salad, appetizer, and green tea ice cream. If I recall, they have halibut, one of the best tasting fish after salmon. Another favorite of mine there are those little fishing boats the sushi is served in. The sushi chefs and hosts are nice. What else is there to say? Check it out..."}
{"text":"They have very good selection! Get the $22 all you can sushi and try everything. I really love their sashimi and eel nigiri. Its best if you can go with a bunch of friends, so you can split the rolls and try more selections."}
{"text":"Love Mido...lots of great rolls, and the Japanese dinners are also tasty (my kids really like the teriyaki). Fish is always very fresh, never had an issue with upset stomach after eating here either. The all-you-can-eat deal for lunch is great to, if you're hungry for more than 2 rolls particularly. Usually quick to-go service also, which we use more than done-in."}
{"text":"BEST Sushi I had in this country this far from the coast! Good fast service and sushi bar if all the tables are full. It's good, so get there early or after prime time. Everything is fresh and well prepared. In seven years I Never had a bad meal and Never had a single complaint. Good prices and happy-hour discounts. Ichiban!  OK AMIGO!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 9pm on a Sunday.  Sign on the door said last call was at 930 which makes sense because they close at 10pm. However,  when I walked in the restaurant the manager stopped me at the door and told me they weren't taking anymore customers."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Are the happy hour rolls as extravagant as Akai Hana's HH? Debatable but leaning towards no. However, because Akai Hana is so far from my little Tempe residence, Mido Sushi is the answer to my (sushi) prayers.  Happy Hour is Monday-Thursday ALL DAY, and Friday-Saturday from 11:30-5pm. Because I'd never get my money's worth for the $23.99 buffet, I really appreciate their happy hour menu, where all rolls are 50% off.  My boyfriend get the buffet while I order a la carte from the HH menu, and life is good.  Service is super fast and the venue is nice. It's not a super bougie restaurant but much nicer than you'd expect from AYCE.  At first sight, the Pancho Roll is disappointingly small. But when I actually tried it, I discovered what the hype is all about - IT'S GOOD. The Las Vegas roll was decent, but not as good as Sushiholic's Vegas roll.  Mido Sushi is definitely going to be a weekly staple for the boothang and I. We're still sitting in the restaurant and we're already planning the next time we want to come back.  So pleased to have found this sushi joint. I'm planning on trying the Dragon Roll next time, and a handful of other rolls caught my eye."}
{"text":"Yum! Happy hour prices at great. Rolls are fresh...I can't remember all the names of all the rolls I tried but there weren't any we didn't like lol"}
{"text":"I don't know what the naysayers are going on about!  We had a lovely experience here on a Friday evening.  The place was pretty busy, so we were greeted at the door by a friendly woman, and seated at the Sushi Bar.  Hot towels were carefully tossed to us (as part of the \"show\").  The friendly Sushi Chef interacted with us right away, and took our first order for the $19.99 All-You-Can-Eat deal.  Salads and Miso Soup were brought and drink orders were taken by waitresses.  Sushi began appearing right away, and kept coming until we were sated. They do use large round pieces of carrot in their rolls, but I believe this is just their style, and not a 'cheat.' I didn't feel there was an inordinate amount of rice in the sushi.  It was all fresh, tasty, and plentiful, without delays reported by others. Service was friendly and efficient.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"$23.99 for all you can eat sushi and it's more than worth it. Not only do you get sushi, but appetizer and ice cream as well. The sushi was great, with the haha roll being my favorite. Very many rolls to choose from, and some being very distinct from the rest. As far as service, because it is all you can eat, it does take a long time to get the sushi. It doesn't help that they seemed to only have 3 people making sushi. If you come in and all the seats are filled, you're gonna be waiting for a long time."}
{"text":"I came for lunch to try out their All-You-Can-Eat sushi.  The server was nice, the sushi chefs were funny and the sushi was great.  They didn't take very long between rounds of sushi and seemed to actually encourage ordering multiple rounds.    My favorite was the Unagi Nigri Sushi and dragon rolls.  I also had the California Top Fresh Water Eel Roll which was loaded with avocado and topped with Unagi.  The deep fried Haha Roll was good as well as the spicy Mido Roll.  They nailed classic rolls such as the Rainbow Roll and Shrimp Tempura Top Crunch Roll.  I was too full to try the Chicken Deep Fried roll but have something to look forward to next time.    Excellent experience and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour sushi was really good and reasonably priced.   Staff was friendly and nice and on top of refilling drinks.  We got 4 rolls, edaname, a salad, and 2 drinks for $27.  The crazy roll was the best one, with no roll being below average."}
{"text":"Came here with my partner after googling for All You Can Eat Sushi.   First off, the restaurant looks like a in the hole bar with Sushi food. I mean I go to eat the food not the walls, I get it but it can use a more sushi spot feel to eat rather than bar.  I'm a Miso soup guy, but please avoid the miso soup if you can. It was beyond bad. Bad after taste.  The sushi it self was decent. Taste was ok. Portion was good. I'm leaving this spot a better review than expected because of the great service and All You Can Eat for a decent price."}
{"text":"One of the BEST all you can eat sushi places. Each person pays the set price and you order however many sushi rolls you please, the catch being you must finish them or pay for the roll itself. Good way to ensure people aren't taking advantage and/or wasting good food.  One time we sat at the counter and the sushi chef noticed I kept ordering spicy rolls and he made me a customized roll; so cool!"}
{"text":"Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there!   OK, well I have visited this place for years now and don't go anywhere else if I am in this area.   I like the Chef's, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I don't dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha.   The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?   I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two.   All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.   Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.   The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.   I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Sashimi plate is the best. Hats off to the chef.  He always picks great tasting catch"}
{"text":"The happy hour specials are great and the food very passable for inexpensive sushi. The waitresses are one star though. I always tip well and after the subpar service today I may reconsider visiting again. They are rude and not attentive."}
{"text":"We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. \"Oh, Okay!\" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying! The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced.  Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far."}
{"text":"I really like Mido Sushi!  I have not dined there but have bought takeout lunch many times and it was always a great deal for great food.  They are very friendly too and the place looks very nice."}
{"text":"All you can eat!!!! Great happy hour almost as good of a deal!!!!  The sushi is made fresh and is very good.  They have selections for big sushi lovers like me (Alaska roll and Uni here are the best) as well as many fried or chicken options for people like my boyfriend who don't want it raw. I wish this place was closer to me."}
{"text":"So I usually have a good experience here. The chefs are very nice as they were today, but if you're not at the sushi bar the service is much slower when it comes to the sushi. Overall not bad, but could have been much better service."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was bad. We asked the waitress how much extra it would cost to add green onions in our rolls, she told us it would be $1 for all the rolls. We double checked we would only pay a total of a dollar for all the rolls and she said yes, but when our check came, they charged a dollar for each roll....and we order many rolls. Green onion is only 50 cents in stores."}
{"text":"loves the place, great atmosphere, servivce is  always good. never  disappoints."}
{"text":"If I've this like, a 4.7 if I could. The staff is awesome (an Asian guy in his early 20s and a middle aged Asian lady were working during the times I've come in), food is crazy cheep, food is tasty, AND I didn't get food poisoning.   As far as quality of the food, you're paying for something that SHOULD BE rated at half a star BUT you're getting like, 3.5-4.5 star quality. They have all you can eat menus, happy hour at basically all hours of the weekday, and already cheap prices.  To give an example, my friend and I came here, got 7 platters of sushi (stuff like Vegas roll, California roll, etc), 6 piece each (I think). And we paid 23 dollars (before tip), of course.  It's not fine dining, so don't take the love of your life here if you're about to propose -- you'd look cheep as hell.  They have some actual Japanese food here (Their food is way different in Japan in the same way that Panda Express isn't real Chinese food), but most of their food is \"American Japanese food\".  Seriously. Amazing stuff and totally worth a try."}
{"text":"A large black bug crawled out of one of my sushi rolls.  Thinking I'd get a comped meal or at least a free sake bomb, I asked to talk to the manager.  The manager simply pointed at the bug and said \"Bad bug\" and that was that.  Never again."}
{"text":"Having grown up on a peninsula in California, I consider myself a sushi snob. Never in my wildest dreams would I think my favorite sushi ANYWHERE would be in land-locked Arizona! This place never disappoints. We will drive straight here from LA for this place. The quality of the fish is exceptional. Pancho is a wonderful guy and his staff is just as great."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night and did the All You Can Eat Sushi with a friend.  It was a great deal for $23.99.  The sushi was fresh and the selection was extensive.  I tried the mango ice cream at the end and it was delicious.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I've never give a bad reviews but their food was so awful. I order Udon soup taste of nothing like just soy sauce"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places to grab some Japanese rolls and sushi here in Phoenix.  I rarely enjoy rolls and sushi in this desert but this joint was decent to get your fix."}
{"text":"I think I found my new \"go to\" sushi place.  I visited Mido with my husband the other day based on a friend's recommendation and I am so glad I did.    My husband and I both had the all-you-can-eat sushi for $20.  As Jared said, the sushi quality is not out of this world, but it is solid (good).  Definitely a great deal for the price.   It is comparable to Takamatsu's all-you-can-eat, but I think I prefer Mido.  Like Takamatsu, the sushi is made to order and not pre-made, which is a huge plus!   There is a large list of rolls you can choose from and the buffet also comes with:  Edamame Miso soup Assorted tempura or gyoza (I recommend the tempura) Sashimi platter (If you love raw fish, do NOT miss out on this) Ice cream (mango, green tea, or red bean)  All the above is brought to you.  You can also ask for fixings for Korean style sashimi lettuce wraps (ssam, samjang, chojang).  If you love spicy, garlicky, fresh, crispy, food, I highly recommend it.  Oh and for dessert, try the red bean paste ice cream at least once.  You won't be disappointed.  All three flavors are really good, but the red bean one is the best in my opinion.  The flavors are really delicate with a hint of what tastes like rose water.  Seriously, it is really good.  Refreshing too.  A great way to finish off a great dinner.     I'm not sure if you can forgo any of the above, and I will mention that like other all-you-can-eat sushi places you will be charged if you do not finish all the food you ordered, which makes total sense.  Waste is not a good thing.  So, I recommend you take your time, just order a few things at first and order more once you finished what you have already ordered.  All-in-all this is good food and great service at a very reasonable price.  Everything about it, from the enthusiastic greeting you get from the sushi master/owner to the the generous and delicious offerings for dinner, tells you that this is a place with heart.  The priority here is to make sure you have a great experience and it totally shows!"}
{"text":"Come here monthly for the all you can eat sushi for $20pp.  Sushi quality is decent for Arizona.  You can also ask for sashimi to share if you have a large party and everyone is doing all you can eat.  For fresh fish, you want to go to a busy restaurant.  This place is definitely busy each evening weekend.  There are some sushi not available on the all you can eat sushi menu, but overall the choices are quite good."}
{"text":"So, I say to myself, \"half price sushi for lunch? Oh yeah! You betcha!\" well, even at half price, it's tough for me to get excited about thus place.   There's no real creativity (except for the disco balls during \"happy birthday\", seriously, uh yes) and it's fairly generic fare. The 2 stars are really for the fact the service was Johnny on the spot for edamame, miso and salad. The main fare though, just plain lacking. You're better off heading a mile or 2 down Ray over to Ra."}
{"text":"I really don't expect much from strip-mall sushi places in the east valley.  They are basically a dime-a-dozen and are generally just blah.  However, this place is the exception.  The first thing I noticed is that the inside is huge for a sushi place.  It is very nice and very well kept.  It doesn't look sticky and gross like some other places.  The entire staff is very friendly however our waitress disappeared 1/2 way through our meal which made getting my diet coke refills difficult.  They should really hire some more waitresses because the place gets pretty busy and with only 1 or 2 waitresses working the floor, they tend to get overworked.  Our party of 4 ordered a ton of sushi and I was amazed how fast it was put together.  I only saw 2-3 sushi chefs and the place was busy so they must be pretty awesome.  They have a great selection of sushi and everything we ordered looked to be very fresh and was delicious.  While we didn't order the always-popular all-you-can-eat sushi special; I do want to try it when I'm feeling gluttonous.  Their all-you-can-eat sushi menu seems pretty robust and has probably 30 different rolls on it.  I mean for $20 you really can't go wrong especially with the quality sushi this place seems to deliver.  I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Mido is always decent sushi. It's not a fancy place, but the quality of the fish is good, and a $5 tip in the Sushi Chef jar goes a long way. They do not load up their rolls with lots of rice then. They offer all you can eat for $24, but the half price happy hour at lunch is usually a better deal. The tray in my picture was $40 with drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here for over a year even when we lived in Tucson. We go for the Happy Hour always and so worth it!"}
{"text":"Good food, always crowded but seriously understaffed in the front of the house. If you want good sushi this is the place, consistent service, not so much."}
{"text":"bad bad choice for sushi buffet.  sashimi was thick and limited, gyozas were drenched and not crispy at all tempura was okay sushi rolls had carrots in them, carrots, seriously............ rice in sushi rolls keep breaking and coming apart, pack them full or rice and have a hard carrot piece in there and just a little bit of fish service was terrible, other than the ice tea and water refills, our server messed up our order each time we put it in.  first time, only half the sushi came out so we re-ordered, took 20-30 mins for reorder to come, again, missing several rolls, did a 3rd reorder, another 20-30 mins.  we were there for 3 hrs.  3 terrible hours, i kid u not, we will never go back here again. i rather they increased the price from 20 to 25 and give us a real decent  buffet like they used to, say about a year ago.  now its just really bad. staff were doing their best to mess up or ignore us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. We have been coming here for more than 5 years. They offer all-you-can-eat sushi which is so good and everything tastes so fresh. This place gets packed on the evenings and weekends. Staff is friendly and personable!"}
{"text":"Mido has become my go to place for sushi.  When we just want a lot of good food, the all you can eat option can't be beat.  Other times, their sashimi and the rolls not included in the special are also outstanding.  The staff is always attentive and quick to bring drink refills or put in orders for more food.  Both the sushi chefs and the servers are friendly and happy to insure everyone enjoys themselves.  Unlike a lot of sushi restaurants, Mido also has an excellent selection of other options on their menus, providing options for those poor souls who don't care for sushi."}
{"text":"This place never fails! Tonight we arrived to a full restaurant. Every seat in the building was taken and a line was started at the door. We stood for 5 minutes and we're sat at our table. Our drinks arrived in less than 5  minutes, and our sushi selection arrived in less than 10 minutes. Such great and timely service, for a full house!!"}
{"text":"Mido has been my go-to sushi spot since they were in Tucson. Yes, I used to drive all the way out to Tucson just for Mido. Delicious sushi at an amazing price.  I always order the All You Can Eat Sushi for $19.99. You really can't beat that price. And, it comes with Soup, Salad, Edamame, & Ice Cream. Yes, even Ice Cream! I understand the temptation to be skeptical when contemplating both \"value\" and \"raw fish\" at the same time. But, trust me; Mido is the real deal. Mido has better sushi than a lot of places that aren't all you can eat. It will make you a devout believer in the all you can eat sushi concept. ...Well, I can't vouch for other all you can eat sushi places; but I can vouch for Mido.  GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Sushi was OK. But the place worked out well for a large group and... well... their birthday gig is the best. They dim the main lights, crazy strobe party lights come out of the ceiling and a bizarre Engrish version of the Happy Birthday song starts bumping on the sound system. It was quite surreal, and wacky enough that it makes me want to go here for my birthday."}
{"text":"Food was slightly above average, when compared to similar sushi joints.  Small place, and if you don't show up at the right time, it gets packed quick.  Food came out quickly, but it was a nightmare trying to get our check.  The best part was the complimentary ice cream after dinner.  The Mango and Red Bean flavors were excellent."}
{"text":"An okay place... not on my top 50.  Plus, the \"chef\" used the same towel the entire time we were there- but rinsed it out in the sink as we were leaving - Humm, question the Health Department A?"}
{"text":"I found this place a year ago, by driving by. During that time I was not a huge sushi fanatic. The most adventurous thing I would eat was shrimp tempura rolls. And avocado rolls. I was really craving avocado, so I went in and checked it out. I've tried many many avocado rolls at sushi restaurants, but Mido had proven to be #1. The avocado is always fresh, and the roll is delicious! After my first visit I was hooked.   Since I found this place I go at least once a week. My sushi knowledge has expanded and now I can say I eat real sushi. I got over my fear of raw fish, and take pleasure in ordering all kinds of rolls. The ingredients are always fresh. I have yet to be disappointed, and I'm a regular. They always start you off with a miso soup and a salad. They're super tasty. The salad has ponzu sauce, which you can also order a side of for your meal.   Their prices can't be beat. It's very hard to find good quality food for a low price. They offer a 50% happy hour menu with lots of choices. Happy hour is all day mon-thu. They also offer all you can eat sushi for about $22. I usually am way too stuffed to be able to eat enough to justify it, so I stick to happy hour.  I have not once gotten sick eating here, which I can't say the same for other sushi restaurants. I always come back to Mido.   Very friendly staff, I love coming here and will continue to bring family and friends to Mido. Everyone I've brought has been amazed at the quality and prices of the sushi. Great place! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times the service and food were excellent. It turns out they have a daily happy hour for dine in guests.    Large portion sized rolls. I really enjoy the \"pop\" rolls (?). Fish wrapped in cucumber instead of rice."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends at around 8:45 p.m. just to get a few drinks, knowing they close at 9:30. The waiter approached us and immediately said, \"You know we close at 9:30, right? You are going to be rushed.\" Immediately, we were rubbed the wrong way. We usually have a good experience here. She walked away and then came back and my friend asked her, \"What do you mean by being rushed? No one likes being rushed. We want to eat here. We enjoy being here.\" The waitress then proceeded to say, \"Then, be nice,\" to my friend. Extremely rude. Never experienced a lapse in customer service like this. I normally take all things into account before assuming the waiter or waitress is being rude or not welcoming. Will not be coming back and will be telling all close friends and relatives about my experience at Mido. Unfortunate that this happened."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mido for years. Not sure why it took me so long to write this review but better late than never!  I've tried more sushi places than I care to count and Mido is by far the best. They have the best fish in town. Their all you can eat for 20 bucks is very attractive as well. I did find Sunday dinners are the freshest.  I always do the all you can eat because I get the sashimi plate. The chefs are great. If you're lucky enough to know the owner (like me!), you'll get all sorts of perks. Sashimi, items not on the menu, experimental items, it's a great perk.   The rolls are delicious, sushi is fresh and food ample. Restaurant is clean and servers can be slow when its busy but they are attentive. They used to have high turnover but for the last year or so, they've had consistent staff so good on them!  All meals come with edamame, sesame salad and miso soup. If you do all you can eat, they give you ice cream for dessert as well."}
{"text":"Update:  So, I am a regular here, and I just had the worst experience here that I ever have at a restaurant. I came in at 8:50 with 5 other friends to eat a late dinner. We sat down and the waitress approached us saying \"Just so you know we close at 9:30\" and I said \"Okay, thank you\". She came back around and said \"Just so you know, we are going to rush you.\" I looked at my friends and they were super confused and kind of annoyed she would say something like that. Since this is the place I had brought my friends to, I felt kind of responsible, and so I spoke up. I said \"oh.. well we can go somewhere else if you'd prefer. No one wants to be rushed...\" THEN. She replied in a super snooty passive aggressive tone, \"well, be nice.\" I tried to keep my cool and looked at my friends and they looked appalled that a server would say something like that to a customer. I know the owner personally, since I am a regular.. I walked up to the bar and said \"hey Pancho, our server is kind of rubbing us the wrong way.\" he said don't worry about it and to order something. i asked if there is someone else that can take care of us instead, and he said yes. I sat back down and tried to tell my friends it would all be okay, but they were appalled. We all decided it would be best to leave. I got up and said to pancho, \"i guess i'll see you here sometime with my family....thanks.\" he said goodnight and we left. so, this isn't panchos fault obviously, but if i were him  i would tell the super rude server \"you can go home if you don't want their money.\" needless to say, im never coming back here and neither is my family or friends. the good prices aren't worth feeling uncomfortable at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay, what is everyone ordering here because I recently had dinner here with my BF and we both thought it was very mediocre.   We tried 4 different types of rolls and the mixed tempura and thought everything was just okay. The best thing was the dragon roll but thats pretty hard to mess up. I usually order a baked roll of some sort when I hit up a sushi joint (ca roll topped with some sort of baked seafood with dynamite sauce) and theirs was really disappointing. They really skimped out on the baked topping. The fish was average, too. I probably wont be back since there are a few other sushi places that I feel do it better."}
{"text":"A quick update on the saga of my reviews. Last visit was most excellent, good quality, flavor and quality. Just be aware this is your outing for the night, not a quick meal before a show.   The staff is nice and the services is good, but boat loads of sushi don't grow on trees it takes time."}
{"text":"Disappointed - I had read all the great reviews, and was excited to check it out.  We've walked by there many times on our way to Teakwoods next door, and it always looked like it was crowded, and good times were rolling.  I had read that as you come inside, they throw you a hot towel for your face (kids were looking forward to this too!) but the only thing that hit me was the cold slap of reality - it just wasn't very good.  My second star was for service - they were friendly.  But the meal was not that great - the sushi was very plain, and little too close to room temperature for my taste.  I'm always hoping to find that awesome out of the way place that'll keep me out of the chains like Ra, etc., but this wasn't it."}
{"text":"I went to Mido Sushi on a Sunday night, and it was very crowded although it was a fairly large restaurant. Possibly for that reason, we didn't come across good service. Our waters were barely filled. Our orders were forgotten, and I ended up finishing my entire meal before the rest of the table got their food (I ate very slowly, and gosh, I felt so bad for my friends).   We could tell that the limited amount of waiters were trying hard to keep up, but the owners need to hire more waiters because not nearly enough attention was given to the customers.   As for sushi options, Mido Sushi had the typical variety of sushi that could be found in other places. They have an all-you-can-eat option for around $21, and bowls, bento boxes, and sashimi to name a few.   Bottom line: okay sushi, pretty bad service, but some pretty good deals assuming you're doing the all-you-can-eat (if you can eat a lot, of course). I personally wouldn't recommend the place until they step up their customer service."}
{"text":"If I could give rate this place 100000 stars I would. The atmosphere, menus, selection, freshness every thing about it is amazing. The sashimi is SO cold and fresh. Its my favorite place to eat and the best meal Ive ever had when you get the all you can eat sushi. Forever a loyal customer. Thanks for everything Mido!"}
{"text":"Definitely good sushi.  I think sometimes an all you eat has a stigma of \"must not be that good of sushi\", but I would say that's not the case here.  Actually, I saw one of the guys who was making the sushi cut into an avacado, and I guess there was something about it he didn't like so he threw the whole thing away.  Heck, I think I would have at least looked further to see if there was some part that was good.  So point being that they don't pass off bad food.  I'll definitely go back if I'm in that area.  Personable people to boot."}
{"text":"It's impressive when I went there alone. I love all you can eat sushi. They served the impressively authenticated sushi plates. I enjoyed the every single of second I ate. FYI, I ate more than 11 handrolls (about 80-90 pieces of sushi).  I will definitely go back there pretty soon like in the next week!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best sushi! It tastes great and the presentation is awesome! They have happy hour most of the time that consists of half priced sushi rolls, sake specials and all you can eat sushi for $19.99. The sushi chefs are fun and friendly. If it's your birthday, they turn on the disco ball for you. You'll have a great experience and enjoy your meal. We drive forty minutes passing numerous sushi places just to go to Mido."}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I went 'all in' and participated in the all you can eat sushi. The wait time was really long in between plates. The sushi itself was pretty decent for landlocked Arizona. I was not a fan of all the cream cheese. The fish was also obviously preserved and may even had dye in it (fish is not that color). I also had serious doubts about the ahi-tuna actually being tuna."}
{"text":"They get 2 stars because the food is okay (NOT remarkable but just okay) and the Sushi Chiefs really deserve better.  The service is the worst I have had in many years.  The place was not totally full last night when we got there as a party of 4.  After articulating our order several times, we ordered appetizers, drinks and 4 dinners.  Everyone in my family was served their dinners (no appetizers) except for me.  I did not say anything until I noticed a table of 4 that sat down after we got there were served drinks.  I asked our one of many servers (never had one consistent server) when we might get our drinks.  She said sorry they forgot them.  Still waiting for my dinner and the appetizers.  My family is almost finished eating.  I then finally ask about the appetizers and my dinner to which I was asked, \"what did I order?\"  Needless to say they forgot my order and also the appetizer.  finally after 40 plus minutes my dinner arrived and when it was brought to me, the server said. \"Tuna roll with 11 pieces of Sushi instead of 10 pieces because they felt bad about all the problems\"  That was very humorous as any other place would have probably taken if off the bill.  So here I am eating by myself while the rest of my family are finished when finally, the appetizer arrives...........the greasiest absolute worst Tempura I have ever seen served anywhere!  I need to keep going to the place I have been going for years and NOT go to a place just because it is close to home and I want to help patronize my local businesses.  I will not go back unless I hear they have gotten their act together service-wise."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for 10 years. That's all the way back to when we first started dating. A lot of great warm memories there; including getting my roommate hooked on sushi there. We got married through our years of eating there. The head chef was and is still polite.       There is a big but coming and here it is. Over the years, they began to get slower with their service. And not just on Saturday prime nights but lunch time when there was pretty much us and another couple. A lot of times they would forget the order all together or replace an order with someone else we didn't order. And sometimes, we would have multiple waitresses ask if we had wanted to order long after placing a order with another staff member. Last night was no different. I will admit and man up that I misread the menu and ordered double the nigiri. I totally deserved to pay the extra but not over $57 more for roughly half an orders worth left over. KEEP READING. If you put a 1 on the AYCE menu for sake aka salmon nigiri, it actually means two pieces. I thought it was one for one. Honest mistake there. I ordered 8 White albacore, 8 yellow tail and 8 salmon nigiri and a roll of Philadelphia roll plus whatever my wife and friend ordered. So what I actually ordered was the Philly roll plus 48 vs 24 nigiri that i thought I had ordered. I finished around 30 Nigiri plus my Philly Roll and then some of my wife's and friends plate. This means there was 18 nigiri left, 7 pieces sashimi. Not nearly a whole order. Here is where it was out of my hands. Instead of getting the 8 orders of Salmon Nigiri which I know I definitely ordered as I did the other 8 Yellow tail and white tuna, the salmon was replaced by more white tuna and yellow tail. That was the first mistake. BIG mistake given we wwaited and it finally came 40 minutes later and wrong. The sashimi came out last. For years, they usually serve it first. I had to ask twice for it to be served. The chef behind the counter (not the main head chef who greets you in Korean, again nice guy and very polite - the other older chef) was rude and kept muttering things under his breathe in a harsh tine while looking at me. His attitude was terrible. This was right after I had asked for the second time and after about 40 minutes of waiting there for my sashimi to come. We get the bill and they charged us $57 dollars more! that is about 3 AYCE amounts more and the left overs we had (as stated earlier above) was not nearly that price. I think it was outrageous to charge us half an orders of sushi (again look above for leftovers) at 3 x the amount. I could have easily slowly put the sushi and left overs in a napkin rolled it up and threw it away in the back of the bathroom, but that is not the kind of people we are. We are honest and have been coming there for years. At the same time, do not use that opportunity to severely abuse over charging a 3 -10 year customers that will not come back again. That is abuse of power. Again I mentioned that I made a reckless mistake, but whoever decided to charge us half an orders worth leftovers at 3 x the amount, you just abused all three of us and shame on you for that. There really is no way to fully make up for this, but if you (as in whoever was the executive decision maker in over charging us that absurd amount) have any decency as a business, refund us at least 2 whole orders worth. This is the kind of thing that promotes dishonesty because the next person that reads this will probably just throw all how ever many pieces of sushi away and not deal with the potential overcharge. They will instead lie, and that is wrong, but that is what this situation reinforced. I will still say that if I did it over again, I would still be honest. The question now lies, how will you somewhat make up for this atrocious taking advantage of us as customers? Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and have to say I really like this place. Not because the fish quality is amazing or the rolls are great but because it goes everything well. Nothing is really outstanding but the price and the rest is just solid For a $20 price you get miso soup, salad, edamame, choice or tempura or gyoza, ice cream and all you can eat sushi. That is a great deal and the sushi list is huge featuring a ton of specialty rolls and nigiri. I have never left this place not feeling like I got more than my moneys worth even on nights where I ate light.  As for the food like I said it is solid but not spectacular. The fish isn't bad but isn't out of this world either. It's just good. Unlike some other AYCE places I am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and I am a bit of a fish snob and won't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place. I have found some things I am not a fan of her but nothing i felt was bad quality or stale. I am a big fan of a few of the specialty rolls who's name escapes me but I think it's the mido roll and the ahha roll. Also i like there spicy scallop which I don't like most places.  The services is also good here and the place is clean. You really aren't going to go wrong for the price and really worth the try. Only reason I withhold a 5th star is because the fish is just average and at a sushi place that is my key grade. Of the AYCE places around though this one is a solid pick."}
{"text":"I have never left any sushi on my plate before, but I just couldn't finish the Las Vegas Roll -- it looked microwaved and tasted very fishy. The other sushi was okay, but not even worth the happy hour prices.   Service was slow, and every waiter makes you feel like you're wasting her time. I had to go and find my own napkins and chopsticks despite asking twice.  I wish I would have just gone to Sushi Kee."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and definitely plan on coming back! Both of my visits happened to be on Monday nights around 6pm. I went both times with my boyfriend who does not like sushi or any kind of seafood for that matter but sucks it up so I can get my sushi fix. The second time I went was my birthday and I ordered the all-you-can-eat sushi for $23.99! It was amazing! I ordered my favorite sashimi, nigiri and a couple rolls. I think I ended up ordering just over $30 worth of sushi alone so it was worth getting the all-you-can-eat. I was almost uncomfortably full. My boyfriend got the chicken yakisoba both visits and loved it. There was enough food on his plate for three meals and the price was very reasonable. The service is decent. They check on you just the right amount without ruining your date night. This is without a doubt my favorite sushi spot in the valley. What's even better is that I'm less than two miles from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Of all the AYCE in town, this one seems to be consistently the best. Service has been a little slow the last few times but when there are 8 people at your table, all on AYCE, and the place is full, I guess I can forgive. Great happy hour and lunch specials as well. Don't get me wrong, there is better fish in the area but you are going to pay for it. At $23.99 for AYCE (and it's almost the entire menu), you really can't beat it and in the over 3 years I have been going, never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Every few weeks this is a must go to. The all you can eat sushi is delicious. The only drawback - service can be slow. Know that going in, don't go in beyond starving, be patient and you will be rewarded with tons of delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Note I used to come here alot since i was introduced to it 2 years ago. I brought friends and family here numerous times because we enjoyed good service and half way decent sushi but being AYCE it was one of the better places to go. Do not go here if you are expecting spectacular sushi remember it is AYCE. Just know I have never had an issue with them until yesterday. My family went there for Valentines day and know that they have been here before and loved it. This was one of the most horrible experiences that could have been. None of the cooked food or food that was ordered for the children, came out including the soup. They brought out the Sashimi and all of the cold sushi which was fine but when asked where the cooked food was they refused to make it until all the sushi was finished, and continued to bring out the sushi. When asked again about the rest of the food so the people who didn't like the raw food and kids could eat it ended up with the waitress ended up telling us they would not bring it out and that we were going to be charged for whatever was not finished. Now I understand charging for what was not finished but to just bring out what you are able to get done first and not bringing us the rest of our food is unprofessional and unlike what they have done in the past. After this experience it was decided my family will not come back ever again and I do not plan to bring anyone here for such horrible service. I need to find a new AYCE sushi place with half way decent sushi now. Sad because I really loved coming here and was actually here a month ago with my friend."}
{"text":"Great place for your birthday. They provide icecream and lights with a song that plays. I have come her after our regular sushi place closed. The roles are good but average for a sushi place. The servers are nice but you do have to flag them down, often. parking is also full during the weekends. Othere than that, a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Place was nasty . Out of town and yelped a spot near our hotel . Inside of restaurant needs to be updated . Orders a crab appetizer that honestly tasted terrible . Chicken teriyaki was dry. The tempura batter mix they use is not quality mix . Just overall we didn't enjoy our food . Udon was soggy too!"}
{"text":"Just went to Mido Sushi on the advice of a friend and was completely blown away. As an east coast native I had been very disappointed in the quality of sushi in arizona for years, but Mido Sushi has given me new hope for when I have a sushi craving. The $20 all you can eat deal is absolutely amazing the pieces were large and fresh and the chefs do a great job of spacing out your order (make a large order and it comes in manageable fresh waves rather then one big platter thats half warm by the time you get around to it). The head sushi chef (and owner) is personable and very funny and asked me and my girlfriend a bunch of questions and sliced us off additional pieces of whatever my girlfriend enjoyed without having to put in another order as she is more picky on her types of sushi then I am. Give Mido Sushi a try both your tummy and your wallet will love you for it."}
{"text":"Definitely not the most upscale restaurant around, but the food is good & service for us was excellent. I agree with previous review that the head sushi chef is great.   We opted for the all you can eat sushi menu. You mark what you want on the menu sheet and they make whatever you want fresh to order.  You eat, then continue to order until you are full.  Sashimi is not included in the ayce price."}
{"text":"Came here with my family. Very nice place, greeted with many friendly hellos right away. Food is very good. And the owner will take care of you.  Many choices to pick from, the staff is very attentive and friendly. Will bring friends and family back."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite all you can eat sushi place! The pieces of fish on the nigiri are big. My favorite are the salmon nigiri and the spicy scallop nigiri/hand roll. The best roll is the spider and poncho. Pretty much come once every week or two!"}
{"text":"For the price I thought Mido was pretty good value. Don't come here expecting to be blown away. I mean what do you really expect for a $20 at an AYCE sushi joint in Chandler, AZ. Best advice I can give you about this place, drink a few sake bombers first then order food. I guarantee the rolls will taste way better than if you were sober.   That one thing Id come back for.. I was super keen on the tempura."}
{"text":"Okay so I made two visits here, so far. And yes, I will be going back.  Visit #1 - Dinner time I wasn't sure what to expect. When you first enter, they acknowledge your presence and ask you to seat yourself. A server then comes and takes your drink order. I ordered the green tea, which, by the way, is literally green. It is yummy. So, then another server comes out with Miso soup, crab salad and green beans. These come with any order for free. So after eating the yummy free stuff, I was ready for sushi. You can either order by the roll, or get all you can eat for $19.95. So, since I was ordering 2 rolls that added up to $18, I went with the all you can eat. I ordered the Vegas Roll, Soft Shell Crab roll and the Crazy Roll. They were all very delicious. And they staggered the delivery of the rolls. I was with my kids so I got them some ice cream. No complaints about the service or food!  Oh and when you get the all you can eat, you get a free appetizer. So, I picked the dumplings which they serve pan fried.  Visit #2 - Lunch time So, my expectations were set to order a couple rolls that cost around $12. Well, wouldn't ya know it they have a lunch time special where all rolls are half off. I ordered 5 rolls for $20 (lunch was for 2). They have special menus pre planned for the all you can eat and half off lunch specials, but if there is a roll that isn't on the list, for the most part you can ask and they will make it. Just make sure to tip the chef. I ordered my usual rolls plus the dragon roll. Yummy!"}
{"text":"A friend and I have been going to Mido for lunch for about 3yrs now, we've always enjoyed the food.  Decent food / decent prices.  We've always found the fish to be fresh and the rolls to be flavorful.  We both love the dressing and the fact that you get the soup, salad and some edamame to start.  The rolls are pretty standard fare, but they're consistently good.  The chefs are very friendly and do a nice job, however the wait service can be a little...confused at times.  We've had 3 different people serving us up front, but then we have to hunt someone down to put in another order or get our check.    Definitely a nice place for lunch, not your S-dale trendy (bleck) kinda place but more of a good neighborhood joint where you get what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Finding something not to like here is difficult. The atmosphere is pretty typical, the service was prompt, polite and friendly, and the food was fresh and top-notch. Soup, salad, appetizer and all-you-can-eat sushi for $20. This is a must-try. If I absolutely have to find a complaint, it would be that the gyoza seemed to be microwaved. Eat here. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The thing I love about Mido is that I can order all you can eat and still get high quality fish!  Also, they don't have a lot of rules about what you can and can not order (I had sashimi which is typically unheard of for all you can eat)!  Also, the sushi chefs are great and treat you like family."}
{"text":"Small strip mall place that is weirdly decorated with a mix of traditional ink on rice paper drawings and multicolor disco lights that they kick on for your birthday. Hostess was gracious and owner behind the sushi bar. This place maintains a highly dedicated following with locals. All you can eat option is $22...easily the best deal here given you will hit that cost basis with two rolls. Add a single starter to that and you are at $27 bucks...so go with the all you can eat. Serenity is not the name of the game as the birthday music and color lights really destroy the chi. The quality of the fish more than make up for it. Well balanced rolls and fish with enough rice to fill you but not excessive rice. Tempura, guyoza and shumai are included in AYCE. PRO TIP: non roll options here are served as two pieces. So if you write one, you get two. Just like Little Ceasers. So I wanted two masago but got four. My gal wanted two but got four. So she ate her two..... and you-know-who gets to eat six of them. These are fishy goodness but too much of anything is just too much of anything...Sushi chef missed part of our order....the unagi. The one thing on the menu that is limited to one per person per order. However we were so filled with what we ordered we were glad this did not come. All in all a good experience as good as any other sushi stuff-o-rama. Creativity is good here but sushi is sushi. Appetizers of fried calamari were the best in show. We had a couple of pieces of roll left over and the waitress didnt freak out and make us pay. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Mido Sushi has a $20 all you can eat Sushi Buffet.   It includes tempura or gyoza, sashimi plate and other appetizers.  The options for the Sushi selection is quite wide.    The first thing that was obvious is that the tempura/gyoza, sashimi offering is quite large.  It's a full plate of tempura with 5 or 6 vegtables and two shrimp.  The gyoza had five pieces.  The sashimi plate had 5 or 6 different fish with 5 or 6 slices each.    However, the taste and quality of the food was just so so.  The tempura was soggy rather than crispy.  The gyoza was oily.  The sashimi plate didn't have a lot of flavor.  I ordered Unagi, Albacore and the Mido roll.  All were ok, but not must haves.    The service was excellent and everyone was friendly.   Although I had left over food, there wasn't a charge.  Great place if you are on a budget and starving, however if you want quality sushi and willing to pay for it, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place. Great for gluten free people! My wife has celiac disease and they are extremely accommodating and have a good gluten free menu.  If you're looking for artisanal sushi, don't come here. It's delicious but I normally stick to happy hour (all 1/2 off) or all you can eat: salmon everything! Best bang for your buck is salmon nigiri.  Service is prompt and friendly and accurate and fun. It's a great place to go on a casual date. Say hi to Pancho when you stop by, he's the bomb."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials that start at lunch time and run thru the afternoon. Everything seemed fresh and well prepared. Free soup and salad, but a sign said that deal will end soon. Portion size on nigiri tuna was a bit small, but for the happy hour price it was fine."}
{"text":"The salmon at this sushi house is TO DIE FOR.  Salmon Kama, Salmon sashimi, I Love Salmon Roll.... all of which are dreamy!  The kama is crisp on the outside and lusciously velvety goodness on the inside.  The sashimi is divine and melts in your mouth.  The salmon rolls are quite tasty too, if you're in the mood for sushi.   On the other hand, I'm not  a big fan of their non-salmon sushi, and the seaweed salad is a little underseasoned.    Anything fried is good though - soft shell crab, tempura, etc.    There's all you can eat for $20, but with almost every hour of every day being half-off happy hour, there's always a good deal to be had here ;)  [Additionally, they have listings on restaurant.com too]"}
{"text":"AYCE SUSHI!! This place is the bomb. You can order as many rolls, sashimi and nigiri as you'd like. It's 23.99 per person which isn't too bad when you think most rolls are about $10 each and if you get 3, you're getting your money's worth. The fish is fresh and the rolls are definitely not small so you don't feel like they're trying to skimp on the quality and quantity which is nice. I think the main sushi chef is typically there and he'll say things like \"oh chimichanga!\" and give you a nice \"Oi!\" when you walk in and this place is just cozy and friendly. I can't say anything bad at all! So glad to have found a spot like Mido!"}
{"text":"I always appreciate and support small own businesses!  Mido is no different.  I don't eat much Sushi, but when I'm hanging with Ms. Tang seems like we always do Sushi.  I don't do the ordering since I'm such a novice Sushi patron so I eat whatever she orders.  Tonight - White Tuna Albacore, Octopus, Shrimp Roll w it's head fried, Squid Salad, miso soup, edamame, and my nemesis Uni!  I can't handle Uni -- the texture really throws me off and the taste of the ocean from a slimy gushy slab of Sea Urchin is not fun for my palate!  Everything else works, definitely loving the Octopus with a thinly slice of lemon on top - Yum!  Plus, gotta say my all time favorite is the fried shrimp head -- Yes, Andrew Zimmerman would be proud of me.  Service was excellent.  I got a tip of the hat from the Sushi Master -- I hope that's a good thing.  Overall they were attentive and quick.  The decors were traditional Japanese and what you would expect from a small sushi joint.  Definitely, think an anime flare would do it some good haha!  Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, and some Escaflowne would give it some up to date generational kick! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to say that this place has improved their service.  Friendly but to the point.  I like that.    They have the fishy salad, its kinda pricey at 5 dollars... but I really like it so I don't mind - plus, I would share it so I don't pig out too much.  Lunch special is really good.  8 pc Cali roll, 1 pc each salmon, yellowtail, tuna, eggroll, 2 pc pot stickers, pork katsu, 1 pc fried imitation crab.  Plus you get complimentary miso soup, small sesame dressed salad and edamame.  All for 8.99!"}
{"text":"It was the first time I tried this place. It was good. I really liked how the Eel was cooked for the sushi. Not over cooked thankfully. I was a bit disappointed with the white tuna nigiri , Albaquerque- it was partially cooked which took it away from the real sushi taste. Otherwise the tuna, salmon (I forgot what the sushi was called) but the combination was great."}
{"text":"We went for the unlimited sushi but ended up waiting around for way too long for our food. Just a truly ridiculous amount of time. I felt like the sushi was below average as well. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI. It's $20. If you think you will spend at least $15 for sushi at some other restaurant, just come here. Eat until you explode. And the thing is, the sushi is pretty good!  I usually don't prefer sushi restaurants that is not run by Japanese people but this is fine. They do a good job. The order for all you can eat can be rolls, or nigiri pieces. If you ask nicely and have a large group, they may even through in sashimi.  Don't be dumb. Come here for you sushi. Unless you are planning to spend less than $15. Then go to Teharu down the street. Wow, I just saved you a lot of money."}
{"text":"My fourth time here and I have to say the best.  The rolls were perfect temperature, so fresh and my date was duly impressed.  Thank you Pancho and staff for an excellent dinner.  You have a new regular!"}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles and craving sushi, I looked for a sushi fix this place with 4 stars. However, on walking in and smelling a fowl smell and then being given a salad which consisted of iceberg lettuce, peanut oil and soy sauce dressing, I knew this would be interesting. The fish was not fresh at all with a very pungent odor and inconsistent cuts on mounds of white rice. The eel was so thick and long it created an odd consistency in my mouth. I moved on to the rolls which were subpar at best and then gave up tossing cash on the table to get out of there and go find something to get the God awful taste of old fish out of my mouth. I am disappointed to say the least. If the locals see fit to give it 4-5 stars, so be it. I will drive 4-5 hours to Midori Sushi in LA, as should all of you! Educate your pallets, Chandler. This is not sushi!"}
{"text":"Poncho is amazing, sushi and service top notch and the all you can eat option is such a good deal you can have a nice sushi night out for under 80 bucks"}
{"text":"This place is one of those places you go to when you want sushi but don't feel like paying normal price. Their rolls are really ricey to the point they all end up tasting the same. The service is great and the sushi chefs are HILARIOUS! if you go in, tell them its your birthday! you will LOVE the surprise!  The place inside isn't all that great, and the servers have a difficult time understanding what you want. The 19.99 all you can eat deal is amazing though! Make sure you order sashimi if you're trying to get any fish at all... because like I said earlier, their rolls are more rice than anything!  Always remember, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The rolls were small and overpriced. The fried rice was bland, but did have a lot of chicken in it. You don't get any miso soup or salad like at similarly priced places, but you do get a small amount of cold edemame. There are no good specials and the happy hour doesn't include dinner.   Ambiance is nice, staff was attentive, but the food isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Orange roll, mido roll! This place has the greatest sushi for the money I've had in town. The mido roll is my favorite roll ever. I'm not the most experienced sushi eater, but I've had enough now to tell quality for the money, and this place delivers. Like another reviewer said as well, I too drive 40 minutes one way just to get there. Maybe Mido needs to start a caravan service or start another location farther north? :-)"}
{"text":"Service is awesome here and presentation is gorgeous. However the food is mediocre. I ordered the pancho role, the special role, and chicken fried rice. All of the food was good but not quite what I was expecting. Their happy hour also ends a little early compared to places around."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite sushi joints. Mido, why are you so far from me?   They do all day happy hour and all you can eat sushi. Their sushi is fresh and delicious.   The Philly, Vegas, Mexican, spicy tuna, unagi rolls are the best. And miso, salad, and edamame comes with your sushi at no extra cost.   Now I'm craving sushi!! I love you Mido!"}
{"text":"Came for AYCE- great selection of sushi/rolls/hand rolls. They serve you salad, miso soup and edemame. The fish was fresh and good portions. Sushi chefs are on point! Great service and the girls are super nice- 5 stars!!! Oh and the saki bombs are Bomb.com!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour sushi at this place is good (although the selection that the half off applies to is small). The real reason why my wife and I come here is for the all you can eat sushi.   They give you sashimi up front, a dessert in the end (red bean ice cream), and your choice from a large selection of nigiri and rolls.   I love their soft shell crab rolls and shrimp tempura rolls (make sure you tell them to hold the cream cheese).  My wife loves their eel and mackerel nigiri, although even though it's all you can eat, they allow only one order of eel per person (super bummer there).  Overall a good sushi place to hit up."}
{"text":"If you enjoy crack in your tempura sauce, this place is for you. If you also think you can stomach massive amounts of raw fish and other such items involved with sushi, and only have $19.99 in your pocket... well then that's weird that you have exactly $19.99 in your pocket.  Actually, I'm usually freaked out by All You Can Eat sushi, like it shouldn't really be a mass quantities-type food. But Mido has made me a changed man. It was better than some sushi places that are not served in mass quantities. And seriously... that tempura sauce. It's pretty... awesomely good/awesome.  AND, if it's your birthday, they play you the \"Hoppy Bahsday\" song and you get party poppers! PAARRTYYY POPPERRRS!!! What more could you possibly ask for?!?!"}
{"text":"Mido Sushi! I can't believe I haven't already written a review about my favorite \"discounted and very affordable\"sushi place. Where else can you go during happy hour (which is pretty much all day until 7 PM) and get a California roll, unlimited edamame, a sesame salad, iced tea AND a delicious bowl of ice cream for under $10?  My \"bestie\" (hi, Dana) and I like to go for our monthly (sometimes bi-monthly) visit to Mido. We like to sit at the sushi bar and be entertained by \"Pancho\" and his sidekick. He cracks jokes and speaks Spanish (go figure) to us while we PIG OUT on the \"all-you-can-eat\" special with all their freebies. $26 bucks (after tip) and we have to roll our overstuffed selves back to the car.  Excuse me now while I add this to my reviews list of \"Places I like to go with or without friends\"."}
{"text":"Mido came to me highly recommended by some friends of ours. By the end of the night he was apologizing to me, when it should have been the restaurant staff.  Our evening started smoothly enough, we had a party of 10 and they seated us promptly which was good. The waitress who came around the first time didn't understand my drink order the first time I gave it, so I repeated it and there was no further issue.  Then came time order sushi, our party was doing the all-you-can-eat deal, so we asked for separate ordering slips so we could keep the tickets separate. The waitress did not understand what we were describing to her and became flustered and panicked (English was not her first language) because they apparently keep everything on one ticket typically. Which would normally be fine, but I needed to make sure my own orders were clearly segregated because I have an avocado allergy. So the lady summoned another waiter to us and I had to explain that we wanted to keep the tickets separate and why, it was no big deal.  We ordered sushi, and for my two sons we ordered chicken dishes off the normal dinner menu. While we waited, a sweaty glass was fumbled by a combination effort of the waiter and my eldest son trying to rescue it. Nevertheless, broken glass and ice water covered my boy and our table. Waiter came back with towels to clean up, it wasn't really clear that it was anyone's fault, just frustrating.  Then our orders began to arrive. Our entire table of 10 got all of their sushi, but my boys' dinners were missing. My younger son is 3. We weren't about to eat in front of him.  HALF AN HOUR goes by and we don't have any staff visit our table...for drinks, to check on us, or anything. I flag down a girl who wasn't our waitress and try to discreetly tell her we were still waiting for two dishes for my sons.  The waiter came back a moment later and said he was sorry and that he forgot them and they'd be out in a few minutes. I was without words.  When their dinners finally arrived, my sushi had been sitting on our table for 40 minutes, and was considerably closer to room temperature than I would have liked, but I made my own decision not to eat while my children waited. The food was pretty good, not the best by a longshot, and some of their rolls are made in ways inconsistent with dozens of other sushi restaurants that I have frequented in the past. If this review were solely for the food, I would say 3.5-ish stars.  Our second order of AYCE Sushi takes a little bit long, but by this time the restaurant is crowded, and I can literally see how fast and frantic the sushi chefs are working, so I don't cause a fuss.  When the last order finally arrives, we sit and chat for another 15-20 minutes or so while no staff visit our table, we flag someone down and request the bill. Then, gold strikes and some other woman who we hadn't seen yet before comes to our table with a notepad, asking every person what they ordered before we could get the bills for our party. I bit my tongue and complied and rattled off everything I ordered, not mentioning the unacceptable delays for my childrens' dinners as I was confident someone had brought it to their attention already. But the question remained; Why were we telling them what we ordered? It wasn't \"OK who had the philly roll, ok and who had the sake bomber...?\" etc, it was \"what did you have?\" as if she had no idea and nobody wrote anything down from our original order or that the tickets that we deliberately asked them to separate so they could, you know, make this part easier for themselves, had disappeared.  Then came the bill. Full price charged for the order, even the late forgotten meals, plus 18% gratuity added on.  I walked straight to the cashier, pointed at the gratuity and said three words clearly and softly. \"Remove. This. Please.\"  I gave him my card, signed, and left.   I am beyond pissed and I am not going to return.   TL;DR: - First waitress had a panic attack over keeping my no-avocado allergy order segregated from others - Glass of water broken onto our table and my sons. - Forgot my kids' orders-were 40 minutes late to our table. - Wait staff visits to our table infrequent, often had to ask for other passers-by for assistance - Completely clueless about what our table ordered. We had to tell them everything we ordered as if the original order tickets were lost - 18% auto-tip added on when it not only shouldn't have been, but I should not have been charged for my kids dishes after having to wait to eat. - Never going back. This is not a 4-star establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come eat whenever you want all you can eat sushi. Their sushi last was pretty awesome, had a lot of things that not a lot of places offer for the all you can eat. Place was clean, and the service was good. The fish is definitely fresh and super delicious! Will come again whenever I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Rolls are teeny tiny itty bitty. Freshness level is good. The complimentary salad is gross, their dressing is literally soy sauce. They also put smelly imitation krab on the salad.   Verdict: There are better options."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It's comfortable, staff is wonderful.  My server,  Sara was quick with a smile and helpful explanations.  Pancho the sushi chef is friendly and full of jokes.  This is the beat sushi ive ever eaten. The sesame dressing on the salad was delightful.  The miso soup has a gentle but delicious flavor.  if you want to enjoy a night out in a family atmosphere with the best food for your money - MIDO SUSHI"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat sushi.  We come here at least a couple times a month.  It's inexpensive but REALLY delicious.  Try the pancho roll."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious sushi, and AMAZING prices if you go during Happy Hour. Being a petite girl, I don't have the stomach capacity to make proper use of their All You Can Eat deal, but if you're a person who can eat a lot, do it. During busy dinnertime, the service isn't great - you're going to have to flag the waitresses down for your order and check, though they're good about refilling drinks - but I would honestly chalk that up to Asian custom, since in my experience, waiters and waitresses in restaurants overseas are not big on hovering at your table. Going during lunch time is a treat, because then the waitresses are nicer and the chefs take good care of you. I really recommend this place if you're looking for some quality sushi on a budget.  Do take the time to chat with the chefs if you're sitting at the bar and ask them what they'd recommend (so much variety - try new things!), because they're really nice and helpful and might even treat you to a new bite or two."}
{"text":"So many good sushi places......this is not one of them! The cold edamame should have been the first clue and it went downhill from there. The sushi is cheap (happy hour starts at 11 am?) but who wants discounted bad sushi? We had no idea.....just yelped a nearby sushi place and Mido came up with 4 star average. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went here to meet a good friend. This is one that really should be 3 1/2 stars but they were very nice so I'll add the half.  I liked this place alot. They have a good deal as well as I my sushi came with edamame, (sic) miso soup, salad, and green tea ice cream. We ate alot and for 2 of us it came to about $30.  I liked that alot.  The chefs and the service were very friendly.  I had a Ray Roll which was alvacado, spicy tuna, and in fact is was some of the best sushi rolls I ever had.  So why only 3 1/2 stars?  Well this will sound weak, but I just wasnt in love with the decor. The lighting is too bright and the place looks like it would just be average.  The presentation is also done on fast food trays.  It just seems for sushi that good that the ambience would go along with it.  So anyway... Try this place out.  It works very well."}
{"text":"So GOOD! Authentic Japanese sushi and sashimi. The all you can eat menu is so fun. Atmosphere is very nice too. I will never settle for any other sushi restaurant again!!"}
{"text":"This is the pinnacle for fresh sushi, great portions, and some of the best customer service I have ever seen in my life. The literally give you miso and a salad with crab and ponzo sauce as you sit. Get the all you can eat sushi! their Salmon sashimi is incredible, I cant believe this place isn't a 5/5!!!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special there yesterday.  Price was reasonable but, i wouldn't consider it my fav."}
{"text":"Great service, best all you can eat Sushi in the valley. If your not into the all you can eat they have 1/2 price happy hour Monday thru Thursday All day. The sushi chefs are fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Came during lunch for the all you can eat sushi with 2 other people. It wasn't the best I've had but it wasn't terrible. The rolls were light on rice which was good, but the nigiri had quite a bit of rice with it. I felt like most of the rolls were rather fried or had fried crunchy topping on it which was too filling. I have had better fish though.   Service was light as well, they didn't have many servers so they didn't come by that often. Luckily we came before the rush so it wasn't as bad."}
{"text":"1/2 price sushi all day! Sushi happy hour is what they call it. Pretty sweet deal! Not a fan of the soup and salad that is served at the beginning. Ordered spicy tuna, tempura shrimp roll, dragon, and another roll I have since forgotten. Good service. Pretty good sushi."}
{"text":"Great sashimi and sushi!  Always fresh, and and great service at the sushi bar.  I have tried many places around the Chandler, Tempe area, and this is still my favorite.  Generous cuts and the guys making the sushi are very friendly.  If they could improve the decor a little, and get more consistent with service, they would be 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"I don't understand the infatuation with this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong rolls?  My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday evening. We both got the all you can eat special ($20/each). The edamame was cold and not salted... I've never seen that. It's free and all, but I'll pass on that if I ever come back. The miso was okay, nothing special, and the salad was lacking. Luke warm, limp lettuce topped with a flavorless ginger dressing. It's only saving grace was the tiny, yet delicious, piece of crab on top.   The sushi was mediocre and definitely not something to write home about. The only roll worth mentioning was the Mido Roll, which was rather delicious.   I won't be back, even if the prices are temping. Check out Sapporo in North Scottsdale. It's got the best sushi in the valley."}
{"text":"It's All You Can Eat Sushi for 25 bucks.  Granted you dont' get the best selections, but whatever.  I'm here to scarf down food, not indulge myself in some pretentious food criticism about style and flair.  The fish was fresh, didn't make me sick all day, and as far as I can tell, I'm not infected with worms.  Of course like most AYCE sushi places, the food begins to taste exactly the same after awhile, but it's fun to just scarf and wonder how much food you've could have spared to some starving family, but alas, I enjoy the benefits of capitalism.  There's cooked options for the AYCE as well, so if you don't like raw fish, it's another option."}
{"text":"Few restaurant owners are worthy of me following them to other cities.  I live in Tucson and came to Phoenix and as a result I had the opportunity to enjoy the way Pancho expertly prepares his dishes. A mere 20$ for all you can eat is a steal and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this establishment as I wish he still had a place in Tucson."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for at least 8 years now and usually do the ayce sushi which has a ton of different rolls you can choose from! It's nice that the ayce option includes tempura, a little salad, miso soup, a plate of sashimi, and ice cream for dessert! Just a warning, the ayce is not ayce sashimi but includes a plate that scales with however many people you have. It is unfortunate they raised the price from 19.99 to 21.99 because now the cost is 25+ with tip and tax vs. A price south of 25 which makes me feel like it's alot more expensive even that's it's just $2 more! Most the rolls here are pretty good and I enjoy the dragon roll, caterpillar, Pancho, mido, and soft shell crab roll amongst many others! I would not recommend the avocado roll cause it's literally just avocado and rice... My challenge when I get the ayce is to order enough to get the sushi delivered in a boat, and while many attempts have been made, only a few have come to fruition!   This used to be my go to sushi place but then I discovered Akita sushi which has a 11.99 lunch buffet, however it is a bit far from chandler(it's in Scottsdale) and it doesn't come with sashimi for lunch. If it's your birthday they have a disco ball and flashing lights that come out that's always fun!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! The staff is friendly and the food is amazing! The sushi chefs are creative and funny and we always leave happy!"}
{"text":"Just came in with friends. This was my second time being here, we came in with 40 minutes until closing time. Our server told us to shed be rushing us the whole time because it was close to closing time. I asked if she would prefer us to leave and she said no but that she would still be rushing us. My friend mentioned that we don't necessarily want to be rushed and that we just want to enjoy dinner and we still had a lot of time. Our server then told her to \"be nice then\". We decided to leave."}
{"text":"Best we've had in Chandler so far. Because we don't exactly live close, we were only able to go a couple of times. However, each visit was excellent, and the fish was so fresh. The owners are very friendly and made sure that we had everything that we needed. The sashimi is great and the rolls are good too. Clean inside the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST PLACE to get your sushi fix! I am so spoiled by the fantastic quality that they provide for such an amazing price. Consider me ruined with regard to any other sushi joint.  $20 for All You Can Eat top notch sushi!  This place is well worth the drive to get there. Meal comes with salad, miso, and ice cream to finish it off (green tea is my favorite).  Be sure to order the sashimi plate prior to your rolls.  You will not regret it. Best cuts of a variety of premium fish all served atop a bed of shredded radish. The staff is very friendly. Be sure to tip your sushi chefs handsomely at the end of your meal. By the time you finish your meal, you will agree that they earned it! This place can get very busy and they do not do reservations. Please plan accordingly! It is well worth the wait. :) They do have happy hour and serve standard dishes if you are not into sushi."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat sushi for $19.99 per person--and the sushi is pretty damn good.  I'd give it 4/5 in terms of taste and quality.  Very pleasant and helpful staff.  Nicely-decorated interior.  Yes the other reviews are correct--they do use veggies as \"filler.\"  But for the price and taste you will be very pleased.  We ate so much we didn't have to eat anything else for the rest of the day.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Great place. Been going here for a few years now. Best all you can eat option around Phoenix area. Price is really good as well. Would recommend to anyone who loves sushi."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I visited some family in Arizona recently and told my cousin I recently have come to really enjoying sushi. She's a big sushi lover so she brought me here! I fell in love! I came here two out of the four days I was visiting Arizona! When I go back to AZ I definitely will be coming here again! I ordered the rainbow roll, dragon roll, baked lobster roll, and another roll but I forgot the name. The second time I came we got different types of sashimi (all very tasty and very fresh), seaweed salad, and some rolls. Also, the waitress had brought us our checks early the first time I went but I actually wanted to order the green tea ice cream. She felt bad so she gave me the dessert for free! If you're thinking about coming here, then please do so!"}
{"text":"Mido Sushi! Also known as Sushi Hama from Tucson AZ..  I have been their fan since 1999.. I remember taking long drive to Tucson to savor their \"spicy scallops hand roll\"!  Yumm..  its making my mouth watery!! LOL!    Now, they are here .. $20 all you can eat!!  plus miso soup, salad, tempura, and three choices of ice cream for desert, mango, red bean, and green tea..    I have tried many different sushi places in AZ and Cali.. but I have to say..  Mido sushi is always my #1 choice..     Did I mention all you can eat for $20?? =  )  Try it, and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is average. Service is ok. This is the closest sushi restaurant in my working area."}
{"text":"I walked into a pretty empty place was told to pick a table. I ordered  the all you can deal for $19.95 wait staff very friendly and chefs in the back pretty fun. First round came with the house salad and a plate of edamame and the miso soup. It was all really good I ended up ordering the Mexican Roll, California Top Spicy Scallop Roll, Jose Roll and the Gyoza Roll all really fresh. My only complaint was my water never got refilled the whole time I was there and the wait staff looked confused at times."}
{"text":"Ive been a fan of mido for a while, not because of their food but because of the fast quick service.  But this past week, when i visited will be the last time i will ever go here...  First i walk in with my son who is now 11 months old.   Stood there by the door for a while until someone i asked how many...I asked for a table for 3 and a baby. Which normally mean highchair. I was told to sit in a empty table by the wall.   I sat down. After alittle over 15 mins, no high chair, no water, no menu... I admit the place was busy and packed. But that is no excuse for not even looking at the customer and asking for a drink.  Another 10 mins or so passed, i finally got the highchair and got to order drink. Not hard, hot tea and water.  Hot tea came by another waitress but no water...  Even after my dates came, we waited another 20mins or so to order!  I got to the restaurant at 7 and got to order at 8:10ish! Not only that, we never got miso, salad or edamame which is included in the all you can eat.  I asked for the soup twice for my son, nope... No soup. The sushi arrive and we ate most of that since we waited so much!   Then she gave us the check no questions asked... Really? You wanna take our money after non existent service?   I will not be going to mido ever again."}
{"text":"Suggest getting the all you can eat sushi. Good quality sushis! And really worth the money when you go in groups because well, it's an all you can eat."}
{"text":"The sushi is great and the prices during happy hour are even better. Get the Pancho roll and the tempura. The udon is a good choice as well."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is always good an sushi chief poncho always makes your night great. He is such a character. Great place for a happy date night. Thanks again poncho for the laughs"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious food. If you want non expensive but amazing sushi come here during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I went there with my husband last Friday to celebrate our birthday and we both ordered unlimited order$22 per person. Unfortunately, we waited their service quit of longer than we think. Every time we order sushi we need to wait between 25-30 mins which is depend on how fast they are make the sushi so if you are going on Friday or weekend you need to spend 2 or more hours to eat 2 plates of sushi .So unlimited order and the money you spent per person $22 it is not worth."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for dinner with my family. The service is alright, but when they are busy it is understandably slow. They do check up on you when they aren't busy and food comes relatively quickly. First you get complimentary edamame, miso soup and salad, then your order comes shortly after. The baked scallop roll is warm and flavorful, the sashimi is usually fresh and the udon has bouncy noodles. The tempura is crisp and delicious as well. I've also had a wide range of their rolls and they all taste relatively good for sushi in Arizona. The all you can eat is a really good deal since you can get 3 rolls and make it up as it is only $19.99. If two people get it you can get a sashimi plate with a variety of fish.  This place is  a very good deal and pretty good sushi for Arizona."}
{"text":"My pregnant coworker brought me to this place for happy hour. Reminds me of LA Sushi joints. Scented warm towels when you arrive. Free* Miso Soup, salad, and edamame.... Then half off sushi rolls! Yes please. Service was attentive, but casual. The guys rolling the rolls at the sushi bar were super interactive, and seemed really happy to just be alive. They made the energy of the place really positive. My friend and I ordered 5 sushi rolls... and some nice hot green tea. Each of our bill, out the door with a (hefty) tip included?... $15.00!   Way better than corporate, chain, run by all white americans sushi joints (cough RA Sushi)....   Go try it!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi with an awesome 50% off happy hour. Can't beat $3 sake bombs. The salad has a nice ginger dressing. The soup is kind of bland but the rolls are huge. We come back to Mido often!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that you could get delicious sushi made with fresh, flavorful fish in the middle of the desert? Not me...until I went to Mido Sushi.  I've been making the pilgrimage here for several years and each time it's been consistently good. All-you-can-eat sushi, made to order, with a variety of different rolls included along with soup, salad, edamame -- and sashimi and ice cream for dessert if you request them.  For non-sushi eaters (poor things), they do a great job with tempura, gyoza, and teriyaki chicken and beef. They also have a wide variety of drink specials (sake bomb for $6.00!).  The staff is efficient and friendly. And if it's someone's birthday, the disco ball gets lit up to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.  The rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not very good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.  Having said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  Thanks for listening to a simple request.  One thing that was pretty fun about Mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  Once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  Way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff."}
{"text":"The sushi is great and the prices are unbeatable. Their happy hour is half off of almost all sushi and the happy hour is available almost all of the time. Each guest gets free miso soup, sesame dressing salad, and edamame. You can have some ice cream at the end if you have room left. The service is good and everyone is friendly. I highly recommend the Mido roll and the Fried Jalapeno Yellowtail roll. The Gyoza roll is also delicious."}
{"text":"Craving sushi so an all you can eat sushi place seemed like the perfect idea. The best way I can describe my experience is hit or miss. The soup and salad was a total miss. Sour was all that was eminating from the afore mentioned, overpowering the bland greens. Bring on the AYCE sushi please. Amazing, mostly, with a couple of misses. Delicious, great combinations of rice, fishes, deep fried rolls, and other sea dwelling inhabitants. My biggest complaint, lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great quality and excellent customer service!! Best Value in town for all you can eat sushi it doesn't sit on a tray they make it for you fresh"}
{"text":"All U Can Eat Sushi menu for under $22.  A great price yet the quality is what you pay for and the menu is restricted to the first two pages for sushi rolls along with some nigri selections.  It comes with a cup of miso soup (terrible) and a side salad (iceberg lettuce with their house dressing), choice of gyoza or tempura (very greasy) and a few ice cream selections. There are restrictions on eating everything you order (including the thick rice served with your nigiri selection) otherwise you will be charge for it.  If you don't want the all you can eat sushi then they do have a number of different sushi rolls to choose from around $8.50-$9.50 a roll. You can order a large beer and small sake for $6 so if you just want to grab a drink, then go this route.  I had better hot sake but it's more economically to get the sake bomber if you want a large imported beer (rarely can you go wrong with bottle beer).  I gave this restaurant a 3 star, not for the food, but the service was friendly and it was minimum wait time on a Friday."}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful.  I have a friend who's recommended we all go there many times.  Usually when you think \"sushi buffet' I think of the other places that service sushi and stick it under a lamp.  Not my cup of tea.    We show up, they sit us quickly and bring out the drinks, soup and edimame.  We all agree we're here for the all you can eat and begin to load up the order slip. Shortly after, they bring out this boat with all sorts of sushi.  We ate until we were nearly exploded.  It was a delight!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome, i ordered four shrimp rolls and 6 California rolls (i didn't notice the number in parenthesis). lol it was alot and was prepared to pay a hefty bill. i sat at the bar the chef was very friendly and just watching him do his magic with the sushi was awesome. i got my salad and soup and edamame and a hot towel thrown at me by the chef, im guessing for cleaning? is this a custom? it was cool though...the shrimp on my rolls was so tender, possibly the best cooked shrimp i have ever tried. the presentation was ethnic as you expect, the service and food were excellent. guess how much my bill was? for 10 rolls, soup, salad, edamame and2 iced teas? 9 dollars. not bad. will be back."}
{"text":"Good time. We sat at the sushi bar and were entertained. We brought my 9 year old very picky daughter and she had fun. She has some edamame and a plate of plain noodles. Sticking me for 5 bucks for a small pile of plain noodles I felt was outrageous. Sushi was good and rolls were fantastic. Asked the sushi chef to make his favorite and it was a spicy tuna roll with a sweet sauce that was awesome. We'll come back, but I'll give me daughter a hot dog before we go."}
{"text":"Mido Sushi is great!  They have an excellent deal for happy hour, which is all day from Monday-Thursday, and from 11:30-5 on Friday and Saturday. Nigiri sushi and rolls are 1/2 price. The happy hour menu for sushi is pretty extensive, and a lot of specialty rolls are included. The rolls themselves are a large portion of fish and vegetable. The quality is pretty good, especially for the price.  We ordered 6 different rolls and left very full. Even the basic rolls such as tuna and salmon have a lot of fish in them and are pretty large, compared to other sushi restaurants where your basic rolls have a tiny amount of fish, and are pretty anemic looking compared to others. We had 2 deep fried rolls with jalapeno, and they were perfectly crispy, with a nice spicy kick to them from the fresh pepper. We also tried a deep-fried chicken roll since it sounded like a pretty unusual roll. It was also delicious, with panko-crusted chicken wrapped in rice and seaweed.  The free salad, edamame, and miso soup is a nice beginning to your meal.   Service was cheerful and friendly. Drinks were refilled promptly as needed.  I'd love to come here to try their $20 all-you-can-eat deal. One of these days I'll head on over to pig out on their tasty sushi!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend, he was late but we were sat right away and served flavorless salad and miso soup. We didn't see a waitress again for 15 minutes and the place was empty.   We decided to go ahead and order, never got a refill on our hot tea until the meal was over and she came to collect our plates. The sushi was OK, not bad but certainly not amazing. It took a while for it to come out, and again, empty dining room.   As the dining room filled up we waited a good 35 minutes after eating to see a check. In fact the two waitresses in the room kept walking right passed us without a glance.  A bit of a drive from central Phoenix so I can't say we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Tonight I went with my family to have dinner. The lady that sat us down was not friendly like she normally is. I  understand they were support busy.  Our sushi came out pretty fast which was great for my kids but my husbands soup never showed up, even letting the young lady there know.  The whole time, I saw the young lady bring out small bowls of soup to the other tables but never once to check on our bowl of soup. Time went by and still nothing.  We told the younger girl to bring us the check and to remove the soup. She must not understand how to cross something off the bill because she came back with nothing change. At the end another older lady took care of our bill and made it right.  I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes.  But the all you can eat sushi was just ok. Some of the fish was weird and I'm pretty sure my last piece has some sort of bone in it. Perhaps the fish wasn't cleaned properly. So I left there not feeling great.  Anyway, it's worth checking out. But don't have super high hopes."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that the very first sushi experience I had was at a little restaurant named Sushi Hama in Tucson years and years ago. I LOVE sushi and the first time I had it I was instantly hooked (they have this specialty roll- the \"Pancho roll\"- named after the owner). They've since opened several locations and are under new management. Whenever I go back to Tucson I make it a point to stop by this place. (P.S. If anyone reading this makes a pit stop in Tucson- check this place out [or at least the Yelp page]).  So, the other day my bf and I had a craving for sushi and wanting to try a new place we stopped in here. As I'm looking through the menu I see a \"Pancho roll\" and a \"Tucson roll\" on the menu. I immediately light up and ask the sushi chef behind the bar if a Pancho works here. Sure enough the former owner of Sushi Hama is now here! I don't know if he owns this place or not but he still makes THE best sushi! The Pancho roll was just as good as I had remembered it being and the experience brought me back to the first time I'd had that roll many moons ago. We ended up getting the all you can eat which comes with the familiar salad w/ sesame oil salad dressing, miso soup and edamame. Every roll we had was delicious and Pancho even made a special extra spicy tuna roll for my bf.  I am so happy to have accidentally stumbled upon this place and I tell you- I will definitely be hitting this place up when I need my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Mido sushi is one of my favorite places. Fish is always good. Salmon yellowtail tuna white tuna  fish eggs. Soft shell crab tempura plate ice cream service cleanliness. Overall everything is great. Highly recommend mido"}
{"text":"Best Sushi ever. Never seen an all you can eat with Hamachi and Ikura. My regular go to Sushi Restaurant."}
{"text":"Still giving this place 4 stars because their sushi is downright amazing, but being a long-standing customer here, I'm still confused about how their all-you-can-eat sushi works.  We stopped by last night, and as an appetizer, we got a small salad and edamame, but no sashimi plate that I had mentioned in my last review.  And we weren't offered ice cream at the end of the meal either.  Also, although it was advertised as $19.99, it's really $21.99.  Not a big deal, but I did scowl slightly at my receipt.  Unlike other days, they were very prompt about getting our second round of sushi, and this, I fully appreciate.  I guess in summary, don't expect anything other than what you order, but if on the off chance you do get a sashimi plate for an appetizer and ice cream for dessert, you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Oh my dear Pancho, how have I missed you! The day you left Tucson is the day sushi was never the same for me. Luckily I have now moved to the Phoenix metro and can frequent you as often as I like. I still think you have delicious sushi, however I was very disappointed last time I visited your restaurant. I was served a very overcooked Las Vegas roll. The worst part is, you handed me this roll personally! I paid for the food a la carte and did not have an all you can eat! This alone should ensure my food is not overcooked, almost burned. The rest of the nigiri and rolls were good, but I know this place can do way better!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and was pleasantly surprised. Due to dietary restrictions I am unable to eat rice, so I always order my sushi without it. Every place is a little different in how they adapt the sushi without rice, so I'm never sure what I'll get, but after the initial confusion, the chef was great. The rolls I ordered were perfect and delicious, exactly what I asked for! Also, happy hour runs from 11:30am-5pm with great options and prices.  Definitely found my new favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here for their awesome all you can eat deal! $24 for unlimited rolls is definitely worth the cost! Tip: ask for the sashimi plate before your rolls come out is it amazing! Ask for a side of gochujang with it too if you like a lil sweet&spicy sauce to dip your sashimi in. SO GOOD. At the end, of you have enough room for it, you get little cold cup of ice cream which is always a nice little treat! I've had both the mango and the green tea flavors, both delicious :)"}
{"text":"The sushi was good. The miso soup was missing tofu and seaweed so it was really just a broth (free of charge) The salad was tasty (free of charge). We did the all you can eat sushi which we liked. The sushi chef behind the counter was very nice. Someone always came to clean played we were finished with. The sign outside says Japanese, but they have the tv going which is in Korean (Note the difference) Great price-- Friendly staff--We will be back again w/ Friends! $$$ well spent"}
{"text":"This place is yummmmmm... I love the half off sushi and the beef udon noodle soup... it's hard to find sushi places that are good and taste fresh. This will be my go to spot for sushi."}
{"text":"For all you can eat sushi this is excellent. Many places give small portions of fish, not here. Good portion and fresh."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family in buckeye.  Food: the sushi was good. I wouldn't recommend the deep fried stuff, too greasy. The sashimi was ok, I've had fresher. The fresh cut rolls were pretty good I recommend the usual popular ones like California, Philadelphia, rainbow roll etc.  Service:when we first got there it was pretty empty. Maybe 3 other couples. We got seated in the corner of the restaurant near the bar so I figured Oo awesome were close to the sushi bar, that means we're getting our food quicker... Not. We ordered the first round and it took about 20 minutes to get it to our table(keep in mind there were only 3 other couples. We did 3 rounds and between each round it was a 20-25 minute wait. It got busier as time went on but the long wait seemed ridiculous.  And that's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"This place great.  Its a simple mom and pop sushi shop that prides on the \"All you can eat sushi\"  Good service and smiles. I will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I live about 30 minutes away without traffic and I love going to this place even though other places are closer. Im just going to bullet point it out  1. $23, all you can eat, good solid sushi and fish, comes with miso, edema-me, sashimi appetizer included and choice of ice cream desert  EDIT: Just found out if you go in solo you do not get the sashimi appetizer. It is only for 2 or more all you can eat guests  2. weekday half price menu from 10am-10pm..comes with miso and edema-me ..example: philly roll which they make with carrots is $3.50 for this time  3. excellent spacious room with sushi bar  4. not just fish..a nice range of non fish products  5. hot towels thrown at you from behind sushi bar  6. 2 people, weekday night, 8 veggie and fish rolls, $30!  In short this is NOT Zen32..it is not Moto, it isnt even SushiQ..BUT it is a very good place with an excellent menu and a fabulous staff. So if you want to try something new and dont have a lot to spend, this is the place."}
{"text":"I don't care what any of you say, this place is the shizzle!  I've been to a LOT of sushi joints in the valley and none of them really have FANTASTIC sushi, merely different price points and presentation, neither of which make these places any more appealing to me.    First off, I tend to favor little hole in the wall joints rather than big fancy pants chains that are trying to be cooler than they really are.  Second, it's the best sushi you can get a a reasonable price.  Third,  if the service is good, that means I WILL be back.  Chance was our server this time, and was so witty and on the ball that it sealed the deal for our return.  We actually discovered Mido by mistake and couldn't have had a more fortunate accident!  My group ordered a number of the, um,  strangely named rolls, some of which were pretty damn delicious, others may not have suited my taste but were interesting nonetheless.  The first experience proved to be comical and appealing for reasons beyond the food;  the Ha Ha (HOT) roll being \"a little warm\" as an understatement, the sudden fear that the place may turn into a karaoke bar later in the night, and the look of pure raging hatred on the face of a hip Japanese teen when his birthday ice cream was brought to him with a candle and a song.   Fortunately no one ended up a burn victim,  nor is Mido a were-karaoke bar and the kid was not successful in his efforts to use his mind powers to induce cranial explosions in both his mother and father.  Since then, we tend to go there at least once a week (or more) and make it a point to go there anytime someone is celebrating a birthday!  Keep in mind that I live in central Phoenix and drive all the way to Chandler to go munch at this joint.  Since Zen32 closed, there isn't anywhere closer that I enjoy nearly as much.  Can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi, either.  Not even crappy sushi buffets can touch the $20 deal, which includes appetizers, dessert and a plate of sashimi that would run $40 anywhere else.  The three sushi chefs are unique on their own.  Pancho heads up the pack with a friendly attitude and good humor.  Definitely makes you feel welcome and can entertain you in a great deal of different languages.    On a final note, If it's your birthday, be sure to opt in for the free ice cream and let them know it's your birthday!"}
{"text":"The happy hour deal was great!! I got 3 vegan rolls for under $8 and miso and edamame were free.   I love sushi but have never gone on my own to a sushi restaurant, the staff was not very helpful despite my obvious confusion about how to go about seating myself and ordering.   If you are unfamiliar with sushi restaurants, perhaps start somewhere else or bring a friend, but the quality of the rolls was great and the price was even better."}
{"text":"If u like real sushi - fresh sashimi-  than this place is not for you. My nigiri and sashimi were not fresh and extremely questionable  quite frankly scary. They could not get my order correct either. I wouldnt feed what they served me to my dog. Serious fail."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever, great value. Been a loyal customer of Pancho's for 15 years. Best rolls are the Pancho and Naked Vegas"}
{"text":"Be ready to wait!!! We got AYCE, took 20mins for them to give us our first orders (and they didn't even give us all our rolls!!) and then on our second order, we waited for 30mins and when I asked how much longer, they said they were still working on it. We only order 3 rolls and a couple sashimi. I cancelled it. Honestly, sushi was decent, service was decent but their sushi chefs are TOO SLOW!!!! After I complained, they were nice enough not to charge me for one person but I left unsatisfied, hungry and regretting spending $72 at this place. I will not be coming back and will not be recommending to anybody."}
{"text":"I've been to Mido twice now trying the All-you-can-eat sushi option as well as the normal a la carte offerings. After trying the AYCE option I think its a decent but pricey option. For $28 including tip you get wave after wave of a wide variety of sushi/nigiri/sashimi options they have as well as hot tea. If you choose this route I recommend the Mido roll and the Dragon rolls as they were ones that stood out from the generic other rolls we tried. Spicy jalapeno yellowtail was disappointing as the yellowtail was a mix of mayo, sriracha, and lackluster fish. The nigiri here was disappointing as well as the ones here are an example of quantity over quality. Do note that you won't be getting some of the better stuff they have when you order from the AYCE model.   A la carte I had a better experience as I chose the soba sushi dinner combo. The spicy tuna donburi and soba that I received for around $18 was massive as well as tasty with each entree coming out in one of those giant bowls they use for Pho or Bibimbap. My dining compatriots got the ramen and sushi/unagi and their bowls were just as big. (Though looking at the online menu I can't seem to find this amazing combo of food)  Sorta funny that some previous reviewers said this place is an all-japanese restaurant..... Place is full Korean owned lol (Which is why you'll see more fusion rolls and not some of the Japanese staples like the negiyama roll)  So yeah decent food that will fill you up and one of the few places in Phoenix that will do AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Happy hour all day and $20 all u can eat .. Can never go wrong with that.. They also give a small salad,miso soup and edamame for free to start off.."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour specials here! They have great pricing and the food is tasty. I'm not ever really impressed with the waitresses though, so I usually sit at the bar, where you're sure to get great service from the gentlemen who make the sushi."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mido since 2009 maybe, and I'm just now remembering to do our long-term relationship justice with a proper review. Whenever I think to grab a hometown bite, Mido immediately comes to mind.  Mido has really been there for my formative foodie years, seeing me grow from an unversed teenage eater with an unhealthy exclusive inclination towards Las Vegas rolls into a sashimi fiend that can pick up a table with a pair of chopsticks. In all seriousness though, Mido was my first introduction into AYCE sushi and is one of the very few places that I can frequent without a smidgen of regret. I haven't had a single bad experience here over the past few years and Pancho always puts out nothing but the best in quality.   If you're doing AYCE, come hungry. Delving in can almost feel like a strategy-based system (\"How am I going to eat all of this? Will I need to go a pant size up after this meal? Do I have an extra hour to spare for the food coma that's sure to come?? Was I sent here by God to eat all of this food?\"), but just grab your faves early on and pace yourself. The Dragon, Orange, and Pancho rolls are pretty standard in my orders and never fail to impress. Pancho's even sent us a boat of just sashimi on occasion which, while indulgent, has really solidified my love for all things sushi.  I'm surprised to be reading up on a few mixed reviews on this place, since I'd be hard pressed to find another place in the valley that offers a dining experience with the same quality in food and service as Mido. Most definitely in my top 5 favorite places in Zona, if not anywhere."}
{"text":"Pancho rocks! Love his new joint. All you can eat is great and as fresh as ever. The fish salad was very yummy. Nothing was wilted, there was great attentive service and we were tucked around the corner out of their view. Pancho has come up with some nice tasty new rolls but we were all disappointed in that he changed his vegas roll. At sushi hama Pancho would make his vegas roll with sesame seed on the outside, now it has the same batter as everyone else. There were still flying towels and crazy disco lights for birthdays. Mido is a great place to go to."}
{"text":"I love this place primarily for their happy hour deals, which are really generous, especially Monday-Thursday. Half price nigiri and rolls pretty much all day (actual price is not reflected on the menu they provide). They also have all you can eat for $20! Sushi is good, not great, but it definitely satisfies the craving for a good price. My biggest complaint is the wine list is very short and boring, really wish they'd add a few extra varieties. My husband and I usually go here of we want to fill up on sushi. We go to Shimogamo if we want really fantastic sushi and feel willing to pay the price for it."}
{"text":"At 24$, I don't recommend getting AYCE unless you can eat a lot. The sushi here is OK. The chefs are Korean so unsurprisingly the sushi looks and tastes more like Kimbab, which might not be a bad thing since this means a greater fish to rice ratio, whereas other places have a lot of rice and no fish.   Service is also OK. The biggest con is they require you to put everyone's order on one sheet of paper. When I asked if we could separate them, the waitress was reluctant and said the orders would come out at different times. So when the food came out it's hard to remember who ordered what. Also our order came out wrong with some nigiri missing. After reordering, it still didn't come out after waiting a long time so we canceled our order after being told it was still thawing. Overall I would probably come here once in a while since they have a good amount of fish."}
{"text":"I can do cheap sushi, and I get concept that I get what I paid for but the yelpers were wrong about this place.   First and foremost, everyone talks about the happy hour, the happy hour is the entire time they are open. So its really not a happy hour, just discounted items 24/7. In addition, the happy hour menu, isn't that great, I came to eat rolls because my bf was craving just sushi rolls, but every roll I saw had cream cheese. Cream cheese is in my opinion a cop out, it gives the sushi a creamier taste without using more \"expensive\" avocados and it is awful because it completely covers up all other flavors in the roll. Many of the rolls were deep fried as well. We ordered a couple of rolls and some nigiri, the fish didn't taste fresh and many of them had a weird aftertaste to them.  I like americanized sushi and rolls, but I like them to be done well and this place didn't execute it well at all. In addition, we got the tempura and the shrimp had no flavor. It just tasted like breading...   I wouldn't recommend this place at all, I think chain sushi places make better rolls than Mido."}
{"text":"I've had a nasty bug and have been eating lots of soup.  I decided to check with Yelp and see if there are any Japanese places close to the office so that I could have some miso soup for lunch.  This idea led to the following:  \"Mido Sushi!\"  \"Yes, do you have Miso soup?\"  \"Hello?\"  \"Do you have miso soup?\"  \"Mido Sushi!\"  \"DO YOU HAVE MISO SOUP?\"  \"Soup?  Miso?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Hello?\"  \"YES!\"  \"Mido Sushi!\"  \"MISO SOUP!\"  \"You come get!\"  \"Ok.  Hello?\"  \"Click.\"  *from the next office*   \"You're having miso soup for lunch?  Sounds good.\"  So the miso soup was inexpensive. I got basically a quart for about $1.75. The broth itself was pretty good but it had minimal tofu and no scallions or other garnish.  Average miso at best but when you have the flu it works well."}
{"text":"This sushi place was pretty good. The all you can eat is definitely worth it. Service was polite and friendly. We ordered several different rolls, however some of them tasted the same.. I love myself some sushi as much as the next girl. The place was super clean, which was a giant plus. I cannot do dirty when it comes to sushi or similar sit downs. I would definitely go here again with my girls."}
{"text":"The sushi was good! The atmosphere is nothing exciting, but I will definitely be back for the all you can eat menu!"}
{"text":"I used to work at a popular sushi joint, which was awesome but kind of pricey considering what you were getting. We found this place and haven't been back! It's freaking delicious and the staff is SO nice. My (straight-up white) boyfriend is now eating sashimi and nigiri like it's his business! The all-you-can-eat is great and comes with your choice of tempura or gyoza appetizer and sashimi for 2. SO GOOD, the white toro and salmon are our faves! It's always fresh and cold, never warm sushi! It's not one of those uber-trendy places, which is great from our point of view (we hate Snobbsdale). It's GREAT quality and the amount of fish you receive is definitely a generous amount! If you're not into all-you-can-eat, they have a really generous happy hour that extends until night time, not just for lunchers. Oh, did I mention $6 sake bombers all the time? Holla! lol"}
{"text":"Sashimi was pretty decent, especially the white tuna.  California rolls were good as expected.  Chicken terriyaki was just ok.  All in all, food was good.  Biggest problem was the service as it felt like a total chore to get the waitress to take our order.... even after we were seated before several other tables who already had their order taken and appetizers/drinks brought to their table."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time and I was very happy with the results.  The food was really good and the wait staff was very attentive.  I will absolutely go there again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mido for years... Maybe almost 10 years?? Have they been around that long?? Yikes... Okay, Definitely at least like 7?  I think... lol... It is a good deal for All You Can Eat.  The price was raised from $20 to 22 now, but sashimi, gyoza, tempura, edamame, sushi, and ice cream are included.  Is it the highest quality sushi in town?  No.  But is it pretty good/decent?  Yes.  They have a decent happy hour if you aren't interested in eating more than $20 worth of sushi.  They also have a full menu if you or people in your group do not want sushi.    They do put carrots in a few sushi rolls, which I found to be odd, but I just ask them not to put carrots on anything and is cool.    If you go during a busy time or a large group, service can be slow.  But I usually go for an early dinner, so it works out for me."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you're looking for a casual, affordable, fast & YUMMY go-to sushi place. All you can eat is an awesome deal if you really can eat a ton, but we usually take advantage of the awesome Happy Hour!   I'm more of a nigiri and sashimi fan, but they also have a huge selection of all the cooked and fancier rolls. All the rolls are a pretty good size, and I love that they don't overdo the rice. You also get a good amount of fish on each nigiri, which is nice to see.  The atmosphere is super casual and full of big tables for groups. My boyfriend and I also love that this place is actually lit well! We're not fans of dark, \"mood\" lighting in restaurants.  This place is also awesome for families and groups with people who are unsure about the whole raw fish thing. They have tons of cooked roll options that would be great for those picky eaters!  All in all, this place is a SOLID go-to if you're looking for a casual sushi place with quality food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big sushi fans, and have tried many valley locations. Some good, some bad, very few great. Mido falls in that category. fresh sushi and sashimi, generous portions (the $19.95 All You Can Eat is a CRAZY good value), clean, friendly...just a great combo.  Pancho, the main man, is a treat all by himself. I would recommend that you sit at the sushi bar, but I don't want you taking up my seat!!!  For the whole package of quality, quantity, atmosphere and price,, you can't beat Mido."}
{"text":"My friend and I by chance found this restaurant.  The food was great!  The service was great!  I will now be a regular."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley for the price. I've been eating here for 8 years now. Will always recommend this place to friends. Mido Sushi AAA+"}
{"text":"Not really sure how people are leaving bad reviews for this place. Maybe it was just bad luck. We went tonight, a Saturday, and it was packed, the service was excellent and quick, and the all you can eat sushi was wonderful. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"$20 unlimited sushi is a steal and if you order enough, you get it served in a boat! Mido soup, edamame and a salad is included as well. The staff is super friendly and they have tv to watch sports."}
{"text":"I eat at sushi restraints all over the nation.  My wife and I try a different place almost every time we go out.   This is by far the worst place we have been.   The service was great but the food is the worst. I swear that they use kipper snacks in some of the rolls.   On a brighter note they have good green tea."}
{"text":"I love going to Performance Bike to visit Sam, who always seems to be able to find me great deals.  Well today after completing my purchases, I left the store, and noticed this Japanese music playing over the outdoor sound system.  Sam had reminded me of a sushi restaurant a few doors down, and I decided to give it a shot (since I need a few more reviews before achieving # 100).  I plopped down at the sushi bar, and scribbled a mark next to 'spicy tuna roll' and 'asparagus roll'.  I was immediately handed a salad topped with crunchy tempura batter.  Noticing some kind of potential shellfish in the salad, I inquired as to the identity of the mystery ingredient.  The sushi chef replied that it was red snapper.  Having been given the 'green light' to consume the dish, my taste buds exploded with flavor.  The dressing was creamy and spicy, a pleasant surprise.  I was also brought a smaller 2nd salad (which contained imitation crab meat), a bowl of miso soup, and a small offering of cold edamame.  The sushi was just OK, but the abundance of free appetizers made this sushi order seem more like a bento box."}
{"text":"Love this place, can't believe I haven't written them a review before! My family always chooses Mido for any family gathering. For sushi they are one of the best! They never overly pack in the rice like other competitors and the portions of raw fish is always more than generous. The owners daughters are always so nice when they greet customers and I love family owned mom and pops restaurants. Great blend of neighborhood feel with the right amount of professionalism! Love it!"}
{"text":"Good food  Good service  Great value! My daughter and I enjoy coming here and we always end up ordering a bunch of rolls and sharing everything."}
{"text":"You have options at this place. Ayce, happy hour (since it basically runs all day m-th and til 5 on Friday and Saturday), or regular menu. We opted for ayce which we thought would be a good deal, but the menu was somewhat limited. Kids under 12 were their age plus $2 so come prepared for that. Adults were $24. I got sick after our first round... not sure what I ate, but my stomach started hurting pretty quickly. Besides that, the food was mediocre at best. Even the miso soup didn't have any seaweed or tofu. The best roll I had was the pancho but I didn't eat my $24 worth for sure. Staff was nice and bathrooms were decent (I know cuz I had to frequent several times). And the place needs some energy! Turn on some music or something. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is one of our favorite places to eat sushi.  Nothin matters when you can eat delicious sushi for that price. 23$ For the quality and size of sushi is nothing.  Always fresh and good. And believe me I'm one picky eater!"}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews for this place, and decided to try it.  Since I'm not from the area, I heavily rely on word-of-mouth and Yelp for all of my reviews.  The reviews for this place seemed promising, but I expected better than what I received.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but there is better sushi than here.  Granted, this place is cheaper, so if you want to go for inexpensive sushi with really great happy-hour specials, then this place is for you....considering their happy hour ends at closing."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. After reading the yelp reviews and seeing the pictures, I was looking forward to the all you can eat sashimi. When I had asked about it, the waitress told me no, sashimi was not included in the all you can eat. My friend and I ended up ordering some rolls off the regular menu and nothing was impressive. Service was great at first. But once we got our food, they basically forgot about us. Never got a refill on our drinks until we got the bill. I kept making eye contact with all of them but they just looked the other way. It took at least 30 mins to get the check.  Price wise, it was reasonable. But like I said. Nothing special. I came specifically for the AYCE Sashimi but was told it didn't exist. So probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love coming here every time I'm in east valley!   I always get the Korean style sashimi with only salmon and tuna, and shrimp tempura with mixed veggies"}
{"text":"I have often not given the south valley its dues for its cuisine. This place is in my old stomping grounds and has broken that stubborn behavior that this is just the burbs.  Now to explain why not the full fantastic five stars. If I could have given them an extra half star I would. I would have wanted to see more nigiri  or sashimi than California Rolls. It did taste pretty amazing, something I don't often want to admit about California Rolls. Kinda like being in the closet about liking science fiction movies or video games.  Now I know I ordered Boat, it's a cheesy move, but it's Boat..!!!....BOAT.!!..it comes on a Boat. Oh, and yes I consumed it all on my own with pride of a conquering overlord. This was entry level Boat it's level Boat 1, hopefully in the coming weeks I'll defeat the game bosses and level up to Boat 4 while playing hidden levels of miso soup and teriyaki chicken.  There's always gonna be the folks that say \"I don't eat sushi here in the valley, it's just not fresh.\" Exactly and if it was even in a coastal city, you would be paying a small fortune. Well it has been said by Sushi Master Yasuda that there's no flavor in fresh fish.  I'm fortunate where I work it's convenient to deviate here for a delicious meal after the grind is finished."}
{"text":"Mido is Perfecto! I honestly love this place and i am a complete sushi snob. The all you can eat is the absolute best deal and their \"spicy\" rolls ARE ACTUALLY SPICY, DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE THAT IS?? We found this place on a whim and came back 4 times in 2 weeks. Im seriously addicted, was almost considering not writing this so i could keep this gem to myself"}
{"text":"$64 and change. That is how much all the sushi I enjoyed here would cost.... IF I had not done the all you can eat. $22 and a very large menu including several types of nigiri. There is no limit to how much nigiri you get with the exception being one order of eel per person. Also you must eat the rice, not just the fish, and you also get either tempura or gyoza included. When you arrive you get a small salad, a miso soup and some edamane. Have been here 4 or 5 times now and have always gotten good service, quality sushi, and left full and happy. Here is what I got my most recent trip  Round1: Salmon, tuna, white toro, masago, eel, and a Vegas roll.   Round 2: Yellowtail, snapper, and albacore as well as a CA top Rainbow roll, and a haha roll.   The rolls were okay but honestly the star of the show is the nigiri. White toro is my favorite. Will I be back? Of course I will!"}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes to be helped. We seated ourselves after standing in the front and not being acknowledged. Once seated we told several employees we needed menus and they would walk right by us and not pay attention. Worse service. Sushi was okay. Not one person seemed please to help us. I will never be back here"}
{"text":"Love the towel throwing... love the lunch special... love the fish salad and green tea ice cream (which they give for FREE)... love the all-you-can-eat-sushi option even more!  Food is great, sushi is fresh, and service is good.  Been here so many times both lunch and dinner and was never disappointed.  Went for a friend's birthday dinner... they dimmed the lights, turn on the disco lights and played a (very different) birthday song while the server had confettis and poppers for the celebrant.  Very funny!  :)"}
{"text":"HUGE fan!  Love Poncho, the birthday strobe lights, the food and the service.   This is a go-to for my boyfriend and I when we're looking for sushi. More likely than not, we'll opt for the all you can eat option for $20/ person.   With that comes with miso soup, salad, sashimi, your AYCE picks, ice cream and with a special frequent customer request, this awesome pan seared, naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks, which are AMAZING. Not a taste for everyone, kinda bizarre for most. But this will be well appreciated by traditional Asian taste and PERFECT for me. Loyalist here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. You cant beat $20 all u can eat sashimi, nigiri, and sushi. The fish is fresh and always delicious. Service is great, we stayed 30 min past their closing time, and i didnt feel like i am unwelcome anymore. Sake bombers and sashimi equals good times!"}
{"text":"This place has all you can eat everyday!  The prices were lower and have increased a little bit since we started coming here but I do still think it's worth it for sushi! I liked that it is in a nice area as well.  I come here for sushi when I get that craving and don't plan on stopping anytime soon!  It's worth a try if you're in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"How could anyone write a bad review about this place? I've been coming here for at least 5 years and have never had a bad experience. The sushi is delicious and staff is very friendly including the sushi chefs. How could anyone complain about happy hour half-off sushi and $23 all you can eat sushi? I take my friends here all they time and they LOVE it. I'm just one of the many returning customers here!! I highly recommend this place for sushi."}
{"text":"Good sushi and really good happy hour prices with 6 dollar Sake bombs! We especially liked how friendly the staff was. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has worked hard and have a great service now with excellent hosts.  Food is a great value."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place! Not really familiar with places out on this part of town but Mido does not disappoint!! Met my friends here for happy hour sushi before our Tango lesson. Ordered sashimi and nigiri pieces(my favorites!) All orders come with miso soup+ ginger salad as well! My salmis,tuna and halibut was impeccable, fresh and delicious! Love trying new places out, thank you Mido!!"}
{"text":"Better quality than other sushi restaurants that do \"all you can eat\" that I have tried. Service was prompt. I'll definitely go back. I was kind of disappointed that we didn't get the green tea ice cream others have mentioned."}
{"text":"Mido Sushi is an excellent experience!  The sushi and sashimi are fresh.  The selection is broad.  The price is reasonable.  Good Happy Hour (5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.).  On a Thursday evening, they were fairly busy and it's easy to understand why.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The wife and I are very picky when it come too sushi. The eel, tuna, and salmon must melt in your mouth!!! And they did. The sushi chefs are funny ( I hope they weren't laughing at me because I got something hot and it was) and the knife skills WOW!! Small place very clean and the service was good. PS the all you can eat menu has it all."}
{"text":"Ask for Sharon and nobody else! She makes this place.  Everyone else in this place is rude and grumpy, especially the older lady with shorter hair.  Service sucks normally, but Sharon is amazing! She smiles, doesn't accuse us of sharing and doesn't act like we just asked her to Stab her eye when asked for water.  She's generous with the ponzu sauce too. I'd give this place 1 star if it weren't for Sharon.  Ps. The rolls are bomb.  Well, except for the Mexican roll."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I have to give this place 2-stars, but so be it. The food was actually not bad. I like that they automatically bring out salad, miso and edamame, although the edamame was cold and unsalted. The Sprite was good too, nice and refreshing. That's where my good comments end.   I found this place on Restaurants.com, and after checking out reviews on Yelp, I bought a $25 gift certificate for $2. But of course, you can't use the GC with their all you can eat option or with their happy hour prices. Since their happy hour goes until 10pm, and all the sushi is half price at happy hour, there's really no need for the GC. I probably spent the same amount I would have spent during happy hour anyway.   So my daughter and I go in and sit down. They don't seat you personally, they just tell you to choose a table. A couple walks in and sits down after us. We wait awhile for someone to come over and at least give us menus. Nope. I guess I was looking for too much. However, they did go over and greet the couple that came in and sat down after us -- brought them menus and drinks and everything! So someone finally comes over with our salad, miso and edamame, and then takes our drink order and gives us menus.   The food comes, and like I said, the food was actually pretty decent, which makes this 2 star rating so unfortunate. While I'm eating my sushi, my throat becomes parched because I've run out of Sprite, and no one has come over to offer to get me more. I start trying to get their attention, yet no one will even look our way. About 10 minutes later, one of the waitresses walked by -- not to check on us, just to be clear -- and we were able to grab her attention to get me another Sprite.   I would not go out of my way to go here again. However, if I happen to be in the area, am in the mood for sushi, want a good Sprite, and am mentally prepared to deal with the foolishness they call service, then I may try this place again."}
{"text":"Oh Mido, you're too fun. They have some of the best prices in the Valley and still haven't let go of the All-You-Can-Eat Deal! The guys behind the bar are super fun, talk them up, tip them and you'll see the enthusiasm they have for what they do.  Their fish is fresh, and the servers are quick/on their game. I've never had a bad time or meal here. It's more laid back than other places and if it's your birthday they'll bust out the overhead disco ball for a brief moment to congratulate you on staying alive for another year.  Woo! Check em out if you want a relaxed, well price sushi meal on the East Side."}
{"text":"Great sushi place tucked away in a strip center on se corner of Kyrene and Ray Rd. The traditional chefs make some of the best Avacado rolls ( they call it a Ray roll ) I have ever tasted.  The salmon sashimi is superfresh and very well prepared .  They have happy hour for sushi in weekdays and the place was full of all age groups and  backgrounds and they were all enjoying the good food. Be sure to tip your chef!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mido Sushi several times and always had the best of experiences.  Their happy hour is very affordable albeit a bit of a drag that only the Saki is 1/2 off and not any beer.  Nonetheless, the food has always been tasty and an extra treat with the small salad and edamame appetizers that come to each table.  Chance the server is also excellent and a pleasure.    What has drug the star count down from 5 to 3 is my last visit for a Saturday happy hour ended up with me 3 hours later puking on Chandler Blvd at a stop light.  No doubt it was food poisoning that lasted a few hours.  I'm not a big fan of vomiting especially from bad food.    I realize that you take certain risks when eating sushi but in a nutshell............ bad fish just CAN'T HAPPEN!    To reiterate, I've eaten at this establishment many times with no ill affects and loved it but...........eater beware."}
{"text":"Most sushi places end up with a bill with around $15-30/person depending on how much you order or where you go.  Unless you are going to be planning on eating a second dinner or drinking a lot, usually you need more food afterwards to settle your stomach.  Mido sushi has all you can eat $20 sushi.  I have been to places like this, such as Todai.  The significant difference between Mido and Todai is that they ask you what you want to order and it is freshly made.  The all you can eat also comes with a soup, salad, tempura, edamame, hot tea, and ice cream (get the mango, has a few chunks of real mango).  I didn't waste too much space other than the sushi, and that is what I recommend if you want to get a bang for your buck.  I think between the 4 of us, we ordered around 25 rolls of sushi.  As much as the sushi was excellent, the service is a hit or miss depending on the mood of the servers.  I think last night was a good night, but I have heard they can be crabs.  I also heard they actually ask you why you don't tip at least 15%.  In my opinion, even though tip is very standardized, I still feel you have to earn your tip.  My standard is 20% for far exceeding service, 15% for great service, and 12% for average service, 10% or sometimes less for poor service.  When we entered, they had a disco ball and some music playing for someone's birthday.  They should have had the \"Celebration\" theme song after the amount of sushi we chowed down!"}
{"text":"Used to eat at Pancho's sushi place in Tucson, years ago. Thought we would give his Chandler location a try. I ordered ayce, wife had tempura shrimp roll and tempura appetizer.  Wife enjoyed very much, especially crispy crunchy tempura shrimp. I had a couple of rolls, soft shell crab pretty good.  Only thing I did not enjoy was the salmon sushi. Bright orange, sticky texture and fishy tasting. Service was excellent, hot tea always refilled, very attentive. Good value, acceptable quality, look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Aside from the service, which was great, I have to say that I was really not impressed with Mido Sushi.   If I had to give this place a ranking on the list of all the sushi establishments I've visited it would definitely fall towards the bottom of my list for taste and quality.  It started off with edamame (and not very good edamame at that), miso soup (lukewarm at best) and a small salad (consisted of lettuce, sesame dressing and a piece of imitation crab).  I had hoped the sub par openers wouldn't be a sign of things to come, but unfortunately that turned out not to be the case.    I was attracted to the idea of Mido Sushi after seeing that they have an all-you-can-eat sushi option for $19.99, and many of the reviews on here stating that quality did not suffer as a result of endless rolls.  Now that I've been here, I will say that the all-you-can-eat sushi option would be great if you were looking for quantity rather than quality.  However, if you could be satisfied with just two or three rolls I would say there are better options out there that wouldn't cost anymore than Mido's all-you-can-eat option.  Since my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach, and I prefer higher quality sushi than I had here, I'll probably find a better option in the area next time."}
{"text":"Years later and this is still my favorite sushi place. The hubby and I just had another fantastic dinner here last night and so I thought it was time to write an update.   My favorite fried rolls are the Las Vegas which has a ton of flavor and comes with a yummy sweet sauce drizzled on top and the calamari roll which actually is not fried but the squid inside is. This one tastes really great if you add a little dollop of sirracha hot sauce to it. I usually try to limit us to either one or the other so that we don't get too much fried in one meal so last night we went with the calamari and also our other usual maki. The one with the three different kinds of fish (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail) is delicious. You get so much fish and it is always such good quality and so fresh tasting! I also love the Tucson roll and last night we added cream cheese to it just to make things a little more interesting. It was perfect! I am a huge shrimp fanatic so this one is just really tasty. I also like to order the cucumber roll. My husband does not eat cucumber so I have to consume the entire roll myself but it is just so fresh and light that this is not a problem. I love the crunch of the cucumber... and it goes so well with wasabi and ginger flavors! Just delicious.   To top it all off, they still include salad, miso soup and edamame with every meal. All this food plus two ice teas (mine was green tea and soooo good) and the bill for the two of us came to about $15. All the rolls were from the half price happy hour menu, which they have now extended to 10pm on Mon-Thurs. Just amazing prices! The place is so casual and comfortable that is has become my favorite place to go when I get home from work too tired to cook. And the staff is so friendly! They really know how to treat their regulars well.   Next time you are in the area and in the mood for sushi, skip all the gimmicky chains or glitzy, expensive sushi bars and come here for some down-home good food and great service."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite sushi places. My friends and I love to do the all you can eat deal. It's the cheapest all you can eat place that I know of and the sushi is great quality. They also have awesome mango and green tea ice cream. The only problem I have experienced is when I go for all you can eat with a bunch of my big-eater guy friends, when we're deep into our 3rd rounds (of all you can eat) and on.. they tend to slow down or forget about some rolls you've ordered.  Overall, the experience is well worth it. Especially if you get to hear the birthday song."}
{"text":"Don't let the four stars fool you.   This restaurant is just wrong. I went to this place today during my 7 hours trip from California to Arizona.  First of all this is owned by Korean. There is no one in this restaurant speaks a single Japanese word. But that's not the problem. When it comes to costumer service and food, you literally want to stab yourself with the chopsticks. The waitress rushed us to take order, and she came three times in less than 15 minutes.   After ordering the food, they just drop the plate on the table. Since the soups and salad was free, I won't complain about it, but I have to say they taste horrible. The sushi was so poorly made that they even forgot the most essential ingredient: the rice vinegar.  Yes the sushi was half off, but I didn't expect the quality of the sushi half off. Of all the sushi place I went to, this restaurant is the only one has no idea they are doing the sushi wrong.  Then here comes the big play of Mido sushi's costumer torturing game. I have never had such a boring Tepan chicken. There is no caramelization on 360 degree views of the chicken breast cubes. Yes, chicken freaking breast cubes! The most boring part of chicken ever. And they cost me $16 just for that huge chunk of tasteless bird. I beg you please change the name if the food you are cooking is not the dish on the menu.  Thank you for worsening my already 7 hours tiring trip."}
{"text":"I'm going to update my review for Mido because, well, they deserve an extra star.  I took my neighbors to dinner here last Friday night as a thank you for watching my dog while I was in Las Vegas for a week.   The service was excellent.  We never waited for a refill.  We were brought the check as soon as we needed it.  And, the server put up with a lot of interesting conversation whenever he happened upon it (and laughed with us).  The value was phenomenal.  Where else can four adults and two children start with miso soup and crab salad, eat a gorgeous platter of sashimi, a tempura appetizer, sushi until they are filled and a scoop of ice cream PLUS have sodas and wine for $121 pre tip?  My only suggestion to AYCE newbies is to order the more expensive rolls first.  We just put all our rolls on the first sheet and we got the cheaper rolls like California roll and spicy tuna out first.  Then after a good amount of time, they brought the smaller, more expensive Pancho topped with spicy tuna and the soft shell crab rolls.  It is not a big deal if you have an unlimited appetite, but you might as well get the more pricey rolls with AYCE."}
{"text":"Location: it is located in a huge plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant is relatively clean and organized. You can either seat on tables or the sushi bar.   Service: Their service is pretty good. We ordered all you can eat sushi. Waitress checked on our order at least 5 times to see if we wanted to order more or not. When you need some things - such as refill for tea or extra napkins, they will not avoid eye contact and get you what you need asap.   Food: for approx $23 per person, you can eat different variety of sushi. The meal includes edamame, miso soup and small salad followed by as many rolls as you can handled. We stuff our face until we couldn't eat anymore. The Unagi sushi was absolutely delicious and is the must ordered item. The tuna hand roll wasn't my favorite but I am glad that I've tried it. The rest of the rolls are fairly decent.   Rating: overall, I think the quality of sushi are pretty good for $23. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Not much to say about Mido Sushi beside it seems like coming from the 70s with a disco ball and lights that you'll see in action if it happens to be your birthday!  The food is ok, nothing fancy here and you can feel some flavors here and there depending of the roll you're getting. They have happy hour during lunch and later too which is a nice option if you don't want to go with the All You Can Eat.  You'll get a miso soup and a tea ice cream as dessert which is a nice touch.  When it gets packed, it can be hard to get a good service however if you are at the sushi bar you'll get things quicker.  All in all it is a place to try at least once if you feel a bit nostalgic from the 70s."}
{"text":"yuck. had to send a piece of sushi back because of a bug and should've known then to stop eating. tummy didn't feel so good the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Horrible place.  Asian lady yelling at manager and manager is letting her scream and cuss. Sushi sucks"}
{"text":"I LOVE MIDO SUSHI!!!! Absolutely love their happy hour deals. All the fish here is fresh & if you sit at the sushi bar, you get to watch them prepare your rolls/food items. I love sitting at the sushi bar. The sushi chefs are so nice!! Their happy smiles & can do attitude is what keeps me coming back. They are very pleasant to talk too. They offer an all you can eat sushi option for $20!! Its a great deal! Their drink specials are also great. Nice to have a cold beer while you eat sushi!"}
