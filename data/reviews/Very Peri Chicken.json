{"text":"Yeah so I'm no yelp elite.. I review one or two places a year for good reason; I really don't have the time or interest-- Unless i eat something freaking delicious or freaking disappointing. 

Very Peri (Chick-fiesta) is freaking delicious. Had it for lunch, brought my wife and kids that same night for dinner. 

Get the chicken (Peri or lemon, all good), and get the Peri rice. Go and you will not regret."}
{"text":"First time trying the food today and it was GREAT! I bought whole chicken and a large piri rice on the side. The owner was super nice and friendly. The chicken was marinated and cooked to perfection  I'm hooked"}
{"text":"Fries! Fries! Fries!
Omg the peri fries were to die for. So crunchy but still juicy. Got a large for the 2 of us, and it still wasn't enough. They have a takeout special for 1 whole chicken with one large side for $19.99. We got a large size of peri rice as well, which was ok. The chicken was perfectly grilled (tender and well seasoned), which was cut into 8 pieces - enough for 3 ppl or 2 very hungry ppl. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Good good chicken coleslaw was really delicious
Very clean and good portions would recommend for chicken"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! Don't let the empty restaurant fool you. Like myself, a lot of people order takeout from this place hence the empty seatings. 

What I usually order and like: 
-The chicken is moist and tender, and the sauce is very good. 
-The cajun fries are crispy and good cajun spice. 
-The rice is also good. 


I definitely recommend this place. 

Fore reference, this place is much better than Nandos. Just come here for tastier and cheaper chicken!"}
{"text":"Another small gem in Scarborough. Don't let the plaza's appearance turn you off, the food is well worth it. My recommendation is to get anything BBQ chicken."}
{"text":"Very piri chicken has some bomb food. I'm a big fan of peri peri sauce and I think theirs is one of the best I've had. Place doesn't look like much on the inside but the food is on point. Went with a friend and ordered the beef ribs and coleslaw. The ribs were sauced up with their peri peri sauce and was extremely flavorful. The place is quite small but can seat a few groups. Looks like more of a takeout spot. Will be ordering from here very soon."}
{"text":"Changed its name to chick fiesta. Different supplier. Halal. Good juicy chicken. Decent quantities for the price. Somewhat smallish interior but decent seating arrangement. Have barbican and ice cream and mango milkshake as well."}
{"text":"Chick Fiesta aka Sauce Boss- Peri Peri Flame grilled chicken up close to my work. So thrilled!!

The price was actually very affordable and they have some really great walk in specials. 

Now when people think of peri peri chicken, we always compare it to Nando's. So lets get it out of the way with the comparison. I got the 3 piece dark meat for $5.99. I was full and the sauce on the chicken was delicious and it was \"flame\" grilled as advertised. However, I did seem to notice the chicken is not of the same quality in texture. A little more chewy- not fall of the bone. However for the price and also the sauce. I will definitely be back. 

Interestingly enough- they have a slew of other items on their menu. Burgers- salads- fried chicken- even mango shakes and assortment of drinks.

I took my food to take out and my co-workers raved about the smell. They are enthused to try it- and so should you!!"}
{"text":"Move aside Nando's. We have a new champion for Peri Chicken. 

Nando's is overpriced. I like to pay for the food, not for fancy packaging. Here, you can get a nice half chicken meal for just $13 + tax. Comes with generous portions of sides. Well worth it for the quality. 

I find the chicken here more tasty, and juicy than Nando's. The meat is also very tender, not rubbery like some chicken places. The sauce they use is awesome. I had mild. May try something stronger next time. They have various other options like kebobs or steak which I will definitely have to come back to try."}
{"text":"Love this place..  so good and it's so cheap!!!  Definitely a good place to go that's healthy!"}
{"text":"4 stars

I would definitely come back here.  We ordered 2 ordered of Chicken Leg Quarter with Rice.  One with lemon sauce and one with mild sauce.  We also ordered the mango milkshake.  The price is very affordable.  The lemon sauce is much better as it adds a freshness to the meal.

The Chicken was a bit charred but we usually don't like any charred bits.  The mango milkshake was not too sweet (perfect) and costs a bit more than $3.  Much better deal and quality than the mango slushy we got at chaitime (see chaitime review for reference).

My other complain is that the tables weren't clean so we had to clean them ourselves.

Overall, the food was good and the price was affordable.  I wish there were more places like these."}
{"text":"this place is a very no frills fast casual type restaurant. the food quality with thr price is pretty decent. and the peri peri chicken was decent. i like the fact that the combo choices had a lot of variety and the pricing was fair. there are quite a few sides to choose from. the only thibg is i would say is their weakness is the peri peri fries which honestly tasted like regular fries. the peri spices was not very apparent for the peri peri fries. i would recommend thosr who come here to get sone platters and different sauces to do a share plate and share with a larger group of friends. it is definitely a great sharing experience."}
{"text":"I have visited Chick Fiesta's location by Markham Road and Lawrence last week (and LOVED IT) and was pleasantly surprised that another Chick Fiesta just opened much closer to home, so trying this place out is a no-brainer. 

I am writing this review right now and happy to do it, as I know I am the first review and I encourage my fellow Yelpers to try this place out.

Came in at 6PM for dinner, and the place was empty. It is a Wednesday so I decided to check out their daily special which is a chicken burger for $4.99. My BF got the quarter chicken breast and 1 side for $9.49. 

Good food and quality for what you pay. Food, as expected from Chick Fiesta, is fresh and delicious! I noticed that their Lemon Peri sauce in this location is a bit spicier than their other location. I got the chicken burger with only mayo and they put so much mayo on the burger just the way I like it :)

Somehow this location has the grilled corn available as a side. The other location at Markham road didn't have it.

And also there is a limited number of parking spots in the plaza.

After the meal, the server offered us a free vanilla ice cream too, which was a nice gesture!

Over-all I recommend this place. Their food is just so delicious! Definitely coming back!..



Review 20 of 100"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come for a while, but I'm forgetful and somehow, this place slipped off my bookmarked list of places to go. Oh well. Now I can say I've been here and had their chicken.

This is very much a hole in the wall. It's in the corner of a slightly sketchy little strip plaza. Very little parking in the front, but there is parking in the back, for those of you who are brave enough. The restaurant itself does have a few tables, but I'm guessing this is mostly a takeout place. The tables look clean, but upon closer inspection, they're a tad sticky (dried sauce stains and whatnot). Order at the counter, and then either pick up your food at the counter, or the man at the counter will bring it to you. 

For what I believe is predominantly a takeout place, the service here is quite slow. It looked like there was one man manning both the orders and the kitchen. In other words, if he was making someone's food, there was no one taking orders. Ringing the bell on the counter did not speed this process up at all. Service was polite, but the man at the counter was super quiet. I don't have terrible hearing, but I had to ask him to repeat himself several times because he was speaking so quietly.

Shared the 4 piece flame grilled chicken with side ($9.99), and the two kebabs with a side and salad ($11.99) with my parents. It was just about enough food for the three of us. Oh. We also got a mango milkshake ($2.89 right now. Special price). We got onion rings as side 1 and peri new potatoes as side 2. The salad was served with a very sour dressing. The onion rings are battered, not breaded, which I like. The portion was pretty good. The peri new potatoes didn't taste at all like peri, whatever that meant. They just tasted like potato.The chicken pieces are not large pieces, but I've also seen smaller. They were a tad charred, but still tasty. The chicken we got with the lemon and herb sauce. It was tart, and I couldn't really taste many herbs past the char on the chicken. The kebabs were small for the a la carte price of $3.99, but they were tender. These were ground beef kebabs, and not pieces of beef. We got that one with the mild peri peri sauce, and it was tangy and tart and mildly sightly. Most of the food we ordered either tasted charred/grilled, or tangy and tart and spicy. While tasty, I like a variety of flavors when I eat, and this didn't deliver that. Oh. The mango milkshake tasted like ice cream and mango powder. They say they use real mangoes, but it still tasted like mango powder.

I might be back for the chicken, but given this experience, I'll probably look for another place that does it a little better.

One last thing. 3 pieces of chicken, a la carte, is $3.99. All sides save for peri fries and peri new potatoes are $2.99, and the two mentioned are $3.49. 3 pieces of chicken with a regular side costs $6.99. If my math works, this means you're not actually saving any money ordering the $6.99 set meal unless you order the peri fries or peri new potatoes with your meal. This only applies for the 3 piece set though. For the other chicken with side sets, the set only costs an extra $2."}
{"text":"Well first of all I come from south America and I can tell you I been eating
grill chicken my whole life and this definitely hits the spot with it, it brought me back
straight to my childhood, the meat is tender and juicy and has this smoky flavor in it and
of course their sauces is one of a kind and the best part of all this is the WHOLE CHICKEN is only for $20 and it comes with a large a side. This place definitely worth the travel just for this amazing chicken ^^."}
{"text":"The peri chicken with lemon is fantastic.  You can taste the smoke."}
{"text":"SUPER GOOD!! juicier and saucier than Nandos...will definitely be eating from here again!"}
{"text":"I first found out about Peri Peri chicken when I was living in London, England and experienced Nando's for the first time. 

Since then I've been on the hunt for these little hole in the wall type restaurants serving up fresh BBQ' chicken. 

This place is quaint, no frills style restaurant. The lady working there was extremely nice and friendly. 

Ordered the half chicken platter that comes with a garden salad and your choice of side. We opted for the Peri Peri fries. This simply means that there is a Peri Peri spice that is sprinkled on the fries. 

The food took about 10 minutes which was fair in my opinion. 

It consisted of a large portion of chicken chopped into into manageable portions. Fries were also plentiful and the salad was a great size as well. 

The chicken was nicely charred in all the right places and had an authentic BBQ flavour. The chicken was not doused in Peri Peri sauce but was adequately sauced up. 

The fries were perfectly crispy and served fresh. The salad was delicious although we skipped the dressing for some reason or another. 

We also had a mango milk shake (which is on sale) and it was really really delicious. Perfect texture and the flavour was spot on."}
{"text":"An unassuming simple fast-food restaurant beside a gas station that can be easily looked over. We were the only people there for a sit-down meal, although plenty of patrons dropped in for takeout. Obviously a local favorite. We ordered the half-chicken feast, which was more than enough food for two people with leftovers for the next day. Four pieces of chicken (two breast, one leg, one thigh), one kebab (choice of chicken or beef), 6 wings, two sides and two cans of pop. All that for only $30 after tax!!  

The chicken breast was a little dry, but it not an issue when you drench it in the extra sauces that are available. The dark cuts of meat was cooked well and the flame-charred bites were especially good. The kebab was flavorful and unexpectedly spicy, even more so than the 'mild' sauce or the extra hot sauce. We had the onion rings and the peri rice as our two sides, both were great additions to all the meat on the table. 

Heads up that there isn't a lot of parking. Some cars were double parked behind the first row of cars and ppl were wandering around looking for their owners so they could get their cars out."}
{"text":"I walked in here knowing what I wanted. I simply showed the picture that Hazel M. took of the two piece chicken with corn on the side. I didn't even look at the menu. I just pointed at the picture and said, I want that. 

Five minutes later my food was ready to go.

Chicken was soft and tender and had nice flavouring with the sauce. The corn was sweet and fresh and went well the the sauce that it was topped with.

There are lots of seats for dining in. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a Co worker for lunch. While service might be a little slow, everything was made fresh. Food quality was excellent. I had the half chicken platter and it was delicious. Will return."}
{"text":"Unexpected good ! I am not expected having Portuguese in Scarborough. I had Nando in downtown which is not very impressive for the peri chicken . Although this small restaurant seems old outside, it was pretty new. The peri chicken is so good. Absolutely will come and visit more often."}
{"text":"About half the price of Nando's, and I'd say with better chicken too. Had the lemon & herb, as well as hot. Recommended."}
{"text":"Nice! Tastes great, awesome price
Got the Peri Peri Grilled Chicken"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I have been craving Portuguese grilled chicken for weeks now and decided to go to Nando's. I had a stale piece of chicken there with tiny handful of fries - for around 15 dollars. This place is much better than nandos!!! Fresh, amazingly grilled chicken, super great price. Peri fries are amazing and so is their hot sauce. I have already been there twice this week and probably will go a few more times. Only other thing I'll say is more people need to hear about this place, it should be on Zabiha app as it's HMA certified halal."}
{"text":"Have begun to come here for lunch regularly. They have a great menu and reasonable prices. The peri peri chicken and chicken wrap are my go to options. They are very very much comparable to nandos and HALAL. 

The food was delicious, the restaurant is very clean and the service is polite and proper. I highly recommend eating here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This copycat Nando's joint might look like a run down restaurant from the outside as it is located tucked away in a corner with a gas station but has proven itself over and over again. Outstanding chicken and great prices! I usually get the 8 pc meal and get 4 in the lemon sauce and the rest in extra hot sauce. You can just get plain chicken and ask for their sauces on the side to see which one you like. I would choose this place over Nando's any day. Their peri fries with home made aioli is on point! 10/10 food 

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service was superb 

Food was amazing. Chicken could have perhaps been cooked a tad better. But all their sauces were amazing and made up for it. 

Most fulfilling platter of food. 

Don't think about it go."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place with a colleague for lunch after naming about a dozen different food choices only to be met with an, 'I don't eat this and i don't eat that'. Finally, a food genre that would satisfy even the toughest eaters!

It's a small family run place. The odd placement of of industrial sprinklers behind the counter was explained by the fact that they had originally planned on selling shawarma but realized that it made the dining room too hot, so the idea was scrapped. 

I ordered the 2 piece chicken meal with a salad and my colleague ordered the same with fries. The chicken was tender and had that char in the right spots while the salad seemed quite fresh. It even had some cherry tomatoes in it. My colleagues fries were battered and he said they were really good. I do like their sauce. 

As far as price goes, they are really inexpensive. I think the chicken with 1 side was $6.99 plus tax! Not bad!

The family that owns this place seems really nice and are quite chatty. We quite liked it."}
{"text":"They have the best peri fries.. Chicken was good too prices are not bad 
Good location.. Slow service they really do need more staff"}
