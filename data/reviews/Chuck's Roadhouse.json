{"text":"Half priced wings every day after 9, $5 for a 32ounce beer on tuesday, $9 pitchers friday and the nachos are pretty good any day of the week. The wings and these other items are well worth a trip.  This is a restaurant with low prices and a fairly simple menu and a couple motorcycles hanging from the ceiling. Expect that your $5 burger and fry is going to taste like it was $5 and cooked under a motorcycle and youll be fine. When a 10oz striploin dinner is $12, dont get all pissy because the one you had at the keg for $30 was better. You could barely make it at home for that price. The food isnt bad, and the prices are more than fair. But nothing has ever wowed us (ive been 4-5 times for wings and tried something new off my friends' plates each time).  i prefer to get ripped off on something i love over a deal on something i dont, so this place isnt my scene. If i do go, wings and nachos are good.  I wish they had more than 4 beers on tap."}
{"text":"Always great. Nice steak and an amazing value. I can't believe how good this place is for the price. Cheap wings after 9."}
{"text":"I was drawn by its heralding of \"$10 AAA steak\", and finally dropped by with a friend after months of holding back due to reading of \"poor service\".   Restaurant size: Spacious and comfortable, the place was practically empty at noon on a Sunday. There is a huge corner booth with a round table, for larger groups. Alternatively, a bunch of row tables could probably be manoeuvred around if needed. Bright and well-lit during the day.  Food quality: Sure enough, we each got the $10* steak, which is a 7 oz. with beans and fries (alternatives available). The steak was cooked as ordered and had enough flavour I didn't need to put sauces on.  Service: Expecting the worst, it wasn't bad. The lone server was quick to take our orders, explained the sides available, and checked up on us.   Final thoughts: From 11am - 4pm their lunch menu also has a fish and chips deal for $8.99*! Why all these asterisks you may ask? Because nothing in their menu is ACTUALLY as priced...everything is subject to their \"Honest to Goodness Fee\". It is a 3% additional charge that \"...is required in order to allow [Chuck's to] maintain every day low prices and high quality...\"   Chuck's has chosen to maintain and advertise low prices, while printing out extra pages in the menu and desk signage justifying their practice. In fact, they go as far as saying \"look how little extra you're actually paying!!!\" and showing calculations. So, a $10* steak is actually $10.30, which after-tax would be $11.64. After tip (provided you had enough service to justify one...) it comes to at least $13. Multiply this by however many patrons in a day and...well, you might get the picture.  Just like an EULA (which you should also read), it pays (actually, WE pay) to read extra signs and fine print. However, just because its printed out doesn't mean its right.   But hey, at least the fries are good? I wonder how the fish fares..."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Mediocre food. Poor selection of draft beer. Random 3% goodness charge on the bill."}
{"text":"Has anyone noticed they put a 3 percent surcharge on food and beer/beverages!! Never going back! EVER!!"}
{"text":"I've been to 2 Chuck's locations and they're very consistent between the locations. Same decor, same menu, same awesome pricing, same yummy food. This location has really high ceilings and huge windows. Nice and bright!  After trying the quesadilla at the South Whitby location, that had BBQ chicken in it, I HAD to try the BBQ chicken burger. It was just as delicious as I expected. It will probably be my go-to on future visits!   Service was friendly and prompt, just like the other location. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.   The location of this restaurant hasn't had much luck with past businesses(I think the sushi place changed names 3 or 4 times), hoping this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely lit! Thursday night karaokes are a blast. The establishment went through some ownership change recently. I can guarantee that your experience will be far better this time around. The three times I've been there since, the owner made sure that my friends were looked after. The food is the usual bar food but really cheap. My $40 bill at chucks can easily be a $80 one at another bar. The drinks and food are really cheap and the service is unparalleled to the other more expensive bars I've been to. Overall, when in Whitby go to Chuck's!"}
{"text":"Presentation 1 star,  food value 3 stars, service 3.5 stars,   I like that you can get a 16oz rib steak for 20 bucks, and I also had a cheese burger as an appetizer and it represents a good value at (I think) 8 bucks. But the sides let this place down ; had a side salad with the burger (extra charge)  it was served in a tiny desert bowl maybe 3oz of salad very problematic. The sides with the stake was some dried out corn on the cob (no butter,  nothing,  just a dried our third of a cob) and some mediocre French fries. It's the details that this place has to improve on, the beef was prepared well,  everything else needs work.  I would go back and you should try it, but if restaurant management is reading this demand more from your kitchen, improve on the details and offer more (and better quality) of the inexpensive stuff (sides) and your table turns will increase"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but the ambience , staff and lack of beers on tap are what brings this one down to a two.  On the outside it looks all busy and cozy like a nicely country homey feel would be inside. Instead it's dull white and steel walls, the odd picture or item nailed to it very out of place . The tap had only 5 beers on it and the range was deeply lacking.  The food was good for the price I will say that.  But I sat and ordered a beer while I waited for my take out.  So two beers later I'm still wondering where my food is. The bartender tells me it's been ready for awhile she just wanted to wait till I was done.  Now although I appreciate the sentiment but when my food is ready TELL ME! So I can be the judge of when to finish or not.  Hardly any smiles from the staff and most just walk right past you as occasionally some large gentleman (possibility it's the owner) scowls over the bar and pays attention to the prettier waitresses.     The prices are low and that's all it has going for it.  Skip this if you can.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was lacking. Fries were very dry and burger was flavorless on a cheap bun. Prices are cheap but you get what you pay for. Maybe the wings and steak are better? Don't order a burger."}
{"text":"Chucks opened a while ago and I was deterred by the mediocre reviews I saw piling in. We decided to give it a shot one night as its the closest chain restaurant to our home and we both felt like meat (steak for him, ribs for me). I had hoped that if they were good, they'd become a good spot for us to walk to and have some drinks and enjoy a good time with friends.  We were seated pretty promptly after arriving and we placed our order shortly thereafter. I was a bit surprised at how small the menu was, I was expecting there to be more selection. I ended up going with a half rack of ribs with fries and my hubby went for a steak.  There was nothing special or noteworthy about my dinner. In fact, I was surprised that it arrived at the table at warm temperature, not hot. I mean, sure, you throw ribs on the grill to warm them up once they're already cooked but the fries should have been piping hot and they weren't. Given that the place was almost empty, I couldn't understand why that happened.   Service was nonexistent and you could tell the server wasn't really into being there. Well, neither was I. We left promptly after paying our bill and I highly doubt we'll ever go back. I had higher expectations for this place and they just fell flat. I don't get why people are saying this place is amazing, it was absolutely dead the entire time we were there. Sure, they've got lots of TVs, so I'm sure it'd be great to get drinks at and watch a game, but I'd spend your money elsewhere on food.   Disappointing at best, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went there hoping for a nice enjoyable dinner. The waitress was unfamiliar with drinks (martini's that were on the menu but didn't give a description, just the name). I ordered ribs ( as described by the waitress as meat falling off the bone). They not only didn't fall off the bone but I had to cut the ribs apart with a steak knife. My girlfriend ordered steak ( medium well ) and corn . Steak came rare and corn was cold. Manager came over and said she'd take care of it. The Steak was returned......crusty on the outside and still medium rare. Oh and they also charge an add'l 3% for the lamest excuse."}
{"text":"Went here with the family to check it out along with the other new stuff popping up in the plaza. Had a really nice burger. Maybe a little charred for my liking, but it was well made. Pretty fancy looking, sports on the TVs, and noticed a private dining room that could seemingly be booked for events. The manager came around and seemed really enthusiastic about running the place. He also explained their 3% surcharge on menu items, which is a really interesting business model to keep steak prices down. Makes for good prices on them as a result, and the increase on everything else is pretty negligible."}
{"text":"I have been to Chuck's a handful of times now and based on the average I feel it will be crossed off my list.  My reason for two stars is because it's open late,near my house, and the food is priced fair for what it is. The missing stars is because on two separate visits it took more than 30 mins for our food to come out,  we only ordered burger and one appetiser, and that's after we asked the bartender to please see what the problem is.  Both times there were max 6 other tables and after 9pm.  The disturbing thing is both visits the manager never even came to our table to explain the issues and the servers never even acknowledged the long wait. The table next to us over heard our conversation and told us 30 min wait on food is the average here."}
