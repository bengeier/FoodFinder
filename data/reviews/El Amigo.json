{"text":"Really good Mexican/Salvadorian food.  Simple decor, with funny Spanish TV playing.  HUGE portions, cheap prices, friendly staff.  Pupusas are off the HOOK!  I can also attest to the enchiladas, and burritos.  Also, no fee for BYO wine.  :)  Docked it one star for a less-than-great vegetarian selection, and they use some kind of Chinese veggie mix (I had water chestnuts and baby corn in my enchilada -- not exactly traditional, though still tasty)."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito plates I have ever eaten! The portions are enormous, the vegetables fresh and filling. The prices are reasonable for the portion size. I had to take my second burrito home for dinner."}
{"text":"There are only a couple things here that seem to be worth trying. The yucca con chicharon although the pork is slightly on the dry side but I havent had this dish anywhere where the pork wasnt. The pupasas are very good too and so is the plantain. Those are the only 3 dishes that I ever get here and they do them better than the other Salvadorian restaurants Ive been to in the city. The other dishes dont seem as interesting and arent that cheap either. Dont be scared by the terrible decor and by the fact that its always empty. If you enjoy those classic Salvadorian dishes its worth a try."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Good taste, generous portions and affordable prices. This was the first place where I had pupusas so many years ago. I'm not quite as enamored with them now as I was in the past mainly because I find them a bit heavy but they're still pretty cheap ranging from $2.50 to $2.80 and quite large too. I'd suggest going with loroco + cheese or maybe the pork one if you've never had a pupusa before. The coleslaw that comes with it has a nice tangy kick. The tomato sauce tastes more like a soup and is a nice compliment.  For my main, I had a tasty mixed taco plate which came with two tacos, (one beef, one chicken), salad, beans, rice and salsa ($13). This place is cash only (no debit, no credit). Not a big place but not small either. They seem to get more phone or takeout orders than sit-in customers."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this authentic Mexican/Salvadorian spot and was left disappointed. Service was slow, smell of cigarette from clients smoking outside (ventilation of the place needs an update).  The food was mediocre at best, the sopa de tortilla was ok, pupusas not so much, the only thing I enjoyed was the tuja. Overall there are better places around"}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place.  I've been here over a dozen times and have never had a bad meal.  The pupusas are the absolute best (range from $2.10 - $2.50 each).  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and they come piping hot.  You can hear them slapping the dough in the kitchen when you order them - so you know they are made fresh to order.  My favourite are the chicken and cheese ones.  I have to admit that I usually just gorge on pupusas but I have ordered other things here as well:  Chicken Tamales - $2.30: Good, but nothing remarkable (I'd rather have the pupusas).    Campo Combination Plate (chicken taco, chicken enchilada, rice, beans and salad) - $12.50: Very tasty with lots of chicken.  The salad is iceberg/romaine though, not real mixed greens.    Calamari - $7.75: Tender calamari rings fried to perfection.  Not rubbery or chewy at all.  One of the best places for calamari.       Seafood Paella - $18.25: Lots of seafood: calamari rings, shrimp, fish and mussels.  Calamari rings were so tender, shrimp were large and tasty, fish tasted fresh and didn't smell fishy, mussels were a good size and delicious.  The only slightly negative thing was that the rice was a little on the dry side, but it still tasted really good.  This place is on a little side street in Little Italy and looks like nothing much from the outside.  It's a mom and pop joint with tasty authentic food.  Most of the customers are Spanish-speaking and many people come for takeout.  Prices are good and portions are generous.  Service is polite and competent.    If you love pupusas and are in Montreal you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food here is authentic South American fare and everything we've had here was very good. The decor is frightful but don't go for the ambience, the food is the prize here.  Easily the best south American food in Montréal, but only 4 stars because the carne asada has been tough."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto il y a plus de vingt ans grâce à une amie.  C'est avec un brin de nostalgie que je retrouve leurs plats typiques de la cuisine latino-américaine dans un décor inchangé.  La yuca con chicharrón, les tamales et bien sûr les pupusas légèrement croustillantes à l'extérieur et moëlleuse à l'intérieur avec une garniture abondante et goûteuse.  Pour un repas savoureux, satisfaisant et très bon marché."}
{"text":"Fantastic little Salvadorean/Mexican joint in Little Italy.  A hole-in-the-wall family establishment that is usually filled with large Latino groups and Mexican soap operas blaring from a large screen television. Portions are ridiculously large and cheap (the centro americano costs around $14 and is a steak that comes with rice, black beans, plantains, tortilla, etc,etc). It's bring your own wine and.or beer as well so you can't lose. The pupusas - El Salvadorean specialty, a savoury filled pancake - are also delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bean pupusas are $2.10 and come with unlimited curtido and tomato sauce. Two are more than enough for me for dinner. The guacamole & chips are a bit pricier ($6) but are delicious and a good size to split between two people. While other pupserias in the area might have nicer decor, this place stands out for being the cheapest I've seen (without sacrificing quality) and for being BYOB. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and first time trying el-salvadorian food. I got the Mexicali combo plate with a strawberry fizz drink.  It was quite delicious especially the rice and beans combo.  Tried the tamarind juice for the first time which wasn't too bad either.    Food: 3/5, piping hot and flavourful but he steak was somewhat chewy.   Service: 3/5, nothing out of the ordinary. The man cannot speak too well but he was nice.  The place was quite empty during lunch on a Sunday so it seemed like they were making our food from scratch.  Ambience: 2/5, old decor, not the nicest place but the food was good enough for a return visit  Price: 3/5, about $20-25 per person with drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Pupusas! This place is great for groups, as there is usually lots of space! The pupusas are delicious and cheap cheap cheap. I believe the prices have gone up no more than 25 cents in the last ten years! This is the place to go to eat well for under $10. Get at least one pupusa with loroco spice. The enchiladas are good to start with. Hot sauce is hot so watch it. BYOB, boo yah."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant ! The food is very fresh and comes in generous portions, the staff is friendly and really wants to make you satisfied. It was my first time trying Salvadorian food and certainly not the last time!!! Try it!!! :)"}
{"text":"The service was very good by both the waiters and owner himself. The food was very delicious.. Very fresh and hot. Will come back again"}
