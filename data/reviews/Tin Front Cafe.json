{"text":"This is a great little cafe in a terrible location, but I hope for the best as businesses try to resurrect this area.  I hope it sticks.  The cafe was cute and comfortable.  A small bar area seats about 8-10.  A back patio is great if you happen to be out with your pooch and want to stop in.  For a late dinner, we were presented with a dinner menu that had about 5-8 choices for the day.  Everything on the menu sounded good.  Snooty food....my kind of food.  A dinner salad preceded our meal that was mixed greens with a raspberry vinaigrette with shaved Parmesan.  Not bad.  Not much to it, but not bad.  For my entree, I ordered the portabella mushroom stuffed with corn risotto surrounded with red beet and cabbage slaw.  Sounds amazing, right?  It was bland.  Could have been a fabulous meal, but it was definitely lacking something.  My mom ordered the black bean zucchini burrito.  It looked beautiful, but again, the taste was lacking.  I give them an A for effort.  The cafe is great and the menu presentation is awesome.  The food just needs some more flavor.  We need more places like this in the area.  I really hope they stick around."}
{"text":"The oil we were given was rancid. The staff on duty that night gave us newer, fresher oil but didn't really seem that sorry about it. The food that night was kind of blah, except for the brie. Was so disappointed because I loved everything the last visit!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the Tin Front Cafe. They have a limited menu and a bit of a long wait for the food, but it is worth it. Nice casual atmosphere. Daniel and Ellie are wonderful. I wish them all the best with their establishment. This is a true gem of a place and the food is all homemade and delicious. Must visit. will be back again and again. always check Allegheny county health department website for this and any other establishment you are dining at http://webapps.achd.net/Restaurant/RestaurantSearch.aspx"}
{"text":"Taste: yum. Service: friendly. Presentation: unappetizing. We had carrot ginger risotto, very tasty but arrived in a large loaf-like lump. Also pierogi lasagna, tasty but colorless and not appealing to look at. Salads were very good, the infused vodka cocktail very nice. Will try them again."}
{"text":"Three of us went there for Sunday brunch at 11 AM. We had hoped to talk, but the noise was so deafening we barely could communicate wth the servers or each other. A birthday party with small children had taken over half the place & the children were screaming and  running everywhere. The service was chaotic and rushed. My entree arrived 20 minutes after the rest of my party had been served. No explanation, other than \"we're busy\". The food either was bland or excessively spicy, \"one note\" tastes with no complexity. The quiche was greasy and undercooked. A \"Southern Comfort\" burrito with kale, eggs & beans again was undercooked. We hurried from the place to a coffee shop so we could talk. Didn't try dessert since we were eager to leave."}
{"text":"Lots of great vegetarian options.  Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is pretty laid back.  Great for dinner or Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"In two words: loved it!  This is my first review here. I guess it says it all...  I've been there twice. First time was with some friends on a Sunday -- the food was great, but the atmosphere was even better. This place has a unique feeling to it, and just take a look at the attached store or at the costumers and you'll understand.  It was an Elvis Presley brunch, so they had some warm peanut-butter sandwiches and were playing some vinyl records.  I went again today, with my mom. She's a picky eater, and yet, she loved her Omelette, the homefries, the coffee, and the place itself. I had the Quiche and it was excellent.   Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Tin Front Cafe is a great little vegetarian cafe in Homstead, across the tracks from the Waterfront. We went for dinner and the food was really good and reasonably priced. Both the butternut squash lasagna and the eggplant parmesan on polenta were delicious and they both came with sizable side salads that you would normally pay another $4-5 dollars for in other places (or they would jack up their entree price to compensate). Here you get both for under $10.   With locally grown food making up a good menu, a nice space, free wifi, a beer/wine menu, I hope this place thrives in their unlikely location."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Had to convince my fiance it's ok not to eat meat sometimes. I am a coffee snob and they had great coffee!  Try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Also, their bloody mary's are to die for. Also everyone who works here is very nice & the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. It was ok. Nice staff ok menu . Had veggie chili did not have the consistency of chili too thick it was more like ratatouille in a bowl good taste though. It was served with French bread that was a little on the stale side some organic blue corn chips a much better choice and more Tex Mex style. Next had the spinach portabello moz cheese quesadilla really good. Bad choice of hot sauce that it is served with. They use sriracha hot chili sauce not really good with once again Tex Mex dish.  cholula a Mexican hot sauce better choice for both dishes or even Texas Pete or make your own not hard . The hot sauce they serve is great with asian style , and yes it matters. Would prob go back if someone really really wanted to go and talked me into it,  but prob will not they have some kinks to fix."}
{"text":"I wish this was in the squirrel hill/oakland area, since that area is mostly where we end up going if we have to eat out. But the food is great. I have always enjoyed sitting in the patio outside for an early summer dinner before catching a movie at the water front."}
{"text":"The food is SO GOOD, and the customer service is good too! This is really one of my favorite places to go for brunch. Mmm...."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed dinner here. The menu has several things we wanted to try. We settled for black bean hummus, four bean chili, ratatouille over polenta (with sauteed spinach) and ginger carrot risotto stuffed portabello (also with sauteed spinach). Both entrees were served with a dinner salad.  Fresh food, clean restaurant - great night out!"}
{"text":"The dinner options are all very tasty.  They start w/ nice sized salads followed by decent sized entrees.  I am impressed by the options (vegan, gluten free) and flavors, which change frequently.  The squash bisque was very delicious and the chocolate fondue was vegan. Nice martini options. Reasonably priced.  My omnivorous friends loved it too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed very much.     Veg chili tasty.   A good quesadilla w mushroom and spinach about $8.   Lovely people.  Free newspapers to read. Nice kitchen store attached.  Menu is per day.  Little patio in back and bar in front.     Looking forward to next visit.    Just a few blocks from waterfront shopping area."}
{"text":"My lunch was a terrible mistake. I ordered the grilled swiss cheese and pear sandwich. The barely detectable sliver of swiss cheese was lost in the center of two slices of HUGE bread. The less than generous 2-3 thin slices of pear was dreadfully over-seasoned with cinnamon. I basically paid $8.95 for 2 oversized pieces of toast and a small portion of greens. I also had a less than generous sized bowl of chili, which was tasty. At the peak of the lunch hour, there was myself, my friend and one other person in the place. Will never return."}
{"text":"A vegetarian restaurant that also has a full bar? Yes!!! But, that's not all. Tin Front Cafe also has delicious and fresh vegetarian food with a full bar serving drinks made from house infused vodka. I would highly recommend this place and look forward to going back for brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome healthy food! Full bar! Friendly local (Homestead) staff! What more do yall need."}
{"text":"A very unique place! Great food,  a nice wine selection and friendly staff! The outside area is very quaint! Looking forward to sitting on the patio this summer for a Sunday Funday"}
{"text":"First time visit today for lunch....limited choices but I was more than happy with the spicy spinach portabella quesadilla. My companion was equally pleased with her spinach quiche & salad.   We weren't offered dessert, but maybe they don't serve it.  Acoustically, it's on the noisy side, but  the selection of music that was playing was enjoyable.  Definitely met the criteria of places I would visit again.     The adjoining shop was a bonus.  Wonderful selection of items, beautifully displayed in compact space."}
{"text":"What a great spot for brunch!  We just visited for the first time and really enjoyed ourselves. For $12 you get an entree (we had the quiche and a burrito) and an array of buffet items, which today included home fries, chili and fixings, corn muffins and chocolate chip muffins, chocolate chip cookies, salad, melons, coffee, juice and iced teas! There is a full bar so you can add a drink to your meal. I got the Bloody Mary with house-infused habanero and cilantro vodka. It was perfect, with a little bite! The ambience was great, with the back of the restaurant opened up to the lovely patio and the skylights letting in lots of sun. I can't wait to bring friends here!  Yes, it's all vegetarian or vegan but I do believe all tastes can be accommodated."}
{"text":"Comfort food vegetarian you can take your meat eating friends to, and they won't even miss a beat. Great people and great food. They treat you like family there."}
{"text":"Excellent chili,  black bean hummus and lasagna.  Coming from a non-vegetarian, this vegetarian restaurant is really good."}
{"text":"I want to make it very clear what you're walking in to.  This is a vegan restaurant.  I was very unclear what this was before I went in so don't expect any meat or big greasy dishes. With that being said, this being my first vegan dining experience, it made me want to do it more often, everything was fantastic,  The location is on 8th Ave in Homestead.  It's charming, welcoming & clean.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, if it's summer I suggest sitting out back.  The food.  Dear lord baby Jesus it was awesome!  We got the peas and greens siracha quesadilla and if I just ate that I'd be stuffed.  Something about the legumes and greens that really makes you feel full.  We also got the black bean burger and my only gripe was I wish it was a bit more solid, it was a little mushy, but it's still a 9/10 black bean burger!  I also got a Bloody Mary and the mix is made in house, you could tell.  Refreshing at 2:00pm!  If you're looking for a light meal in the day and you're vegan or even not, Tin Front Cafe is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Great shot, easy to find just the right plate for any appetite. We had Black bean hummus Spinach salad w shaved beets, apples, almonds, and Gorgonzola. Black eyed peas & kale w ginger and onion. Ratatouille over polenta. Butternut squash lasagna. Sounds like a lot of food but the small plates were perfect sized for good appetites. The menu changes frequently and there seems to be something for everybody."}
{"text":"Delicious wholesome food, an excellent and varied menu, and a delightful bar with home-made infusions and quirky specialties make this a consistent good choice only blocks from the waterfront. Try the Sunday brunch! The southern comfort burrito is the best, but you will have a hard time deciding."}
{"text":"Did we all eat at the same restaurant or did my friends and I enter some kind of twilight zone when we stopped here for brunch last Sunday???  The place was cute and the servers were friendly, but the food was just meh.  We got the spinach & gorgonzola omelette, the black bean burrito (vegan & non vegan), and also had access to the buffet, which served muffins, chili, and potatoes.  Our entrees were bland, and the chili tasted burnt... the potatoes were pretty much the only saving grace of the meal.  I guess the chocolate covered blueberries/raspberries they served with the check were good... but then again, they didn't make those."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem. Family owned and operated, this is truly loving soul food but with such a refined execution. Daniel is a sweetheart and a wealth of knowledge, his wife the chef had an inspired mind for creative dishes. Acornicopia was a holiday special and I swear it was thanksgiving in that dish !! Can't wait to return !!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I managed to just visit this cafe for the firs time after having lived in Pittsburgh for four years, and having been a vegetarian for twenty. Nice to go out to eat and be able to choose from anything on the menu, rather than find the one vegetarian thing on the menu.  My husband had been here for lunch, but for some reason it just hadn't made it on to our dinner circuit yet. So glad we made it, because we'll definitely be frequent patrons now!  I have a hard time describing the decor inside, but it was perfect.... clean looking, modern paint and decor.... just a very nice ambiance, jazz playing, & nice lighting. We went in on a Saturday night around 5pm, and there was a table of six already there, and another couple came in later. I like that it was NOT loud, busy and crazy in this restaurant. So relaxing, and calm.   Our waiter was friendly. I can agree with other reviews that said the service was slow, so I wouldn't go if you are in a rush. My husband said he went on lunch break once and was 45 minutes late getting back to work. The service wasn't that slow when we were there, but it definitely wasn't speedy. This isn't something I mind though. It was more of a chance to enjoy the environment, and spend time talking.  Our food was pretty amazing, and the portion sizes were big. We started baked brie. This was seasonally done, with cinnamon, clove and apple. This was my favorite part of the meal! So delish. For entrees, I had the perogie lasagna and my husband had the quiche. After such a large appetizer, I was only able to eat half of my entree but my husband still had room to devour his entire plate. Perogie lasagna was gooey, hot and definitly a winter comfort food.  I noticed on the menu online perogie lasagna isn't listed... so maybe they change things up slightly for the seasons?   I think anyone could find something they like on the menu really. It's worth the drive if you want to find someplace new to eat. It's definitely worth checking out if you are already in the Waterfront and don't want to eat at a big chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome service, beautiful decor, great vegetarian food, which is still hard to find in the 'burg.  We sat outside in their courtyard patio.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Incredible vegetarian dishes, real gem of a restaurant, salads are great!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Tin Front three times, but every time I've been there I've been satisfied. The first two times I got Mac n cheese. I always try my boyfriends food and he had some kind of squash ravioli that wasn't my style, but I could see other people liking it.   Today I went for the brunch buffet. You get to pick one entree and can go to the buffet for sides. My boyfriend and I shared spiced pear pancakes and a slice of broccoli cheddar quiche. My friend and her boyfriend got the spinach quiche and the pear pancakes. The quiches were delicious, filled with tons of cheese, and cooked perfectly. The Bloody Mary's we ordered we only $5 but we paid the $1.50 extra for the horseradish infused vodka (and it was well worth it.) The bloody's were smooth and very refreshing.  The buffet area had: a selection of muffins, cookies, and bread in one area, fruit and salad in the next section, and a hot area that had very flavorful (maybe a tiny bit too spicy) potatoes and vegetarian chili. I thought everything was awesome and I ate way too much.  The place is also adorable, clean, and has very friendly and professional staff. If you're in the waterfront homestead area and want something unique/vegetarian/generally healthy, Tin Front should be a place you check out."}
{"text":"I'm super let down by Tin Front.  I'm going to give them a pass and revisit the next time I'm in Homewood, but my guess is my experience was \"meh\" for several reasons.  1.  Odd time (4pm) 2.  Lunch (vs. dinner) 3.  Service issues  Based on others' reviews, I was excited to grab an early dinner prior to a meeting in the area.  After waiting for 10 minutes for someone to actually pay attention to me, I was met with one of the most awkward exchanges I've ever had.  A man (couldn't tell if he was the owner, a server, a bartender, etc.) just randomly appeared and didn't really say anything.  After I was able to confirm he was in fact associated with the restaurant, apparently we never did connect on exactly how to order food (i.e. sit down at a table with service, order at the bar, etc.).  After almost walking out on the exchange, I finally placed an order for an arugula salad and coffee at the bar and grabbed a seat at a table.  The saving grace that rescues Tin Front is that the food was decent.  Nothing that blew me away, but definitely a solid offering.  I wish that the dinner menu would have been available, because many of the options online did look quite appetizing.  Either way, the experience stands as-is.  Until I get a chance to revisit this joint, it'll sit as a 2-star in my book."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! What a hidden gem!!! I highly reccomend this place. Everything is A+, from service, to food, to atmosphere. If you have not been here yet, you are truly missing out.   This inside is very cozy, clean, upcycled chic. It has a very comfortable feel to it. The full service bar is absolutely beatiful, it kind of has a saloon feel. The outside patio is super quaint and peaceful.   The food is out of this world. The flavors are amazing and everything is fresh and local. They make and bake all of their bread, if this gives you an idea of how amazing this place is!!!! The portions are huge too!!! I never had a bad meal as everything is delicious!!!  Go for lunch or dinner and I promise you will be back again! They also have a Sunday brunch that I am anxious to try!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito. It was too leafy. Walnut muffins were tasty. Everything else was ordinary. Nothing memorable. Oh they made us wait for more than an hour."}
{"text":"Wonderful food served in a charming ambiance. I took my vegetarian friend here, and was delighted to see so many vegetarian options to chose from. We experienced  great service. The Tin Front is a great place for a quiet conversation and enjoying unique food. The Chili with mashed potatoes was an unusual treat, and it turns out it is a traditional Italian recipe.  Their vegetarian Chili won an award, which is a high honor in my book.  They have some quirky modern sculpture on the patio, which all adds to the charm.  What a fun place for food and conversation!"}
{"text":"Oh man so good. This place is a gem in the rough. Don't go to Bar Louie. Come to this place. I came down here on a Tuesday and it was empty. Ridiculous. Risotto stuffed portobellos was delicious, as was spinach salad. Awesome old fashioned and delicious wine selection. Five stars. Don't be a corporate drone. Support you mom and pops."}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch there (which is evidentially a big Pittsburgh thing to do), and I enjoyed it thoroughly! Nice clean ambiance, and personal attention from the owner. Everything I had from the brunch bar was  just delish! I would definitely recommend, and I will return here next time I am in Pittsburgh!  Don't forget to check out the interesting kitchen gadget shop attached to the restaurant!  A+!"}
{"text":"I am so very disappointed with my visit to Tin Front Cafe today. So much so, in fact, that I am writing my first review.  My friend and I stopped in for a late lunch. After an incredibly awkward exchange with a woman who we weren't even sure worked there, we were sat. The same woman, who we now know to be our waitress, brought us water and a menu. We sat for fifteen minutes, watching her sit at the bar and chat with another gentleman. After getting her attention, we gave her our order, which amounted to two cups of butternut bisque and two grilled sandwiches. Twenty minutes later, our soup is up. The chef rings a bell and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. After some time, the man sitting at the bar gets up to bring us our soup. We ask for silverware, we ask for napkins-- he brings them to the table after searching behind the bar reluctantly. We still aren't sure if he worked there.  There is a hair in my friends soup. We wait, still no waitress.  She comes back into the room and looks at our full bowls. This is after another ten minutes. She approaches our table and says, \"You can't finish your soup?\" to which I reply, \"There is a hair in her soup.\" She asks \"Where?\" and we point, still floating in the bowl. She then says, \"I don't see it. You must have better eyes than me,\" as she proceeds to take the bowl to the bar and find her glasses to search for the hair. Working in the service industry our whole lives, we are both mortified. She comes back to the table with the bowl and tells us she found it. No apology, no other acknowledgement, just \"Well, what's wrong with your soup then?\" I explained I wasn't interested in my soup after finding the hair. I explained I would gladly pay for it, it just wasn't appetizing to me anymore. She disappears again.  At this point, we have waited an hour for two grilled cheese sandwiches and have been treated like we weren't supposed to be there. When she reappeared, she called to us from the kitchen window, \"Don't you want your sandwiches?\" as the bell rang. She brought us our lunch, and said \"Remember when I told you it was shift change?\" We were so confused what that had to do with us, or the hair in our soup, or her general rudeness. At this point, we were both very uncomfortable, so I went to the bar to request our check and a couple of boxes. She proceeded to tell me that they make everything fresh and that's why it takes time, and asked \"Have you ever been here?\" I told her that I had been here quite a few times and couldn't wait to bring my friend in, but that this was unlike any other experience I have ever had.   It was the single most awkward encounter in a restaurant I've had. We don't particularly care about the wait for the food, it was the fact that we were treated so poorly, as if we were inconveniencing the employees by supporting their business. Needless to say, I will not be visiting or recommending the Tin Front Cafe in the future."}
{"text":"I called here one day from work with the intent on trying it out and it was great!  [I cannot do my typical \"Pros/Cons\" type of review because we ordered take-out and I was not the \"gopher\" on this order.]  The woman that I spoke to on the phone was very sweet and helpful and even was willing to fax us a menu for the day. She called me back and left me a message to inform me that they tried to fax and it wasn't working and also wanted to know if there was some other way to get it to us--how freaking nice was that?!?  :)  Anyhow, we were able to pull up a menu from the \"interwebz\" and ordered from it with some help (again) from the staff on the phone.  I ordered the Carrot & Ginger Risotto filled Portabella Mushroom with sautéed spinach and that came with a Mixed Greens Salad with \"Craisons\" and Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.  It was very tasty!   I have a friend who is a vegetarian who informed me that he and his GF go there often and they highly recommend the Mac & Cheese, apparently, its like no other! They are also large fans of the fresh mixed drinks that they'll whip up for you! (I'd loooove to give those a whirl!)  :D  Additionally, this friend informed me that they've spent a good deal of time discussing the restaurant with some of the workers and they go, daily, for fresh produce and their menu changes based on the freshest ingredients that they can obtain. So, today, the risotto may be Carrot and Ginger and tomorrow it might be something else--not bad, but if you're looking for a favorite, go for something safer like the Mac & Cheese.  RECOMMENDATION:  That Risotto stuffed Portabella was great!!  (Idea on Pricing?  2 order of the Risotta/Portabella and 1 Chili Bake w/ Salad was approx $35)"}
{"text":"It was good. Not amazing, but good. It is quite cozy too. It's good enough where if I lived close by, I'd be a regular, but otherwise it'll probably be an occasional stop-in. If you're a vegetarian, it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Nice and quiet. Sweet employees.  A good place for a first date.  Went Friday night after leaving Macy's around 9:20pm. Thought it was open after seeing the front door open and few people sitting around the bar. They close at 9:00 but let me in for a meal.  Good ...because I was one starvin Marvin.  Ordered the butternut squash lasagna w/ side salad (now $12.95) and a Tom Collins(from the bar) for JUST $3.95.  The guy was honest about \"not being a bartender and using a mixed drink book\".  Heck, his drink was wayyyyyy better than any bar around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We arrived here two hours before a concert at the nearby Carnegie Library Music Hall.  We were the first diners to arrive.  I ordered their ratatouille which was served on a bed of polenta, and my wife their butternut squash lasagna.  The accompanying salads were reasonably sized and tasty.   Our entrees were both very good.  I'm the sweets lover in the family and I thought the butternut squash lasagna was almost sweet enough to have as dessert, but my wife disagreed.  If this review were just based on the food, I would give them an additional star, but service was a problem.  Our waitress was the only waitress, and she was very overtaxed.  Most of the tables had filled up after we had arrived, and all but one had emptied before we left.  Our big mistake was to ask for a dish of ice cream and two double espressos.  When we ordered them, we had been there an hour and 20 minutes.  Our waitress got busy getting all the other diners their bills and after a half hour we flagged her down and said to forget the ice cream and espresso and just bring us the check. There appears to be only three people who work there; 2 in the kitchen and 1 (our waitress) in the dining room.  While that may be good economically, one person can not provide proper service to their entire dining room.   Also, their wine list needs help.  They listed a Georges Debouff Beaujolais Nouveau, 2011 as being from California.  And it actually was the 2011 vintage.  I ordered their Pinot Noir instead.  I had been forewarned that I should not necessarily expect the actual wine on the list, just the type (Pinot Noir, Merlot, etc.)  The waitress returned with a single glass of wine.  I told her I wanted a bottle for my wife & I.  We got our bottle of Vampire Pinot Noir.  We might return if we are in the area, especially in warm weather when we could sit outside in their cozy looking patio, but only if we have no where to be by a specific time."}
{"text":"Attending a show at the nearby Carnegie Music Hall and not wanting to eat at the nearby  Water-(Let's-buy-goods-made-in-China-in-chain-stores-located-on-the-site-where-a-steel-mill-that-paid-union-wages-used-to-be) front, I decided to stop here for a bite beforehand.  I've got nothing against chain restaurants, but I needed a little break from your P.F. Chang's and Dave & Busters of the world.    But be advised--Tin Front is a vegetarian, but by no means vegan place.  A lot of their stuff has eggs and/or cheese.  Me, I went for the apple & cheddar grilled cheese with a side of home fries & red peppers.  No I'm not switching to a vegetarian diet, but who'd ever thought that vegetarian chow could be comfort food?  Tin Front doubles up as a coffeehouse too, so I'm gonna have to come back here some time for some Joe."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I will definitely make it a point to go back. The perogie lasagna was amazing :D"}
{"text":"I decided to explore homestead as I'm not very familiar with that part of town other than the mall at the waterfront. I'm also not a big fan of malls, so was looking to explore the neighborhood vibe.  My overall impression is that it's a sleepy and quiet borough with a lot of beautiful churches. 8th street has a few shops and restaurants, but what stood out to me was the blight.  Truth be told I landed at this restaurant because I was looking for a coffee shop to charge my phone while getting a small bite to eat. When I walked in, there was another party wrapping up their meal, but the restaurant was largely empty. My server was really nice and pointed me to a few things on the menu I could try. I settled on the spicy spinach quesadilla. I liked the sound of spinach, mushrooms and cheese. I also ordered a cup of coffee.  The quesadilla was A-okay. It was very cheesy, so if that's your thing, you'd love this dish. The coffee wasn't great at all. First it came luke warm and the size of the cup was rather small. I didn't bother to bring it to my server's attention.   I like the concept of a vegan/vegetarian restaurant, but probably wouldn't return to this location."}
{"text":"Wonderful Brunch! The breakfast menu is changed weekly but the food at the brunch bar is not. That's really the only complaint I have. I've had dishes there that I wasn't crazy about but not because of quality... Mostly because I try to eat as randomly as possible. The food is always served hot and I've never had poor service. All in all it's just good local food at a great bargain for the quality. Would be a 5 star if they would change the brunch bar pr at least alter it occasionally!"}
{"text":"I am a VERY happy vegan!   From the black bean hummus to the ratatouille over polenta our meal was absolutely amazing!  The food was fresh and  beautifully  prepared.  The staff was warm and friendly... We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tin Front Cafe is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I may be biased because I am a vegetarian, but I have brought a ton of my non vegetarian friends and they equally enjoyed it and most times didn't believe they were eating a vegetarian meal.  The food is amazing, great prices, the homemade vodka infusions are amazing, the service is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the chili will require return visits to satisfy cravings.  A must in pittsburgh.  Do know that they cook everything fresh, so sometimes it can be a little on the slower side.  I find this to be a good thing, but if you are in a hurry, maybe not the best place for you."}
{"text":"Adore this place. It's super out of the way for me, but it's worth it. The atmosphere is a mixture of diner and artsy. The service is good, and the food and alcohol are reasonably priced. The best part? Everything is vegetarian, with vegan and gluten free options also available.  Favorite items: 4 bean chili Mac and cheese Quiche Peas and greens  I'm hoping to find time to go back there to try more things! So far only been for dinner a few times. Always delicious. It goes to show that Southern food can be healthy and veg friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find in Homestead!   Bobby and i were shopping in the Waterfront. It was freezing and we just wanted to warm up with some coffee before heading home. I know there is a coffee shop in target, but im not a fan of that chain's coffee (tastes like a burnt bean if you ask me) I usually prefer smaller coffee shops and trusted Yelp to help me find one. Tin Front Cafe was recommended and just around the corner.   What a cute little shop! Tin Front Cafe offers food, booze and (delicious) coffee. I ordered a chai with soy since i'm watching what I eat. My boyfriend ordered a caramel Latte. The taste of tin fronts latte was amazing. Ellie informed us they use special beans (forgot where she said they were from) The result was a bold yet rich and smooth latte.   I checked out their food menu which had unique options as well as plenty of vegan and gluten free options. Ellie also mentioned that there is a store next door. We had to run but no doubt we will be back. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The Tin Front Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants. I've tried the broccoli/cheddar quiche, spinach/swiss quiche,  smoked swiss and pear sandwich, and the summer squash omelette.  I'm a vegetarian, and it's really great (and frankly unexpected) to have a vegetarian restaurant just five minutes from my house. Everything I've has has been really really good. The food takes a while to get to the table, so this really isn't a quick lunch, but it's worth the wait. Definitely check out the brunch. Last time I went, there were spicy potatoes, chili (SO SO GOOD), and a couple different muffins to choose from along with the entree."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant in up and coming Homestead.  Run by Daniel and Ellie  this place is truly a joy.  The food is fresh (TFC promotes locally grown ingredients), and the menu is ecletic without going over the top.  The place has a casual but chic feel and the prices are very reasonable.  TFC has an open air courtyard in the back and excellent art on the wall, many of the pieces from David Lewis, CMU Architecture professor and local artist.  David's wife, Judy runs an excellent kitchen store next door.   This is one of the few restaurants in Pittsburgh where the food actually makes me feel good an hour later.  Its common to have a good meal, but few places make you so happy for having eaten there.    Last night we had what has to be the best Tamales in Pittsburgh-- corn meal filled with spicy black beans and cliantro, and, ratatouille over a bed of polenta and sauteed spinach, and baked brie topped with orange puree and walnuts.   My wife had a dinner size spinach salad.  All four were top notch, nicely presented without being pretentious and the portions were perfect.  I would rather eat here than swanky Eleven where they turn up their noses, serving minuscule portions  dragged out over many hours, presenting a bombshell bill at the end.  For my taste, I might call TFC the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Not for the views, not because the wait staff and the tables wear white linen, and not for the wine list.  But for the imaginative, creative menu and bang for the buck, this restaurant is hard to beat."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise this morning! My mom's co worker suggested this place and I'm glad she did! If you're looking to get out of corporate waterfront and see the real side of homestead, and support a local business, you should check it out. It's vegetarian and vegan food and locally grown deliciousness. Very cute, comfortable decor, Vintage retro. Great music too, sang along all through brunch. I had the spicy quesadilla with spinach, portobello, and mozzarella, with siracha. Soo good! My mom had quiche with a fresh salad. Also delicious!  Light and crispy crust. Will certainly be going back! They also have a full bar and a cute shop connected with kitchen gadgets!"}
{"text":"How did it take so long to find out about this place?! Beautiful warm inviting comforting feel, I did not want to leave to return to work, but felt refreshed to do so! Recovering from an URI, the young lady helped me choose a nice smooth ginger tea. Just had to have some quiche which came with a fabulous salad! Spoke with the wonderful owner, , shared my love for the place. Next time I'm allowing time to shop a The Annex cookery next door!"}
{"text":"Partner and I headed down last night before Harry Potter 7.2!  What a lovely surprise!  Atmosphere is probably the best part of this place.  Very chill euro cafe feel with a hybrid alcohol/espresso bar, tables in the back, a back patio and live jazz DJ.  Food comes in a close second.  2-3 salads at $6-8, couple of apps and 4-5 entrees from $10-15.  Goes without saying it is all vegetarian and they are very careful to ask if you want cheese or anything else in case you are vegan.  Partner had the kale and black eyed peas over grits, her favorite dish to make!  It was a large portion, and fairly tasty.  I had the corn risotto over a portabello cap with sauteed spinach.  Dear chef: don't be afraid to use salt!  Especially if you don't put it on the tables!  Both dishes were tasty and inventive but frankly they were tempting fate with the big \"B\" word!  Just wasn't as satisfying as vegetarian and vegan food can be.  That slight misfire is all that kept me from giving 5 stars.  Oh, and they have a full bar!  The martinis looked good but we went with beer, with about 10 decent selections.  Wine list is a bit less inspired with 4 grocery store by the glass offerings.  Service was excellent, we basically had two servers attending to our every need.  Can be a bit loud!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am a tad surprised to see this Vegetarian restaurant in Homestead.  While it is not Vegan, it does have some fully Vegan options.  The smells were good, but I didn't come in for food.  While they do have a full bar, I came in for some hot drinks.  They have a fairly large compliment of boutique teas that you can mix and I will eventually return to get a Jasmine-Oolong blend.  Today I just ordered a Hot Apple Cider.  Good cider in a good business.  I wish it were in a better location.  What makes the location bad?  Not a lot of parking."}
{"text":"Continuing our losing streak, we had a disappointing brunch at the Tin Front Cafe. Now, I know that Pittsburgh can do vegetarian, having gone to Quiet Storm a couple years back. Alas, they have gone to the great carrot juicer in the sky, so we decided to check out Tin Front for a Sunday brunch. I will say this: their baked goods are more than reasonable, but you don't go out to brunch for the cookies.   I got the mushroom gorgonzola omelette and Heather and got the apple-brie French toast. The omelette was a lumpy affair of huge blue cheese pieces and a couple slices of mushroom. I took out some of the cheese chunks and put them on top of the salad, which otherwise consisted of limp mixed greens with cranberries and shaved carrots. I tried to round it out with the chili, but that was just too tomato-y.   The homefries were cayenne-spicy without having much flavor, and the coffee was weak. The French toast, made (bafflingly) from baguette, had not been in egg very long, and therefore trended closer to plain old toast.  The bloody mary was good with the house-infused horseradish vodka, but it did not justify the trip. I appreciate that there is a certain intrinsic value to a vegetarian restaurant, but this one didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  Overall, it's A-OK in my book.  The salads are fresh and quite tasty.    For dinner, I've tasted a little bit of everything.  My favorite though is the squash lasagna.  Just add a little salt, and it is great!  On most of the dishes, I find myself having to add salt to get some more flavor.  So flavor is a little bland here, but hey it's healthy and vegetarian!   However, service here can be ridiculously slow, even when there is hardly anyone in the place.  Hence the 3 stars.    I would go back for sure though."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast. Delicious food, and we non-vegetarians didn't even miss the meat. Highly recommend. Patio seating in the back - you'll forget you're in Homestead!"}
{"text":"The cafe is cute; the back patio is nice, and the decor inside is artsy without being TOO artsy.  The service was really, really slow. I was there with two friends -- we were the only customers in the whole place, and it took us two hours to get through the meal. 30 minutes for a salad, an hour for an appetizer (which came after the salad, because they forgot about it), and then an hour and a half for our dinners.    They were insistent that we order alcohol, even though none of us drinks. They had three or four alcohol menus, and instead of bringing them all at once, they waited and brought a new one every time we refused an old one. \"Are you sure you don't want something from the bar?\" Yes, for the third time, we're sure.   We ordered the baked brie as an appetizer, which was very tasty. I had the corn risotto in mushroom caps, which was good, if very bland. I agree with another reviewer - the kitchen should use some salt on these! My side to this dish was some spinach in vinegar. It was cold, pungent, and not at all what I expected from \"sauteed spinach\" on the side. I couldn't even stand the first bite and nearly had to spit it out. My companions seemed to enjoy their black bean burritos. The kitchen was not accommodating to a customization without tomatoes.   It might be worth it if you're going here for some music and appetizers. I probably won't be going back, though."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Thursday with 3 other dining companions.  We had decided on this place after having read some good previous reviews on it and since one of our group was vegetarian.  Upon entering the restaurant we were confused about whether to seat ourselves or not as no one was around to tell us.  After a minute or so of confusion the waitress eventually sat us.  The décor of the restaurant was not much to look at with the feel of an old run down café with a beer cooler, bar and open window into the kitchen.  For the size of the place they had an interesting selection of about 10 or so beers and we were informed that they infuse flavor into vodka there.    My group decided to start out with two different appetizers, both the black bean hummus and the brie.  They both came out looking good with the hummus a purplish color with olives, cucumber and pita on the side and the brie topped with a reddish looking sauce and a loaf of bread.  The reddish looking item proved to be the orange spices that were mentioned on the menu.  While the brie and bread were good, there was either too much orange spice or it was too strong as it tended to cover the delicate flavor of the cheese.  Unlike the brie the hummus turned out to be really good and was quickly devoured by our group.  For dinner I decided on having the Macaroni and Cheese.  It came out piping hot with a side of spinach.  The gooey baked cheese and pasta topped with some breadcrumbs was amazing and I quickly ate it.  I also enjoyed the spinach which seemed to be soaked in an apple vinegar cider but then again, I tend to like vinegar.  Another of my dining companions who ate the same meal did not care for the spinach and I could see why with such an acidic taste.  I was also able to try the ratatouille which consisted of some vegetables in a red sauce over top of spinach and polenta.  It was an interesting take on the dish but one that I enjoyed as the sauce was flavorful and the polenta had a good shape and had a nice consistency.     The bottom line for me is that I would head back to the Tin Front Café in the future if I am in the area.  It was a solid vegetarian meal and that I mostly enjoyed and I would see the mother (waitress) and son (cook) team do well."}
{"text":"I feel as if they could have a lot of potential. I  got the Bree cheese platter and it had a very awful taste to it. I also had the butternut squash lasagna. It was very good but you could tell it was not made that day and had to reheat it in the oven or micro wave. I would like to go back and try the brunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I just came from brunch at the Tin Front Cafe. I must be missing something because the food was 'not all that'. Kind of a 'yuppie' crowd. The one thing that stands out was the RUDENESS OF THE OWNER! After we ate we ventured into the shop next door that they own. We did not see the sign on the door that said \"ask permission to enter\" What? The owner was right behind us and slammed open the door because apparently in addition to asking permission to enter you are requested not to close the door behind you! She made it well known that she was irritated that we missed the sign.  We are both over 55 years old. Did she think we were going to steal something! I have never been treated like this upon entering an establishment! Not only was the food no good, the owner was rude beyond what I could imagine and she was older than we are! Never again!"}
{"text":"After a successful visit to Smoke Taqueria (directly across the street), we felt compelled to give Homestead another shot and visited Tin Front Cafe on 8th Ave in the heart of Homestead.  First impressions are important and Tin Front succeeded in providing a welcoming, bright, and fresh ambiance.  Very cool to see that the pieces of tin (from the roof) were repurposed to cover the front of bar and also doubled as eclectic wall sconces too!  We were seated shortly after walking in and presented with their lunch menu.  We sat near the kitchen service window and were fortunate enough to see many of the listings before ordering.  It was a cold day and the vegetarian chili sounded like a great way to start.  Even though it took a little longer than expected to come out of the kitchen, I'd say it was worth the wait!   A steaming bowl of hearty chili, loaded with veggies, topped with cheddar cheese, and a single slice of soft fresh bread.  (Might suggest Tin serve with a second piece of bread, considering the portion size). I would have been content with just this!  Onto the main event - we both ordered the grilled portobello sandwich.  The sandwich is served with a generous side of mixed greens and (what tastes to be) homemade dressing - very tasty!  The bread was toasted to perfection with just enough char for additional flavor.  All-in-all, a great venue and good value.  We'll plan to return, as there were other menu items that looked great!  AND they have a small outdoor patio and happy hour 5-7pm everyday ...  is it spring yet!?!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last month (just getting to the review now). Our great waitress told us the special was \"Brews and Fondue.\" Basically, you order a beer, you get a free fondue appetizer. Didn't have to tell me twice! I got the Imperial Pumpkin Ale and my sister got a nice sized glass of Pinot Grigio. Our fondue came out with a tea light to keep it warm which I thought was adorable. Our waitress also made sure we got extra bread for the fondue!  For dinner we split the portobella with corn risotto and squash with quinoa. Everything was great. The vegetables were fresh and seasoned nicely. My spinach was cooked perfectly. The place was quiet for a Friday night but I think if more people knew about it it would be more popular!  Total cost for free fondue, two beers, one glass of wine, and two entrees: $39. What a deal!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutly fantastic service! The people here were so friendly! Visiting Pittsburg from SC, and these people put southern hospitality to shame. Hehe :)"}
{"text":"I brought my family here for Saturday Brunch and enjoyed a great French Toast Sandwich. Service was a little slow, possibly unaccustomed to the larger group size, but very friendly and accommodating. I have to give 4 stars instead of 5 because the place turned out to be vegetarian, which i'm not opposed to but don't like to be surprised by. A few family members were a little disappointed to discover there would be no bacon at their breakfast. Inversely, a few other family members were pleased to find gluten-free options they could enjoy."}
{"text":"The menu was great! All vegetarian. They infuse their own vodka and the tea I had was delicious. Unfortunately everything our table of 6 ordered was under seasoned. We had ratatouille, kale and grits, butternut squash lasagna, black bean hummus, baked Brie and the beet risotto. Everything was almost really good but very underseasoned and lacking flavor. We had to ask for salt, pepper and hot sauce. The staff was very friendly and the prices were great however and I would return based on other reviews to see if it was just an off night. I also wish they had a printed out beer, wine and specialty cocktail list."}
{"text":"Wow. Oh, wow.   Upon stumbling into Tin Front Cafe on a Saturday morning, half asleep, sans coffee I seriously forgot what city I was in for a good 5 seconds. I rarely come to Homestead, and I can kick myself for not coming here earlier.  Classical music, eclectic artwork and tin sculptures, and a killer outdoor patio make this place a quiet oasis from noisy 8th street. There is a SF, kick back vibe that just gives you a hug and hands you a frothy Soy Cap, which was one of the best I have ever had. So.....now on to the food.  Magical frattata with goat cheese and fresh veggies- pepper and tomato. The use of real butter was a stand out here, and I appreciated the modest usage of it. I left with my belly full, but not to the point where I could not stand. What a great experience.  I will be back soooooon, with many hungry friends in tow. :)"}
{"text":"The butternut squash bisque was devine. My wife loved her quiche."}
{"text":"Stopped down for some breakfast - first time and definitely not the last.  I recently just stopped eating meat, so this was perfect.  There were so many delicious things to choose from on the menu.  I ordered the fried egg sandwich, which came on home made bread (light and crusty, delicious) with provolone and arugula and home fries (potatoes, a little spicy, but tasty).  My friend ordered the breakfast burrito which came stuffed with cheddar cheese, some type of chili and home fries.  She said that it was also a little spicy.    Our check came with chocolate covered coffee beans, how cute.  Can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner!   I agree with the other reviews, it does take a while before the food arrives.  There were only 2 other tables with people.  However, I think that goes with the feel of the cafe - more time to relax and shoot the breeze."}
{"text":"Great valentine's day spot! Vegan/vegetarian options and super fresh ingredients. My new favorite! The restaurant itself wasn't crowded at all, but there were people at the bar. Super nice for us, since we didn't want to be stuck in a crowded restaurant on February 14. The staff were really sweet and friendly, and they had a decent wine/beer/cocktail list. We ordered the black bean hummus, which was a very generous serving and it tasted freshly made. For entrees, m"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Homestead!  I've been meaning to stop in and try the Tin Front Cafe for a while now.   I finally got the opportunity tho sample their fresh and flavorful menu and will become a frequent visitor from now on.   Fresh ingredients with the perfect seasoning greeted me as I indulged in corn chowder on the patio.  I could have licked the bowl, it was that delicious.  My beet and goat cheese salad was light yet savory, which was perfect for a warm afternoon.   Washing my meal down with iced chi tea made it even more delightful.   Now that I have found my favorite vegetarian restaurant in the Burgh - Though the Tin Front Cafe can compete with any non-veggie restaurant in flavor!  I'm hungry for more."}
{"text":"Great food, simple with a complex twist to ingredients  Good location Nice patio space Excellent atmosphere"}
{"text":"Just an update.  The food here is still excellent and the staff has not changed.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and deliscious. The salads were fresh and tasty and the black bean hummus was perfectly seasoned (not too garlicky but full of flavor). The butternut squash lasagna was perfect and flavorfull and so yummy. The carrot ginger risotto was cooked perfectly and the carrots, onions, and ginger added wonderful flavor. Nothing was oversalted. The food came quickly, was super fresh, hot, and portions were perfect. The server was very friendly. The outdoor patio was lovley and the decor was charming. Also the cookies were yummy!"}
{"text":"What am incredible place. My dissertation advisor invited me to come saying it was one of his favorites. I can see why! Great vegetarian selections which were healthy but also tasty! I am not normally a coffee drinker but theirs was great! They also have a full bar with interesting infused vodkas, although I wasn't able to try one because it was brunch time... The owner of the Annex Cookery next door is a delight. The items she sells are very unique and well-designed. I will definitely return. Great to see business owners who are interested in investing in the redevelopment the Homestead community. The artwork is great too! Definitely a favorite..."}
{"text":"This place is a wonder hidden gem in what is often looked at as a rough area.   The Tin Front Cafe has a mix of awesome treats for everyone. It's an extremely cozy atmosphere with great staff."}
{"text":"Great lunch. I had a cup of chili and the black bean hummus sandwich. Tasted great, very good presentation. Sitting in the patio, which is in the back, I could not hear the traffic. I was able to park on the street right in front. I will back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Just hit the Tin Front for the first time.  Food was very good, Broccoli Frittata with crusted cheese was pretty amazing, Friend had the 4-Cheese Mac n Cheese and was happy as well.  We started with house salads, an arugula mix with cheese, cranberries and house balsamic - extremely fresh and tasty.  The bar is certainly extensive, although we opted for soft drinks.  There are a few tables out front and an adorable outdoor garden area that we chose, rain-be-damned, to occupy.  It was a very pleasant meal on a rainy Thursday night and we agreed that there is much on the menu left to explore!"}
{"text":"Another example of a comfortable, quality dinning establishment that happens to be on the other side of the tracks from the Waterfront. They have a one page menu catering exclusively to the vegetarian nitch. Don't get me wrong, I like a burger or steak just as much as the next guy. But I also enjoy carrots and tomatoes too every now and then.  Today, beings that it's been cold and rainy all day, I was in the mood for some chili and a beer. I stopped into the Tin Front and got a bowl of the Four Bean Chili. It took about five minutes from the time I ordered it to be placed in front of me. It was delicious and the Penn Dark Lager that I ordered complimented it well.   My only complaint with the chili was that the cheese (optional) that was on it was very stringy. I had to wrestle with it using a slice of bread on every spoonful. It became very annoying.   The only other thing I don't like about this place is the bar stools. They're too low for the bar and you feel like a little kid sitting there.  Those are only two minor knit-picks. Really, the place is an enjoyable establishment worth stopping for. The staff is super nice, the ambiance is subtly romantic and the small selection of beers are all quality. I also noticed how impeccably clean it's kept.  If you're in the mood for a meatless meal, give the Tin Front a try."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  We sat out on the patio, surrounded by metal art.  The food was wonderful.  The menu changes daily depending on what the chef has available fresh.  I had the mushroom cap with risotto and my friend had the four cheese Mac n cheese. The salads were fresh with excellent dressing.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This niche little restaurant in Homestead caters to the true vegetarian.  My husband had the Ratatouille and I had the Butternut Squash Lasagna - both were quite tasty.  The baked brie was a nice change for most appetizers however their bread needs a bit more substance.  They bake it themselves and it comes out perfect in every way but just needs a touch of something special - some character - to make it more thank just white/Italian bread.  Wine was disappointing.  I had their house Merlot - it was just eh.  Hubby had the Kenwood Chardonnay. I'd probably get a beer next time."}
{"text":"This is a cozy, tasty little joint in homestead with an all-vegetarian menu.  It has a lovely outdoor patio and a nice ambiance inside as well.  We ordered the risotto in a portobello mushroom cap and the broccoli & cheddar quiche.  The risotto dish was decent -- the mushroom and spinach were nicely cooked, but the risotto itself was lacking some body.  The quiche was delicious, with a perfectly buttery and crispy crust and a soft, cheesy filling.  All entrees come with a simple greens salad, dressed with a delicious balsamic vinaigrette.  All in all, nice value considering you get a salad, bread, and an actual entree \"side\" (e.g. parchment potatoes come with the quiche) when you order an entree.  Everything on the menu looked great, I look forward to trying more of it on a future visit.  The owner is very friendly and the service super attentive.  The drinks here, though, left us with something to be desired.  We had a bad experience with the vodka-infused cocktails on a previous visit.  They tasted imbalanced (one of them made my friend feel nauseous) and came in glasses with super bulky, thick stems.  There are no beers on draft but around a dozen bottled available -- the selection is OK."}
{"text":"Winter 2012 I organized a dinner at the Tin Front Cafe with my Meetup group, Pittsburgh Dining N' At, and it was truly one of the very BEST MEALS of my life! I had this butternut squash lasagna that was a slice of heaven on a plate! Super-delicious. They have a full bar, plus gourmet coffee drinks. In warmer weather, there is also outdoor seating in a back patio.   They have repurposed many materials from the old Chioto's Bar in Homestead, including the actual BAR TOP itself and the old tin roof! This gives the place a wonderful charm and local flavor. The restaurant's owners and staff went out of their way to accommodate our group, and the service was superb. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. Their food totally ROCKED MY WORLD!  Summer of 2013 I went to Tin Front Cafe with a friend and sat in the outside patio out back. The food, ambiance and service were wonderful. My friend's boyfriend is a vegetarian, and she was excited to bring him there sometime in the future.  Winter 2014 I went to Tin Front Cafe on a Saturday night in February. They were hosting a party, which was just ending. I think they were distracted by the party because I had to go and ask the waiter to take our order when we were ready, and my glorious butternut squash lasagna was nothing like I remembered on my previous visits. It was, dare I say it, MEDIOCRE! Where was my slice of heaven on a plate? I don't know what happened. Maybe they were distracted by the party, but it was disappointing. But, my friend really enjoyed her four-bean chili, and the black bean hummus was delicious, as usual. So, not a total loss.  My friend ordered a beer, but I decided to get a margarita. I noticed that it was extraordinarily SWEET! It was good, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so sweet. On the way out, I asked how it was made. I asked if they used freshly squeezed lime juice or some type of margarita mixer. They used a bottle of mixer. I asked to see the bottle, and let me tell you I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED to see that the second ingredient was HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP! The mixer also had ARTIFICIAL FOOD COLORING (blue) in it!   I was expecting better from a vegetarian restaurant. The waiter assured me that they don't use artificial food coloring in their food, ONLY THE MIXED DRINKS! Well, I'm a bit of a health nut, and I avoid artificial food coloring like the plague. If I had known they were using a cheap margarita mixer from a bottle, I most definitely would NOT have ordered that drink. I would have gotten a different drink or just a beer. For a restaurant that is known for serving healthful food, I expected better.   Two years ago, or last summer, I would have given Tin Front Cafe 5 stars. After Saturday night, I'm going down to three stars. My butternut squash lasagna was not very good this time, and the artificial food coloring and high fructose corn syrup in the margarita mixer were a bummer. Is it really that much more expensive to buy actual lime juice? I know fresh squeezed lime juice would really be expensive, but why can't they buy bottles of real lime juice or lime juice concentrate instead of cheap mixers with high fructose corn syrup and artificial food coloring? It would be nice to see all natural ingredients  in EVERYTHING, including the drinks, in a vegetarian restaurant that claims to be offering healthy cuisine. Maybe my expectations are too high. Sigh."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian cafe! Quite with a nice patio in the courtyard out back. It's a great place to take the kids for some delicate grilled cheeses, or your friends for a delicious dinner and drink. The owners of this, and the Annex Cookery, believe in the revitalization of their community of Homestead. --That right there is why you buy local, wherever your locale!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute gem - right in the middle of historic (albeit somewhat shop worn) Homestead.  The food is exceptional.  I travel extensively - all over the world actually - and what I have had at this restaurant is as good as I have had (indeed better) than many restaurants with long waiting lists for reservations and hype that extends a mile long.  The food is expertly seasoned, well presented and extraordinarily delicious.  Memorably delicious.  What's more, the family who owns this restaurant is expressing its values in placing this restaurant where it is, designing it as they have (using furniture and accessories from the area and from a by-gone time), and adding touches that typically are found in cafes located in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago... (sorry,  not typically Pittsburgh).  Run do not walk to this restaurant and celebrate good food, a wonderful community, and a exceptional family!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburg from out of town and had to find vegan food within walking distance of the Carnagie Music Hall and this was one of the 2 places that came up. I walked by it at first because it just looked like a coffee house but I came back and it has a full (small) menu and an AWESOME bar.  I got a delicious ratatouille that was made fresh by very nice people and a local microbrew stout while I waited for it.  They infuse their own vodka there and have drinks like apple pie martinis with fresh whipped cream on top."}
{"text":"Cozy, quirky little restaurant. It was very quiet the evening I stopped by, making the experience very intimate. I also had the best quiche I had ever eaten!!!!"}
{"text":"I drive past this cafe almost everyday, and I somehow never noticed it! My mom learned of the cafe through living social so we decided to dine here for lunch on a weekday.  We had a wonderful experience overall! The interior is very cute and the bar is beautiful. After a long time of deliberating because the entire menu looked delicious, we ordered our grilled portobello sandwiches and looked around in the cute little shop attached to the cafe while we were waiting for our food.  Before we knew it, our food was ready and the sandwiches did not disappoint! Although I loved what I ordered, next time I think I will have to try one of their salads.  They all sounded so fresh and tasty! Not only were the food, the service, and the atmosphere all on point, but the prices were also pretty reasonable for the quality.  I can't wait to try their dinner or brunch next!"}
{"text":"I've gone to the Tin Front Cafe a number of times for the Sunday brunch, and I have yet to be disappointed. This place is in the upper echelon of brunch spots in Pittsburgh. With the brunch you get a cooked-to-order entree and unlimited access to the buffet. The entrees are constantly changing - and the assemblage of offerings always includes a vegan option(s). It seems like an eternity before the entree arrives. I guess the chef is really into slow foods. I'm usually not too upset by the wait - I bide my time by filling up on the delectable buffet food. I kind of go ape over the vegan chocolate chip muffins - excellent vegetarian chili as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I like that the sides are self serve, (included salad, mini muffins and breads, chili, and potatoes + beverages). The entree I got was a burrito stuffed with beans, grits, kale, cheese, and an egg.  It was very good and I had a full meal out of my leftovers. There is a cute shop attached to this place also. The service was good and employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is one of my favorite in Pittsburgh. Small buffet with drinks, chili, salad, fruit, breads, etc. plus your entree for like $12. Annex Cookery kitchen shop (attached) is great for gifts. Service can be slow, but the Portlandia atmosphere makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's so cute and the owner is so friendly and sweet.   It's relaxed and casual, but still serves up excellent vegetarian fare and they have a full bar.  It's a great spot for weekend brunch or date night.  The backdoor patio is cozy with cool art and plants.   I've enjoyed every meal I've had there.  Veggie food represent!"}
{"text":"So here's what I like: Decor- It's artistic, eclectic and original. Staff- Friendly, eager to assist, upbeat and genuinely seem to love being there. Food- THE FOOD!! I adore the arugula salad (minus the pecans). It's fresh and full of flavor.  Fried egg with provolone and arugula sandwich may sound basic and it's a simple food but the taste explosion in my mouth is anything but basic. The way the cheese and warm egg mesh with that first bite is nothing short of delightful. Other foods that I dig- Apple and grilled cheddar cheese sandwich (probably my fave) and the pear/Swiss grilled sandwich=to die for!"}
{"text":"Seriously folks, I'm not messin' around when I say this is one of thee best meals I've had in the Burgh!  Forget that they're all vegetarian, forget that it could potentially be \"off the beaten path\" in Homestead, just remember to get your booty there fast!  Everything from the cute little ambiance (hello back courtyard in the spring!), the adorable owner and the scrumptious food... I just couldn't get enough!  To start I ordered the Pumpkin Martini.  When I think Pumpkin drink, I'm thinking creamy, but this was light but spicy and all around delicious with a cinnamon rim.  For an app we ordered the brie plate with fresh fruit on top and an ah-mazing loaf of bread that just HAD to be house made.  I really wanted to gobble the entire loaf down, the ENTIRE!  For dinner I ordered the risotto in a portabella cap on a bead of greens. This sounds like a simple dish, but it was anything but!  The risotto was creamy with a light texture of what I believe was cheddar and possibly parm cheese.  The cap was grilled to perfection.  But the greens...something you'd almost toss on as a garnish, were cooked to perfection with a delicious lemon garlic sauce.  WOW!  I almost wanted to as how they cooked it because I wanted to recreate it at home (even though I knew I probably couldn't, let's be honest!).    Everything.  Just... WOW!  Toss in the half off shots when the fire bells alarm and we had a magical evening at Tin Front.  Oh wait, add one extremely friendly owner and you've got an amazing restaurant.  I will most certainly be back...maybe like tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I thoroughly enjoyed it both times. It is all vegetarian, and they do it right. You can get a very hearty meal and forget that there is no meat! I have tried the butternut squash bisque in the past and it is quite good, but I saw someone else eating the chili and it looks phenomenal - I need to try it next time I'm there! Lasdt night I started with the arugula salad and had the risotto as my entrée. The arugula salad has pears, pecans, red pepper, and chevre, which is my mind is a perfect combination of ingredients. The risotto is served over a mushroom and comes with a side of spinach - I cleaned my plate! I also got to try the lasagna, which was out of this world.  They have a full bar and infuse their vodka with their own flavors - I had the chai-infused martini. It was a bit spicy than I expected and I definitely couldn't drink it regularly, but it was fun to try nonetheless."}
