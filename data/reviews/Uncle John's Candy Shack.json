{"text":"Had a very unpleasant experience at Uncle John's Candy Shack. Strolled in after getting some gelato up the street, thought the shop looked inviting. As I was looking at some candy, the man (I assume he was Uncle John) began yelling at a customer that had entered the store after me. He did not take into consideration the fact that there were young children in the store and used some profanity. In addition, he was rude to me afterwards when I asked about a certain product. Who thought that I'd receive one of the worst customer service experiences ever from a candy store's namesake? Safe to say that I will not be returning to this strange shop."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Not only can you find an amazing selection of treats from the UK but also a lot of nostalgic candy items. I love going here every once in awhile to stock up on Walker's crisps and Cadbury products that we can't seem to get in Canada.

The vibe is friendly and cozy - it's definitely a mom and pop style shop. While they offer the usual sweets that can be found at any convenience store, there's always something new and exciting!"}
{"text":"Uncle John's Candy Shack is somewhat small and narrow and full of colourful treats! There is a great selection of candy, cold beverages, grocery, and a nice British line of sweets.

They have the familiar candy stock that includes Nerds, Toffee, and Gummy Bears to name a few. The Cadbury chocolate bars came in plenty of sizes- from regular bar to something as big as an elephant meal! Also, the British line was rather interesting since they had both British sweets and baked goods. They had things like Nestles, Mars, Marks and Spencer, Tea Biscuits, Curly Wurly's, UK fudge, Iron Brew, Scottish Bread, Meat Pies etc. All imported from the UK. The only downfall about this place was that I was expecting more British imports, but found a larger selection of familiar treats I could really get anywhere.

The prices are reasonable, the store is organized well and the staff is kind and helpful. I would recommend Uncle John's Candy Shack especially if you're looking for some retro candy or some interesting British sweets or baked goods."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My family is from England, Ireland and Wales and when my Nana would make her annual trip to Canada, she would have her carry on bag stuffed with the good British sweets.  Nana passed away in August 1998, and my Dad more recently February 16th 2012.  Some people like to drink alcohol when they're upset, others use drugs.  I eat.  I had a field day the week my Dad died.  I think I must have helped Uncle John with his mortgage payments."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest shops on Mount Pleasant! They have a variety of candy, not just British kinds, and some crazy types that are fun to try. I've never had a bad experience here before and go pretty frequently. The staff, although I have only seen one older lady working there, she is very nice, always greets me and gives pleasant small talk when ringing me up. A cool place to go and check out if you're in the neighbourhood and a place you have to check out at least once if you live near by or just LOVE candy!"}
{"text":"The selection wasn't bad, and the store was clean .. 
However, the woman who was working behind the counter was having a long extremely obnoxious personal phone call. She 'greeted' me as if I was disturbing her. I had some questions (as I was trying to get sweets for my British mom) and she still didn't get off the phone, even as she was ringing me out she was STILL having her personal phone call. People say its rude to go up to the cash when you're on the phone, this was 100% more obnoxious. Sorry I disturbed you, saleslady."}
{"text":"This store is a little odd, but charming. (That's actually the same thing that I hope that people say about me behind my back.)   It's mostly a candy shop, with an emphasis on UK imports, and the selection is pretty big.  A lot of it is the typical \"Oh I haven't seen this since I was a kid\" stuff that you see in most nice candy shops, but I like the addition of the cool British stuff.

The reason that I said that the store was odd was that, in addition to candy, there are interesting UK-imported groceries such as jams and jellys.  Most out of place though is a cooler or freezer (I didn't look too closely) full of meat pies.  Also, the lady working there (today at least) could stand to be at least a little bit friendly - it is a candy store after all.  Still, a nice place to pop in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Staff seemed disinterested when I came in to purchase products. Didnt ask us any questions or ask if we needed help as we browsed. When I made purchases they still weren't very friendly and even though I smiled a lot, hoping to get one smile in return, I still did not. Quite frankly I felt like I was bothering her and that she would have rather spend time on her phone or reading a book.

When I asked if they had a specific product they said they did not and told me that maybe they might have in a month or so. I checked back in twice and they had an attitude every single time. I will never return.

No kindness."}
{"text":"There is really an Uncle John at Uncle John's Candy Shack! And I bet you that he is the most popular person at Mount Pleasant Village. 

Who does not love sweet and candies?! At least all the kids I know does.. and I do know a handful of sweet tooth Yelpers... (you know who you are?!!)

The decoration and colours used to deco the stores makes me feel like I am at the fairground... green and red and orange.. all bright and happy colours!

BTW, if you are into Great Britain sweets and grocery... Uncle John's does carries a good selections of British products!"}
