{"text":"We're here right now. Plenty of room still, and GREAT entertainment coming up soon for st. Paddy's day!"}
{"text":"Ordered crab cakes as an appetizer with wings and fish & chips as entrees (substitute Caesar salad for chips). Crab cakes were very good. Unfortunately the wings and fish & Caesar arrived at the same time. Wings were OK but fish was overcooked, tartar sauce bland & Caesar salad bland. 

Service was slow. My wife waited ages for a second glass of wine. First glass was dirty (evidently paint night residue). Server poured the wine from the dirty glass into a cleaner glass. 

Disappointing but at least had the fish & chips promoed"}
{"text":"The onion rings are delicious!!!!!! Beer selection could improve. Service was friendly without being obnoxious and very efficient. Best onion rings!!"}
{"text":"Their Truffle wings won Best Wings Calgary 2017 for a reason.  Staff are friendly and welcoming, ambiance is casual, screens everywhere so perfect for sports fans.  Love the weekly specials, when was the last time you saw a $3.25 beer?   Nice, safe local pub with an event bar upstairs.  Great space."}
{"text":"First time back since the demise of Nicastros. Had pizza and Jumbalaya. Both were great. Service and food were good. Hope they draw better than Nicastros.  Menu is much improved."}
{"text":"I only had wings and a brewski.  The wings were ok. I did tell the server they were \"ok\" and she was pleased with that. I'm ok with it as well. I was starving and usually almost anything tastes great when you've deprived yourself of food for 3 long hours. Alas, these wings were still \"ok\".
The beer was thirst quenching and the service good. Watching the Flames game is made comfortable and easy with the large screen televisions along the walls."}
{"text":"Amazing vibe.  This place has a great new menu.  Fun servers.  And they do fun things like paint night and video game night and date night.  This place is very clean and all around good folks wander in here regularly.   You can play darts, gamble and even book the entire upstairs for a party.    Keep it great nocs"}
