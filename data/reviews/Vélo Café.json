{"text":"The Velo Café is now a part of a French-inspired market which sells soap from Marseille, French cheeses, fresh fruits and vegetables. It's now my favourite café in the city!"}
{"text":"This is both a cycling group and a coffee shop. It is part of a market selling indépendant brand and organic product, as well as fresh produce."}
{"text":"Velo Cafe and the new Market on 17 with its French grocery is my go to place for lunch (sandwiches, soups and salsa) and coffee. Love their freshly baked baguettes.  And their duck rillette from the store - ooh las las. The Cafe itself is cool and urban. The prices are a little high but if you are looking for an urban French Cafe in the middle of Calgary - this is your place."}
{"text":"As mentioned by others, this is a small French inspired food market with a Café bar and sitting area.  The staff are friendly and the inside is quiet and comfortable.  They also have a tv in the Café sitting area where you can watch the cycle races.   A coffee is $2.40 and a Cappuccino is $3.50.   I will say the location isn't the most ideal. Especially for being marketed as a coffee stop for cyclists. It's on the corner of Crowchild and 17th. Two very busy not bike friendly roads. You'd have to manoeuvre through the residential roads to try and avoid traffic. There also isn't the most ideal places for bike parking either."}
{"text":"I have been here twice before l, both times for Lunch. I would have to say that this place hits it out of the park for breakfast.   Such a great atmosphere here, and such good food. The coffee was amazing and plentiful. Obviously a win."}
