{"text":"Hadn't been since this place reopened but went last night and it was really good (I'd have to say even better than I remember it from years ago).

GOOD:  They have a new patio which it great to sit at outside.  Drinks were very very good (had a mojito and caipirihna (sp)  both made with real lime juice and plenty of alcohol).  Food was good and not too expensive.

BAD:  They were busy and service was a bit slow but all the waitresses were working hard.  

PRICE:  50$ for two with drinks

OVERALL:  So glad this place reopened.  Really a great find- drinks are strong, tasty, and cheap and the food is really good too.  Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Went here last fall for our three year anniversary dinner.  The place is unpretentious when you first walk in, but the service and food were great.  I have traveled to Latin america several times and the dishes they served felt completely authentic. I particularly loved the plantains as an appetizer, the specialty mojitos, and flan for desert.
 
Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with strong drinks, lots of interesting food options, and reasonable prices.  Why was it so dead for lunch on Saturday?  (Answer not contained in this review b/c I honestly don't know the reason.)

There are many alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage options here.  I asked the waiter how sweet the jamaica was (for those who don't know, jamaica is a juice/tea made from hibiscus).  He said it was bitter, not sweet, and he doesn't really like it.  Despite his negative description, I took him up on his offer to bring me a sample.  It actually was sweet and too much like extra-strong cranberry juice, so I decided to go with the white sangria instead.  It too was incredibly strong - my mom got tipsy from one glass! - but tasty.  

The complimentary masa (bread?) with bean dip/sauce was a delicious start to the meal.  This unique dish let us know that we were in for something different.  

The shrimp ceviche was pretty good, although heavier-duty chips would have been helpful.  The Spicy Majarra (a fish) sandwich on ciabatta was interesting but it wasn't spicy as in hot.  I guess they were referring to whatever spice they used that kind of overpowered the whole thing.  The sandwich came with fried plantains that were the perfect blend of sweet and salt. 

Overall I give the place 4 stars because it has a great variety of Central American food and drinks, and a cool atmosphere, with tons of interesting local artwork on display.  There are many seating options, including an outdoor patio, loungey seats in the bar area, and a traditional dining room.  Check it out sometime -- no wait for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a central-American restaurant, a nice change of pace from the typical Mexican fare that dominates the restaurant landscape in America.

The food?  Artfully constructed...subtle and nuanced, beautiful flavors and textures.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and I love all of it.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Cleveland, and that says a lot, as Cleveland has an amazing array of good restaurants to choose from.  This place also has a variety of exciting and unusual drinks, both alcoholic and non, some of which can be difficult to find elsewhere.

La Tortilla Feliz is a must-visit for anyone who has not yet experienced this sort of cuisine, as well as for those who have and who want to see how it can be developed to its full potential.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant, with a striking (and amusing) mural of Latin-American revolutionaries covering one of the inside walls.  Ample parking is available in a large lot across the small side street next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"So this was my first time eating at La Tortilla Feliz, and what makes me sad is that it might be my last.  After a wonderful meal, our waiter mentioned that they are closing after December 31!  Great, just as I found a unique restaurant with good food, I find out it's closing soon.

I had an appetizer combo and while I wasn't too happy with the ceviche (too much lime/salt, overpowering the whole dish), the rest of the appetizers were wonderful.  I particularly loved the empanadas, tamal, and the arepa de reina pepiada.  I got the choose 7 combo, and the little appetizers were so filling that I was full after eating 5 of them.  

They also have agua frescas!  I absolutely love horchata, and it was pretty good here.

So please, frequent this place before they close!   They have great food at reasonable prices, with a really unique atmosphere.  

Dinner:
7 appetizer combo: $11
Horchata: $1.95"}

{"text":"Wonderfully prepared South American food.... it's well-presented and creative, and the flavors come from all over South and Central America.

Reasonably priced (entrees ~$13-15) and great service! My friend and I were the only people in the restaurant as they were closing, but they still waited on us attentively and with a smile.

My friend and I both loved it. Definitely going back."}
