{"text":"We have been waiting to try this new spot...first and foremost, nice atmosphere for a Saturday afternoon...our server was \"okay\", just not really attentive for a non busy place...which is why we  couldn't help notice the table across from us not clean through out our dinning experience.(which every server saw clearly because they looked at it, but refused to fix) Which remained the same until we left, unclean and disgusting, which we still took all in with a smile , but finally complained that our server sucked to another server, which was eager to tell our server. Lets just say our server handled it with \" true grace\"...needless to say, there is still \"one\" great server there, which was always getting our server or answering our questions, with a smile and energy....She constantly checked on her tables, with a smile and pure energy,\"wishing we sat in her area\", because it was seating yourself basis...We rubber necked for our server. And when she did finally come, it was us that was out of her way..."}
{"text":"Very nice layout! Beautiful patio on looking the Cubs spring training facilities. Soft yet welcoming decor with a slightly upscale menu with local prices! There is something for everyone. Whether having drinks before a movie or shopping at Walmart, I see no reason not to pop in and say Hi. Excellent and friendly staff and a Draft selection to meet anyone's taste. Gotta give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I almost want to lie and leave a bad review so this place will never get crowded but I need to give props to the people that own this place for having such a great and welcoming environment! We live close by and have found our gem! Stellar service, great food, awesome happy hour and super nice management! We ordered macaroni bites as our app (something that these kale lovers typically don't do) and LOVED IT! Spot on!! Best thing to happen to the area since the Cubs training facility opened its doors!"}
{"text":"Great selection on draught. Nice happy hour and weekend prices. Gourmet Burgers are out of this world! You have to try the appetizers. The first listed is the best. Tvs everywhere and easy to see. They have trivia as well. Owners did a great job with atmosphere and having friendly staff. We recommend this place to everyone! We bring friends, every chance we get."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a new restaurant in the area, but after reading the reviews, I was a bit hesitant.  Glad I went!  I ordered the build your own burger with waffle fries.  My friend and I ordered the appetizer fried pickles.  The food was really good.  I had been afraid my side of fries was going to be lacking, based on previous comments, but it was a good amount. The fried pickle was awesome. I really enjoyed my burger. My only complaint is that the grilled onions for my burger were red onion and not yellow (yellow tastes better). Service was attentive and courteous.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food.  A great place to watch a game, as happy hour extends to 7pm, which is great for those of us trying to sneak in after work.  You cannot go wrong with anything fried, the zucchini is my favorite.  Buffalo chicken wrap is also a winner. Looking forward to coming here for college basketball season.  Go Cats!"}
{"text":"Great place the people on here that say  other otherwise. I don't believe you been here a dozen times and never seen anything that has been said on here. Great food and great people!"}
{"text":"Wow, is this place great. Blessing made the night fun, got us involved with a bunch of fun other people. Try the chorizo burger, very Arizona, with your beer."}
{"text":"OK so I ordered a taco salad at a sports bar, foul on my part! But the word \"taco\" was involved so my expectations were high. It consisted of a overcooked shell full of \"dandelion\" lettuce and I paid $3 extra for chicken, a total of $10.00! No beans, rice, tomatoes, olives, onion or any of the wonderful things one would expect on a \"taco\" salad. I won't give up though! I'll come back but a burger will be in order!! 2 stars for cold beer and lots of TV's!"}
{"text":"Worst experience. I went with my parents. We got there at sat ourselves. There was only one server. The owner was there but was sitting behind the hostess stand and talking in her cellphone. It took 20 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order. It took another 20 minutes to get our drinks and our meal order was taken. I ordered a regular cheese burger my dad got a burger with hatch green chillies and my mom got a veggie burger. It took forever to get our food. When we finally got our food my burger was so spicy it was inedible. There were hatch green chillies in what was suppose to be a regular cheese burger.  The waiter said he'd order another burger for me but at that point we had been sitting and waiting  there for 2 1/2 hours. The server did. It offer to comp my meal even though I only ate what I could. He messed up the bill ticket and it was such a pain to get it fixed. The manager and server just didn't care at all. When I got home I immediately threw up everything that I ate. I will not be going back and neither will my parents."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for Monday night football!! Later than usual happy hour. Plus the chips, salsa and guacamole is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Three stars simply because it was just OK.  Not bad, not great.  We had burgers that we ordered medium but came well done.  Side portions of tots was small.  Food was just ok.  Service was ok too.  One positive note... Beer was ice cold.  My expectations were not high so this place didn't disappoint, but again it's just ok food."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm pretty impressed! Not the best burgers ever, but pretty decent! Apparently they are introducing a new menu, so it was suggested that we also get the pork tacos (so so good! The meat was really tender and juicy!) that we got both shared, and a side of tater tots sealed the deal!   Good happy hour specials as well, plenty of TVs to watch the game and really big space! This may be are next favorite local bar!   Tiana was the best waitress ever and was super attentive!   Will have to check out the karaoke on Wednesday nights and excited that they also have shuffle board! Big patio, which will be nice during the day and close to all the big stores and Mesa Riverview Park.   Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"The Burgers are pretty basic nothing to freak out over! I had the buffalo burger, a burger with buffalo sauce and ranch with lettuce tomato and onion. I asked for no tomatoes and they left them on and took of my lettuce so.. That's close? The waitress acted nice but also seemed like she didn't want to serve us. It wasn't bad just basic. Also we went at night and the music is extremely load with barley anyone here. My friend had the lis the toss burger, which has jalapeños pepper jack cheese and guac it also was just basic nothing special. Waffle Frys and the sweet potatoes Frys just felt like they went to Walmart and bought them from the frozen food section.   So it's just basic your not missing much, I'm sure if you want a country music playing sports place you would love it but doesn't seem Like a atmosphere them at would be fun for good sports games.   They do have a pool table and a pinball machine so that's cool. Anyway overall 2 star experience for meh food!"}
{"text":"Super douchey. Shitty service in an empty bar on a Tuesday.  hope this place closes so something better can move in."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Manager was very helpful. Loved the burgers, lots of TV's."}
{"text":"Sat for 10 min waiting for the only lady out of 4 other servers actually working. We felt like leaving until the only one working the whole floor and outside finally got to us. She was very nice and attentive, her name is Crystal Others servers were flirting with customers or friends right next to us, for a full 10 min which seems like a really long time when you are just sitting with no menu's. The Owner could take a lesson from Teakwood on Ray in  Chandler for how service should be, Because Your food is pretty good."}
{"text":"It was our first visit and we really enjoyed it.  Great food beer and service.  Our server Jonathan was patient and made useful suggestions.  - Get The Wings -  Good value - we will be back."}
{"text":"I like the bar, but the food and service could use help. Sometimes the service is great, often it is not. I think there were 3 or 4 servers last time I went in, but one of them seemed to be covering 75% of the tables. There are few healthy things on the menu. The salad I ordered was supposed to have romaine, but I'm pretty sure it was endive. The burgers are just ok. It costs $10.99 for a specialty burger, but if you just want a regular cheeseburger, you have to BYO (build your own) and that is $11.99. The wings seem to be BBQ for everything. If you want hot, they just add hot peppers to the BBQ sauce. I do have to say that the club wrap is awesome, though. Drink prices vary from visit to visit. I've been charged $6.00, 6.50, and 7.00 for the exact same drink on different visits. To top it all off, the music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to the others at your table. They will turn it down, if you ask, but it creeps back up again. I've given it 4 chances, but I think it will be a while before my 5th. Too bad. Nice place, poorly run.  PS: I had to come back and edit this after I read some of the other reviews. Someone else wrote that only one server out of 4 was actually working and her name was \"Crystal\". I found my receipt to see the name of the one that I mentioned was doing 75% of the work on my last visit, and it says \"Krystal.\" (I'm guessing this is the same person.)"}
{"text":"Great sports bar, lots of TVs, games and a fantastic bartender!  Menu is full of great food and apps and one of the best Happy Hours around"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon. . *not busy* ordered a Blt with an avocado it came out and  there was like a pound a bacon some lettuce and two tomatoes, one slice of avocado which they charged me a $1.99 extra for and another pound of butter on the bread. The bartender Destin was fine but paid to much attention to his phone rather than the bar also was not very friendly . I ordered a garden salad with my blt and he asked me 3 times before my salad came out what dressing I wanted. Got my salad and low and behold no dressing. So I had to flag his down again looking at his phone and asked for dressing and I had to tell him again for the 4th time. So I probl won't come back. Beer selection good, service not great or the food I had. I normally don't leave reviews but thus place is new and I was highly disappointed."}
{"text":"No Bueno. Worst burger I have ever had. This place needs help. Maybe the beer is OK skip the food and service is average at best. Two thumbs down for this joint."}
{"text":"I have been excited about this new spot by my house to open and tonight I decided to go out for some happy hour. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out since we just seen that they had recently opened. Well, first I really enjoyed the whole atmosphere of this place but the burger that we ordered was really disappointing. The service was kind of slow. My boyfriend an I decided to split their Kobe burger. The burger was $14 and it came with a skimpy side of fries. The burger meat was not even tasty, the aioli in the burger was also not good. My boyfriend and I felt as if the meat had been overcooked.   We also ordered an appetizer which came out as the same time as everything else. The jalapeño poppers were decent, your regular friend poppers as you would find anywhere else. We also got an order of wings, since we happen to love us some wings. They were crispy just as we asked for but their sauces were not that great. I believe my boyfriend ordered the house special sauced wings.  Next time I go in for a drink I'll have to stick to their appetizers, maybe try another type of sauce for the wings. Hopefully they can redeem them selves."}
{"text":"Hard to get someone to wait on you, sat at a table possibly 15, then finally asked someone waking past,do I go to the bar or how do I get service? The reply, yeah you can go to the bar,so as I am at the bar, they say, or I can take your order. No clear stations. No-one in a rush to serve you a drinks or food. The food was good. Not worth the money. Just unimpressed. I had to ask for the bill twice. So basically, not thinking I'd go back. The bar was not full enough to not be served or to have to wait 15 to 30 min per each request. The only selling point was a sweet man very friendly doing karaoke. He wanted me to stay more than the bar."}
{"text":"SLOW SLOW SLOW. Been wanting to try this place for a while and had a chance on a Saturday afternoon around lunch time. I guess the fact this is a sports bar on a Saturday  at lunchtime and it's half empty should have givin us pause. You are met with a sign that says sit anywhere so we picked a bar hightop. Our waiter came up gave us menus and asked for drinks. My wife asked if they had Stella on tap they did not so she asked what they have the waiter then grabbed a napkin holder from another table that had the list(stella was listed but hey stuff happens ) so we ordered our brew and from that point it went south. We order food and my wife ordered some sparking water (SELTZER) and lime for her beer 40 min later had not seen either. The waiter came by a few times to tell us it was comming bit no such luck  Eventually food came and you guesed it the  order was wrong. I ordered a philly the server (not our waiter) came with a burger. She did correct and my wife finally got her water  but it was  not my orginal order since I ordered sweet potato fries and got regular. I can go on and on but 2 hours is way to to long to take to be done with lunch. The food is good but not on my go back to list."}
{"text":"Awesome casual spot to get some drinks and watch some sports. The bartenders were great and friendly! There are a lot of regulars there, all nice. Good Neighborhood spot. Was visiting from Philadelphia and really enjoyed it here Went a couple of times during my stay. Good bar food."}
{"text":"This place is a joke... Walked in a lady said sit where you'd like. We proceeded to a table as she followed and told us she would be back with us in just a moment. We ended up sitting at a table for 20 minutes while she walked past numerous times and even looked directly at us... We ended up walking out before even getting menus or water.... I do not recommend going here..."}
{"text":"excellent place for local fun, food and trivia.  Great T.V.s for sports and many tables in and outside.  Pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, and arcade games. Wonderful Jalapeno angus burger."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks during happy hour overpriced food sticky tables that are dirty and blaring music which server stated  all sports bars have loud music won't ever go back"}
{"text":"First visit, went in with low expectations an was surprised by the good food and service. A step above some of the sports bar food that I have experienced. A good place right around the corner."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - Great sports bar Price - a little pricey on Burgers and they charge for a side of ranch on a $13 burger? c'mon Beer - $4 on select craft pints - Not bad Food - Burgers were definitely NOT cooked to order Bonus Food - They have waffle fries and potato skins! Service - pretty good"}
{"text":"Service was attentive, the food came quickly. I would say they have that part is down but my fries were only warm. Old maybe? Like they were not fresh and crispy tasting. Also, the burger was cooked great but the bun only covered the middle. By the third bite it seemed like the burger was falling out of the bun.   I just am a certain way about my burger experience. Again service was great. Our server, though covering a lot of tables for the bronco game that night, was super timely."}
{"text":"Great food I love the burgers and the wings! Plus they have happy hour Monday thru Friday from 11am till 7pm. Definitely worth a try despite others reviews."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a fluke and was pleasantly surprised!!  Food is yummy- I love hot wings but their \"naked wings\" are amazing!!!  Service is incredibly fast and the servers know how to take care of the customers without being intrusive.  The manager is absolutely the best- she remembered us when we came back and even took the time to sit n chat with us!!  Highly recommend this spot-- it's our new favorite!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday around 1:30. It wasn't busy at all. It took awhile to get our food. I ordered the Hatch green chili burger, medium well and my husband ordered the Reuben. The burger was more than well done. But still tasted ok once I removed the horrible day old tomatoes and the overly limp lettuce. (It's a burger joint! The toppings should be the freshest of fresh) $10.99 The house fries were really good. The Reuben tasted fine but the bread was not toasted and was very soggy.  Wouldn't order it again. The waffle fries looked like the bottom of the bag bits and pieces. Not whole fries.  Not sure if we will return. The atmosphere is great and lots of televisions."}
{"text":"Very happy to have a new place in the neighborhood. Great service, great crowd. My husband had the hatch green chile burger and was very happy with it. Actually had some heat. I just had fried zucchini but it was cooked perfectly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for a Birthday Party on Saturday night, the place was hoping. The service was quick and the food was great, the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that the patio was cold and they were out of propane for the heaters outside."}
{"text":"Great service and their food was awesome.   I really enjoyed their vibe.  It was very relaxed and fun. I am very happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great staff! Love this bar! Karaoke on Wednesday and food specials all week.."}
{"text":"Great place! The service was amazing!! The burger was so fresh and the pig-shanks are sooo nummy!! Can't wait to come back!! Great sound system and sports bar !"}
{"text":"Food was decent service not so much. Would we come back? Probably not. The bartender called my boyfriends order of water no ice demanding lol. Could be a place to stop for a beer before or after a cubs game...if you don't need quick, correct service. Service was below par on a slow night...less than 25% full...I can't imagine it during busy spring training hours."}
{"text":"Great place with lots of TVs.  Good sound quality during the game.  Beer amd drinks are cold and the food looks good.  We just had chips and salsa w/ guacamole but it was good.  Salsa had some spice amd flavor."}
{"text":"Great beer & great food! I had the wings & tried some of my dads burger & both were mouth watering. Also great pricing on beer & drinks, great for a broke college student. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I love their reverse happy hour and this spot is right down the street from my house. Daniel and the other staff are always friendly. Food menu on happy hour is a good selection of fried pickles and jalapeño poppers and much more!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I been to this place before for lunch and the service wasn't that great but we decided to give it another try. Unfortunately, we made the wrong choice. When we walked in we were greeted right away by the staff and was told we could sit anywhere. We found a spot to sit near the bar and waited to be helped. The place was pretty empty and not that busy. We waited for someone to come and take our order but no one came to our table. After waiting 5 mins or so we notice all of the waitress standing at the end of the bar eating and talking. WTH!!!  Since we only had a hour for our lunch and the staff didn't seem to concern in helping us we decided to leave and go somewhere else. As we were leaving they all said good bye and thanked us for coming in. We said nothing and walked out. As we were getting into our car the manager/owner came out and asked us what the problem was. I told her the service was poor and we only had an hour for our lunch. She apologized and asked for us to come back in and she would comp our meal. We declined since we had limited time. She then said that if we came back on a later date, she would comp our lunch. We said ok.  Since this was our second time to this establishment and we received the same service, I doubt we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Gave it one last shot yesterday and I'm done.  Last week I couldn't eat the philly cheese steak because it tasted like someone had taken the Morton salt and laid out a Tony Montana line on it and now I try the patty melt and it's got 5 times the salt it needs.  I choked it down because I hadn't eaten all day, but it was bad.  I even think they salted my fries before sending them out.  It's as if someone is purposely trying to sabotage this business.  I really had hoped this little joint would do well, but now I wish they would just let somebody that knows something about the food and beverage business take it over.  This place needs serious help."}
{"text":"I am 10000% sure this place won't be open in 6 months. The idiocy of buying 25+ huge flat screen TVs AND NOT PAYING FOR HIGH DEF is a death wish for the bar. That and their weird bartenders and unhappy happy hours means they never intended on making a profit. Guess it's (losing $) a tax write off for the owner."}
{"text":"This place is literally stupid. We were there for an hour and our food (burgers) still wasn't ready. How long does it make to make burgers and a salad??? We ended up leaving before we got our food because we couldn't wait anymore. Bad service and worse atmosphere."}
{"text":"We thought about trying something new and this was a bad plan. My bison burger was basically bathed in salt and my wife's burger was so uninspiring that it caused me to question beef. Save your dollars and sodium levels and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for lunch while I was in the area... normally I would sit at a bar but since my gf was with me, we sat at a high table so we could converse. We like the way it was decorated; the studio lighting in the ceiling gave a nice ambiance, and the serving staff was on point. Our server's name was Lesley, and as is our tradition when going to be a new place, we went with her favorite dish, which in this case was the Chipotle Turkey Club with Sweet Potato Fries. We got one as is for me, and one without bacon, because my GF is allergic to Pork. It was fantastic both ways! She really loved the avacado on it and I was a huge fan of the bacon she was missing out on. The sweet potato fries were really good by themselves, and the bourbon and coke I ordered was perfectly mixed. Lesley kept the drinks rolling without any delay, she was fast and friendly and seemed to be readily available when we needed her. She deserves 6 stars and a raise! The pricing for the food and drink was well decided by the management, and we left feeling we definitely got our money's worth!"}
{"text":"Slow service for a Friday afternoon, 2 burgers took 20 minutes. Waitress took our order and didn't come back until our food was ready. Had to go to the bar to get another beer. Burgers were over cooked, had no flavor and tasted like frozen patties were thrown on the grill."}
{"text":"Crystal is one of the only servers who seems to know what's going on.   She was excellent and really saved the night.   After seating ourselves, and waiting a long time for anyone to acknowledge that we were there, being blatantly ignored by the other servers who were chatting with each other and obviously their friends,  Crystal came and took our order got our drinks right away.  Our food came or super fast and she was quick with refills,  just like any good bar server should be.   When there was an issue with the tap,  she just poured from bottles to keep our service uninterrupted.  She is a class act and the other 12 year olds that work there could certainly learn from her.  Its a great neighborhood bar with good food but the other servers need to step up their game.  One excellent server does not a great bar make."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere...burgers are their specialty and they are NOT that special...no flavor We will try something else on their menu next time"}
{"text":"So good have to try waffle fries the bartender is awesome and very attentive will be back soon !!!"}
{"text":"This is now strike two in this place, I'm afraid. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. It is described as so:  Breaded chicken breast with our medium buffalo sauce, gorgonzola cheese and ranch dressing. Served on a fresh brioche roll with lettuce, tomato & onions.  ... it was nothing like the description. My sandwich came with a grilled piece of chicken and on basic white bread. Of course, I was already home eating it before unnoticed.."}
{"text":"45 min later and we still don't have our food... service is extremely slow and they are only maybe 25% full. I asked the host to turn the jukebox up after depositing money in my touch tunes app only to get a rude remark from her... that took all my strength to not go off on her since she was a young girl... I was called high maintenance from my waitress because I asked my burger to be made a specific way (I'm carb backloading). Cubs game will start in 20 min... we'll miss some of it I guess, so if your looking for a quick bite and beer. Go elsewhere. **** update.... food was pretty good. But for the service and the attitudes. I'd say go elsewhere. Gane started and we are barely leaving this place. I regret this decision."}
