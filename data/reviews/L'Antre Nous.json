{"text":"Les meilleures authentiques crêpes bretonnes! Nous y sommes allés plusieurs fois et ne sommes jamais déçus. Le service est chaleureux et efficace. L'ambiance est tout aussi chaleureuse et le décor champêtre font de ce restaurant un endroit invitant. Le menu est classique mais varié. On y utilise des produits locaux et de saison. Tout est préparé avec attention et amour. J'adore cet endroit!"}
{"text":"Great little place not far from the Ste-Dorothee mall. Amazing terrace where you would feel out of town. Their bretone crepes worth the trip to Laval of you are not a type of person that like to drive out of Montreal. Great also for business meetings or a date. Excellent place for Brunch on weekends"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant in our neighbourhood. Yummy crepes, bowls of hot chocolate, cappuccino. You can choose the fillings of crepes.  In the summer time, they have a terrace. Inside it is a bit small. Very few tables. Main language spoken is French. Menu is only in French.   They also host functions.   Reason for 4 stars: their table d-hote can be more expensive compare to if you pay for individual items. So, make sure to check that you do not end up paying more."}

{"text":"This is one of my kids favorite breakfast locations. Place is a little small but service is always good and food is always fresh and tasty. Summer time they also have all you can eat tartar at night which is really good."}
