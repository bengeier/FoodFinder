{"text":"Amazing! I asked the girl behind the counter to fill the bun with custard cream. It was absolutely delicious. Although I must warn the potential buyer that they put in a lot of cream... It seeped through the bag bug was definitely worth it. I finished it too quickly and didn't get the chance to savour this deliciousness."}
{"text":"came here the other day for pastries. they have the amazing cheesecakes and cannolis.  came back today to have lunch in the cafe area.  tried to order a sandwich but its not so simple. the set up was very confusing with no clear cut instructions. all i wanted was a sandwich for a fixed price which is what you would expect anywhere else. here, you have to go to the back and pick your bread and take it to the meat counter and choose your meat and then take it somewhere to get assembled??  was the $5 posted fee for assembling the sandwich? i have no clue as there werent clear instructions and didnt want to pay more than $10 for a simple turkey sandwich.  they shouldn't even offer sandwiches if they're going to make it this confusing and cumbersome for their customers.  so i deducted 2 stars as it was a very disappointing and frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, finally getting around to writing a review. I always come in get a few natas, some rolls, cheese, and maybe a few other deserts. Their bread is some of the best in the Mississauga, and well priced. Natas here are for me the best ones I've had in Mississauga out of the many Portuguese bakeries. A favorite is the cheese cake too -  big slices and price does not  break the bank.

Staff here are always nice and helpful."}
{"text":"To comment on one of the reviews, Nova doesn't even compare to this place. It's very inexpensive for the quality of products you get here. Even the deli section has better pricing than most stores. The cakes are very good, they also have flan which is great.  Try the blueberry cheesecake and the strawberry shortcake.  The only downside is the little bar where a few unsupervised but well behaved husbands sip on alcoholic drinks having loud conversations (Yes, \"Lazar\" is licensed in case you just decided to report them)... But trust me, as soon as you walk in, your eyes are involuntarily focused on all the cakes so you might not even notice the drinking husbands :) Love this place... But I'd like to have \"Lazar\"  all to myself! You don't really need to go there, you can go to \"Nova\". This place is mine! All mine!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice bakery in Mississauga City Centre. It is an Italian/Portuguese bakery. The bakery is pretty large and has dark wood decor. It has a cafe area in the front with a good amount of seating. In the back there is a hot table that usually has prepared pasta, rice, potatoes, chicken and seafood. They have a wall full of pastas, oils, olives, jarred items, sauces etc. They have a very good selection of pasteries, cakes, meats and cheeses. Breads are always fresh. I have tried the croissants, muffins and loaf cakes, don't get the loaf cake, I find them a bit dry. You can also get a bun of your choice and get a sandwich made in the deli section, which are always delicious. I definitely recommend this place for all the people that live in central Mississauga, this is a really spacious bakery, with nice decor and great selection."}
{"text":"I just bought a cake here for my birthday and it was amazing! This is probably going to be my go-to spot for cakes now! I was recommended here by my niece, and I am verrry HAPPY! :) It''s also pretty cheap for the amazing cakes you get.  I ordered a Strawberry Shortcake!

Definitely coming back here again...."}
{"text":"Well, this was my first time coming to this  place. First impression was that it has a homey feeling and reminded me some other Italian bakeries in GTA.

Sitting area is small but cozy. I had regular coffee and a palm pastry. Thee coffee was Colombian and was of descent quality. Re-fill is included.

I also looked different sections and purchased  a loaf of calabrese bread and Portuguese tarts.

While the, I interacted with few staff and they very helpful but and friendly.

At the cash, I got to know there is fee for credit card charge under $10 and debit card under $5. Frankly I do not like any fee attached to any method of payment.
I feel they are made up by the business itself. And that's for any
 explanation given.

So, as first time, my experience was overall positive. I think I will be going there more often. Will update future visits."}
{"text":"Great service, selection and delicious everything. This place magical. Pastries and bread made fresh, huge selection of deli meats. Hot food section very good. Big portions and ALL very reasonably priced. I've made this a regular place for my lunches."}
{"text":"I've been trying different bakeries in Mississauga and I can easily say that this place is the BEST in Mississauga. The selection of their fresh baked breads and pastries as well as their hot meals is awesome. Make sure you try their chicken and potatoes it's out of this world."}
{"text":"I come to this bakery mostly for the filet of sole dinner at the hot table. The sole itself is the best out of all the Portuguese places in central Mississauga, thick yet flaky and not overly battered. Rice n potatoes are ok at best, depends who makes it. Other nice selections include fried sardines and codfish patties
The bakery is more Portuguese than Italian. It's worth trying if you're in the area or if you work near square1 and want something different than the food court for a very fair price."}
{"text":"Great Portuguese Bakery
 There are tons of sweet on displayed apple strudels, cream buffs so much to choose from. There are also European bread and hot/cold sandwiches you can orderd. There are also seatings that you can relax and enjoy your food.

Can I have one custard tart.. Just one? Yes I can only afford to eat one... (I can eat 5 in one seating no problem!)

 The Custard tarts taste great...  the outside is really flaky.. not heavy has a lot of texture.

The filling is a little sweet.. but will taste great with a cup of strong coffee.

Yes the custard tarts looks burnt! Yes it is the way it supposed to be.. and it does not taste bitter or anything.

If you can put in a toaster oven for 1 minute before eating your tart.. that will taste so so so so awesome."}
{"text":"First time visitor at Lazar Bakery, I must say the most amazing Staff, Spent over an hour assisting on putting a wedding package of sweets together last minute, the customer service representative and owner was very patient and friendly, created an amazing design from scratch, must say this place will always be my favourite Bakery in GTA! The Sweets they have is heaven!"}
{"text":"Recently purchased Lazar's \"filled\" croissants and found that, what they're filled with, is mostly hot air. At $2 a pop, it's not much of a loss, but I'll stick to the other pastries."}
{"text":"I had an issue with a cake. It was wet and tasteless. It was 30 dollars and no guests were impressed. I brought it back the next day and told the owner. He and 4 workers took out forked to taste it.  They seemed to think it was fine and refused to refund the cost. But after 5 strangers take bites from it am I supposed to take it back? Lol 
Left without the cake and money. The male owner is a liability to that business. He wonders around the store looking like he is disgusted with the customers and he is of no help. 
I called a week later to speak to the female manager and she wasn't much help either. She said she would give me a refund but she's never had any complaints about the cake so it's so shocking and insane we didn't like it.  There was only one piece missing from the cake. It's was that terrible.  
It's a shame because it is a great bakery for most things. Just the customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"Come here for amazing pastries and cakes. We've bought birthday cakes here in the past. They are dense but very fluffy and the strawberries in the Strawberry shortcake are fresh. A little sweet which is typical of any cake, but they don't slather on the icing like others do which is good. 

They also sell many dry goods like pastas, oils, sauces, canned sardines and herring some I have never seen before."}
{"text":"I recently went to Lazar bakery for the first time about 2 weeks ago and I absolutely fell in love with the place. Lazar is a great place to sit with friends and family and enjoy a coffee with a pastry or sandwich. 

Lazar reminds me of the European cafes I used to go to in France when I was younger. They did a really good job to replicate the European look and feel.

They have a large selection of deli meat, cheeses and bread. I used to buy my sandwich buns at Starsky but as of 2 weeks ago, I've been getting them here. 
Always fresh and significantly cheaper.

I also tried their famous custard tarts and I am now officially addicted. Crispy on the outside and the custard in the middle is incredibly delicious.
(Definitely recommend their tarts).

Overall I am a huge fan of Lazar and I highly recommend you stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This bakery is very spacious and has a good atmosphere. Reasonable price and very good size/ portion. There are multiple sections within the store, for your Portuguese food needs. On the right-back corner, are the home cooked meal section, on the left are racks of all types of bread, and in the front is a deli and seating section where you can order a cup of espresso and sandwich of your choice. The middle has the mouth watering pastries, cheese and meat. It has a good selection of pastries, bread, cakes, buns and cheese. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm loving it! Great variety of pastries and a well stocked deli. Fresh breads to boot! Had their cheese cake which was fantastic. Excellent place to stop that is on a bike path/route. Found it during a MCAC ride. Takes Apple pay!"}
{"text":"Love their roasted potatoes as nice savoury meal. I'm a fan of their fluffy donuts, try any kind and I'm sure you'll love it."}
{"text":"It is a very good and a big bakery, with a small corner that has a hot table, I had tried their half chicken dinner with rice and salad, and it was pretty good

I used to buy deli meat, and breads from there a lot, but now I just don't go that way as much so not a regular anymore , but if you would like to try a Portuguese bakery with a very large and broad selection this would the place in Sauga

you can also dine in, they have an espresso bar and a huge bread selection as well.

ONE TIP- they have awesome sesame seed burger buns,   and of course most of the time it's sold out but worth a try"}
{"text":"Wonderful place - lots of options for baked goods cakes meats and cheese. The natas ARE THE BEST! I can literally eat a dozen by myself but then y'know you gotta watch your weight and stuff. Skip the grocery stores for cakes and go here instead."}
{"text":"One of the best bakeries in Mississauga. If you want FRESH this is the one.
Great place for a quick lunch. Just wish they did not run out of there fish dinners, it's so good."}
{"text":"Lazar is a spacious and clean bakery and deli with a sit down area that was surprisingly busy with people enjoying pastries, donuts and coffee at 9:30 am on a Friday.  I guess nobody is in a rush to get to work on a snowy Friday... well, neither was I :)

First things first, a quick summary: I tried an apple struddle. I'm a bit underwhelmed with the struddle, it wasn't as flaky as I like and is more expensive than other bakeries in the area, but it wasn't bad per se. The prices for pastries in general are a bit high, but they have a large selection of breads, pastries and desserts. The pastries and breads are fresh though, and the amount of people in here makes me think that the overall quality of food must be good so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

A bit more in depth:
I came in the back entrance, and the first thing I saw was the large selection of breads they had.  Raisin, corn, Caldense, Rye, Multigrain, they had a ton of selection of loafs and all were about $3.   They had a smaller selection of buns/rolls and a handful of bagels for $0.50 each. 

They also had a fairly large selection of pastries, croissants (plan, chocolate, almond), apple & cherry turnovers, struddles, donuts, churrios, assortment of tarts and other flaky pastries. These were all $2, which is more expensive than the other bakeries in the area (normally $1.25-$1.50 each).  I picked up an apple struddle and I'm sorry to say I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't particularly good. It wasn't too crisp and as flaky as I like my pastries, it was rather a bit softer. 

They also had a number of desserts (see my pics), cakes and tarts, cannoli ($2 for a large, I think $1.25 for a small).

The cheese and deli section was large, and I imagine this place has a lot of customers during lunch. 

Also a display of cakes which liked really good, each cake was about $30 I believe. 

All in all, if I'm looking for a pastry, of the bakeries I've tried in this area I'd prefer Nova Bakery which is about 5 minutes away: I had a better experience with their apple turnover and they have cheaper prices, but I'll have to go back to both shops for a more in depth comparison.  Lazar does have a bigger selection than Nova though."}
{"text":"The cheesecake here is delish.  Their breakfast goods also look very good except for the apple danish.  They smell amazing, but I tend to always feel the tenderness, softness and crispiness of a baked good by hitting it gently with tongs.  The apple danish seemed solid which is not good (imho), however, the croissants are huge and those look okay too.  

Gotta try some more stuff soon since I live just around the corner."}
{"text":"I prefer this place to meet up with friends cause it has enough options for all appetites. I tried custard and it's ok...not comparable with Custard you can have in Portugal. I want to try bread too and will go for it next time."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. Bakery has a great selection. Was helped by Alexandra. She was a true professional. Came in from DC to Toronto. Heading back to DC impressed. 

Absolutely love my dad's retirement mango cheesecake."}
{"text":"Lazar is an excellent Portuguese bakery/deli located in the Mississauga City Centre. Having lived in the area for over 17 years, I've been to the bakery too many times to count. They offer great options for pretty much any situation, so I'll just describe the things that make Lazar great.

1) Sandwiches: They also make fresh deli sandwiches, with nearly endless meat options. It's not explicitly stated, but to have a sandwich made for you, you pick up one of the fresh buns in the back of the bakery, bring it to the counter, and choose your meat(s). They'll serve the sandwich to you in their seating section, so you can watch TV while you wait.  

2) Desserts and baked goods: Try the traditional Portuguese tarts. The original custard is their classic, but I prefer the one drizzled and stuffed with white/milk chocolate. Their cakes and donuts are also among my favourites. 

3) Hot food: They have a hot food section in the back right corner of the bakery. They offer a rotation of Portuguese dishes, made fresh daily. 

4) Grocery store: It's more than just a bakery/deli - they also have a wide variety of Portuguese goods for sale.

My favourites:
Sandwiches: Prosciutto San Daniela, veal
Desserts and baked goods: chocolate custard tart, donut, mocha caramel cake
Hot food: shrimp patties"}
{"text":"This place has some really nice cakes and lunch meat - the cakes are fresh (not too sure about the meats) and they don't use too much unnecessary ingredients for their cakes - and best of all - it's across the street from my home.

Also, they are open until 8 or 9 on Saturday but I'm not sure why help says close at 6."}
{"text":"My go to cake place. It at a good location with lots of parking and plenty of choices to pick from. 

Portuguese shrimp patties at its finest are here in the back corner near the counter. Sometimes they put it behind the glass so just ask if you don't see them. 

They also have a large selection of coffee cakes, make your pick wisely they don't all taste the same. I get the normal default one. 

Staffs are friendly although some don't speak a word of english, just point and smile and they will do their best to help ya :) 

Recommended an will return."}
{"text":"Selection is great. Always fresh unless you go there later in the day. Nothing specific that I would mention but if you are having a \"I want some cake\" kind of moment, try this place out."}
{"text":"Amazing bakery and unbeatable food. Came here to grab some doughnuts and found these car tire-sized creations they called doughnuts. These things are huge and come in a variety of selections - glazed, sugar, chocolate drizzle, white chocolate, cream filled, etc. 

There are a variety of other things there that I will have to come back to try (like eclairs, croissants, tarts, as well as meats and cheeses. 

The doughnuts were amazing and the office guzzled them almost immediately. You can really taste how fresh they are. And the best part, each doughnut is only $1. I was shocked! These could easily be sold for $3 each and I would gladly pay it. 

Random side note: they accept debit and credit, but have minimum amounts for each ($10 for credit, can't remember what it was for debit)."}
{"text":"Love going here for breakfast on the weekends! Staff is always warm and welcoming.

The pastries are scrumptious and worth every calorie.

Don't forget to try the hot meals: my favourite is the chicken pie."}
{"text":"My friend posted on their facebook page and they immediately removed it. One comment of three was very favourable and they should have at least kept that one on. Their appetizer cod-fish has a fish-bone for a stick. The stick of this cod-fish was brittle inside of the fish. My friend mentioned that as with any stick albeit bone or wood (toothpick) one should be cautious. She also commented on how the bakery states they have other than; Portuguese products, to which my friend did not find many \"other\" nationality-products. She only noticed; sliced Provolone (cheese) as being their Italian product. The third & only positive comment my friend made is; \"the bakery has/had never before seen; HUGE Danish\". I have not visited this location but trusting my friend's experience; I never will. Mostly the deletion of warning consumers of the fish-bone, loses my respect for this bakery, indeed."}
{"text":"I've been going to this bakery for many years and it has only gotten better. Back in the day their sandwiches were always simple, fresh and good. 

More recently, my parents have really started to come here for their croissants, donuts and other fresh baked goods.  A huge fan of the Portuguese tarts. They border being slightly too sweet but they're such a good size that when you do reach that you're pretty much done. My parents come back here repeatedly for the donuts, which are huge and only $1 (!) and for the croissants which rival ones baked in French bakeries. 

In addition to the baked goods, they also have freshly made food like chicken, fish and rice. I'm a huge fan of the fish here. It was flavorful and from what I remember it was a good value. 

They also have a cafe sitting area where you can get coffee. 

Overall, this bakery has lots to offer and if you want a break from Tim Hortons then definitely come here for some great pastries, bread and food!"}
{"text":"Nice customer service. 
Beautiful display of the pastries in their glass counter. 

Tiramisu 3/5  
too much of cocoa powder on top. It was 3 cm thick lol. I chocked on the first bite as I didn't realise the cocoa powder was that much on the top. Had to scrape it off. Some part was moist inside some part of it were dry.

Chocolate caramel cheesecake 3/5  
Was ok for a cheesecake. The look was pretty. Wasn't that wow but still good to eat. 

Took some other pastries too but not up to my expectations. 
Up to you to try and make your own thoughts."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for more than 10 years and it still takes me back to the good old days! 

Great service when you can get their attention. When I need a cake on such short notice , I know I can count on this place. They will even personalize it for you if you ask. 

Their bread selection, pastries, coffee and other Portuguese products are readily available.

You have to try their egg tarts! They're absolutely tasty and a hit at every party! 

Cute little café!"}
{"text":"This bakery is fairly large and has an amazing selection of baked goods. There's a little cafe area when you walk in, and they even serve coffee and drinks. Their Portuguese tarts are to die for here!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for an amazing desert and coffee. Their sandwiches are also the best. But their bread and pastries are my fav."}
{"text":"friendly staff but can sometimes take a while to get attended to for behind counter items... oreo cheesecake is good here & DH loves their custard tarts & mini sausages....had much better butter & sweet bean tarts elsewhere in Mississauga.

never sat & ate at the little dining area...seems like too much hustle & bustle near the checkout to be enjoyable. I suppose I would if there weren't other dine in options...."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee, cakes, tarts, breads and food. I go with my family and they get what ever they like.  The Masa bread is so good, i always get that and custard tarts. There is a variety of Portuguese and Italian food. Cakes are fresh and food, worth the price. Almost everything is well priced. Its clean and the staff is courteous."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've been back a handful of times and have had a chance to try a few more items from their bakery:

Natas - Not too egg-y for those of you who don't like that taste in custard.  Pastry was nice and crispy!  I believe they were $1.10ec

Strawberry Shortcake/Chocolate Cake - Despite what one lady behind the counter said, Strawberry Shortcake wasn't the best and neither was the Chocolate Cake.  More cocoa taste as opposed to rich chocolate

Strawberry/Lemon Cheesecake - Pretty good and surprisingly light and not too sweet.  Apparently the Blueberry Cheesecake is the sweetest

Eclair - SKIP THIS!  Choux pastry was pretty dry which was a shame 'cause the custard - similar to what's inside a Boston Cream doughnut - was pretty fresh tasting.  Perhaps it's just a matter of storing them properly, re:  not in a refrigerated showcase.  I have no clue as to how you even make these ahead of time and actually get them to taste good

Meia de Leite (Portuguese latté) - Pretty good, definitely has a different, more roasted taste than the traditional Starbucks/Tim Hortons/McD's latté.

I find the staff always very cheerful and patient which does create a nice atmosphere and returning customers!"}
{"text":"To be honest I don't eat dessert very often but whenever I do, I generally only come here. I have tried all of the cheesecake slices and every single one of them is delicious! Similarly, with respect to customer service, I have had nothing but a positive experience; the cashiers always seem to be in a good mood unlike many bakery's. In fact, I once decided to sit down to eat my cake and almost immediately the cashier came over and offered me water, for a piece of cake that costs about $3, the gesture was quite nice!

Good quality desserts, an extremely fair price, and a kind staff, where else would somebody want to go?"}
{"text":"I have been at this deli & bakery multiple times and have practically tried everything they have there. It is definitely a hidden gem in Mississauga. 

I absolutely love the bread section at the back of the store. There's a whole variety of breads that you can choose from. The olive bread is a hit with my family, as well as the whole grain rye bread. Absolutely delicious. There's a slice machine at the back so you can definitely cut it on your own, but of course, the staff is always there to assist you if you run into any difficulties. 

The mini hot table next to the bread section is great. I absolutely LOVE their fish croquettes (don't remember the actual Portuguese name), but they are delicious ($~1.1 each). At the center of the bakery is their deli section and I often buy their deli meats when they are on sale. The staff there are very friendly and will do as you ask. However, when it comes to the different kinds of cakes and what goes in it, many of them are clueless. There are a wide selection of cakes for you to try and each individual small piece of cake is ~$2.50. There are also whole cakes available in the side turning glass door that is about $25.00 each. Their slices of cheesecake are delicious! Their mixed fruit cakes are delicious too! Lots of cream! 

In terms of pastries ($1.99 - $2.50), I think their custard tarts are okay. Not the best in Mississauga, but good enough. There isn't enough lemon-y flavour that I prefer and a little sweet for my taste ($1.50 each). There are other variations of it, one that is drizzled with chocolate and icing sugar on top). The other pastries are only mediocre. The danishes aren't anything special. 

The best part about this bakery is probably the cafe at the front of the bakery. There are 6-7 tables for people to chat over a cup of coffee. Make sure you purchase your drink at the cashier where you pay for the baked goods BEFORE proceeding to the barista to order your drink. The baristas are great and are friendly and you can definitely munch on your baked foods while you drink your espresso based drink. I have had their lattes and cappuccinos before and they were both okay. They also serve breakfast there, toast and eggs style. It can get busy during mid-morning!

New Hours Alert: They open daily from 6:30am to 9pm. There is always time to grab a snack and/or a coffee!"}
{"text":"Great place for cakes, bread and deli! 

They offer a variety of different cakes and other baked goods. You can purchase single slices of cake or whole cakes. You can also order custom cakes but it requires you to order in advance.  I usually get the strawberry cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake or the brownies. I also get their Portuguese egg/custard tarts; they are absolutely delicious but on the sweeter side. The crust is crispy and the custard is sweet and soft. 

As for the deli, the deli here is relatively cheaper than the ones you buy packaged. The deli is nicely separated into layers which makes it easier to make sandwiches later. Deli cutting service is sometimes slow as there are many people ordering. 

They also have fresh bread you can buy or you can ask them to make you sandwiches.

Definitely reccomended as thier cakes are delicious."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious Portuguese tarts, this bakery is the place to go. They also have a good variety of baked goods like cannolis, cheesecake, tiramisu, etc.

Staff is friendly and the bakery/restaurant has a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my number one bakery spot. There are bakeries everywhere around Square One but Lazar takes the cake. Their bread is amazing, full of flavour and I love getting a fresh cut to any size I want - the white bread with a thick cut makes excellent French toast. 

Then there's the cannoli's - HANDS DOWN - best cannoli you will ever have. You know they're fresh when the crust is crunchy, it makes more of a mess but the flavour is amazing. The ricotta cheese recipe is unmatched by any other bakery in my opinion making it impossible for me to leave without having just one. 

My regular items include: Bread, Sandwiches, Cannoli's and Espresso."}
{"text":"It's a staycation weekend for me. I decided to check in to a hotel close to my workplace, so that I can sleep in a bit on Monday morning before heading off to work. Free is always good!

I took my time heading westbound today. I decided to do a quick search on Yelp for Portuguese egg tarts and ended up driving another fifteen minutes to get here.

The bakery is located in a plaza. It's busy, but there is plenty of parking. I decided to park at the back and walk around, ultimately figuring out that there is a Popeye's and convenience store.

I walked into Lazar and was in heaven. When you first walk through the double doors, there are tables where you can sit down and the cashing out area. I was mesmerized by the dessert display smack in front of me. I am a huge fan of tiramisu. I must have stared at the huge slab for a good minute. I painfully decided not to get some today. I was on a mission to satisfy my craving for Portuguese egg tarts.

There are egg tarts everywhere on various racks on the right side of the store. You basically grab a white paper bag and stuff as many as you like in them. I got six of them. Each one is $1.20. There are also smaller ones. I would have to get three times as many smaller ones. Instead, I went with the regular-sized ones.

The far right corner of the store has warm dishes that you can either eat in the cafe or take out. I saw lots of fish and rice balls. I will need to try them out next time.

If you love olives (I'm not a huge fan), you have plenty of different ones to choose from. I liked the gelato flavours and sardines selection, as well as the tea assortment.

The woman helping me check out was friendly and personable. I paid and grabbed my valuable bag of egg tarts.

I had my first egg tart at the hotel, after I had checked in. The custard is smooth and perfect. It's slightly sweet, which it should be. It's also perfectly flaky and crispy on the outside. So good!

I have already had two. I may need to go back tomorrow for more at this rate and try the tiramisu."}
{"text":"I've been ordering my cakes here for more than 2 years already, and I don't plan on going elsewhere.  Their cakes are always fresh and delicious, not overly sweet.  I usually just get the strawberry shortcakes as I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate cakes, but I've been told that strawberry is their specialty anyways.  Also, the pricing is really cheap if you compare it to the size of cake you're getting; I never have to pay more than $30 for a good medium-large sized cake.  Overall, really great cakes, and I plan to try their other pastries next time!"}
{"text":"Went here to buy a cake and left with far more! All the cakes, breads, and pastries are so fresh and delicious. Also the fact it's a cafe as well us a bonus. Will definitely be back. 

Value 5/5
Taste 5/5
Overall 5/5"}
{"text":"my neighbourhood spot. i walk here even in snow storms. Full deli & dessert bar with a very decent selection with all the common european goodies.... fresh bread comes out constantly throughout the day along with a hot food stand & full café bar. The ladies work very hard and they are always very fast and friendly! 

They also have a section of dried foods on the shelves that don't get much attention. I think that area could use a little sprucing up make it a little more exciting."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this cafe on my drive and decided to stop in to pick up some buns - I ended up walking out with a lot more!

This decent sized space serves as an excellent bakery and a little cafe.  I did not order anything from the cafe so I cannot comment on that aspect of this business, but it was definitely packed and lively in there.  

The bakery is full of beautiful, colorful desserts which are all decent priced. A square piece of cake, brownie or cheesecake is about $2.50. Their cinnamon buns are HUGE and will run you about $2. Everything in there appeared very fresh and the place smelled heavenly. Buns were fresh and fairly priced!  

They have a good amount of staff working so you are not waiting very long to be assisted.

All in all,  it was a great experience and great food. I definitely will be back and will make it my regular bakery stop from now on!"}
{"text":"I have  come over the years to try  various pastries , breads and cakes.  Two items have stood out and I always return  for those. First are the  yellow Portuguese Tarts.  They   are sweet with a hint of egg and are the best Portuguese  tarts I have eaten. Second is the olive bread which is very soft and goes well with avocado spreads , honey or butter . 
If you make a visit here I would recommend pairing  your purchase with the tarts .
I plan to try some of their chicken and fish items on my next  visit  and  some tarts as well . :)"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often to buy their sliced deli. They have a huge variety or deli ranging from beef, chicken and pork. They also have a lot of options for cheese. 
You are also able to order deli sandwiches. They are made to your liking. You can add whatever you like to them such as lettuce, cheese and etc. 

The bakery also has fresh bread and cakes. Their strawberry cheesecakes are really good. So are their egg tarts, a little too sweet but still very tasty."}
{"text":"Great selection of European buns, meats and cheeses. I've never tried the coffee but I always see elderly people enjoying a nice cup whenever I pop by. Bread is always fresh and they will cut loaves for you, and you can choose the thickness. They also have a hot food bar section, not sure how much those costs though. 
I've never been disappointed with their cakes whenever I get a little sugar craving. The sweets are  satisfying for their price too! You can even custom order cakes for your various occasions. Thy also have a variety of European goods sold on the shelves around the perimeter of the store, I've never bought any so I'm not sure what it's about. 

The staff are friendly and are more than willing to help explain what things are if you're not familiar with them."}
{"text":"Their website is a little dingy, so I called in order to get information on cake prices & such. The first time I called, they were extremely busy and asked me to call back in 20 minutes. I was slightly frustrated, but I know that it is a fantastic bakery and understand why they had asked me to call back in a bit.
Once I called back, the customer service was amazing! The woman on the phone was extremely nice & we completely my order in no time. (:"}
{"text":"Great place this Portuguese bakery. Love the little cafe part in the front to have your latte and snack. Large selection of fresh bread. The pretzel like twists in the back section are worth trying. They go well with antipasto. Great deli selection too. Staff is always friendly. I love the baked sweets too. Most items are good and definitely worth a try. The walnut tarts and coconut tarts are great! I drive from North Mississauga to come to this place. Check it out."}
