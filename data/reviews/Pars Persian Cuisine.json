{"text":"Both food and service were excellent.  I had the grilled mushrooms. It was paired with very tasty rice with dates. After we were seated, they immediately served us worm pita with onion and butter. My nine year old loved that."}
{"text":"What a gift to have around the corner!

I agree with one of the previous reviewers....from the outside it doesnt look like anything special.  But the inside is wonderfully appointed with tasteful furnishing and artwork.  Tranquil and peaceful.  The bar too is unassuming yet refined and classy.

The waitstaff is all wonderful.  You'll feel like you've been transported to another state of mind where customer service is once again important.  The guys are great!  Such professional courtesy.  

The menu is great.  They have pictures for people so that they know what they are ordering, yet the staff is eager to offer suggestions.  Everything is a speciality.  They have 7 or 8 different types of specialty rices.  The lamb shank is incredible as are all the kabobs and the kebodah!  

No matter what you order, they bring out the softest, fresh hot pita with butter and raw onions.  May sound like a strange combo, but you won't feel that way after trying it.  

And no matter how awesome your meal is (and I promise you will be shocked at how great it tastes) I challenge you to find a way to finish it all.  The portions are wonderfully huge and your mouth will be watering the next day waiting for lunch to arrive so you can finish it.  

Best of all...despite the fact that this feels like a \"Saturday night special place\", its affordable enough to enjoy any night of the week almost.  Especially because most of you will get two meals out of it!!!

I have learned to love The Persian Room also.  But PARS is so much classier...so much more romantic...so much more \"approachable\" for those of us not from the middle east.  And the food is better here too.  

Gotta check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Actually we ended up here because it used to be a sushi place that my friend was fond of but hadn't been to in a while.  Lo and behold, it closed and turned into Pars...we were hungry and too lazy to drive somewhere else, so we ended up eating here.

The decor has a Persian flair, but you can still see elements of it being a Japanese place (the sushi bar is still there)

They give you a weird amuse bouche of pita bread and raw onions...weird, but I'm a fan of both and together it was oddly good.  We were ready to order an entree each. but the waiter (I think the owner) suggested we get one of their combo platters and split it (we were 3 people).  We got the shish kabob platter ($29) which came with lamb, chicken and koobideh, rice and salad.  PLENTY of food for all 3 of us, including some to take home.  The meat was all expertly spiced and cooked, and the rice was out of this world.  The waiter (again, I think owner) was very attentive to us and the other diners.

All in all, a very enjoyable meal...great food and great service.  The waiter (once again, the owner)  suggested we spend a lot less there at his own expense...you don't see that often.  

Oh yeah, they have a full bar...

easily 5 stars"}
{"text":"Just went here, please do not judge Persian food in this restaurant, the tadig was old and very hard to chew, he replaced our tadig with another same old hard to chew tadig. He over charges, make sure you read the entire menu for suprise charges. The owner seems to have no knowledge of restaurant etiquette. We order chicken soltani and they brought beef and said there is no chicken koobedeh. The beef koobideh has an odd taste... The restaurant was dead I should have known. I do not recommend this place, as a Persian I am embarrassed it is called Persian. The owner seemed extremely arrogant and I hope he leaves the restaurant industry..."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time last Saturday and placed a to go order. the food was just ok and with no flavor. I see so many comment about how good their food is, but I have a feeling most individuals never had any real Persian food so they think this is how it should taste. Don't be fooled by a fancy website, picture with a local senator or overpriced food. you have so many better options in the city and if you don't mind driving, this place should be at the bottom of your list. What really bothers me the most is being taken advantage of and i feel that s what happened here.
We order an Appetizer platter and only thing that was made at the restaurant was the Olivieh Salad and the shirazi salad because they cant buy it on the market. they served canned Dolmeh (stuff Grape leaves) Trust me they were canned, jar pickled  and store bought hummus. what a joke......and you sell them to public as \" Persian pickles\" but made by Vlasic?  I'm a native my self, but would never take any of my friends and family to this place....."}
{"text":"I almost gave three stars but settled on four because I really like the food and atmosphere.  The restaurant is quaint and enjoyable.  What I don't like here is the deceptive practices At lunch they ask if you want all rice or half a salad. They do not say this is a $2-3 up charge.  Also if you visit on a holiday that falls on a weekday, there open for lunch but you pay dinner prices."}
{"text":"I really like Pars but I have been there a few times now. Their gheimeh, gheimeh bademjan and lamb shank are nothing short of delicious and I love their bread. The restaurant is a bit on the pricier side but the portions are large and enough for a dinner the following day too. The waiter was great and very genuine and friendly. We will certainly make Pars a regular stop in the future."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place personally it's the best! I love how when you get it to go and they get it ready in 10 minutes, I also love the employees there so kind:):)"}
{"text":"Another great visit! We were in the area again, and decided to revisit the restaurant after our last great experience. Once again, the Kubbideh was outstanding.  And there is so much food, that you can actually share one order. So the prices seem high, but not considering two of you can share an entr√©e. We also got an eggplant appetizer that was excellent. Server was super super nice- would highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"A friend and I were at Pars last night for the first time.  I have never had Persian food before, But I am Greek.  Some foods are very close in taste, such as the stuffed grape leaves with rice...have to say that is the best I've ever had (don't tell my mom lol).  the staff were very pleasant and friendly.  Our waitress suggested a combination appetizer which had the stuffed grape leaves and 3 different types of dips; hummus and one that was very simular to tzatziki which was very good. the app. was good but too much food or we have too little restraint as I could barely eat alittle  of my main course.  I have to say, some of the best pita bread I have had was here!....hot and fresh from the kitchen..My friend had the lamb and I had a vegetarian dish with marinated mushrooms and rice with lentils and currants.  I expected heavily seasoned food for some reason....which it was not.  the taste was amazingly mild but perfect in flavor and spice.  My friends lamb did have a sauce that was seemed like a red curry which he said was just perfect.

I will go again when I have the craving.  This restaurant isn't close to my neighborhood but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We were the only ones in the restaurant around lunch time on a Saturday. The service was slow and the food was below average at best. Will not go back. I would rather go to Persian room. I was charged $7 for a side salad that was basically a small plate of iceberg lettuce and a slice of  cucumber."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant's food but the service is so slow due to never having enough employees (7+ years)
No better way to NOT create loyal customers. 
There are 2 tables today and had to ask twice for more bread.  Very disappointing.  

Please staff appropriately and your business would increase 50%!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Pars. Ate on the patio which is very nice and private. We shared the Hummas for a starter which was very good. The pita served was delicious. This was followed by a very large entre. I had the salmon with a salad and rice and my wife had a chicken meal. They both were delicious and far more than we needed to fill us up.

The server was excellent. We eat slowly and we were not rushed at all. We found this jem on Yelp and we will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"So happy to find a quality, family led restaurant among so many chains. Had the lamb shank which was amazing, came with beautiful spiced rice. Only drawback is that the meal was very salty, which could have been avoided. But top service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, lovely spices, friendly service. The food is original and exotic.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop when we come to town. They have the best dolmeh we've ever had, anywhere. The service has been great everytime we've gone."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Pars twice for big family events and it has been perfect both times. The portions are generous in size and the food tastes great. Also the food was packed and ready on time and everything was very organized. The owner and employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a this place so I ordered a takeout lunch of the lamb kabob. When I got back to my work I realized I got a box of lettuce and rice and three bite-size pieces of lamb. Definitely not worth the $15 I paid. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"I have been at Pars a number of times , I have brought a lot of people including visitors and locals to taste their amazing food.
The food is fresh And awesome but.....

Let me just start with being the service industry and I always give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt.....

But, this last time we had an absolutely horrible waitress who acted like she didn't want to be there , didn't check up on us , was never around , and messed up our order. I never felt like I was a \" nuisance\" in a restaurant. 

In the past I would give this place a 5! 

Unfortunately not this time , the wait staff was terrible."}
{"text":"Good Persian food with a courteous staff. Nice to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first experience with Persian cuisine was Pars a few years back. Since then, I have been hooked, though Pars has been the best of the bunch. The food here is excellent, and the menu is very large. The staff is very friendly and always attentive.

Here is a sample dinner that I would recommend for 2 people.
-Start with hummus, it comes with fresh warm pita, and is delicious
-Order the chefs combination platter. It comes with filet, koobideh kebab (ground beef with onion and spices), and chicken filet. When ordered for 2, it comes with 2 large plates of rice and 2 grilled tomatoes
-The persian ice cream is worth it alone to come here. It is huge and more than enough to share. Writing this review makes it hard for me not to think about wanting some right now...

If you have never had Persian before, the staff is very friendly and patient, and will help you find something for your pallet."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I had lunch at Pars today with a business associate who had never tried Persian food. We ordered the tadig (crispy golden rice from the bottom of the pot) with gormeh sabzi (parsley, beef, red bean stew) and gehmi (yellow split pea stew) and it was excellent, as always. The tadig is a favorite of my family so I always order it when I take friends.

For lunch, I had Zeresk polo (barberry rice and chicken) and it was amazing, the sauce on the chicken was very good and the rice was the best! My friend had basmati rice and white meat chicken kabob - a very good choice for someone new to Persian cuisine.

The service is excellent, and the food is consistently outstanding. By far, Pars is the best Persian Restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant I ever been to food wise, the only good thing about it is you would appreciate good food at good restaurants. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Food adventure stop #23? - Persian food!

Was invited by a girl friend to try this place as my first Persian food experience, recommended by her as she has been a fan of this place, and just by one visit, i became a fan!

We enjoyed a shared plate of grilled lamb, chicken and veggie kabobs, complimented with two different kinds of rice, one with dates and beans, the other was with saffron if i remembered it correctly. The kabob was tasty with the unique Persian seasoning I suppose, though not overly salted or spiced, the flavor was more on the mild side, which was good for us :) We both liked the rice with dates in it, the little sweetness really balanced well with the food. 

I look forward going back for some more of its menu!"}
{"text":"I lived in LA for 5 years and when I first moved there I had an extremely limited palette.  I decided to live a little and after sampling food from all sorts of regions, I grew to love Persian food.   My old boss that I had there was Iranian, as was the vice-president of the company, so I gladly and happily feasted on Persian food quite often.  When I moved back to Arizona, I was really hesitant to try some of the Persian restaurants out here for fear of disappointment. 

My fiance and I checked for reviews for the restaurants out here and decided to try Pars first.  We were over-joyed that we made this our first choice!  My fiance had never had Persian food before and he fell in love with it after our first trip.  

The chicken and filet were both cooked to perfection with just enough spice to make you drool.  The rice was plentiful and properly seasoned.  The salads were fresh and lovely. All in all, such a great meal.  

We've gone back several times since!"}
{"text":"Have had their Chicken Filet Sultani (comes with one set of chicken and a second of koobideh) and their Gormeh Sabzi.

The portions are fairly large, which is nice.
The meals have a reasonable amount of flavor, comparable to Persian cuisine I've had in other parts of the country.
The koobideh was delicious, as was the Gormeh Sabzi.
The chicken filet (aka marinated boneless white meat chicken) kabob can be hit or miss. One time it was decent. On a second visit, the quality of the meat was poor (quite fatty) and about half of it was inedible. I've found this is often the case with chicken kabob regardless of restaurant, but that still doesn't excuse it.
The rice portion was good on both visits. It was of perfect consistency (soft, fluffy, hot).
The salad that comes as part of the lunch meals was well made and the amount of dressing included was perfect.

The waiter was very polite and accommodating.

For those who look to eat Gluten Free, beware that they are not very proactive with this. You have to ask the waiter in order for him to tell you that, for example, the bread they bring you is -NOT- gluten free. 
While the waiter will tell you this if you ask, the other help that brings out the water and the bread does not seem to be aware of this fact and I observed them tell a guest that asked, that yes, the bread was gluten free. (As soon as the help walked away, I let that party know before they ate it that it's not actually gluten free.)

Anyway, overall I plan to continue to come back, and the lunch portion and pricing seems to be the best combination (as of this writing, they only offer that menu on weekdays during specific hours). The dinner menu pricing, in effect even at lunchtime on weekends, is a fair bit more expensive for essentially the same nice large portion of food.

On both visits (one a weekday during lunchtime, the other a Saturday during lunchtime) there were a handful of other parties present, so they are doing some business, but there was no wait or need for reservations. Not sure if that might change at dinnertime."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Been going to Pars for a few years now and the food is great.  We purchased a to go order for 5 people for $110. They gave us only two soggy pitas and when I called to complain, the manager (Tina) told me that we only bought two meals and that we are only entitle to two pitas.  I realize that I am only citing one customer issue but they have become very stingy with basic items and charge $1 for each additional pita. When we eat in, they offer us pitas through the meal and are more reasonable. I told the manager I was disappointed with our meal and she said that \"It's policy\".  They have also asked us to leave when our child acted up and we were one of two families eating there. They are not family friendly and clearly do not care about the customer."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The mahi mahi kabob and zaresch rice with barberries was incredibly good.  My friend had the lamb shank which fell off the bone and was truly yummy. What other yelpers did not mention was the very large portions for dinner!  I could have easily shared my dinner.  Instead got to have delicious leftovers the next day.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Persian for 200 miles! The food was incredible and the service was small but a force to be reckoned with! I had the lamb shank and rice and it literally melted in my mouth! Great restaurant and I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was terrible. We were with another couple and we had made a reservation the previous day. When we arrived, we had to wait to check in and when someone (the owner) finally came to the front, we were told that our name was not on the list. This was a busy Saturday night and we would have to wait 3 hours for a table.  We were offered a table outside on their patio with no wait. Unfortunately, it was a cold night, only in the high 40's and their heaters gave very little comfort and warmth. One heater worked better than the other, but only if you sat directly under it. We were freezing!  To make matters worse, we seemed to have been mostly forgotten out there. Extremely slow and terrible service. Our waiter was very friendly but the restaurant was clearly under staffed. We felt that the owner was not very accommodating. It took quite a long time for us to be served our food. We noticed some tables inside - who arrived after us - being served before our food was brought out. Our friends ordered the lamb shish kabob medium rare and it was served well done but our food was very good. We asked for more pita bread several times and we did not receive it until near the end of our meal. We also asked for more hot tea (to stay warm) and it too, was not brought out until near the end of our meal. 

When the tables inside started to clear out, we asked if we could please eat our dessert inside where it was warmer. The ice cream was excellent. There was a large party that was finishing up and they were letting their 3 kids run wild throughout the restaurant. We couldn't hear each speak over the screaming kids so that's when we decided to leave. 

We were excited to try this place after reading such good reviews and seeing it on Check Please Arizona. We left feeling so profoundly disappointed. The food was good, but our experience is preventing us from ever wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Pars serves the best chicken kebabs and basmati rice! Very reasonable prices considering how much food you get.

My friend and I were being adventurous recently so tried their saffron ice cream.  I'm usually just a coffee ice cream person but this ice cream was one of the best I've eaten.  It is home-made, very creamy.  On par with Lapperts Ice Cream of Kauai."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines Day this year and everything was fantastic. They looked super busy but the service was good and the food tasted great. I love the ice cream! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, loved it! It was served family style so our group of 7 got to sample all kinds of yummy goodness. I brought home a menu so I could accurately describe what we enjoyed.

As we were seated, I was fascinated by the art hanging above our table. It had so much texture and color, but I couldn't tell what it was. The restaurant owner, Masoud, explained that it is a Persian rug that took 4 years to make. There were several others around the restaurant that were equally beautiful. Dinner at an art gallery? I love it.

Now on to the food. Next time we go, we're ordering:
* Maust' Khiar and Maust' Moosier($5.50, $6) yogurt dips w/grilled pita. So creamy and flavorful. I would be content with that as a meal.
*Chef's Special - it's $30 and could easily serve 3. It is the combination plate with Barq (filet mignon), juicy chicken filet, and the koobideh (kinda like meatballs), basmati rice and grilled tomatoes.
*Dessert! I don't usually like baklava, but this has changed me. It wasn't too sweet or goopy. Lots of flavor. The other \"must repeat\" is their ice cream. It's yellow in color, but pistachio, honey and saffron in flavor. Mmm mmm, good."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. My wife and I love Pars the people are friendly and the service is great. You are going to pay some $$ but the food/dessert is worth it \" you get what you pay for\" try the red wine \"tree of life\" very good! The restaurant is a big supporter of the military..owner is a good man:)"}
{"text":"A small restaurant tucked inside a plaza area well worth a visit. At first glance the outside may seem somewhat unappealing. The inside is not much better, however, the food should more than make up what the place lacks in decor.

The staff is very friendly, and service is pretty fast. Having tried plenty of authentic Persian food before I can say this place is up there.

If you're in the area, and in the mood for something different this may be a great choice to end your evening."}
{"text":"A nice Persian restaurant in a quite area, good food but pricy.  They served the food pretty fast. We ordered the chicken Soltani and the Koobideh. The Chicken was very good and koobideh was also not bad. I have been to Persian restaurants all around the country and I think the food here is a little over priced."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! We love the Barg filet! Portions are massive and you never leave hungry. Carry out is great after a long day. I also commend the shirin polo rice in place of regular rice."}
{"text":"This was our first Persian food experience...
I have to say the food was amazing! Great hummus, the pita was done perfectly!! Nice and warm. We had the Cornish hen filet mignon special with rice and a Greek salad,,,, lots of food,,, I mean lots of food enough to feed 6, and it was yummy!!

The server Shawn was extra cool. He was stuck there all by him self and he did a great job multitasking,,, he was very polite and we would go back there just because of his excellent service!!! Thanks Shawn !!! 

The only thing we would change is the decor, it looks like it used to be a sushi place,,, not very Persiany feeling.. That's the reason we gave it 4 stars.."}
{"text":"Glad we ate here.  Persian food is a little different than what is now standard Mediterranean food. Be adventuresome. The stews are great, but hard to pronounce.The host/waiter/server/wine steward was overwhelmed on the night we were there, but took his time explaining all the dishes, which were received with universal approval.  yum, yum."}
{"text":"Great Persian Food at a reasonable price.  The atmosphere is vintage Persian the staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"If you like Persian food this place \"Rocks!\"
Although most people go here for the Kabobs, the traditional Persian Dishes like gormeh sabzi, and gehmi with basmati rice are Fantastic too!

Definitely Five Stars."}
{"text":"Went in to get a to-go order. Place was as dead as it can get for a Sunday night in Scottsdale. 

I walked in to see two employees, I'm assuming the owner and the server, deep in conversation, not even caring to welcome me into their establishment. I mean, HELLO, I'M A PAYING CUSTOMER!!??? CAN YOU SEE ME???!! The owner then walks back into the backroom, the server walks over to the register and prints out my bill and hands it over to me, and saying, it'll be about 6 more minutes... still... NO GREETING!!! How does she even know what I'm there for!!???

When a client comes walking into my office, I stop my conversation with my co-worker and greet my client. I guess customer service isn't all too par at this restaurant. 

Food on the other hand, is good, but not worth the $17.00 for the chicken shish kebab. $17.00!!?? really?? Is this chicken marinated in gold??? DANG! 

 I'd rather go to The Persian room then ever come back to Pars. Lets class up the customer service experience! You're in a service industry! Smile! Greet! WELCOME PEOPLE!!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place for one reason. Ice cream. But service here is so horrible now. I can't comment on the food since we were never seated. The \"hostess\" was new and told us there were no tables available even though there were plenty of tables open. I asked why and she said those are all reserved for later...Hmm it was 6:45 and she said people had reservations for 6:30. That was the first issue. We've been here many times in the past, never with a reservation and this new hostess says they don't have a table for us. Then a server comes over and assures us we are not welcome there. Your job is to make customers feel welcomed, not kick them to the curb. Needless to say I will never come back. The only reason I've been going in the past was for their pistachio ice cream. All of the meat or chicken was always way too dry or undercooked. Rude service to say the least. They need to get rid of this horrible new staff and keep that help wanted sign on the window cause the staff they have now belongs at a walmart with their lack of hospitality. Go to Persian Room."}
{"text":"Lets first start with the ambiance. The furniture and decor was outdated. It was dark, gloomy, and far from elegant being the prices were more then your average restaurant. It needs a lot of gordon ramsays help to fix this restaurant. The service was average, if that. We started with the shirazi salad which contained diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, a little bit of EVOO, and a tremendous amount of lemon juice. It was very difficult to enjoy with the sour/tart aftertaste. Since this was our first time, we decided to order the chefs special platter. It contained chicken breast kebob, ground beef Kebob, and lamb Kebob. On top of that we also ordered the shish Kebob platter. This platter contained \"filet mignon\" Kebob (biggest lie, filet mignon isn't a thin strip of meat which is tough, unless they don't know how to cook it), another chicken breast Kebob and lamb Kebob. We ordered these platters for some variety, but the funny thing is, there was no variety. All of the meats were marinated in the same spices/sauce that in result, didn't allow us to differentiate between all of the different meats. I am a foody and I cook traditional shish Kebob at home, being that I am from the Middle East. This restaurant does not deserve to sell and advertise their horribly tasting Kebobs. Having said that, their basmati rice was my favorite dish. That is why I'm generous enough to give them two stars. In conclusion, 6 skewers of the same exact tasting meats, a huge portion of basmati rice, small bowl of salad, and two hot teas costed roughly 120 dollars with tip. Don't waste your time and gas. You would have a better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Did they get my grandmothers recipes!? The food here is really good, authentic and large servings. I went with a friend; next time we will split an entree next time. The hummus was fresh, the souvlaki was marinated and cook medium rare as requested and the salad had just enough feta. We did share a creme caramel and it was fab."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The lamb shishkabob was dry and tough.  The mahi mahi however was not bad. The basmatti rice was delicious. We got caught up in some extra charges we didn't know about but the manager was good enough to take them off. Our waitress was friendly and efficient.  All in all I doubt we will go back.  It's too expensive and too far off the beaten track.  We'll hit the Persian Room instead."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how good This place was compared to other places I've been to out the say the food with all great start out the hummus problem  Best that  I've ever had  The chicken was super juicy and very flavorful for breast meat I'm not a big rice person The rice that came of the meal was   Cooked perfectly Not dry lots of moisture left in it Service is great to the saver on top of things great suggesting things Deafening will make the trip back out there"}
{"text":"Place is small, but cozy. This means you'll have to wait awhile. 
Restaurant and restroom very clean, and beautiful ambiance. 
Short staffed but the waiters and service was outstanding and surprisingly fast. 
We waited too long to be seated due the the short staff, but it was well worth it. 
The Food: Amazing, every thing was delicious and the baklava with the Hot tea was the icing on the cake. 

If it wasn't for the short staff and the long wait, which hopefully they can remedy soon, I definitely would've given them 5 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood three weeks ago and Pars is right around the corner. We've already been here three times and are the new regulars. I am a self-admitted Persian food snob. 

The first time was takeout on moving day. A large portion of chicken shish kabob and it was good.

The next two times we ate in. As with every restaurant, dining in the food is even better! As others have said, Persian restaurants are known for large dinner portions and Pars is the same. My husband and I share an entree'. 

The first dine-in experience we enjoyed koobadeh (so delicious!) and the next visit we tried solanti. Both were excellent. I must say, the kind, attentive service we've had from different servers has been a pleasant surprise. We almost feel like we are dining at a friend's house because our every need was anticipated. We also tried the salad Shirazi (it was pretty good), the yougurt and mint dip (absolutely outstanding) and the hummus. I was shocked with how much I enjoyed the hummus as it is usually my husband's choice and not mine. It was so fresh tasting!

The prices are appropriate for the portion sizes. This is a low-key quiet dining kind of place and is a really great option to try Persian food for the first time as the atmosphere makes it not intimidating for first timers. Also easy to find and get to off of Shea Blvd and plenty of free parking close by."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here ever since they first opened.

I would say they make the best Persian food in Arizona.  Great food and great service.

My go to dish is the Kabab Koobideh, and they cook it perfectly.  It's very common for other restaurants to overcook them.  

I recommend Pars to everyone when I get asked about Persian food in Phx/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food without the unreal price. I used to go with a Persian co-worker, so he did all the ordering and also could critique the food from a position of proper knowledge. 

The ghormeh sabzi (a delightfully light stew that you will desire in the future after your first bite) is incredible and said coworker claimed it is the best he's had. The chefs special is 3 meats (chicken, steak and beef) platter that is great too, just be warned it is too much food for less than 3 people. Their sides of rice are served on a platter that could hold most Thanksgiving turkeys, and again it is great.

If there is one thing to note, be prepared for a dinner over 1 hour due to some of the dish preparation time."}
{"text":"Quality, Service, Class. This is properly fine dining.

They serve authentic skewers of heaven, and even the rice is good here (a lot of middle eastern restaurants overlook their rice, this was a most pleasant surprise). Service exceptional, and if you like wine the drinks are very well-priced. The beef sultani plates are exceptional, but if you are looking for somethingh different the chicken sultani is a very pleasant surprise.

A perfect date place if you want to impress."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I am sooo glad we ate here.  Our waitress was friendly and very informative and the food - delicious!  Of the four at our table, three ordered the specialty, koobideh-kebab, and BFF ordered the Sabzi Polo with Mahi-Mahi Kebab.  Ohmygoodness, just the thought makes my mouth water. 
The koobideh was tender and so flavorful, and the saffron rice was light and flavorful as well.  The sabzi polo with mahi mahi was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I'm telling you, we were all so pleased.
I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Been here on 3/22/14, the service was nice and there were good veg options too.. (As am vegie) liked the complimentary bread & onion. 

And there soup & oyster entree was awesome.. But keep in mind it bit pricey for what you get !!"}
{"text":"Best koubideh, chicken and filet combo I have ever had.  Can't stop eating when I'm here.  Hummus is outstanding, too."}
{"text":"I don't know a whole lot about Persian food, but stopped here for dinner tonight and thought it was quite good.  The lone guy serving all tables (not busy, it's Monday) was very pleasant and eager to please.  I had the chicken shish kebab; the chicken was very tender and juicy and was served with rice and grilled tomatoes & green peppers.  The hubs had the oyster mushroom dinner (same side dishes) and thought it was very good.  The portions were HUGE, so lots of leftovers for breakfast!  Overall, I thought it was good value for the money."}
{"text":"Yeah!  

On my first trip, I had the Lamb shank and it was absolutely great - the best lamb shank ever.  Girlfriend had the chicken kabob, it was good too.  On my second trip, I had the cornish game hen (grilled) - absolutely fabulous - moist, juicy, tasty.  Place has a nice, cozy feel to it and prices seem reasonable. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Persian food experience of my life. It is a small restaurant with no ambiance. One waiter for the whole place. The waiter was not flexible with the menu. It was expensive for a neighborhood dive and the food was tasteless. Go to the Persian Room instead.  Our food was so bad it wasn't even worth sending it back. 
Poor service
Poor ambiance
Poor food 
Poor experience 
Over priced
Promise not to waste your money!  There are so many amazing places to eat in Scottsdale don't pick this one.  That said, if you read my normal review I am generally a very positive person."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the lunch portion given take out, but the portions are pretty big and tasty.  My usual is the gyros plate, came with pita, basmati rice, side salad, and a whole roasted tomato. The meat are just four giant strips of meat diagonal on the to go box, and they had the right amount of salt as well as crispiness from the rotisserie process.

I had the appetizer combo plate once dining in, but the tray is huge! Would not recommend tackling with a party under four people.

For a $10 meal, the gyros plate was very good. I'm pretty sure you get more pita when you eat in, so make sure you do if you want to try out this awesome Persian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I wish I live close to this place, I love everything about this place, the food, the music, the service EVERYTHING
Open a Persian food by happy valley please, you will NOT lose anything"}
{"text":"I was craving hummus and my friend almost ripped my head off when I suggested Pita Jungle ...so there we were ..at Pars on a weekday night. We were both Pars virgins but the reviews had been good so we tried.

He ordered the Chef's special --ground beef, chicken filet, and filet mignon on skewers. It was served with basmati rice and grilled tomatoes.  This dish was $30, we shouldn't have been so greedy and ordered a second dish.  My dish was the Beef Shish which also came with basmati rice.  We also ordered the hummus I was so craving for.

Let me start by telling you the Chefs Special could serve a party of 3!!! My god, when the plate came out, I already started my food coma just looking at it.  The 3 meat combo was ...ORGASMIC! The rice was soft and cooked just right. My beef shish was so so, I wish I had just eaten off my friend's plate. :)  The hummus was VERY GOOD...we asked for extra pita bread just to wipe the plate clean.

Now on to the atmosphere. There is a little patio for outside seating if you're interested. The inside has a bar and...well, when I first walked in, I almost choked. The smell was ....overwhelming. In a bad way.  This is a horrible way to describe the smell and I'm sorry....but I thought I was walking in to a rest stop restroom.  /)_(\ SORRY!! My friend tells me that's how Persian food is supposed to smell like!!  But man...it took a good 30 minutes before my nose was accustomed to the smell.

Aside from the smell, cus I know it's just me.......I gave this restaurant 5 stars for the quality of the food, the fast and friendly service as well as price.  I WILL come back....and breathe through my mouth only for the 1st 30 minutes next time.   Just because they're worth it.  hehe."}
{"text":"Great Persian food and ambiance  I would give them 4.5 stars if I could but between 4 and 5 I have to go 5.  Where to start:

Excellent tah deeg (the crispy rice that is made at bottom of the pot when you make Persian white rice).  We covered our tah deeg with an herb stew called Khoresh Gormeh Sabzee (Khoresh is a stew kind of alike in concept to an Indian curry, except with totally different spices, while Sabzee means herbs/greens, so it's essentially an herb/green stew with kidney beans and tender beef).  Gormeh Sabzee is probably the most popular khoresh in Iran.  What a delicious starter.

We couldn't decide between the ground beef kabob (an Iranian staple analogous to a cheeseburger in the U.S.), the chicken (called joojeh) kabob, or the lamb shank, so we got all three.  Waaaaaaayyyyy too much food but it was good.  Kabobs vary greatly in Persian cuisine, with everyone having a different take.  This was a plump, lean, and juicy kabob with a mild flavor...I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 which is good.  The joojeh (chicken) kabob needed to be marinated longer in lemon and onion but was cooked very well.  The lamb shank was very good and almost great.  Altogether very good Persian and I would recommend it to anyone, particularly if you've never tried Persian food before and want your first time to be memorable.  The prices were very reasonable ($10-$20 per entree) and we gourged for 2 for $50 including a martini..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find solid Persian food in Scottsdale -- not what we expected. I got the Pars special (steak, kebab, and cornish game hen). I did not realize how much food they give in these combos. Beyond the proportions, the flavor of the meat was good (well seasoned and reminded me of the great Persian restaurant, Persepolis, that we used to frequent in Manhattan). Anyhow, if you like Persian or middle eastern food, in general, this place will definitely do the trick."}
{"text":"We went here last night with a group of 8 friends. I had gotten take out from here once before but never dined in. The service was great, fresh pitas were brought out immediately with onions/butter. The waiter did a good job answering any questions for those of us who hadn't had persian food before. We ordered the ground beef with saffron rice with berries and a side of yogurt. This was enough for two people. The beef was excellent, moist and flavorful. The yogurt dip with cucumber and garlic was great for dipping the meat and rice. Next time I'll have to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"If you appreciate middle-eastern food an/or persian food, you will \"love\" Pars.  

The owner is always in the back cooking up an amazing and consistently great tasting meal.

By far, they have the best hummus in town.  Pars puts Pita Jungle's hummus to shame.

All of their meat skewers are great but the mahi mahi is out of this world.  He also cooks amazing Zeresch Polo (rice with barberries) and everything is so flavorable.  

Although it's hidden in NE Scottsdale, it's well worth the drive and wait!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant.  I had heard that the food was wonderful.  The food did turn out to be excellent but the service was terrible.  Considering the prices, I would have expected better service.  There was no welcome.  After we were seated, the waiter did not come back to the table for w full ten minutes.  When she came back, there were no pleasantries, such as \"Do you have any questions?\"  She said \" do you know what you want to order?\".  We ordered a first course, which was wonderful.  When the first course came, there was no effort to clear the plates that were already on the table.  We ended up holding plates in the air until the main course was on the table.  When we looked around the at the rest of the tables, the wait staff did the same thing to other tables.  I saw many guests holding plates in the air to make room for their new courses.   Because the wait staff was no unprofessional and leadened, the dinner was ruined.  It is a shame because the food was so good.  When you spend $140 for dinner for 4, you expect service."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in a N. Scottsdale strip mall.  Delicious food, huge servings, and incredible service.  I had the gyro plate, and my dinner partners had chicken shish kabob, Mahi mahi, and the filet kabob.  All of us raved about our meals and would like to come back to expand our knowledge about Persian food."}
{"text":"It was just OK. I haven't found a really amazing Middle Eastern restaurant yet in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yummy Iranian food!!! I always enjoy eating here! The service is fast, friendly and the atmosphere is either romantic and/or very relaxing!  The spot for a great dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've worked here for years, so I'm obviously biased. So I'll give my perspective from behind the scenes. First, the chef/owner truly takes pride in his cooking and goes out of his way to get the best quality meat for his restaurant. I haven't worked here in quite some time but we still make it a point to go back several times a month. I can say that it's difficult to keep servers here because they really feel the ups and downs of the economy with where they're located, tucked away in the corner of Scottsdale. I have no doubt that if he moved into a larger restaurant in old town Scottsdale he'd be one of the most popular restaurants in the city consistently. As a middle eastern woman, I'm picky about my Persian food and his is the best. My recommendations are: Go there with a couple of friends so you can eat family style and really experience the food. Start with the Tah Dig (Go in the evening so it's available) with both toppings, then order the Pars Special with Zereshk Polo Rice. His cornish hen is to die for and his barberry rice (Zereshk) is absolutely the best I've ever had. End your meal with the homemade baklava and Persian tea or Greek coffee. Don't forget to try the Armenian wine for dinner (the bottle is well priced) 
This meal is perfect for 4 people and you'll probably still have some to take home. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent service, food (fresh/hot/flavorful), consistent!! We were in town for 2nights and came here twice! All the meat dishes are great and no one can ever argue about Persian rice--the fluffier the better!! Would strongly recommend this place to friends/fam or people wanting to try Persian Cuisine"}
{"text":"Great hummus and shallot dip (the added currants are a nice touch).  The koobideh is very juicy and well seasoned, and the albalo polo is very good.  We also shared a stew that was filled with chunks of meat.  Service was attentive as well.  Only bad thing about this place is its location, it's sort of out of the way unless you live in East Scottsdale."}
{"text":"With limited options in the Phoenix area for proper Persian food, I'm very pleased to have discovered this place! While it's a bit of a pain to get to if you don't frequent the area, I've been here a handful of times and have enjoyed my meals both in the restaurant and with the take out.

I normally order the chicken thigh kebab, which is well cooked, seasoned and prepared. Sometimes at Persian places I find the chicken is slightly undercooked, in an attempt to keep it juicy, but here I have never had that problem. I've never been disappointed when dining here with any of their offerings. I've sampled their hummus and other dips which are excellent as well. Their baklava is well made and not too sweet (way better than the strange dry baklava they serve at the Persian Room). The stews are also quite tasty so I'd say you can't really go wrong with whatever you order.

The atmosphere is more on the quiet side, and I've never seen it busy. They always have many tables open and are ready to serve you."}
{"text":"Solid persian food.  Have the beef platter - it comes with some kind of ground beef and sirloin on skewers.  Served on a bed of saffron rice.  Its all very delicious, and even better the next day.  $20/plate, but you can share between 2 people and be full.  Love the complimentary pita bread!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service and food. The owner is very condescending and rude. Stay away. If you're hungry go to the Taco Bell right across..."}
{"text":"We now live in Vegas.  We have searched all over Vegas for Persian or Middle Eastern food that matches the quality and taste of Pars to no avail.  

The Gyros at Pars are the best I've had and all of the other dishes are very authentic.  We have never waited for a meal or had a server that is anything other than very polite.  Even the tea is exceptional.  

The dinner prices are fair considering the portion size (yes, you can easily get two meals out of each plate unless you are accustomed to overeating).  Their lunches are huge and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"Persian Food at its best! I eat 

I ate at the other Persian restaurant  here but this is a much better food.
Place is relaxing. My wife and I used the patio dining and it was great. The waiter was polite and helpful. I cant say their traditional persian deseret;\" Zolbia and Bamieh\" was good but the quality as well as the taste and aroma of the Persian dishes were so good that I cant help saying it was 5 out of 5.  Will go to Pars again and again."}
{"text":"Food was eh...kid that took my to-go order doesn't know the menu so couldn't describe anything. I ordered food for three adults and a child and it came to $80...appalling. There was NO reason that food in styrofoam containers should cost that much."}
{"text":"It is always a treat to eat here. The tastes are delicious and exotic and the staff is helpful. 

A great balance between affordable and romantic. 

Amazing Persian rugs on the walls as well!

You must try the filet mignon (Barg) with the raisin and date rice (adas polo). One of the most delicious meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Delicious and truly Persian. We ate from lunch menu, large portions, very reasonably priced,  and came with salad. Ash Resti excellent!!  Chicken melted on your mouth. Balmei and zulbia good flavor, but could be fresher. We were there Monday afternoon so I kind of expected that. Ghormeh Sabzi over tad digh pricey but delicious. we will return!!!"}
{"text":"There are not enough stars up there!  I would give 10 perfect stars!  Masoud is the best chef in the world!  The food is always perfect and amazing.  I'm dieing to eat there right now!  All the staff, David and Nadia are the nicest ever!  Worth flying from Seattle to Scottsdale just for dinner!  I recommend the Zereshk Polo!  Amazing!  I love Pars!  Please expand and come to Seattle!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place every Friday. The kabobs are good. The service is decent. But to charge a side for asking extra peperoncini peppers. THATS RIDICULOUS. First I thought it was a mistake so I asked the waitress. She then told me that the owner asked her to charge extra.
That was the last time I was there. Persian Room, here i come! 
I love that food, but the attitude has to change."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The Sultani plate (filet & ground beef kabab combo)was cooked nicely. And the Persian Ice Cream for dessert finished our meal off perfectly. Our server, Sean, was absolutely fantastic. He was friendly and helpful with choosing our dinner. My husband and I have found our new regular place. He can't stop talking about how good dinner was."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Great Persian food. Yes it's not a 4000 sq ft restaurant but it's good food. Not much options for middle eastern  food in the valley, this place makes up for it. Shaun our server was absolutely amazing, he did a great job with a smile. Highly recommend this place for dinner. My favorite is the sultani. Make reservations for Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food wasn't that tasty. Waste of money. We order  2 lamb shanks and asked to give different rice for one and they  charged 8$ extra for substituting. Never going back."}
{"text":"Great place! I own the spa across the street (Hawaiian Experience Spa) and finally have driven by Pars hundreds of times. Finally, I made the time to check out this unique restaurant. 

We went for lunch on a Sunday, and everything was great. My only complaint, so to speak, was that there was no lunch menu and the dinner portions are too large for me for lunch. I ended up getting Chicken-Kabob and my wife just got soup and we split everything. It was still $31 with a tip with no drinks.

Still, the food was excellent, the service was great, and it was a nice quiet place. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley. Having grown up in the ME living next to Persian neighbors, I know when I am having good quality Persian/Iranian food. The kebabs, the salad Olivier, the rice, everything is cooked to perfection and is very authentic. I am so glad we have such great quality food away from home. Recommended for sure. Although I have one check in here, I've been there more than 5-6 times already in the past 10 months! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food tasted A-Ok but I'm not in a rush to go back. I ordered the Lamb Shank  ($21) along with the Basmati Rice and the Shirazi Salad ($5.50). 

I thought the lamb was decent, but it didn't make my top ten list. Pars gives you so much rice, that you can have a party of about 50 people at your house and it would be enough for 50 people. Why too much rice, more lamb please. I guess I'm not a fan of Basmati Rice. I also had the Shirazi Salad, which I thought was very tasty and the best part of my Pars experience. In fact, I make this salad at home all the time now. The salad has diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and is sprinkled with lemon juice and olive oil. 

The total tab, which included tip for 4 people was $140."}
{"text":"Pars Persian Cuisine is a formal full service restaurant with linen topped tables but there isn't a dress code and you can come as you are. They offer a long menu of Persian Food that you don't come by at the majority of Persian Restaurants in Metro Phoenix.

They started us off with a complimentary basket of hot pita bread, creamy butter and sliced sweet onions.

We shared a few plates. One was Zereshk Polo with Chicken. It's a very large plate of fluffy Basmati Rice mixed with tart barberries, almonds and saffron. The plate came with two meaty, fall off the bone tender chicken legs that seemed like they were slow cooked in apple, carrots, garlic, onions and seasonings. This plate was really good and interesting. It wasn't spicy or very strong with any seasoning but was balanced and very well flavored.

We also shared the Fessenjen and Shirin Pollo. One is a Fried Walnut and Pomegranate Chicken Stew. That contained two good sized chunks of very tender chicken in a fruity sweet and sour sauce that doesn't look very attractive. Instead of the standard rice you do have the option to upgrade to something more interesting and we upgraded to the Specialty Rice  called Shirin Polo that is Fluffy Basmati Rice with Candied Orange Peel, Carrots, Almonds, Pistachios, Sweet syrup and Saffron. This rice was delicious but did run on the sweet side like it is suppose to. BTW-The portions of rice are EXTREMELY LARGE and are enough for two people. 

We got some of the food packaged up so we could try the Saffron Pistachio Ice Cream. The Ice cream was served in a nice chilled dessert glass and the Ice Cream was incredibly creamy with a great flavor!

The waiter that served us was very friendly, helpful and efficient.

We both enjoyed what we tried and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Flavorful and fabulous! Yes that is what the food is in this place that is family owned and run. Laila the daughter of the chef/owner is so hospitable, efficient and pleasant. All the kebabs are wow! The rice is perfect! The cornish hen is a must have....and the Kubbideh"}
{"text":"We had never had persian food before, just other Mediterranean and some Middle Eastern food, which it seemed like this was a mix of those regional foods? Based on the yelp recommendations, we made sure to share our dish since it sounded like you get quite a bit of food. 

We got the chicken olivea salad, which is like a chicken/tuna/potato salad, really tasty with our pita bread. It had chicken, green beans, potatoes and lots of mayo, along with tomatoes and pickles on the side. We had leftovers, so I'm making a sandwich out of it! We also shared the sultani combo which had filet mignon and ground beef kebabs. They were both really tasty, and we especially liked the filet mignon. The combo came with batsmati rice and a tomato/cucumber/onion salsa type salad that came on the side. We had the persian ice cream for dessert since we read so much good stuff about it. It was really tasty considering it's a fancy vanilla ice cream. The rose water and pistachios added a nice touch of flavor that was yummy

There was one guy working, who was basically the host, waiter, and busboy, and he did an excellent job! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"On our latest visit to Mesa, AZ we made a wonderful discovery - Pars Persian Cuisine.  We have eaten at many Persian restaurants in California and now Arizona for about 15 years.  Both the food and the service were excellent!  I had the lamb shank with baghali polo and my husband had the sultani kabob.  The roasted tomato was perfectly done with no burnt black spots.  The homemade pita bread with the piaz (onion) and sabzi (basil) were fantastic.  I also ordered khashk-e-bademjan (the roasted eggplant) appetizer.  We will definitely be back in February, when we stay in Gold Canyon for the Arizona Renaissance Faire.  It will be worth the drive.  This is a restaurant not to be missed!"}
{"text":"When I walked in I was given a cozy and intimate vibe. The hummus was spectacular and pita was fresh and their house-made hot tea was spicy and complex.  When I ordered the Zeresk Polo with Chicken,  it was described as a beautiful medley of spices that caught my eye. The presentation of the dish was attractive.  However,  when it came out, I was extremely underwhelmed and it was just a tasteless organization of a well-cooked chicken.  While the meal wasn't bad, it was definitely not great.  For the price,  this is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"My children love Pars. We have a few dietary restrictions in the house, gluten free for our daughter and our son only eats vegetarian food. Pars has been a local favorite, 98% gluten free, huge variety of vegan/vegetarian foods and is truly a life savor on days where we have no time to cook. I highly recommend their oyster mushroom kebab. Gluten free and vegan yet very filling and tasty. The atmosphere is very homey and comfortable. This business is family owned and when you walk in you feel at home because they treat you like family. Some other favorites on the menu for my wife and I are, their Pars shish combo platter, their Pars appetizer platter and the variety of specialty rice's to choose from. The zereshk polo (barberry rice) is very delicious! They also have a home made saffron/pistachio ice cream that is a must try, save some room because their portions are nice and big and you can get lost in the taste and easily have no room in the end."}
{"text":"Low this place! First time I ate here, Sold! Flavorful food, my kind of huge portions, and amazing price, with a nice restaurant presentation. I feel like I walk into a palace. Haha. Highly recommend all the food lovers to try this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place.  The tadig, ghormeh sabzi, rice, koobideh, and everything else were great.  Been going to the persian room for years ,once in a while.  This place is much smaller and the food is much better.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was very very good. The basmati rice was moist and fragrant, and the filet mignon skewer was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  The oyster mushroom kebab was terrifically juicy. Portions are plentiful.


Service was friendly, but a bit slow due to limited number of staff (it seemed like only one waitress was working Saturday night). We ordered the specialty appetizer plate of hummus and spreads, and devoured the (warm, delicious) pita bread way too quickly. The waitress promised to bring another batch, but got busy taking all the other orders. In the end, the owner brought out the pita bread himself, which we appreciated. 

Definitely recommended for Persian food in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. 

Basmati rice: Flavorful and fluffy
Hummus: Delicious
Chicken: Perfectly tender and skewered

Overall: A great experience. We sat on the patio on a nice spring day. Our waitress was courteous and kind."}
{"text":"By far the best Persian food in Phoenix.   The Oyster mushroom entree is amazingly flavorful, and the rice was out of this world.   The shish kebab plate with chicken, beef and lamb were far more flavorful and tender than Persian Room.  Persian Room is good, but doesnt compare with the flavors at Pars.   Pars is absolutely the best Persian in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is so Delicious ! I found it while driving in the shopping plaza & boy am I glad that I did.  There are many places that offer the same dishes but in comparison I won't say names because I don't think that's fair to do, Pars is top notch in quality & quantity. 

Customer service is a 10 

Food is a 10 

Prices are a bit higher than most so I'll give it a 6  but it's the location & the quality of the meat so they get a pass.  

Full bar 10 

Always clean & always get the to go order correct 

I believe my lunch special was $12.50 at dinner time the same plate jumps to $20 

Appetizers range from $6.50 - $14

I'll keep coming back for the freshness & deliciousness 

Keep up the good work Pars & fellow YELPERS give em a taste"}
{"text":"If you just want something that resembles Iranian food then this should be a good place for you, but if you know what a good Iranian food tastes like then this is not your place. This place lost the \"it\" factor."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep the 4 star rating because so much of their stuff is so good, but I just had their 'filet mignon' skewer and ... if that's filet mingon then I'm the Prince of Persia! Filet Mignon is unbelievably tender and generally cubed (in this context). What I was served was thinly sliced, and quite tough. Not terribly tough, but certainly not melt-in-the-mouth that you would expect from filet mignon. If you want to call it 'tender beef' or something, go for it but please, not f.m.!  Beer prices were $1 off so that's a good sign! 

They also have beautiful artwork on the walls - very unusual stuff brought over from Iran."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Everything is made fresh that day. Great service. Staff was very friendly and the food was amazing... reasonably prices too! Best Persian food around. Hands down!!

Great for large groups and kids."}
{"text":"For a healthy, gluten free dining Persian food is an excellent choice. I have been coming to Pars for 5 years now.  The food is amazing.  I have even used them for 3 catering events.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Sultani.  Great place for a date night, during with kids or large gatherings."}
{"text":"I was in the other night with my mother for dinner.  We both enjoyed the experience very much.

To start we had the Maust Khiar yogurt appetizer.  Flavored with mint and diced cucumber it was light and refreshing. Perfect for dipping with the warm pita bread.

We both ordered stews for our main course.  I had the Gheimeh Bademjan which was basically a beef stew.  Served with a side plate of rice it was delicious.

My mom ordered the Fessenjan.  It was a chicken stew flavored with walnuts and pomegranate.  It was a very different flavor than I have ever had and quite good too.

I'd like to come back here soon and try their other interesting menu items."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing. Omg!!  I'm so happy we found Pars. Everything we eat we amazing!  5-star for sure. 

The Boyles"}
{"text":"First time there at  lunch today.  Nice little cafe and the service was great.  The food was tasty and fresh. True to its roods, yummy persian food. I'll go there again."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, the location is not the best and place is small and a little too dark.  The Kabab's are okay, they were a little bland.  The Ghormeh Sabzi was delicious.  The ice cream is awesome.  The rice portions are a little smaller than what I am used to at Persian restaurants.  Overall it is a good place and I would go back."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Great food no matter what your order without the Scottsdale unnecessary mark up.  The food is fresh.  The service tries hard but they need another waiter.  Ask the waiter to bring you an assortment of food and wine to match.  The meat is grilled to perfection.  The sides are great.  you can't go wrong with anything here.  Remember this is Persian.  Dont' go thinking Gyros or anything but a full dining experience complete with complementary wine.  The best thing it's all healthy and reasonably priced.  I would keep apps at a minimum and load up on the grilled meat."}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you that I have been eating Persian food for 30 years, all over the country, as it is one of my favorite types of cuisine...... And this is BAR NONE the best I've ever had.

Typically when I call to ask a Persian eatery if they have tah-dig available at opening time (11:00-11:30 am) they cannot accomodate my request ...as it is \"the crispy bottom of the rice pot\" and they need to serve the pot of rice before getting to the delicious bottom. I have even had one manager laugh at me when I asked for it!!! At Pars, they ALWAYS have it available for me! Maybe i've just been lucky as gfar as timing goes...but if they have it available, GET IT..with BOTH stews. Fantastic! 

I have not seen Olivieh salad(app) at ANY Persian restaurant in AZ!. And they make it beautifully here! 

The Kashk-o-bademjan is wonderful, too! As is the Maust O khair(apps)

We usually get the Sultani dish(combo of succulent tender filet mignon along with koobideh), and the chicken Shish dish..giant beautiful pieces of chicken breast..seasoned to perfection!
The meals are accompanied by a grilled tomato..yum! And vidalia onions(so sweet, my husband eats them like potato chips!) & the homemade pita bread....heavenly. 
 
Everything on the menu is fantastic..but we tend to gravitate towards the aforementioned menu items. Even when we get it for take out, they take extra special care packaging it up for you, so it doesn't spill on the way home....AND they always include a little bit of sumac..without even having to ask!   There is so much food, it usually lasts us ALL MEALS for 2 days. 
It's very reasonably priced & the staff is so kind, warm & wonderful. They really treat us as if they value our business. It's a really GOOD feeling. 

I'll wrap it up by saying this.....we drive an hour and a half (1-1/2 hrs) round trip for this food & it is worth every second of driving time & worth every penny we spend on fuel.
You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Great for vegetarians!  Try the mushrooms!

We've hit up Pars a couple of times when we were stuck in a food rut.  Both times I was very impressed with the experience.  The decor leaves a bit to be desired - it is very dated inside and quite small and dark.  The wine list was also a bit of a drag - pretty cheap selections and nothing unique.  Instead, I had a beer with dinner.  The two of us ordered:

Vegetarian Platter (Dolmeh, Maust' Khiar & Hummus) and the Oyster Mushroom Kebab to split.  My boyfriend is HUGE eater, and we were stuffed by the end of the meal - I definitely recommend splitting unless you love leftovers.  

Great food - we will definitely be back the next time we can't decide where to head in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is delicious, the service is outstanding, and the prices are very reasonable. I wish we lived closer to it, but as it is we make an effort to come here when we are in town every year for Spring Training. The stews in particular have a unique depth of flavor. I highly recommend that everyone check this place out and see for themselves what a great spot it is!"}
{"text":"It has been a while so I thought 'why always bitch?  I can speak of Pars....an excellent restaurant. Healthy delicious fresh food. Clean great restaurant. We love it.........if you care about your coronary arteries you should dine here. The seasoning is subtle, the rice fluffy....the salad crazy fresh...the drinks delicious.  I love the kabobs, but I don't have a guild to help me order so I Avoid the food I don't understand.  The kabobs are grilled. Low fat. Very good meat. 
Love you."}
{"text":"Pretty good meal. It was our first time eating Persian. We ordered the Pars Shish-Kebabs (Lamb shish-kebab, koobideh & chicken shish kebab served with Basmati rice). It was more than what the two of us could eat. The portions were great. The meat was tender, but didn't quite pack the flavor punch we were expecting.  Service was also pretty good.

 I have to admit that I was a little distracted by the football game on the TV at the bar. I felt it took away from the atmosphere. Overall, it was a good experience. I would give it a 3.5 it I could."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for leading me here! It was a great tip, as I've had a craving for shish kebab lately. 

I came in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The restaurant was empty at the time. At first glance, the restaurant is small, but the design was very elegant. There was interior and exterior seating and a bar area. We were greeted by Leyla who had a big smile on her face and was very welcoming and helpful.

I had viewed the Pars menu the previous weekend, but needed to look through it again to remind myself what it was that caught my eye before. It didn't take me long to realize I was there for the shish kebab and selected the lamb shish kebab. I typically don't select an appetizer or side dish, but this was my first time at Pars so I wanted to go a little all out. Leyla knew my companion and I were new to Pars so she provided some really good recommendations. We had the Maust' Mooster, which was plain yogurt with shallots to go with pita bread, which was warm, but not toasted. Unexpectedly, it turned out great. I loved how the pita bread was warm, but not toasted because I typically have it toasted. The yogurt had a little bit of a salty flavor to it, which was unexpected as well, but appreciated. 

The lamb shish kebabs came out aromatic. The rice was white with saffron on it. I loved how the rice was so fluffy. I can't remember the last time I had rice that fluffy. I have to figure out how to get my rice that fluffy. The shish kebab wasn't skewered, which was fine. The lamb was tender and could easily sliced using spoon and fork. I loved the texture of the tomatoes and the onions were a great complement with the lamb and rice. 

I didn't intend on getting dessert as I was very satisfied with what I had, but my companion ordered the Persian ice cream, which comprised of pistachios and honey. I think Leyla mentioned that it also had cashews. The ice cream was made at the restaurant. It was thick and creamy. It was delicious, but not too sweet. 

I really enjoyed my visit and will definitely be a return customer!"}
{"text":"Rice and chicken are great with the yogurt. Service was helpful and friendly, a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great Persian restaurant since my last dining experience at Doostan. It was quite a drive for me, but I enjoyed the food so much that I came for dinner twice within the same week. The vibe seemed subdued from the lack of patrons, but the quiet atmosphere made it a cozy place to bring dates and small gatherings. Along with the front patio, there was a full bar situated next to the entrance. Past the partition was the dining area with scores of smaller tables surrounding the long vertical one for large gatherings. The blue, purple, and beige d√©cor nicely complemented the warm lighting and a number of paintings on the walls.

Their complementary pita bread was thick, fluffy, and pillow-like with a hint of smoke. It was a great starter with Halim Bademjan ($7.50) assembled with fried eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and other seasoning. The consistency was not as thick or flavorful as the one at Flame International. However, the pronounced garlic flavor was a hit when added to the soft smoky pita. My only wish was for the eggplant flavor to stand out more. It was good, but not mind blowing.

The Lamb Shish-Kebab ($21) was put together with chunks of marinated lamb, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and at my request, cherry rice ($4.50).  The lamb was tender and moist with full-on flavor. The cuts were chewy, but I could taste the saffron as the mix of cherry was delicious in the basmati. For the price, I wished there could be more cherries in the basmati, but the lamb made quite an impression. 

The Chicken Shish-Kebab ($17) arrived with charbroiled marinated chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and choice of dill and lima beans rice ($4.5). The chicken came with tremendous wow factor: super moist, juicy, and flavorful. The dill and lima beans basmati was not overpowering, and instead the taste was complementary to the chicken.

The Cornish Hen Kebob ($17) was equally outstanding. This dish came with an entire Cornish Hen served bone-in, and each piece was evenly cooked to perfection to render a meaty juicy sensation. The cherry rice was again a hit. I will go the distance whenever I can find cherry rice. 

Lastly, the Salmon Kebob ($18.50) came with marinated salmon and basmati rice mixed with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro. The salmon was tender but slightly overdone. The rice had a smooth refined flaovr as a secondary to provide depth. I wasn't particularly blown away by this dish, especially since the previous dishes were really outstanding. Among them, I'm still partial to the Lamb and Chicken Kebob. 

Service was inconsistent, as my dining companion drank from a dirty glass without knowing it until the end of his meal. My second visit fared much better. The server was knowledgeable, friendly, highly attentive, and invited us to return. Here's one of the few legitimate places to grab Persian cuisine in this area. I'd be very interested in coming back to try the Persian Ice Cream, Baklava, and Zoombia & Bamieh."}
{"text":"Food is good but not gluten free. If you have celiac or medically need to eat gluten free I would not eat here. They put wheat pita on top of their dishes. Even if you ask for no pita it is being handled and present in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Friends took us for dinner. They had nice outdoor seating which we enjoyed.  The service was friendly, but forgetful, had to be reminded of several things.  

Food was overall quite good. Kabob meats were moist and tasty. They had many flavored rice sides, forms of biryani, that were interesting and fun. Try different ones and share them around. The lamb shank was spectacular.  The baklava was meh."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that I'm persian and grew up with persian food. The food at Pars is very authentic. The kababs are moist and delicious and the saffron rice is to die for. 
I can make most of the stews at home but somehow I haven't met anyone yet that can make kabobs at home as good as at a restaurant. I still have to learn the secret of the perfect persian kabob. 
The Soltani platter is a little pricey but its my absolute favorite. 
Don't forget to try the house made, persian ice cream sandwiches. Its delicious and you will end up licking your fingers at the end."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The beef and lamb are super juice and tasty.  It is better thank Persian Room.  The staffs are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great service. My husband loved his food. I only wish they had more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the food here is fantastic. Having been raised on Mediterranean food, I am a tough critic. I have heard people gush over the Persian Room...meh. But, the food at Pars is next level. The koobideh was moist and cooked to perfection! What started the meal for me was the torshi and it was as good as it gets, though an acquired taste...try try try. When eating Persian food 'fresh is best' and everything looks as if it was fresh from the garden, even the seared tomatoes served as a garnish ( I ate them).  Every time we go into the restaurant the service is impeccable and the cleanliness is obvious. So, though it may be a drive from the central Scottsdale culinary scene, I can assure you once you try the food you will gladly burn the gas ! One word, awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, we had the ground beef and lamb kebabs.  High quality, fresh, tasty.  First on many visits."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by stating this was the most pathetic excuse of a restaurant that I have ever been to. It was so terrible that my dad at one point got up and left because he was so angry with it. I don't even know how to write a review for such a terrible experience. I guess this will be a learning experience.

Let's begin with the background: my mom and sister, my dad, and I all met here on a Sunday night. My dad got here 25 minutes before me, I got there 10 minutes before my mom and sister. We are approached and my dad is asked if he would like anything to drink. Me? Not so much. 

Fast forward 15 minutes. We start the ordering process. I felt things might go a little south. I didn't realize it would be as bad as it was. I kind of get a snooty response to my (picky) order. Whatever, no big deal. We get the pita bread and hummus, which is albeit DECENT. Not AMAZING. Decent. I finish my soda and it takes 20 minutes to get a refill.  Also takes 15 minutes to get more pita bread for the hummus. Strike #1 and #2.

My order comes out fine with my moms. My sister's food also arrives at the same time as us, but her order is screwed up (dark chicken instead of light chicken). Woops. Strike #3. My dad's order hasn't even came out yet because \"lamb takes longer to cook.\" No problem, the rest of us will start eating without him! TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LATER, MY DAD'S FOOD IS BROUGHT OUT. Unacceptable, right? Well, the order is messed up too! So they take it back and fix it. They bring it back. Still screwed up. They go and fix it again. Still screwed up. At this point, my dad gets up and leaves. Strike #4.

Now, we're sitting here without my dad and you know what, we still haven't received an apology yet. Our server has walked past us multiple times, each time ignoring us. Wow. She finally comes back and apologizes, blaming it on the chef in the back. You'd think that the service would improve after this... but not so much. It is still taking forever to get more pita bread and refills.

Meanwhile, the legendary owner comes out! Why? Because he screwed up a to-go order and to remake it for that guy! I didn't even hear him apologize to that guy. I see him and he doesn't even come over to our table (we know he knew too, as our server told us she'd talked to him). No apology from him whatsoever. At this point, I'm thinking, \"Okay, that apology better come in the form of a free dinner. This has been such a terrible disaster that we had a family member get up and leave, plus you screwed up another family member's meal and the best we've got is a hardly empathetic apology.\" 

Well, the check comes folks. Full price on everything. Game over. Good bye Pars. I wanted to go into the back and tell the owner that he created a worst dining experience than every other bad dining experience I've had, combined. Unacceptable behavior from Pars and my family will not be coming back. 

You want to know the worst part about this review? I'm not even exaggerating. I'm actually leaving some parts out. I wish I didn't have to  write this. I'm tempted to create 100 accounts right now to 1 star this place into oblivion. Never witnessed a place less worthy of 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary here. We love the Fesenjan stew. Instead of the regular rice we ordered zereshk polo. We enjoyed the persian tea. The only thing that I would stay away from is the complimentary starter of pita and butter/onion. This did upset our tummys slightly. At other restaurants they offer lavash bread with feta or butter and also cucumber / mint / cilantro mix - that is so much more delicious! Service was good."}
{"text":"I read the negative reviews I ignored it and paid the price and now I am filled with remorse and wish I didn't go. The Italian restaurant next door was the better option, or maybe Arby's."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend one evening, and we were seated quickly,  though the place was kind of dead. The friendly waiter brought out pitas and drinks,  and we got our order fairly quickly. And let me tell you,  what an order!  Tons of food! I got the Chicken Barg-Sultani, and it was super delicious. Great rice and salad.  Though  really, the order could have been half the size and price and It would have been just as good. Not sure if the huge plates of food are a cultural thing,  meant to be shared? Not used to that,  but good to know for next time. 

It definitely cured my desire for something different that evening!"}
{"text":"Phenomenally good healthy food.   Fresh made Baklava.   Nice ambiance and the wait staff take the time to recognize your needs."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall local restaurant that serves really delicious Persian dishes. We each have our faves; my hubby loves the Chicken Sultani while I prefer the Zeresk Polo. But of course we always start with their humus which is served with nice warm pitas."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Masoud even tells you how he makes the food. I wish you all success buddy. You are a pleasant person"}
{"text":"I'm 100% persian and was born and raised in LA. I've tasted some of the best home made and restaurant persian food in my time and Pars is nothing short of the best. Quality is always spot on and the meals are authentic. This is the only Persian restaurant that I'll dine at in Arizona."}
{"text":"All the food is made fresh and you just have to try it once to see how fantastic it is! This was our first time here. The service was fast and friendly. She helped us pick the appetizer platter to get a variety of \"salads\" or dips to put on your pita bread. Bold with flavor and everything was exciting to try. I had the salmon kabob with cilantro and my husband had the filet kabob. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I am going to preface this review by stating that I have never had Persian food before. Mediterranean yes, but Persian specific, no. We arrived on Saturday night, around 7:30 and the restaurant was busy, but not packed. We waited a few minutes for the host to come by and then were seated. This is not the type of place where they are going to hold your hand to get to your table and then describe things to you. Did not bother me in the least. 

Our waitress quickly came by to introduce herself,  take drink orders, and drop off some pita, butter, and onion. Upon receiving our drinks we ordered the appetizer platter. When we told her we weren't quite ready to order she gave us time, but then came back within an appropriate amount of time to check-up (I find a lot of places they nearly forget about you if you aren't ready right away, so this was nice). 

The appetizer platter was huge and we barely made a dent. I especially liked the dolmeh and Maust' Khiar. For my entree I ordered the Sultani: filet and koobideh, going 1/2 salad and 1/2 rice for the side. I thought this was very good. The filet had a nice flavor and was tender. The koobideh had a distinct flavor of it's own that I very much enjoyed. The rice and salad were a nice compliment. I didn't even come close to finishing my plate; you definitely get plenty of food.  My friends ordered a variety of other dishes ranging from one of the stews to the gyro platter. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. 

We agreed that we would not go out of our way to visit very often, but the food was great Persian if you are in the area and hungry for that type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while trying to figure out where to go for dinner. The food was amazing. Some of the best hummus I've had since moving here. I got the chicken kabob the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry like I've had at other places. I love the option for a half salad because those dishes typically come with so much rice. The wine options were great as well. I love the interior design and ambiance of the place. Service was friendly. They definitely gained a new customer!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than PARS. The best pita, beef dishes, and rice dishes around. Be sure to get the Zeresk polo- my favorite- it's a basmati long grain rice with barberries. It's great with anything, but I prefer the Koobideh! 

I love saying Koobideh- but it's even better than it sounds! 

If it wasn't for the whiney 13 year old who wrote the review below mine, this place would be unanimous 5 stars. It earned every one.

I met Masoud the owner / chef when he was putting up the sign to the restaurant. Great guy- really cares about the food. High quality, everything is fresh and vibrant. One of my all-time favorite spots. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. The food is wonderful! It is truly done right.  If you have never had Persian food don't be put off, you should definitely try Pars."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. We had the koobideh and tahdig with ghorme sabzi. It was very yummy."}
{"text":"Used to like this place but very disappointed today.  They ran out of koobideh on a sunday (that's like McDonalds running out of Fries). After the server explained the situation she said same price for barg. Eventually we agreed (reluctantly). Then our server came back and said no, its going to cost extra and would rather us know than just give us a bill for more than expected (as if that's an option, surprise! $).

Our party of 6, some from out of town with strong cravings were about to head elsewhere.  We decide to speak to the manager who instantly confirms there will be no koobideh. My wife (who's Iranian) and i come frequently and expressed our disappointment.  My wife is fair skinned with light hair and doesn't always get recognized as Iranian. So... Her and the manager switch to farsi and not a moment after realizing shes Iranian we are told he can have koobideh ready in 10 minutes.  

About 10 minutes later, not a minute more, we were served what we had been asking for all along. Interesting right? Now you can form your own opinion from reading this. I know for us, we will be thinking again before returning or referring others and will be make a point to tell our Iranian friends about this story.  I couldn't be more ashamed and embarrassed for them over this experience especially after patronizing the business for many years prior. Bottom line, the food isn't quite like it used to be and apparently there are some other deep rooted issues as well. 

But hey, there's always Persian room."}
{"text":"Excellent, intimate mom and pop restaurant with friendly staff.
The lamb shish kebab, ghormeh sabzi and especially the fessenjan were all terriffic.  As was the barberry rice and the rice with limas and dill.  OK beer and wine menu to accompany the great food.  I'm glad this is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a horrible place!  I order a stew...little did I know it was going to be one of the most salty, tasteless meals I've ever eaten.  There was suppose to be Cilantro in the stew...there wasn't.  I ask for some and the waiter brings my parsley! He tells me they don't have cilantro, yet the menu clearly said there was cilantro. The owner sometime later came by to ask me about the meal, I told how bad it was...he said thanks and turned around.  My sister ordered a beef Kabob...menu price was $17.  The waiter asked if she wanted this or that. We get the bill, and her meal costs $25!!!  She thought the meal tasted good, but said she'd never go back again. We got the bill for $60!!!  With all their nickel and dime items.  I would never suggest this place to a soul...and the restaurant is empty...and there is a reason!"}
{"text":"One of the best Persian food I have ever tasted 
The place is very quite and the food is amazing 
Not to mention the very friendly service 
I will absolutely come back"}
{"text":"The food was so bad, i ordered Sultanii and the meat taste eww and  not cooked well and smells badz i spend 2 minutes chewing the meat. 
I dont recommend you to go there.
If there was minus 5 stars i will choose it."}
{"text":"I had never tried Persian cuisine before, but generally love Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavors, so I was intrigued by the new possibilities. My partner and I had pretty high expectations of Pars after reading so many positive reviews, but our meal was even better than we anticipated. 

The Pars Appetizer Platter sampler was varied, abundant, and outstanding, particularly the Shirazi salad (reminiscent
of a Persian pico de gallo) and the Olivieh salad, which combined chicken, potatoes, and mayonnaise in a deliciously unusual dish. The entree ground beef Koobideh kababs were succulent and well-seasoned, and the Basmati rice and Zereshk Polo rice side dishes were amazing. Despite having to take most of our enormous portions away with us, we still found room for dessert and really enjoyed sharing the Persian ice cream - rich vanilla enhanced with saffron, rose water, and pistachio. What a delicious meal!

Our server, Laura, was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly, and the interior decor was attractive, although we elected to sit outside. All in all, we were delighted with our experience at Pars and will return there the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Worst Persian restaurant I've been in my whole life! We had to wait more than an hour and half to be seated! The owner came and offered the appetizer then. As a custom, it should be complementary, but we were told we would be charged for it later. The waiter was really rude, too! Not recommended at all!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Nice seating indoors and out. Quiet though for lunchtime. We had the koobideh and the chicken kabob. Lunch comes with salad and rice as well as a grilled tomato. The food was great EXCEPT that one of the tomatoes clearly had mold on it and the chef/owner tried to say that the tomato changes to white/grey mold color when cooked. So not only did he give me mold to eat but then lied about what it was. 
4 star food but 1 star service from the owner
*disclaimer* our server was great however
...not sure if I should go back...should I?"}
{"text":"This place was a little overrated and defiantly not worth the price.  The chicken had the poultry flavor that I hate so much,  and if you want spices in your rice it's going to cost an extra $5. Who the hell charges $5 extra for flavored rice, it's not even organic rice nor is it made of gold.  The food is ok at best.  The only thing I really like were the appetizers, aside that,  save your money and the trip."}
{"text":"Gosh, I would love to give Pars Persian five stars, but it just doesn't quite make it.  Maybe 4.4 stars.   There were a few rough edges.  For example, the night we went the one mainstream fish item was not available.  The servers are friendly but pretty much what you would expect in a strip-mall restaurant, but the interior is 3/4 of the way to posh.  You can't worry about things like that when you come here.

As to the food -- I thought everything was very good to exceptional, but my wife found some of the stews only adequate.  This is more Persian than most Americans are used to in a Persian restaurant, and that is both its strength and its weakness.  My advice -- be adventurous, and if you don't really care for something, try something else next time.  And I think there will be a next time; in fact, for me, if the prices were just a few dollars cheaper (and they are not unreasonable at all), there would be many next times.  I could eat at Pars Persian every week and not tire of the food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I were supposed to be on a juice fast, but we walked by this place and caved. Their chicken and lamb Shish kebabs are insanely good! It's a bit pricey, but the portions are huge, plus you get unlimited pita bread!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood Persian restaurant. Huge portions. Love the eggplant appetizer, the hummus is to die for. My fave entree is the lamb kebab."}
{"text":"In a pinch while on my way to see Taliesin West I dropped in dressed for motorcycling and was greeted warmly by the host. I noted my hurry and was kindly recommended the Lamb Barg-Kebab ($20) for a popular entree that comes out quickly and went for it.

In under 15 minutes I had a to-go bag in my hand. When I got to my destination (after riding ~3 miles with the bag flopping in the wind!) I was very pleased with the quality. I will have to come back another time when I can sit down and enjoy a(n expensive) meal with a date.. The atmosphere and staff seemed pleasant, and I can vouch for the lamb kebab!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Persian cuisine... When the quality of Persian Room went down I had a hard time finding a good replacement to get my middle eastern fix... I went to Pars and realized that the chef from Persian room had left to start his own business PARS! Great place..."}
{"text":"This quaint family-owned establishment provides excellent service and delicious Persian cuisine.  I've been a regular patron for years and always look forward to dining at Pars whenever visiting friends and relatives in Arizona."}
{"text":"Best place in Arizona for Persian. I would know since I eat Persian food often as it is a part of my background. It is so delicious. I always share the chef's special which offers a mixture of dishes and is more than enough to share."}
{"text":"Stay away at all costs. It is an overpriced, under service and ambiance place.  Food was below average and the owner/waiter or whatever he is was rude and inflexible with the menu. So it is a pricey, no ambiance place, slow service, and belw average food. The Persian Room is a much better place."}
{"text":"Great good and great service. We loved the Tahdig with two toppings. It's was our first time here and we will be back for sure as we really enjoyed the Chef Special ! It was a real delightful experience !"}
{"text":"The food and service here was phenomenal!  There were 4 of us and we shared several combo entrees and shared \"family style\" so they we could all try a variety and every single thing was delicious and had a very distinct flavor.  There is something for everyone to enjoy.  We highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time here and being from Chicago and how picky and demanding we can be I loved this place. Came here with the parents for dads birthday. The place is smallish, but it does have a bar and a TV. Very very fresh food!!! The chicken is so tender and so delicious! They start you off with pita, butter, and sweet onion. I am super pleased and will definitely come back!

P.S you know the food is good when your leftovers taste amazing! Still fresh and tender after reheating!"}
{"text":"Restaurant looks nice, server was friendly but the food was terrible. The koobideh smelled very bad and didnt taste right. The barg was very sour and didn't taste anything like barg. The shirazi salad lacked flavor. The house dough was the only item that was good. I have been eating persian food all of my life and was very disappointed with the food here. Don't waste your time here. Go to Persian room instead. I will give the food 0 stars. The server and ambience 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was phenomenal! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  Very nice place.  We love their gyro, chicken kabob, kubide, appetizer tray and So many other things that we tried. The baklava is a must! !"}
{"text":"It was pretty quiet on a weekday, but we came in with a large group and everything was great. Wonderful service and solid lunch specials with lots of flavor and pita bread. I had the Zeresk Polo with Chicken and it was wonderful. I would definitely recommend it! I will have to bring my SO to try it soon."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a very late lunch here on Tuesday 2/19/13.  We arrived around 2PM, well after the usual lunch time.  I'm always a bit trepidatious about eating later than the usual meal times as the food quality sometimes suffers.  

Darius, the waiter was extremely pleasant and informative about the dishes.  We ordered off the lunch menu which includes a green salad with onion, tomato and cucumber and rice with the dish.  I had the Chicken Filet-Kebab with basmati rice.  I have to commend the chef on this dish.  It was well seasoned and they accomplished the trick of grilling the chicken and it was still tender and juicy!  Well done!!

My husband had the Salmon with Sabzi Polo.  The salmon was tastefully marinated in their own special sauce and was served with their Sabzi Polo rice.  The rice is basmati mixed with with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro.  Wonderful, wonderful rice!!  We both loved it.

They have an attractive patio so you can enjoy outdoor seating.    The decor indoors is tasteful.. not particularly exciting but acceptable.

We were very pleased with the food and service and look forward to dining at Pars again!"}
{"text":"This is a nice quaint Persian restaurant, service was excellent. The prices were a bit too high for the ambience, location, and quantity. The food was very good, however, we left satisfied and was pleased with the authenticity and taste. More affordable pricing and we will go back."}
{"text":"First, I'll start by saying that the food, once I was served, was good. Nowhere near worth the price. Certainly not worth the wait.

The only reason I came by here was that they have a sign proclaiming that they are mostly gluten-free. I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn't.

Now, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don't be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said \"too bad you can't have this.\"

Getting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.

The koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone. 

I then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.

If you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars. Get back onto Frank Lloyd Wright and drive west until you get to Scottsdale Road, then go north a little way and enjoy The Persian Room."}
{"text":"Delicious! The chicken sultani is very flavorful and the oyster mushroom kebob was perfect! The portions are large-we took leftovers home. We sat outside were it was quiet, but the inside had a nice ambiance as well. Wish I would have had room for dessert."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot for Persian Cuisine. The location is beautiful, the staff is absolutely wonderful as the food is full of real, authentic flavor. I've been to the Persian Room and a few similar spots but this can't be topped. I go often and will be back many times. A++ service."}
