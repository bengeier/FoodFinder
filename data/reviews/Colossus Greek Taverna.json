{"text":"Spent a relaxed and surprisingly quiet Sunday afternoon here.
The Taramaslata was outstanding.....the Souvlaki was authentic Greek while the portion size was truly North American!
Given the fact that there were only 3 other tables occupied the food took a while to arrive.....though it was well worth the wait.
One suggestion....if you want to retain the tables on the patio, please lose the plastic chairs...they are so out of place with everything else at Colossus.
Also if you must give candy along with the bill, please make sure everyone at the table can get one if they choose to. Minor lapse in attention to detail....which we have grown not to expect from this place.
Will be back for our next Greek fix."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great lunch.  Nice decor. I had a seafood penna pasta that was so good I almost licked the bowl. Good shared baklava to end the meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Best Greek food west of the Danforth, I probably go at least once a month. The decor is really nice and offers a Greek ambience. The saganaki(flambéed sheep's cheese) or any spread with their fresh grilled pita make great starters. Their lamb entrees are always good, but make sure you get lemon potatoes. They are so nicely cooked and gushing with flavor. For entrees, I recommend Youvetsi Aranaki (lamb shank), exohiko (pulled lamb and sheep's cheese in phylo), or if you're not adventurous any of their souvlaki is great. Finish your dinner off with some amazing Greek coffee. And if you have kids, don't worry they have a phenomenal children's menu. In addition to the food, the service is also top of the line. They are so friendly and they always remember you and sometimes even your last order. Each bill also comes with a Greek postcard and anise and cinnamon hard candies.Try to find a parking spot nearby if you can, but this can be a challenge. Also make a reservation when it is Friday or the weekend. Next time you're craving Greek, please give this amazing place a try!"}
{"text":"Charming little place, first downtown restaurant we've tried since moving into Oakville. She had the seafood salad which was a feast for the eyes and the tummy. I had the lamb souvlaki which was absolutely mouth watering, I can't wait to try it again. The service was excellent, food was outstanding and prices were very very reasonable for nice casual dinner out. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Food - try the Lamb Poutine, 
Great location - parking is easy considering most is on street
Great service, very friendly staff
i have been coming here for years, always happy and full when i leave"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service!

I've been here quite a few times as it is so close to home. The food is pretty good but the service seems to get worse and worse with each visit. The waiters are awfully slow and terrible at their jobs. They never come to check and see how your food was or to refill your empty drinks. We waited for about 15 minutes after being seated for someone to even come and greet us and take our order. The busboys provided us with more than our actual waiter. I would suggest ordering take out to avoid the poor and slow service."}
{"text":"My experience here is only based on take-out. I've never dined in.

I've been coming here for about 6 years now. It's my go-to place when craving gyros. Under 6 dollars for a pita sandwich filled with a delicious beef/lamb combo (generously piled on), seasoned tomatoes, the right amount of onions and tzatziki.

I don't live close to Port Credit, but will drive 15-20 min just to pick up dinner.

Good luck trying to get a seat on a Friday or Saturday night! After my many trips here waiting for my order, I know this place is busy!

I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the service is a little lack-lustre but not too bad that I wouldn't come back. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at about 5pm on a Wednesday. We were immediately seated and took time to look over the menu. Ordered the shrimp and scallop kabob and the lemon chicken breast. To our surprise the food came out quite fast, I would say less than 10 minutes. Even though it was prompt, I must say the food was far from great. Both our meals were quit bland in taste. Almost as like they just placed the seafood and the chicken on the grill and cooked it up and served with no spices or marinade. No taste or flavour whatsoever. The potatoes were quite salty (not sure if this is how they are made or not). However, I must say the greek salad and rice were very delicious. It was a shame the main feature of the meal was not on par with its sides."}
{"text":"Wonderful little family owned-style restaurant. My wife and I both ordered the souvlaki dinners because that's what we had a craving for, but the rest of their menu sounded very inventive and delicious (lamb Poutine and Greek feta & watermelon salad! We sat on their small, but very quaint and authentic patio. Their roast potatoes were delicious and their Greek salad was very nice as well. Plus, we found it very affoordable as well. Will be sure to come again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Oakville. We have been regular Colossus customers for years. Our latest visit was Friday night. Service was solid, food was fantastic and as always, Manny, the owner was friendly and attentive. 

I strongly recommend the saganaki (flaming cheese!), the pikilia platter, a selection of pita, dips, feta, olives, spanikopita and dolmades. 

For entrees you can't go wrong with the chicken souvlaki. But, if you are looking for something a bit different, try the rack of lamb. It is marinated in lemon juice, Greek herbs and spices and grilled to perfection. 

We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would actually give a 3.5 star rating. This is one of those restaurants where they just need to iron out a few things like efficiency. But the crowd the goes knows that the food is authentic and well done. Service is slow, but the staff are friendly.  I made a reservation on a Friday night and they were running behind. We had to wait 15 minutes still.  

I recommend the combination dip platter - you get to try all their break dips: hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki, salmon dip and another flavoured hummus? I can't remember but I ate more carbs and filled up knowing that I shouldn't because the entrees are huge.  The saganaki (pan-fried feta) is also a favourite.  They light it on fire close to the table, and sometimes the flames jump so high, you almost worry that the fabric hanging from the ceiling will catch fire! :) 

I love the way this place cooks their lamb. Either the rack of lamb or the lamb chops are delicious. The lamb is tender with a distinctive taste but not too gamey. The sides are okay, a bit bland - lemon potatoes and rice, which isn't a bad thing because it offsets the lamb.

This is the place to go for good Greek food in Mississauga (even if it's a little slow in service)."}
{"text":"The ambiance was lovely (they opened the front windows to expose the outdoors) and the food on a whole was amazing. 

The service however, was quite slow. The server took the appetizer order and did not return to take the entrée order until AFTER everyone was finished with the appetizer. The entrées took quite a long time to arrive (approximately 30 minutes). 

While the food was great, I didn't expect to be at dinner for over 2 hours on a Monday night. Unfortunately I missed my after dinner plans because of the delay."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the good. All courses were excellent. 6 plates everyone loved it. If we lived in Ontario we would come more often."}
{"text":"My high school was right by here, so we would run here everyday for lunch.  Now, probably because we were annoying high school students, the service wasn't the greatest, but my parents say that every time they go, the staff is lovely.  As a student I would always get the veggie platter, which included potatoes, side of rice and a greek salad.  The salad was always great and I'm actually craving the rice right now.  Just a tip for those non-students: The student rush is during 11:40-12:30, so its best not to go during those times!"}
{"text":"Fake greek food. Gyros are not real and frozen. Instead of chicken souvlaki they give you frozen chicken strips. Frozen gyro slices. What a joke and waste of money. Don't waste your time and money. I dont like when people advertise regular bad quality chicken as souvlaki in skewer"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The food has always been spot-on (I'd recommend lamb or chicken souvlaki, grilled calamari, or mousaka). The service has also always been fantastic. It's a friendly atmosphere, it's comfortable, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! But...the place closes really early for a restaurant. Many times we go for a late dinner and many times the waiter tells us the place closes in 5min! When its...9pm...
They have great selection of greek food and very generous portions too. I would only go for lunch though...
2- great food
3- rudeness and for closing too early"}
{"text":"Great food and service every time I've been there. Beautiful decor and ambience. My spouse and I have entertained several friends and family there. This is the best Greek restaurant for sure in Mississauga, and likely the GTA. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff. Everything is always fresh - by far the best Greek food around. Great location."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, very reasonable prices, atmosphere is cozy with some hustle.  Don't hesitate to try this place."}
{"text":"A truly great and authentic Greek restaurant in Oakville. I highly recommend Colossus!"}
{"text":"This place is a weekly must for my family. Food is amazing, spicy feta dip is delicious!  staff is great, atmosphere is very warm and family oriented. I've been going here for # years never once been disappointed"}
{"text":"Great souvlaki!  I also always order the grilled calamari.  It's so juicy and fresh.  The food is served very quickly."}
{"text":"Visited a few times during summer. The outside patio is always busy. The food, reasonably authentic, is very good. Portions will satisfy even a big eater.

They have this melted cheese dish....excellent. Forgot the name though. Their Redsina white wine is good. Won't give you a headache which is noteworthy.

Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Greek restaurant for seven years now and it tastes amazing every single time. Not once has there been a time when the potatoes were bland or the souvlaki was dry (though I'm vegetarian now). This is the place to go to in Mississauga for Greek food, and possibly the GTA, though I'm not that well acquainted with Greektown/the Danforth (yet). 

The restaurant's atmosphere is really nice and charming, it has the feel of a Greek Island, lots of white walls, mirrors and moldings, with wooden tables, wine racks and injections of color with artwork and flowers. The restaurant has a warm intimate feel, it is perfect for every occasion, dates, family dinners, a get together with friends. I just need an excuse to come here. The outside has a patio area as well. 

Now to the food, this is an ideal place for people who love their meat. I'm a vegetarian and I love this place so that says a lot for the restaurant. Everything is so fresh and tastes of the best quality, and the food is so flavorful. Do not skip the salads, especially the village salad. The staff is friendly, and knowledgeable, and the service is almost always perfect. No faults in this restaurant at all, except it is sometimes a little hard to get parking. A must stop if you are in the Port Credit area."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good but not great.  A little pricey I thought.  I've had better food for less at Mr Greek.  Excellent service and ambiance though"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant. I did. The place is really nice and ambience is great. But the food was just ok for me. We had the lamb souvlaki (which comes with rice pilaf and salad) and the kotomacaronada (chicken with spinach) and they were really nothing special. The food at Jimmy the Greek was better, I mean food there is not spectacular but at 1/2 the price, you're kinda ok with that. But when you're paying $16 for chicken and $17 for souvlaki (+tax), expectations are higher so..."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Good food, great staff. I tried the Grecian salad with chicken. It was delicious.  Everything we ordered was really good. I highly recommend this place if you're a fan of greek food"}
{"text":"This is actually a 10 star review. I take my girlfriend here every time we have a special occasion. The portions are MASSIVE and the food is good enough to serve to a queen, which is perfect considering my girl's my queen ;). But no matter how good the food is, what really makes the difference is the service. On a busy night when there is a line, the owner always settles us in with complimentary snacks to make our wait more comfortable. On my girlfriend's birthday last year, she was too full for dessert so the waitress brought us over a couple of traditional Greek aperitifs on the house! If you haven't gone yet I suggest you hurry up and get on that!"}
{"text":"Colossus is the best Greek restaurant west of the danforth. It's portions are generous and the cooks do a good job of maintaining consistency over time. I have been here many times and am amazed by at how good it always is. 

Good options are the saganaki, seafood platter or seafood salad, as well as the lamb.

The souvlaki is also good but I tend to pass on it because the other stuff is more exotic. 

Service is also good although it can get busy on weekend nights even with a reservation so it is not uncommon to have to wait 10-15 minutes for your table to be ready."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The atmosphere is cosy and intimate. It is one of those restaurants you can count on for an enjoyable  meal."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to Greek food heaven. Hadn't come for about 6 years because last time one of my guests faced an unfortunate barfing incident due to one of the alcoholic beverages. Those days are gone. 

Nestled upstairs on downtown Oakville's main strip, Colossus offers the BEST Greek food in Oakville HANDS DOWN. The deceivingly small entrance leads to a sizable and comfortable restaurant, tastefully decorated in typical Greek style. Lots of blue and white, but cool touches come out through iconic art, Greek word art and thoughtful placement of plants and mirrors. 

Great for kids. Super friendly and experienced waitstaff. Clean bathrooms. Great for groups. Saw a number of takeout orders too. 

Food was fantastic. Had the stix platter to share and we still had plenty to take home. Lots of wine choices. Baklava to die for served with warm honey and pistachio ice cream. Tons of krinos candies on exit. 

You'd do well to show up before the dinner rush to avoid the long lines. Plenty of free street parking after 6pm. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Went on July 13, 2013.  Excellent food!  Had the lamb.  Cooked and spiced to perfection.  Nicely decorated and friendly staff.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So, last night I went to this restaurant to celebrate my 19th birthday with my family. We had both appetizers and main courses all of which were excellent. Before the food we all had mixed drinks with myself trying a nice sangria.

Sadly I cannot remember all the Greek names but one was the Pikilia which was an assortment of various starters for us to share. We also had some panfried calamari and a dish of sauced sausage and vegetables. 

For my main course, I had lamb souvlaki wrapped in a pita which came with rice and lemon potatoes. My Grandmother had a seafood salad, my aunt some fish, my grandfather a rack of lamb, my mother moussaka and my uncle pork souvlaki. 

We didn't have desert but at the end of our meal they did bring us some complimentary shots of a fruity drink called by the waitress \"Greek Viagra\". All in all it was an excellent experience and a great end to my birthday celebrations. If it weren't for my living out of town I would gladly come often."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I started coming here about a year ago regularly.  as noted in my tip, try one of their Greek adapted cocktails, they are great with starters.  In particular I am a big fan of the Bloody Aristotle with its amazing dill flavour, and the Skinos Sour.  The Sangria is also very good.

My favorite dishes here include the Mousaka, the Saganaki and the Spetsofai.  I have also tried the \"Array\" which is a platter meant to serve 2, though in reality it can serve 3 or 4.  If you go with a small group order this along with some starters and you will have lots to choose from.

The service here is excellent! The staff are friendly with kids and provide useful suggestions.  They do a great job with take out as well, and I am actually going to use them to cater a party that I will be hosting this summer."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to soak up any sun I can get past 5pm. (^_^)

This Greek restaurant is facing the street so it's really hard to miss. There is parking in the back or at the front along the street. The inside looks really cozy, without any windows and tall bar chairs. 

The crowd is seemingly majority of locals &25% repeat loyal customers. It was my date's 7th time here. I had been here before to celebrate a friend finishing her med exams. For the life of me, I couldn't recall the place. So, to my surprise it was the same place. 

The staff are down to earth and very friendly. I noticed all the servers are male. The place has a casual feel to it. Nothing is fancy. Needless to say, It's the perfect place for a hearty lunch/dinner date. 

The patio here is a bit of a tight squeeze but lovely none-the less. When you enter the restaurant, turn left. It's a long way down with the tables all on the left side of the fence. The last booth/table has cushions on the seats. Mostly because it's against the wall. 

The portions are extremely filling and they start you with bread (white AND multigrain) , butter & balsamic vinegar oil right away. The oil is really good quality. 

Order: 
Melikithia - Bruschetta style mix with pita bread. The mix is fresh and light containing eggplant, tomatoes and garlic. 

Kotopoulu Lemenato : 2 large chicken breasts covered in a garlic,creamy alfredo-like sauce with Greek potatoes, pilaf rice and Greek salad. - The chicken was delicious. potatoes were amazing! Everything was perfectly grilled and succulent with the lemon sauce all over. The rice was soft and cooked well. It had long grains in between which made it even more appetizing. 

Kotopoulu Gemisto : Stuffed chicken with spinach, basil,red peppers and goat cheese. This dish was served with side veggies and dry spinach leaves. It was fantastic! 

I cannot speak highly enough of the food here. Want to impress a girl? -one that loves food? - BRING HER HERE!!

 Paid & walked away a desert happy girl - without any desert!  
MAGICAL SUCCESS!!

XOXO

{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time on New Years Eve. It was absolutely amazing! The service was a little slow, however this was expected given it was New Year's Eve. I had the chicken soulvlaki with extra tzitki sauce (amazing) and the watermelon and feta martini. It was DELICIOUS! The chicken was cooked to perfection and seasoned well without overpowering the rest of the accessories on the plate. The lemon potatoes were perfectly done. Will definitely be back soon and I can't wait to try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"This is another Oakville favourite. I brought my friends over for lunch this past weekend. The seated us in a booth tucked in the corner. It was very cute and quaint. 

They have lunch specials, full lunch spreads for $10-18. I got the lamb burger with Greek salad side. My friends ordered various items from the regular menu as well as a couple of glasses of wine. Our service was very attentive. The food was delish! 

Overall, it was a reasonable lunch, for an appetizer, 4 entrees and 3 glasses of wine, the total came to $120. 

If you are downtown Oakville, craving some great Greek food, head on down to Colossus!"}
{"text":"Love this place. As good as many places along the Danforth but a short drive and much nice atmosphere of the old Oakville lakeshore. This has been my prefered place for my birthday for the last 2 years running, it's that good!"}
{"text":"A little bit better most Greek restaurants in the Toronto area.  While the exterior is not very inviting, the interior is very nice. Service is also good. The menu offers a good variety. Everything we tried could use a LOT more flavour. The village salad meze size was huge and fairly bland.  The dolmades were way too heavy on the meat side and the moussaka was mediocre. This restaurant also offers a wide variety of seafood dishes that are probably worth trying."}
{"text":"Very good server. Great Greek Salad. We shared the Greek platter. Generous portion and good. We requested the meat be cooked medium and it came a little more on the done side, so consider ordering medium rare."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for a night out.

Had a good experience from beginning to end.

We were boring with our choices of food and choose to get lamb, and chicken souvlakis. We were impressed with our choices. We each ordered an alcoholic drink. All of them were made well. 

Although it was a busy night, the service was still great. Attentive but they did not overdo it. 

The food was delicious, great portions and good quality. 

Solid authentic Greek place to add to the list of food restaurants in port credit! 

Check this one out :)"}
{"text":"This is a great Greek restaurant. I'm Greek and I saw smelled and tasted great food like my grandmother would make. The octopus was very tender and full of flavor. I would come again in a heartbeat. Overall a great place to eat:)"}
{"text":"It was awesome. Lamb was tender and tasty. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We just moved to the neighbourhood awhile ago and we're looking for place to have dinner. We found this place and were very happy. It was one of the best Greek restaurants I have ever been. So fresh, so good... and platter for 2 that we ordered was huge! So coming back again."}
{"text":"Took a stroll around Oakville, Lakeshore and came here. We'd come here almost every time we walk around Lakeshore. It's definitely one of my favourite Greek restaurants. And arguably one of, if not the best Greek restaurant outside of Danforth. 
As we approach the door, there's a sign that stats Colossus is apart of Taste of Oakville. Which offers a pre-fixe menu. We glance through it and decide to order off of it. We ordered the saganaki cheese from the regular menu, because it's a must have.
I ordered the meatballs appetizer and roast leg of lamb dish. The meatball appetizer was outstanding. It was packed with flavour, resting on a bed of Greek Yogurt.
Unfortunately, for the main course, the roast leg of lamb was tough. I prefer lamb chops, but seeing as how I was craving for lamb and it already being on the pre-fixe menu, I took the chance. Never again. It was tough and didn't even taste like lamb.
I was full, so I couldn't eat my dessert. Which was the custard (Girlfriend got the baklava). So we took it home.
My girlfriend didn't like her chicken as the main dish, because she said it wasn't anything special. It tasted like something she can make herself.
The average lunch we had will not steer us away from this place. We'll definitely come back. Just will make better choices next time we come."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a sunday afternoon and had a delightful experience. Everything - food, service, ambience deserved five on five. 

For appetizers, We had spinakopita and hummus. Spinakopitas is basically a Greek savory pastry. The traditional filling comprises of chopped spinach, feta cheese, onions or scallions, egg, and seasoning. It was one of the best spinakopitas I have had. 

The hummus which tasted really fresh and the pita was really good. Hummus is something I always order whenever I eat out and very few places serve fresh tasting hummus which sucks because you can easily buy hummus at a grocery store so the only reason I want to eat hummus out is if it is freshly made. 

For main course, I had a lamb shank which was served over a bed of rice infused with aromatic spices and mixed with summer vegetables. 

Let me tell you just one thing, by the time I paid the bill, all plates were spick and span. 

I will definitely go to this place again. You should try it too if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"The fried calamari dinner is my go to. Always super tasty, fresh and excellent service. Gets quite busy so make reservations or get in early!"}
{"text":"What a gem in Port Credit - serving up GGC (Great Greek cuisine)!

Located on the East end of Port Credit's Lakeshore strip, this spot is a shining beacon that brings Free Greeks (and all other people) from all corners of the map!

It's a little cramped in terms of space and layout but this seems to be consistent with most of my Greek Restaurant experiences, but still surprisingly packed at Lunch on a Thursday. Is scored a cozy little

Love the bread they serve while you wait for your meal with Greek Olive Oil and vinegar to dip - reminds me of an Italian restaurant, except so obviously Greek! Yumm!

I was torn about what to order, and after explaining where I was stuck my server (who was lovely - a total mom) told me that the Gyro dinner was a lot of food and the other dishes I was considering wouldn't quite do the trick. Done!

Ordered the Gyro dinner which came with Greek salad, tzatziki server in a spoon (cool!), lemon potatoes and rice pilaf

The serving of Gyro was fantastic, so much meat - great value for your money ($10.95), the salad was one of the best Greek salads I've ever had, and the potatoes well... those were amazing also. I'm not usually a fan of the double carb meal but the rice was moist as well and I couldn't help to eat a half of what was given.

Price was so reasonable, I almost wanted to order more. Food was incredible, but I was so full!

This is my new GOTOGREEK #G2G spot in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Oh-Em-GEE!!! This place is SOoooooo good!!! Can I give them 6 stars? :) 

Visiting Toronto for a work trip and my colleagues and I were all wanting Greek on our last night in town. Man oh man. We were not disappointed! We had the flaming cheese and the sampler of dips, veggies, pita to start for the table of 5. Both were outstanding but that cheese was AMAZING!!!

Table ordered a variety of items from Greek salad with chicken, the soup, lamb dinner, and I had the chicken souvlaki. Everyone loved their dinners. Mine was outstanding. The chicken was cooked perfectly, lemon potatoes so delish and the rice was so flavorful. 

We ordered the little churro type flatbread for dessert and was a huge portion-- enough for our table of 5. 

Wish they had this restaurant in the states! Will definitely be back next time in Toronto. Service was really good as well."}
{"text":"We had the lamb and pork souvlaki dinners. There were other interesting items but we stuck with the usual.  For the price we were expecting some higher end food but that wasnt the case.  It was the regular tasting greek food from the food court. . The salad was fresh but the meat was over cooked.  The restaurant was a nice joint and patio was a good atmosphere. I would try other dishes if I were to go next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night. My boyfriend and I were out for \"date night\". The food was amazing, the atmosphere was wonderful and the service was quick and friendly. Great experience, will definitely return."}
{"text":"We sat outside on the patio on the Main Street. The strip has a lot of nice stores. The beach is nearby, great for an after dinner walk. The service was great - very attentive and speedy. Great food presentation. The iman baldi was really tasty and filling. The solomos was perfectly grilled. All dishes were modestly seasoned, delicately flavoured with olive oil."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!

I have only had take out from Colossus, but the staff on the phone and the service provided when I arrive is always amazing. The wait staff always smile and say hello even though you're just waiting for your order at the bar. 

I always order the meal sized Greek salad topped with grilled calamari. It is AMAZING. The portion is huge, there is lots of \"stuff\" on the salad such as feta, olives, tomatoes, etc. The salad dressing is delicious. The calamari is cooked to absolute perfection and not at all tough or rubbery. 

The price for two of the salads with calamari came to just over $40 which I was a little surprised about, but it was worth it! We will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"While my mother would consider this place to be a 5-star, I find there is still some room for improvement and am giving it a 4. The ambience and food seem very authentic, and while the prices aren't cheap, I feel that the value is still very much there. 

My mom raves about the lamb, so if you are a lamb lover, this is a good place to order it. I usually get the obvious choice of chicken souvlaki which is pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. 

As far as Greek restaurants go in this neck of the woods, I'd say that this is the best overall. Make sure to make a reservation if you are going during peak times since real estate is small and it can get quite busy."}
{"text":"RESERVATIONS REQUIRED!

I was dying to try this place, unfortunately, didnt know that without a reservation, you were out of luck.  So disappointed, since there wasnt a line of people waiting, nor any offer to wait or seat at the bar, maybe next time we are in Canada....."}
{"text":"Amazing place - good food, good service, and very ethnic Greek. 
Great location!
Great place for a family outing."}
{"text":"Snooty staff. Was deeply offended by the horrible service we received. Hostess was arrogant and made statements like, \"we are usually a reservations only restaurant, you are lucky we can for you in at all.\"

Not sure how she even had a job with an attitude like that. When I asked to speak to a manager she said no-one was available. Then some guy came up and claimed to be the manager's without even taking the time to respond to my complaints of bad service all he had to say was that a table was available. He was not truthful, however. No table  was available.

We left before we were seated. Won't be back. There's a better greek restaurant down the road with significantly better service."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time.  I think it been renovated and looks much brighter and modern than the dark grotto of yesteryear.

They have an assortment of cocktails with flavoured ouzos for the adventurous.  We ordered saganaki to start and grilled calamari and rack of lamb mains.

You get complementary fresh bread with a nice olive oil garlic dip.  Far better than that doughy typical garlic \"bread\" you get at some places on the Danforth.  Maybe it's been too long but that saganaki was amazingly good.  Crispy salty flaming cheese.  Kind of like a Greek version of raclette!

Mains - the rack of lamb was cooked exactly as ordered and came with roasted veggies and potatoes.  It was a delicious and tender lamb.   The calamari while cooked perfectly with a nice char to it was disappointing in that it or something else in the meal came in this weird sweet balsamic type sauce that, as far as I could tell slid off the calamari onto the uncle ben's converted rice and green peas and Greek salad below it.  The salad would have been better served in a separate bowl.  The rice was oddly sweet with or without the sauce and not in a good way.  The roasted potatoes that came with it were good firm tasty and almost made up for the sweet goo.

Friendly service and a nice patio in the summer make it a great place to dine.  Who needs to go to Greektown?!  Will try other items next time to see if I can rate it higher."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. We were very happy about the portion sizes. There were 5 of us and we had saganaki, fried calamari and escargot to start. The saganaki portion size is good enough for sharing, so if you have multiple sharing dishes you don't need multiple saganakis. They sear the cheese in a pan and do a \"fire\" show with it as they bring it out to you so that's interesting. Escargot is deshelled so you can just eat it without getting your fingers dirty. Main entree pasta portion sizes are pretty large and the seafood pasta was very good. I had the vegetarian Mousaka, which seemed like a small portion but I guess with the appetizers and complimentary bread I was very full in the end. We had the crepes to end the meal. It was good (pre-cut into three pieces so easy for sharing) but would've been better if served with some fresh berries."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and found this to be a great place for a social gathering. The menu is loaded with appetizers and salads, but has only a few entrees. I ordered the lamb souvlaki and it was delicious. It came with potatoes and rice. The whole table was served with several loaves of bread which kept coming throughout the meal. 

The prices weren't the cheapest, but it was a nice place for a meal and with great food. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"We dined here to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were not disappointed, as we were welcomed like old friends and shown to a table by our host. Water, bread and dips arrived promptly and we we read the menu. The menu is quite extensive and offers authentic Greek cuisine cooked in house.
I chose the Saganaki for my starter. This is pan seared goat cheese flambéed table side, and it is to die for. My wife had the Saligaria, escargot on garlic toast, beautiful prepared and presented. 
My main course was the lamb shank, Youvetski arnaki. This was an amazing treat and a lot more than I could manage; it tasted superb and the texture and flavour of the sauce and vegetables was most appetizing. My wife had the Mousaka which was piping hot and very good. 
We washed down our meal with half litres of Boutari Mosco, a Greek Pinot Grigio, and Paranga, a blend of red wine tasting reminiscent of a Malbec.
A complimentary desert of baklava was served complete with singing staff and a birthday candle.
Restauranteurs, if you want positive reviews and full cash registers - this is how to do it.
All the staff were personable, pleasant, and knowledgeable.
A great evening, and we will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding Greek restaurant, came after reading reviews and was not disappointed! Got the Chicken Souvlaki Lunch Entree and Feta Fries. The sides that came with the Souvlaki tasted quite fresh, along with great tatziki. Looking forward to trying more dishes in the future, as it's better than a lot of places in Greek town. Service was friendly too."}
{"text":"quality tastes good.  pork is tender.  portions are a little small compared to other greek restos.  i wish they would put some sauce on the rice.  overall i'm a fan."}
{"text":"The food here was tasty. 

I did not find anything particularly special on their menu. 

I would give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"All right so I was there Saturday night for a birthday dinner.  The only complaint that I have is that we were 6 people put at a table by the door that every time the door opened we froze.  

We started with a few apps.  We had the fried calamari and the saganaki.  Both were amazing no complaints

My main course was the lamb souvlaki its was cooked to perfection.  The rice and potatoes were awesome as well.  The salad lacked dressing but no biggie its only salad

Service was great.  If you are looking for a great Greek restaurant check this place out"}
{"text":"My family did catering from here for an event.  The price per person was decent at 11.50 per person.  There was a lot of leftovers after as the portions were very generous.  Included in the catering were tatziki, humus and baba ganoush.  That got finished up quickly.  Included in the catering menu was potatoes, rice, pork and chicken kabobs.  

The Cons: The meat was very mildly seasoned, and adding the tatziki to it made it taste even more bland.  The tatziki had no flavour.  The Pros:  The potatoes are seasoned amazingly and the humus, baba ganoush were very tasty with a home made taste to it."}
{"text":"Seated quickly and atmosphere and decor is beautiful. I wish I would've visited the washrooms first absolutely disgusting!!!!!! Women's as well. 
 We family of four ordered calamari. We order this all over at high end to medium scale. Restaurants. The calamari had no flour on it and very very rubbery. We ordered the platter for two. I left 3/4 of it there. Pork ones were still frozen and raw in centre,sausages overcooked , chicken sticks too small and dried up. 
 We left it all there. I was going to complain but I dint want to ruin ther business while they were busy. 
 Overall 150$ for that. I could've made this ten times better for probably $10. 
 Big big waste of money. Do not waste your time. 
Keith"}
{"text":"Tons of food ! 
I just ordered the takeout special and the pork souvlaki, pitas, Greek salad & tzatziki were awesome. The rice and potatoes were good. 
There's definitely enough food for 4 people and only $23. 
This will be the goto Greek restaurant in Oakville.

btw the staff and person that answered the phone were very pleasant."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  It has a very friendly and attentive waitstaff, nice atmosphere, excellent Greek food and reasonably priced!  I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Best sandwich I've ever had. I haven't had Greek food before, and was a little scared going in... totally amazing. Next time I'm in sauga this is where I'll eat."}
{"text":"The place is similar (but smaller) to the Oakville location in its quaintness, and peacefulness. 

The portions are nice, and served with a smile, however service is occasionally spotty in terms of attempting to get a hold of someone for additional items. 

Otherwise, great tasting Greek food, steps away from Port Credit - will repeat, if the need arises."}
{"text":"One of our regular dinner places over the past 5 years. Huge portions, prices a little on the high side but actually reasonable for Oakville. Service has always been excellent and friendly but sometimes they are just so packed there is no way around waiting; better to call ahead. The shredded lamb is always my favourite there, slowly cooked in pastry, amazing. The rest of the food is equally good but that lamb is something special."}
{"text":"Went for an impulse lunch, which unlike dinner isn't packed at least not at 1230. It also has a lunch menu if thats important to you. 
Had a great escargot and mushroom very shareable app. Yummy garlicky and tasty. I had the small pikila which is massive as was my friends kalamri lunch (salad rice potatoes tatsziki) it was huge!!
Service was friendly and prompt, definitely a good spot for a not to rushed lunch."}
{"text":"The chicken souvlaki today was dried up and fish was just ordinary No taste! Ridiculously priced as well! Felt so ripped off today :( 
Never again"}
{"text":"Went to Colossus with my gf and her brother Mike. Mike suggested this place as he often comes here as his go-to place for all occasions, birthdays, anniversary's etc. It's a special restaurant where you get treated like family. We had the most amazing spread which included Octopus, Shrimp, and Lamb Chops. Everything was perfect. As a side note, I tried picking up the bill but Mike beat me to the punch. So heres my tip if you ever go eat at Colossus, try to go with my GF's brother Mike!!! He told me no one pays when you go to his restaurant. Thank you Mike, thank you Colossus for the best Greek Dining I've had since I was in Greece! You guys Rock! I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited for lunch on Sunday, intrigued after noticing nice decor and seeing positive reviews. 

We both ordered the lunch meals - I got the spankopita and she ordered the chicken souvlaki. The lunch meal comes with potatoes, rice, and Greek salad. 

Food came 20 minutes after ordering. The spankopita was average (stronger spinach taste than what I've previously had) but the potatoes, rice and salad were very tasty - loads of feta cheese on the salad :)

Meals were great value given the quality, portion size and ambience ($12/each before tip & taxes)."}
{"text":"Colossus is One of my faves, I love the food, the atmosphere and the staff.
If you like Greek food, you need to try Colossus, we usually get a bunch of appetizers and share them accompanied by some wine of course.
I recommend you make reservations, very busy restaurant. 
Patio in the summer 
Take out anytime"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the waiter was uninterested entirely, no friendliness - very quiet and just basically dropped plates on the table and left. Nobody ever came back to ask \"is everything ok?\" after being served our food (it wasn't even very busy!). We had to *ask* for Tzatziki sauce (at a greek restaurant!) for our meal which came in McDonalds-ketchup paper cups that were very impractical. The lamb was not tender or juicy and the cut of meat didn't even seem like it was actually chops (does not look like any lamb chops I've ever had anywhere in the world). My wife had a fish dish that still had many bones in it. The calamari was bland and tasteless. The only redeeming feature of this place was the portions being large so I guess they're going for a \"quantity over quality\" kind of thing. Would not go again, highly recommend avoiding this place - you'll get better Greek food at a food court."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it all! Appetizers and main entree were very flavorful, just the perfect amount of ingredients. We had a platter that comes with diffent appetizers including red caviar with potato (soooo good), and for the main course my husband and I shared the lamb and sea dish. We left nothing on the plate!"}
{"text":"After an orthodox christening celebration,   we wanted some mezedes. My Greek cousin picked this place since it has a lovely atmosphere. The service was very nice, but unfortunately the staff was not greek. The dips were the least flavorful I have ever had. With other Greek establishments around, I would not return."}
{"text":"Ok Seems like Both locations are great! Well done, its the best Greek I have had in Toronto, don't believe the hype of Toronto foodie wanna be's , this is the BEST. Get of the TO self congratulatory bubble  get out of the line up in Greek town ( yuk) and head to Missasauga and Oakville and have the real deal. Not trumping you."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so good it's worth every bit of money spent!

When I crave for superb greek food I definitely go here since am near the area and it sure does fill up my tummy. Am giving it 5 stars FOR the food. Period. 

The service is quite slow at times but that's because it tends to be busy.. I don't quite mind it except when am really hungry it kind of irritates me. So that's a minus one. The staff is very polite though so I have no complaints.

Am not sure if some other people noticed it, but \"some\" of their tables needs upgrading.. it's unbalanced and I feel like it's about to crack at times. 

Anyway, the quality of the food is amazing.. how they cook their meat (chicken, beef, lamb etc) is on point. I always leave this place full and it's inexpensive for two people."}
{"text":"Ate there with friends past weekend. It appears to be incredibly popular, as the place was jammed. Not sure why. The food was just so-so (chicken souvlaki, spanakotiropita - spinach pie dinner). Lots of pepper in the spanakotiropita. Service was sloppy and really snooty. We made a wise decision to finish off the evening with coffee at Timothy's down the road. 
  
spinach + feta pie dinner"}
{"text":"We went here to sit on the patio on a Friday night as I had read many positive reviews about this restaurant. Unfortunately, none of the waiters were friendly and it took forever for food to arrive. Once it finally did, one meal was pork souvlaki with rice instead of chicken souvlaki with rice and potatoes. I found the chicken was ok but lacked flavour. I liked the rice and potatoes, but the Greek salad was small and barely had any dressing."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken souvlaki plate and wasn't overly impressed with the flavor of the food. It was a little bland. My expectations were higher after reading the reviews. 
I did order the chicken lemon soup as well and it was better than the meal. I enjoyed that!"}
{"text":"Just wow, always been outstanding as a choice for food in the \"mountains\". Try calamari"}
{"text":"Loveeeeee this place!!! Food is great and staff are friendly. My favourite Greek Restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here for a afternoon lunch event. The service was really great. Our waitress was always checking up in us and making great and funny conversation. The gentlemen serving drinks were quick and on the ball.  With regard to the food, we had a platter of bread with a variety of dips, feta, and grilled veggies. All of which was delicious! We also had grilled and fried calamari. The grilled was really great, good flavour. The deep fried, just your normal deep fried calamari. The main meal was lamb chops with potatoes and grilled vegetables. The lamb was a bit on the gamey side, but the veggies and potatoes were awesome!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! A friend and I discovered it in the summer in our wanderings around Port Credit. 
The last time I was there, I had the saganaki, (which was amazing) the lamb chops ( perfectly seasoned) and my friend had the rack of lamb(which was amazing). 
The bread they serve is warm and fresh with some olive oil and balsamic dip. 
I definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My first date with my gf. She chose the place :p

We ordered two souvlaki dinners. I had pork while she had the chicken. Generous servings, taste is similar to the greek restos at the danforth so don't bother going there just for greek food if you're from Mississauga. 

Could have been four stars but service was so-so so it was downgraded to three."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here on a Friday evening for a date night.  When we got there, all they had left were patio seats.  Bummer, as we would've preferred to have been seated inside.  Who knew you needed a reservation, huh?  Anyways, it wasn't too much of a bother as the weather was gorgeous outside.  I just think they could use some umbrellas or something because there was no hiding from the sun.

I opted for the chicken souvlaki and my partner got the pork souvlaki.  I ended up liking his pork better than my chicken that we swapped half of our meats lol.  I'm picky like that.  I cannot complain about any of the food.  It was SO good, not to mention A LOT of food.  You get a salad with feta, rice, some potatoes, tzatkizi and your meat.  Obviously too much food for me, that I had enough for a lunch the next day.  The feta was excellent!  So good on top of the salad.  The potatoes and rice were lightly flavoured just as Greek food usually is.  Nothing too strong in flavour.  The tzatziki was also great.  I get very picky with my tzatziki too, but they delivered pretty well on this.

I really wish I could give a perfect rating but our server was..meh.  He was there, he got everything we needed in a timely manner but there was just something missing.  Consider the rating 4.7 out of 5 lol.  This is probably the best place for Greek food in Port Credit."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and both times loved the food and the ambience. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hidden Greek resto gem! I feel like Port credit carries most of Mississauga's best restaurants! 

This place is very cute! A great place to go for a date or have a great family lunch or dinner!

The servers are very nice but I was a wee bit disappointed to find out that they don't serve the gyros during dinner. I was looking forward to it too :(. Nevertheless we started with the stuffed kalamari with crab, tomatoes and scallops and it was really good!! The kalamari was right at the point of almost being overdone but taken off the grill just in the nick of time!  Squeezed fresh lemon juice and omgg... So nicely done! 

I ordered their chicken rice souvlaki dinner and my date had the pork souvlaki! The chicken was very tender and flavorful! Salad was crisp and fresh, the rice has some orzo in it and it tasted good, the potatoes were tender and lemony! Mm! The pork souvlaki had bonus points for taste but a little to overdone for me. 

We finished off with their Ferrero Roche cheesecake, so delicious!!! I could do without the chocolate drizzle but I didn't mind! 

I highly recommend this place if your looking for something that's easy on your wallet for a big portioned meal!"}
{"text":"Lol , chicken souvlaki wasn't bad ..but flat soda and the fact that I found a mouse in this restaurant..will never go again ."}
{"text":"This place is no Astoria but it isn't bad. Colossus is a Greek fine dining on Lakeshore. The outside doesn't look like much. Infact, the blue door can be quite cringeworthy. But the inside of the restaurant is quite lovely - cozy, intimate, a little old on the decor and the feel - I especially love the seating near the window overlooking Lakeshore. There's an ancient iron portable fireplace near the window, which is quite nice on a cold winter day. 

The food isn't bad. The portions are massive and the prices are very reasonable. I ordered a Pork Souvlaki. It was good - however, I prefer a more tender meat. Maybe I should've gone for the lamb instead. My friend ordered Greek fries; we were disappointed that they weren't the special cut Greek Fries - instead, normal fries with a feta dump on it. 

One of my main complaints about this restaurant - the servers did not check on us. We had to ask for water; and then repeatedly ask for refills. I get it. Fine Dining = Wine. And sure enough, we had two massive wine glasses on our table. But, we just weren't in mood for wine at 5pm in the evening when it was still light out. 

Another one - the host. We walked in hoping to be seated. And instead of signalling to us (he was on the phone), he turned around and chatted for 5 minutes - with his back to us. Not professional fine dining etiquette. 

Point to be noted - although the restaurant is Greek, most of the cooks in the open kitchen seemed Indian. Our server was Indian as well. Not that I am trying to diss my own race, but I quite enjoy places that maintain authenticity by hiring pro chefs or Greek cooks. And lovely, cherub, Greek servers."}
{"text":"Had the homous and spicy feta dip with pitas tonight for dinner. Delicious!!  Would definitely have it again."}
{"text":"We have come here about three times over the past 6 yrs. ( 4 hr drive for us) the first time I had this lamb dish with dill sauce that I just died when I tasted it, amazing couldn't wait to go back again. The next time a few years later the dish was off the menu but they made for me anyways and I was seriously happy. So yesterday when we were in the area again we had to go.  The dish I was told was popular but not on the menu and also told it was a special on the menu this summer. Had the lamb kabobs it was o.k but nothing special. Why not make the customer happy or offer another sauce ? My point is there is no reason to go back again. Why get ride of something that made them unique and special? I can get Greek in my city just the same, very sad such a good thing had to end."}
{"text":"I go here whenever I want a great meal and great service. I like everything form the chicken to the lamb souvlaki. The Gyro is really good also. Service is always good and quick for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best meals ever! Top 5 at least! Had the Lamb Chops with Roasted Veggies and rice pilaf.  I think the roasted/grilled red pepper, zucchini and broccoli along with the specially roasted/baked potato, were the stars of the meal. The bread with oil and balsamic along with the red wine...Awesome!...Oh ya, the lamb chops were perfect as well...Wow! I can't want to travel back to Toronto/Port Credit area! Makes a business traveler very happy to stumble across a diamond such as this!"}
{"text":"I suggest for the owner to reduce the size to 2oz of the underseasoned  lamburger and increase the price to $25 and your profit will skyrocket!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food here . Patio is nice . Service is amazing. food was great!! My favourite there is the rack of lamb. I also enjoyed the saganaki."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times in the past. While the food has always been good the service has always been average. When I went in for takeout yesterday I saw that service had dropped to abysmally low standards. The wait staff listlessly tried to guess my order and when I tried to correct her she walked away. One of the male staff took my order without ever making eye contact. Overall while my food was tasty, the staff was apathetic and disinterested. Everyone looked grumpy. Maybe I was mistaken for one of the many students who were also getting takeout, but that's no excuse. I live in Toronto and could get better tasting food with much improved service on the Danforth. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Its always a good sign to see a packed restaurant on  Tuesday night.

Wonderful service, everyone works as a team and the attitude shines through.

We were served bread with olive oil and balsamic to start off.

I ordered my favourite starter Saganaki , which itself has a beautiful presentation. It is fried sheep cheese with a squeeze of lemon.

For my main, I got exohiko, which pulled lamb, spinach, onion in a philo pastry served over rice.

My friend got the mousakka, small delicious bowl covered in cheese.

Didn't order any drinks or desserts. Water was only filled up once. 

Can't wait to return back and order something different!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but I remember going to their other location in Port Credit in Mississauga. My husband and I ordered the spanokopita as an appetizer, which was flavourful. We also shared the chicken souvlaki dinner since we wanted room for dessert in the area. The chicken souvlaki itself was good but came with only 6 pieces and half a plate of rice, potatoes, and salad with little dressing. Now for almost $20 for the chicken souvlaki, the chicken portion could have been bigger because we got the same portion and quality as a combo at Mr. Greek for half the price. At this price, you're really paying more for the ambience. I remember the portions being bigger at the other location a while back. I'd be open to trying other items at this location in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! I always get the grilled calamari plate when I come. The staff are okay but the food is always delicious. The location is small and many tables are right by the entrance so it is a bit annoying if you get seated there. Besides that I have always enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"My favourite Greek restaurant! All ingredients are super fresh. They know how to cook lamb so it melts in your mouth.  Amazing lemon potatoes too.  Definitely a must try, but not cheap."}
{"text":"Adore the atmosphere and loved the service. Seems like such a hidden gem that you don't wanna tell many people about because you wanna keep it to yourself. It's the type of place you impress a date with."}
{"text":"First off the portions were huge!  I got this chicken dish that was stuffed with feta cheese with potatoes and red peppers on the side. The chicken was marinated well and the potatoes were perfect. For an appetizer, we got a spinach pie. It was as flaky as it was tasty, and believe me it was HELLA FLAKY!  They gave bread as a starter with 2 dipping sauces, one garlic, and the other a vinaigrette. Both complemented the bread perfectly. The ambiance was totally lax and peaceful. The service was attentive. Reasonable price point.  ONOLICIOUS TO DA MAX. WOULD COME BACK! HO!"}
{"text":"Food - 2.5*, Service - higher

I've been wanting to go to Colossus for a while now, so I jumped at the chance when a gf suggested Greek for lunch!

The restaurant itself is cute and quaint.  Service was friendly, patient, and prompt.  All good signs,

BUT

In all honesty, I was quite disappointed with the food.  To test out the restaurant, I ordered the staple Greek meal, Pork Soulaki Entrée.  Prices were quite reasonable at $10.95 which included a coupla large potato pieces, rice, Greek salad, and the meat.  Good portion at a great price point!  

All the staples, re:  potatoes, rice, & pork were dry and bland.  In addition, rice was slightly undercooked and seemed like it was left sittin' out (dry).  There wasn't any sauce with the potatoes.  And the pork was overcooked (dry).  Everything needed a bit more salt and I am not a sodium addict.  The flavours were almost there, but lacked something.  My dish didn't come with a lemon wedge, so I wasn't able to liven things up.

I've had better at the mall food court.  Salad was fresh tho'!

Since the service was pleasant and setting was pretty, esp. at night, I'd give them another chance.  Maybe they were having an off-day?"}
{"text":"Colossus was packed with local students during the lunch hour, so it probably best to visit after 1 pm.  And \"souvlaki\" sounds lovely with a Canadian accent. 

The village salad is a good idea, especially the feta.  The tomatoes may be the weakest part of the salad, which is strange considering that this is the Land of Tomatoes. The greek fries are akin to steak fries, and were good.  The spinach pies were also quite good, especially with the tzatziki, which has the perfect amount of dill.  

I would pass on the cold eggplant salad.  It wasn't great, and the pita costs 0.95 extra (that is a bit petty). The bread basket at the beginning of the meal is also a pass.  

There's a small parking lot and metered street parking, which seems to be vigilantly enforced. 

For a quick lunch on your way in or out of TO, it's a good option!"}
{"text":"6 of us went for dinner here last night.
I had the \" rack of lamb\" and asked for it to be done medium. It was perfect!
My friends had souvlaki ( pork and chicken) and another had a special for the evening; a seafood paella. We all loved our meals.
The reasons for the 4 out of 5 stars was the Baklava. It was syrupy just like I enjoy it but it came with some fruit poured on it that looked like carrots and potatoes.
Also they screwed up our reservation; it was 6 people for 7:00 and not 7 for 6:00 but they did manage to accommodate us quite quickly despite being a very busy place.
Reservations are a must. 
Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Packed packed packed. Make sure you make reservations!! Parking is in the rear of the building, limited spaces. Loud venue, and depending on where you sit, very limited seating space.  

Service was a mix. We were seated beside a table receiving nothing but special treatments. You name it: free shots, free dessert and extra extra attention. I guess they frequented the establishment. And there was us, can't even get our waters refilled. Hmmm... I will update you after my 100th visit. 

Food was a-okay. We were greeted with bread. We ordered the seafood platter, the spanakopita, and of course,  saganaki. Food portions was decent. Nothing amazing about it. 

Overall verdict. Ya, I will go back, maybe."}
{"text":"Went to place for my girlfriend's birthday. It was a Friday night (family day), we just walk in without a reservation... which I suggest everyone to make one if you're going in the near future.
Everyone looks very trendy that night, and we're just poor students wearing some decent clothes. But the waitress serves us nicely, so I like the service in this place.

They first gave us a plate of different kind of breads and two dips of olive oil... jesus, those are the best olive oil I've ever had!! I can survive the whole school year with just eating that... LOL 
I'm a huge seafood fan, so I ordered a Medterranean Mussels for CAD 11.95 which I think it's a bit pricy for an appetizer; then I also ordered a Lamb Souvlaki, then lamb is perfect the dish is delicious... but the salad has so much feta cheese in there which destroy the salad, but then this is the traditional greek salad?... cause the salad was literally drowning in feta cheese, and it was too strong for my taste.
And my girlfriend ordered a Exohiko, I took a bite and it was a bit spicy, and she finished her food, while I have trouble finishing mine. But she is so FULL after that.

Their food portion is HUGE... I don't consider myself as a small-eater, but BOY! That meal was huge!! I would have walk back home afterward to help digesting my food, if wasn't my girlfriend was too lazy. LOL!
I would rather they make the portion smaller and lower the price for a bit, that would be great."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've had in a long time. Went here during a business trip in the area. The watermelon salad was wonderful and the Greek Paella was extremely good. Full of seafood and protein with a very tasty tomato sauce throughout."}
{"text":"Now that I've been here for dinner twice, I feel like I have a pretty good feel for the place.

Overall my impression of this spot is similar to other Oakville restaurants - a bit too expensive for what it is, and service that is a bit too casual, but overall a decent meal. 

The meal starts with a variety of breads with two dips, a delicious olive oil and an oil with garlic. The wines are decently priced, which is a point in Colossus' direction. 

Both times I've been here I've had the souvlaki, once chicken, once pork. The chicken was far better in my opinion, the pork was a little dry. They come with a mountain of rice, potato, and salad, but only a teeny spoonful of tzatziki sauce, which isn't quite as much as needed. 

Overall, this place is pretty decent, but not even close to what you can expect in Toronto for the same price."}

{"text":"Wow! What a great/lucky find. It was a busy Mother's day brunch afternoon and there were 6 of us + a toddler - finding a nice Mother's Day lunch was going to be tough! We stopped into a couple of places on Lakeshore that marched us right back out. On our third try, we were met by some really friendly staff and lots of great sights and smells at Colossus. We were quickly seated in a pretty full restaurant and enjoyed a great time and a great meal. All of us enjoyed the various mezze and entres we ordered and the great service that came along with the food. Would definitely stopp by Colossus next time I'm in Oakville!"}
{"text":"Colossus is a cute little spot, easily detected by its Mediterranean colour schemes. The charming decor carries inside with the stucco walls and photos of the old country (not mine).

The bread basket and balsamic dip is brought out promptly.  This is a nice touch even though the bread is of the store-bought variety. The menu is studded with classics like souvlaki, gyros and some great looking lamb and seafood dishes. The unofficial signature dish is the mousaka. The kitchen is consistently pumping them out in their little clay pots. 

Prices are in the neighbourhood of $10-20, which is quite reasonable. This is the place to be once the patio is up and running."}
{"text":"it's one of my favorites in oakville. the seabass has always been amazing every time. i love the consistency. ive also had the  lamb tenderloin and grilled veggies which was  very good. the tezik sauce is one of the best ive had probaly cause its so creamy...but lately the roasted potaotes have been rubbery i suspect its been sitting around for awhile. service is excellent and it's a nice spot to take a date. the place isnt very big but they do accomdate large groups because the floor plan is very narrow."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Tzatziki is very fresh. Homemade fries are delicious! Will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the outside tables -food is tasty, traditional Greek.I have always been pleased every time I have a meal at Colossus."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! Went on a Saturday night with a couple of friends. It gets very busy so I would recommend making a reservation in advance. 
We shared some appetizers and drank Greek beer. Everything was delicious! And the portions are big. We had the Pikilia, which comes with assorted spreads, pita, feta, olives, stuffed wine leaves and the spinach pastry. We also ordered the salmon-wrapped asparagus and the mussels, but our favourite was the Pikilia, it's perfect for sharing and you get to taste different Greek plates.
Service was amazing and the hostess was lovely. We'll be definitely going back to this place."}
