{"text":"I ate here for the first time the other day and the service was very fast and friendly. They have inexpensive happy hour rolls all day which were delicious! I got a Philly roll and spicy tuna roll and it was actually spicy and flavorful. I usually think spicy tuna rolls are too mild but this one was great. Will definitely be returning soon. Worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good, nice small place. We had the $35 sushi boat which was a good deal, the only downside was that you AREN'T allowed to choose either of the two \"special rolls\", 5 sushi pieces or 9 pieces of sashimi. I would give this place another shot though."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh sushi. Casey the owner and chef is a great guy that seems like he has a real passion to make each roll special for each and every customer. It is a hole in a wall but I don't care what it looks like.. It is clean and good food! Highly recommend... My favorite food is sushi and I am picky! Great prices too! Please check it out. He will make a roll to your own taste too!!!"}
{"text":"Like the 5 star says \"As good as it gets\" this is the best sushi place anywhere as far as I am concerned. Great staff, great sushi chef and amazing food.  They have the best FRESH Sashimi hands down which come with \"Fresh\" wasabi not the powdered kind complimentary. If you love UNI they have the best most fresh call ahead to check on the delivery date it goes quickly !  I recommend the garlic roll with Yellowtail and the Superman burrito YUM I'm drooling.  I send everyone here and it becomes their favorite place as well I joke with the owners they are going to need a bigger place :)"}
{"text":"2nd time here, better than the first time. Staff is great, food is fresh. If your thinking of sushi, don't pass up this place."}
{"text":"I came to Glendale to check out the Midwestern campus for school. I come from the San Francisco Bay Area and one of my favorite comfort foods is good sushi so I knew that if I came here for grad school, I would need to check out the local sushi spot. After finding this local spot, I knew I needed to support this place and write a good review even though I hardly ever write reviews.  So, after touring the campus, I looked on yelp and found this place. I drove around. It's a little hard to find. There's an electronic sign above that says Sushi. It was in one of those little shopping centers, but not a big one. At least there's free parking.   Walking in, it was completely empty. It was a Tuesday night. I found simple chairs and tables, but there was also bar with the sushi chef standing behind it. Immediately, (probably because I was the only one there) the chef and the hostess greet me. I'm pretty sure they are a married couple.   They directed me to sit at the bar. I usually always try and sit at the bar because I love watching the chef prep the food, but I told them that I had been out all day and was in desperate need to plug my phone in and charge it. They laughed and the wife directed me to one of the other tables that had a plug underneath and I finally started charging my phone. There was a flat screen tv up in the corner displaying the NBA playoffs.   So, I sat down and immediately I start talking with both the chef and his wife. Well, I'm kinda yelling back and forth with the chef since I'm not sitting at the bar and they start asking me about how I found the place and all normal small talk stuff.   I went on to explain them that I was in the area only for the day and wanted to decide whether or not I wanted to go to school in Phoenix. They talked to me about their experiences and where they had lived and so forth and how they had adjusted to living in Glendale. Supposedly, the sushi chef used to be a pretty popular sushi chef in Las Vegas but wanted to open his own place, or something like that.   Well, I finally got around to the menu and noticed the prices. I guess they have only been open for about 2-3 months so they had happy hour specials all day. Very reasonably priced for sushi.   I however can be a bit of sushi snob and didn't order the rolls and went straight for the sashimi bowl that had a couple of different types of sashimi plain. Sashimi is just the raw fish by itself, usually over some daikon root (which is edible and good for you!). Along with the sashimi bowl, I ordered some tea and some miso soup.    The soup came first and it was delicious. Not too salty. The pieces of tofu could have been a little bigger, but there were plenty of them.   The tea came shortly after and it was piping hot. I know I know. Who orders hot soup and hot tea when it's 100 degrees out. Well, they had the AC going strong and for me, sushi is always weird if I don't have tea and miso soup.   The tea was delicious. It was definitely something not out of some random lipton's tea bag, but it it was loose herbs that were being steeped in a steel bowl on top of the tea kettle that came out.  Then the sashimi bowl came out. I was a little anxious because I was concerned about the quality of the fish. Like I said, I live in the SF bay area where there are lots of good quality sushi houses and I guess I've been a bit spoiled. But, Sushi Catcher totally exceeded my expectations. Along with the sashimi bowl, I also got a bowl of sushi rice and also some real wasabi (with the chives and stuff).  Salmon: very delicious Yellow tail: delicious Octopus: delicious white fish: delicious shrimp: average tuna: below average Sushi rice: delicious (it's surprisingly difficult to have good sushi rice)  I actually loved the salmon so much, I ordered an additional bowl of salmon sashimi.   I took my time eating my meal since I really didn't have much planned for the evening. Other diners drifted in and I continued to watch the basketball game, chat with hostess when she wasn't busy with the other customers, and slowly drank my tea.   I enjoyed the tea so much, I asked her to refill the kettle with hot water so I can enjoy the last dredges of the herbs she placed inside. She gladly did this for me.   Of course, went to the bathroom because of all the tea. Bathroom is located in the back and it was standard. Clean though, but nothing hugely impressive.   So, after relaxing for I think a total of two hours, I decided I finally had to pay the bill. With the amount of sashimi I ate, I was definitely expecting something expensive, but it was pretty cheap, at least by sushi standards. So I just tacked what I thought I should have paid and gave them a huge tip since they were so helpful and welcoming and answered so many of my questions about living in the area.   I will be back in the fall when my program starts and I definitely foresee myself coming here as often as I can afford to gorge on salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"First time here and i was amazed. The sushi was delicious and the sizes were huge. Would easliy recommend this place to anyone. Worth a drive."}
{"text":"Our favorite local sushi spot.   Awesome staff and great suchi.    Happy hour is our fav time to go. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The quality of the fish here is superb compared to other sushi places in Glendale. The sashimi is cut nice and thick and you can taste the sweetness and freshness of the fish. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and portion size, they don't try to pile on the rice in your rolls so they can be stingy on fish like other sushi places. The best part of coming here is that they always give you a little something extra. We've gotten extra sashimi, free uni, mochi and fruits! It varies each time but it makes coming there extra fun! The restaurant itself is not fancy, very simple decor but clean. I've lived here for 2 years (having grown up in Orange County) and this place has definitely become my go to place for sushi. Definitely go here if you're a sushi snob, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure if the owners have changed but The food quality is not the same. I have eaten since they opened. Was my wife and I favorite place. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"The Sushi Catcher is clean and the staff is friendly.  The sushi is great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Did we all go to the same restaurant?After reading these reviews it was decided that we needed to go try the all amazing Sushi Catcher. When we got there we were excited to eat the food. Everyone raved about the happy hour menu, so naturally that was the first place we looked. But the pricing just didn't make sense. I understand that every business is going to need to make a dollar, but why even offer a happy hour menu but only take $1 off the rolls?   We had decided on our rolls and she got a Tootsie roll, and a California. I got a Sunflower and a Salmon Skin roll.   The sunflower was meh. Nothing I would ever order again. Salmon skin, a very easy roll, was okay at best. Nothing that impressed me.   In her words \"They f***ed up a California roll. How do you fuck up a California roll?\"  The tootsie roll was fine for her, but now 12 hours later she is vomiting and has terrible diarrhea. Being that this was the last food we ate in the day prior, we are convinced this gave her food poisoning.   I have never taken the time to write a Yelp review... It was just bad. Would not reccomend it at all."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley! Don't let the hole-in-the-wall facade fool you. This place is a class act. Friendly and speedy service, all-day happy hour, fresh, authentic, inexpensive, and delicious. Will now be my go-to for sushi."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch by myself and it took almost 30min to get my food. To top it off the rice and house salad that went with my bento box they forgot and I had already got my main dish. When I got my check they still paid me full price! Needless to say the food was good but not worth going back AT ALL. Poorly organized, cramped space, and poor service...."}
{"text":"Update - this place has gotten even better since my review nearly a year ago. Their all day Happy Hour can't be beat. This place is always spotless, and the staff always smiling. Presentation of sushi rolls is clever and sophisticated. Hubby's and my favorite rolls are the spicy tuna (perfect spice level and VERY generous tuna mixture), the tootsie (excellent, now that the cream cheese amount is lessened and the eel sauce dotted on the plate is the precise amount necessary to give it that extra special flavor), and the shrimp tempura roll (shrimp is so fresh). The sushi rice, the wrappers, all the ingredients are SO fresh. The wasabi is superior to many of the sushi restaurants we've tried, and I love the fresh pickled ginger.   Hubby and I agreed - there is no reason at this point to have sushi ANYWHERE else in the northwest valley than here. We're hooked!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner here!! The sushi was fabulous and prices were great.  Highlights included the volcano sushi, the seared ahi, fried calamari and the flavorful spicy/garlic edamame. Plus yummy Mochi for dessert-the strawberry and mango were my fav. Cute and cozy inside with great music.  Talked with the owner and she is very nice and so knowledgeable about sushi.  Will definitely be back.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just go to Yellowtail Sushi instead. Much fresher and better made than this overrated hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"Went here based off reviews. Everything was mediocre at best. Will not go back. Have no problem it's just some hole in the wall location usually that's were I've found some of the best eats but this place was honestly equal to or worse then the major sushi chains."}
{"text":"Okay it is official NO MORE KC AND SUE!! They sold the business and the new owners the sushi is baaddd. Anyone know if KC and Sue are opening another place?? If not the search will be on once again for the best sushi in town. The \"New Sushi Catcher\" is not even a shadow of the old thumbs down..:("}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Already visited a second time."}
{"text":"This place is our sushi spot! Anytime we want sushi we go here! Nothing fancy just good service and good sushi! My husband and I are regulars here and when u order they bring you a free cucumber crab salad thing, not sure the name. Try it it's yum!!!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting and waiting for our first sushi roll and it has been 50 minutes. Service is quite garbage so I don't consider this being worth it even if the sushi is better than average for the area. There are dirty plates that weren't cleaned up from the previous party sitting at our table.   All day happy hour is a gimmick since the specialty rolls aren't discounted at all. $4 California rolls should be standard price regardless of happy hour since it's as simple as it gets.   Very mediocre service and still sitting here starving at the hour mark as I post this review."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing , I get my tattoo work done right down the door and never knew it was there . It's kinda of a hole in the wall place but don't let that stop you from trying there sushi . Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time here and will be back for sure, sushi and sashimi was fresh and appetizers were on point. Service was great and friendly. Free edamame with a check in was definitely a bonus. Recommended!"}
{"text":"So I'm giving this place two stars because the service was good. They were polite and appreciative of our business and the sushi was okay... I've never been to a sushi place that has deals going on that I specifically have to ask for. Usually they just know their menu or would clarify. We ordered two rolls off the lunch menu which should be 7.50 for both and then an additonal roll. With the lunch menu you are supposed to get miso soup. We did not receive that. So I had a bad feeling we weren't going to see any type of special on our receipt and sure enough I was right! They also seemed super concerned about the thermometer in the case where the fish was... I saw the guy check it a few times and heard him say it was okay. But it does concern me and would hope if there would be some sort of health issue going on they would say something...but again that's purely on good faith which might be a dumb decision on my part. I'm not really sure as to why this place was rated so highly the sushi at yen sushi is way higher quality and I've never had to refer to any special of there's they just automatically know what rolls are on what special."}
{"text":"Love Sushi Catcher! Great price, always fresh ingredients and high quality food!! The happy hour menu items are a great way to start the meal. It is our go-to place when craving sushi."}
{"text":"We were out and about and decided to have Yelp choose our dining location. The kids wanted sushi, so we looked for a highly rated spot. Glad that we were able to stop by Sushi Catcher. At first glance the location and tiny spot they occupy can have you thinking twice. Things are crammed all down the hallway to the bathroom. If you can get past all that (once you taste the food you should) then this spot will create happiness in your belly. Very simple menu with lots of creative choices. We settled for your basic rolls and bento box. I decided to try the Jalapeño bombers. I can't recall all that was in it, but with the Sriracha I added that was on the table, these things were good! Service was quick and prices were moderate. This is a good spot and when in the area we will return."}
{"text":"What a fun place! I wanted to try a new place on my birthday and I love sushi so the reviews at Yelp steered me here. The staff there were the friendliest group I've met in a while. It was more like going to a friend's house to eat than a restaurant. The sushi chef has a great sense of humor and surprised us with some great and very nice-looking sushi.   The best parts: The food was super-fresh. Everything tasted like it was prepped that same hour. They gave us free (delicious) cucumber and crab salad and even handed us some sea bass to try as well.   What was really cool was the rolls actually looked like what they were named for. I had the Caterpillar Roll and the chef took the time to arrange it so it had a wiggly caterpillar shape and even had an identifiable 'head' and 'tail'. Very cute! And extremely tasty. Best one I've had. I'd say more about the chef's clever way of arranging sushi in fun patterns but you should just go see for yourself. And if you really want some fun, ask him to surprise you with his favorite."}
{"text":"Was looking for new Sushi place ... pro / cons  (1) Food was reasonably priced and portions large (2) Sushi was good tasting  (3) Service was lacking.   I gear service on how long my water glass is left unfilled.   It was never filled for the entire evening.   I also asked to do a take out order, the waiter said he was ready, I gave it to him ... 10 minutes later he came back and said ... I need to write it down, I didn't get it the first time.  (4) It seems a lot of regulars were there when we dined.   They were given a lot more attention by the staff then we were.   Hard to become a regular when a newcomer is ignored."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find good sushi on the west side of the valley, been to most places like Tokyo lobby, fresh wasabi, Sakana which are all ok to mediocre.  But i saw this place driving on bell and 63rd ave and saw that it had a grand opening sign so I thought I would check it out.  Sushi catcher was genuinely great sushi with amazing staff and service!  Fish was fresh and the rolls were unique and delicious! Highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great food and a good time!  Not to mention the wonderful owners I met Su and Kc!"}
{"text":"Great spot for anything you are looking for. Great options and the food is spot on. Cozy environment and the staff are friendly at the sushi bar. :)"}
{"text":"Affordable, check. Friendly customer service oriented, check. Great sushi that tastes authentic, check. This is by far one of the best little secrets I found."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, whenever I come here I really enjoy the taste of how fresh the fish is (veteran sushi eater), and all the staff is incredibly friendly each and everytime. The rolls come out quick and are delicious! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Maybe I have a higher expectation for sushi. The rolls weren't bad but weren't close to the best. They were also a little too loose. The service was good. The calamari was calamari sticks and weren't anything to speak of. It's not a bad place but I wouldn't make it my sushi spot."}
{"text":"We have being going to sushi catcher for quite some  time now. Everything is always great. Staff is always fanominal!! Sushi catcher set the standard High. And its mine and my girlfriends stopping place to get fresh sushi and relax in an amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sushi Catcher is a hidden gem and I'm glad I found it. Their sushi is amazing!!!! There are so many options to choose from. We come in with our 4 year old daughter and special order - Fei is always happy to help us out anytime we come in."}
{"text":"Small place with great menu, reasonable prices and fresh fish. There are a lot if options in the area and this place is now one of my favs to visit."}
{"text":"Holy hole in the wall Batman! I'm always a little weary of strip mall sushi stops but this place was great.  Service quality and speed is good.  Well over 25 people inside when I happened by to eat but their chef was cranking out food nonstop and had a good flow to getting everyone fed."}
{"text":"I just moved back to AZ after 5 years. I must say this is the best sushi I have had in a long time. I lived in San Diego prior to coming back here and this is better than any sushi I ever had there. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal it was our first time here they gave us a sample of the halibut and topped off an amazing meal with a complimentary serving of Mochica. I could definitely become a regular here"}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls and excellent service. The buddha heartburn roll is a tasty little treat if you are looking for some heat. Complementary salad and dessert, both delectable. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I's favorite place to eat sushi, we go at least twice a month we've never had a bad experience. Trained chefs, very nice staff, always clean and very reasonable prices!!!"}
{"text":"Got seated here at 5:55 pm, one server for the whole place.   Server came by and asked for drink orders, i said I'll have your Happy Hour special, plum wine.  Server says, at 6:01pm, no more Specials.  I'm like , are you serious?  You'd rather split hairs about when i sat down vs. when you served me, and tick off a loyal customer rather than give a dollar off a glass of wine ?  Suit yourself.    Then our Bento Boxes came, and they're just not the same fresh quality they used to be.  No cucumbers, etc.    They seem to be cutting staff and quality.   Other options nearby."}
{"text":"It was a Wednesday night and my girlfriend and I narrowed our restaurant choices down to Arrowhead Grill or Sushi Catcher.  We decided Sushi Catcher since we both LOVE sushi.  I had very high expectations after reading a lot of good reviews on Yelp.   We sat at the sushi bar and we had a wonderful time joking around with both the sushi chef and the hostess which were also the owners.  The sushi rolls were excellent and the service was superb.  My girlfriend and I have now found our favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, had the Super Las Vegas roll & Japanese Lasagna roll. the Japanese Lasagna roll melts in your mouth while the Super LV roll has a slight fried crisp the gives a luscious crunch. So Yum! Accompanied with a  Saki er and hot green tea. Won the 1st timer approval! We'll be back for 2nds."}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe I haven't been here yet. Loved every roll, but the standout was the Arizona roll - smokey sauce was addicting. Will have to try the Tonkotsu Ramen next time. Looks like happy hour is 3-6pm."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi is the baked scallop california roll -- it is always fresh and flavorful. HOWEVER, I decided one day to try other things on their menu other than sushi. I decided to get their pork tonkotsu ramen bowl. For $9, it was the tiniest bowl I had ever seen and **literally** it came with two, minuscule, PAPER-THIN slices of pork. Seriously!? What a rip off. I expressed my disappointment to the waitress, and they did nothing. This place might be worth it for happy hour, but their ramen is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Sushi was great, fresh and tastey.  Ordered a few things, but the best was the regular tuna rolls (ordered inside out with rice on outside) and they were perfect and huge.  Also tempora shrimp rolls great, and the tempura vegetables especially sweet potato were yummy.  Friendly server and sushi chef.  Price about 20% less than others in the area that are comparable.  Will go there again. Spent $78 for 4 people including tip and 3 large beers 1 soda."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious.  You must order a jalapeño bomb. So good! I love that the sushi chefs were all Asian, so you really got the feeling of authenticity.  The only reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars is because the two young waitresses were awkward and appeared stupid; almost like they had no clue what they were talking about. For example,  instead of filling our water at the table, they would take our glasses and go to the kitchen and fill them there.  It's improper. Or, if you asked them for a check, they would say, \"you want the check now?\" Um....yeah that's why I asked for it lol. Anyway you get the idea. The food is great though!"}
{"text":"Try the Catcher Roll!  It's loaded with sashimi grade bite sized ahi, salmon, shrimp and yellowtail atop a tuna roll and drizzled with Sriracha and chili.  It's new on the menu.  Delicious!  Spicy, but you won't cry because the flavors are spectacular, so is texture!  He will make it mild for you soft tongues.  ;')"}
{"text":"This is a cute restaurant and the staff was very nice.  They didn't rush you or make you feel uncomfortable.  The Sushi: the salmon sushi was very tasty and I could tell that they prepare it themselves and do not buy it prepackaged.  The chef was very nice and we enjoyed talking to him and he answered all our questions.  I can't wait to try the yellowtail collar.  I saw it on the special menu after I already ate most of my food.  I know good sushi and I know how to prepare it also.  Sushi Catcher does an excellent job of preparing the food.  They know what parts of the fish to use for certain orders such as nigiri, rolls, shashimi, etc.   Prices weren't bad either for the sushi.  Sake bombs were $5 for a large Kirin and small carafe of hot sake.   Definitely our new favorite sushi place.  Almost forgot, new owners as of about 6 weeks ago."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar alone and ordered a sashimi combo. I'm not an expert on sushi, but I definitely enjoyed it. I'm giving this 5 stars because of the owners. I talked to them my entire meal and had a great time. They are very nice people who try to have fun and care about their customers.  If they're not too busy, they love talking to their customers. So strike up a conversation with them and you'll have a good experience. Maybe you'll get a dish on the house along the way ;).  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is probably my family's favourite restaurant when we're craving something healthy -- we go here several times a month and are always pleased.  The wait staff is friendly and the food is delicious and so well priced!  I pretty much always get at least one order of the salmon sashimi, which is my absolute favourite, and theirs is excellent!  The fish is very creamy and soft and cut perfectly.  My son can't get enough of the gyoza, and both kids are in love with the mochi ice cream for dessert.  Can't recommend Sushi Catcher highly enough."}
{"text":"Not very friendly / or good service. Food was fair. We ordered sea urchin but they brought us yellowtail instead. When asked which item was the sea urchin, they then informed us they were out of it. Wouldn't any good restaurant have informed us they were out of it instead of making an immediate substitution?"}
{"text":"Finally, a Great locally owned Sushi restaurant!! I've been coming here since they opened; never once disappointed. Portion sizes are good, prices are good, customer service is good and quality is good!  It is a casual little place, and I'm very glad to see they are doing so well; it is much deserved!"}
{"text":"I'm confused by the rating. I went out of my way to come here for HH based on Yelp reviews, and it turned out to just be ok. We ordered 4 rolls, the Screaming-O, and chicken teriyaki...A LOT for 2 people and none of the rolls really stood out. The Screaming-O looks better than it actually tastes. I actually had 2 bites and left the rest. For $14, it was a waste of money...  Overall, just okay. It wouldn't be my first choice for sushi."}
{"text":"been here 4 times, and i am about to go again. very good sushi quality and price is not that bad. ya the place is small and there is not much decor but who cares. i am there to eat not chill and hang out."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't help but upgrade this place to 5 stars.  No, this isnt a 5 star location, but by god the service is worth 7 stars alone.  The food is fresh and fantastic every time we go there.  To top it off, the adorable waitress(es) there are very friendly.  They brought us a cucumber and crab salad as a little appetizer free of charge, and after we were done with our fairly large meal, she brought out a couple different types of mochi surrounding a big scoop of vanilla ice cream also free of charge....who does that?!?  It's the above and beyond mentality that keeps us coming back to this cozy little spot, and we will keep coming back as long as the food and service stays this magnificent. They have no problems catering to our every need (which includes huge helpings of ginger and various sauces that we always get).  The waitress recognizes us every time we come in, and it feels very welcoming and homey to show up and be greeted with such enthusiasm that they have there.  See you next time sushi catcher!"}
{"text":"Best sushi that I have found in the West Valley!!! Tonight we had a group of eight so we tried many different sushi's and everyone of them were absolutely delicious!!!  Service was excellent. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great; sushi, ramen, and jalapeño poppers! It didn't matter. It was all so tasty! Haven't been to their happy hour but that looks dank also."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I used to go to the old sushi place that was here, and was sad to see it close. However, I am SO glad Sushi Catcher is here now!!  I have gone to Sushi Catcher 3 times now (1 dine in and 2 pickup) The first time we went, we dined in and had a really great time talking to the owner, KC. The rolls were fantastic, and the presentation was beautiful. KC is really great at what he does, and you can tell he enjoys it. The second time we picked up the food, my husband went in, and KC recognized him immediately. The same thing happened to me the 3rd I went in to pick up the food. It is nice to go to a place where you feel like a person, and not just another number.  In terms of price, Sushi Catcher is fantastic. Today when I went in, the total was about $33.00 for 6 rolls. We choose 5 items off the happy hour, and one off the regular menu. Even though the happy hour rolls are discounted all day, I didn't feel like I was missing out when it came to the quality. Also, the presentation is even great when you order the food to go.   I would recommend Sushi Catcher to anyone who is looking for a nice spot in West Valley. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Not many places have seaweed salad. Went there specially for it and I was very satisfied. My daughter doesn't eat much sushi but we ordered several rolls and ate happily. Customer for life."}
{"text":"It is cozy and good place to have a dinner with family. The servers are friendly and nice. They also have happy hour all day so you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi place! The yellowtail kama is to die for. Prices are reasonable and the staff is couteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Really good. My husband and I both got the bento box. We are stuffed! We got soup salad rice meat and the tootsie rolls were to die for!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in the Valley. Prices are great. Dont be put off by the location, it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and it was quite busy. My boyfriend and I were greeted warmly as usual. This time I decided to get the Hae Do Bap (pardon my spelling) which is sashimi over a salad and rice with a spicy korean sauce and my boyfriend order the Casey Roll and the Rainbow roll instead of our regular chirashi. As usual, we were not disappointed! While we waited for our meal to arrive Sue talked to us a little just to catch up since we haven't been back for a while and after our meal KC did the same, which is nice because you know they  truly remember and care for their customers.  What always amazes me is although KC is the only sushi chef there, yet the food always comes out in a timely manner. Even when it gets busy the food and service quality is never compromised.  I still vouch for the place. It is a small business and worth trying and retrying!"}
{"text":"Happy to have this place nearby. One of the very few good sushi place on this side of town.   PROS: 1. Fresh fish 2. Nice selection of sushi, sashimi and rolls.   CONS: 1. Decor is not the nicest 2. Servers seem blah about being there"}
{"text":"I heard the raving reviews about this place. So I decided to try it. The service was terrible. There were two couples that came into the restaurant after us thay received their food before us. I know it does not take a long time to make sushi or the edamames.   The sushi was delicious but that doesn't entirely make up for the horrible service. Also, the restaurant is too tiny not to have a conversation that couldn't be overheard by another table. I definitely won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of our go-to sushi restaurants in the North Glendale area. Their sushi is great and always fresh! I highly recommend their superman burrito roll or their poke tuna salad. As for service, they are extremely friendly although  slightly slow at times. If you're in the area, definitely worth dropping by."}
{"text":"This place is my hidden sushi gem. Coming from NYC area I found it very difficult finding great sushi here in the desert...shocker I know.  The fellow yelpers have given me a good tip about this place and surely happy I listened! This little mom and pop sushi spot is more Korean sushi than Japanese. How do they differ? Well Korean sushi offers a bit more different things such as the hoedenbap (sp?). Picture this: sashimi sliced even smaller over greens with threads of radish and fish roe and spicy Korean red sauce poured all over it. Hungry yet? And can't beat the prices either. Cute and sweet couple that owns this little (and I mean LITTLE) place. Don't forget to ask for the fresh wasabi. You won't regret that."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had in Phoenix. Seriously great food and service. I recommend everyone come here. Everyone I have brought here has fallen in love with it. My husband absolutely loves this place as well. Our friends introduced it to us and it's been our go to sushi place since."}
{"text":"Wow, I have been to a million sushi places in my life and this one really surprised me! Don't judge a book by its cover for sure. Looks like a simple place in a strip center but man they do they make some awesome sushi rolls. Prices are some of the most fair I have seen too. We will be going back many times, new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sushi restaurant in the northwest valley, and I'm a snob about sushi.  This seemingly hole-in-wall, strip mall location is perfect for the all-day happy hour sushi!  Chef, Po will create masterful sushi pleasant to the eye and taste. I'm done spending an arm and a leg for sushi, now that Sushi Catcher is my local/home favorite!"}
{"text":"THE FOOD WAS GREAT!  The service was horrible! Trey was our server. He checked in once & my husband was out of ice tea the entire time. It took over 45 minutes to get our first roll. Also asked Trey for more wasabi and he totally forgot..along with ice tea.  The sushi was very good! Prices were great too.  We will go back, however we will sit at the small bar to be sure we are not forgotten & get better service!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Catcher 4-5 times in the past few months. Have had a rainbow roll, casey roll, and spicy salmon roll. All were very fresh, tasty, and melt in your mouth delicious. The prices are very reasonable, and staff are always friendly and gracious. I have sushi 1-2X/week, and this has become my place to go in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious sushi, however their decor is lacking. The place looked a little sketchy to say the least, but the friendly staff made up for that! We tried the jalepeno bombs, vegas roll, and the volcano roll.. All very tastey."}
{"text":"Coming from SF Bay Area and looking for a great Sushi place.  I found Sushi Catcher from my cuz.  Best Sushi , clean restaurant, friendly staffs and owner is very friendly. A \"Must Visit\" Sushi place.  Must try their Ramen , Star Wars and Jalapeno Bomb"}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise, today. Found this place on yelp. We are from Houston, Tx, and have not had sushi since we left in December. Glad we stopped in.  Small family run restaurant. Our server was Alex. He was outstanding. Good recommendations numerous restaurants in the area. Very efficient. Very personable.  We started with edamame and miso soup. Both good. Next we're tamago, octopus, eel, mackerel and maguro nigiri. Very good quality and flavor. Next was fried soft shelled crab. Everything was excellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi pro, but an occasional indulger.  Stopped here last night on a whim, and it did not disappoint.   We arrived around 5:30, and were all alone.  Small establishment, seats about 30.  Ordered a spicy tuna roll, lava roll, shrimp roll and the fried California roll...they threw in a tootsie roll which was surprising.   I know rolls arent't  real \"sushi\", but it was still yummy.  They started the meal with a crab and cucumber salad which was delicious.  We will definitely be back, and the prices were awesome.  All this for only $20."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. The hot tea was very good. We ordered the Dragon Roll, my daughter LOVED it. She ate it so fast I did not even get a taste. I order the raw fish, it was also very good. The service was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I think they've figured out their issues. This place is back. Great lunch experience. Quick service, tasty rolls and fresh tasting fish. Oh, and fresh wasabi! Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"FIRST TIMER HERE!  I recently discovered sushi from buying some at Fry's and decided to try an actual sushi place. This is the closest location in my area that seemed to have good reviews, and now I know why. This place is the REAL DEAL.  First off, the service was really well. We had a server who seemed to be the only server working at the time, (ON A SATURDAY NIGHT? I really hope that isn't the case!). As much of a load she had, she was very sweet and attentive.   For an appetizer, I was suggested by our server, I had the Gold Avocado. That was a first, but not a last order. It is a deep fried avocado, with crab! Seriously, so good.  As for my entrée, I had the Cajun Spicy Chicken! It all tastes the same for me, except this one was outstanding!   The little problem I did have though, was that it was a bit uncomfortably hot inside. That is one peeve of mine. I can't be comfortable while sweating. The service and food is what kept this review good!!   Sushi Catcher has another regular customer! Thank you to the cooks, And for our server who was working tables alone, (which is a little disappointing on managements part, sorry I don't remember her name) thank you! I hope to have you and your adorable accent again!!   :)"}
{"text":"It was so uncomfortably hot, especially to eat sushi in. You have to keep it at least 80 degrees for a restaurant. Service was great. It was so hot I couldn't even finish my beer."}
{"text":"Sushi catcher is an above average sushi place the fish and ingredients could be a little fresher but that doesn't hinder the experience you'll have. It's a pretty small seating place but the staff is very friendly and attentive. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Sushi Catcher is very far from us, but I won't mind driving out here for their good dishes. The portions are generous. The quality of food is excellent. The price is very reasonable compare to other sushi restaurants. The service is unbeatable. I would come back here again soon. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who look for good service and quality foods for the best bang on their bucks. Recommend that you call ahead of time for reservations so you do not have to wait."}
{"text":"Since the Ted takeover I have not been in until last night. I have been going to this sushi place since before KC owned it. I have to say the food is about the same as when KC was behind the bar and they kept the $5 Sake Bombers. Some portions are smaller but hardly noticeable unless you knew what they looked like before and are looking for something negative to put down the new owners.  Ted is nice and so is the other chef. Not as personable as KC and Sue but they are trying to fix that. I saw the second chef come out from behind the bar and greet several patrons and make sure everything was good. Ted, he is hard to understand at times with his accent and low tones and is at no fault for this.  Wait staff is different and doesn't know how to answer basic food questions. I asked them if there was any special fish in today. I got a look like What? and both proceeded to look at an obnoxious rainbow colored sign with todays specials and just recite what I could clearly read. Still didn't answer my question. This sign was just the roll of the day and one other thing. I wanted to know if they had any other kinds of fish in that wasn't on the everyday menu.  Things I would change if this were my place would be: More training for the wait staff and Get a different selection of fish in occasionally ~ Big Eye, Blue Fin, Halibut, Wild Salmon, Exotic Invertebrate, ect.  All in all still a good place to eat at good prices."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot hands down. Great bentobox deals and the gyoza and sashimi best I've ever had! Happy Hour every day!!! $3 sushi rolls and $5 sake bombs!  Although haply he is awesome I come for the outstanding food and service! Go to place if you're near arrowhead but definitely worth the drive if you're not close."}
{"text":"This place changed my mind about baked rolls. I never used to order them, but after accidentally eating their baked lobster roll thanks to an ordering mix up I've been a fan! The rest of the menu had decent rolls but nothing extraordinarily memorable. I just go for the baked lobster roll. The staff are friendly and accommodating but the place fills up fast so get there before the rush!"}
{"text":"I love this place! First time there, VERY friendly service, great food, awesome prices"}
{"text":"Somewhat of a hole in the wall restaurant, but usually the hole in the wall places pack the most flavor and quality. The wifey and I were adventurous and ordered the Chefs Special for sushi (9 sashimi, 5 PC sushi, and 2 special rolls).  It is very small inside but it reminded me that it's not always the decor that makes the place, but definitely the food. We also have numerous hole in the wall places in SoCal that are the friggin' bomb! So we were def pumped for the sushi.  So the sushi itself...fresh fish = great sushi. Presentation on a wooden boat = even better! With the sashimi and special rolls, everything was flavorful and you can tell the sushi chef spent time on the rolls. The service was ok only being the fact that the waitress was in charge of every table in the restaurant.  The wifey and I will be back because happy hour is ALL THE TIME, as many have stated here. I just wish you were closer to my area. Great job, we will see you again!"}
{"text":"So I had driven by this place hundreds of times and never realized it was there. It is in a shopping center.  Do not let that scare you. The inside is very clean and quaint. It was packed on a Friday night and I can see why. They have very creative rolls that I had never seen anywhere else. Baked garlic rolls? (Rice stuffed with crab and avocado) a garlic sauce on top and then baked. I could have eaten 2 orders of them as my meal and been a very happy camper. There is a new roll the Golden avocado roll. (I have an obsession with avocados). They literally cut two avocados into halves stuff them with a crab mix and lightly fry them. They were out of this world. The service was good and the sushi came out fast . I think they know the place is small and want to get customers in and out quickly. I can't wait to go back and try some different rolls now that I know it's there or I might just order my 2 orders of the baked garlic rolls as my meal who knows."}
{"text":"So unfortunately I would have liked to give these guys a higher score but I just can't. I was excited for this place but I guess it wasn't meant to be! We arrived at 2:15-2:20pm on a Thursday afternoon and two other pairs of folks entered too. That's 7 people total. We were greeted and drinks brought, he took the order at around 2:30 and that's when it went downhill. We didn't get our food until about 3:20, we literally waited almost an hour for the food and all we ordered was fried tofu, gyoza (which we were never asked if we wanted steamed or pan fried) and chicken and rice. There was no reason it should have taken that long, I think at one point even the server was confused at how long it was taking.  There wasn't anything amazing about the food and one of my friends literally just ordered plain steamed rice with chicken teriyaki and hers was the last to come out. The other friend ordered gyoza which now 2 hours later are starting to make his stomach hurt, probably because we wanted steamed and not fried. Oh well it is what it is!"}
{"text":"A little diamond in the rough. I would never have come in here if it werent for its yelp reviews. The place was located in a strip mall and its sign only said sushi until you got to the front door did you see \"sushi catcher\"  The decor is average for your standard hole in the wall. But food was great. There was a complimentary crab and cucumber salad. I ordered the chirashi bowl for lunch which was a huge portion. The fish was surprisingly fresh. The rice was seasoned as well.   I've been trying out lots of sushi places in the glendale area and I have not wanted to go back to any sushi restaurant but i will definitely return to this one!"}
{"text":"Service should really get a 5. The girl there is so attentive and kind.  She doesn't seem to hate her job and that's always a breath of fresh air. The sushi is pretty good and the place isn't awful. It's my second choice for sushi."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have had in Phoenix! Sashimi was amazingly fresh. Sushi roll rice was sooo good. Perfect proportions. Good prices"}
{"text":"My family tried Sushi Catcher for the first time, tonight. So happy we did!  Delicious sushi, great prices. We're happy we used Yelp to find this place!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were in the Glendale area and stopped pretty quickly to eat. This place is a small hole in the wall type place but we thoroughly enjoyed the food. It was very good!!  Service was prompt!!  We had the salmon crunch roll, the shrimp tempura roll, miso soup and (awesome) garlic edamame!!!  Everything was delicious!!!  The place was pretty packed the whole time we were there 7:30 pm on a Sunday night. We highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing we showed up right when it opened and were greeted with the best service. The food was excellent. It started with a cucumber salad and then the sushi that came out was the best I've had in awhile. The Mochi in the end was the cherry on the top. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We love going here for sushi. Prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious.  Only downside is thay we had to wait quite long for a table bc it is a small restaurant with maybe 10 tables. The server even told us that they did not have any tables available and basically to leave. This was me, my 60 yr old mother, and two young children. We have not been back since :("}
{"text":"Some great things like the Tootsie Roll and the Palate Cleansing Salad (complementary) and the Bento options. Some of the other items were a complete miss. I don't think I'll return but the place is clean and the peeps are nice.  Good selecting!"}
{"text":"I really like this place it keeps getting better and better. The story is that the chef here was rewarded best sushi chef in Japan.. The real deal and his dream was to open the best in USA and do the American Dream. I am very fortunate to have the food here before they get too busy."}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen soup probably the best in the valley. Fantastic sushi with fresh ingredients artfully executed.  Golden avocado was amazing."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, good sized portions and cozy atmosphere, this little restaurant has a happy family feel!"}
{"text":"Killer sushi place. Small and tucked away in a shopping strip mall. Happy hour is killer and the food quality is excellent excellent.   The entire team seems to enjoy their work and are on the ball. One of my favorite places on the west side."}
{"text":"Small but wonderful. Don't let the strip mall steer ambiance you away.  Great service, family run, fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and snagged the last empty table; be aware it is very small and there aren't many tables. The service wasn't that great, but I didn't expect it to be.   Don't let the outside deter you as the sushi is pretty good and not too expensive... A little more expensive than I would have expected, but what can you do... If I was just to rate the food, it would be a 5 star review.   The menu isn't as explanative as it should be with the rolls - I can't remember exactly what was and wasn't on there, but I do know that I had to ask about a couple of the rolls and the explanation the server gave wasn't 100% clear so know that it may be a bit of a surprise; luckily for me, I'm not at all picky with my sushi.   PS- definitely try the iced green tea!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Went with my damsel in distress she needed a sushi fix. Quite quaint you wont see a flashy sushi sign, the menu is solid nothing too fancy to scare you away; just a small dive feel with a few tables and decent service :)"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I highly recommend the spicy miso ramen! The waitress was awesome and the staff was super friendly"}
{"text":"Had Poke bowl, caterpillar roll, volcano roll, chirac hi bowl and all were good. Do not recommend Ted roll, did not like spicy tuna or sauce on the roll. The place was small and hot but service was good and prices were good. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! We were there for 5 minutes before they asked if we were wanted something to drink. They were walking past us and did not bother giving us menus. After being ignored for 30 minutes we just got up and left."}
{"text":"Our first time there today and everything was good, liked the all day happy hour menu as well as the regular menu including bento box. The server was friendly and we got our food fast. Will go back there again!"}
{"text":"Sushi Catcher is quite delicious. They have really unique sushi rolls and their prices are affordable. Even if their sushi wasn't yummy, I would still have to go back because the sushi chef and waiter are so sweet and are really proud of their new restaurant. But, that isn't the case. I'll be going back not only because of the great service, but because they know how to make some good sushi."}
{"text":"Okay so screw all the negative 1 star, 2 star reviews!! I've eaten at tons of sushi places! Sushi catcher is by far the best sushi I've had in Phoenix!!! I love how it's a little hole in the wall place! The staff is excellent! Always remember My family and I!! Their pricing is by far the cheapest in Phoenix!!! Large beer and saki for 5 bucks you can't beat that all day every day!!! I recommend anyone looking for a good sushi spot that this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"My search for great sushi continued until today. What a great little restaurant. I'll stick to this place for now on. There was only one server on duty but she killed it and the chefs were spot on. There's only like 10 tables so you may wait a min but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Service was courteous, but slow. Food was really impressive.     I thought the quality was really great for the price. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"From the outside, it doesn't look like much.  But on the inside, there is great sushi, fantastic prices and extremely friendly staff.  The woman who greeted us (the owner perhaps?) asked if we'd been there before.  When we told her we hadn't, she gave us the royal treatment.  She sent out seaweed salad (delicious), fresh wasabi with the sushi and mochi ice cream at the end.  She also brought out our sushi and sashimi in a giant wooden boat.  Really fun experience.     They have happy hour all day.  Rolls are fresh, tasty and interesting!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Just wonderful all around.  The three item bento box is the way to go. The miso soup is perfect, spicy tuna roll has great rice and great flavor, pan fried mackerel was perfectly cooked, gyoza nice and crispy with great ponzu sauce, flaky tempura.....I could just go on and on.  Seems like a steal at $12 for the 3 item bento box. Two people could even split it for lunch I bet.  The dinner service was great and attentive, and they are open late.  Don't be afraid of its location in an older strip mall...just think of it as a diamond in the rough.  Loved it and will be back for sure.  They need to go give Squid Ink a class on how it's done."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and it is outstanding especially when you factor in the cost. Everything I have had has been amazing and the sushi is fresh and you get a good amount of fish. I feel like so many places are getting out of control with rice but they have it dialed in. Great food and service! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a date here, and it was SO DELICIOUS.  The place is small, but it's packed because it's just so good. I got the Bento box with beef terriyaki, and it was divine! I don't think I've better than that.  Highly recommend this place to anyone. I'll definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"It's your pretty standard Americanized sushi restaurant.   Value: They have happy hour all day and they are good prices for big portions.   Ambiance: To be completely honest, the ambiance is pretty lacking. It's a small, cramped restaurant and not a place I would recommend for a group or party.  Overall: An OK restaurant to get some decent sushi, but not somewhere I would bring a large group."}
{"text":"Fresh food! Great service! Lively atmosphere!  Would def recommend :) My husband and I come here on most o our date nights before we go anywhere else. We bring our kids here too. It is kid friendly. This place got our kids loving sushi. I recommend it to all my friends. PS. Dessert is yummy too!"}
{"text":"Wow I checked the reviews on this place and was very happy I did. This the best I have eaten. The rainbow roll is awesome! Give it a try you will love it."}
{"text":"I'm bummed to give a 3 out of 5 only because I would have initially given it a huge, happy, yummy 5, except my last visit was a bummer. I've gone to Sushi Catcher several times, mostly togo orders but once ate inside by myself because I just LOVE their Volcano Roll!! I live over 30 minutes away and make the journey there just to get it and pass several other sushi spots but my last experience was a super bummer! I'm a college student so when I do decide that I can fit sushi into my budget, I pray that its a great experience. I called my order in like usual, picked it up and was on my way. For some reason I felt like checking the food before driving off and I'm glad I did but also mad at myself for not speaking up as much as I wish I had. When I looked at the Volcano Roll it was entirely cold, it should be somewhat warm, at least the ingredients on top. It was missing the masago and green onions as well. Call me dramatic but most places charge you extra for masago, i LOVVE masago AND green onions and if you've had this roll you can understand that it definitely adds to its greatness! Aside from that, the masago and green onions are ingredients on the roll and should've come with it anyway. I went back inside, feeling like such a rude customer and explaining so nicely that these two components were missed. The girl looked at me stupidly and hands it off to the chef to fix, he looks at it stupidly as well but goes on to \"fix\" it. I thanked them up and down and was on my way, again. Got in the car and look at the roll and the chef literally the threw the ingredients on the roll with no care. Again being a sushi snob, sushi is an art and yes, I budget my money so when I'm paying X amount of money for sushi I want it right lol. I couldn't \"be that person\" and go back in, I more than anything wanted to go back and ask them to kindly make me a new roll but I just didn't have the guts to do it. I went home bummed out, tossed my roll in the oven for a quick broil, and what do you know, I have masago and green onions in my fridge so I made the roll as best as it was supposed to initially be lol. The roll tasted terrible, I haven't gone back since and I really want to but after feeling like the chef didn't care that day, who knows maybe he was having a shitty day, but that could cost you a customer. I REALLY would like to return and receive my Volcano Roll how I should've received initially it but I'm not willing to pay for less than. Thanks for the delicious Volcano Rolls prior to this experience.."}
{"text":"Delicious! Recommend the nigiri (yellowtail, salmon and squid); Sex on the Beach roll; salmon roll and uni.  All were fantastic!  Happy that we found this gem through Yelp!  We did not order the poke salads, but they looked amazing!   Note: the place has very limited seating and service is not super rapid, but the food is worth any inconvenience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here!!! Who doesn't love sushi that doesn't empty out all of your pockets lol. The price is great and the quality is even better."}
{"text":"Ehhh. I was excited to try this place but the food here is just average. I see that the reviews for them on here are over 2-3 years ago some about a yea but something must have changed because the food was not like how others described. First off, service was great, average, and the server was nice. But the kitchen took forever to make our food! My wife and I were to only table in the entire restaurant. I can't imagine how long they take if the restaurant had more tables. Second, some sushi dish was great and some were not. I got spicy tuna and it was not spicy but sour!! The tuna was so sour I had to drenched it in soy sauce to balance the flavors...   Lastly, we order their spicy miso ramen and if I had to rate it, it would be 7.5/10.. The broth was good but no vegetables like bean sprouts, corn, or seaweed were available to put in the soup... except they put a few black mushroom strings and just toss it in there.   I was disappointed but I'll definitely give other dishes a try later on but not for awhile."}
{"text":"Great place! Well priced and good portions. Food delivery a bit slow.  We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Another new owner?  Limited menu selection  Mediocre food Friendly service  Too bad there is not a lot of option for sushi in Phoenix. If this was CA, I would give less than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Our new favorite local sushi, great quality dish and a great chef in a very casual setting, and their own unique wasabi sauce that is just delicious. The rolls are usually not my thing but I took a chance and was really pleased, superstar roll was off the hook! Highly recommended, you'd never stop in there if you didn't know what it was, very small strip plaza, but if your reading reviews on Yelp and your nearby, go here!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi in the north valley.  It is so much better than Squid Ink (yuck).  It is small but the food is great.  Had various sushi and rolls which were all good.  My wife had chicken udon which she liked very much.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I sit at the bar so I can talk to the chef. He is awesome, will make you anything the way you want. I prefer spicy and he always adds spicy crab for me!! Hands down best!!  Po rocks!!!  Dancing spider is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"If you looking to get good, although not amazing, sushi for CHEAP, you've found the place. Let  me break this down for you, $6 all day happy hour casey roll; a shrimp tempura roll topped with spicy tuna. SIX DOLLARS. And its delicious. Rainbow roll for 7.50? get outta here! AND its pretty damn good. I am trying to eat here as much as possibly before they realize that I'd be willing to pay more. Please don't.  The lunch specials are also pretty great. I highly recommend the the grilled mackerel to which you can add a shrimp tempura roll if you'd like.   The place is a tad bit crammed. Who cares? Get it to go, the food is great."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi spot! Staff was friendly, sushi was amazing and fresh. I loved the fresh wasabi. All day, everyday happy hour is the best, can't beat the prices! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!! Never disappointed! We Got the boat this time. Super good and filling for the two of us! Giant pieces of sashimi!!! Seriously! Bigger than most places! Good service! Good people! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband was looking for a new (to us) sushi place that had a happy hour, since we wanted to enjoy the best of both worlds... Sushi & moderate cost.  It is located on the North side of Bell Rd, right next to a a Nails salon, we almost missed it too. It is a small place, and when we got there, there were only 3 other patrons there, that didn't not discouraged us from trying it out, and I am glad we did. They have a list of sushi rolls that are on the Happy hour menu, which means that they were anywhere from $4-$5 dollars each. We ordered from the happy hour menu, and the regular menu. My husband got the Sashimi-A, which was an assortment of very fresh, and artistically cut pieces of fish (Salmon, Tuna, etc), the Superman Burrito Roll, was fun, and really yummy; Tootsie roll, Vegas roll, and the Tempura Shrimp Roll. As we were finishing our meal, the sushi chef served us some really cool and delicious oranges artistically cut in segments, with some sort of dressing, and a Mochi (Japanese ice cream), compliments of the house. They had one server on that they, that was friendly, an very attentive, he also was able to give me information on the Plum Wine I had with my dinner.  This is not a very fancy place, but it's got delicious food, friendly Staff, and great prices!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite stop for sushi hands down. Most folks who eat sushi do not really understand how a sushi restaurant works; I eat sushi at least two to three times a week and so there is kind of a culture you want to embrace when going to a sushi restaurant: 1. Don't be in a hurry. Although it may be open for lunch, and less you get a special, or something specifically for lunch, it's going to take a little bit of time. Sushi is made to order and if there's several customers it is going to take a bit. Have a drink relax don't rush. 2. Ordering from the Sushi menu is okay, but if you really want a traditional sushi experience the only way to go is Omakase, which means \"Chef's Choice\". Basically you said at the bar, let the chef know you want to do Omakase, and then proceed to let him know what kind of fish you like or what kind of rolled you enjoy. Then basically he'll make you things that he feels you would like that may not even be on the menu and that is awesome. 3. Make sure to tip both the waitress for her ability to keep your drink's refreshed, and tip the chef. Although I have not tried it, tradition is usually you buy him a drink and leave a small tip afterward.  4. Finally understand that heating Sushi is not an American culture, and try to be respectful of how they serve you the meal. Sushi really is an art, and should be enjoyed that way.  Here at Sushi catcher, the chef is very friendly as well as the waitress. They do the best they can to interact and be friendly, and yes the service is not super quick but that's okay, I enjoy my sake bomber, chat with a chef while he's making my rolls, and overall I'm able to relax and enjoy an incredible Sushi experience. There are a lot of new sushi restaurants opening that do not understand what Omakase is, and some that even won't even do it when asked,  so take advantage of the ones we have here in the valley that do, and strive to make it about more than just feeding your belly."}
{"text":"I go all around town for sushi and try different places. This place by far is the best sushi in town! It's a small place but very cozy. My boyfriend and I ordered 6 rolls (wayyyy too many) but I'm glad we had a chance to try them, they came out in a wooden boat which was very neat. The waitress was the sweetest, the place is very clean, sushi is beyond fresh, and a lot of variety. This will be the only place I go for sushi now. I am beyond impressed with this place, not one bad thing to say!"}
{"text":"We felt like having sushi and searched up some places close by on Yelp. Sushi Catcher has great reviews, so we decided to try it out. Casey is the owner and he makes all the sushi himself. It's amazing, he makes the best sushi.   Needless to say, it was absolutely delicious, and he was so gracious, he even sent us home with some saki. So glad we have a place to get some fantastic sushi again, won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"So good! I was in town visiting family and wanted sushi, so glad we found this place. Fresh wasabi, wonderful rolls. Our favorites were the Casey roll and Buddah's Heartburn.  Also great to support small business."}
{"text":"Great place.  We love it here! You will too! Small hole in the wall.  But very reputable place."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I haven't eaten here in a few years but was in the area and stopped by.   The sushi is just as good as I remember.   The tuna poke was tasty.  The Spider-Man roll was unique and fresh.   My favorite is the superman roll.   It doesn't have rice which is nice if you're watching your carbs.   Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday at 6p. Very small dining area and a large party was seated when we arrived. We were promptly greeted and our orders taken. Ordered the calamari appetizer....crunchy and not soggy, a little too much breading for my taste.  Salmon roll from the happy hour menu $3 great value. Rainbow roll was large and tasty. Dragon roll was great, but the highlight of the dinner was the sushi burrito. HUGE! DELICIOUS! Excellent value.  The service and wait time were decent considering the large party ahead of us ordered at least one of everything from the menu.  The only negative thing I can comment on was the noise level of the rather rambunctious adults in that large party."}
{"text":"What a catch! A Whole-In-The-Wall Sushi place with great prices and good sushi! My brother and I decided to give this place a go last night. We were delighted with everything! We got there in time for Happy Hour (every day from 3pm-6pm.) They had a KILLER selection on the Happy Hour menu. Nothing over 6 bucks and about 20 or more item's to choose from. Everything from Sushi, Salads, Appetizers, and Entree's. And of course Saki Bombs, Wine, and Beers. After 3 different Rolls, (Vegas, Salmon, and Cali,) and a calamari salad we were stuffed. And before your dinner you get a little house salad (Pickled cucumbers, with a crab salad on top.) I could have eaten an entire bowl of it. My brother got a soda and I got a glass of white wine ($4 on happy hour.) and I believe our bill was $23.00. Our server was so sweet, and we sat up at the sushi bar and talked to the chef who asked us a bunch of questions and kept us in conversation. We were please all the way around. The only reason I can't give it one more star is it was a very simple, not very exciting, interior, or exterior. I like a fun decor. That's just me. But we will definitely be return customers."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago because my friend recommended it. When I went in, there was only one other person seated. I was greeted by the server who was busy on her laptop and/or cellphone while we were there. I ordered three rolls...and to be honest not only were they mediocre..but also I waited for about 20 minutes. This was definitely a red flag considering the sushi chef was having a great time talking to the other customer at the bar. I rarely leave reviews, however this instance justifies a poor review. Did I mention they reuse their ordering menus by using white out? Overall not a positive experience."}
{"text":"I would always go to Yen because after hitting up every sushi joint in town they were always fantastic and their happy hour was phenomenal. .. Until one day we saw this little hole in the wall sushi joint next to the liquor store called Sushi Catcher! Happy hour all day, incredible prices for even some rolls that I've seen for $7 more at other places, and the staff is friendly courteous, helpful, and fun. Twice a week I need to eat their Vegas Rolls...no other local joint makes Vegas Rolls like this.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Came in after reading the positive reviews and a few recommendations from friends.  Unfortunately ordered the wrong things, but it was still pretty decent.  Small little store with a TV and very attentive staff.  Food came out pretty quick however, it wasn't anything amazing or memorable, at least what I ordered.    I accidentally ordered the Jalapeno bombs under the appetizer selection which was unique, lightly friend, but wasn't very spicy.  I wouldn't get it again since it wasn't very memorable/flavorful.  I also ordered the Albacore roll (accidentally) but this turned out to be pretty decent too, and filling.  Only issue is they don't have many BAKED/HOT roll options as other places do, but they seems to have a lot of daily specials.  If I were to go again, I'd try something different, however I won't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"The garlic edamame is AMAZING! I had the Las Vegas roll and was not disappointed. Yummy! I will be back. They have an all-day happy hour menu and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting sushi places I've ever been to. Not a very well decorated restaurant with only a few seats available, but if you are looking for good sushi, this is your spot. Service was fast and efficient. Overall a great experience. Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"New owners bought this place. No more of KC's great food. I've tried it three times since the new owners have taken over and the sushi is just not great. They kept the same menu but everything tastes different. Every time I have been here I ordered the chirashi bowl and it was always consistent. Since the new owners its about 1/2 the regular size. We ordered take out from here at least once a week and now I will have to start the search for someplace new."}
{"text":"Came to AZ to visit family and had a serious craving for sushi! Being from LA I have access to multiple sushi restaurants , and a lot of great choices at that... But I digress.    After searching yelp for a local spot I stumbled upon this gem! Cute little spot run by some good ol' LA folks! The sushi here is fresh and tasty, coupled with great service... What more could you ask for. Next time I'm in town ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They're holding my refund until I take down this Review.   Sushi catcher.  Oooh man did you guys fuck up. You guys fucked up big time.   Bare with me Yelpers, there's a story here, or if you want, scroll down to the pic/video.  Let's quick recap:  * Food took over an hour.  * Made My wife late back to work. * Had to eat in the parking lot. * Waitress's fortune cookie worth of advice.  * Rotted food.  * $32.95 wasted.  That about sum it up?  So not only did I waste my lunch hour & my wife's lunch hour waiting for our food, then nobody even owned up to it or apologized.   Waitress brings us our check & and this ditty: \"Next time you should call ahead.\"  You really think there's gunna be a \"Next time\"?   Good idea, though, but Maybe if we knew we were coming here before hand.   Maybe if we knew the gentleman sat down 10 minutes after us, got his sushi roll, his soup and his drink before us.  Maybe if we knew you were serving Plague Salad...   And I can totally understand some days shit goes totally blas-ackwards, and back asswards. But fuckin' own that shit, man. Don't try to pass that shit off on me like I did something fucking wrong.   And I was going to let that shit go.   Until You served My wife rotting food.  Rotting food.  You served my wife rotting food. Rotting food you fuckin halfwit.   Are you trying to kill people, you can't serve them this shit.   Guess where that meal went--straight in the fucking trash.  Next time, don't serve me food nobody can eat; just be honest: \" Gris, you don't wanna eat here, just save yourself the trouble & wipe your ass with $32.\" I appreciate honesty, I will happily stand on your table, present myself, & wipe my ass with crisp dollar bills.   ...  Good, yeah, glad we got this out. Thanks for the chat. Yeah. Whew. Good talk. Do you feel better? I feel better. Thanks.  - 4/1/17 [Part 2 Continued]  Ooh! It doesn't get much better then this, kids. Seriously, strap in, you can't make this shit up.   My wife called to ask for a refund. Our waitress hung up on my wife after insisting our ticket was only in for 15 mins wait ( Either she's lying, or she forgot to put in our order until minute 40 of our time there)  Next, my wife spoke with the manager who told her, they would be happy to give us a refund, provided we remove this Review from Yelp...   Dig that shit? They almost poison us & then have the stones to hold my refund hostage?!  Yeah, Sushi Catcher, don't balls-up & accept responsibility or anything lol.  That would be Adulting & we wouldn't want you to do that shit.  Practice good business standards? Parish the thought lol.   ( YELP, that might be of interest to you; I say, They're keeping my refund until I take this Review down. )   So lemme get this straight: Sushi Catcher is charging me $32 to have Freedom of Speech after serving me bad food?   Let me give you that one more again: They are charging Me for serving rotting food that I couldn't eat.   Hmm.   Call it a quick decision but our panel of Judges just voted unanimously--that's right, an 11 Middle-finger Vote--against Sushi Catchers demands.   So that settles it, that's a big Fuck you to Sushi Catcher. This Review stays up & we consider the matter closed.   I gotta tell ya, though, that's gotta be the  best $32 I've spent in a long time."}
{"text":"Met up with some of my west side buddies here before a night out for some quick food and drinks. Our server Vanessa was really nice and funny and I've known Pocholo the sushi chef for awhile so I knew the food would be good. The place is little but the environment was really fun like when one of the guests got a birthday cake brought out the whole restaurant sang along together."}
{"text":"Great rolls! The philly roll and deep fried cali were amazing along with the ebi shrimp. It has happy hour all day everyday now so I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone looking for a new sushi spot  that's how I found it am I'm glad I went there!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Don't judge by the outside! Homey place with friendly staff. Ordered the AZ roll and Buddha's Heartburn roll and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi catcher was a popular spot for MWU students back then. It was a solid 4 stars for me 2 yrs ago. Not sure how did they do to get to where they are now.    I remember a few months ago I suspected new ownership coz of price increases while the rolls look significantly smaller. I was a bit upset and have not been back to sushi catcher ever since. Moving away today so I decided to come for a \"goodbye,\" have to say it was better than last time but the price is still too high.   If you live around and have no other choice, this is still better than Yen sushi imo.. I would recommend the Catcher roll as shown in picture"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently moved to the area, and we have been looking for our go to sushi place for a few months now. After a few bad apples, we have found it! Sushi catcher finally got us out of our bad sushi funk. We tried the Vegas roll, tootsie roll, spider roll, California roll and the eel sashimi. It was all tasty, and had a few stand outs. My fiancé loves eel, and the eel that we were served were big, thick pieces. He loved it. My favorite was the spider roll, I love soft shelled crab but I am used to being disappointed. Not today, the roll was so full of soft shell crab I struggled to eat it in one bite. It was my favorite of the night, and that alone could keep me coming back. Based on Yelp reviews I had thought that they had happy hour all day, but it seems that they have changed that to only being between 3 and 6. Next time we will have to come back in that time."}
{"text":"The food is amazing for the prices! Great customer service also, and very casual. AND HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY!!"}
{"text":"The signage is odd as it doesn't display the name of the establishment. It just says SUSHI. I've driven by this place a million times and finally decided to give it a try only bc Tokyo lobby was closing in 30 mins. It was ok. It's tiny as it seats maybe 30? The sushi was decent. Not the best but not the worst and the service was quick (wasn't very crowded). They said they were open until 10 but by 9 they called 'last call' and by 9:25 they asked us to pay the bill bc they were closing. So we felt rushed out. Probably won't go here again."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Sushi Catcher since first trying their chirashi, even after the priced increased for the chirashi to $16. But the components of the chriashi have changed and changes each time I order the dish. Luckily I found another favorite, the Superman Handroll, otherwise I would stop returning to Sushi Catcher. Another bummer is now Sushi Catcher charges $1 for fresh wasabi when it used to be free."}
{"text":"Deliciously Fresh!  My husband and I found this on yelp and gave it a try. We are still in heaven.  We live about 30 min away, but will drive here for their sushi. They are very friendly and obviously take pride in everything they do and serve. They have the best sushi that I have found in the area. I definitely suggest giving the superman burrito roll a try."}
{"text":"I can't say the food was the best.  It just was OK.  The sashimi Mackerel was partially frozen which turned me off."}
{"text":"This non descript, hole in the wall sushi place was recommended to me and I must say I am impressed. The location is small and can be crowded, but the sushi and prices were top notch. The sashimi was very fresh and delicious and the rolls had immense flavor. I was very impressed for a small place that just says \"sushi\" on the sign lol. I will be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I really liked the sushi.  Chef made an adjustment per request for us.  Fresh ingredients and clean tables.  Can't wait to go again, maybe today!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. oh my g-d. I have been getting sushi from trader joes and Whole foods for the past 2 years and haven't been to a sushi restaurant. I decided to treat myself for my birthday week. and oh my g-d it was delicious. I ordered the salmon roll, spicy tuna roll and the soft shell crab roll. The soft shell crab roll was to die for. The salmon roll excellent. The spicy tuna roll very good. My favorite was the soft shell crab. The spicy tuna was a little tobasco sauce like, so i may not get that next time. But it was still very good.  I'm so excited about this place and will go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is legendary.  Everyone has at least one whole in the wall restaurant that knocks it out of the part... this one is mine."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Sushi Catcher. I came here after Church on a Sunday before I needed to head into work. I was coming from the North Valley area and going to Jobing.com arena, so thanks to Yelp and some navigation, I found this little gem in a strip mall.   Don't be fooled. The outside and, to be honest, the inside of the place look pretty ghetto but the food is great. Plus, Happy Hour ALL DAY!! What? Yes. ALL. DAY. HAPPY. HOUR. Awesome!  There were a few more tables of people sitting in the small place which is always a good indicator, and they all seemed to be rather pleased. I took a seat by myself and was pleased to find out that they give you a complementary salad upon arrival! Yum! The only gripe about the salad is that there was a touch too much of sauce on it, but the sauce was good!   I ordered the Vegas roll, salmon sashimi (6pc) and the Philly roll. They came out in a decent amount of time and were extremely delicious. The sashimi was so fresh and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The Vegas roll and Philly roll were also really good and cooked/prepared to order.   Service was good, and didn't hover which I really appreciated.   The best part about the meal was that I paid only $20 before tip for it all. That, folks, is what I call a slammin' deal."}
{"text":"After relocating from northern California, I have been on the hunt for a new sushi spot. I tried a few nearby places and had no luck until I ran across this gem! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We wanted to find a hidden gem... and struck out. This is the highest rated sushi place in my neighborhood, and unfortunately was far from the rating it is given.  1. As easy as it may be, this place has no online menu. I'm adding pictures of the menu to this review.  2. The menu is extremely limited, and inaccurate. As you can see in the picture, the rainbow roll is listed as having fish... yet it is mostly imitation crab and shrimp.  3. The spicy tuna roll tastes like a side dish served at a Mexican restaurant, heavy on the jalapeños and spices.  4. The udon, a staple at most other Japanese places, was ok though there was no option for adding chicken or any other protein.  Overall, I must either have gone on a very off night or other raters must have been rating another place.  Service was polite."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!! Had excellent Vegas rolls, Tuna rolls and great service. Vanessa was an awesome server! The sauce was so good, so so good. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really wanted to jump on the 5 star bandwagon but alas I can not.    The owners are super nice and very attentive which is a plus.  The sushi however is just so-so.  I ordered a variety of rolls which on the plus side were large but rolled kinda sloppy.  The rice was overly mushy and the shrimp tempura seemed like it was made earlier and microwaved.    Again I would love to give them a higher rating but the flavor was just not there at this visit.  Maybe I will have to reassess at a later date."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for allowing me to find this hidden gem! Seriously the best sushi I've found here in Phoenix. Always fresh and delicious at reasonable prices. I won't go anywhere else for my sushi craving. Staff is great, too. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, this is a great little sushi place. Good price good quality. There is always a happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Business has been sold.   KC and his adorable Wife are gone.  New Sushi Chef prepares food different now."}
{"text":"You know that mythical hole-in-the-wall sushi place, the one run by a local proprietor and serves delicious food at reasonable prices that no one ever knows about? This is that place. I cannot say enough good things about this establishment. First off, the sushi is top rate. Now, I am not saying that it is Japan sushi sensei level good, but it is consistently excellent and very unexpected for the neighborhood. The fish is fresh, the rice is tasty, the portions are generous (for sushi). There are both Japanese and Korean entrees available as well. But the best thing has to be the price - it is happy hour every day, meaning that for $5, you can get a Las Vegas roll, and for $7 you can get a rainbow roll. Chirashi only sets you back $11. And Edamame is complimentary. Seating is limited due to the fact that this is indeed a real hole in the wall, so it can get crowded on weekends. By far my favorite sushi establishment this side of the valley."}
{"text":"I believe this place changed ownership.  The food and service are not what they once where. Still a good value overall"}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't written a review on this place. I grew up going here back when I was younger. But then I moved and my parents and I found a new favorite. This place has improved a lot I have to say. But I still have my favorite place that is unfortunately even farther than this place from my house. But again I was impressed with this place. It's small so not the best idea to bring a bunch of people. It's quieter which I like. The sushi tastes amazing. I wish I had taken a picture so I could post it. If you've never had a sushi with lemon slices on it, you need to try it. I've been obsessed since I tried sushi with lemon slices on it months ago at another place. Good service. They're pretty quick at making the sushi. The dessert looks bomb. All of it. They even seem to have something that seems to be more Thai based. There's a Thai dessert dish, fried bananas with coconut ice cream. They basically have that but it's green tea ice cream. Unfortunately I didn't try it. I wish I had. I actually got the strawberry Mochi. Which is a delicious ice cream thing lol. I recommend getting it. Not all sushi places have this. So I was pleased to know they did. I would give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 1 star due to the fact that not only is it small but I went in today to eat and it was so hot that I decided not to eat here. Management should really consider improving air flow. I will not even give them the opportunity as I am a beer drinker and I dread drinking beer that is cool Vs cold.  I won't be returning. I even told the server that it was really hot inside. She agreed with me but that was it. My wife did eat and she does like it. Not me."}
{"text":"Good cheap sushi.  There is a happy hour. Small location but fast service. In a plaza so decent parking"}
{"text":"Once again, another stellar meal last night. Tried some new rolls this time and nothing disappointed. We were remembered even though we've come in once!  I had mentioned enjoying the fresh wasabi and we had some brought to our table without even asking. That's quality customer service.   Amber jack was just brought in and we had it sashimi style. My husband DOES NOT eat sashimi or nigiri and decided to try it and loved it!! I was shocked. Since he enjoyed it he decided to try some of the \"Screaming O\" I ordered and ended up eating most of it himself. Sushi Catcher has officially made him a sashimi lover.   The highlight hands down had to be the soft shell crab appetizer. It came served with two sauces -- a soy and a creamy sauce. The batter was so incredibly light and flaky, unlike anything we'd ever had before. My husband described it as powder in his mouth. Not an overly crunchy shell and just a succulent inside. Being from the mid-Atlantic, I'm fairly picky about my soft shell crab. Steamed blue crabs with Old Bay are typically my crab of choice, but this is now my number one. No joke. My rurally-raised husband even enjoyed it and doesn't care for crab.   I can not emphasize enough how much I love this place. Although it takes a bit of a drive for us to get there, this is worth the trip every month. I hope the sushi chef sees this and knows how much we appreciate his quality and artistry as we have never had the chance to tell him since he's so busy!  A side note -- my OB told me she is okay with me eating sushi during pregnancy as long as I trust the source and limit the amount of fish I eat each week. We trust Sushi Catcher!!"}
{"text":"Awesome small place. The service is always good, speedy, and the sushi is delicious.!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi along with GREAT service. It's a very small restaurant and I wasn't sure what to expect going in a month ago but it's my weekly sushi fix now! I choose this place over most high end sushi places as well. I used to go to RA quite a bit and I find myself always here now. The prices are so good too. The sushi is perfection and the servers are always so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 5 and it was empty. We ordered the spicy salmon roll, tootsie roll, Las Vegas roll, and omg roll. They were all amazing !!! The spicy salmon was simple but one of my favorites. It's probably the best salmon roll I've had anywhere. The Las Vegas and tootsie roll were also so good. Everything was really fresh and flavorful and the prices were super reasonable , especially during happy hour. It is a small hole in the wall kind of place, but it is clean and the people were very friendly and attentive. I liked that we could go and get sushi without all the frills. New favorite sushi!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Glendale from Central Phoenix, with significant concern about the restaurant scene.  Tonight is the first time that we have ventured out for \"local fare\" (restaurants close to our home) and based on the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try Sushi Catcher.  Well worth the drive.  There are places in the valley with better quality fish, but they are not in our hood and dinners are much more expensive.  This is a small, locally owned shop, with great service and quality food.  Even though the space is simple, it is clean and the service is fabulous.  The food presentation is excellent as well and you can't beat the value.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We had been here about a year ago and didn't love it. Decided to give it another try a few weeks ago and...WOW, it was wonderful! Food was perfect and the staff, especially Cammy, was friendly and knowledgeable. It was so good that we returned less than two weeks later. It was packed. For those with a hearty appetite, on Tuesday's,  all you can eat Sushi for $22.00. For the really brave, for an extra 10 bucks you get unlimited Korean bbq. Personally,  too much but we were obviously in the minority.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent and great service too!  Restaurant was very clean and cute inside.  We tried about 5 different rolls and they were all terrific.  My favorite was the volcano roll.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"In Phoenix on business for a few days. Saw this place on Yelp with positive reviews and thought I would give it a try. Very small place you will drive by if you blink. The sushi was excellent, fast, and the service was great. Very reasonably priced as well. Will be back on future trips."}
{"text":"My second visit here and I was once again REALLY impressed by the quality of the sushi. We ordered: The Alaska Roll, Tuna Roll, Casey Roll, and I requested 2 special order rolls (not on the menu) which the chef made without hesitation, all rolls were delicious! The tuna and salmon were very tasty, fresh, and just melted in your mouth! It's such a laid back and relaxed environment. I'll be here for my weekly sushi trips from now on. The Sushi Master Casey and waiter Alex have awesome customer service and are very attentive to customers' needs. I can't wait to try more items on the menu!  See you next week!"}
{"text":"I ventured in here a few months ago (took notes) and am finally writing a review. I was in the area and was having a serious craving for sushi. Needless to say, this is one of, if not the highest rated sushi bar in Glendale, so I took the bait. Anyway, my first impression was a busy restaurant with terrible fluorescent lighting and barren walls. The awful, whining sounds of country music playing overhead leaving me wondering why the hell I was listening to country music in a Japanese restaurant. Who knows.   Anyway, I sat down and was promptly greeted by my server. She took my order and rushed off to the next table. I noticed that KC, the sushi chef, was cranking out orders one after another. His cuts were precise and his methods were fluid. I was getting excited thinking that I would soon be trying that very sushi he was preparing.    Crab & Cucumber Salad = Tasty & complementary. Low sodium soy sauce = nice to have. white pickled ginger = my favorite, I hate the pink stuff. salmon nigiri = fresh. and a generous portion. sushi rice = not too shabby.  rainbow roll = large and fresh.   The service ended up being a bit shoddy throughout the night, but I suspect that the girl was a bit overwhelmed with the rush. She seemed absent but might have just been thrown off by my style of ordering one item at a time from the bar while I enjoy my beer+saki. She did however load me up with ginger when I asked for extra.   I would give the service a 3.5/5   I give the atmosphere a 2/5  I would give the food a 4.5/5  Oh and for salmon nigiri and a rainbow roll my total was only $12...   Price = 5/5.   If I am ever in Glendale, I will most definitely be back and I would recommend anyone to come enjoy some fresh, quality sushi!!    Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! This place definitely hit the spot for my sushi cravings.  They started us off with complementary cucumber and imitation crab salad. It was okay. Since it was free, we didn't complain. We ordered salmon and yellowtail sashimi. The fish is fresh. They gave us thick slices of salmon and yellowtail. Delicious! My mom liked it so much she ordered a lot more sashimi -- she usually shares an order of sashimi with me but she wanted her own! They gave us complimentary fresh wasabi along with our sashimi. Most sushi places I go to would charge extra for fresh wasabi.   The rolls were pretty good. I liked the Sex on the Beach roll. There's scallop inside and topped with salmon. One of my favorite combination! I enjoyed the Las Vegas roll too. It was only $5! It was crunchy and delicious. The Volcano roll was another favorite with my family. It's a California roll topped with baked lobster and shrimp. It was flavorful and filling.   To top off the meal, we were given complementary mochi ice cream. Whattttt? This place has definitely won me over. The service was great. I'd definitely come back whenever I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Happy Hour ALL day long here. HH includes also non fried items, unlike other sushi HH places. Delicious rainbow roll $7 and spicy tuna hand roll $4. :)  Get this you can order HH to go!! Say what?!?!  It may not be the best or near best sushi, but the deals are great as well as Chef and Owner: KC! Greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I like the idea of happy hour all day long. The people who work there are friendly as well.   My friend and I shared a Tootsie roll, Rainbow roll, and spicy tuna. All of them were delicious. I'm hoping to try the Hoedeopbap next time!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is solid. Not a five star revelation but a solid four stars.   Similarly, the service was prompt and friendly.   The three star rating is because the ambiance.  I wanted to enjoy this place more, but the cramped quarters and distracting neon sign in the back made the meal less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I've had in AZ!  It actually reminded me of the quality of sushi I'm used to from Hawaii.  High quality, fresh, thick cuts of sushi.  Get the sweet shrimp, I always love the fried shrimp heads."}
{"text":"Service was great. We sat at the bar and the waitress came to greet us within seconds. She brought our drinks and a cucumber salad very quickly. She recommended and helped us choose our rolls. The sushi chef was right in front of us so we got to watch him make the rolls and he handed them to us once he was done.  The california roll was good but nothing special. The shrimp tempura roll was the best I've had. Big pieces of shrimp in tempura batter. There was a sweet sauce on top that was to die for! The Dragon roll was awesome! Took longer to make but was worth the wait. It had huge pieces of eel and avocado on top of a large roll. A bit difficult to eat in one bite but worth it.  The restaraunt is very small and in a strip mall. After being there for five minutes all the tables filled up. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and we did too! We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! the cute servers are very friendly and the Sushi is delicious! The scallop roll is my favorite roll of all rolls. You can't beat having Happy Hour ALL DAY either."}
{"text":"OMG! So good! The fish is so fresh that if the owner/chef doesn't think it's fresh enough, he comps the dish.  Happy hour prices all day.  Closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"A great little gem in Glendale. Not overwhelmingly expensive either and the food is really fresh. A great option if you want sushi in town for sure!"}
{"text":"Nope. Went for dinner tonight. The place was dirty. The sushi was very poor quality and now my husband has food poisoning. The sushi was on par with what you buy from a grocery store. Oh and there was a hair on our menu. Gross. Go to Yen's!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a gem. It's a little hole in the wall sushi joint with some of the freshest sushi I have ever had. My boyfriend and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was awesome.  The food was GREAT.  Really glad I picked somewhere I usually don't go.  The jalapeno poppers were the bomb diggity!"}
{"text":"Love this little place that rivals Yen Sushi down the street for quality but dominates for price and service. Sushi Catcher is more of a Cafe or dine and the Happy Hour all day makes sushi on a budget totally doable.  As always with Sushi, we ordered way too much of it. I highly recommend the Vegas Roll and Tootsie roll...SO good.  The Rainbow Roll is OK, but for $7 (compared to $3-$5 I would definitely pass and get something else), unless you really want a sampler.  I'd skip the Casey roll too...kinda funny that the two most expensive ones were all of our least favorites.   Pros: service, price, quality, atmosphere Cons: Nothing"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to tell you guys about this place. Such is my greed to have a seat when I go back. Think \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" as far as the smallness and inconspicuousness of the place (in a strip mall). But just like in \"Jiro\" (who's place is tucked away in the Tokyo subway) this place delivers big on sushi satisfaction.   Prices are very solid for what you get. We were going to get some straight sashimi, but the bento boxes looked so good and were such an amazing value we went that way. Salmon teriyaki, 6-piece sashimi, rice, soup and salad. The sashimi came out first SEPARATE from the bento box. It was not an after-thought. it was in a bowl on it's own bed of ice and was amazing and fresh. The chef also sent over a complimentary creamy cucumber and crab salad with sesame seeds that was out of this world. The service was so friendly that it felt like we'd been there before. To top it all off, they also gave us a complimentary mochi and whip cream dessert at the end of the meal that took me to sushi/japanese cuisine nirvana.   It's hard to squeeze 5 stars out of me, but this place did. I can imagine doing a \"Groundhog Day\" (remember Bill Murray in that?) where I came back to this place every day at the same time forever... and that would be just fine. Save me a seat. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Great sushi great price! I've been coming here for a little over a year and I love the food and the staff"}
{"text":"Fresh, inexpensive sushi in the Glendale/Peoria area. The staff is very friendly and the sushi is very good. The happy runs all day everyday. Spicy tuna is $3 and more elaborate rolls such as the scallop is $5.95. This is my favorite sushi place in the area. It's not glamorous, but it's perfect for great sushi."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. A coworker and mine were just out to find some sushi, and it was delicious. The service was great, and above all, it was super reasonable! We had four different rolls and they were all fabulous. The house salad was quite large in comparison to similar restaurants, and the edamame had great flavor too!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi and very friendly service. Excellent prices. Small dinning area and located in a strip mall, but don't let that bother you. You will certainly enjoy the food."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE FOR SUSHI IN GLENDALE. I had a really hard time finding a fresh sushi place coming from California. Everywhere else I tried had stale tasting fish that I could not finish. I enjoy their caliente roll, salmon sashimi & garlic edamame. The only reason I give 4/5 stars is that I have had better sushi in southern california."}
{"text":"This place is no longer happy hour all day. *sad face* Happy hour is now Monday - Saturday 3pm - 6pm. It can be slightly pricey outside of happy hour. They have also added new items to their menu. The tonkotsu ramen was surprisingly decent - not the best I ever had, but satisfies the craving; definitely perfect for a chilly day. My boyfriend loves the chirashi, which is a big bowl of sushi rice with tons of fresh fish. The soft shell crab was tasty, but wasn't worth the $6. Remember to check-in on yelp to get a free complimentary edamame dish."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good!  just moved from Cali like 2 months ago...decided to go check this place out with the boyfriend. We were skeptical at first but once our food arrived it had a nice presentation and the sushi looked pretty fresh. Food took a little while but I don't know if it was because we were starving lol. Overall it was a great experience, we ordered spicy tuna, 2 Philadelphia rolls, tuna roll and rainbow roll. Reasonable prices ended up paying around $30 drinks included. Must try! Happy hour all day... Oh P.S if you like chef specialty rolls, don't expect it here.. They stick to the basic stuff really."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday, so it of course it was busy. No waitress sat my boyfriend and I down, so we sat ourselves at the bar. Our drink orders weren't even taken until 20 min after we sat down and by then we were already ready to order. People who showed up after us got their order taken before us.   Aside from the horrible service, after ordering I got my food shortly after I was very impressed. Food was delicious, and prices are very great. Will definitely come again and give this place another try but maybe when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Been here for over a hour and a half waiting for food while the place isn't busy. Brought rolls out 15 mins after one another. Had to fend for out own napkins and silverware. Had to plead with the waiter to get water. Never checked it with us. Food was tasty though, nothing spectacular for the price."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and delicious sushi! They have reasonable prices too. So Yummy!"}
{"text":"We went here again on a quiet Wednesday evening. We got our sushi in the boooooat! I ordered one less roll and I was still full. I tried the Las Vegas roll this time and it was delicious. 5 rolls for $25---can't beat that."}
{"text":"This is the second restaurant we have gone to solely on the basis of Yelp reviews, and the second time that Yelp has given us a new favorite spot. If you're looking for a casual sushi place in the West Valley that won't break the bank, this is the place to go. Rather than feeling like an extravagant meal, this really was casual sushi. But, it was GOOD.   Every order we had was done well, flavored well, and presented carefully. The service was friendly without being overbearing. At one point the waitress saw me struggling with my chopsticks and brought me over a little helper and put it on for me.  As for the prices, Sushi Catcher has an all the time happy hour menu. Standards like California rolls are $3-6 apiece, for generous portions. Non happy hour specialty rolls were a bit more expensive, but the portions were a little larger too.  Not sure if it was because it was our first time, or because we plowed through 6 orders of sushi, but the waitress brought us a complimentary mochi ice cream for dessert. Now that we've had it, we will definitely order it again. Calling this ice cream isn't quite right. It was balls of creamy custard-type ice cream encased in what tasted like a gummy shell but turned out to be a rice shell of some sort. I have no idea what kind of wizardry was involved, but I'm a fan.  This place is pretty nondescript on the outside. It is on in the shopping plaza on the north side of Bell but the outside only says \"Sushi\". You have to get right up to the door to see \"sushi catcher\". The place is small and probably would only seat 30 people or so, but was squeaky clean and all of the fish and other ingredients looked and smelled fresh. Several of the people who were there looked to be regulars."}
{"text":"We are back at sushi catchers again this time with 6 guests, food and service could not have been more fresh, squid legs, oysters, uni, and spicy tuna bites all amazing plus the other 25 items we encountered as we navigated through the menu. We will keep going back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner this evening. Was disappointed, we have been there many times in the past and it was awesome. Service was not to good, waitress did not know the menu. Soup was suppose to come with an entree, it did not. She did bring it out, after it was brought to her attention.  If you like rap music played loudly as dinner music, then this is the place for you.  Sushi fell apart, and alittle heavy on the pepper on the chicken and beef teriyaki bowls. I didn't really understand the pepper as a predominant spice for those dishes.    Waitresses and chiefs that were there in the past were amazing, they knew the menu, and the products that were on the menu. Things have changed and it was disappointing"}
{"text":"Fresh fish, reasonable prices and great service. Couldn't really ask for more from this little hole in the wall. Found this from another Yelper's review.  We got the $35 sushi boat along with the screaming O roll and the Buddha's heartburn. This is my new go to spot"}
{"text":"After a long day of driving, my boyfriend and I were craving some Japanese food. So, a quick look-up on Yelp, and we found this place. I have to admit, we drove straight past this place without even seeing it and even when our map directed us to the plaza, we still thought we were in the wrong place. The signage outside really made me want to turn around and leave, but I had to trust the reviews!  The restaurant is quite small, with only a few tables and some seats at the bar. When we came, there was only one other couple, so we had our choice of tables. We were immediately greeted by our waiter, who offered us a few suggestions of things to get. We decided on a chicken teriyaki bento with veggie tempura, along with a tootsie roll and a salmon roll. A few minutes after ordering, he brought over a miso soup (which was included with the bento) and two little dishes of cucumber salad and imitation crab. The miso soup was pretty watery and didn't have much flavor at all, but the cucumber salad was really tasty. I ate my dish as well as my boyfriend's.  My boyfriend enjoyed the chicken teriyaki. He said it wasn't dry and overcooked like some tend to be at other restaurants. The veggie tempura was nice and crisp and wasn't soggy. I thought it was kind of weird that the tempura dipping sauce was cold and not warm? Unless they are usually cold and I'm not remembering correctly? It was a little odd to have a piping hot piece of tempura with a cold dipping sauce. The tootsie roll was good, the shrimp was perfectly cooked. My favorite was the salmon roll because it tasted so fresh. I know a lot of technique and ingredients don't go into a plain salmon roll, but I liked it the best. Sometimes, its hard to pull off simple rolls.  We were really happy with all the food we got and were even happier when we got the check because we were expecting to pay a lot more! It was definitely worth trying this place!"}
{"text":"After consuming both the smoked salmon nigiri and the mackerel I was very pleased. The addition of a garlic based sauce and prior marination of the mackerel was a nice touch. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good sushi at a great price! They have many popular rolls on the all day happy hour menu for $5-7 each.  As far as taste goes this sushi is definitely good. While it probably wont be winning any awards for best sushi ever it will definitely win a spot in my weekly lineup for great spots to have lunch. The inside is pretty small I think only 8 tables; 2 of which only seat 2. The staff is friendly and really polite but when busy can sometimes use a reminder to refill your glass. Not a big issue.  I've been to at least 4 other suhi places in the area and this is hands down my favorite. If your looking for a place to go get sushi in glendale this is it!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sashimi! Large, thick cuts of melts-in-your-mouth fish.   This was our first visit here, and we'll definitely be back. This place is an unassuming small restaurant in a normal-looking strip mall. You wouldn't ever expect such great tasting food in this place... But come ready for your taste buds to be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"First time here! This place is very small and a small menu but... It's fish and small plates our good. That's it. I'll be back for my fresh sea urchins."}
{"text":"Thought we would try a new sushi place for lunch yesterday.  Not impressed.  The young lady who took our order looked disinterested to be there.  Must be the same young gal mentioned a few days ago in another post.  I had a two piece Bento Box with terrayaki chicken and spicy tuna.  The salad was unremarkable but the rice was good and fresh. My spicy tuna was fresh but seemed to lack flavor, incredibly bland.  The chicken was good.  The wasabi was VERY fresh, probably the highlight.   My wife seemed satisfied with her spicy tuna and my daughter was kinda' meh with her California roll.    The restaurant was well worn with broken pieces of black/white tile visible and not much attention to detail on cleaning.  I took a quick trip to the restroom and found it clean and neat.  My wife wouldn't mind going back but she'll have to find someone else to go with her.  Too many better choices around."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Nice and fast service. Clean restaurant but very small place. There is not much room between table. Friendly staff. We will go back for sure. There are like 4 counter seats and 6 tables for 4 and 2 tables for 2."}
{"text":"Went here tonight (Tuesday), got spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll, jalapeño something, and salmon nigiri. We started with gyoza and seaweed salad. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about - it was pretty crappy. The place smelled funky when we walked in but we read all the great reviews so we decided to stay.the atmosphere didn't bother me but it certainly didn't add anything to the experience either. Food came out pretty quickly but we were the only ones ordering when we got there. The salmon pieces were big, but not the freshest tasting - and the seaweed salad was just average. Gyoza was mostly cabbage (more like an egg roll) and came with a cilantro dipping sauce that was thick and weird but if you like cilantro you might like it. Overall, we agreed that we'd never come back and we'd rather go to M sushi just up 59th."}
{"text":"There is a serious lack of delicious sushi restaurants in the West Valley, so when I saw Sushi Catcher listed as the \"Best in the West\" in Phoenix magazine, I immediately wanted to try it.  We visited on a Friday around 5pm.  I was worried that it would be packed because the article in PHX mag had just come out, but there were only two tables occupied when we arrived.    We ordered large beer and saki combos which were only $5 a piece.  They brought us complimentary cucumber and crab salads to start, which were so vinegary and delicious.  We completely over ordered here because we are used to small sushi rolls at every place we go.  We were not ready for the magnitude of the rolls at Sushi Catcher.  We also ordered Gyoza, which came with this heavenly cilantro/spicy/sweet pepper dipping sauce that was so good I wanted it pumped into my veins.  The rainbow roll was to die for.  One roll that I nor my husband were fans of was the scallop roll with salmon on top.  I love scallops when they are cooked, but when they aren't, the texture and flavor was enough to make me gag.  I couldn't eat more than one piece of this roll.  I just took the salmon off the top and ate it sashimi style.    They brought us a complimentary sampling of mochi ice cream in a couple of flavors and a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle after the meal.  The mochi was a little like the ice cream was surrounded by the squishy inner-part of a jelly bean.   Over all, we loved most of the meal, but I'll have to go back one more time, maybe order a bento box, in order to push my review up to five stars."}
{"text":"Best sushi on the Westside. They are almost hole-in-the-wall in size and decor but they serve up some delicious rolls and they price everything ridiculously low. Other places would only put California rolls on their HH menu but the $4 spicy tuna roll is like something you'd pay double for elsewhere. I probably sound like a cheap ass right about now but I wasn't always able to make it rain big face hunnreds on chicks like I do erryday, so I stay value-conscious. Try the spicy scallop roll and maybe some Soju if you aren't driving. The lady who runs the place always gives me a bottle of sake to go. I hope they stay in business for a long, long time. I love this place."}
{"text":"So this place I would have never found without Yelp. It's tucked away in a pretty dilapidated strip mall type setting. Don't let appearances fool you though the quality here is killer.   The atmosphere is very quaint. it's a little small mom-and-pop place and you can tell they really care about the food.   they have all the regular types of sushi and a bunch of house types in specials.   The happy hour is out of control from 3 to 6 p.m. so come during those hours and get your grub on."}
{"text":"I've only had three items here and they were amazing. The spicy tuna bites are unbelievably delicious. It's hard to find good spicy tuna in this side of town. Their gyoza dumplings are delicious, and so is the beef yakisoba!! I haven't tried their sushi rolls but I am definitely anticipating my next opportunity. I don't base my reviews on service but the cooks seem to be lazy procrastinators (not the sushi chef). I'll update my review in the future; if I need to."}
{"text":"I have lived in Peoria for four years and am moving next week and I am going to miss this place the most. I used to come with mu roommate multiple times for linch a week. The quality of the sushi is excellent especially for the price. Everything is great! My favorite rolls were the sex on the beach, rainbow roll, and superman burrito. The bento boxes and the chiriashi are fantastic also. I don't think I'll ever find a place for sushi that i will love as much as Sushi Catcher."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! People are the best and the food cannot be beat! Real wasabi an amazing hideaway!"}
{"text":"Sushi overall was really good and I'd come back here. I had the spicy tuna which was great and also the California with cream cheese baked which was also tasty. I don't recommend their spicy tuna appetizer bites. The rice tasted like ginger and it was too bulky to eat. Didn't like the flavor.  Prices overall are not bad, happy hour is decently priced but not huge discounts."}
{"text":"A fairly new sushi restaurant, open only six months.  Owner used to be sushi chef at Tokyo Lobby, Casey has opened an outstanding local sushi establishment.  With happy hour pricing all day, this should be a very popular sushi restaurant in the northwest side of the valley, well worth the drive from any north or west valley location. Menu selection is simple but extensive with the standard sushi, sashimi, and traditional rolls plus a great selection of specialty rolls.  Look for this sushi eatery to grow in popularity.  On our first visit, the place was packed.  Not exactly a large restaurant, but big enough to be cozy.  My wife and I ordered 4 rolls and it was served to us on a boat, which other restaurants serve on individual plates.  It made us feel special.  A lite cucumber and crab meat salad accompanied our meal.  We were impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant, the quality of the sushi, the friendliness of the staff, and the location near home.  I am going to recommend Sushi Catcher to my Sushi Club and I recommend it to you as well."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment based on high praise from yelpers and some friends of ours. It wasn't bad, but it was pretty mundane. My wife and I tried some of the more unusual, non-traditional offerings like [whatever it was called, their website is broken right now and I can't refer back to the menu. But it was an eccentric roll of some kind that had shellfish and other miscellany piled high on top] ranged from not very good at all to downright awful. Soggy sushi that you can't eat without a spoon is a very unappetizing thought  But the other, more orthodox sushi options were quite good, but no better than most other places I have been.  I was lured in also by the advertisement that it is \"always happy hour\", which was clever, but once you consider that \"if it is always happy hour, it never is\" and then notice that all it really means is a section of items on their sushi menu priced maybe 50c to $1 less than average it isn't as impressive.   I don't think this place is bad by any means, but I am perplexed as to why it has such high praise when I would describe it as average at best."}
{"text":"We love Tokyo Lobby just down the street, but after reading others' reviews, wanted to try this place and am glad we did. It was very good. The Happy Hour all day long everyday is my type of place. We had 4 rolls and all were very good... our kids had the teriyaki chicken and my wife thought the chicken was so tender she'd order some next time too. Very small and not fancy, but that doesn't matter to us. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is going to hate that I'm leaving this review because we like to call this \"our spot\" but I thought everyone on Yelp should know how amazing this place is.  I'm not going to start with how amazing the sushi is just yet...First, I love how at home we feel every time we go in.  I have to admit I was a little skeptical of trying a sushi place in this shopping center but boy was I wrong, VERY wrong.  The people here are simply amazing and the price is just right!  Ok, now for the sushi part, I'm in love...here's a list of our top favs (not in any particular order) and hopefully they will become your favs too!  1.Superman Burrito Roll 2.Volcano Roll 3.Superstar 4. Casey Roll"}
{"text":"My new favorite local sushi place. Went here for dinner and had their Volcano Roll, Yum-Yum roll, and Rainbow Roll, which were part of their \"All Day Every Day Happy Hour\". Although I wouldn't say the bill was very \"Happy Hour\"ish, I still thought the quality was quite good. The sashimi was fresh and cut well, the waitress was very friendly, and the Yum Yum (raw scallop) roll as well as the Volcano roll was my favorite :]   This restaurant is great for that quick lunch/dinner with 2-3 people, but doesn't look like it could accommodate larger parties. Nevertheless, I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and accommodating. The food was tasty as well. We will go back again for sure"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley.  Great service and the food is always prepared as expected.  The only place in Arizona to get good sushi.  Great prices as well!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Catcher many times by now since I live in the area and love sushi. This little hole-in-the-wall is one of my favorite places! Most recently, a friend and I went for dinner. We were greeted and served water promptly, and the waiter gave us time to decide what we wanted. Between the two of us, we ordered 5 rolls off the happy hour menu (which is available all day- yay!) and egg rolls to split. It was only $30 between the two of us!! What a deal! The sushi is always fresh and delicious, and never tastes like it was made with frozen ingredients or pre-made. My only complaint is that my water didn't get refilled once on my last visit, but that can happen anywhere that is busy. I'd definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was shocked when I walked in and saw how small this place is. Don't be deceived by the looks, this isn't just another sushi joint in a strip mall, this place is a solid Japanese restaurant. They not only have sushi, they have poke, bento boxes, ramen and bowls. I had he spicy tuna bowl and it was exceptional. The tuna was fresh and tasty. They dress the rice with sesame seed oil and soy sauce to perfection. I can't wait  to comeback and try everything in the menu!"}
{"text":"Decor:  It is in a strip mall, and doesn't look like much on the outside. Inside is a bit better, but small. Nothing too fancy but also nothing too terrible.  Service:  Service was top notch. They were attentive enough when they needed to be, and left us alone when they needed to be.   Food:  Food was great for the price. Is this the best sushi you will ever have? No. Are their rolls creative and tasty? Yes. The burrito roll was amazing!  All in all, if you are on this sound of town and are looking for good sushi that is not gonna cost you and arm and a leg, then head over here."}
{"text":"Sushi fix was satisfied yesterday. Sometimes ambiance is not needed. Rolls were delicious and fresh especially the volcano roll. I have been caught by the Sushi Catcher."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and wonderful. Didnt have to wait very long and the staff was very friendly. The Sushi Chef, Po, was very knowledgeable and friendly. He made the sushi perfect. I have tried many sushi places in hopes of finding sushi that brings me back to Hawaii and Po definitely achieved that for me. Dont hesitate to go in for quick bite or an extravagant dinner. Its definitely my go to spot."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for their happy hour deals. However, the service has ALWAYS been pretty bad, even when it is not packed. Honestly, even if it is packed a decent server should be able to manage the entire (tiny) restaurant.   Usually the sushi/sashimi is good, this visit it was subpar. The fish was discolored like they took it out from the freezer and defrosted it... gross. I read that they changed owners so maybe that is the problem with the quality of product. Will not go back. There are plenty of other options."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly before their open time of 11:30am.  At 11:40 they still had not unlocked the door.  Just befire 11:45 they unlocked the door and we went in, seating ourselves with no staff in the dining area.  We sat for about 15 minutes before a server came to our table and asked for our drink order.  Several minutes later the same server came for our order.  Both of us ordered the chicken bento box lunch with California rolls.   We heard the server tell the chef we wanted California rolls, not telling him we ordered the bento box.  I had to tell the chef we ordered the chicken bento box lunch. When our lunch arrived and I started eating the teriyaki chicken, I found a very long hair in the food (see the picture).  I put it aside and finished my lunch.  About this time a new server arrived that was much more efficient than the first.  I pointed out the hair to her and she appeared upset and offered to comp my meal, which I declined. The bento box lunch was supposed to come with 2 gyoza dumplings which were not delivered.  I mentioned this to the chef and he apologized and soon we were served the missing dumplings. The food was just ok, but the service was terrible.  It appeared that they were not ready to open and the first server was one of the kitchen staff. Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"One of my top sushi places still because food and service is consistent. Yes! Happy to eat here, always leave happy.   Happy hour is 3-6 pm now, but they have lunch specials mom-fri 11-3, and their menu now is much more extensive :)  Soft shell crab, fried calamari, tonkatsu ramen, tofu tempura, yakisoba, the list goes on and everything I've tried here is so good!"}
{"text":"I love this place for good inexpensive sushi. It is really casual but they have amazing pricing for really good sushi  they have happy hour specials that run all day and different specials they have also added to the menu. Their chirashi is very good as well. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This place is really good. We went there last night because of the all day happy hour. There were a ton of selections for rolls under the happy hour. There were also a lot of different kinds of rolls not on the happy hour menu that you could choose. We got a shrimp tempura roll, california roll, vegetable roll, and a mexican roll. I did not care too much for the vegetable roll, it  lacked a little flavor. I guess I would have liked more of tempura style veggies in it. The rest of the rolls were very good. The price was excellent. My husband had a bento box with teriyaki chicken. He said it was pretty good. The salad did not have the ginger dressing we liked, and we are used to getting tempura veggies in the boxes but the chicken was good.  The service was very friendly. One complaint is there were no descriptions for the sushi, so I had to keep asking what was in each roll.  Overall a good experience and we will be back cause of the price."}
{"text":"Another great meal, this time with a couple of friends. Our friends are newer to sushi on a whole but they were blown away by the creative things KC setup for us. We tried a few new things and my friends had a white tiger roll amongst many, other rolls.   I think they just found their new honey hole for sushi. I was happy to take them.  Hospitality again was bang on, service as we needed anything, I normally drink their cold green tea and I never was without. Saba, again was perfect and flavorful - we had more sashimi this time. Everything was flavorful and tasted fresh.   Here is the kicker with this place. For sushi, in the valley it is really reasonable. We have other choices in the Surprise / Glendale area but for my money and either way I have to drive somewhere to get sushi, they get my business. They have the right combination of not being too big, not having too many crazy rolls (he does make creative things but he doesn't have 10000 rolls, and almost all of them are NOT DEEP FRIED) and really good quality fish.   It is an intimate experience in a small restaurant with people that really value you being there. I think in the last month I've been there 4 times and they always make us feel like we're guests in their home, and they serve us with such care you just want to go back.  Little touches like mocchi after the meal, light salads to start, heck this time the sweetheart even gave us a bottle of sake to take home with us, as a thank you.  They have set a really high standard that I hope they can keep. It definitely seems like they have all of the kinks worked out and they are definitely firing on all cylinders.  Also, it was a tuesday, after 8pm, and the place was steady with take out orders and table orders. A very good sign.  Keep up the excellent work, we'll be back next week :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Not much to look at it doesn't matter when the food is perfect. I live close so I will be going ALL THE TIME. Such a great find!"}
{"text":"Everything I wanted and more. The food was fresh and delicious and they were very accommodating to my family members allergies. Pretty sure this will be my go to place for sushi"}
{"text":"Don't left the outside of the restaurant fool you.  Located in a strip mall, one would probably not give a 2nd look at the place, however, if you go inside, you'll find one of the best sushi in town.  Having lived in both new york and california, I know what good sushi.  Food taste fresh and great service.  Came here multiple times and will be back many times more."}
{"text":"Love this place been there several times now! Must order the boat for hard core sushi lovers!  Happy hour is insanely cheap & all-day too!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is definitely a hidden gem in a random strip mall along Bell Rd! Service here is great! The waiter and the chef are both very friendly. We ordered bento boxes for lunch, and for ~$12-$13/box, the amount and quality of food they include is incredible! There are also cheaper bento boxes that have less items. The ones we chose included 3 selections of food along with the included rice, miso soup, and salad. They basically give you an entire order of a sushi roll with your bento box! Food tasted great. I had the steak teriyaki, and it was delicious! I would definitely stop here again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! So good, we had the Jalapeño bomb, shrimp and salmon tempura rolls, the tuna and Salmon sushi, fried rice, and edamame...don't judge us!! But it was all delicious we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was nervous trying sushi in Arizona after moving here from San Diego, but I couldn't hold in my cravings any longer!  This place is near our apartment and is in a tiny shopping center. You'd pass it if you didn't know where you were going. My favorite roll is the Superman Burrito roll. I think its salmon, tuna and avocado wrapped in some sort of rice paper (not the traditional seaweed wrap) with a delicious dipping a sauce! I always get this roll when I order. All the rolls I've had are delicious! The prices are fantastic and the staff is nice. Definitely a place I recommend! I'll be going to this place for a long time. :-)"}
{"text":"Best sushi so far. Drove from Scottsdale twice this week. The jalapeño bombs are the bomb. Their food is fresh and full of flavors. You can't do wrong within anything on their menu. Also great prices."}
{"text":"Got this for takeout and the sushi was very good and I felt the price was reasonable. The actual dining area is very small, so not good for a ton of people, a bit of a hole in the wall, but the service was friendly and the sushi chef is right there in front of you which is nice. I wish their website was comprehensive of all the rolls they have; what you see online is not all that they have. Online they have mostly other entrees listed, and they don't have any to go menus, so I took a picture of the sushi menu as I was leaving. Left the one star off for the confusing website; hopefully they update it, and I will order takeout (and also dine in) even more frequently once there is a description and comprehensive list of all the rolls they have. The ones I did manage to order were good, so I can only imagine the others are too."}
{"text":"By far some of the best sushi you can get in Phoenix, AND for a good price. If I'm low on cash but still want delicious sushi, I come here for their Happy Hour specials (which are all day, everyday). They also have awesome special rolls, bento boxes and \"boats\" for larger parties. The ambience is always pleasant and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"a little pricey but the roles were decent, very small space is my biggest complaint. Server did his best but was very busy and unable to keep up with the crowd. Good sushi just not somewhere I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp last night. I am out of town and wanted decent sushi. This place was fantastic. The sushi chefs and rest of the staff were very kind and helpful too. Next time I am in town we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There are several recent yelps that indicate a change in ownership, but this was our first time to Sushi Catcher based upon a recommendation by a friend. Not sure what this friend was recommending but this place is horrible. When you walk in you notice it's a hole in the wall, but that doesn't always mean bad. However, the first table we sat at was so shakey we had to move to the bar. Unfortunately, the bar counter is small so we piled used plates to the side. By the way, these plates were never removed. See pic. There was only one server for the entire place and she was clearly not happy about it. There was only one sushi chef as well. And, as other yelpers have indicated, it's way too warm in there. For starters, everything coming out of the kitchen sucked. The cucumber sunumono had ponzu sauce instead of sweet vinegar. A personal pet peeve of mine especially when the menu says vinegar. The edamame was slightly wok grilled but way under cooked; at least half of them were inedible because they were too hard. So we thought, okay, other sushi places have poor kitchens but great sashimi (eg, Yellowtail). First, sashimi was delivered after the sushi rolls. That's a rule, maybe unwritten, but still a rule. The rolls were rather bland, could have used some spicey sauces on some; the sashimi was not fresh, the yellowtail was slimey. The prices are cheaper than most, but there is a reason. Back to Sakana & Tokyo Lobby."}
{"text":"We were looking for a ramen place near us....and we scored big time! Amazing simply doesn't cover it all.  We had the tempura tofu, goyza and ramen. All of it was great.  So very glad we stopped here. We will be back.  Fully recommend this place. It's worth it.  Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Had a sushi craving and went for something new since my usual go to place is Tokyo Lobby down the street. I saw this place had good ratings so Why Not?   The staff was very friendly and greeted us immediately once we got in. I LOVE when they do that because it welcomes the customer and makes us feel wanted. We loved that our server mentioned the specials and their all day happy hour menu.  They had some pretty good deals! We ordered 2 Las Vegas, 2 Philly, 1 spicy tuna, 1 avocado roll, 2 miso, vegetable tempura, and 2 drinks. The grand total was $40!! Which is great for all that food!   Now onto the flavors.  Well I immediately noticed that the rolls where a bit on the slim side. They hardly had any avocado or cream cheese inside.  I love my rolls to be big and stuffed to the hilt!! So big that I can't fit it in my mouth. But that was not the fact here. So that was a bit of a downer. The flavors were ok. I really enjoyed the tempura and avocado roll. Everything else was ok.   If you like great deals on sushi, then this place is great! But if you want rolls that are HUGE, packed with flavor, and you need to bite it in half to eat, then try Tokyo Lobby down the street."}
{"text":"It's good. Definitely is in my top 5 of sushi places here in Phoenix.  Happy hour all day, i am pretty sure just counts as regular price, so they should take their sign down that says that.  Prices are good, services is prompt. This place is more about the rolls and quantity, which I have no qualms with.  My brother in law got this very interesting salad thing with tuna...It looked soo good, and he said it was too...sorry don't know the name of it."}
{"text":"I've been a sushi addict for most of my life but only sushi catcher can satiate both the needs of my taste buds and my wallet at once. Thanks sushi catcher!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service and the food. There was only the sushi chef and a woman there yesterday afternoon. Chef kept sneezing. Made me nervous. One dish was so hot I had to send it back. Another tasted ok, but looked like a plate of mush. Contrary to what another reviewer said, happy hour is not all day but 3-6.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"I was really craving sushi this week and wanted to try a different place. I called this place up to make sure I had the right address. Their website doesnt really work.  Pros: sushi was delicious, fast service, you can actually taste the calamari in the calamari not just the tempura, free fresh wasabi, friendly, welcoming, they have boats, free small tiny salad and all day happy hour  cons: its tiny, lighting is like a cafeteria, waitresses seemed rushed and small entree menu.   This place was actually really good though. I enjoyed their sushi. will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since we moved to town. This was our favorite place to get sushi, and this breaks my heart, but we won't be back...  We have been steadily watching things go downhill for the past few months (good people behind the line disappearing and replacing them with less-than-friendly staff, dishes getting busted up and not replaced, etc.). BUT, there are two giant TVs now.   Tonight one of the waitstaff reached across my table to pick up a wrapper while I was leaned in to take a bite of my food. Seriously, it's a chop stick wrapper. Not like the glass bottle someone else dropped while bussing...  Some of my rolls fell apart while on my plate. And then to round out a perfect evening, my wife ordered dessert, and it got screwed up. How hard is it to cut two mochi balls and put them on a plate?   So disappointed...."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a friend's recommendation.  Now I am a fan!  A small place with very friendly service (she asked us how we heard about them) that has happy hour rolls ALL DAY (starting at $3).  Prices are very decent and quality (and quantity) are both good!  I liked their variety for bento boxes (there are a lot of combinations to satisfy your cravings)...I had beef teriyaki w/ 6 piece sashimi (fresh!) that comes with rice + salad for $10.50.  I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stumbled upon this place few months ago and boy are we glad!!   The service, the food, the prices... Everything was great! We haven't gone anywhere else for sushi since we found this place!!!"}
{"text":"So. Return I promised, and return I did. Went     Friday night. I'm surprised this place isn't busier. I said I'd order my partner's meal and that is exactly what I did. I got the Bento box with teriyaki steak, pot stickers and the tootsie roll. They start you out with soup that I'm not a fan of but I loved everything in the bento box. The ambience leaves a little to be desired but if you want good food at really good prices, get over there. It's delicious"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and awesome sushi chefs. The seating is limited, if you arrive an hour before closing, it's the best!!"}
{"text":"I been a cutomer for two years! High quality food and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great establishment, just need to give it a little more time.  Was searching for some sushi on my way back from a camping trip, specifically one that offered Happy Hour and stumbled upon Sushi Catcher... they have happy hour ALL DAY EVERY DAY! Wow-- now that's an idea I can get behind.   Happy Hour Menu: -avocado roll, salmon roll, tuna roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp roll, Golden California roll, California roll, shrimp tempura roll, toosie roll, Philadelphia roll, Las Vegas roll, Casey roll and Rainbow roll... ranging from $3 (a good deal) to $7 (not such a good deal).  -large sake bombs are $5,  Atmosphere: -strip mall sushi joint. Definitely not classy, but in a way, that's nice. It's not imposing or staunchy. -owners have children, encourage families to stop in after school, etc. Definitely a change of pace from most sushi restaurants. Kinda fun to watch kids eat sushi-- who knew they'd like it!? -small space, I actually don't know if there's room to sit and eat at the sushi bar, because there's lots of stuff scattered on the countertop.  Service: -A+ very polite and relatively quick getting our food out. -beer for sake bomb was poured for us.  Sushi: -\"OK\" sushi. The presentation was VERY poor, the roll was sliced unevenly with some pieces being very large and others being small. They were also not tightly wrapped. -I'm not a fan of deep-fried \"sushi\" and the Tootsie roll managed to secure that feeling. Not much taste, just alot of cream cheese.  I like the business and the owners and feel like they'll get their sea-legs soon enough. I'll be back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Long time customer but first time posting. Definitely one of my favorite sushi places around! I suggest the superstar roll if your a fan of tuna."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall sushi restaurant in Glendale;  quite a far trek from Tempe. But I love sushi so was willing to give this a place a try.  Cucumber salad was on the house and good. Three of us ordered the rainbow roll, Buddha roll, tootsie roll, Alaskan roll, Philadelphia roll, shrimp tempura roll, shrimp roll, and two pieces of salmon sushi. All the rolls were good. We did notice that they used the fake crab meat in the rolls, but not complaining because our bill totaled $50.00 which is super cheap for how much food we had. If you like to eat sushi on a budget this is your place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place! Since yelpers were raving about it. It's a cute place, few chairs & tables we were lucky there was 1 table left for us. I am not a raw sushi eater, but when I go to sushi places, I always get the baked or fried rolls. They have the best las vegas roll so far and their volcano rolls is loaded with lobster meat and shrimp. My friends had sake bombs, one of them tried the green tea. The green tea was alright, it needs more flavor. We also tried spicy garlic with salmon, shrimp tempura, sex on the beach and golden california. All of them are soooooo good but my most favorites are the las vegas roll and the volcano roll. The price for the  las vegas roll was $5 and 12.95 for volcano roll. Happy hour all day, everyday! Hands down the best sushi place in the west valley (for me)."}
{"text":"Happy Hour All Day, Every Day.  Great selection of happy hour rolls, and a very neat, slightly edgy speciality rolls list.   Service is up to par for a small sushi establishment. Realizing your in NW Phoenix area getting sushi for a great price, you'd think the quality isn't up to par with everything else and thats is where you'd be WRONG!  I've yet to have bad or under quality sushi or sashimi and I've happily dined in over 20 times in the last year.   Rolls to try: Rainbow Roll, Casey Roll, & Las Vegas Roll (all happy hour rolls) And definetly try the Dragon, Mexican, Caterpillar, or Superman Burrito Roll!!!"}
{"text":"1st time there and the food was spectacular!! I always lean more to the sashimi side and it paid off with \"The Catcher!\" I thoroughly enjoyed the Salmon Eggs, a Jalapeño Bomb & and a Sex on the Beach roll!! I will definitely be returning the next time I have the craving for sushi!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the valley. The owners are great. They give tremendous service and always make you feel at home. We usually get sushi and a couple of rolls when we go, and they are so fresh. We like to try a new roll every time and they have yet to disappoint us. It is a small place, so we try and go on off hour times, so we can sit at the sushi bar and talk. Because KC is the only sushi chef right now, he was training a new one the day we were there, The place fills up quick. I've read where people say the service is slow, but sushi is an art and even when it's busy he get the food out in a timely manner. Doesn't any restaurant slow down when they get busy? I would recommend Sushi Catcher to everyone. It's a great small family business."}
{"text":"My man and I ate here for our first time on Saturday and it was a pretty good experience!   When we got there, it took a while for someone to come to our table. It was pretty slow that day, so I was kind of confused. But as soon as she got to us, she came back with our drinks really quickly.  We ordered the Vegas rolls, golden California rolls, tootsie rolls, jalapeño bombs, and fried dumpling. Although they forgot to make our jalapeño bombs, the rolls were all so fresh and DELICIOUS! It totally made up for the slow service in the beginning of our visit. The rolls were fried perfectly and it was at a great price! Also, our server was really sweet and funny.  So basically, the service was okay but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The sake is colder than the actual temperature in this place. It's cramped. Slow and wildly mediocre at best. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was a nice hole in the wall. I am looking forward to coming back. Sushi was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food, clean and simple atmosphere. Portions are quite large...my bento had several moist pieces of salmon teriyaki, just lightly brushed with sauce.   It was our first visit and we both added an extra sushi roll to our boxes. Even though we were ravenous, this was a foolish mood. With one from column a, b, and c, we had more than enough to eat, for a mere $12.50.   That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.   As others have said, this is not a fancy place.  But who cares? We would happily drive past the 10 other sushi options on our 30 minute drive to eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd favorite sushi spots in Glendale.I loved the sushi rolls. The woman serving us was very friendly and nice. Not expensive"}
{"text":"Had the volcano roll and looks not as well made as before. I feel like there was a change in ownership and went down hill from there. The shrimp was your cheap frozen baby shrimp while the lobster looked like scraps of crawfish. Very little of shrimp and so called lobster is placed on top. Rolls were poorly made and fell apart the moment it was picked up. Unfortunate change. Will look for another sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered from here to go and the food was okay. My mom enjoyed it, but it didn't have anything extra that made me love it. I'll be sticking to my favorite sushi places."}
{"text":"OVERALL, sushi isn't that great anymore.... very sad. QUALITY is going downhill while the COST is going up.  They recently raised their prices and changed a few things. For example: -\"Casey Roll\" used to be on the happy hour menu for $6. The new price is $7.50.  -Salmon sushi (6 pieces) used to be $3, but they raised it to $4 (that's ~$0.67 per piece!) -Rainbow Roll used to be $7... It is now $7.50. -Volcano roll used to be $11.95, it is now $12.95. Their are many other rolls they raised too!  Also, I recently ordered the Alaska Roll. The Alaska Roll is a california roll with salmon and pieces of lemon on each piece. HOWEVER, they don't cut the lemon into thin tiny slices like the original owner did. They now cut only two HUGE slices and throw it on top. It really doesn't taste the same like that.... maybe they got too lazy to cut the lemon up into tiny pieces????"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, the craving for sushi was real and Sushi Catcher definitely hit the spot. The Rolls were pretty standard, spider roll, California roll, etc. Portions were pretty large at a reasonable price. I mean the Rainbow Roll was $7! I'm used to seeing that roll in the $13-$15 range so seeing it under $10 made me pretty happy. I want to go back and try their yakisoba specials. Our neighbors were enjoying them and my mouth was watering as I tried not to stare. I also want to try the Poke Bowl. I almost got a giant sushi burrito but I saw our neighbors get it and I changed my mind real quick. it looked like 75% rice, 15% fish/crab and 10% seawood/wrapper. Sounds good in theory but the execution isn't quite there yet.  Service was good as the server checked in on us often, but there was one table in particular that she completely fawned over. I'm not sure if they were family friends or regulars, but the rest of us customers were borderline ignored once they walked in. It didn't bother me too much but it's weird the way the server's demeanor changed so drastically. Regardless, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Overall a good first experience. Our server was not very familiar with the menu and was unable to answer our questions without retreating to the sushi bar area where she could ask someone that knew. The food was good and came out in an acceptable amount of time. Sushi was fresh and portions were good in relation to price. It's a little far from where we live and we probably would not make the trip just to eat here. If we were in the area, it might be different."}
{"text":"Friendly sushi chef and manager. Fresh  food and friendly servers. Gotta come try this perfect whole in the wall eatery:)"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Just went for a quick lunch and everything was delish - fast also! Ahi poke & OMG roll!"}
{"text":"It was empty when we arrived, but I am glad we did not let that decide on whether that meant the food or service was lacking.  Clean restaurant and restroom, Friendly and delicious food is what we received. Free miso soup, and delicious rolls which were on the happy hour menu (ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR!!) My daughter and BF loved it, as did I. Will definitely return =)"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi rolls and great service! The restaurant is tucked into a strip mall so be careful not to miss it!"}
{"text":"Awesome prices, fantastic food.  What else do you need.  Come in and get a bento box and superman roll.  You are set"}
{"text":"VERY small place. Hardly enough room to walk from table to table or sit between tables. But the food is worth it. Came here on Mothers Day night, it was pretty busy.   The decor is nothing fancy at all. Very plain. Two tvs, no sound, on the sports channel. Naturally.   Some things to know, they charge for wasabi. Yes, you read that correctly. But Im going to assume its fresh and its the real stuff, not horse radish. But their prices are fair with everything else. And the flavor of the sushi is great so if you enjoy quality tasting fish, you may not need wasabi anyway. Their yakisoba is cooked very well and comes with either chicken or steak. I ordered albacore, yellow tail, a spicy tuna roll, and the screaming o \"roll\".   All were great. The screaming o is highly recommended for you spicy fanatics. Its seared peppered tuna laying on a bed of crispy rice noodles and spinach. Its drizzled with a spicy dressing and roe. I fell in love with the coloring automatically.  Another thing to note, they dont have soda machines, its canned. But you cant really go wrong with the flavor of canned soda anyway.  Overall, this place is great. Dont let the location or decor fool you. I would suggest coming during happy hour. Which is every day from 3-6pm (I think). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place to go in West Valley. Excellent service, good ambiance , friendly service , clean , and Owner is Super friendly. Most of all great food. Love Love love everything I tried.  MUST COME and TRY!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a sushi place but didn't want to venture to far from home and didn't want to break the bank. I found Sushi Catcher here on Yelp and decided to go in.   Walking in the place is rather small but cozy. I was surprised to see the menu had a lot of great options to choose from poke bowls, noodles, and more.   I decided to try the edamame, spicy miso soup, philly rolls, and volcano roll. To finish the meal I ordered mochi ice cream (strawberry and mango).   I could tell right away that the sushi was very fresh. I would definitely recommend it because the price is fair and the rolls were tasty.   Update: I'm a regular now. Sushi is very consistent."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Total hole in the wall with some of the freshest sushi I have had in a long time. Very friendly service and very kind owners that really care about their clientele! Tootsie roll and spicy tuna were amazing. Cucumber salad was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality fish! I'm from Seattle and definitely a seafood snob. It's obvious they have high quality fish and are awesome at the preparation. I especially appreciate the simplicity of their menu. If you have quality fish, you don't need to masque the flavor with cream cheese, mayo sauces and deep fry. Definitely will be back and recommend without reservation. Actual Asian chefs and clientele another positive plus!!!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi for the price, if you come here and there are a lot of people be prepared to wait. The Owner is the sushi chef and the wife also waits on the tables. They are just starting out and probably can't hire more staff otherwise they will have to charge more for good sushi. Very friendly Owners."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I can't say enough good things about them. The prices are right, the sushi is so tasty, and the veggie rolls/avocado rolls are vegan! I love having a place close by that is good quality and isn't outrageously expensive."}
{"text":"Awful: went in for lunch at 12:15pm. No one was in there just us. We placed a small order and at 1:15pm still hadn't received food. We finally just asked for the bill. No one was in there eating so apparently this may happen a lot. Not sure. We really enjoyed this little place. We won't be back. It's a mess!! No thanks."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall? Yes, but this is one of the best tasting sushi I've had in the valley. We came here with friends and tried Sushi burrito (amazeballs!), crispy tuna, and volcano roll. Every single roll was better than the last. I was told that people drive 40 minutes for the ramen alone, so I will definitely be back. That is a promise!  There is nothing impressive about the location or the restaurant ambiance in fact it was rather uncomfortable which normally I don't care a single bit about if the food is great. The only reason I bring it up is because the food is still very pricey considering. Had the price reflected the lackluster atmosphere, I would've given this place 5 stars in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I will say I've tried 3 sushi places in Az n this is the best. I really liked the las vegas roll & the rainbow.  I even liked the tootsie roll. The heart burn or heart attack was TOO spicy & had some good heat. Rolls poorly put together to where they fell apart from plate to mouth but still good. This will be my pla ce for sushi in Az."}
{"text":"We had the smoked Philly roll, Casino Royal and the Ted roll. My favorite was the Casino Royal, although all were exceptional. Sarah was our server, she was attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"***Update*** Visited today but the owner changed.  I used to love their salmon sushi and it's totally different now. Below average now. Not going to visit anymore I think."}
{"text":"Have been to several sushi places in the west valley and this one tops them all. The sushi was fantastic and priced very reasonably. The service was excellent. $5 sake bombers and the complimentary salad was a great touch. The owner treats you like family from the minute you walk in with a smile and a hug. Will definately be going back."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Arizona! Was super excited to eat it one Monday afternoon, however, and found out they now close on Mondays...literally had us standing in front of the locked door frowning haha So if it's a Monday and you want sushi catcher.... Sad day :("}
{"text":"We stopped in to Sushi Catcher because a friend told us it was good. It's small but clean and inviting. We were greeted by 'Sue' who is the owner along with 'KC' the Sushi Chef.  We let Sue know it was our first time visiting. We heard good things and wanted to see for ourselves. I'm a big fan of Sushi and my wife loves the specialty rolls. We had a very nice time and the environment was friendly. The food was great. I especially enjoyed my yellowtail sushi. I've seen this before this little place has been open for six months and is guaranteed that in another 6mos.- 12 mos. it's going to be hard to walk in and sit down.  They feature fresh wasabi (just ask for some) and Sue even gave us a little bottle of Cold sake' to go...  Can't wait to go back and see our new friends..."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a good place for sushi. Not expensive abd courteous people. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Small hole the wall restaurant that seats approximately 40.  Not sure if we went on a bad night as the place smelled as if someone burnt some fish.  Either bad ventilation or mistake in the kitchen that could not be aired out.  One waitress on a Monday night and she was trying to handle 20 diners.  Had to ask for a menu, had to ask for the separate sushi menu, had to ask for more wasabi.  Not fresh wasabi as mentioned by some other diners - you would think you would get fresh wasabi if you order a $60 boat (16 slices of sashimi, 6 nigiri, and 3 chef's choice in rolls - need to be wrapped tighter) with 2 miso soups and 2 salads.  There were three of us, thus either comp the one additional soup and salad or at least mention to diners that it comes with two and ask if we wanted to purchase an additional soup and salad.  Do not just drop off and run off.  Suggest not getting the boat as the rolls were not innovative for a \"Chef's Choice\" and the sashimi and nigiri had three of the same fish.  Peruse through the menu and get the sashimi and rolls that interest you.  Fish was fresh and decent sized slices.  No Tobiko (Flying Fish) available on the menu - this is a Masago (Smelt) only restaurant for those who love the bigger Tobiko roe.  A four star if not for the burnt odor (we were not in a Korean BBQ restaurant) and lack of Tobiko on the menu."}
{"text":"All day happy hour you say? The happy hour itself didn't appeal to me much, so I settled with a bento to satisfy my hungry belly. Plus, prices seemed like typical normal sushi prices anyways.  I ordered the Bento that let's you pick a main entree, sushi roll or sashimi and a side. I went with the Beef Teriyaki, Mixed Tempura and Sashimi (Chef's Choice). The Beef Teriyaki was more like a Bulgogi with Teriyaki sauce so don't expect strips of beef, the sauce was also very sweet. The tempura had a thick batter, but came with shrimp, kabocha squash, onion and carrot. I didn't care too much for the tempura dipping sauce. The side salad had a white dressing, that didn't have a distinct flavor. The sashimi however, was very good and fresh. Since it was Chef's choice, I ended up with pieces of Salmon and Yellowtail, with an amazing Wasabi relish I could not stop eating even though I've cleared my sinuses through and through. The bento also comes with rice and miso soup- that was lukewarm.  Price is decent about $12 for a bento. The star of the bento was the sashimi, really fresh and delicious. The rest of the meal was lackluster. The establishment is a bit small so be prepared when it's dinner time. I'd definitely come back for probably just the sashimi next time however."}
{"text":"Went back to give it another try. Much better service this time and the sushi was excellent. Very small place - if you go during busy hours expect a wait. It's worth it though!"}
{"text":"Guys, you can not miss this place. From appearances, this place can look a little less impressive compared to many of the other sushi restaurants around the west side of Phoenix, but don't be fooled by appearances. I've lived in all corners of the Phoenix metro area, and I've eaten at my fair share of sushi restaurants, I can tell you this place is one of the best.  For people who love fish (as in sashimi, versus rolls with more cooked fish and rice and garnishes) this is the best spot. I am a fierce lover of Chirashi bowls, which is sashimi on top of sushi rice, and this place does it the best in the valley. It's fresh and beautiful, with a large variety of flavors and textures, and it's the most reasonably priced chirashi I've ever come across.  I go to this restaurant about two to three times a month, and typically get the house salad and the Chirashi. I'm so consistent at this point they pretty much know me when I walk in the door. The staff is friendly and welcoming. On most days, all customers will get a small sample of their sunomono salad, which is a nice little \"amuse-bouche\".   Their house salad is pretty plain but I love the creamy sesame dressing that they put on top. It's a nice change from the average carrot ginger dressing or soy and sesame one, both are too tart for my taste. Their Chirashi comes with a miso soup, as well as fresh wasabi if you ask for it. The bowl itself contains a large variety of fish. There's the typical salmon, tuna, yellowtail, as well as unagi, albacore, masago, spicy tartare, snapper, ebi, and crab. They're familiar flavors, so it's not too adventurous, but it's always delicious.  Other tasty appetizers include the baked green mussels (another personal favorite, though pricier) and the chicken karaage. The sushi rolls are pretty standard. I'm not a big fan of fancy rolls with an overabundance of garnish, so I can't speak for them. I will say that their happy hour (Monday-Saturday 3pm-6pm) is a great way to try their menu without racking up a big bill. Don't miss this affordable and delicious place!"}
{"text":"Tasty sushi, nice people, and large portions.   In a non-descript strip center, but food is delicioys.  Clean and welcome inside.  Stop in and say hi to Armida.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars as a restaurant, but there's only one down fall, it's warm inside!!! I'm not sure if it's just a temporary thing, but it's a small & was very hot.  As for the sushi, I only had the California roll because it was redeemed off the Yelp review. It wasn't too bad, I've had better. The other sushi orders that were coming out looked hella good though.  I had the fried rice, which was $5 btw, and it was sooooo good!!! Probably the best fried rice I've had around this area to be honest. I also ordered the ramen which was really delicious! It's a bit spicy, but so good.  This is really a hidden gem, good food for a great price.  Our waitress today was really nice & friendly.  I'll definitely eat the food again, but it'll be take out. ...I can't stand eating in a hot environment."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good but the music selection made me feel like I was in rave club. Will come back once the music selection becomes suitable."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews we went here today. we were interested in the fresh sashimi. The raves about the freshness made me want to go. We don't live on the west side. So we traveled there. Reviewers should talk about the ambience - first of all. It is more like a little diner. Tile floors. Tiny.  Stripmall. No ambience.  Take out - feel.  The greeting was nice. The food was really  good. They treated us very well.  They gave us the salad- the creamy cucumber imitation crab salad with sesame seeds. It was nice.  The service was fast. The owners were sweet.  We chose to get the $50 boat. It was really fresh and flavorful. The sushi chef made great selections. It was fair for the price.  We were treated to a free dessert.    What I don't see in all the other reviews is that the ambience is not a - \"restaurant\".  It's more like a quick take out joint. The food was great. But it's not a...restaurant.  It's a quick and go."}

{"text":"OMG, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  Okay - this is the best sushi I've had anywhere in Arizona. Their rolls are good, they have a decent amount of sushi in each, and the place is ridiculously clean. I LOVE LOVE LOVE everything here. The screaming O I think is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Never again will we come back! It's so hot in here that I'm sweating, the fish in our burrito was warm and it's usually loaded with fish but there wasn't much at all , our tempura roll was drowned in some sort of dark sauce, and even the Las Vegas (usually my favorite) was tasteless and the salmon was definitely not fresh... We didn't think it was going to be this bad! Well I now believe the popularity of the restaurant lies in the hands of the chef. Sad to see the previous two go. Only reason it is getting two because of the nice waitress."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. I go here with family and friends multiple times. I recommend the Philadelphia roll and Las Vegas roll. Not pricey and great flavor."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Sushi Catcher. Great sushi and a really good happy hour. A definite repeat. The albacore was like butter, the salmon was also good along with the varies other rolls we ordered."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! My boyfriend and I are regulars here. We keep coming back for the amazing sushi, fair prices, and fun atmosphere. Best sushi I've had in the valley. They recently hired a new server who has ruined our experience a bit, so now we prefer to sit at the bar to avoid her which is a bummer. Until then however, we have had no complaints."}
{"text":"Prices got raised. All day happy hour is no more. And my favorite chirashi bowl is now $14 :(. This place used to be good for the value. Now it's just like any other average sushi restaurant. Meh."}
{"text":"We go to this Mom and Pops suchi bar 2 or 3 times a month.  Food is always fresh and Ted the suchi chef is great.  Not much to look at here but the food is awesome and the prices are even better."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!   I have this really odd sea vegetable allergy...which makes no sense to me, so of course I would be one to love sushi, but can't have the seaweed... When I let the server know about my reaction to seaweed, she was very accommodating and they wrapped my sushi in soy paper! Music to my ears, and the sushi is wonderful. This is now our go to spot when we crave sushi. Great everything!"}
{"text":"This place is Delicious & Awesome! Fulfill's Sushi Cravings!!! Ordered the Yellow Tail prepared to Perfection. Albacore Delight is the Gem (:  Add Calamari which was Amazing. Service with a Smile & the Owner Making Sure Food, Style & Service Work to fulfill the Sushi Cravings Appetite(:"}
{"text":"awesome, delicious. sashimi that melts in your mouth! large portions and great prices! I wish I knew about this place sooner  great service too!"}
{"text":"Food: I love this little hole in the wall sushi place. The one thing that I like the most is the FRESH WASABI that they give you. It looks like Green wet ginger and its amazing with your sushi, not that pasty green glob of clay that most places gives you. For you no carbs eaters get the SUPERMAN burrito roll but ask them to make w/o rice. Sex on the beach Roll is spicy but amazing. I think if you spend over $50 they give you some Mochi ball ice cream for free but don't quote me....it's only happend a couple of times...maybe its becuz we are regulars. This place is a must try for any sushi lover.  Decor: it's fairly plain. Not much to say. Your not there for the ambiance. They have a TV is the most   Service: Good servers. Quick and efficient.  Overall: Love this place when I'm in the area. It's one of my go to places for Sushi."}
{"text":"So yummy! Fresh and delicious. I loved everything. The sashimi was great. We also had the spicy tuna and Tokyo roll. We were able to watch sports updates and enjoy our meal. Everything was well prepared and high quality. Very pleased and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Loved it all, great food, good prices. I no longer live in that area, but would be happy to visit again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Gave this a try and did not enjoy the food one bit. Upon entering I could smell a heavy stench of oil. I let that pass since the average yelp review was pretty high, maybe the food would be better. Ordered the Tuna Tataki which had a burnt taste to each piece. Also ordered the sushi platter and each piece of sushi was tough. Wanted to really like this place because it got great reviews. The staff was nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Sushi Catcher for a few months now after reading the many reviews. I was there last Friday night dining with friends.  There are few sushi places just within 3-5 miles.  This place might be hard to spot since the sign only says Sushi not the actual name.  It is a small place and located in a strip mall.    I am taking off a star due the extreme long wait on food.  Actually, my friends were starving by the time the rolls and kitchen prepared food items finally came.  They only have one sushi guy rolling sushi even on the weekend.  We had to wait about 45 minutes for food to arrive.  I had ordered the Vegas and Rainbow Roll.  These rolls were part of their all day happy hour menu.  Taste was nothing spectacular but not bad.  At the end, the owner did apologize for the long wait and gave us all a soy sauce bottle to take home, but was inexcusable for the long wait.  Hopefully, they would consider hiring more staff to help on the weekends."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food. Lately I have been doing everything \"Omikase\" (Chef's choice)..I really hate filling out forms anyway. :-)  All I can say is it has been especially wonderful, creative, delicious stuff.  It is like a Christmas present every time, and the absolutely awesome flavors and presentation, have not disappointed even a single time.    If you're coming with someone who just doesn't do sushi, the baked Salmon roll is the most delicious I have tried in all of Phoenix (and I always try it if it's on the menu at other places, to compare). They can enjoy a cooked fish that still comes in a roll like your sushi and you can enjoy your traditional sushi!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chirashi bowl and was very disappointed when it came out. It is one of the most expensive items on the menu and at most sushi restaurants the presentation on this dish usually blows people away, however the one here is very sad and stingy with portions. As you can see in the pic they only gave the tiniest amount of seaweed salad and no daikon. I also had bad stomach pains (which led to many bathroom visits if you know what I mean) the next few days afterwards. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"such a little place, one sushi chef, KC, he knows how to rock those sushi, took a long time for it to come out... Other than that, we are happy !"}
{"text":"It was amazing experience!! Food quality was great. Chef justin was very professinal, and friendly. All of all it was great experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The ramen was amazing and such a great price and happy hour all day is a plus. Will definitely be back for that and more rolls once I can eat sushi again!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi place in Phoenix and I found it. I had albacore sushi and the shrimp roll on happy hour. The albacore was really good quality. They are not overpriced or stingy with the fish like a lot of other places. I think I have found my sushi spot on the west side!"}
{"text":"The all day happy hour is what drew me in here initially. Though there are a few yummy items on the happy hour menu, it's their sashimi and bento boxes that I love.   Favorites on the HH menu include: Tootsie roll, Casey roll (must try), golden cali roll, shrimp tempura roll. Other favorites are the the Alaskan roll and bento box combo with beef teriyaki and sashimi, comes with rice and salad. Sashimi is always fresh and has 2 slices of salmon, tuna, and yellow tail.   She usually gives a complimentary cucumber is rice vinegar salad (acquired taste but I love it) or mochi at the end. Service is good considering they are so small and only have 3 people working at a time. The owner and his wife are super friendly and love what they do, it definitely shows in their quality and presentation of the food.   It is so hard to find good sashimi in this area. Compared to other local sushi joints, Sushi catcher gets their fish from a different vendor and I can honestly taste the difference. This place has replaced Yen as my go to sushi spot in the area! Finally, a good sushi place in Glendale!"}
{"text":"My wife really likes this place since there are a couple rolls that she loves. Overall, I think the food tastes fine and the service is pretty good but I wasn't thrilled when one of the menu items was \"Jap Lasagna.\""}
{"text":"This place offers excellent customer service, the owners are willing to work with you on substitutions at no additional charge. I am a regular here and what I can say is that this place has switched owners atleast 4x since 2010. The price is great for what they offer. I have tried their specialty rolls and they are just average. What stands out is the chirashi bowl for 11.95 all day price. If you like hot food please try the yellow tail collar (kama). It will not dissapoint."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, this might not be a 100% fair review as I did not get sushi here, BUT I say if they serve an item, it should be legit. I went here with a couple friends on lunch from work (I happened to be working in Glendale, not my usual). Everyone raved about this place and it got great reviews, so I was excited. Anyway, I got the chicken teriyaki bento. It was well priced at about 8$ and coming with the chicken, rice, salad, and soup. The problem was it just all wasn't anything special. The chicken reminded me of those refrigerated pre sliced pieces of chicken....like it was cut too perfectly to have been cut by a human....not sure about that. The sauce was typical, but there wasn't a lot of it. The salad dressing was ok, kind of like an asian ranch I guess, but I always hope for the orange ginger dressing. The soup was typical miso. It just wasn't anything special, it was fine, but I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here."}
{"text":"After a week long of craving sushi I FINALLY got my fix on at this place! =)  I absolutely loveeeee Sushi and love trying new places...We found this place on Yelp  (obviously...  =P) and what caught my attention was that they have happy hour all day everyday! Oh I'm there!   We ordered so many amazing rolls and everything came out on  this cute little boat. We got the Philly roll, Rainbow roll, Salmon Roll, this salmon garlic roll and much more...Everything was so delicious and fresh! For their happy hour menu they have a variety of rolls that range from $3-7. Also, they have their house wine which is not bad, for $5, Sake Bombs for $5 and small Hot Sake for $3.   Everything was sooooo yummy and you really can't beat happy hour all day everyday. Not to mention the customer service was great! Everyone was extremely friendly and funny and we even got some ice cream from them at the end. =) & of course all of the great food places are on the opposite side of town from me. I will DEFINITELY be back to get my sushi fix on though! =)"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!! We tried 4 different rolls, loved them all but especially the Philly rolls! We also got the pot stickers which were crispy and good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"we really enjoyed the sushi at this little place..we had \"the boat\" and it was really good"}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome and service was exceptional!  We had the Casey roll, yellow tail, garlic room and shrimp tempura (based on other Yelpsters recommendations) and everything from the presentation to the flavor was amazing! They brought fresh ground wasabi for our sushi and cucumber salad to try in between our miso soup and sushi.  Our server Katrina was really attentive and the experience as a whole was phenomenal! Our new favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a better rating because it's so close to school and I honestly didn't find anything wrong with the experience but it really just came down to the fact that the sushi wasn't as good as other places for a comparable price, even around this area, and the price wasn't a bargain in any way.  Ultimately, there really was just nothing that set this place apart from other sushi places around the area. I'd come here in a quick pinch if I was really craving sushi, but Tokyo Lobby nearby honestly had slightly better quality fish, the happy hour menu will bring some items to way cheaper than at Sushi Catcher, and they have more non-sushi items if you are into more of teriyaki, soba, or other Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty much the same as other places nothing really outstanding. Unfortunately the tiger roll was really lacking; a better place for them would be Atami. Also the price on the website for the specialty rolls was not the correct price, once we actually paid the tiger roll priced at five something online was actually nine something."}
{"text":"I'm very sorry to say Sushi Catcher has again changed owners. I've given this new staff a couple of chances and things went from bad to worse. ordered 3 rolls and when they came out one was the wrong one. I mentioned that I had ordered something different. The reply was interesting to say the least.  \"You don't want\" I remarked that I wasn't looking to get \"something for nothing\" and that he would not need to remake the roll.. This guy then stops making Sushi and goes and checks the ticket and charges me for the more expensive roll...  the extra $2-3 bucks is not that big of a deal. The lack of quality for the food was. The rice is of a much cheaper quality. It is also now very overcooked and mushy. He is not stingy with it thou. the ratio of rice to fish for the rolls has gone thru the roof. the portion of fish has gone down and the portion of rice has gone up. in fact the simple and small Salmon roll that used to be so delicious is now a pinwheel. a quick recap fish portions are now much smaller     the crab mix for the California rolls has changed the rice is now of a lower quality and is over cooked the Nori is no longer very fresh.. it is chewy and not crisp as it should be the skill set at the Sushi knife has dropped remarkably. .. I don't care how inexpensive it gets..  I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Best sushi! Love them !!! Always great service even when they are super busy ! Always fresh and different rolls to try from !"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and it is the best sushi in town. You can't beat the prices or the quality. My favorite roll is the Philadelphia. The service is great and they have a family mom and pop feel. I love it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  The crew decided to try a new sushi spot tonight.  After looking around Yelp, we decided to stop here since we intended to go grab boba afterwards at a nearby place.  After bracing ourselves for a strip mall sushi joint, we walked in and our dinner adventure begins.  It's a small cozy restaurant with a few modest tables and some seating at the sushi bar.  It's sparsely decorate with the personality of a goldfish.  Oh well.  We're here for the food anyways.  From what I could tell, there was one sushi chef making the rolls, two waitresses, and perhaps someone else in the back area prepping stuff.  We were told to sit anywhere we want and the most unenthusiastic waitress [we'll call her \"unhappy child\"] and her trainee served us.  Do you ever get that feeling that your server just doesn't care about her job?  Yeah, that's totally the vibe her.  The trainee was super friendly though and seemed more than willing to answer any questions and refill our waters and tea.  10-minutes of decision making later, we decided to order a sushi boat set and some Happy Hour rolls on the side.  Set A for $35 comes with nine pieces of sashimi, five pieces sushi, and two \"special rolls.\"  When asked what the special rolls were, the unhappy child just shrugged and told us, \"whatever the chef wants to make.\"  Oookaaay...  I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure there's actual names for the rolls but she was just too lazy to ask.  Whatever.  After eating a small cucumber salad with imitation crab and too much dressing, the rolls all came out and shortly after, the boat!  I was starting to get excited again, after the unhappy child dampened the mood, upon seeing thick cuts of sashimi and our rolls.  I decided that after eating some HH salmon rolls and a few avocado rolls, I wanted my first bite from the boat to be some salmon sashimi.  I love salmon.  They were so generously thickly cut but it wasn't fresh.  No cantaloupe smell but still smooth.  It was kind of a let down and the rolls were unevenly cut!  Everything else was pretty much the same:  big portion and/or cuts, not the best quality.  I do like how they offer fresh wasabi.  $20ea. before tip for the three of us for a $35 sushi boat and four Happy Hour rolls.  Cheap on the wallet AND on the quality.  One pro is, if you want to eat on a budget, Happy Hour is all day, every day, and runs between $3-7 [if you think about it, that just means they have really cheaply priced rolls and there's no real specials here].  Not the best sushi in the west valley but okay prices for okay food."}
{"text":"Thank you for this one, Yelp! All you will see outside is a nondescript sign from the road that says \"Sushi\". Something that generic seems like the kind of place that you would want to avoid. Thankfully, Yelp to the rescue.  I found this place while looking for ideas for my wife's birthday. 4.5 stars, in Glendale, prices seem reasonable. Let's try it! Great call.  The portions are standard. Expect 8 pieces when you order your maki rolls.  Happy hour is all day. Want to scratch the sushi itch without dropping too much money. There are plenty of good rolls for $3-5. We went very hungry and planning to sample plenty. We ordered 6 orders of sushi (2 were not from happy hour specials) and a large sake and it came to $58 after tax/tip.  The atmosphere was perfect if you want a more casual environment for sushi. If you are awful at using those wooden instruments of torture (like me), sushi is finger food. It seems strange to feel like you should be dressed up to order food that you may eat with your fingers. The music was quiet enough to easily carry on a conversation and was not the stereotypical Japanese background music you'd expect to hear at many restaurants. My preferences are more classic rock/metal but at least it didn't feel like they were trying too hard with the music.  The staff was attentive, friendly, and not pushy. They greeted us at the door and offered us a seat immediately. Our waters were never empty. I asked to have the sake come with our first order and they waited. I've heard that they will bring fresh wasabi if you ask (we didn't think to) but they did at least let us exchange our low sodium soy sauce for the real stuff (if I'm going to have soy, I'll have the real stuff!).  Our orders:  Las Vegas Roll. Fried. Tasted good. Not too much cream cheese. Rainbow roll. Nice size cuts of fish on these. Spicy tuna roll. Strangely enough this was my least favorite (normally they are my favorite \"basic\" maki rolls and the ones I make when I'm doing homemade). The tuna was a touch cold (I realize that expecting fresh/never frozen fish is unreasonable in the valley but that really did feel like it needed a bit more time to come to room temperature). And I would've liked a tad more heat. Spicy garlic and salmon rolls. More of these please. I can't remember the name but the spicy scallop rolls (not happy hour special but they were $6.95). Again, more please. And casey roll. This was my personal favorite.  The spicy ones were a touch spicy to my wife who is a bit sensitive to heat but edible. The sauce that the casey rolls came with was good enough that I started dipping my other makis in that.  At the end they brought us the mochi ice cream (we were debating it but deciding to save that for our next trip). It was a nice touch. Have us leaving on a great note and after trying it, we KNOW we will order it again next time.  The fish didn't smell at all fishy. The food stacks up well against any other sushi I've had in the valley (and generally at a cheaper price as long as you stick to happy hour specials). The restaurant was very clean. And I watched the chef wash his hands numerous times. Obviously a clean kitchen and work environment is important to him. This may not be the absolute best sushi I've ever had. But it was darned good and the price was right. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The wife and decided to check this place out after reading some reviews. I think it's funny that it has many positive reviews yet the place seems hardly noticeable. The prices were fair, the food was great, and the service was even better."}
{"text":"Pros: Quick service. Cheaply priced, but good tasting, good looking sushi. Cons: Forgot the edamame. Felt rushed when the waitress forgot we ordered entrees and she offered a dessert menu. Was mainly interested in trying their Shoyu Ramen. Delicious noodles, but the broth wasn't the most flavorful.  I do feel bad that she was the only waitress for a full house of customers. :(  Recommend? Sure, but for a quick, cheap, but alright sushi lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I was so surprised and impressed with Sushi Catcher!  The food was incredible.  You have to try the Catcher Roll if you like spicy and creative rolls.  Very friendly and excellent happy hour, even on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. I'm a huge fan of Harumi and it's hard to find anything that compares but this place isn't bad. The prices are good and they give generous portions. The spicy tuna was actually spicy, which I liked ! The avocado roll was so so. I've been here a few times and I'll keep coming back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"We found this cozy place on Yelp.  Don't let the strip mall environs have you misjudge this place. Excellent salmon sashimi. the bento box was terrific with a great price point.  We had never had snapper sashimi and did not like the taste so they switched it free of charge for more salmon! The sunomono salad (cucumber & crab mix) was phenomenal! Friendly service, all in all great sushi experience which is usually very hard for this Philadelphia transplant to find here in the desert!!"}
{"text":"Hit up Sushi Catcher the other day and I was very impressed.  It's in a rather unassuming strip mall and the inside of the restaurant is kind of bland yet sterile but don't let that fool you.  The sushi was great and so were the prices.  I was lucky to be there during happy hour and the most expensive roll I got was the Casey roll which was pretty delicious.  The Las Vegas roll was excellent as well.  I got a Sake Bomb for $5 and was very happy with the service.  I only wish I had brought a bunch more people with me to enjoy.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but the last time I was there the sushi was not fresh. Salmon tasted yucky. I think the standard is going down."}
{"text":"Not only is Sushi Catcher a \"Whole-In-The-Wall\" as my friend Ashley S. points out, it truly is a hidden gem in an unassuming plaza on Bell Road and 63rd Avenue.  But I wonder if she meant \"Hole-in-the-Wall.\" Oh well, it's nor here nor there.  We get it. :-D  As you venture into this abyss they call parking lot surrounded by businesses that often times look like a ghost town and questions yourself \"what am I doing here?\"  Once you are passed that point, you make it to their pitched black door of wondering if you went to the right place.  The last hurdle is opening the door and low and behold, a little sushi joint with little tables and a small-ish sushi counter towards the back.  At this point, you are relieved and it's chow time.  Once seated, you are confronted with a fairly basic menu of various things but in addition to that, there is a hand written paper menu plastered next to you by the wall.  This \"wall menu\" contains more specialized items such as tonkotsu ramen and other sushi creations.    Skipping right to my favorite things I typically order here: Tonkotsu Ramen and the Nigiri's.  For a \"Hole-in-the-Wall\" they really make it up in the quality of their food.  Their ramen I personally love.  Its as good as one can get in the state of Arizona without having to travel to SoCal where it's Ramen mecca out there.  The broth, the noodles, the porky meat, and toppings are exactly what I would expect out of a traditional/standard ramen.  The flavors and textures all gelled together harmoniously.    The Nigiri Sushi is always fresh, especially during dinner time.  I personally like the Salmon Nigiri.  It's fresh tasting and not rubbery at all.  It goes down super smooth.    The vibe here is very humbling and gets down to business which is to satisfy your Japanese hunger.  The staff is always friendly and its a place I hope last for eternity.  The pricing is very wallet friendly especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp for a sushi place close to my house. Sushi Catcher had some very good reviews. Headed over but when I got there I discovered they are close on Monday.  I went back on Thursday. (Today)  Decor? Nice neat, looked to be very clean. The usual as most I have visited. Sushi Bar where you could watch the Sushi Chef (probably the wrong terminology). I am not by any way a sushi expert. Different beers and saki advertisements on the wall.  I have never sit at the bar, so when it was suggested by my waitress I thought, Why not. What an education. The Sushi Chef, KC, Artist was never still. I was there for about half hour to maybe a little longer. I watched him make roll after roll. Plus many other dishes.  My waitress was very nice and tried to be helpful. But with my limited knowledge of sushi and her limited english we had to talk for a while for me to choose. My choice was a Rainbow roll and 2 pieces of tuna and 2 of salmon. And I got to watch my meal being sculpted. Quite a bit of education. You should do this some day if you have not already. Go see KC.  History for me. The friends I have been eating sushi with put a lot of wasabi and soy sauce. I do like the wasabi, but it does mask the taste of your meal.  As I watched KC i noticed he took a lot of pain to make sure everything was done just right. I noticed when he made the sushi he would put a little wasabi on the rice before he put on the meat. This time i thought I would eat my sushi without any additional wasabi or soy sauce. This was a very good choice on my part. By doing this I was able to really get the taste of the sushi. I did try putting a little wasabi and soy sauce of a couple of like pieces. I preferred the pieces without the additional wasabi. Other observations is his pieces of sushi were thicker than most places I have been. OH, and after the meal I asked the waitress what i should have to finish off this fine meal. She suggested Mochi Ice Cream.  Two balls of ice cream wrapped in a soft dough. These had been cut in 2 pieces. Yes this did finish a fine meal right. I will continue to go to other sushi restaurants but I will make many trips back to this place. To date this is by far the best I have had. Do try them."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in a strip mall that at night the sign says \"Sushi\".  Arrived here on a Friday Night around 9:15 pm and the place was packed and they close at 10:00 pm.  There was one table left for the 3 of us. The restaurant only has 8 tables and about 6 seats at the sushi bar.   I liked the all day happy hour which has $5 sushi selections. The service was very good and Ted the Sushi Chef came to our table to make sure we were taken care of.  We each ordered a Bento Box and then some sushi. The Salmon Bento Box with Gyozas was a winner! Salmon was generous and tendor with a perfect amount of teriyaki sauce. The Gyozas were probably the best I have had and definitely home made that were deep fried perfectly.   As for the sushi, we shared the Golden California Roll which was very good, but the pinnacle was the Volcano Roll which was perhaps the best sushi roll I have ever had. It is shrimp and lobster over California Roll served hot. If there is one sushi dish to get here, this is it. I was so full when it came I could barely eat it but it is generous in shrimp and lobster,  it could be a meal in its self.  What a pleasant surprise and the food is top notch.  I live in Scottsdale and this restaurant is pretty far away but will definitely be back again.   Thank you Sushi Catcher it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!!  Fresh and delicious sushi and excellent non-sushi items as well!  Happy hour all the time, so the prices are very reasonable and service is superb."}
