{"text":"This place is weird, a diner with Greek food. But the chicken pita I had was very good and priced well. My husband loves the gyro. Staff is helpful and nice. All that it is missing is updated restrooms. please!!"}
{"text":"Very  friendly service and suprisingly good food.  We had the gyro and thought it was as good as anywhere else.  For getting there 5 min before closing the food was fresh and not old tasting.  Only issue was no green salad stuff on the wrap.  I would definately eat here again."}
{"text":"A little bit of everything in decent quantity for a good price. Many people must consider this place a bargain since most of clients come to pickup their takeouts.
I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad."}
{"text":"If you're Greek this probably won't compare to your mama's but I'm not and was pleasantly delighted by Showmar's. Recommended by a colleague  in CLT and within walking distance to hotel. Busy place at 6p and large menu. Ordered souvlaki dinner that is a lot of food. Pork was flavorful  and tender, salad was fresh and crisp. Staff was helpful and courteous, stopping by table to check on food and drink refill,  step way above fast food.  Solid choice."}
{"text":"Fast, Friendly,  and Good Food. Stopped after a long day on the road. Parking lot had a crowd so I try it. If you order the Gyro dinner you better be hungry.  Definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I think one has to be local to really enjoy Shomars.  The food is marginal, and the menu is about 80% sandwiches.  Most meals can be bought for $7-$10 with drink.

Better than McDonalds.  Kind of like a '50's-style diner, without the ambiance."}
{"text":"This showmars have the best lemon pepper chicken in the CTL area really love this place"}
{"text":"The food was so good, the staff was very attentive and their prices we awesome!! Its close to the airport so they have it going on with amazing customer service. They also have milkshakes and greek desserts that taste so good"}
{"text":"I can not explain how amazing this place is! I love everything from the desserts to the food!! The staff is awsome too! Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is the first and only Showmars I've visited. There are about 20 of them in the Charlotte area. Food was pretty good. I'd give it one half step-up from a burger at a fast food joint.

I had a Greek Salad; the salad (especially the chicken) was tasty but the dressing was \"totally bleh\". Thankfully the default dressing was on the side so I asked for blue cheese dressing and it was much better -- they had Ken's dressing in a package.

My dinner mates had a burger and fish and chips. All around \"OK\". I'd not go out of my way to go again and certainly not worth a quest..."}
{"text":"Great chicken pita, but I would have to give the hot fudge Sunday the best in Charlotte award!! Mmmmmm good!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect, I have passed this one up numerous times. This place is almost like a hybrid fast food/ diner restaurant. 

The service I experienced on a Sunday night was fast and friendly. The food was decent, I had the chicken fried steak which to this day I'm really not sure how it got that name but it was tasty and probably very unhealthy. The sides of Mac and cheese and collard greens turned this into a proper Suedo- southern home cooked meal all for around $10 range including my sugary beverage. I'd certainly come back here over Miguel's!"}
{"text":"For a traveler, this is a delicious meal plus Pesi cola. I really like it. They have pretty good sauces with fried fish, shrimps and fries. But, please don't complain about a little fried oil on the plate because it's the fried dishes order."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have changed my whole opinion about this restaurant; if you go there after \"normal\" lunch hours, it is very slow and service is lacking.  I used to really like this particular Showmars, but today was an attitude and game changer for me.  I stopped in for a late lunch (around 4:15PM on Tuesday) and saw one waitress and one clerk behind the counter who appeared to be new since he had to ask the waitress several questions. When it was FINALLY my turn, I asked for an old fashioned burger combo - with collard greens as my side. I paid, and as an afterthought, asked if I could get extra pickles on the old fashioned burger. I was shocked when he told me it was an additional 50 cents. I explained that I only wanted 2-3 pickles on it - not a whole plate!  He was nice, considering, and explained that he was only doing what the supervisor had told him.  At that point, I was just put-out by this and asked for my money back. Obviously I left, and don't know if or when I will ever return!  Incidentally, an older man behind me in line commented that it sure was taking a long time in there today. What really gets me is this: do they deduct any money when people ask for \"no pickles\" on their sandwich???  It's the little things........."}
{"text":"Sorry Showmars.  I remember I used to visit occasionally long time ago as my neighbor like your place.  I stopped by to pick up some dinner after I landed at airport. I chose your fried steak with green and salad to go.  Sound healthy, right ?
Besides salad, I almost have to throw the rest away.  The fried steak was actually 2 pieces of heavy breaded minced meat (wondering if they were beef) with gravy, hardly feel there was meat.  the green was way over cooked like yellowish, mushy vegetables with heavy salt and oil that triggered my blood pressure.
Not to mention the price was about $8.  After four hours, my taste bud still feel that salt and oil in my throat.  I guess next time, I rather have a bad-rep MacDonald burger for a couple of dollar instead."}
{"text":"So... Showmar's...

We were visiting in Charlotte for a small convention over the weekend, and the first night there after driving several hundred miles throughout the day we were not really ready for anything heavy or insane... just a bite that would be good sitting in the hotel room. I did a search of places that were close to the hotel, and Showmar's popped up as a good candidate.

We headed over and got in... apparently just in time because once my order was ready I had to be let out the door because they were closed. I hadn't even realized when I entered that it was close to closing time... it hadn't seemed all that late out, but I guess with the sun going down so late in the evening (damn you Daylight Savings!) that kind of sense gets really thrown out of whack.

Anyway... got the gyros back to the hotel (that is all we ordered) and they were decent. Not the best I have had, but the sauce being kept on the side was a very nice touch. All in all a decent place to eat, and I would go back."}
{"text":"Not bad, stopped by on my way to airport. Got the gyro dinner. Lot of meat, needed more I put onions and feta from my salad on the gyro. If it wasn't for me doing that it really would have been way too dry to eat. Service was good."}
{"text":"Visited the Little Rock location, which I rarely do because it's closer but Freedom Dr has the luxury of the drive up when placing your order ahead ...so that's where I generally go. Anyway, walked in, there was no greeting. The cashiers were occupied so I understood. Then there was a young man at the far register who took my request. I advised that I had a call in Order for Hudson and then we were greeted by a very well mannered and professional young man by the name Darius. He spoke made light conversation while we waited and the other cashier was getting our order together. Rarely is customer service found in restaurants and fast foods these days so when I experience it, I find the time to share it. I received my Wow moment at this location yesterday. I left pleased to have spent my money and the food was great as usual of course. Thanks Darius for your outstanding customer service and hope that you keep that up. It will take you far."}
{"text":"Read the reviews--good and bad. Decided to give it a try. 
WOW!  Salt and Pepper Flounder, perfect. 
Shrimp.  Perfect. 
Wait staff. Very friendly. 
Recommend"}
{"text":"The food is awesome the service not so great.  The Greek salads with pita and grilled chicken are above par as is the gyros.  Great baklava too."}
{"text":"The menu covers many bases, from some Greek, to fried seafood, to sandwiches. Ordered a Greek salad with gyro meat. It was served in  taco shell type bowl, which I had never seen before. The salad was enjoyable, and it was plenty of food for a full meal. This is an unusual place, I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Not a total sit down restaurant, not fast food either. Order at the counter, and have the amazingly friendly staff bring it to your table.

For some Greek-American food it's not bad. By no means fancy, but it tastes pretty good. I would say it's a step above a burger joint, for some simple,  inexpensive food, come here and enjoy."}
{"text":"The Flounder  sandwich and onion rings  at this place will set you free ! Good fresh cooked food..fast , and very reasonable ...even cheap ! I Love it, and go there whenever I'm in Charlotte airport area ! Stays busy, but no wonder ! Try it you'll like it !"}
{"text":"Close to the airport, the Hampton and holiday inn (by car), this is a great lunch place. It's also one of the few restaurants in the area.
Ordering at the counter was fast and efficient. You pay; they give you a number which you place in the table and a server delivers your food. It took maybe five minutes and they were busy,busy.

Gyro salad was good. Huge served in a taco shell. And sodas germs free refills. Several people came by to make we didn't need anything else.

Would definitely come back. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, people were nice, and the waiting time was short. I had a flounder platter with a milkshake. Oh yes."}
{"text":"Good quick food close to airport.  Priced well and courteous staff.   Another customer was asking for a manager to compliment them on the cleanliness of the place.  I would agree.  Coming off a lunch rush the place was very clean."}
{"text":"We were looking for something quick and easy. They had plenty of helpers so no wait. I ordered the gyro and it was actually good, the meat wasn't dried out and gave plenty of it.  My son has the cheeseburger, he ate it all, so must of been good enough for him"}
{"text":"Best fish sandwich ever. Great hand battered onion rings and okra. None of that frozen crap."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, quick service, decent prices. Every time I eat here it is always consistent and no complaints whatsoever! They give you plenty of food for the price too."}
{"text":"First, they got my order totally wrong.  Very slow night only 4 people there.
Then when They arrived with my order, again wrong.  They substituted pinto beans for french fries.  The waitress actual asked me if I was ok with pinto beans or did she need to exchange for fries.  Duh!

Worst of all the food sucked. All except the fries which were just ok.  Then i had to get up and get ketchup my waitress said, Oh did you want ketchup?  It's a slow night so I took them off the table.  I said What?  You are open for another 4 hours.

It gets worse but will leave this review as is.

Avoid this location"}
{"text":"This place is must stop every time I travel back over to the east coast! Everything is good and the service is great. Freshly made food to order and friendly service and staff!! 
I always order the famous gyro and fish platters...

Definitely would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here because I was staying by the airport, and I ordered the gyro dinner. The pita was piled high with meat, and the salad and fries were a good accompaniment. The prices are good and the wait was short. I recommend it, especially if you're staying near CLT and want some Greek food."}
{"text":"All of the stars! I ordered some silly sounding thing like a Chicken Fiesta or some such and it was literally the best chicken something I have had in ages. It also had bell peppers and onions which were cooked to perfection. My husband got a gyro thing and that was good too. We got the kid a burger which she didn't eat so I don't know about their burgers. The fries were super good and had a french fry seasoning on them. They were directly across from the hotel we were staying in which was the main reason we went but if I was ever in the area of a Showmars again I would eat there!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Showmars, have been for years, but this particular location is not good! We were overcharged for a kids meal, when we complained, we were lied to and problem was not fixed. We will not be back to this location. Management/owners were rude and not appreciative of customers at all."}
{"text":"I had the country fried steak with brown gravy, roasted potatoes, and mac & cheese. The meat, gravy, and potatoes were so salty they tasted like they were being cured. I couldn't finish it. The mac and cheese was okay, but oddly a bit bland. I like their sandwiches and salads, but I don't think I will be ordering an entree again."}
{"text":"Did a park and fly on our way to Alaska out of Charlotte. This was a quick hop away from our hotel. So-so menu. Adequate food...nothing fancy. Large portions. Quick service. Clean. Friendly. A safe place  a good meal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, very nice attentive staff, clean and above all good food. I had a gyro and is possibly the best I've had."}
{"text":"Nearly a Charlotte institution, this is some of the best \"fast food\" around.  

George Cushell, the owner of Showmars has been a fixture in the Charlotte restaurant scene for longer than most Yelp readers have been alive.  He has gotten the concept of good food fast right with the Showmars chain.  This is not fine dining, or anything near it, but, it is good, food, served hot and fast with a smile at a reasonable price.

My faves are the original pita burger, all the seafood plates, the fish sandwich and the onion rings.  The baklava is as good as my own homemade version.  All the fried offerings are cooked to perfection and come to the table too hot to eat.  

I also like the Greek dishes and the Gyro, tenderloin tips and the souvlaki somoras are as good as any I have had anywhere.

These restaurants seem to be everywhere and I assume they are all about the same, but the Little Rock location is my \"go to\" location for fast, hot, fried fish, burgers or Greek treats.  I can't see that changing anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 4 star rating, but it's a fast food joint. Ordered the Gyro combo. It's tasty and satisfying. Service was good."}
