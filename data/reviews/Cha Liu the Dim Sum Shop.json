{"text":"Overall, this little uptown dim sum shop is good.  Food comes out hot and they have a great variety of dumplings and other authentic dim sum choices like the egg tarts."}
{"text":"No msg here! Yeah!  Served fresh, hot, not too salty or over cooked.  And not bathed in oil either. Most dumplings are prepared with delicate thin semi transparent dough which I so much prefer over the heavy& clumsy  hit you over the head wheat dough traditional southern china preparation.  Over forty types of dumplings. The ones in my images were the more flavorful of the lot.  Comparative quality to what I had in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.  Moderately expensive with good service And quaint decor. Unfortunately, The poorly designed stairs provide a treacherous climb to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unless you've got no other choice, I wouldn't recommend this place for Dim Sum.   Their food was comparable to the stuff you buy frozen from the grocery store and heat up at home, in rather small portions as well.  They brought our rice rolls with maybe a teaspoon of the accompanying soy sauce, we had to ask for more. (at proper dim sum places they'd give you maybe 4-5 times that amount)   Like other reviewers mentioned, it's overpriced as well, with each dish costing at least $3.50-$4.00. Dim sum for two ended up costing $38 after tax and tip.   Their decor is modern, a noticeable contrast to any traditional dim sum place I've been to. I noticed they didn't even have bowls or spoons on the tables, just a plate and chopsticks. (Try eating rice from a plate!)   I've been to many dim sum places downtown, midtown, and in Markham/Richmond Hill. Of course it's not fair to compare this place to them, but it reinforces my original message that if you are willing to venture anywhere else I'd suggest it. This place is barely decent and I'd only go back if I had no other option."}
{"text":"Upon first glance with all of its food critic awards on the window, Cha Liu seemed like a good choice. The decor was nice, as was the server...  ..Though once the food arrived it was apparent how overpriced it was for dim sum. Authentic \"hole in the wall\" dim sum places in Scarborough and the GTA tend to give much better value. The food itself was mediocre. The fried taro and pork balls were tasty, but small. The chicken and mushroom rice was a tiny portion that came with two heads of baby bok choy and a few slices of mushroom. The chicken tasted like it was turning and was clearly low-grade.  And when it came time to pay, my payment method was visa. The bill came up to $9.06 and the manager insisted that it had to be brought up to at least $10 for credit purchases. I offered to match him and add it to meet the minimum. He finally agreed with uncalled-for attitude. I let him know that the value was poor for portion sizes and he immediately returned my card, raising his voice. He told me to \"get out\" and I did so (with pleasure) after trying to offer my card once more.  It was overall the WORST dim sum dining experience I've ever had. My chinese family has been going for over a decade and we have never experienced such terrible management. If the food was at least decent it would be a redeeming factor.  Guess it's not a coincidence that the location is closing down in July."}
{"text":"The long stairway to get up to this second floor restaurant, this little dim sum joint is a great option for city folks to get good dim sum.  The best, most authentic dim sum restaurants are uptown in the Markham, Richmond Hill, Scarborough region.  It's hard to find any dim sum place south of Sheppard, at least one worth going to.  The menu is pretty good. There's a lot of \"popular\" mainstream dim sum dishes, like Har Gow, Siu Mei, BBQ pork buns etc .  Like I mentioned, if you really want the authentic stuff, go to Markham!! Pricewise, it's pretty pricey, I'm not going to lie, the majority of dishes smaller dim sum being above $3.50, bigger ones being even more.  The food is pretty good, very light and nicely prepared.    Worth a try, even if that's all you go for!"}
{"text":"Lots of attention is made to this dim sum place's table settings. The table, plates, tea pots, it's all the kind of geared to wow white uptown women who want to nosh on something that's not Eggs Benedict.   Service is excellent. There's an excellent English menu. Dishes are brought out in order and on time.  It's small, quiet, and romantic. If you're a woman looking for a place to take your woman crush/pilates buddy, this might do you.  But. Hmmm. The food. Hmmm. Portions are small. The CUTE! Chinese Girl seems to think the chicken's feet were too salty. I enjoyed the bbq pork fried rice but would have liked more than a finger bowl of it. End of the day, I'll give up decor for portion size and flavor."}
{"text":"This is a trap for most non Asian people or tourist. You get dim sum at prices that no Chinese people would think you're crazy. The food is not good. I don't understand why anyone would even try. DO NOT even try. If you drive 15 min., you'll get dim sum more than 1/10 of the the cost. You go up this long flight of stairs to get to the restaurant. I think they are charging you for the view of Eglinton and Yonge. What a joke!   Food was just bad!"}
{"text":"Anemic dumplings-- 1/2 the serving size, 2 x the cost, and 10% of the flavor of what you would find anywhere in Markham or at the fabulous dim sum place on Mt. Pleasant. Plus, the management seems to cater to pseudo-yuppies who don't head outside Yonge & Eg all that much, so the snooty service is no surprise.   They are intolerantly gluten ignorant. Poor selection of crystal rolls and rice based steamed dumplings.   That said, it is dim sum and dim sum is one of life's pleasures. Plus it's not crazy authentic chicken-foot-sucking cacaphonous-- it's preppy, delicate  dim sum that won't offend.  If you are REALLY craving dim sum and are quality agnostic, you could probably get your fix here."}
