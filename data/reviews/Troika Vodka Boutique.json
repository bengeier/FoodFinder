{"text":"I wandered into Troika Vodka Boutique last weekend. We had dinner at Beerbistro on King St and wanted to move our drinking to a different venue. We were looking for someplace low key with decent music and more of a lounge than club feel. We initially headed towards Pravda, but quickly walked past it after seeing the long line to get in.

Our next stop was Switch, which looked like an interesting resto-lounge. Unfortunately, the $20 cover was too steep and we weren't on the guest list. Apparently they have \"circus acts\" occasionally, so it sounds like a cool place to check out eventually. We saw flashing strobe lights across the street and like moths to a flame we discovered Troika.

My first impression of Troika was \"wow.\" The place has an understated outer appearance, but that quickly changes as soon as you walk through the doors. A doorman greets you and you immediately notice the elegant entranceway. It's brightly lit with crystal chandeliers, mirrors and bright white furnishings. Very classy. 

However, the bright lights end here and the entrance opens up to the dimly lit bar/lounge. This area contrasts starkly with the entranceway, but is equally pleasing aesthetically. The numerous chandeliers, luxurious furniture, blue recessed lighting and beautiful granite counter top bar all help with this. 

Despite being a physically seductive and intimate atmosphere, Troika does suffer from a lack of physical space. More specifically, the bar/lounge is very narrow. This is compounded by the addition of sofa seating opposite to the bar. As more people trickled into the bar, the hostess had to remove bar stools in order to free up space. Luckily, it was not too crowded that night, but I can see how it would a nuisance on a busier night. 

The bar staff was friendly and attractive. The service and crowd were unpretentious. Despite Troika's upscale appearance,  everyone was pretty down-to-earth. We even met one of the owners, Dimity, who took his time to explain the food items on the menu and even took us back to the kitchen to show us his food preparation. Service with a smile.

The music was good. They played mostly electronic and dance music that Saturday night. There was also promise of a live saxophonist, but we left before he got started. The drinks were okay. $8 for spirits and around $12 for their signature mixed drinks. Good vodka selection, but pretty basic liquor list and also a limited beer selection. 

Overall a good spot to grab a drink with friends and listen to music. It doesn't seem to get too crowded which is a plus in my book. It serves as a good alternative to Pravda and other busier venues. With the limited space, it's not a great place to dance. There is also limited seating to just sit and lounge. I think it's a good place to start, before moving to a busier venue. It is also a good spot if you simply wanted a low key night. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hidden away on King just East of the King Edward Hotel lies a sophisticated Vodka Boutique/Bar that was a elegant and just pretentious enough to make you feel like a somebody. Ha!

I was torn as to whether to give this place a 3 or a 4 star. But for the purposes of this review know that I am awarding it a 3.5 with a a note stating that depending on your lot in life you may award them higher or lower. I encourage you to give it a try. 

Aesthetically it is gorgeous. Being a Vodka bar the bar is the centerpiece of the entire venue with multiple varieties of vodka stocked to the ceiling. What I found impressive is that they had multiple bottles of each variety sitting in ice and snow behind the bar so that all their vodkas are served properly chilled. The bar is also backlit by blue lights and mirrors so it really is a site to behold. 

The decor extends from the bar with antique looking wing back chairs and couches and gorgeous chandeliers hung in rows above. This place is certainly posh. 

Staff is also super attractive (kudos)!

Down sides would be that aside from vodka this place falls kinda flat. I asked for an old fashioned and it was made with Canadian Club and way too much sugar. I mean how do you not have bourbon at a bar this nice. 

Only beer on tap is hogtown which was easy enough to drink but at a whopping $10.25 for a pint I felt like I was getting screwed Rogers Centre/MLSE style. I guess that decor comes at a price. 

My thoughts: good place to take a date fellas. Dimly lit, swanky, higher class. Take your lady here for a drink or two before or after dinner and you'll look like a pro."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night as part of a speed dating event.  

Its layout worked perfect for the event...mostly.  Some of the tables were right next to one another; I am unsure if I would want to be in the place during a regular night, assuming it got to capacity.  

The interior is super classy.  Great lighting behind the bar.  It certainly qualifies as being upscale.  

I'm sure this was a problem with just the time we ~ 40 speed daters were here but they really needed one other person behind the bar.  The one or two girls serving were overwhelmed.  

My biggest gripe is that the Manhattan was not worth the $13 or so.  On the menu it was advertised as something special and one of the best in the city (why I ordered it despite being in a vodka bar).  No.  I watched it get made and it was nothing more than Crown Royal, your standard sweet vermouth and a dash of the same bitters you can get at No Frills.  With cocktail culture all the rage people expect something special when they order the standard drinks and are paying more than $10 for the pleasure.  Either the bitters has to be made in house, or the booze has to be something you can not easily get at the LCBO.  Or it has to have some extra ingredient.  This was same exact Manhattan I make at home for under a dollar.  

Should have ordered vodka instead!

I really do not see myself coming back here unless I was meeting a date after work (work is just down the street).  It seems like it could work as that one place you meet for a quick drink either to begin or end a date.  Even then, there are so many other choices.  Give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"The selection along King and Wellington East can sometimes pale to their Westerly and more pompous counterparts, but that's why I love this neighbourhood for going out. Troika is no exception. No signs outside to mark its presence, just a very enticing long entrance way to seduce the right client√®le. 

The decor is typical of the bar/clubs in the area - classically beautiful, chandeliers, dark lighting and luxurious furniture. The only odd part about the layout is that the lounge is very narrow and the bar runs the length of the lounge. The walkway is further narrowed by table service opposite to the bar, so people end up being crammed the entire length of the bar. At the end of the lounge is the presumed dance floor, but the only place to dance is in front of an elevated bottle service/DJ area with thrones for chairs, reminiscent of some medieval court area for all to judge. 

Nevertheless, my friends and I have dubbed this Pravda lite. The comparisons are uncanny. They both specialize in vodka, both have sexy interiors and the usual drummer from Pravda just happened to be on site the very Friday night we showed up. 

The one thing Pravda does much better is ventilation. The slightest dancing made the entire dancefloor drip in sweat. With the DJ dropping some great mixes, it was a tough choice to perspire or look elegant; we embraced both and made the night at Troika one for the ages. 

Definitely check this lounge/club/bar out if you're looking for something a little smaller, a little different and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place.  Atmosphere is very nice - gorgeous decor but very limited selection.  Apparently the items advertised on their website are not available to actually order.  For the selection and price, probably won't come back."}
