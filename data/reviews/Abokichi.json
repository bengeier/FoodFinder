{"text":"I went there for the first time today and tried their roasted sweet potato sandwich in a whole wheat tortilla. Sooo Yummy! I've never had anything like it before but it was super delicious."}
{"text":"We visited them yesterday and loved it. It's a no frills eatery with good food at very reasonable prices. We tried 3 different types of onigiri (triangular shaped rice balls with stuffing inside); Italiano, Soboro, Chilli+kelp. We also tried their spinach Salad and Moroccan mint iced tea. Everything was great. We'll definitely return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's very frustrating that they still list this location on their website even though it's closed! Should've checked yelp before going all the way there!"}
{"text":"AWESOME, just awesome. Onigiri is basically Japanese rice balls that usually have filling (anything you want really!) inside. It's perfect for snack, or bento or picnics. It happens to be one of my favorite simple foods to make for fun. You can find a mold made of magnolia wood to assist you in making these super cool rice balls! This joint is fairly new, incredibly close to Dupont station and is a smallish establishment. It has only 2 tables on the inside and 2 tables on the outside.   Now! Let's talk about the actual onigiri. I went on a Sunday with my boyfriend so unfortunately there were only 2 flavors/types of rice balls. BUT! We got the best kinds, the most popular two flavors which was gomuku and kelp + chili. My preference was the kelp and chili while my boyfriend's was the gomuku which is more meaty. The kelp and chili I believe is the vegan version. Both are light, healthy, and delicious. It's really a cute place and worth visiting if you are in that area! The lady that owns the joint was so sweet and informative for my curiosity about the business. Really cool spot, rustic ambiance, close to TTC, go visit. go go go!"}
{"text":"We tried this place today for first time, and ordered delivery. I had The Madison sandwich, which had a spicy-kick to it (but not too spicy) was delicious! Ordered online and delivery was fast! Will be trying them again for sure!"}
{"text":"I went in to grab a quick bite when I was in the area. This place is awesome! It offers lots of different sandwiches, salads (Caesar, coleslaw and spinach) as well an an array of drinks. I got an Albany sandwich. It came on a grilled panini. Yum! And the Moroccan mint iced tea will definitely be a must for all my future visits. It's refreshing and delish. The woman who served me was also very polite and made quick work of my order. You can pay with cards and it's a cute place to sit and eat in. I highly recommend! Next time I will have to try their specialty, the Japanese rice balls. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of \"The Dupont\". It's always good. The owners are lovely people. Consistently satisfying food."}
{"text":"It might be small, but this place is your quintessential artisanal eatery, serving sandwiches, salads and Japanese rice balls. What an eclectic menu!  I highly recommend ordering The Huron (pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich) and the Spinach salad (which features baby spinach, candied pecans and dried cranberries) together - the sweetness of the pecans perfectly complements the savory pulled pork.   Random remark: I'm not a fan of their new logo but that's beside the point."}
