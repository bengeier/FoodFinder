{"text":"I love hotdogs! I love them so much I have been known to accidentally go the long way home when I was hungry so that I had an excuse to stop at Ikea for one. 
I was sadden to find out that I could have been going the long way home past Frank & Mabels instead this whole time!

Went to the Calgary Farmers Market to meet a friend for lunch at 12:30 on a Friday. Firstly, don't do this to yourself. Wait until at least 1pm. It was a zoo of cars and people that really cleared out after the lunch rush. Secondly, when you do go to the market bypass all the other food options and head here for some delightful dogs.

You can get dogs plain or loaded, baked potatoes with a sundry of toppings, meal deals or just items on their own. Ordering is easy and quick, they have just enough options to give you choice but not so may you cant make a decision. Nice surprise was once my potato and dog were loaded up and cheesed, they were put in a warming draw so the cheese got a little melty. This is an extra step I would never have expected and really appreciated. Think my combo of dog with cheese, loaded baked potato and pop came to $14, really comparable with a meal other places and felt the quality was great.

Did I manage to take a pic so you could see how great it all looked? Nope. I was too busy eating and enjoying to think about pictures. Next time I will show some restraint and get a picture taken first... no promises though.

Cant wait to go the long way home so I have an excuse to stop here again. Thank you for the amazing quality food!"}
{"text":"I have a specialty hotdog shaped hole in my heart after my last fav closed this spring so I was happy to try a new place while at Calgary Farmer's Market. 

I ordered a mexican style falafel dog and a italian style potato (I'm sorry I forget their cuter names).  The falafel dog is not my favorite I'll be honest and I'd be happy to see them get a real veggie dog instead but I was a fan of the mexican flavor.  I'm still not sure how I feel about the potatoes considering I don't like baked potatoes and I was lead to believe they were still amazing.   The toppings were good,   the italian profile was abundant with fresh herbs and balsamic reduction but it was still a baked potato and a large one at that so I found I had too much potatoness to delicious topping ratio for my preference.   My dislike of the potatoes was not shared but others at the table that quite liked them (if anything it was just a but much for one person for them).  Overall I had a good lunch here which made my tummy happy.  A dog, potatoe and pop was $10ish so not bad at all and very filling with that potato in there.

Going back I'd probably get another hotdog but leave to potato and maybe get some of the icecream instead which looked good but we skipped this round."}
