{"text":"Saw this new restaurant while looking for burger joints and decided to try it for lunch. The staff at the front counter were extremely friendly and were ready to take your order or answer any questions. I ordered the cheddar bacon burger, and it was delicious!! The only thing I wanted more of was onions. Two onion ring slices on a burger are not enough. Each burger order comes with a side, and for mine I ordered onion rings with a side of ranch. If they were frozen onion rings, which I doubt, you couldn't tell. They were crispy and not too oily. You could tell everything was prepared fresh, and was still amazing after driving home with the food."}
{"text":"The food was good, it was....... but this is North Carolina so you have A TON of competition!!!!! The girls taking my order were super friendly, very helpful. Kind of tight seating but overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit here!

The owner, Barret, has apparently been in the restaurant business since he was sixteen. Starting as a bus boy and made it to General Manager by twenty four. He's helped open several other restaurants in his time and with all that experience has decided to finally make one of his own so he can work closer to his family. 

Walking in the front door you are immediately hit with a wonderful smell. The menu is visible right away, half being above the counter and half on the wall to the left. One of my very few complaints is the small size of the restaurant, however I'm told even though they have only been open three weeks they are already in the process of acquiring the vacant location next door and expanding. I guess business has been good! 

Trying to get a decent variety in our selections I ordered a burger and fries and my wife picked the barbeque plate with baked beans and macaroni & cheese. Burger was perfectly cooked"}
{"text":"It's new, it's small, and it is FREAKING AMAZING!!!!  This place took over the old Subway shop on the end part of the strip mall by Food Lion (to the right of Food Lion).  And it needs to expand!

We got the Big Q sandwich.  Comes with a side, and we tried the beans and the Mac & cheese.  The pork is out of this world!  They use a rub and I don't know what it is, but it is the bomb!!  Now, it has a little bite to it, but it is not overpowering.  Four sauces to try, my favorite is their house Fat Boys bbq sauce.  A touch of Eastern Carolina vinegar with a tiny touch of sweet & smokey - the perfect compliment!  I am not even that huge a bbq fan, but this will convert anybody!

Then the dessert..... Oh... My... God....!!!  We just happened to be sitting next to the owner's folks who stopped by to eat, and struck up a conversation (lovely people!).  They asked if we had checked out the dessert menu yet.  They recommended the Krispy Kreme sundae.  I definitely recommend sharing this!  3 *WARM* Krispy Kreme doughnuts topped with soft serve,  carmel & whipped cream (we skipped the strawberry topping).  Holy Crap!!  It should be called Satan's Delight!!  Even though it is big, it is not a heavy dessert at all.

Just come here and try it!!  So many choices (8 chicken sandwiches, salads, hot dogs, burgers up to TRIPLES, and of course the BBQ!)!!  JUST DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the baked beans and the BBQ.

The Mac and Cheese was pretty good too but the Beans and Que are so great that they overshadow it. 

They have a pretty vast menu, I'm looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Juicy Lucille was a great burger and the Cheese Fries were awesome. I look forward to trying more items from their menu.  The staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I'm an R&B singer who's on the road a lot performing in various cities. Tonight my wife and I stopped in to try out the new place near the house. The whole experience was amazing to say the least. Based on our experiences at other eateries around the country we found the service to be top notch starting with the young lady who took our order. She was very  pleasant with a warm smile. There was a little boy asking a question when we walked in to order. She saw us. I told her to finish with the little man because he was having a great experience as well. Probably placing an order for the first time. Lil man first bump me and sat down with his dad. She turned to us with a bright smile took our order. Told us about the different types of pork sandwiches which was refreshing since it was our first time there. When it was all said and done we found the portions was greater than the cost. I recommend everyone in the Concord/ Charlotte area please swing by for good pork and warm greeting."}
{"text":"This could be a great place if food was better! Burger was much smaller than bun. BBQ on sandwich was lukewarm and had a very large chunk of pork fat in it! Fries were soggy and lukewarm also. Visited when only few other customers so expected food would be hot and better. Great location but not worth it for quality of food."}
{"text":"I have tried several things on the menu and been happy with everything. Onion rings are my fave, they have a light, airy, flakey batter. The burgers are fresh patties, mac n chz is more 'cheesier' and not 'velveeta-y', I liked it quite a bit. BBQ had a lot of flavor, sauce options were good. Chicken sandwich is my fave. It's a must try place, also sets itself apart with great service and clean tables. Staff is always checking on you and the owners father was greeting people one Saturday, he was a joy to chat with!"}
{"text":"Oh my, where do I begin? JOHNNY ROGER'S just opened on 29 where the Subway used to be at Pitt School Road. As I enter, the menu is to the left and written in a chalk board format. I wondered if someone actually had hand writing that nice. It has a simple menu which I like. Too many restaurants try to have something for everyone and they need to stick to a simple menu and do the things they have well. Johnny Roger's does. The decor is a rustic look that is popular now and fits perfectly with the menu. There is seating outside also. Doggies are welcome outside I heard while I was there. You order at the counter. The people at the register were very nice and friendly. They even laughed at my silly joke. After ordering , I sat and looked around. I was fascinated by the chalk written menu. I have really bad handwriting but I love nice handwriting.  Someone ordered a Chocolate Chip Cookie sundae...holy cow! It looked way good!!! It took about 10 minutes to get our food. I didn't think that was bad considering how busy they were. Another thing I watched while waiting was the guys cooking in what is a limited space. They looked like a well oiled machine. As for the food, I can speak to the burgers, tomato-cucumber salad and the fries all of which were top notch. The burger was meaty, perfectly cooked with blue cheese crumbles, yum! I am trying to eat better (right, so I got a burger) so I got the cuke-tomato salad. It did not disappoint.  Red wine vinegar and I would say a little sugar but not too much mixed with the veggies. I did not get desert but there were 6 selections. The kids menu was excellent. So many restaurants have chicken tenders and burgers and that's it for the kiddos. JR had 6 or 7 items. I cant remember. Over all, Johnny Roger's was excellent top to bottom. I am so happy they are so close!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try new burger joint with friends. From the outside it looks really small but there is ample room inside. The service is excellent. Staff makes you feel like your hanging with friends.  They have a nice variety of items on the menu besides burgers. I was able to get sweet potatoe fries which were excellent to go with my Bacon cheeseburger with typical fixings. Was very fresh and very little wait time. 
Will definately visit again. Refreshing to eat fast food that doesn't taste like fast food."}
