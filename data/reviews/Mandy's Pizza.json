{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place out as we don't eat gluten or dairy and they offer gf pizza & vegan cheese, which we are thrilled about! We ordered a pizza and wings and I will say that we both agreed they tasted great- no complaints there. However, there were 2 big issues we had with our experience: 1) They only offer 1 size of gf pizza; for an average pizza place this might be understandable but when at least 1/2 of your advertising efforts are put toward claiming to be \"allergen friendly pizza place\"- it should be expected that you offer more than one size pizza as my husband and I splitting 4 slices was pretty disappointing...so why didn't we order a 2nd pizza? Well, that leads me to the 2nd issue- the price...$24 for a small pizza (4 small slices) and 6 wings is MUCH MORE than a little on the pricey side. Again, while the food was good, with all the GF options coming available now, we will spend less $ getting more pizza elsewhere.   Please lower your prices & offer more than on sized pizza Mandy's because we'd really like to come back!"}
{"text":"We order from this place at least once a week. Their Award-Winning White Pizza, straight out of the oven, is literally the best slice I've ever eaten. Mandy's crust isn't thin enough to be considered New York-style, but isn't overly bread-y, either. The cheese tastes fresh and sharp, and they know how to wield an herb-shaker. What puts it over the top for me are the tomatoes they top their white pizza with...even in December, still firm, red, and full-bodied, like an in-season, vine-ripened Roma.   Don't let the curt manners of the sales associates and the no-frills dine-in area put you off this amazing pizza."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed with the change from Mandy's to Pastoli's.  While they continue to advertise as allergen-friendly and vegan-friendly, the fries are cooked in the same fryer now with the meat products.  They will still have some of the old vegan pizzas in stock, but may not be as committed to serving Mandy's old customers, as when we went recently, the vegan pork and vegan chicken were out of stock so none of their popular vegan menu items could be made except the vegan white pizza which is not very exciting.  So, if you are vegan, and ate at this Mandy's, you may want to call first and ask about what Pastoli's can make on the day when you're going.  Also, no fries on the new vegan menu."}
{"text":"If you have to eat gluten free - you need to eat here. The pizza and hoagies are awesome! HOWEVER the service is lacking here. On more than one occasion they \"forgot\" to make my food...."}
{"text":"Got a grilled chicken salad from them. It was excellent, one of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the least attractive calzones I've ever had. Overfilled with ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, unfresh spinach, a crust that managed to be too thin and tasteless. Overall an off-putting flavor. I understand why the owner promotes gluten-free pizza, but if this is all that can be done gluten-free, no thanks."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had since moving to Pittsburgh...Fresh dough, lots of cheese, great sauce-have yet to find a better pizza in the north hills...Also the buffalo chicken pizza, pepperoni rolls, and cinnapuffs are outstanding. Only gripe is I wish they had later hours, 10pm on a Fri/Sat seems pretty early to close for a pizza place."}
{"text":"I signed up for emails and received an email for a free personal size pizza on my birthday. It was a hectic evening, my wife and I had to be somewhere and didn't have time to eat dinner. I called Mandy's and ordered my free pizza. For a personal size pizza it was big! We split on our way to our appointment. It was excellent, and the owner didn't chide me to order anything else. Who says there's no such thing as a free lunch? \"I have bought several pizza there since that pizza and they're always hot and fresh? Unlike a couple other pizza joints in West View."}
{"text":"We moved here this year and we found Mandy's soon after moving right down the street from them.  It wasn't hard to fall in love with their pizza.  The crust is perfectly raised and the cheeses they use have that perfect flavor.  My personal favorite to get is jalepeno and onions.    Another plus is they deliver when you just aren't up for getting out of pjs.  They're always on time and very friendly when they arrive.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is totally delicious.  If we lived closer to Mandy's I'm afraid they'd get all my money.  Planning on trying the rest of the gluten free menu soon!"}
{"text":"This Pizza shop has some of the best food in Pittsburgh. The customer service is outstanding and drivers are quick, friendly and the food it right out of the oven fresh!"}
{"text":"Ignorant staff, rude, not friendly at all.  We ate there, the pizza wasn't bad, the atmosphere was acceptable, but neither weighed above the horrible service under watch of the gentleman who was either the owner or manager.  Mandy's better find another, less personable business venture!"}
{"text":"Mandy's Pizza has the BEST gluten-free pizza. And I've tried a lot of gluten-free pizzas. It is simply phenomenal. Awesome crust, perfect thickness, perfect texture. Amazingly tasty blend of cheese with a bit of a smoky flavor. I've also had their calzone, which is the only gluten-free calzone I've seen anywhere, and it's fantastic as well. My only hope is that someday they will open another location south of the city for those of us who live down this way!"}
{"text":"Both Mandy's are always convenient, fast, fresh and delicious.  The people working there have always been nice, and seem to care about your pizza service.  They deliver, and offer pick-up. Try them out sometime!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in the Pittsburgh area! Quick service and the owner is super friendly. Definitely worth it. They have lots of allergen options"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Mandy's since they opened in Squirrel Hill. I love their veggie meat and their veggie hoagies and pizzas. I ordered lunch delivery from them today. I ordered 2 large vegan hoagies, along with breadsticks and fries. I specifically asked if they had vegan meat and they checked and said \"yes, we do.\"  When the order was delivered I cut a slice of the vegan hoagie and nearly threw up. (Let's put this in perspective, every time I have ordered from this place I have received hoagies with a vegan meat substitute, likely beyond meat). I opened the sandwich, it looked like the hoagie was stuffed with artichokes. So I call them and initially the male who answered told me \"it's not artichokes, it's vegan meat, the chef is standing right here, let me put him on\". Then a lady comes on the line and I explain it to her. She responds with \"oh it's not artichokes, it's jackfruit! And we are no longer Mandy's, we are Pastelli's (sp?) as of last week.  We had a taste test and everyone loved jackfruit as a meat alternative.\"  I'm sorry but it's never appropriate to bait and switch, especially if you have the same phone number and menu as Mandy's, you tell me you have vegan meat, to then switch it with jackfruit. Oh and btw I didn't get a refund!  I paid $30 for jackfruit sandwiches that I won't touch. Just amazing!  Needless to say I will never ever ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience with the owner of the north side location, so when I moved to west view I was hesitant to try this place again. I am happy to say I was surprised by the west view location food is consistently good service is great. Pizza is average but the hoagies are awesome!"}
{"text":"Really want to like this place is it is close but I just can't.  The third and last time we tried them we ordered their \"monster 32\"pizza on Halloween and a dozen wings.  The price was over 60 bucks and the pizza was extremely soggy.  Since we paid so much,I emailed the owner back immediately but he never replied."}
{"text":"I love their lactose free cheese pizza. It's the only place I can find when I really want pizza however it's not worth the awful customer service, long delivery time and unpredictable pricing. After dealing with the same crabby guy on the phone time after time to get my oh so desired veggie delight lactose free pizza, I started asking questions like: why are you charging me for gluten free pizza for 12 dollars when all I need is lactose free cheese for 10 dollars and they're explanation was not oh we will honor what our online menu says. It was well that menu is wrong amd the pizza sizes were different and the excuses went on and on with the same usual tone of \"I don't need this customers annoying questions\" attitude. Well, I'm done with this place. I'm not desperate enough to pay $4 extra for fake cheese (instead of $1.50 like it says on the menu) and be treated like crap in the process!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was not impressed.  Very doughy, soggy and chewy, not crispy at all and too thick for my taste.  I had asked for well done but it was not well done, and asked for extra sauce but  there was not enough at all!  The pepperoni and sausage were tasty, but the mushrooms were rubbery and right from the can.  I will continue my search for a great pizza in the north boros, alas Mandy's pizza was not the one."}
{"text":"Poker machine gambling hole. These bums dont pay state local or federal wage taxes."}
{"text":"Excellent spinach and feta pizza! We eat here once a week and always have delicious food. The chicken wings are excellent too! The drivers are friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"We have ordered a pizza and waited long time. But at the end, they gave us a hoagie... The lady there promised to refund us, but we never received it."}
{"text":"Solid (hawaiian) pizza. Very good gluten free pizza. Definitely a take out/ delivery place. Flat diet coke from the fountain. Giant wings underwhelming.."}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free Pizza in Pittsburgh! Steak hoagie was awesome, bun stayed firm through the whole sandwich. Don't forget the fries from a dedicated fryer. Desserts options are also available. I enjoy the giant cookies and the brownie bites. Gluten free eaters rejoice, they are also affordable."}
{"text":"Sort of a catch 22.  Highly enjoy the food at this location, but the workers (the order takers) are hands huge pricks.  The first time when they were literally 30 minutes LATE with a delivery (not 30 minutes from when we ordered) & we called, the man who.answered the phone acted as if he could care less that we were waiting close to 2'hours for a delivery. A month later we decided to pick up our order. The guy working there pretty much slammed our order down.  On our way out the door we overheard him mumbling because we opted not to tip for numerous reasons. Tonight was the final straw.  We placed an order for delivery.  Not only was the total $3 higher than the menu price , but when we asked if we could pay over the phone with.a credit card, he said \"we don't take cards for orders that cheap\".  I didn't realize $12 for a chicken hoagie was \"that cheap\".  Regardless, this was definitely strike number 3 considering we actually enjoy the food.  Unfortunately the a$$hole(s) that work at this location are not.worth the hassle."}
{"text":"One thing I hate is eating out or getting take out, and being disappointed.   We decided to get Mandys a try for a quick dinner tonight and our expectations were completely exceeded.  The white Pizza is absolutely phenomenal!  Not the typical boring cheese and tomato,  the melted cheese plus pieces of feta,  tomato, and onions -  needless to say was very flavorful and not heavy at all.   We also got a small cheese Pizza for our daughter which was also very good!  The icing on the cake was the cinnapuffs...  They're a mix between a funnel cake and donut hole,  but so light and delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!  Overall were extremely pleased,  money well spent and we will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a mess.  First, we were told 45 minutes for pick up.  Really?  For pick up?  Does your oven fit only one pizza?  Haven't you been doing this a long time?  Second, we arrived 10 minutes early, but when it was 45 minutes since our call, we heard the guy in the back yelling at someone to make what we could hear as our order.  It was another 15 minutes from that point.  So, one hour in all.  Third, there were about 4-5 people standing around waiting for their orders also.  We all got to listen to the owner or manager verbally abusing everyone and anyone from his staff within earshot.  It was like being at the house of an alcoholic in the middle of a rage.  The poor women out in front and all the customers seemed to be walking on eggshells.    If you care at all about a person's sense of dignity, no one should patronize this place simply because this guy is there.  Fourth, their prices are ridiculous.  Way too much as the pizza was pretty average.  I don't know how they got this rating for best pizza in the North.  Hogwash.  Bellisario's, Luciano's, Mamma Lucia or Monte Cello's all have better pizza.    Lastly, there's a sign over every table about how you better tip, and a large one over the register saying how you should use cash at their establishment instead of a credit card because cc fees destroy small businesses.  Why have a cc machine then?!  Make it cash only, or, join the next century!"}
{"text":"The pizza and wings here are either awesome or the worst. I think it depends on who is the chef that night. We once had a super cheesy delicious pizza and saucy wings. The very next time our pizza barely had any cheese and the wings were dry. We decided to order a third time as the tie breaker.  We were told 40-45 minutes for delivery. I called at the one hour mark and was told the pizza would literally be there in seconds. After 20 minutes I called again and spoke with the owner. He said \"All i can say is im sorry\". He never offered to call the driver to see if he was close. He said the same thing as before, the pizza would be there in seconds. I called back 5 minutes later to cancel the order because at that point we were feeding our son something else for dinner. The owner told me that he doesn't think he would be able to get in touch with the driver to cancel the order. NOT MY PROBLEM I told him. We no longer wanted their pizza especially after knowing it had been sitting in the backseat of a car for over an hour! He never offered for us to just keep the pizza if the driver ever showed up. He just said ok and hung up the phone. They lost a customer that night."}
{"text":"Great pizza, some of the other concoctions they come up with might even be better. They have gluten free pizza and desserts so they really take care of everyone."}
{"text":"I would have rated Mandy's higher; however, there have been a few misses.  First off, I am gluten free and let me say when done properly/ 90% of the time their pizza is amazing.  My personal favorite is the gf buffalo chicken pizza, it is a must try.  I also just say that they seem to have like a bacon, chicken, ranch gf pizza.... so that's next on my list.   Now to that other 10%... so their delivery drivers are not always the nicest.  Most of them are amazing, super helpful and if something's wrong i swear one almost started sprinting back on foot while apologizing.  I guess i had one bad experience, which after ordering off of grubhub and specifically giving the information that my buzzer did not work and to call my cell... well lets just say that was all lost in translation.  What resulted was after a long day of work, i was basically yelled at by the delivery driver for 1) ordering off of grubhub for delivery at all 2) not answering the buzzer ( which did not buzz) 3) and him having to call back to home base to get my number.  to make matters worse during that one instance, the cheese wasnt even melted on the pizza... all i can say is that they must have been very busy that night.  Also expect that Mandy's will be busy and it may take anywhere from 30 min to 75 min to get your pizza for delivery.  if you go and pick it up... it'll usually be ready in around 20. my other experiences with Mandy's, the staff, the owner etc have been positive and friendly. Definitely going back, love this place...just be aware that if you use grubhub... and leave instructions for delivery... there might be a problem."}
{"text":"I like the option of vegan and gluten free pizza. The white pizza was very good. Everyone there is very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Not even deserving of a star. A terrible place, with even worse food. Honestly, if you put sauce and mozzarella cheese on cardboard, you'd have a much better tasting pie than the garbage this place calls \"pizza.\""}
{"text":"We had a vegan buffalo hoagie and the vegan white pizza. Both delicious! I would recommend to anyone and glad they have gluten free and vegan options."}
{"text":"Wonderful gluten free menu.  We've ordered here quite a bit.  Gf pizza is very good and the gluten free wings are GREAT.  Hits the spot for gluten free fried chicken too."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Mandy's pizza and had an OK overall experience. The place is very small, has seating for maybe 12-15 people. There is literally one, hand-held menu for the entire restaurant. So if there is a group in front of you, which there was, then you have to wait until they are done reading and deciding before you get to read and decide, which forces other people behind you to wait longer.  As for the food itself, I ordered curly fries for an app and a 12-slice veggie w/ capicola which made for a good tasting pizza. The fries were ok but something that bugged me is that I was given ketchup packets. I've never dined inside a restaurant and been given ketchup packets. A ketchup bottle would go a long way (and provide me with the amount of ketchup I need). As for the pizza, it was a standard tasting pie. Nothing mind-blowing or bad about it, just your run-of-the-mill pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. Their specialty pizzas are fantastic. I love that they offer gluten free and vegan options, though I don't ever eat them.  Sometimes the staff (I assume the owner) can be very short on the phone or even in person. It often feels like you're bothering him by calling and placing an order and kind of kills the fun of ordering pizza.   A little kindness would go a long ways, and it's the reason why I took a star off."}

Also, as others have said they recently put up about 5 different signs shaming you if you pay with a credit card saying you're killing local businesses since they have to pay 1.5% transaction fees on cards.   I don't know whose brilliant idea that was, because it's only going to drive people away like me who never carry cash. They're losing more money from shaming people than from their transaction fees. Their prices are already the highest in the area by far, which I don't mind paying because it's high quality pizza.  A little kindness would go a long ways, and it's the reason why I took a star off."}
{"text":"Stay away!  Rude service from owner and employees, horrible food, long waits, don't waste your time.  Sad that a family business like this has gone so far down hill in the last 10 years."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars.  My wife called Mandy's pizza to order pizza for delivery.  The person taking orders was EXCEEDINGLY rude.  She was caring for our 4 month old daughter and asked for \"a second\" to get her card number.  The person said \"I wish I had one\", told her to call back and hung up on her.  When she did call back the person was still incredibly rude.  She figured, maybe it was just a terrible employee.  When she asked for their name she found out it was \"Steve, the owner\".  She tried to explain that she felt he was rude to her and he hung up on her again.  There are many fantastic pizza places in Pittsburgh.  We will NEVER patronize a place that treats it's customers like this.  I suggest you spare yourself the trouble and do the same.  In addition... I posted a review on Facebook of this place.  The owner wrote this LONG response explaining how he was right, my wife was wasting his time, and refusing to take any responsibility.  Then... he blocked me so I couldn't respond.  A REAL class act!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu and food! We love their vegan buffalo fake-chicken pizza! The only downside is that they consistently take longer than their own estimate."}
{"text":"The signs hung all over their store are very unsettling, they basically beg for tips and ask you not to pay with a card so they aren't charged the processing fee. The hoagies do not have nearly enough meat or toppings on them for the price. For what you pay and the atmosphere inside their shop, you get a much better value at one of the North Hill's other pizza establishments."}
{"text":"Although they seem to be working out some kinks, Mandy's food makes up for it. I love their many vegan options. I think their pizza is great. I can't wait to try everything on their unique vegan menu!"}
{"text":"We visited Mandy's recently, the reason was because I was diagnosed almost 2 years ago with Celiacs diseAse and have not had a pizza in that long. So I ordered a pizza wings, fries and a hoagie...... Yes a lot! And WOW it was worth it.... I took my first bite of the chicken wings and started crying.... Yes crying... Tears of joy...... I have not had one in years and it was incredible. My only complaint is that there is not a Mandy's closer to me.. I would order from there at least once a week. Now we will visit the west view location as often as we can. Thank you Mandy's for giving me such a wonderful experience,"}
{"text":"The owner is awfully rude. The pizza is good and it's great that they have so many allergen free products, but it's way too expensive all the way around. It's not nice to walk in to grab food and hear the owner screaming at his employees. Beware!"}
{"text":"Sure, they have great gluten-free, allergen-free options. Best in the city. But what really matters is taste and all of the food we've gotten there has been exceptionally good. I love the squeezie bread and the thick-crust pizza. My husband swears the hoagies are the best he's had. And the wings are really tasty, very meaty, cooked just right. I've always picked up because we live a good distance away, but with a GF eater in our family, the drive is well worth it. And, the owner CARES about doing the right thing - safety and quality are priority."}
{"text":"Great pizza and I love the vegan options (Vegan Cheese Pizza). Airy, chewy, perfect thin crust pizza. Gluten free options are also available."}
{"text":"Mandy's Pizza is a vegan junk food Mecca! The owner and staff are hilarious and so sweet. They make the best ooey, gooey vegan cheesey awesomeness! I wish it wasn't so far from us, but it makes the best treat. Thanks for having sooo many unhealthy, delicious options for vegans! You rock!"}
{"text":"Just ordered off of this pizza place not too long ago. I recommend NOT ordering from this pizza place. Their food used to be extremely good but now it just makes me sick in the stomach & I throw up just eating it! I give this pizza place 2 thumbs down. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Mandy's offers some great pizza and hoagie options for those with food allergies. Things started out great, and we expected to be loyal customers. On several occasions though, the food took 2x as long as their estimated time. When we went to pick it up the store did not seem visibly crowded and the staff was not rushing like they were backed up. I have worked at a pizza parlor before and know what it looks like behind the counter in the middle of a rush. This wasn't it. Then, they decided their advertised coupons without an expiration date were no longer accepted. The final straw was when they posted a sexist ad seeking a \"front counter girl,\" a \"cashier,\" and asked if moms or dads had any \"nice daughters\" who wanted to apply. When I commented that boys make great workers too, they deleted my comments and blocked me."}
{"text":"No one in my entire household will eat at Mandys. The only good thing about this restuarant is that they have an atm machine inside. Mandy's advertises \"The biggest Wings in the Burgh\" Okay that exclamation is gross.  I tried to like Mandy's because it's three doors up from my house, but I can't.  The biggest wings in the burgh or undercooked and bloody around the bone. They have shady people in there all hours of the day. The cheese and sauce they use on their pizzas is completely tasteless and flavorless.  I did have some luck with their spicey fries. However fries alone are not enough to make me like a place"}
{"text":"Mandy's food is OK. The pizza is mediocre, often burnt,  but the sandwiches are very good. We moved to Observatory Hill about 18 months ago and we like to support local businesses. However, after 6 months of consistently terrible service we sadly had to find a new pizza place. Every single time I have called in an order I would be put on hold for several minutes right away. That is a long time to be on hold and I understand places get busy, but every time? To top it off the employees would often argue with me about my order \"we would like a large pizza.\" Employee: \"you mean a 16 inch?\" Me: \"I don't know, the menu I am using doesn't have the inches listed.\" Employee: \"Well it's 16 inches.\" Another time I was asked what size fries I wanted. I told them I didn't order fries. They had so much trouble understanding that I had not ordered fries that it turned into a yelling match. Never before in my life have I felt so harassed trying to place an order.  One time the delivery driver called my cell phone and hung up when I answered. I went outside and asked him why he just hung up. Driver : \"I can't spare the minutes.\" This is the same driver who brings his dog in the car and when he isn't making deliveries the dog sits in his car all day in front of the pizza shop. What someone else said about the employees looking like parolees is definitely spot on. Some drivers will just call your cell and not even GET OUT OF THEIR CAR to deliver your order, instead waiting for you to come to the drivers window.  On one occasion I went to pick up an order at the store and the counter near the door looked like the pick up area but it was actually at the other end of the counter. Therefore, I was simply ignored until I figured out I was standing at the wrong end. Then the employee tried to make me feel stupid by telling me \"Yeah, I had no idea why you were standing there. No one has ever stood there before.\"  Seriously?  It's just unbelievable how rude these people are. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I drive past Mandy's everyday on my way to and from work. After being taunted by their sign advertising a $7.99 large 16 cut pizza I eventually buckled and bought a pie. I'm one of the weirdos that doesn't love a mountain of cheese on my pizza, I prefer the sauce to cheese ratio to be equally balanced if not a little sauce heavy. The first time I ordered from here the pizza I received was tasty, however it was buried under a 1/2 thick layer of cheese. This not only makes for a saltier pizza, but in my opinion it results in nearly un-edible left overs.  I tried Mandy's a second time and asked for them to go lighter on the cheese. They happily made my pizza the way I like it which I really appreciated.  I'm giving Mandy's 3 stars because while the service is fast and friendly, the pizza just isn't anything crave-worthy. Yes, it will do in a pinch, however it's just not something I would go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"I had pizza from Mandy's at a catered event in June, and I wasn't impressed. The cheese pizza was just okay, and the buffalo chicken was tasteless, and the toppings wen't evenly distributed. The sauce was on the sweeter side, and the crust wasn't as crispy as I'd like it. The salad that came with it was pretty nondescript, too. On the box, it says it's PGH's most award-winning pizza. I don't know who's giving out these awards, but it's time for them to look elsewhere.  NOTE: This review was originally posted for the Observatory Hill location, but I'm pretty sure the pizza was purchased from this location, since the event was located in Oakland. (The listing for this location didn't exist when I posted it.)"}
{"text":"Awesome little place my mom has celiac  disease so we ordered gluten free white and the sausage pepperoni pizza and the roast beef flatbread so greater will definitely be back here thank you for great food"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to get Vegan pizza.  Sure, Spak Bros is alright, but seriously, they have nothing on Mandy's when it comes to their pizza.    Since it's located in the West View area, it is a little bit of a drive for an East Sider, but if my boyfriend and I have a pizza craving, this is where we head to!  More recently, I also tried a salad WHICH COMES WITH BRUSCHETTA!  Their house Italian was phenomenal!  Honestly, the service is always friendly and I have never been disappointed with anything I've gotten.    For those with food allergies or those with a vegan lifestyle this gives you the opportunity to have wonderful options of food you may typically not be able to have at a chain or even outside of your home."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, vegan price gouging and false advertising.  I called in my order, and when the person on the phone told me the price, it was significantly higher than the online menu.  Upon questioning the price, the person on the phone was extremely rude and refused to stand by their advertised price, saying it was an outdated menu (veganated menu on their website).  When I asked to cancel the order, I was told that would be impossible (even though I had just placed it and hadn't even gotten off the phone yet).  When I once again asked to cancel the order, I was told very rudely that he was never delivering to me and never call again, before hanging up.  I am sorely disappointed in the customer service presented."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love Mandy's pizza. Any time I am in the area, I stop into either this location or in Westview for their allergen and gluten free goodies. I've never gotten delivery so I can't comment on timing or quality in that regard, but my pizza, fries, wings and hoagie always come out fresh and delicious. Their fries are actually my favorite of all time. Holy heavenly potato.   Try their white pizza. It is perfection and chock full of veggie and cheesy goodies.   They also have an amazing selection of gluten free beers by the bottle, including my all time favorite Green's Dry Hopped Lager (naturally gluten free). It was voted no. 1 gluten free beer in the world. It is true. Stop in and enjoy Mandy's whether you have celiac, food allergies or no allergies at all! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love Mandy's Pizza (Westview). With 12 food allergies and intolerance, I thought my days of eating pizza, wings, french fries and hoagies were over. Nope! Not only does Mandy's serve all of these allergen-free goodies, but their \"regular\" (wheat, egg, dairy, etc) pizzas are incredible, too, so my family says. I make a point to eat here on a semi-weekly basis to get my fix. They use Daiya gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free cheese on their allergen free pizza crust and have a huge variety of allergen-free toppings. The AF pizzas are personal-sized, which I love. They use a dedicated fryer and area for their AF pizzas/fried goods and I have NEVER gotten sick once here. Leave it to a dedicated, awesome father of a son with food allergies to bring this heavenly pizza to Pittsburgh. THANK YOU, MANDY'S!! They also sell brownie and cookie mixes in the store! Yum! Oh, and you can buy their crusts to make your own pizzas at home at Whole Foods and Naturally Soergel's in the freezer section! Yay!"}
{"text":"Living across the street from Mandy's on the North Side, I stop over regularly!  I'm a huge fan of buffalo chicken, their buffalo chicken squeezy bread is a must try!   Their Sicilian Pizza is fantastic, you can tell they have a fresh crust.    As far as the rest if the menu items go, the sandwiches could feed an army.  They are big, and full of flavor.   The wings are also jumbo size, not the large 'wing dings' others try to pass off as jumbo wings.  Great flavor, as well."}
{"text":"Delicious but a little pricey, early hours.  Amazing pizza with fresh delicious toppings.  Great wings, very good calzones, and fast service."}
{"text":"Mandy's Pizza's popularity baffles me.  My program recently catered in this pizza for an event, and I would LOVE to know whose idea that was.  The first time I tried Mandy's was in West View because I needed gluten free pizza.  I was not impressed with the regular or gluten free but had only tried the cheese.  At our meeting, I tried to vegetable, pepperoni, and cheese.  Sadly, the cheese was the best of the bunch.  Have you ever seen a bunch of college students throw food away? I had not- until we got this pizza.  The pizza was cold and did not taste much.  The next day, everyone was complaining of not feeling well after eating this pizza.  The vegetable tasted like frozen spinach was on it, and the cheese on all of the pizzas was really greasy or something.  I really love pizza, and even though Mandy's constantly sends out coupons, I just have no interest in returning.  Maybe eating in is a different experience."}
{"text":"Great selection and has options for vegans and those that are gluten free.  Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are gluten free, you need to get here!! We split a capicola hoagie and a steak flatbread and fries and OMG, so tasty!!! And also too much food for two people :) The hoagie bun was tasty and not crumbly and the flatbread (made with pizza crust) was too. The fries were really good too - they tasted fresh and were kind of puffy.   The eat-in atmosphere is not great (very small and basic) but honestly the food is so tasty you won't even care. And the employees were very nice and seemed very knowledgeable about gluten!"}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation from a friend who went gluten-free.  They have gluten-free pizzas, which, remarkably, taste very much like a regular pizza (although they are a bit pricy!).  For the rest of us wheat-eaters, we got a buffalo chicken pizza.  This pizza just continued to strengthen my argument that adding fries to food makes it better.  I've never had a pizza with fries on it before, but this just worked. It was like loaded fries on a pizza.  If we didn't live quite so far away, we'd go here often, but we'll just have to stick to eating there when we visit our friends."}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is for the West View location.  Long day at work + poor planning = not having eaten for 10 hours and having nothing in the house suitable for Lent. Enter Mandy's Pizza, whose ad I spotted on the back of the Pennysaver. Their menu kind of cracked me up so I decided to give them a try (although I wish they delivered ice cream from West View).  The guy who answered the phone and took my order was SUPER competent (asked for my card number, got my address and helped me give him directions to it, etc.) and also really, really polite. I noted I was new to this area of town and he said \"Welcome to the neighborhood!\" Maybe I had too long a day at work, but I thought that was swell.  Delivery was fast (on a Friday night!) -- just half an hour from the time I ordered. Unfortunately, I ordered a 2L and only got a cup of pop, alas. The Buffalo Fries are great, but I must admit I was overwhelmed by the sheer size of them. There has to be 5lb of fries and cheese in here. The Buffalo wing flavor is quite strong, and next time I might ask for plain fries or half and half. Though, if I were drunk, they would have been A+ #1, so keep that in mind.  I also got a fish hoagie. The bread was excellent, the toppings were good, and the fish itself was cooked just about perfectly. Not at all dry, although it could use a bit of salt.  Mandy's also offers a GF pizza (?!) and accommodates allergy requests, which is pretty rare. Given the friendliness of the man who answered the phone, I would trust them to do their best to make an order properly for someone with food allergies.  The portions were HUGE, the prices are really great (even compared to other local pizza places), fast delivery, friendly employees... yeah, I'll be ordering again.  UPDATE 4/12: I've since ordered from Mandy's many, many times, and I think their telephone service is probably the best I've ever run into with delivery places. My roommates are converts now, too. Other dishes:  Honey Habanero chicken pizza is on FIRE. In a bad way. My stomach started to hurt after I ate one piece; it's not so much the sauce as it is the pound or so of jalapenos on top. Fairly tasty, though.  Wings are meh. I'm really picky about my wings, though, and I require them to be cooked crispy (basically, overcooked). These weren't, and were underseasoned (dry Cajun). Not my favorite, although they ARE huge and if you aren't as picky as I am I bet they're good.  Cod fish hoagie platter is a great deal; you get the hoagie plus fries and coleslaw at a good price. It was still big enough to be two meals for me."}

{"text":"As for the food, you can't beat it!  I'm giving this four stars only because of the service.  While the staff are not rude, they're not overly nice.  I usually feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone when I pick food up here.  However, the pizza is great, so I keep going back."}
{"text":"This review is only for the delivery service.  We are only a 10 minute drive from Mandy's during the worst traffic of the day.  I placed an order at 7:36 online and the pizza did not arrive until 9:15.  Pretty ridiculous.  I had to place the pizza in the oven for 10 minutes before we could even eat it.  After we heated it up though, it was pretty good pizza with excellent crust.  Step up the delivery game Mandy's!"}
{"text":"The lower reviews are so misleading! Me and my husband stopped by and we got pepperoni rolls and a grilled chicken sandwich. It was huge and very filling and tastes amazing!!! Loved it!! The ranch to dip the sandwich was soo tasty."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes good but the allergy free pizza only comes in a personal size and costs as much as a deluxe regular pizza. If paying $5 a slice is worth it to you then definitely order, if that's too expensive for you then don't.  Our pizza on time and was hot and as I said the flavor was good. I just wish the pizza was a bit larger for the price and I'd like the full menu to be better explained on the website and on eat24."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Mandy's was one of them.  I often drive by here and see their pickup special sign but have never taken advantage of it until this point.  Whenever I called up, I asked for a large cheese to go.  The worker on the other end of the phone asked me to confirm the size of the pizza and I told him the pickup special.  Whenever I got into the place I realized why he wanted to confirm the size as they had all of their sizes on the wall and I think they had 14\", 16\", 20\" and 30\".  Whoever orders that 30\" is certainly crazy as I imagine its a lot of pizza.  Anyways, the pizza that I had ordered was ready whenever I got there and I was in and out pretty quickly.  The guy that was working there wasn't exactly the friendliest guy in the world but he wasn't bad either and he got the job done.  The pizza itself was made of a thinner crust and the sauce on it was good, I think buoyed by the taste of oregano.  The cheeses that they used also tasted good and there was more cheese than sauce in the cheese to sauce ratio which I loved.  Overall it was a solid pizza and was favorite of the three that we went to.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Mandy's in the future.  The pizza that we tried was pretty good and I think it is pretty cool that they have an allergen-friendly/vegan menu."}
{"text":"SOOOOO GOOD!!!   1. Best gluten free food and pizza in the area, that's hard to find, especially in pittsburgh. Love that they are allergen friendly!! 100% the best!  2. My boyfriend and I have a hard time finding a place that has great gluten free and regular Pizza, and this place takes the cake!! He loves the pizza, sauce, wings, everything!   Definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free buffalo chicken pizza and gluten free Philly cheesesteak! I wish I lived in the area because I would be eating here at least once a week!! His son has celiac disease so they absolutely know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Mandy's allergen free pizza twice now. I'm super excited to have found such delicious, allergen friendly pizza close to my house. I have celiac disease and I'm lactose intolerant so I will definitely be eating here again!! Thank you Mandy's for being a great option for me!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the haters here...... I love this place.  It's not five star dining for sure, but the pizza is awesome and I have always gotten excellent service, nobody working there has ever been rude or looked dirty at all, just because people have tattoos doesn't make them dirty.  In fact the times my sons and I decide to eat there instead of taking pizza home, they've gone out of their way to make sure we had a good experience.  It's the best pizza around and the fries are great too."}
{"text":"We love this place!! The gluten free pizza is fantastic and my husband enjoyed his regular pizza too!  We've dined in twice and the pizza came fast.  Staff was friendly. They also have gf sandwiches, chicken fingers, and fries - which I look forward to trying!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! The two times I have been here I got a free beer, delicious pizza, and extremely friendly and personable staff. I will come here all the time for my pizza needs! And they have vegan and gluten free options. I haven't tried them yet but I'm sure they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Here's a great Pizza shop with two locations (the other one is in the North Side) for your convenience!  Not only that, but they deliver pretty far from their locations (ie. the West View branch delivers to us in Ben Avon).  The American food - hoagies, flatbread sandwiches, wings, etc., have all been extremely tasty in my experience.  But, what I'm really here to review is the pizza!  So far, I've tested a variety of their yummy pizzas.  They are huge pies, and Mandy's never skimps on the toppings!  However, the dough, though very good, is a little thick for my liking.  Yet recently, I had to completely reevaluate my opinion after trying \"The Pittsburgher\".  Now, if you like Primanti Bros. sandwiches, you will LOVE \"The Pittsburgher\".  Heaps of meat (your choice of turkey, capicola, roast beef, or corned beef) accompanied with tons of cheese, tomatoes, french fries, and cole slaw.... well, it's definitely something you'd only see in the 'Burgh.  The thicker dough works well to soak up the juices in this pie and, instead of the soggy experience you'd have if the dough was thin, you are left with absolute deliciousness!    Other than that, Mandy's offers gluten free dough and other options for those with food allergies.  Overall, a fabulous and unique Pittsburgh restaurant!"}
{"text":"I live close to this awesome little pizza joint that has both meat and vegan pizza options.   Some of the staff are so-so, but it's the food that counts! I came here not really knowing what I should order and asked about a few of the vegan pizzas on the menu and didn't really have any suggestions or clarification on some of the items at first..eventually I had to keep grilling them about things (i.e. can I do a half-and-half vegan pizza, what's the white pizza, etc.). But, keep in mind, it's a pizza joint, not a 5 star Michelin rated restaurant.   Mandy's couldn't do a half-and-half of which I wanted a half vegan white, and a half vegan pepperoni, so I ended up ordering a whole vegan white pizza. 've never had a vegan white pizza nor a 'real' white pizza (due to my allergies) and damn, it was good! I finished off the entire pie myself. I don't like red onions and ended up picking them off because I forgot to order the pizza without them, but the pizza was super yummy. I asked for a side of red marinara sauce (because I couldn't do my half-and-half) and that was more than sufficient to satiate my palate. The vegan white was yummy and it was not too creamy, greasy, or overwhelming in anyway, and Daiya cheese was used to top it off.   It's a bit expensive for the vegan pizzas, but the prices are comparable to other vegan pizzerias on the west coast, so Mandy's is not overpriced for the vegan pizzas. I'm glad Mandy's exists, especially because I'm severely allergic (i.e. I carry an Epi-pen and swig Benadryl like soda) to dairy, dairy by-products (lactose, whey, caesin, etc), fish, and shellfish, so it's another option for people like myself to eat and have a somewhat normal life when it comes to eating at restaurants. I did not have any allergic reactions (immediate or delayed), and I'm one of those super sensitive folks that quickly swell up end up in the ER.  If you're a football or hockey fan, they have TVs in the dining area for you to watch the games. There is also a waiting area with a couch and a few (sports) magazines at the front of the restaurant by the door/windows. All I know for sure is that during my clinical rotations in Pittsburgh, I'll probably be spending a lot of time at Mandy's eating vegan pizzas with whatever free evenings I might have. Yay!!  Hopefully staff will improve their customer service from what I'm reading from other reviews, but I had no problems with ordering my pizza and they were clear (albeit curt) with their answers when I grilled them about vegan items, cross-contamination, and specific ingredients on the menu. The vegan pizza is worth it though."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service ever and the best part is it was from the owner.... My fiance ordered a laarge white chicken pizza for dinner to be delivered one evening while I was doing computer work. She was never given a total when they hung up so i asked her to call back so i could get out the appropriate cash. she called right back and was told $32! I about threw up in my mouth. She asked why and was told because she was adding chicken to a specialty pizza. Regardless of the fact that is still obscene, she didnt want a specialty pizza she just wanted a white pizza with chicken. I told her to cancel the order and we would simply go elsewhere. The owner then informed her \"she would be blacklisted and never allowed to order from there again\" if she canceled.... WHAT A JOKE!"}
{"text":"Back when I was a kid, Mandy's was the best.  Everything was delicious, pizza, hoagies, and the massive super steak.  Now it just plain stinks. The service sucks, the food sucks, the prices suck.  The owner must be running a halfway house upstairs and using the parolees as workers because they all look fresh from prison. Most look as if they haven't seen soap in a month. These are the people touching your food.  On top of that they have a severe attitude problem. They act like they're doing you a favor for selling you a pizza.  I miss the Mandy's I used to know and I wish this place would change their name so I didn't feel compelled by nostalgia to eat there."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this pizza place for almost ten years now, and they never disappoint.  They even put some sort of special marinade on the tomatos that go into the side salads. The owner is an absolute sweetheart, and their delivery guys are never late. Plus they offer gluten free options in case you have special needs. My all time favorite order is the Italian dinner with sausage and meatballs baked into sauce with a perfect later of cheese oin top. It even comes with the side salads and some heavenly garlic bread. It's incredibly affordable and it can usually feed 2 people!  It's a family business that I will never stop recommending. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The staff is very nice and relatively efficient, but the food is just not very good. I appreciate the gluten free options for folks who have those restrictions. In my experience, the pizza has been overly sauced, burnt, and super greasy. When I ordered the pasta, it was all stuck together and an odd texture, as well as slightly cold. Delivery was prompt though."}
{"text":"Great pizza and hoagie's. At Mandy's, they make food the way restaurants used to make it, fresh, great tasting, and high quality.   My daughter only eats gluten free and of all the pizza places in western PA they have by far the best tasting and quality gluten and allergen free pizza.   The owner seems to always be here and is genuinely concerned about everyone's experience. This place is truly one of the hidden gems in Western PA!"}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time from Mandy's today. I ordered the cod hoagie platter and my boyfriend ordered the steak hoagie. The fish was so overcooked that it was like eating leather, my fries were soggy and I would guess the coleslaw was at least 3 days old given the brownish color. Where I used to work, the coleslaw we threw out on day 2 looked more appetizing. The steak hoagie was mediocre at best. Though they should probably rename it a steak-um hoagie. Then there is the $2 delivery fee they charge for the 1 mile journey. I doubt I will ever order from this place again."}
{"text":"I can't say I was overly impressed with my meal here. I ordered a vegan buffalo chicken hoagie and an order of spicy fries. The chicken they used was rubbery and didn't have much flavor to it. I did enjoy the vegan mozzarella that they used, and I don't like many vegan cheeses. Nothing tasted very fresh, and most vegan places tend to use better quality ingredients. The spicy fries were soggy and over seasoned with what tasted like Old Bay Seasoning. I really appreciate that they have so many vegan & gluten free options, but nothing has me feeling inclined to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered a thin crust, what they have in mind is this messy, doughey mess with too much sauce. Stop calling it a thin crust! What are you, stupid? This explains why there are so many things on the menu. I sort of want to try their gluten free pizza, but if they can't get a thin crust right, I dunno"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and really nice staff.  We waited longer than usual for our pizza so the manager gave us a free round of beer - I'll definitely be returning to this great neighborhood pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant via the find me gluten free app because I was at an orientation in town. The reviews on there were amazing. I have celiac disease and it is extremely hard for me to find somewhere they won't cross contaminate me. I went in and the owner was super super super nice joking around with me and carrying on conversation. He even threw a cookie at me for free they make homemade while I was sitting there. I am so surprised by some people's awful reviews on here. I am very glad I went in and formed my own opinion.  BY FAR the BEST pizza I have ever had. I got a chicken bacon ranch pizza.  I even drove to my fiancé's shop to have him try it (he is not gluten free) and he asked when we could go back because it is the best pizza in any form he has ever had. You people are crazy with the bad reviews on here. Keep up the high quality gluten free food!!"}
{"text":"I went there today for beer, not food, but I think it speaks wonders to the character of the staff and management (and perhaps owner).  I inquired beforehand how the beer was ordered and was told domestic was $10,99, import 18,99 for 6 packs.  I grabbed a six pack of Yuengling, and the manager or owner instructed the person with regard to something on how to ring it up.  The cashier told me $18,99.  I said The gentleman (manager or owner) said it was $10,99.  He said that Yuengling is an import even though it is \"Made Here\".  The manager/owner nodded his head in agreement, and than I mentioned that not only is it not an import, but its made in POTSVILLE PENNSYLVANIA.  Long story short, be very wary of spending your money at this business, because I promise they are scamming the students in the neighborhood because of their ignorance.  They should really be ashamed for trying to scam unsuspecting people.  Luckily I know better, and now you do too!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Resonable prices. We had medium xtra cheese pizza, poppers and a drink for $20. They have quite a beer selection. They have vegan friendly, glueten free selection on the menu too. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm really sad that I crave their gluten-free pizza and wings so much (they really are delicious). However, after at least five negative interactions with their management/owners, I can no longer frequent this business. They may love beer, pizza, and sports, but they may not even /like/ their customers.   Here is a list of customer service \"don'ts\" that I have learned from their establishment: 1. Deliver the wrong pizza, blamed it on the customer for \"ordering it wrong\", and then make them pay(!) to get it fixed. It's ok; they gave me 50% the second pizza even though they refused to refund the one I didn't want. What? 2. Make up an order with multiple errors, e.g., missing toppings, cold items, and refuse to offer compensation...or even apologize! 3. Have a large party. (Fine.) However, accidentally send pizzas that were supposed to go to two other customer tables to the party's table, don't even notice while the customers--both with small, hungry children--sit there waiting for 20 minutes, and then after they alert you to the mistake, do not apologize or offer compensation. 4. Increase the price on your chicken wings because \"chicken is getting so expensive\" even though no other wing places, e.g., Fat Heads, seems to have a chicken cost issue. 5. Charge $13 for a 12\" cheese only gluten-free pizza. News flash: GF ingredients do not cost 115% more than regular ingredients. e.g., City Oven charges an extra $2 for their 12\" GF, and at Uno's you can get *2* GF pizzas for $14 . That sounds about right. 6. When a customer asks for a to-go box, scoff and tell them that they \"ordered too much food.\" 7. (This one gets me the most.) Replace your water spigot with Sobe (so you can make more money!) and prohibit your customers from  ordering tap water. Force them to pay for bottled water (so you can make more money!). Seriously?  On a positive note, the non-management staff are awesome: friendly, helpful, and sympathetic. If the owners would leave and let their capable staff handle things, they might stop pissing people off.  If you go for the pizza... stay away from the management and remember: the customer is always wrong!"}
{"text":"Size Matters when your paying twice the price! Ordered the gluten free 12 inch 4 cut pizza. It cost over twice the price of the normal 12 inch. I brought it home ,opened the box and it looked small. I brought out my handy tape measure and it was 9 1/4 inches. That is close to 25 percent less pizza. I thought maybe someone screwed up ,after all stuff happens. So I decided to measure the box...10.5 inches.. So a 9 inch pizza in a 10.5 inch box and sell it to the suckers as a 12 inch pizza. Now I know why I was the only fool at the counter. The pizza was actually good but I don't like to be ripped off ,so this fool only gets fooled once."}
{"text":"I gave this place a couple shots but their customer service is just crap and they consistently messed up my order. Once I had a sandwich delivered, they messed it up and when I called to let them know they said \"If you bring it back in we'll remake it for you\" then immediately hung up. So I had to drive the wrong sandwich that I paid to have delivered back to them, then wait for them to make the correct one. No apology. This is one example of multiple bad experiences. Also there's an extremely rude and trashy sign on the wall inside about how they want you to pay in cash. Well it's 2018 and majority of people are going to pay with a credit or debit card and most likely do not even regularly carry cash. As a locally owned small business, I find that appalling. I would rather see a thoughtfully written sign about how credit card transactions are an extra $1 if it's that big of a deal to you. It comes across extremely rude and cheap."}
{"text":"I always heard about Mandy's pizza but it seemed too far of a drive - after hearing they opened up a spot in Squirrel Hill I immediately rushed over.  The vegan options are crazy awesome since they are using veganABC for their \"meat\" options. Vegan buffalo chicken pizza and white vegan pizza are some options that you probably miss if you've gone vegan. Best of all, they deliver! The crust is nice and flaky especially if you eat it there.  As much as I love Mandy's and have been dreaming about it I will say that they could use some improvements with the store. When I went the a/c was broken so it felt like we were sitting in a pizza oven while there. Not cute in the summer heat. Also, they serve your food with plastic utensils and flimsy little paper plates. I actually managed to cut through the paper plate with my plastic knife. I didn't even think that was possible. So, Mandy's please invest in some silverware and make sure to fix that a/c! Finally, extra vegan cheese cost an extra $3 which was ridiculously overpriced for the amount of extra cheese that actually came on the pizza. On a plus side, they are going to start selling beer in a month it seems :)  All in all I will come back but my visits would be more frequent if they fixed a few of the issues I mentioned."}
{"text":"Local pizza joint across from Oliver High School. I would say it depends on your taste, not my first choice of pizza in Pittsburgh.   Adequate? Yes"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to write this review, as I contacted the owners last week via email about recent problems with delivery. My complaints were not addressed. Saying this, Mandy's is an establishment that offers a variety of GF and allergen free foods. The problem with this being the one of the only establishments that does, they can skimp on quality and customer service and customers will continue to order because other options are scarce (Dominos... please.).   Anyways, I am GF and ordered regularly from Mandy's with no problem. However, the last three times my food took at least 2 hours to arrive after ordering and always showed up cold and old. I had to call each time to check on it, and was offered apologies but no refunds or delivery fees waived. I reached out to the owners via their website but my concerns were not addressed.   In ALL honesty, in the amount of time it takes for a cold product to show up at my door I could go to the store to buy ingredients and make GF pizza from scratch. If the owners do address my complaints I will update this review."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a hoagy about a year ago and it was really good. Called an order in a week or so ago, pizza, hoagy and wings, and they never showed up at my house. I called and the person said it was on the way and was kinda rude. An hour later and still a no show. I'm really glad that I didn't offer to put it on my credit card. Called the next day to speak to a manager or owner and was given an argument. I'm not sure who I was talking to. So I will spend my money elsewhere. Lots of other pizza places in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Cool pizzeria. All gluten-free crusts, but you wouldn't know it. A little greasy, the interior is nothing to look at, and the service is....odd. But it was a good pie and their commitment to quality, natural ingredients is important to me. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and tend to order out at least once a week. My first night in town I ordered pizza and wings from here. Lets just say as much as I move around and as many times as I order out it was one of the best pizzas and some of the best wings I have had in Pittsburgh."}
