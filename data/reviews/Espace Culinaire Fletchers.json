{"text":"After a week of indulgence, this was such a welcome break. I had an amazing eggplant tahini toast with roasted chickpeas on thick, whole wheat bread and a Brussels sprouts salad on the side. Filling and seriously delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I live basically two blocks from this cafe and always gave it a miss because it looked like a museum cafe, so I was expecting sub-par tea and bad sandwiches. 

How surprised I was to find that inside this unassuming little place was the most fancy-ass beautiful bagel experience I've ever had! 

A dense, sweet sesame bagel perched on a wooden plank next to a creamy white smear (an ACTUAL smear) of cream cheese, sprinkled with nuts, herbs and pistachio chunks, accompanied by some pleasingly vinegary pink pickled onions and a healthy helping of dill. And then there was the smoked salmon: billed as being ras-al-hanout spiced, I was eager to give it a try, and although I'm not sure how much the spice came out amongst the much stronger flavours of fish, dill and pickled onions, it was tender and soft, and the perfect amount for the bagel. 

The place is small and sparse, but that's what you get at cafes in this area sometimes (like Dispatch just across the road) - and it's vastly superior to the nearby Bagel Etc if you want a gourmet bagel experience. 

I can't believe it took me so long to visit!"}
{"text":"A wonderful stop in the Plateau for breakfast and lunch. Fresh, tasty, and original salads, Montreal bagels with delicious gravlax cured in house, and an incredible eggplant tartine. Don't forget the yummy baked goods.  I'll be back for more soon!"}
