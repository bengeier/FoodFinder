{"text":"My family and I have been going to J&R Kosher for years. It really is a fabulous establishment. In this family run establishment you feel like one of their own.  Susie, who is behind the cash, is always there to help. She has hints in the kitchen like no other so don't be afraid to ask her what to do with a piece of meat that you have no idea how to cook. She is there to help! Sidney's cuts are top notch! And if you like spicy, try the merguez (my husband doesn't let me leave there without buying some). The quality of their food is top notch and if there's something you can't find, they will find it for you which is why it's a pleasure to recommend J&R for your meat and chicken eating family."}
{"text":"I voyaged to canada a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this gem.

Everything is made/smoked/prepared in house, and all of their meats are top notch. 

Off the top of my head: 

Pastrami was amazing.
Hot Dogs were really good.
Steaks were top notch. 

Don't be afraid to combine all three of those meats into what I refer to as the Pastramisteakdog... yeah... it's good. 

I typically don't rate non-restaurant shops, but this deli was out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I recently sampled J&R during a hockey/ski retreat in Montreal.

All of the various smoked meats were some of the best I've ever had! The steaks and hot dogs were incredibly delicious!!

Please don't miss out on the phenomenal pulled beef!!!!


Will definitely be coming back here next time I'm up north-"}
{"text":"Its a little pricey, but the quality is amazing.  Their sausages, salamis and karnatzel a are all home made.
Staff is nice, but some of the regular customers are pushy, and this location isn't that big to begin with.
Amazing selection and always fresh."}
{"text":"At first I was a little surprised to see an old school Kosher butcher and deli in a shopping mall but as soon as I walked in I realized this place was special. 

The quality of the meat was second to none and the takeout and deli was delicious.  Try the general tsao Chinese chicken and the old fashioned smoked turkey. Out of this world. The knishes are made in-house and they have their own homemade hummus and moroccan salads. The pulled beef was a hit at my Sunday brunch and the kosher bacon was a pleasant surprise! 

You can't go wrong - there's a reason this place is still around after 60+ years."}
