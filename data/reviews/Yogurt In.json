{"text":"Watered down yogurt. 
The place did not allow u to sample which is good because the yogurt does not taste good.

Better just walk down to the next froyo place"}
{"text":"The owner/employee is not helpful at all!
We wanted some good frozen yogurt /sorbet but we saw a few kids filling up their cups with runny, almost melted, yogurt. 
They have a list of some interesting flavors so we kindly asked to sample the lemon sorbet.
The man behind the counter answered 

\"I don't have any samples right now.\"

That is the most absurd answer I have ever heard when asking for a sample.
HAHAHAHAHAAAA.
As if they have a special batch of sample-only yogurts and sorbets and they gave them all out earlier in the day.
This place loves when kids and other people fill up their cups. 
Reminds me of some of those places at the airport that love to sell their below-average-quality products and poor customer service to people who are just passing through who wouldn't have an opportunity to come again.
Just my opinion but I guess it's no loss to them."}
{"text":"Food was OK.....not what I expected for the price. Also the two ladies working got in an argument and were yelling at each other right in front of us. Awkward. Could get better crepes in las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came back at this amazing place and I don't regret it, Lizbeth is an amazing worker, she handles the registers and the grills at the same time, she also has a great costumer service skills...the Crepes were absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Food is good. But the employees who work there she doesn't even smile wasn't even polite."}
{"text":"One star is too many. I usually do not like to write a bad review on business if they at least are trying their honest best to take care of their customers. But this place truly sucks at all levels. Their \"yogurt\" taste like dirty water, actually, I rather drink the dirty water. But their worst criteria is their customer service or lack of it. The cashier got her training from the worthless manager. The manager had a very snappy, flamboyant atitude  with a chip on his shoulders (I did not understood why... maybe I did). The problem came about when my 14 year old autistic son  wanted to sample their vanilla flavor yogurt and the smileless cashier denying him because a group of 5 of us had already a total of 4 samples. All their samples truly sucked but I was still willing to buy my son his vanilla yogurt until that cashier went into yogurt protective mode.
Ownership should fire these people and start from scratch. Save your money and go somewhere else, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"This is not what i expected. I ordered the special crepe with glazed pecans , banana, nutella and strawberries,i didnt expect it to be so sweet and so soupy.The glazed pecans was so soupy that i think it was sweetened by condensed milk. I ended up eating just the bananas and strawberries. Not worth for my $10."}
{"text":"If you like rich crepes this place is for you. I stopped by and tried the Banana Lottie, I think that's what it's called and it was good. But very sweet and rich. Make sure to share the portions are super gigantic. Later I stopped by again and decided to go for savory and went with the Salmon crepe. It has a ton of cream cheese, of course it tasted delicious. Unfortunately I could only eat half again because it was rich and very huge. I think Man V Food would love this place, maybe not. But it's decent and the crepes are priced ok I paid $10 wish I had some one to share it with. The service was ok, nothing to rave about. I would recommend for a quick eat totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is the worst frozen yogurt joint I've ever been to.  I tried a few samples and they were all very odd and had a bad after taste. I decided to stick with the two flavors I ate last time wich were Pastachio and Peanut Butter. The Pastachio was okay. On the other hand, PB was so disgusting!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! Its Vegas but stil Wow 

Rude Rude Rude. I asked for sample cups , waited for 5 minutes while she is counting cash, cleaning, talking to her colleague and doing basically any thing else other than handing out a sample cup. Then she came out and told me that she will do the sampling!!! I asked her can I have samplle cups to get the samples myself ?  She said No , leave if you dont want !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from Jessica. No greeting, no response to any questions I asked. At first I thought she was being intentionally  rude, but now I think she was  simply mentally not present at all, so didn't bother to formulate a response to any of my questions. Half of the yogurt flavors were out of order and the ones they had were just OK. Wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Little place in the corner that really doesn't match the hotel but wanted frozen yogurt so decided to give it a chance.  Also saw them making crepes which smelled yummy.  They have basic flavors and toppings.  They all tasted pretty good.  Not sure I'll be back since I'm pretty sure there's better places especially since it's vegas."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite.  I had a sweet crepe with strawberries and cream, and a froyo with mochi and a few other fruit mixed in.  It was very sweet and exactly what I expected. The crepes are made fresh.  I'm a sucker for mochi, so that was great.  It does seem a little pricey and the location by the escalator isn't the greatest experience, but you would probably get that at most places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went to the Mandalay Bay location two days in a row. Looooooved it!

I'm not a big fan of ice cream or fro-yo in general, but I love smoothies. This place offers the option to make your own fro-yo smoothie! I combined strawberry, pineapple, and coconut flavored yogurts, then topped with chopped strawberry and pineapple and shredded coconut (I'm so creative.) IT WAS SO NOMS. The shredded coconut really put it over the moon.

The next morning, I split a crepe with a friend. Ham, cheddar jack, spinach and mushrooms with a side of alfredo sauce. I'm typically not a fan of omelette-type things first thing in the morning, but this was THE CAT'S PAJAMAS. OMG.

This place just needs to add a coffee machine so you're not forced to stand in the obnoxious Starbucks line next door to get your coffee fix."}
{"text":"Good Food - Horrendous Pompous Service

We went to this place and ordered two pretzels and a crepe.  We were watching the lady make my crepe, not saying anything.  The crepe station is surrounded by glass so people can watch.  After a couple of minutes the lady said NASTILY - \" you can sit down and we will call you when it is ready\"

Shocked, We walked a couple of feet away and still watched

The second lady put two pretzels in two bags and handed it to us, however she forgot the cheese and had to be asked for it.

The crepe was on the heater and I asked to Nasty woman did you forget to put ham in it.  She insisted she did, and I asked her to check.  Low and behold the Nasty girl realized she forgot and began to tear apart the crepe to add the ham.  I was not pleased with the messed up crepe, however I did not want to make them more upset because you know I am the paying customer.

They then gave me the crepe and I pointed out they forgot the sauce.  

This is getting a poor rating because of the above, the food was decent.  If the girls were decently nice I would have given it a three star.  I had to correct 3 mistakes and not once did they apologize for the mistakes or the outright rudeness.

{"text":"True. Not as good as Yougurtland. Not bad either. 49 cents an ounce is acceptable for a strip property. I had the pistachio, dulce de leche and blueberry acai. All were good."}
{"text":"Yogurt In has lots of toppings to choose and is very clean. The yogurt itself definitely has no flavor. I got coconut and vanilla custard and both did not taste right. I do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"Should have read read the reviews before trying.... Bad service! Went there 3 mins before closing and lady asks to take our order, we asked for one of the crepes. Now she said they are out of crepes. What? You're making a couple of them now! Then she changes her story that they are closed, what the heck is going on??? Where is the customer service at? I'm excepting a little more from the Mandalay Bay. We stay here and even though this is probably an independent place, our expectations of a really nice hotel charging higher prices isn't too much to ask of better service...right? We ordered a coffee and right away new it was really old. We added cream it turned gray. Gross. Just left not even worth he time to speak with the employees. Needs a better management team. And friendlier employees. If you don't like your job, fine but taking it out on the customers will only loose you business. Take the time remember your offering a service!"}
{"text":"Have only tried the frozen yogurt, not crepes, but think this is the best spot on the Strip for self-serve frozen yogurt.  49 cents an ounce is as cheap as you will find on the Strip (without going to Yogurtland at Town Square) and the selection of toppings and flavors is above average.  I wouldn't pick it over Yogurtland, but on the Strip this would always have my vote."}
{"text":"Not bad but not the best Yogurt shop. Machines seemed frozen and we had a hard time getting yogurt out. Flavors were as expected, but non of the cool Yogurtland seasonal flavors. $13 for 2 decent sized yogurts."}
{"text":"I guess I am spoiled by Sweet Cece's.  For 17 bucks worth of Yogurt it was pretty much a disappointment.  None of my flavors were really all that great.

Having said that, perhaps the \"and Crepes\" is where this place really shines, but I didn't have one of those.

I can't recommend this to anyone based on my experience here.  If you do Yogurt In, I hope you have better luck than I did."}
{"text":"Horrible experience the manager name Abraham was so rude he was yelling at his employees few people walked away after seen his attitude, when I paid for my crepe the cashier asked me if I wanted a ticket and I said no,so Abraham was calling my number ,but since I didn't had a ticket he shouted out loud!! \" I called once\" \" I called twice\" then whatever's and threw my crepe so I asked this other guy if he was calling my crepe and he was really nice and said I'm sorry here's your crepe! After that experience I would never go back there"}
{"text":"I ate here several times while staying at the Luxor and was happy each time. Nothing special. Nothing to write home about. Just plain frozen yogurt and crepes. No problem here!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the dairy during this time...my two sons had yogurt (chocolate and strawberry) and a friend of ours had whipped cream on her crepes tonight.  All three had to run for the bathroom soon after.  Something is spoiling the dairy tonight.  My other son only had a cup of non-dairy toppings and my wife had strawberry crepes with powdered sugar...they are both fine.  My boys were able to flush it out and are fine now but our friend is still in bed..probably for the rest of the night.  What a way to end her last night of her trip."}
{"text":"I ordered an egg white omelet. It was $11.89 after tax (meat was an extra $1). The staff was friendly. It took 9 minutes from when I ordered it until I received it (not too long). The omelet was nothing special, and very thin. It tasted okay. If the lines are longer other places I might come back here to try the frozen yogurt but definitely not for food again."}
{"text":"This self-serve frozen yogurt shop is located at Mandalay Place (right where Mandalay Place meets Mandalay Bay).  They had a decent though not great variety of flavors and toppings (fruit, nuts, candy bar, and Ghirardelli syrups; surprisingly, they were missing cereal).  The frozen yogurt (like chocolate and pumpkin) was okay--pretty good flavor and firm enough but not icy texture.

The problem with this frozen yogurt shop is that it is quite expensive ($0.49 per ounce).  While that high price should not be too much of a surprise considering that Yogurt In is located in Vegas, this place's quality and variety alone would put it in the average to below average range when compared to other frozen yogurt shops.

They also sell crepes here.  Service was quick and fine.

Mandalay Place has a complimentary parking structure.  Complimentary valet parking is also available."}
{"text":"Yogurt In... Overpriced and just ok.  

I've stopped here a few times when my sweet tooth takes control.  The service here is underwhelming.  I can't say it's bad but just not great.  

There are plenty of flavors to choose from as far as yogurt. The toppings are the usual to pick from to make your creation. There is just something about their yogurt that doesn't taste as good as other yogurt places.  

If you have a moment of weakness, then by all means this will do the trick.  I wouldn't go out of your way for their frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"The yogurt that I tasted at Yogurt In was okay. In all honesty, it is probably overpriced because you're on the strip and there is not much else to expect.

Service, on the other hand, was extremely slow and seemed like they didn't want to be there. It was hard to even get a sample!

2 yogurt cups will cost you $10-$13"}
{"text":"Terrible quality of frozen yogurt. When I pulled the yogurt out the dispenser, it was already melted. I asked the employees if this was normal and they said yes. I would NOT recommend to my friends or family"}
{"text":"I needed a sweet fix after lunch, and Yogurt In was cheap and across the corridor.  However, flavor selection is limited, flavors aren't all that great, and it was too icy for my preference.  I had the dulce de leche and cookies n' cream and didn't like either one.  Decent selection of toppings.  Staff was friendly though, but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"slow service, yogurt taste a bit like powder and was gritty ( Banana-strawberry), but the mango yogurt was delicious"}
{"text":"Over price, yogurt taste stall and the staff and owners are horrid. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"Crepe contains both rotten and un-ripe fruit. Pick your choice.   There is a layer of mucus membrane that coats the inner layer of the crepe.  Make sure to get the yogurt to act as a buffer for the sourness of the fruit. Try not to feel guilty tossing out 2/3 of the order."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of self-serve yogurt places. In fact, it has become our go-to dessert for our family.

This one was not impressive at all. It is more expensive than many others (although maybe not so much for the Strip). And the selection, particularly for the toppings, was not very good.

You don't have a lot of other options this far down on the Strip, so it is okay from that perspective. However, if you don't mind walking, consider finding another location."}
{"text":"Frozen yogurt sounded good after going to a concert at the House Of Blues right next door. This place is a self serve frozen yogurt joint, just like any other place. You grab your own yogurt and toppings, then pay at the end of the line. We had asked for mini sample cups and the lady didnt give us any. She said that she had to make the samples for us. Did she not trust us to get our own samples?? I had only asked for 2 samples because I felt it was too much of a pain to ask for more. Our 2 cups had barely any yogurt/toppings in it, and it came out to $10 and some change. Talk about Strip prices.....yogurt was just mediocre. Even Pinkberry on the Strip doesn't cost this much...and is way better."}
{"text":"I stayed at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas over the weekend for March Madness.  I wasn't going to walk or take a taxi just to get some frozen yogurt, so I tried this place out. 

The yogurt itself wasn't bad.  Nothing too different from the other self-serve frozen yogurt joints.  I was actually surprised they had as many flavors as they did.  I wasn't expecting much from a yogurt place in Las Vegas.  The different choices of toppings were also pretty much the same but they weren't crushed into small pieces like I'm used to.  The cookies and chocolate bars were served in huge chunks.  I prefer then crushed.

If I remember correctly, it was 49 cents per ounce which is more than I'm used to but not unexpected since I was getting yogurt inside a hotel in Vegas.

Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"The best thing is the cone bowl you can get with yogurt.  Their yogurt is not great.  Yogurtland or Menchies tastes better.  

Service is good though."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a crepe for breakfast this morning and it was delicious!  They are actually huge and quite filling - I probably only ate half of it.  They take a little while to make, but I felt it was worth the wait for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Crepe Milan. It took a while to make, but I was in no hurry.

The consistency of the crepe was too soft, and was very difficult to eat as a result. It would fall apart before reaching my mouth... every... single... time. My coworkers laughed at my plight. It was like trying to have soup with fork.

Shame.... I love Crepes. I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"We had crepes here for breakfast on vacation. The crepes were delicious but took a long time as only one person was cooking. The seating is food court-like do not commensurate with the prices."}
{"text":"Most of the flavors were out when we went.  Staff was busy talking with each other.  The vanilla and mango were good, considering those were our only options."}
{"text":"Lots of self serve yogurt flavors (49 cents per ounce, which is the Vegas strip premium). I also tried the nutella and banana crepe. You could see them being made right there. Also they had a friendly gentleman as a 'greeter' who made sure people knew what to do and explained everything. 

Overall - decent desert crepe, but expensive ($9) and good choices for yogurt but you are paying the premium of not leaving the hotel or strip."}
{"text":"During a stay at Mandalay Bay, we got yogurt and a crepe here.  I ordered the caramel apple crepe and it WAS NOT what I expected.  I thought I was going to get real apples with caramel and instead, it was APPLESAUCE inside a crepe with caramel drizzled on top.  Not at all what I would have ordered if I would have known.  A very expensive applesauce might I add.  I would not eat here again.  Ever."}
{"text":"Went here tonight to get some yogurt. I asked for a sample cup and was tossed around from employee to employee. I completely understand that they have to do it for you. The \"manager\" basically said he didn't have time for me.. mind you the girl who was making crepes told me to go ask him and he will help me. I stood waiting for her to help, I was waiting patiently and was completely nice because I understood that it was busy and I could wait if I wanted to try something. She finished making the crepes, another person asks her for a sample, not only does she not acknowledge me that I am still waiting for her, she helps the other people and never offered a sample. At this point I just grabbed something hoping I would like it and went to the cashier. I paid in cash and the \"manager\" didn't give me the correct change, I asked him I could please have my change, with attitude he slid the change across the counter. Absolute horrible customer service and made me feel as if I was a burden upon them. There should definitely be some sort of evaluation on this place."}
{"text":"Had the Nutella, strawberry, and bananas crepe. It was actually good enough for me to come back two nights later and have another one.  If you're looking for a dessert or snack this might be the place."}
{"text":"Decent little yogurt and crepes shop just outside of House of Blues/Mandalay Casino as you go into the shops.  

Tons of flavors to choose from, from the plain (chocolate) to the slightly more indulgent (cheesecake).  They also have a self service bar of toppings with everything from fresh fruit to crushed up candy bars.  Sort of a do it yourself Pinkberry. 

I liked it, it does get really backed up since it is self service and you can stand there with your cup for awhile while the people in front of you take a year to pick toppings!  

Price is in line with the Vegas strip - so expensive for what it is - but it is fro yo in a casino I didn't expect it to be cheap.  It was fun.  Wanted to try the crepes, but never got a chance - they looked and smelled wonderful!"}
{"text":"I hate being a hater.  My first approach is to always resolve an issue with management before reverting to Yelp and the credit card co. to dispute a transaction.  This time, unfortunately, I must go all the way and bash the business.  My family and I bought a yogurt (self-serve, no brainer) and a crepe here.  Simple transaction.  I ordered a cinnamon / sugar crepe, probably the most basic of crepes in the world of creperies.  

Short story shorter: they ran out of butter for the crepe, tried to pass off Crisco in a spray can as \"butter\" and wouldn't give me a refund when I didn't want that."}
{"text":"I've had better crepes in hotel Paris. There was 4 of us, and 3 out of 4 orders were missed. After about 15 minutes of waiting and realizing that they are passed our number we inquired about our order. The lady looked at me like I had four legs and three eyes. No apologies, nothing. Instead they had very bad attitude. The order was smashed on my plate and literary thrown at me. I wonder how they last in such great hotel. Truly a terrible experience on the morning of your first day in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was great, the yogurt was crap. I had vanilla, my girlfriend had the cheesecake yogurt, chocolate, peanut butter and coconut. Best one was peanut butter, but the texture was nasty. The cheesecake yogurt was sour and tasted like it was going bad. We both got stomach aches from it. We just tasted it, luckily we didn't eat it all or we would of spent the rest of our trip on the shitter in our room."}
{"text":"Stopped by here during my stay at Mandalay Bay for a quick sweet tooth fix. I'm partial to Pinkberry, but their self-serve yogurt selection did the job.

My only complaint about this place was more about some poor execution by the staff.. I was extremely excited for nutella/strawberry crepe (which I had to-go). The girl who made it put a mountain of whipped creme next to the piping hot crepe and by the time I got back to my room, it had melted, soaking/ruining the entire crepe. 11 bucks down the drain!"}
{"text":"Bleh!  Worst frozen yogurt ever.  All chemicals and water.  In fact, the worst I have ever had.

I tried two flavors: vanilla and chocolate.  You can always tell really bad frozen yogurt from good frozen yogurt.  Good frozen yogurt will be completely white and made from real milk.  Bad frozen yogurt almost has a cum like color to it.  Off white and you can see through it.  Oh, and It's served at this place.  Basically powder that's mixed with water.

I decided to have my usual: oreos with nuts and chocolate sauce.  I thought it was ok right up until my husband said, \"That is the most foul smelling yogurt I have ever smelled.\"  He was right.  At $10 bucks a cup, I felt obligated to eat all of it.  And it made me sick.

I give them an extra star because they serve crepes that are pretty good and very close if you're staying at Mandalay.  Slightly expensive but worth it since there are no crepes in close proximity.  Unless you want to walk.  Which I usually don't.  Because I always lose my money on the first day.  I end up doing the depression trudge the rest of the trip and punish myself with this chemical slop."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service. I decided to make a stop for some dessert while I waited on my friend and decided to try this place. I asked the young lady at the cash register if they had the little cups so I can try the flavor before I  put it in your cup and she looked at me up and down and said not right now.  Okay never mind then I won't be trying this place out."}
{"text":"I'm a harried conventioneer who is always on the march between Mandalay Convention Center and Luxor. This place provides a respectable deal and is a nice quiet refuge from the casino chaos. My experience with the service has been fine."}
{"text":"Bad service. Workers are constantly on their phones not paying attention to the customers."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for something light before going to see our show and we stumbled upon Yogurt In.  We filled up our cup with several flavors including coconut, mango, cheesecake and peanut butter.  Then we added all sorts of goodies to our yogurt and they even have Pina Colada Sobe!  

The yogurt was delicious...so rich and creamy.  We loved it.  They also serve crepes which looked fantastic.  Next time we will try one of those.  But of course all this yummy goodness comes at a price.  For one yogurt and a drink it came to almost $10.00.  But it's Las Vegas and everything costs more!"}
{"text":"The space between the frozen yogurt handles and the crepe station is limited. I enjoyed the Strawberry flavored frozen yogurt and Banana flavored frozen yogurt topped with multicolored mochi and frozen fruits (e.g., mango, kiwi, etc)."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. The price is not only out of control for the average froyo place, your serving will most likely cost you two times more than any other chain, BUT the service is horrible. The two workers there were BOTH on their cell phones the whole time my friend and I were there. NOT A CLASSY ENOUGH PLACE TO BE LOCATED IN MANDALAY BAY. Shame. If you want good froyo go to the place in the Galleria Mall in Henderson."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the flavors here ... or the consistency of the yogurt. The crepes were actually not bad ... I had the raspberry one and it was pretty good. But for a yogurt place the yogurt should definitely be better. 

On the plus side, it's open late ... so #win"}
{"text":"It's all right. It's definitely one of the cheaper ways to eat in Las Vegas. Ordered a nutella crepe with bananas. It was ok. Nothing special. It's in an MGM company building so there was free wi-fi too."}
{"text":"Yes. This place is expensive alright!!

Cost 49 cents an ounce is above average. Maybe they have high rent from Mandalay Bay, but they really got to work on their flavors and combinations. It's totally watery and mostly sour. The combinations doesn't go together. They have the creamy match with sorbet stuff. So when you do the mix the taste doesn't go well together. It seems like they are clueless on how to perfect their taste and selections. 

Off to the toppings... messy, no tags, can't tell what kinda toppings I want to top off my yogurt. 

Plus the cashier don't know how to count. Could use more training?!!"}
{"text":"Good yogurt ice cream but horrible service and not very experienced personnel. Quite expensive too."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  This yogurt spot is located inside the Monte Carlo so it had the convenient factor going for it for us.  We woke up and really wanted to try this spot since we passed by it the day prior while heading back from a late night outing.  We should have known though that the place wasn't going to be that good.  There were hardly any customers both times we went and that was two different times in the day.  

So anyways, the place is pretty overpriced for yogurt.  I'm actually not used to that but its Vegas so I gave them a pass.  Its understandable.  The yogurt actually doesn't taste bad either, its consistent with what we've had before.  The thing that isn't good is the toppings.  The brownie bits were all stale and bitter tasting, the fruits were not up to par and the other toppings just looked bleh.  Customer service was ok too.  

Overall its a spot you might want to skip if you're in Vegas.  There are just better options in town but if you're really dying to try some yogurt here then I suggest skipping out on the toppings.  Just go with the sauce and yogurt and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Great customer services they are very friendly. Delicious frozen yogurt!!! Can not wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets low reviews for their yogurt.  I came here specifically for their crepes and specifically for the savory crepes, the pepperoni and cheese and the ham and cheese.  At about $9.50 they're a bit expensive, but they do provide a good portion.  I was expecting smaller portions.  I had two and was completely full.  The largest crepe I ever had was from a Middle Eastern vendor in Paris and only one filled with ground beef did the job to fill me up for the day.  So just saying, a single crepe here can do the job of filling you up for dinner.  The ham was all tiny diced up and tasteless but the cheese made up for it.  Can't say anything about the yogurt, but it was a decent creperie, kind of like the Subway of crepes, not exactly gourmet crepes."}
{"text":"The pistachio yogurt is the go to for my wife and I! Keep it simple and just a few toppings but the flavor for the pistachio is delicious! Little on the pricey side...but it's Vegas so that was expected."}
{"text":"3 may be generous...I had arrived in Vegas and my guard was down because I was hannnngryy! Oh no, froyo. Must resist. Can't resist. 

 Froyo for lunch? #Adulting

Quality: Now, this is certainly NOT even close to the best froyo I've ever had, especially in texture.

Samples: I was surprised when I asked for sample cups they actually had them. Of course, considering this is Vegas where anything can happen, they required the worker to get my sample.

Flavors: Lots of machines. Decent flavors with some of my faves - no sugar cheesecake (I'm a sucker), cake batter, hazelnut (apparently gelato texture.....), peanut buttah (to my jelly)

Toppings: Decent. Fresh fruit (didn't get it because hello, heavy), choco covered marshies, and your other typical candies and froyo toppings

Price: 59 cents an ounce! Holy overpriced smokes! I don't usually really take notice of typical froyo pricing, but miniscule portion came out to almost $4 for six ounces. Not to mention, my suspicion that something fishy was going on with their scale. 

In summary, don't blame me, I was weak!"}
{"text":"As we were walking around Mandalay we were hungry for some breakfast and we needed to grab something quick. We came along to this nice shop that sold yogurt which is self service and pay by the weight of your item. I noticed they also sell crepes which i was in the mood for.

Thinking that it was just mediocre crepes, i decided to order the breakfast savory crepes while my friend gets the tuna cheese crepe. I also underestimated the portions of the crepes thinking it'd be just a snack, it actually filled me up! And its pretty decently priced considering it was  inside the hotel.

All in all it was a decent crepe that I've haven't had in ages. Would go back if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Blech.

Yogurtland wanna-be.  And not a very good one at all.

Too sweet.  Kind of chalky too.

Sorrry, Yogurt In.

I'm Out.

;'/"}
{"text":"Frozen yogurt sounded delicious after chilling at the beach in Mandalay! The frozen yogurt was a little more on the liquidy side. 

You can ask for samples but weirdly enough, the worker came out and poured the sample for me. Unusual for this style of frozen yogurt, but I guess it's protocol!

I ordered the omelet and was not a fan. Probably not a spot where I would order food from again.."}
{"text":"I wanted a crepe for breakfast because I'd been walking past this place for a few days and it drew me in.  Unfortunately, the choice I made was not very good.  The crepe seemed to be a bit tasteless and rubbery, and there was way to much chocolate on it.  I should have went with a berry one to mellow out the chocolate a bit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some yogurt with my son. This literally has to be the worst frozen yogurt I have ever had. I had cookies and cream and he had vanilla. We both took one bite and threw the rest away. It had no taste. Don't  waste your money."}
{"text":"We went for the crepe and a waffle this morning and we were not disappointed. I was surprised at the other reviews and can only hope that reading them got the management to make some service changes. The girl behind the counter was attentive, quick to help and even watched our stuff while I paid (there's no seating except across a high traffic halfway.) 
The \"original\" crepe was delicious according to my wife especially with the addition of some strawberries. My waffle was light and fluffy and it was nice to be able to pick whatever toppings I wanted to put on it (they charge by weight.) 
Now I know these were a little on the pricey side, but in relation to the rest of Vegas is about what you'd expect. It surprised me that other reviews didn't put the prices in context."}
{"text":"I had the best fruit crepe of my life there!!!  Tons of fruit, cooked to perfection.  Little pricy but hey what do you expect, it is Vegas!!  Will be back next time I am in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"If there was an option to choose zero stars, that's what I would choose.   Terrible customer service.  Starting with the female employee to the shift manager these people were horrible.   Top management needs to keep an eye on these people or fire them and get someone else that will make a difference in there business.  The yogurt is not good and overpriced.   And in all honesty who cares about the price when your in Vegas,  attitude of the employees was the killer.  I'm not promoting any other vendor, but yogurtland should replace this place.  In the mood for sweets don't go there find another place.  They are rude and the yogurt sucks. ZERO STARS ......"}
{"text":"Pretty similar to all the self serve fro'yo places around SoCal, except this one is inside the Mandalay Bay, right outside the House of Blues.

.49 cents per oz.--- more than normal, but you are on the strip.

They also have fresh-made crepes. All kinds from breakfast and lunch to dessert flavors.
I tried two dessert crepes while I was in Vegas.
The Sweet Crepes Paris with apples, carmel and nuts and the Chocolate Mousse crepe.
$8.99 each.
Both were really good... hot and fresh.... made while you watch.
This is a great place to grab a quick and easy dessert in the middle of Mandalay Bay.

You can also grab a bottled water or fountain drink here for $2.75 which seems pretty reasonable for \"Vegas pricing\"."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with yogurt especially when you can add your own toppings and go crazy. 

Love the flavored will be going back to try before this trip is over"}
{"text":"This yogurt place makes good crepes!  

While staying at the Aria, I had a create-your-own savory crepe here, with smoked salmon, mozzarella cheese, diced tomatoes and eggs, and oh gawd....that crepe was super yummy!  Portion was huge, and price was only $9.99 plus tax!  This salmon and egg crepe was even tastier than the crepes that I had at my all-time-favorite \"La Creperie\" inside the Paris Hotel.  One more thing, service was friendly and prompt. 

Yogurt In is now my \"must-go\" crepe shop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Now they serve mini cupcakes and while they look darn cute, and are a decent price, they lacked flavor and were a bit dry.  At $6+ for 4, you can decide for yourself.   Me? I'll stick to the nutella crepe."}
{"text":"I consult Yelp a lot whenever looking for new places to check out. I LOVE the extra detailed reviews so you can get an idea of what the place was really about but I also have to get a good chuckle out of the people that leave one-line reviews with very little detail. In the case of Yogurt In, I'm half tempted to do it.

My one-line Yogurt In review:

Ick. I had the pomegranate sorbet and it made my teeth hurt. I'm not a fan.

Although, I take my Yelping too seriously and could never leave a review under 100 characters, I stand by the review. First off, it's in a hotel so you know it's even more costly than the already overpriceyness (oh yeah, I make words up for Yelp reviews) of the whole FroYo industry. I knew that getting into it, but still wanted some dang dessert.

I went for the cheesecake froyo and some pomegranate sorbet cause it looked awesome. Cheesecake froyo is what I usually order back home and it was okay. Not as good as others but I didn't hate it. The problem was that I put the cheesecake on bottom and the pomegranate on top so I was plagued by that pomegranate garbage through the whole cup.  It was just terrible. 

If you check this place out, I'd recommend a crepe or a mini cupcake. They can't possibly be as gross as the sorbet."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in for a quick treat before a concert at the House of Blues since it is located right next door. 59 cents an ounce is the going price for their sugary and processed frozen yogurt. I might have loved this stuff before, but now that I have weaned myself off this style of froyo, it is hard to stomach. I tried a little bit of their blueberry-acai, lemon, and mango sorbet. When the lemon mixed with any of the other flavors, it gave it an off taste. Normally I would say that citrus would only improve any fruit base, but I was horribly wrong. It does not help that their fruit looked old and half of it came from cans."}
{"text":"The yogurts ice cream is ok, but didn't like the cinnamon pretzel, too dry, the didnt even have anythibg to dip them to make them less dry."}
{"text":"I'm dying for yogurt so we're in Mandalay Bay trying their yogurt. Don't try the original tart & mango.  Tastes like medicine.
As for cleanliness not to fond of the self serve.  I see tourist coughing covering their mouths then touching the handles to get  the yogurt - not a good idea for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Heck no. Not only is place extremely expensive, the food sucks.

7$ for a the world's smallest sandwich? No.
10$ for a tasteless crepe? Meh.
A night of food poisoning? Priceless.

I got the Breakfast crepe which had mushrooms, cheese and eggs in it. I have no fricken idea what exactly decided to attack my body in a medieval slaying GOT style, but whatever it was, I feel half dead.

They can get away with charging laughable prices because they know that once the other, better restaurants in the Mandalay fill up, hungry people will have no choice but to go to them, or brave the strip. Which is what happened to us, but we had to be at a show at 9pm, and were pretty hungry. Bad idea. Bad, bad, bad idea. If I shall die tonight, at least I can say I tried to be a good Yelper in trying new places."}
{"text":"Out of the different places at Mandalay I was a bit surprised, pleasantly, at Yogurt In and Crepes.  The nice thing about this place compared to many of the other places in the Mandalay is that it is fast and reasonably priced.

Grabbed a quick lunch with a savory crepe.  The hungarian crepe had several cheeses, spinach, and mushrooms wrapped in a nice crepe.  This was a substantial crepe as far as thickness of the crepe, which seemed to fit with the savory type.  The spinach was a nice par-boiled so not too crunchy but not soggy either.

The cheese mix was a  nice touch with average mushrooms.  Fresh mushrooms would have been nicer.

Hopefully their sweet dessert crepes are a bit thinner and lighter, if not it would not be a good match.

There has been some back and forth listed here regarding their yogurt, which I did not have the chance to sample.  But for a quick lunch the savory crepes are A-Ok and reasonably priced for a casino based eatery."}
{"text":"It was ok. Just ok. Crepes looked good. You can't sample on your own and need to wait for the employee to fill you a sample cup. Problem is she was super distracted and had me waiting so long I almost walked out. 
I've never seen anyone quite like her actually. 
1st she told me I can have only 2 samples . I said ok... I told her which ones. She gave me one and turned her back to me and asked the next person if they wanted any samples. I didn't mind that... But I did mind when she started a LONG convo with the couple, and I was standing there waiting. Had to come all the way around so that I could have her see me again (the  crepe station is in the center of the shop and the room is round and her back was facing me, it was either that or tapping her shoulder from her back). Finally the woman's husband she was talking to pointed out that I needed assistance. She filled my second flavor and I filled my cup. I just wanted to pay and leave and now she comes up to the cashier and starts a convo with her! Really?!?  (like she couldn't wait 1 min for me to pay and leave, nobody was behind me and the other couple had left) good thing cashier was focused and took care of me before they wasted any more of my time. 

Sad thing is, I'm sure she doesn't even realize what she did."}
{"text":"Great food when you don't want to over-stuff yourself. Fun for kids and everyone. Offers savory and sweet crepes, as well as frozen yogurts of multiple flavors, and self combine parfait.

Open till late. Very decently priced compared to Strip prices ($8-$10 for a yummy crepe)."}
{"text":"First off, I was standing at the counter, and the girl making crepes didn't bother to acknowledge or greet me or ask if I needed help with anything. 

Second, the crepes are way overpriced. I ordered a \"Special\" savory crepe, if I remember correctly is $9.99. You can choose ONLY 4 ingredients, and if you want to add a protein it's an additional $1. One of the ingredients I chose was spinach, and chicken for protein. While she was making my crepe I noticed how VERY little spinach she added, more like a garnish amount, and the chicken is cut into little cubes. I barely had any spinach or chicken in my crepe and too much cheese:( I payed almost $12, so disappointing. Not worth it.

 I would recommend going to Tasty Crepes on S. Fort Apache. Their savory crepes are about $7 and you can choose to add all ingredients and the crepes are much larger."}
{"text":"After a day of running around the Strip and heading back to our room, we walked by the Yogurt In. You walk in and it's basically a wall of different flavors of Yogurt. The give you a cup and you just get to wander and mix and match to your heart's content. After picking your flavor you get to pick and choose from about 20 or so different toppings like cherries, strawberries, snickers, etc.

They charge by the ounce (.49 cents) so it can add up quick, but everything was so  yummy so who cares??"}
{"text":"I did not get a chance to try their yogurt, but I do have to say - - their crepes are some of the best I've ever had! Belgian mousse crepe, Nutella crepe as well as Mediterranean crepe - all were mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"$14 for a cup of yogurt."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with this place. 
1) Overpriced
2) You know the little cups that you use at any other yoghurt place? Forget about those here. I requested a few and the guy came to give me to try two floors with an attitude.
3) Most of their flavors are actually flavorless
4) Most of their flavors are not cold enough and come out pretty soft (diarrhea looking if we talk about salt caramel, cookies and cream or chocolate).
5) I didn't try their crepes and I won't try them"}
{"text":"By far the worst yogurt experience I have ever had. The flavors all pretty much tasted the same, which is watery and bland. They have good mix-ins, but that far from makes up for the yogurt, which should be the highlight, not the disappointment. 

The staff were not very helpful, either. We were thinking of getting crepes, too, but no one was in the crepe center, and even upon looking around no one asked if we needed help. 

I could comment on their prices, but the only way they could make your purchase worth it is if they were giving it away for free."}
{"text":"Just a review for the frozen yogurt section. Everything was good, and the toppings were adequate. There could've been a little more variety but the fruit was fresh and the service was quick."}
{"text":"After visiting Yogurtland at Town Square, I excitedly filled up a cup at Yogurt In located in The Shoppes at Mandalay Place. While this frozen yogurt not bad, it was definitely not Yogurtland! The texture was how it should be, but the flavor was less creamy and more artificial tasting. I tried Coconut and Peanut Butter with Toasted Coconut and Butterfinger toppings. The Coconut fro-yo was OK, but the Peanut Butter fro-yo had a slight sour tang, weird. The Butterfinger topping was very chunky, as were all the chocolate bars and cookies as Andy I states. I didn't order any these, but Yogurt In also serves made to order Crepes filled with various fillings. I might try a Crepe next time I'm in Vegas, but I hope they're better than the frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of flavors and seems to change regularly.  I have tried over 10 different flavors, and I have never been disappointed.  It is also a great place to go for a cool snack when the outside temperature is 100 degrees or more."}
