{"text":"Best pizza! Very convenient from the house. The menu is great. Chicken fingers, chef salad, pizza and a pitcher of beer. We hit this place at least a couple times a month. 
Only suggestion would be to add a few more beer on draft selections than just bud light."}
{"text":"My go to spot when I don't want to cook but want 'real' food. Their pizza is awesome - the crust is just right. We love their subs too. They fill up our biggest eaters. The help is always personable.  Its like going to your neighbors' house for dinner."}
{"text":"We go to this establishment at least once a week, the family gets different items, me, I ALWAYS get a calzone.  The service is always friendly, the prices are good, and the food is GREAT!  We have pretty much decided this is our place of choice for the weekly Italian get away."}
{"text":"so i used to love this place because i was always able to call ahead and have pizza waiting when we got there. but yesterday I was told \"oh we don't do that anymore it turned into to too much of a Hassle\" i have ordered pizza ahead many times because they are right next to the cinedome movie theater where we want to eat before we go the movie so last night, instead of our pizza movie night it turned into 7 11 hot dogs and bottle soda night. very disappointed guess i will have to find a new place to eat before the movie :("}
{"text":"I had a chef's salad. It was as basic as it gets, everything was cut in large pieces making it difficult to eat. Plenty of iceberg lettuce but pretty stingy with the rest; half a tomato, a few spinach leaves and a few small pieces of ham, turkey and provolone. The blue cheese dressing was good with chunks of actual cheese. Cafeteria environment short on any ambiance."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMMM!! Eat here, be fat and be happy!  Planning on taking my nephews here at least once a month as a treat!"}
{"text":"If there was an option to give 0 stars I would have. I have been a loyal customer of Sunset Pizza since they opened. Tonight all I ordered was there takeout special cheese pizza and I think they didn't put forth the effort that they normally do because I just ordered the \"cheap\"  special. I received a large cheese pizza with no sauce, just cheese and pizza crust. You just lost a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great.  The ranch dressing for the wings incredible.  The ranch for the salad gross.  Not sure but they have a watered down ranch for the salad.  We have had other food from here like the afredo and pesto but they weren't great.  The pizza and wings are great.  Service is good."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing,  with me being from New York and all, when I walk in to pizza shops out here on the west coast my expectations aren't to high,   I'll usually order wraps or sandwiches, but when I saw this pizza sitting in the window, I just had to try it,   Hands down one of the best slices I've had in the year I've lived here in Nevada,     Thank you for bringing me back to a good slice of pizza"}
{"text":"Good pizza, fast cook time, no table service.

I ordered a large pizza and it arrived at my table in less than 15 minutes. Aside from delivering the food to your table, there appears to be no table service to speak of: you go to the counter and order more beers, etc.

The pizza itself was hot and tasty. The crust is thin (I heard someone call it New York style, but I don't agree: isn't NY style supposed to be ultra thin?). Ingredients were good quality but not great.

The atmosphere is a typical local-owned, family oriented restaurant; decent. Decore is minimal and simple plenty of with neon beer signs.

I paid $21.38 for as large pizza and fountain drink..

Recommended. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Me and my family have been coming here for 3 years and love love love this place. Always good food and the service is always fantastic. Every now and then we come on a Sunday and they mess up our order but I can let that go because that does happen from time to time but we know when certain people are there it does not happen. 
We typically eat in and probably twice per month order delivery. Food is great every time! My only complaint is they need a larger dining area because they can get very busy :)"}
{"text":"This is a yummy, adorable lil' pizza place that has so much more than just pizza! Everything from NY style pizza to Gyros to subs! The prices are reasonable, the staff is super nice, restaurant is clean, food is always hot and tasty, and they deliver til ten pm and go as far as Russell and Boulder. They are right next to the Cinadome 12 and within walking distance from old henderson so the location is nice as well!"}
{"text":"OK there are Not many places that offer Pizza by the slice like Sunset Pizza. However there is nothing spectacular about the Taste. Cheap and cheerful.  Meaning... for a quick bite, that wont hit your pocket book, its ok."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Fries and onion rings were soggy. Service could have been better. It took longer than they originally quoted because order volume was high. May give another chance down the road. Overall - Meh..."}
{"text":"Love their chese pizza and wings and fingers alway good food and always great service good deals on specials"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Sunset Pizzeria many times because it was close to where I used to work and I enjoyed the speed and the the convenience.  Sadly they, like many other pizzerias, insist on serving you pizza drenched in oils.  I'm tired of seeing pools of thick yellow grease in the pizza pan when I am finished."}
{"text":"Their food is good but the customer service is terrible. There's always a way to fix it and make a weekly customer stay loyal.  I'm a manager at a business also and we wouldn't make money if it wasn't for our customers. We normally pick up since they are very busy. Two times there was a huge prob and neither time, Gustavo, the manager, did anything except say we should \"try the one on water street.\" Apparently they are not as busy. Even when they weren't busy I waited for a pick up and the food sat there for about 20 minutes longer. Maybe the owners should \"try a new manager.\""}
{"text":"This place was garbage. I went in for my first (and only!) time the other day. I ordered 5 chicken fingers with fries for my young child and I. I anxiously watched as large groups who came in after me were served their food. Over 15 minutes go by and Gus (the cashier) had forgotten my order as it sat on a shelf getting cold. He offered a muffled apology when I confronted him about my missing order. They didn't offer to refund or replace it with a hot meal. Terrible customer service. The food was sub par at best. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"They first did not want to correct my order after asking them to add vegetables to my pizza, I paid for them of course. They also did not seem to be very friendly and attentive. A person ordered after me and got her pizza before me. I had to wait 10 more minutes to get mine. Needless to say this was the first time here and definitely the last."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating I really enjoy the food here. I have been here for lunch, ordered out, and sat down for dinner and never had an issue with the food. I prefer their pizza over most places.  However, SERVICE MEANS A LOT. 

I have had terrible service there once in person to the point where my boyfriend wanted to walk out. Well last night I called in on my way out of work from a 12 hour shift.  I did not have much brain power left and wanted to just grab food and go home. Lets just say my phone call was very unpleasant.  I asked for pizza and ranch where the person on the phone proceeded to ask how much ranch I would like \"2 pints, half a pint, blah blah blah.\" At this point in the day I do not have much left in my brain and was not thinking measurements I just wanted ranch. I said a cup would be fine where he proceeded to tell me \"well I do not know what that means\" and continued to repeat himself over \"2 pints, half a pint blah blah blah\" 

I then decided I would let him know I was displeased with his phone etiquette seeing he repeated himself three times when I just wanted a small container of ranch. He could have simply said \"I will show you sizes when you pick up\" or something rather than repeating himself over when I obviously didn't understand.  When I approached him in the store he was nothing short of rude. He denied being rude and the manager stood and listened to my conversation and did not care to interject and say I am sorry for your unpleasant phone call. I paid and went to walk out and got the ever popular \"have a good night!\" 

I believe I work very hard and I am pleasant to every person I come in contact with. These people are rude and unpleasant. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Love the food here! But definitely not professional when someone calls to order and the employees answer \"HELLO\" instead of \" Thank you for calling susnset pizzeria\" my immediate response was \" Is this sunset puzzeria????\"..  Night staff needs to get trained on how to answer phones!"}
{"text":"The absolute WORST food from a pizza place that I've had in Henderson. I've only had delivery from them, so in house may be different, but I highly doubt it. Because they're terrible. 

In the past I have ordered a pepperoni pizza and plain chicken tenders, and while the tenders were \"meh\", the pizza was OK. 

This time we ordered a \"The Greek\" pizza, which was extremely disappointing. It sounds much more delicious than it actually is, and looks very unappetizing. We ate a couple slices and then threw the rest away. 

The real nightmare was the chicken tenders. I ordered chicken tenders, \"hot\"  style with extra ranch, with CRISPY fries. I reiterated several times that the fries should be crispy, or \"well done\". 

This was misinterpreted as \"I want a literal half pint of awful ranch flavored water with my disgusting microwaved chicken, with a side of gross soggy potato strings.\" 

I will NEVER waste my money on this awful restaurant EVER again. 

I tipped the delivery guy extremely well, because I understand the plight of the service industry employee, but I would highly recommend AGAINST ever ordering delivery from this place. Seriously. Just awful."}
{"text":"BEWARE: FOOD POISONING 

 I was craving Italian food all day, and trying to figure out a place to eat I finally decided upon Sunset Pizzeria. Of course, I should have ordered pizza instead of pasta at a pizza parlor, but regardless I awoke around 10 hours later at about 4:30am running to my toilet and continuing to throw up in the most miserable few minutes of my life, body broke out into a sweat, and 5 minutes later I'm back in bed. I awoke the next morning still feeling horrible the entire day, that I decide to take the food back to them and demand my money back as I do not pay for food that makes me sick! 

  I have not been sick since I was younger, and I am a light eater, and I literally did not eat anything the entire day except for a bagel in the morning which I always eat.. Naturally when I was throwing up the bagel was long past, and it was only my spaghetti. 

 Coming back to the place the owner happened to be there, and he tells me that his wife is a nurse and that it takes at least 24 hours to get food poisoning. I can tell you for a fact that is wrong, and this guy is ignorant. People can get food poisoning hours after eating it...Plus, I have a very fast metabolism, and my body processes things faster than normal.. 10 hours is plenty of time for food poisoning to set in. Naturally we get in a shouting match, and there are only about 7-8 people in the restaurant mostly employees and I wish I would of made a video of how bad he looked. I guess he is struggling or times are rough. I suspect that possibly the cook may have done something as well, but I cannot be sure... I am vegetarian, and asked what didn't have meat, and the cook wasn't even sure when asking the hostess over the phone, and it seemed like he was just a hater on vegetarians or something.  

  I WILL NEVER GO BACK, AND TELL EVERYONE I KNOW HOW HORRIBLE OF AN EXPERIENCE I HAD.

  I still taste the Alfredo sauce in my throat with a mix of bile/th**w up. Absolutely disgusting, I've been sick all day like I said. BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"We order out a couple times a week. My notes on Sunset Pizzeria show that we have ordered delivery from them six times. Pizzas came hot and tasty but, wife would have liked it cooked a little more she likes the bottom crust crunchy. She orders a large (16\") with pepperoni. The pizza came with no extra flood of oil all over. The sauce was tasty with a spice twinge and the cheese was melted deep. Pepperoni was hat and snappy for what was a great pie.

I had eggplant bake and a chicken bake. Both hot with a very nice marinara and good stringy cheese with it's own flavor. Nice pieces of fried eggplant and some very moist chicken for the other meal.We ordered a Chef Salad to split. The meats were rolled and cut as pinwheels. There was a lot of cold cuts rolled on this salad. Our salad was also mixed with black olive sliced, some pepperoncini, some red onion, nice tomato wedges, a hard boiled egg sliced in half, and a generous amount of lettuce that was torn in good sized pieces. They suggested their own italian dressing that I found flavorful but, a little acrid. The \"Boys\" split an order of spaghetti with meatballs (2). Great marinara and a couple very large dense and well cooked meatballs. The pasta was well cooked for my taste I'm not a fan of real la dente. The portion fed the two boys and made their eyes roll. It filled them both up. We were supplied with plane crunchy bread and a small loaf of garlic bread that i managed to devour by myself.

All this was delivered in an hour hat and ready to eat. The delivery guy was very pleasant, helpful, and provided us with suggestions for our next order. 

I doubt that Sunset Pizzeria will go without at least one order a week from us \"Stay at Homers\". On the weekends we go out and during we order out a lot. You like Italian style food, You like Pizza, you like Stromboli???
Give the SUNSET PIZZERIA a try. You'll be going back again. See what you get for the price. You can't pass this up."}
{"text":"I called and the lady that answered says \"sunset pizzaria can i put you on hold\" but put me on hold right away i didnt even get a chance to say anything, then she picked up the phone after 6 mins her name is Brittney and she was so abrupt and so quick about taking my order for delivery it was 6:59 when we finally end up, she said it will be about an hour. But it did not get to us after an hour 30 mins. The food was Awsome but the lady that took our order was rude!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time I have enjoyed pizza from Sunset Pizzeria. I waited to after this last time to post my review just in-case the first time was a fluke. I don't give out 5-stars very easily especially since I am a Pizza Snob. Anyway, now I am now a fan. 

The thing that stuck me was lack of grease the pepperoni had. Usually when you order a pepperoni pizza, there is a huge grease puddle at the bottom of the box. Don't get me wrong, I used to love my pizza like I loved my women, hot, fresh, and a little greasy! Now that I am older and have more common sense, I still like hot and fresh pizza, but I can do without the heart-attack juice."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill fast. I had delivery here the other night and the driver was rude. I went in today to do a pick up order and the guy at the front counter was rude. I asked for a pizza with pepperoni and then said- actually \"just half pepperoni\"- and the guy lets out a big huff. I asked him \"did I do something to upset you\"? He just shrugged. I asked for a manger and he said he was the manager. Never doing business here again and I'll tell everyone I know. A shame too- I've been ordering from here for over 10 years at least once a week."}
{"text":"The wings are so homb very crispy and meaty. The pizza was delicious too but I preferred the Buffalo wings. They have a good deal we got a pizza with 20 wings for under $30. We were very satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Quick service any time I call for pickup! When I'm in the mood for ny style pizza this is where I get a quick fix."}
{"text":"Wow, went back again and had the Antipasto salad....whoa! Amazing, the large is enough for 4 adults. Also had the Philly Cheese Steak, man this blows Phillies version out of the water!  I am so impressed. My friends had the hamburgers which were enormous and they said the smoked bacon on them was incredible. So nice to have a somewhat fast food restaurant with real plates and silverware. Very nice touch. Really our only minor complaint would be the napkins, very cheap and you end up using more of them. 
One other thing that was weird, at least for me was the old man ( I'm guessing the owner ) sitting in a corner just watching everything going on, feels a little mafia like, just weird. At least talk to customers to see if they're enjoying the food. Beyond that, I'm a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Horrible. No one came to greet us. We ordered and the girl at the counter had no customer service. I ordered a gyro and my friend ordered a meatball sub. His meatball sub was flovorless. No flavor to the meatballs or sauce. I ordered a gyro... what a joke. No tsatsiki sauce... they put mayo lettuce and tomatoes. It's a gyro not a sandwich.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is the best in town and you can tell the pizza is fresh. You get great costumer service and the staff is friendly. You also get to watch a good game of football. Once you are done you can watch a movie at the cinedome 12. If tou have not been here then you should get a large cheese pizza for  $10. I do think that you should come here."}
{"text":"We ordered this through eat24 online.  The menu looked appealing, but that was as far as the appeal went.

Delivery took the entire 60mins of the 45-60min delivery time, which they charged a $2 delivery fee for.  It didn't take long for the delivery man to ask for his cash tip, either.

We ordered a chicken and pizza philly cheese steak with an order of onion rings.  The order was thrown into a plain plastic bag with no structure.  This meant that the little plastic container with dressing(?I don't know what for exactly) had exploded and was all over the inside of the bag.

When we got to the food it was horrible.  The onion rings were fried in an oil that tasted like it hadn't been changed in a few years.  I'm not sure if they use real cheese on the phillys, but it doesn't taste good.  At first I thought that it was a philly made with thick mayo.  Nope, that's the \"cheese,\" you'll find out the hard way when you realize that it's cooled to be solid.

Not even the soda was good.  They need to have their lines cleaned, or their carbonation callibrated, the Diet Coke tasted like it had dirt in it.  The Coca-Cola Company would be sad their image is being smeared.

Don't waste your money, expect good service, or good food.  You'll have a better night if you heed my warnings."}
{"text":"The black haired old lady who worked behind the counter that took my order was rude & unfriendly. She didnt even ask us how our food was that we ordered. I got the feeling that she could care less about how she treats her customers. She brought one persons food and then brought the next persons food 10 mts later, though we were eating lunch together. She dropped the food onto the glass tableand still didnt say a word .This was the first time and probably the last time eating there. I would suggest trying durango pizza voted number 1 for pizza in las vegas review journal 2014."}
{"text":"Food was good, no complaints there at all. Dining room was absolutely filthy. Trash scattered all over the floor, dishes with stale food left on the tables, sticky table tops, etc."}
{"text":"Pizza pepperoni and pineapple) had absolutely no flavor! Worst pizza in the area! I will wait inline for Johnny Macs next time!!! Very expensive for horrible pizza dinner!!! Won't ever go back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, but 3 times I've asked for well done pizza, and the last 3 times it was so floppy the cheese slid off. I has to ask for sauce because the pizza was all cheese. The cheese was also so salty, low quality. You should need to drink a gallon of water after eating pizza.  Last summer I would of said it was the best, not any more. Going back to Metro. Great dough at Metro. I won't waste any more money at this location."}
{"text":"Went back today for lunch. I had the Chicago Italian Beef sandwich. It was fabulous. Had great flavor, crunchy bread. Came with fries and a drink. 
The sandwich was huge and more fries than one person needs to eat. 
I had half the sandwich and half the fries. Two people could definitely share this. All for 7.50. 
The lady who works there is so nice. Makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Ok NEVER coming here again, the service people are so rude holy cow. Ordered pizza told them I didn't want an ingredient on there people gets brought to table tell them it's wrong and didn't get a I'm sorry I got a I read the order back to you. The person on the register sits on her butt
And is just rude, she has got to be related to the owners because I cannot be the only one who has said this person is rude"}
{"text":"Do they have the BEST customer service? Not really but it's not as bad as the other reviews say it is. The cashier seemed distracted even though the place wasn't busy when we arrived but eh whatever. Anyway, I went in with the kids for the first time and ordered an extra large pepperoni pizza and 20pc medium wings. It was so delicious!!! Honestly, it's hard for me to find wings I really like but theirs are sooo good. I'll be coming back here often I'm sure!"}
{"text":"It has truly become a joke with my family and friends. I LOVE their Strombolis. I order the sausage Stromboli without onions but add olives every time we eat here. I have ordered it soooo many times. To go, delivery, and in house. EVERY single time, it is not right, for one reason or another. Until we came here about 2 weeks ago. It was right. Ending our months long anticipation of when I receive my order if it will be right. Kind of made us sad.  But here it is. The yummy Stromboli."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in townnn!!!!! I love the ranch, pizza, and All the employees are so sweet!!! Sarena always has a smile."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in Las Vegas! Although it's not just pizza, everything Italian, sandwiches, salads and pastas are all great. Service is excellent. It's comfortable and you feel like your home, small town feel and you always run into someone you know. I highly recommend you get a large to take home some leftovers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch after having passed it up about a thousand times.  Located inside an industrial complex, it would be easy to pass up if you weren't looking for it.

Went with two slices of the Sicilian and then tried a slice of the New York style. Not great, not horrible but a-ok. If I ever go back I would defiantly ask for \"well done, please.\"

Beware of the quarter just outside the door that you might tempt you to want to pick up.  It's cemented to the concrete and thus unobtainable unless you have a jackhammer."}
{"text":"Average in every way. Large salads but they're mostly lettuce.  The Gyro was nothing to rave about and was mostly onions and lettuce.  The pizza is mediocre and needs more flavor. The service is frequently slow.  It has a lot of potential as your local pizza spot but it just falls short.  As far as flavor the fast food pizza places are just as good."}
{"text":"We started going here when they first opened We really liked the food. The last time we went the pizza was not very good. Burnt and hardly any thing on it. Hopefully if we go again it will be better"}
{"text":"Best game day pizza! Their ranch is so tasty and so many pizza toppings to chose from!"}
{"text":"Never would have visited this delightful local pizza spot if it weren't for meeting up to watch the MNF game with 49er fans and Yelp friend Judd L and his sweet wife Lynn.

If you're a longtime local you'll remember this place as the former home of Villa Pizza ..but it's different owners and family run business now.  I appreciate the varied menu items they have to offer and the prices are great deals.

The staff is friendly didn't have too long of a wait for ordering or waiting for our food. The place is clean and the tables were always bused right away.

For some reason it's emphasized that there is no table service. I found ordering at the counter a lot more efficient anyways for this type of joint.  The dining area is open and airy. Plenty of seating both booths and tables for larger parties and/or sport teams. The interior deco has a homey feel with cool Americana knicknacs on the shelves and photos hanging on the walls. 
 
Tried their basic salad which was a pretty generous serving and perfect for a family of 4. Fresh,crisp and cold, that's good in my book. Spaghetti and Italian sausage was good too.  When dining w/hubby we got the Pizza/Wing deal which is perfect since I hardly have pizza when dining out.  I chose to have the wings and hubby had the pizza.  I took a bite from Mr. B's pizza, it's NY style, thin crisp crust, love the sauce! Tasted homemade, like they simmered the ingredients for a while.   My chicken wings obviously just came outta the fryer cause they were so hot. Wings were good, but not like my favorite garlic parm ones at another place. The homemade canoli here though was a really nice sweet treat!
    
Another big plus in my book was how family friendly this place is. The times I have been here the place was quite busy with families and sports teams coming and going, you get a sense the local neighborhood gathers here to watch sports on the TV too! So now be ready, it's going to be invaded with 49er fans! Woot!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas hands down and the best ranch!! 


We come here all the time!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME PIZZA!!! Had a large pepperoni & sausage last night, it was probably the best pizza I've had in Vegas in 10 years! No joke. Also it's a really cool, old school pizzaria. The kind of place that little league baseball teams go to which is exactly what was going on last night. Very charming and very family friendly. Pitchers of beer and soda. The locals sitting behind said everything is great and huge portions. We (wife and 3 kids) had 1 extra large pizza and couldn't finish it. Took 2 slices home. Great crust. High quality cheese and meats. Bummer it's located 20 miles from where I live, but we'll make the drive from Rhodes Ranch. Totally worth it. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We ordered delivery and a small portion of our order was missing so I called them back to let them know and was put on hold repeatedly. Finally after getting through, I asked for a refund which she said she would handle but ended up charging my card again. I now have a $65 charge and a $55 charge to my account. I called today asking why there were two charges and she said they made a mistake. The proper way to handle this would be to contact the customer immediately which they failed to do. She told me it will take up to 7 days to get my refund back on a mistake they did. Terrible customer service. I will not be ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"When they first opened I loved this place. Food was always good and prices were ok. Within the last year or two, the food has really gone down hill. Wings are always over cooked and dry. Same with the chicken fingers. Didn't order from here for probably a year because the quality of food went down so much but we were being lazy and just wanted some dinner delivered. I called off of the menu we had and when she gave me the total, it blew my mind. I told her she must have made a mistake because she was charging me way too much. She repeated the order back to me and everything was right. She then said they just increased their prices. It wasn't a small increase. It was a substantial one. It was so much I cancelled the order and found a new place to order my pizza and chicken. Can't risk the food being horrible for the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"Wow. I am really disappointed, and am starting to wonder, 

Are there any decent pizza places in old henderson ?!? 

We called and ordered for pick up.
1 pint of ranch.... What can I say, we love ranch.
1 medium hawaiian pizza
1 chicken tenders app (with fries)

We asked for the fries to be well done so that they are crispy, and they were limp.

The pizza tasted and had the consistency of needing more time in the oven. 

Worth $27? Not really."}
{"text":"The reviews of this place were mixed, but we ordered anyway because we didn't want to leave the hotel. The guy who answered the phone was nice and took our order. The delivery was timely and that guy was also nice. A little spendy for delivery of two philly's and a slice of cheesecake, but everything was really good. We'll probably eat there again before we leave."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  When we got there, it was warm and after we ordered, we were told that the air conditioning was not working.  Don't forget -- it was summertime in Vegas.  Okay -- we sat down under a ceiling fan, thinking we could weather the storm.

We didn't feel like pizza and my husband ordered chicken Parmesan and I order eggplant Parmesan.  We were served salads which were just ordinary.  Our main course arrived.  Personally, I don't care for it when eggplant or chicken is served on top of spaghetti, as opposed to it being next to one another.  This is how they both came out.  We were also given  what was a poor excuse for garlic bread.  In addition, the pasta was overcooked.  Once our dinners were brought to us, we never saw the server again, except from a distance!  I had to get up and get a straw myself.

Without the A/C it felt warmer and warmer.  About the same time we decided we couldn't stand the heat anymore, the cook walked out of the kitchen a few feet, poured himself a draft beer and stood there a minute  He took a few gulps and walked back into the kitchen area with his beer.  This was the straw that broke the camel's back.

It's no big surprise we will never go back.  Their prices reflected something decent but this place is just a joint.  Even their pizzas are expensive for what they are.  

Oh, well.  To each his own!"}
{"text":"I just had dinner at the sunset pizza on boulder Hwy , Henderson Nv. While eating my egg plant parmigiana dinner I found a piece of chicken wing bone in the center . My husband was having a meatball parm sandwich with fries so this couldn't have come from his plate . I took the chicken bone up to the cashier and told him about it and he said he would tell the cook . We sat there for an additional ten minutes and no one came out to talk to us . They are apathetic as you pay for the food at the counter . You already paid for your meal . They got their money so why should they care . This place is a disgrace to the Sunset pizza chain . DO NOT EAT THERE !!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and sandwiches!

Yes, I know it's a pizzeria, but I have to be honest in that I've lived in the area for almost a year and have yet to try their pizza.  It's just that I'm not tired of their sammiches yet!

My favorite is the Philly Cheese Steak.  It is H.U.G.E. Tender meat, plenty of peppers and mushrooms and just enough cheese to be creamy and delicious.  And the roll is just toasted enough.  There is a lunch special for a Philly Cheese Steak, Fries and a drink for $8.99.  My husband and I share it because it's that much food.  (And yesterday they even had the forethought to split it onto two plates before bringing it out to us - awesome!)  

The burgers are also giant and come on a great tasting bun.  We also share this with fries.

And, if you are all about the dippin' sauce like I am, their ranch dressing is a requirement for the fries (or last bites of sandwich bread or anything you can use as a vehicle for it).  They make their own in-house and it is the best I have ever tasted anywhere.

The service here is usually pretty good - it's an \"order at the counter\" kind of place which I'm totally cool with.  The one young guy we usually encounter here during the weekday lunch hour is very nice.  We haven't been in for dinner or tried delivery (yet).  :)"}
{"text":"I have only had a few things on the menu, the pizza, and the Philly Cheesesteaks.  My favorite item is easily the Philly with peperoni on it.  Having peperoni added to a Phily is a phenomenal idea that taste soooo good.  Also the prices are pretty good, I got a Philly with Fries and a drink for about $8.50.  Also the pizza is pretty good as well and they have some cheap combos with like 2 slices and a drink for really cheap.  It may not be the greatest pizza, but it's good.  Some might consider it a litle greasy, but I actually like it the way it is, and it has good flavor to it.  People have always been pretty nice here.  Unfortunately they are bears fans...Go Packers..lol"}
{"text":"first I was told to \"just hold on\" when I tried to place an order over the phone. So 
i hung up and got a decent person on my next try. The pizza we received had no flavor at all. I think they forgot to put any seasoning in the sauce. BORING.!!  The wings were ordered hot , what we got was unflavored and under cooked chicken. I had to toss them in my own sauce and cook them since I had a house full."}
{"text":"Always good food. Entire family loves it. Super busy at night. I love the ranch dressing. They have great lunch specials. 6 bucks for a slice of pizza, salad, drink."}
{"text":"I think my favorite thing on their menu is the fries. 

I go here now and then for work when my co-workers decide on this place. They love it. I, not so much. 

It's decent, and I eat it, but I wouldn't choose this place. I feel like it's super greasy pizza (denoting cheaper quality cheeses, usually) and just over all a lesser quality meal for the price. 

Like I said, I go here with work stuff, but it's just not on my \"go to\" list."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and fingers tonight for pick up. The pizza was lacking cheese and sauce. The fingers were no better than we could've made ourselves at 
home. $30 for a sub standard meal. Last time we order from them again."}
{"text":"This pizza joint has really yummy things! Personally i am not a huge fan of the pizza here tho its averagely good. The wings and appetizers are whats delish! They have a huge selection of foods on the menu, its hard to pick, haha. I've been here a few times and the only thing i can really say is the service isn't so great, people need to smile just a bit more. But overall this place is cool. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time eating from here.  We picked up our order of an extra large italian sausage, pepperoni, bacon and extra cheese pizza and an order of onion rings.  The only reason I am giving them two stars, is the onion rings were very good.  Our pizza crust was completely burned. We wont be eating their pizza again any time soon."}
{"text":"Hello fellow yelpers, im doing this for you sake. don't come here. im starving my ass off. waiting for the last 30 min patiently and everyone else who came here after us is already served. deeezzzz heeeaaazzzz best serve us soon. ddoz bittccchh best hurry FUCK THIS PLACE NEVER COMING AGAIN."}
{"text":"Tried a place in the area on St. Patrick's Day that ended up being super packed so did a quick Yelp search and found this spot. Decided to give it a try. 

We didn't have a wait here and immediately sat. No typical waiter style experience, you order at the counter and they bring to your table. I have no problem with that though. 

I asked the cashier about the wing sauce because my wife wanted less spicy. She told me the buffalo sauce is all the same- if you want mild, it's light sauce, if you want hot, it's heavy sauce. That's kinda ironic to me. I much prefer they have different levels of spice but if I'm being honest, it worked. Because I felt mine were plenty spicy and my wife didn't complain about the spice level. 

We got 40 wings and pizza. The wings were huge! Pizza was ok. I'm not the best pizza critic because I order pizza without cheese. Strange, I know. 

My buddy noticed the air vents above the table were incredibly dusty which was a huge turn off. 

Overall, the food was average. Nothing super exciting for me with the wings and pizza. 

I will say that it was consistently busy so people apparently are fans."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza and a great deal!  This is close to my work and my coworkers got it before and it smelled so good so I had to give it a shot!  I ordered a Large half meatball and cheese pizza and it was delicious and a great deal!  $9.95 I think!  It's awesome because it's less expensive than the medium.  

I hear the wings are great and they smell amazing so hopefully I will try those soon!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service isn't like it used to be.  They would bring your plates and forks to the table now you have to get them.  They didn't even check on us to see if the pizza was good or not.  The eating area wasn't as clean as it used to be.  To many buddy-buddies.  some of their buddies would go behind the counter which we felt shouldn't be there.  Looked at the chairs and there were several layers of hand and finger prints on the back rests that should be cleaned off.  They aren't going to go broke if we don't go back, we only patronize it maybe once every couple years, since the food isn't on our diets.

{"text":"This was close to our hotel in Henderson. Besides a small mixup on our order it was very good. We ordered 2 pizzas a chicken Cesar salad and a Philly cheese steak. The Philly was better than I was expecting. Pizzas were cooked well and had good flavor. Will try again I'm sure before we leave town."}
{"text":"I'm the first one to order when it opens! Is Super Bowl Sunday and Im waiting for my wings and fingers.  Its going to be so great with their fresh ranch sauce.  Woo"}
{"text":"I eat at this establishment with my child a couple times a month and this was our first bad experience. We ordered food to be delivered, the wait time given was 45 minutes to an hour. The food was delivered an hour and a half later. Only half of the order was brought and when I told the delivery man(PETER)  about the missing items he told me he was clocked out, lived around the corner and would not be returning to the restaurant for the rest of the food, but going home. When I told him ok I would just call sunset pizza back and attempted to shut the door, he put his foot in the door, continuing to argue. After he left I contacted the manager who asked me to pick up the items because them having to drive back would be a waste of their money. If the order was correct in the first place there would have been no need to drive back. He said he was sending it out with a new driver at 830, it is now 10:37 and the food never arrived. Very poor customer service"}
{"text":"I order from here all of the time. My kids refuse to eat any other pizza-we love Sunset. I always order pretty much the same thing, but when I called this time and ordered my antipasto salad and asked them to chop it up (I always ask, and it has always been done with a smile-I can't eat those huge slices of cheese and meat) I was told they \"they don't do that\" when I said I have always had it done, the girl who took my order said \"we don't do chopped salads, it's pre-sliced\" She was polite, but seemed annoyed. I ordered anyway, but am surprised as I've always had the absolute best service. Yes, I can take my time to cut up each piece on my own, but it's easier to do when it's not already on a salad. Only writing this because it was out of the norm and we regularly order from this (and the Horizon) locations. It's odd when your favorite place changed things up on you unexpectedly. Still love your pizza and garlic bread though!!

UPDATE: my pizza just arrived and it was cut crooked, the cheese wasn't evenly distributed (not like it had been tilted, like way more was applied some places, and the dough wasn't all the way cooked in the center. This has NEVER happened before! Do you have a new Friday staff? My family seriously orders almost every Friday and this was our first disappointment ."}
{"text":"I like the pizza at this place a lot it's delicious but tonight I decided to try something different and I had it delivered the delivery guy was very nice I ordered the gyro with a side of Tzatziki sauce it was awful the meat tasted burnt and the Tzatziki sauce taste like sour cream I would not recommend it at all....I also ordered a Greek salad it looks like a nice salad but really it's not very Greek at all .... stick with the pizza at this place"}
{"text":"I love this place, every time I come here from California, I bring friends. We have a blast, the food is good, atmosphere is good and the people are fantastic...5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza. My family stopped by last Thursday and we ordered a baked ziti, large antipasto salad, and mushroom/pepperoni pizza.

The salad is huge, an excellent price for the amount. Their Italian dressing - while not as good as Metro's - is pretty tasty and goes well with the salad toppings.

The serving of bread they offer is great: fresh, crispy crust and chewy interior.

The only caveat is that our baked ziti never went through on the ticket, so it wasn't made by the time we were done with the rest of our meal. The manager (unsure of his name) was extremely apologetic and gracious about giving me a refund since we were full and didn't want to wait for them to make a ziti. 

Overall, good food in a cute atmosphere. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Not an attractive place to eat at but the foods really good here. Got the meatballs strombol/calzone whatever they called it but it was was the best one of those I've ate, right out of the oven (about 15 mins to make), everything from the dough shell that kept it all together, chunks of mozzarella, meatball, marinara, onions and pepper was delicious.  it was pretty good size too for about $8.  I ate half and was stuff, enjoyed it that much that an hour later i finished the rest no matter how full i was.  

They have a pretty good lunch special menu of 13 choices ranging from about $6-9 all including drinks.

Located close to sunset park, if i had more time i would've ate it at the park outside in the sun. Stromboli took around 15 mins to make so I would order by phone first. Everything else they usally make quickly."}
{"text":"I found this place hit and miss. Last time we were here it was great. The first time we came it was awful. This time it was ok. We got a pizza, half bucket of chicken strips, and the cheesy garlic bread. Bread was a win. Pizza is just kinda soggy. Flaccid might be a better word. Chicken strips agree normally awesome, but this time they were kinda soggy and definitely not as saucy as normal. The price is good, and we will be back, but I'm hoping for some consistency."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers decent pizza at a good price. Not as cheap as Little Caesar's, or Domino's but way more affordable than the previous tenant -Villa Pizza.You can pick up a large cheese pizza for $9.99 with each additional topping an extra $1.25. 

We also tried the medium buffalo wings (10 wings for $8.99). The wings were nothing special so you might be better off getting another pizza instead. 

The service has always been efficient, and the staff is friendly. Considering the same order would be double the price at Villa- I am happy to support Sunset Pizzeria instead."}
{"text":"Ok folks this caught me off guard and I have been slacking on writing this review. I have ordered from this place quite a lot and it's time to give them there review. There hasn't been 1 time where I have been dissatisfied from them and I have had them a lot. My favorite choices there are the buffalo chicken fingers and pepperoni pizza. It's not greasy and has an AWESOME TASTE. Not oversauced or to much cheese. It's the perfect blend. The chicken fingers seem fresh all the time. They are always on time. One of my hidden gems on Boulder Highway"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing here: we had mushroom and sausage as well as pepperoni.  We also had the regular garlic bread and cheesy bread which were pretty good. They also deliver to our area which is kinda on the outskirts, so that's a huge plus. Will for sure be eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for a philly fix. I have been to the other sunset pizzeria's but something about this one keeps me coming back. They all offer the same menu and items i just think this one is staffed better. My personal favorite is the philly cheese steak lunch special. (Philly + fries + drink for less than $10."}
{"text":"The food! Sir. The food alone is worth the trip! 
     We love this pizzeria! We get the combo with a pizza, wings & chicken strip. It's always awesome. Customer service is fast and when you have two hungry kids that's what you want!"}
{"text":"Nice place...family run.  Staff was friendly and the Ala Roma pizza was delicious. (Italian sausage, salami, pepperoni, tomatoes and garlic) and the mozzarella sticks were good too!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Maybe the pepperoni has the same mind altering properties as magic mushrooms because there is no way the other reviewers are reviewing this pizzeria. 

The women behind the counter and the guy making the pizza were both very friendly and welcoming.  I picked up a menu (pamphlet)  while waiting for my pizza to come out and it reminded me of the Verrazano's Pizza menu in its style and a good portion of its offerings.  So far I was impressed with Sunset Pizzeria. 

A few minutes pass and my pizza comes out and was piping hot. It looked amazing. The cheese pizza here could pass for extra cheese at most other pizzerias. The first slice tasted pretty good. I'm not sure if it was my near starvation that made it taste good or that fact that it was molten lava hot so my taste buds were scorched from my mouth. The second slice I started to come to my senses and my taste buds regenerated. I could tell there was something  I wasn't a fan of. Third time is the charm right? Nope After the third slice I was convinced the quality was sub par and my hungry belly tapped out. 

Normally I can easily eat 4-5 slices in my hunger state but  Sunset Pizzeria your flavors or lack there of just didn't do it for me.  

It's not that its bad but its not at all good either. I could easily give the service 4 stars  and bump it up to a 3 star review but doing so would be a disservice to fellow Yelpers.  I find Sunset Pizzeria a place you could easily skip and your taste buds will thank me for it. 

If you must try it its near the bank across from  Sunset Park directly across the lot from Egg and I. The map on Yelp is deceiving."}
{"text":"I was expecting the best pizza in Henderson from reading the reviews here.

Unfortunately, the pizza was underwhelming. It almost looked and tasted like one of those $0.99 pizzas you buy at the grocery store. Very little dough, no crust, very little toppings.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. It was really good at first! We usually get the Spaghetti dinner for two and add meatballs. The last several times coming here we always say....\"We're never coming back here again!\" But we keep trying to give them a chance to get it right. I mean how hard is it to cook spaghetti??? Apparently EXTREMELY HARD! Now they raised their prices up 2 more bucks to $30 and their spaghetti is even worse than before....if thats even possible! We get the Spaghetti and our plates are full of water from the noodles NOT being drained properly! So.....we try and drain out all the water from our plates. About a half cup of water on each plate....at least!!!!! Then we attempt to eat this so called spaghetti. Noodles are water logged...over cooked and in 2-3 inch pieces!!!!!! Drowning in tomato pastey sauce and water! It was horrible!!!!! Meatballs were ok but had a weird burnt taste to them. And the garlic bread....OMG......I can't believe they even serve that!!!! It was at least a week old bread.....NO JOKE! It was like a cracker when you took a bite. Clearly not edible either! The salad use to be the reason we came here.....but now thats even inedible. They mince up old discolored thin salami and tiny pieces of cheese and sprinkle them on top. This is supposed to be an antipasta salad!!!!! They use dirty romaine lettuce that obviouly they don't wash....which in the end makes you extremely sick!!!! They should of stuck with just using Iceburgh Lettuce!!! Tomatoes are always horrible and not ripe and black olives are always old and taste spoiled. I just don't understand why they would serve HORRIBLE FOOD like this! They USE to have standards here when the first opened. You actually saw the ITALIAN GUYS cooking the food and running the place. Now they have some little girls with attitudes taking your order and NOT ITALIANS cooking Italian Food!!!!  We attempted to order a pizza here once....it was their Sunset Pizza......it was so disgusting we brought it back to the counter and ordered spaghetti and had the same horrific result as this time. Pizza was drowning in grease and you couldn't even pick up a piece of it because it was a soggy ugly mess. Soooo........I have thrown in the towel on this place for good! They clearly cut way too many corners here from the quality of the food they use to the cheap labor they have attempting to prepare it. Clearly the management have their heads somewhere other than in quality control and are in COMPLETE AND TOTAL DENIAL. Because I've complained to them in the past and there is no way they'd eat the HORRIBLE FOOD they are cooking! I don't know if the bald guy still works there....but he was the only one that corrected the food when it was inedible. The huge guy that claimed to be an owner.....well clearly he's clueless too now! So save your money people and go anywhere but here. You will just end up furious, sick and/or disappointed BIGTIME!"}
{"text":"I went here by mistake forgetting the original pizza shop that was here for 15 years moved down the street to Boulder & Lake Mead. Very rude. They told me the previous owner \"closed\" and they didn't know where they were. LIARS!"}
{"text":"we used to order from her all the time becasue of the lunch specials over the past few years. Sometimes they are friendly and fast but more times rude and impatient.  my prder contained a melted plasic container of ranch.  Apparently either putting on under hot greasy foos seemed like a good idea.  Now i know why I order once very blue moon.  oh to top it off my onion rings were raw on the inside :/  wish they were as good as the used to be"}
{"text":"I frequently eat here and I love it. It's a no messing around, straight to the point kind of place. The food is great. Customer service is good too. I usually just call & pick up or have them deliver, but yesterday I stayed and ate there. They checked on us multiple times, and were very polite. When we asked for something they were very fast, and didn't act like we were inconveniencing them, which I seem to feel like with a lot of other waiter/waitresses.

I've always had a good experience, and always worth what they charge."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It has so many choices. Meets just about any Appetite. Family ran. Don't let Grandpa scare you lol."}
{"text":"Usually not the best customer service but, great pizza!"}
{"text":"We LOVE sunset pizza. I think my family probably orders a pizza from here 1 sometimes 2 times a week! We've gotten a plain cheese pie which is great and have also tried the pepperoni and mushroom. The sauce is yummy and a bit tangy not sweet like some other sauces. The crust is my favorite. Thick enough to hold together the sauce, cheese and toppings but not too thick. The whole pie is cooked until the crust is crispy but not too done. Great NYC style folding pizza! and everyone who works there is super nice and delivery is pretty quick."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place! Best local pizza spot in the area...and they serve beer . It's a little pricey but quality costs so it's a must try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I rarely get anything I don't like and I must say the meatballs are amazing and the ranch is great. Once I received some over cooked fingers but we are always pretty pleased with everything we have had."}
{"text":"Small pizzeria on eastern and sunset....I'm alittle picky with pizza but really who isn't! I love the thin crust and sweet sauce....my fave to order is meatball and ricotta with red sauce soooo good. I also have had the wings and chicken fingers also very good and for those who have a ranch tooth...outstanding you could drink it! Today I had as calzone with pepperoni,meatball,and olives very tasty and not to mention huge. Definitely sharable. The staff is friendly and very the pizza man Chris hilarious! I highly recommend even to just stop by for a slice."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years, lately the Pizza has been excellent, the boneless wings and bone in wings are a must. You order at the counter get the deal with Pizza wings and soda, we feed our family for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We have been going to and ordering from Sunset Pizza for years. Tonight will be the last time. 

I ordered 2 meals tonight, nothing special, Chicken wings and a gyro and it took an hour and a half for them to deliver our food to us. I had to call to see if it was on it's way and then I finally received it 10 minuets later. I only live maybe 5 minutes, 10 tops from the restaurant and our food was disgusting. It was so Luke warm and soggy, we threw the majority of it away. 

Sunset Pizza used to be so much better! I'm not sure what happened but until things change they are going to continue to lose business."}
{"text":"The crust was good, thinner, but the sauce was pretty bland and the toppings were cubes and if you are gonna make a legit New York style pie, thin slice those veggies! Over all pretty underwhelming."}
{"text":"Jersey/ NYC style. Calzones are as good as any back east.  Oh and the pizza is good too!"}
{"text":"This is our go to pizza place since it's just around the corner from our house. Food is yummy and staff is friendly. We like eat on on the tables outside so we usually don't get great service but ehh who cares when you get to watch our gorgeous sunset while eating good food."}
{"text":"My friend got this pizza via take out from across town and I had a chance to try the sausage, pepperoni and meatball pizzas.

The sausage and meatball pizzas were up to par with my standards of a real pizza.

The pepperoni... oh my... the pepperoni pizza was AMAZING!  Something about it.  First of all, I usually do not go for pepperoni pizza, but this one looked so juicy I decided to go for it!

Their pepperoni is not some thin-slized version, this one was actually noticeably thicker than others and the taste was so savory.  I found myself eating even the crust on this one.  It wasn't too greasy and it definitely hit the spot.  The dough of the crust was exceptional and cooked just right... In fact I think I'll have myself one more slice right now!

You owe it to yourself to try their pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Just happened by this place last night. We had a large party including children and were staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas. This pizzeria was perfect. We enjoyed the spaghetti, a variety of pizzas, and fried zucchini. Everything was delicious. Highlights were the zucchini, garlic bread, and bacon and pepperoni pizza. Service was fantastic, and the New York themed decor was fun and interesting. A very casual, family restaurant feel. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing but the service is really lacking. Tired of having to throw the pizza in the oven when ordering delivery so we decided to go there and eat.... equally bad choice, saw the cook take our pizza out and watched while the other employees stood around chatting while our pizza sat and got cold before one finally brought it out. If the service was better this could be a five star establishment."}
{"text":"This is our home away from home--these guys are from the East Coast and when you try their pizza, that will be confirmed because their pizza is awesome!!  We had never tried their pasta before so yesterday we decided to skip the pizza.  I had their cheese ravioli with meatballs.  Hubby had the veal parm with pasta and they included garlic bread and salads.   Food came out quickly and was wonderful---and we had enough to take home for lunch this week!  FInally, we always take home some homemade cannoli and they are delish!!!   Their prices are good and they have a tip jar at the counter and pleasant service.  They just keep getting it right--bravo!!  :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We have eaten in and we have had it delivered several times. The pizza is delicious. Tonight I ordered a pepperoni calzone with ricotta. wow just like my favorite italian place in Denver. their calzone always comes with ricotta. Best I've had in a long time. The cannolli is so good very authentic."}
{"text":"Last time I will be ordering delivery here. 

1 lrg greasy pizza 
1/2 bucket of chicken fingers left in the fryer too long.

$30.00 not including tip -NOT WORTH IT Save your money!
Not to mention...Rudest delivery driver I have ever experienced.

Step it up Sunset Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place. The food is great employees nice. Service fast, we are big time 49er Fans this is now our #1 pizza place!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Great customer service. Food came right out, and it was perfect. Order the Philly Cheesesteak it's great. If you are in town, go to Sunset Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Becky and Janel were awesome and  very helpful. The new look is great not to mention so is the food."}
{"text":"Pizza was raw and cold in the middle, had to cut half of it off to get to the cooked part.  To bad cause the cooked part was pretty good"}
{"text":"Always a go to..delicious food, great service, and never too busy to accommodate your dinner needs! Pizza is awesome, fingers are delightful, and ranch is bomb.com  delivery is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"A good Philly cheese steak is hard to find in vegas...sunset pizzas is near perfect. ..also love their n.y style pizza...great pizza parlor. ."}
{"text":"My family and i love this place. Really great east coast style thin crust pizza. Family owned. They deliver too! Yum yum."}
{"text":"I'd driven by this place many times and always wanted to try it. Have to keep local businesses in mind....

The staff is all very young and stuck to their phones while at the counter. They were somewhat helpful, but it took a minute to get their attention. 

The wings had practically no sauce and tasted like they'd been in the freezer a little too long. They definitely lacked that fresh flavor. 

The pizza... Definitely cheap. You might as well grab a slice at your nearest gas station because that's what it tastes like. 

The food is cheap, but also tastes so. Guess I got what I paid for. Probably won't be going back unless for the fries, the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place...There Calazones..Is that the one with regular cheese, or is it the Stromboli?  Ummmm I can't remember, but I don't like the one with that white cheese in it, so that's what changes it from the Calazone to the Stromboli.  But this place is awsome!  We have been going here for 4 yrs, suprised, this was my first check in."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the pizza is awesome! The ranch dressing is also pretty RAD. However, the service at this spot left a terrible taste in my mouth. 2 weeks ago I ordered delivery, just a medium pie and salad for grand total of about $24. Standard operating procedure dictates card over the phone, no big deal. 1 hour and 45 minutes later, plus two phone calls my cold, somewhat icky food arrives. The delivery guy comps the grub and apologizes for the wait. I tip him $3 on the card, five days later I have a charge for $43 on my card. I call and tell them about the mistake ( hey, we all make em') , I'm told to bring my statement in to get a refund because cash is raise for them than crediting the card. Ok. I go in today and encounter a SNOTTY, NASTY girl behind the counter who did absolutely nothing to help other than be insulting and tell me to come back when there is someone there who can help. Wow, really?"}
{"text":"Somewhat friendly service. There's some employees that act like they hate their job and just gives off a bad vibe. The pizza and wings are so good. This is the only pizza place I ever go to. I highly recommend this pizza joint"}
{"text":"Good pizza! A little Greasy but still yummy!Try the fingers they're great! Our food came out quickly and everything looked and tasted like it was fresh. No table service but not much needed, had a good experience:)"}
{"text":"My initial review of Sunset Pizzeria was based on only one experience. I wasn't completely sold on the pizza, or the wings, but after waiting about a year we decided to give them another try. And I am so happy we did! 

Sunset Pizzeria is now our go-to place for pizza in Hendertucky... We got takeout from them on a recent Friday night... and then again on Sunday night.... and then when we had some unexpected company, AGAIN on Thursday night... 3 times in one week!! I think that warrants an upgrade from 3 to 4 stars.

I still don't love the wings or the chicken fingers... but the salads are decent, we get the antipasto often. The pizza is great. I love, love, LOVE the crust and that they are generous with the toppings. 

I also love that when I get food to go from Sunset, the employees always make sure we have everything we need... plenty of dressing for the salad, extra sauce for chicken, plasticwear, napkins. 

I think it may be time for a pizza intervention at my house, since we ordered so many times in just a week. It's just so good, and perfect for those hectic evenings when you don't have time to cook!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Pizza was great (awesome homemade crust), Stromboli was very good as well.  Save room for a Cannoli - delicious!!  Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! So much better than Johnny Mac's and much better prices. We order here a couple times a month and always get a consistent product. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Worst Philly cheesesteak I have ever had. The steak and onions were burnt. It tasted as though they hadn't cleaned their grill in ages."}
{"text":"If you are from NY you know how hard it is to find good pie in this town.  Considering the water quality they have to work with this place is not half bad.  Good prices and close to my abode .... 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Again rude...messed order up cold food and not very good. Not to worry went back to my favorite family restaurant shame on me for trying sunset pizza again. If you want to go to a awesome restaurant with fabulous food. Message me!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely prompt with order times and food is great as always. Large portions on everything!"}
{"text":"So the the floors are dirty. Every table was dirty. Had to clean our own table. We weren't told to order at the register. Until we happened to look in that direction and see the ugly Order Here sign. We ordered our lunch. We proceeded to get our drinks that came with our order but every glass had a hard white rim around the center of the glass. When we turned around another family was sitting at our table. The pizza had great flavor a but could have been cooked for maybe 2 more minutes. The crust was kind of raw in some spots. The staff was very nice overall. They need to have a better plan for their customer's experience."}
{"text":"tried this tonight - just got in before the dinner crowd jammed it up.  lots of family dining here.  I just ordered the large cheese and spinach + soda.  Pizza crust was just OK, sauce and toppings middle of the road.  I would suggest they add asiago to the toppings.  
no military discount, no wi-fi."}
{"text":"My last experience is this establishment was that it was dirty, the employees were rude, and were not helpful. The food is good, but service and sanitation make this a no brainer, and a 1 star place."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a low rating because I am a loyal fan and have been since they opened. However, for the past year, every time I order delivery my order has been cancelled or postponed by an extra hour due to having a late or no delivery driver, -_- I love your food, but if you don't have a dependable delivery service I'm going to have to order elsewhere."}
{"text":"Okay,  I hate to give this business two stars because I have been a fan since they came to vegas. However, for the past year, my order is either cancelled or postponed for an extra hour because they do not have a stable delivery driver. -_- Really? Hire someone who comes in on time or actually shows up because I would like to remain a loyal customer."}
{"text":"My two star review is based on the quality of the food, the service, and delivery time. 

Food - I have only ordered their cheese pizzas. Being born and raised on the east coast, this is hands down the best pizza in Vegas. I can't speak on anything else off the menu. My two stars are for the pizza and the pizza alone.

The service - Horrible. No accountability and too many excuses when mistakes are made. It's just absolutely ridiculous. 

Delivery time - DO NOT EVER have your pizza delivered from his location! You can always count on your pizza coming cold and AT LEAST a half hour late. There were a couple times that my husband and I accepted the pizza, sat down to eat and realized that it was freezing and would have to heat it up ourselves in the oven. Eventually after realizing that this location just was never going to get it right, we started picking the pizza up from the other location on horizon ridge. 

So, today we decided to give this place a 5th or 6th chance. Can't remember how many times they've screwed up. BIG MISTAKE!! 25 minutes late and freezing cold. Good thing we learned our lesson and opened the box before handing the delivery guy the money and taking the pizza.

Do yourself a favor. Dine in or pick up from the horizon ridge store. Whoever manages this location needs to take some tips from the Horizon Ridge location because their phenomenal. I would love to meet the owner actually."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place!! We always get the same special every time we go, so I can really only comment on the pizza and chicken fingers - which are so yummy!! The chicken fingers are nicely crunchy and saucy, and that ranch is soooo good and garlicky!! The pizza is a thin but the end crust is crispy on the outside and pillowy soft inside - ugh, so delicious!!! Now I've read some reviews, complaining that no one \"greets\" you and that their customer service is bad. I've been to MANY pizza shops that are set up just like this one is, it's pretty standard. There's a big sign as soon as you walk in the door that says \"Order Here\" so that's what you do! Usually we walk in, I go find a table and my husband orders - it's no biggie! And the customer service has always been great, we've never had a problem! I think sometimes you've just gotta be nice and people will be nice back - most customers expect over the top service when they themselves won't even say hello, please or thank you. I've said all three of these things every time I go and I get great service! And yes, it gets busy at mealtimes and for big sports events - it's a pizza joint!! If you're complaining that it's busy, maybe realize that's a good thing, other people obviously like their food too!!! My husband and I love this place, it's definitely a favorite local joint!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering wings 'plain & well done' for years now & have yet to ever have them perfect until last night. Very pleased with them! The ranch is really good too!"}
{"text":"They changed their chicken fingers. Horrible fingers. You can tell they are processed chicken like you would get at McDonald's! Won't eat there until they change back."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them a 2 because they are still declining and it should be noted they weren't always this poorly rated.

I don't enjoy writing a bad review however this has now repeatedly been earned and deserved.

At first it began with simple delivery orders:

- one completely forgotten until we called an hour plus later asking if they ever tried to deliver 
- three separate deliveries where we asked for a 2 liter of soda and each time they delivered soda that expired over a year prior (yes, soda goes bad - I wouldn't have thought about it either until I had to examine why it was odd tasting) we called to let them know and were consistently amazing at their disregard 
- food missing or poorly prepared 
- blue cheese that was allowed to go bad on multiple occasions, we called and it seemed of no concern 
- the last straw, my wife ordered their special (Feta Cheese Pizza) and the feta cheese had already expired and the pizza was a waste

When we started ordering here it was an enjoyable experience - now it's a health risk and a common waste of money.

I hope if you enjoy their food it stays that way but for us it's been a consistent disappointment with zero resolve or concern.  I can only hope the proprietor and management read this and take some real action before it hurts someone or their business further"}
{"text":"Ordered from here a month ago and it was great, pizza was crispy and like it should be, wings were good and I ordered a salad that was fresh and the ranch was awesome!  Ordered a large pepperoni pizza tonight, 20 wings, and a ceasar salad.  Pizza & wings excellent and it was delivered pretty quick. Glad they've picked up the pace."}
{"text":"Updating my review....it is now 2018!! Consistently some of the best pizza (good dough and lots of cheese)and wings around (always crispy and not greasy) around. We still get the blue cheese with our wings...still homemade with big chunks of blue cheese! Plus, right next to the movie theater. Always great customer service and we usually only have to wait 10 -maybe 15min tops to get our food to the table!! I will keep recommending this restaurant! Plus lots of t.v.s and cool decor inside."}
{"text":"Cold Pizza. 
In my immediate area I have several pizza places to choose from that all deliver. And those places like Papa Johns, Domino's, and Pizza Hut can bring me a pizza that is hot, or at least warm when it gets to my door. But for some reason Sunset can't seem to do that. Our order on 9/22/17 was not the first time we've received cold pizza upon delivery, but when the calzone we ordered was so soggy and bland that it was unedible that pushed it. But when my 7 year old refused to finish the luke warm spaghetti and complained about it, and being a kid he'll eat almost any kind of spaghetti, that was it for us.

When you drop $45-50 on an order at the very least you expect it to arrive and be at least warm, if not hot. The competition can do it so these expectations are not unreasonable. And I know a calzone can be made with the exact same ingredients that Sunset uses and not be soggy upon delivery so my expectations are not unreasonable. As far as I'm concerned Sunset just ceased to exist for my family as a delivery option. We're done."}
{"text":"Was initially thrown-off by a few minute wait at the ordering area, but was met with a friendly service and left satisfied. The place is hidden and has a no-frills pizzeria decor, but more importantly the food is good. I had the Philly cheese steak sandwich and my dining partner some pizza. The fries that came with my meal were thick cut and delicious. The cheese on my Philly was good provolone, and the sandwich bun was light and crispy. The thin cut steak with mushrooms, bell peppers and onions was awesome. The pizza was good too, albeit a little on the greasy side -- but that could have been the pepperoni. For sure returning and trying out more of their stuff. Great little place with a no-frills vibe and good food."}
{"text":"We get take out from Sunset once every two weeks the crust is perfect and they don't over do it with the sauce.  If you want thick crust and heavy sauce go back to Chicago, this is NY style pizza.  
The take out/eat in special is now a $9.99 large cheese, it was a one topping.  economy I guess...  Still great for the price."}
{"text":"We have lived in downtown henderson for almost 8 years and have been meaning to try this place for a long time. We usually go to Bistro Pizza a little ways away because it's so good. Well, Bistro was closed today so finally we decided to try Sunset out. 

Best decision ever. This place is now our favorite pizza place hands down. We got an extra large pizza with Italian sausage and garlic. It was so freaking good. Eat here. Like today."}
{"text":"Always good food. Love their thin crust pizza. Reminds of me of back home in Connecticut. 
We go often for both take out and eat in."}
{"text":"We have had pizza from Sunset about a half dozen times now, twice as a dine in, the rest were pickup or delivery.  At first I was not thrilled by ordering at the counter since we had to stand in line for a bit, just seemed awkward, but it works.  

They have a good variety of food but we are mixed on the ratings.  The pizza's we have got from here have been very good.  Generous amount of toppings, good sauce.  We have ordered the spinach pizza which was good but could have had a bit more spinach on it.  We have ordered their veggie which was also good with a good amount of toppings.  So why did they scrimp on the spinach that one time?  Maybe they were running low or something.  We have also got the Hawaiian and added green peppers and garlic, a favorite in the family and Sunset did a respectable job on it.

I like the fact that their crust is not greasy.

Where we have had trouble is with some of the entree's.  We tried the veal parmigiana, while it was good we did not think it was enough to justify the price.  Maybe we just got an unusually small order.  We also tried a meatball sub, which was OK but I wish they had toasted the bun first so it would not have been so soggy.  The cheesy breadsticks have always been good, but I have to remember to tell them go light on the cheese, my son likes a lot of cheese so he was happy.

We also ordered their stromboli which, like their pizza, was good.  I think your better off spending a few extra dollars for a comparable pizza though.

Lastly we got their chicken fingers lunch special once.  Pretty decent, but if I recall the ranch was a bit runny.  

I would give this place a higher rating except the mixed luck we have had with the entrees.  

By the way, friendly staff."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Pizza great! Wings great! RANCH amazing...everything is really good & fast service"}
{"text":"Sunset is a great pizza place if you dine-in.    When I have it delivered its not as good but whose is?   Doesnt hold up as well in the delivery but a very good local pizza."}
{"text":"I think they have GREAT specials..their hot wings are huge...very tasty pizza and very friendly family business..."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has solid food, though the service and the way everything is set up leaves a lot to be desired.

Essentially, this is the place that moved into the building where Villa Pizza's old location was. As such, I had high hopes for it. In some ways this place hits the mark, and it some ways it falls short.

Firstly, the positives. While I have not eaten here a whole lot, I am pleased to say that all of the food I have had in there has been excellent. During my visit tonight I have a cheese calzone, which is definitely one of the most delicious I have ever had. What few other items I have eaten here have been good as well, including many of the pasta dishes. I have noticed other reviews bashing the food here, but I have never had a bad meal here. The counter staff that we dealt with were all friendly and professional.

Of course, with a three-star rating, as you expected, there are bound to be some negatives. During our whole meal, right behind us, a group of employees (presumably the family that owns the restaurant) was arguing loudly over who gets what days off and what their plans for the Fourth of July were going to be. This was totally unprofessional and inappropriate. If you're going to have these arguments, step outside or go in the back room. You DO NOT do this in front of your customers. Again, the staff I dealt with at the front counter were all friendly and did their job well, but this group of people in the back corner needs to learn a thing or two about what constitutes professional behavior in the workplace.

The other issue I have is that, while this is a \"dine in\" restaurant, you have to go up to the counter and order, and get your own drinks. When I get off work and am tired, I like to be served. This is more annoying than helpful. There is not a large printed menu so you have to get one of the little paper ones to find what you want. This just seems like an outdated way of doing business in a place like this, and is a disappointment. This is a shame, as the food is very good.

Overall, this place is not all that it could be, but the food is solid and it is worth stopping in if you are in the neighborhood. Hopefully you will not have to deal with loud and unprofessional staff arguments when you go in."}
{"text":"Sooo got delivery for two grilled ham and cheese. What we got was two ham and cheese subs. Called the location back nicely and told them that the order was not correct. The girl got straight attitude with me saying that I ordered subs and that she read my order back to me. She insisted I was not correct. Told her that she can fix the problem or I would gladly back charge my credit card. She tell me she will bring us the corrected order but that she is picking up the subs and we better not have eaten them! Haha ok you can have the uneaten subs... We didn't eat them anyways cause it is not what is ordered. What a joke. Won't be returning here for my weekly deliveries after this poor customer service."}
{"text":"We just had cheese steaks, chicken cheese steaks, and a cheeseburger! Everything was amazing.. Great food.. Great service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza, half a bucket of wings and a ham sub. Delivery took 33 minutes. Pizza was true New York style, wings tasted like they were straight from Buffalo and the sub was amazing. Very pleased. Great quality awesome prices and fabulous service!!"}
{"text":"Lunch time in my office is like being at a Presidential Debate... Everyone wants something different, so we spend like 30 mins deciding.. Of course if I am buying they usually dont complain.  Well today they wanted PHO, Pizza and burgers... Today i told them you guys are on your own... I wanted a steak sub no cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, thats it...  I tried this Sunset Pizza today,,, at the corner of Eastern and Sunset, tucked away in the shopping center... I ordered the steak sub with fries and a drink for $7.50.  I have to say that i really liked this sandwich, there was a good amount of meat, the fries,, what made this stand out was the sub roll... I was really liked this bread... This wasn't the best steak sub ever but I feel this was one of the better subs i have had in the valley...  I reccommend the Steak Sub, will try the pizza next time...  If you are in the area, and can find this joint,, try it out.... Hope this yelps

Update  10-22-12
Ordered a sicillian pizza, it was ehhhh....  I wont order pizza from here... Maybe you will like it..  Subs are good i cant complain about it.. Pizza not so good... Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and grinders for delivery. The pizza is thin crust and delicious! The meatball grinder was fantastic! I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular on busy nights so call ahead if you are in a time crunch. The food is ok, not bad not amazing. The service for the most part is fine. The atmosphere is fun for a casual place. They have good choices in soda and you get free refills.
 What I love about them is you can get a salad with something instead of fries. The salads are good too.
 Pretty good local place. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza here once before. One night when my family, with kids, quickly grabbed a simple sausage/pepperoni before a movie a couple months ago.  It was reasonably priced and I thought it was pretty good.  THAT'S the only reason I am giving them 2 stars.  We just ordered a couple pizzas tonight, and the supreme we ordered was disgusting.  It's like they took a perfectly good pizza and then decided to stick it behind a mesquite muffler for 5 minutes.  I didn't ask for a \"smoked\" pizza!  But, regardless of their signature \"recipe\" which I will never endure again, the worst part was finding the 12\" long black hair that was woven thru the 2nd slice I had the misfortune of picking up.  Please laugh, because that's all I could do except make Sunset my 2nd review and 1st negative one.  I'm not gonna filet this establishment, because I can see their value as a family place to take the kids after a school game or before a movie. However, if you're looking for a quality pizza, hair-free, move along.  I like pizza, but this was the worst I can remember.  Never again."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here since they first opened, until today. The pizza and the service were still great. A nice clean restaurant with good tasting food! Great prices for lunch too."}
{"text":"I am about to share a couple of personal comments on the pizza. This doesn't mean I'm complaining. I did give it 4 stars after all. It was a great lunch for my son and I. Also I walked into the door of my house holding leftovers and ate another piece. I'm not certain if this is a matter of my bad habits or the great taste of their pizza.

I'd say that the crust is a little too sweet. The sauce is a bit acidic like I can feel the heartburn coming on. At least it's not that slap your tastebuds around nasty tang stuff. It's a good NY tomato tasting sauce.

The lady that works there is nothing like my mom, but she is so sweet I wish my mom were more like her. My 7 year old son loved the place, but that would explain why he was the one who recommended it."}
{"text":"They have a lot of good deals, their medium pizza is good for 2 or 3 ppl. They have a lot of classic cars as decor and mob posters. 
Must try their BBQ chicken fingers, it isn't on the menu but if you ask they'll smother the chicken in their sweet bbq sauce. You get 5 big fingers plus fresh fries for only $9 
The wings are good, not wow omg gotta have it all day every day but they are good :-)
Service is great, cashiers always friendly.
The only negative comment I would have is the wait time but their food is made fresh and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Solid pizza with good service.
Smaller shop with less seating."}
{"text":"Wing were freezer burnt and over cooked in old oil. Pizza had to much grease. Crust was good. Would be a good hang over meal. Price was higher than comps around the area. Not something to write home about. Eat one slice of pizza each and a couple wings each and left."}
{"text":"superbowl sunday had to have some fingers. asked for 1/2 hot and 1/2 medium.      !/2 bucket cost $22 . No problem right !  WRONG!  Worst fingers ever.... Dry, not hot at all!!! Ate 2 and threw them away. What a waste of money.  $25 with tip.  made a grilled cheese sandwich and watched the game.. Super disappointing"}
{"text":"The pizza is just right! They're in the thinner side but cut so that each slice is huge. The flavor is why you keep going back over and over and over. I actually prefer this pizza over any other in town. The wings are crisp and are actually coated with your selection of sauce. They have amazing lunch specials but the homemade ranch is the star of the show, please see the big sign that says RANCH IS ADDITIONAL COST! Lol! Great for movies at the cinedome then for a bite. Henderson staple, for sure!"}
{"text":"Tip: if you want good pasta, don't ever order pasta here. It was awful. I don't even think my dog would have liked it. They basically over cooked some pasta that was all stuck together (umm hello olive oil) and threw some sweet Ragu tasting nasty marinara on it. I could have had something better for about 4 bucks from the frozen food section from Stouffers. If I could give it zero stars I would. Waste of my money."}
{"text":"My company bought us this pizza for catered lunch. I must say that I was very impressed with the quality of the pizzas. The crust was crispy and delicious while the cheese and sauce were clearly made from exceptionally fresh ingredients. This is one of the few pizza places I've ever eaten at where even the \"plain\" cheese pizza is flavorful and great. I would highly recommend this pizza place to anyone who enjoys good food."}
{"text":"Staying in Vegas and wanted some pizza off the strip. Ordered a large pepperoni and meat lovers. Both were really good except the cubed ham on the meat lovers, but there was friendly service. Would return if in town again."}
{"text":"I love to support the 'little guy' and not the chains...that said, this was the worse pizza I've ever ordered!  I gave them 2 tries...both times I was quoted 45mins for delivery... both times it was well over an hour before I got my pizza and BOTH times it was barely warm and soggy!  I was surprised it happened a 2nd time considering I told the girl on the phone about the last experience!  I told her maybe I should talk to the manager and she said there wasn't one on!  So when I called back after an hour and 20 minutes the guy said he would get the manager?!  Interesting!  Yes, he went ahead and comped my pizza....but that was after making excuses about being slammed and it's Wed and there is come car thing.  Not to be rude, but not my problem when I was quoted 45 mins and willing to pay over $20 for a pizza!"}
{"text":"This is what a pizza joint is supposed to be like.  Red and white checker table clothes, friendly service and good pizza.  Fair prices and large servings.

The pizza crust was thinner than a regular but I wouldn't call it thin crust.  The crust folded nicely and it had some crunch to it.  The toppings seemed fresh and plentiful.  We had the Al Roma pizza - sausage, pepperoni, and fresh tomatoes.  It was real good.  The antipasto salad was good too.  Straight forward mixed lettuces, provolone, salami, olives, peppercini, tomatoes, onions and it all tasted fresh.  A small is plenty for 2-3 people.

They had a selection of beers here, but I stuck to the Dr Pepper. 

I can be a stickler when it comes to pizza, but this place really impressed me."}
{"text":"Would have liked to try you guys, but after 20 minutes your phone line is still busy. I called another location and was told that one of the perverts would contact this location about the issue. I tried several more time before ordering from a competitor. I called back after placing my order elsewhere and the line was still busy. You can't do business if your customers can't reach you."}
{"text":"I have had their wings and pizza and both are good. Relaxed atmosphere. Fries are great too and they give lots of ranch. Fountain drinks are self serve and beer is also available for purchase. Great spot if you are in Henderson...definitely the only pizza place worth visiting."}
{"text":"About once a month my large family comes in, pushes tables together and enjoys a great meal. We order a couple of pizzas, teriyaki wings, fries, and fried mushrooms. Their ranch is to die for, the pizza is delicious (and even better the next day, warmed up in a frying pan- adds a nice crisp). Their cannolis are fantastic, too. The service is great, the place is clean, delivery has always been prompt and I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Heck I have lived here in old Henderson now close to a decade and just yesterday ordered my very first pizza from this awesome out of the way restaurant. Wow, just wow. Great food! A mellow relaxed atmosphere, and fast efficient service. Thank you Sunset Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch and ordered the large pizza and half bucket of wings special. Diet dr pepper needed changed and they did it promptly and let me know when it was ready. Wings were great. A little more meat than some but sauce was perfect for size. Pizza was excellent. Toppings plentiful. We both were definitely full when we left, and still had enough leftovers for our family of 5 to have for dinner. Think we have found our pizza place!"}
{"text":"I like to order from here when not everyone can decide what they want to eat.  They have a full menu, and much more than pizza.  The pizza itself is good, nothing fabulous.  I've also had the gyro, which was a bit disappointing, but edible.  I probably wouldn't order it again.

The location is cute and located right by the movie theater, so it's great for a pre-movie bite.  I also love that they deliver, that is always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Good nearby pizza place. Has good wings too. Their dressing is homemade. But thay are no Montesanos . Never had a bad experience . Been there a dozen times"}
{"text":"Have lived near here for over a year and never tried it out until today. Really reminds me of neighborhood pizza places I loved as a kid. We got a special with antipasto, pizza and bread for lunch and really liked it. My kids are young and very picky, but they loved it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday. They have a nice menu and if you like thin crust they have one of the better ones. Good lunch specials.

Place is decorated in a mob type theme, and eclectic mix of signs and Nevada stuff. Staff was friendly. Place was clean. I had two slices with one topping and a drink for $7. 

I'll be back to try other lunch menu offerings. Plenty of parking available and located next to the movie theatre."}
{"text":"Cashier: \"Do you know what you want?\"
Me: \"yes\"
Cashier: \"ok, what?\"
That should have been my first clue. $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids to eat at a pizza place? And the food was average at best. It was quick (probably because everything was premade) so that's why I'm giving 2 stars. But I will definitely not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Finally, I found pizza done right!  I have eaten a half dozen pizzas on the last six months that have been sub-par at best!  Unfortunately, 8.5 miles away but in the neighborhood of my new doc so, I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Just ok nothing special ordered fingers & pizza not a lot of flavor pizza so greasy busy Friday night I guess but not sure would be back again"}
{"text":"Kids asked me to try again since it wasn't a Friday night...against my better judgement I did.  Wait time an hour and 20 mins I should have said no thank you and called someplace else because I knew it wasn't going to be good. When the delivery man handed me the box I knew right away because the box wasn't even the slightest bit warm. I was right I had to heat everything except the salad I put that in the fridge for today so I could eat a cold salad.  The cheese on the pizza had hardened back up because it had cooled down and sat for so long.  The fries...my kids could eat about half of them because they were so over cooked and when reheated they were just to far gone.  Last time I had a bad experience I asked them to not store my credit card information and I was assured it was taken out.  Imagine my surprise when I called and was ready to give card info and I was asked \"card ending in xxxx\"  It's blacked out in the receipt but after having asked it not be stored they lied about it being removed!"}
