{"text":"Rustic bread and pasta bowl were fantastic. Friendly, intimate and romantic. May go back one last time before heading home from our weekend away."}
{"text":"Campo di Bella is my new favorite \"special dinner\" place in the greater Madison area. Nestled in the beautiful country side of Mount Horeb with rolling hills, and dramatic sunsets, lives this lovely farmette and restaurant for a true farm to table experience. The owners, Mary Ann and Marc, not only own this lovely restaurant, they are the chefs and residents on this farmette. We thoroughly enjoyed every minute we spent there. From sitting on the terraced patio with pre-dinner wine to the fantastic 5 course meal. The entire meal featured produce from local CSA, Vermont Valley Farm. The starter was beet salad, to zucchini & Gruyère cheese, to the delicious main course, Ratatouille, followed by a stunning cheese platter featuring one of my favorites, hooks. After that we were offered a personal tour of their picturesque farm. Once we got back, a delicious ice cream with a reduced balsamic & apricot sauce was waiting for us. Such a wonderful evening and I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I attended their Pasta Bolognese Cooking Demonstration Class and it was awesome.  They showed us how to make authentic Italian Bolognese sauce - using pork and vegetables from their own farm.  Delicious!  They even made fresh pasta, shared the recipes and sat down with us for a meal that was to die for.  I'll definitely be back for another Cooking Demonstration Class and a Farm to Table Dinner."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the farm last Saturday night, it was wonderful. A really unique dining experience. Started with good wine, conversation and great people. The food was outstanding we enjoyed every course. You can tell they put their heart into their cooking and and enjoy making wonderful food. We will be back and will bring friends. Bill n Kim."}
{"text":"We happened upon this little winery on our way home. It looks like you are taking a wrong turn but then you end up at this fantastic little tasting room and farm. We sampled their own wine as well as several others from Italy, France and California. The wines were selected to pair with their food and were very delicious. We were not expecting to stay for dinner but were so impressed that we decided to get theor three course dinner. We had a cheese board, pesto pasta and mint ice cream. Everyone complimented the food as well as the wine. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The land (farm) it is on is very beautiful. As my husband and I were walking up to the building, we got the vibe that we were about to interrupt the family in the middle of dinner (obviously though we weren't). You can have tasting / samples of wine without an appointment but there's no point (at this time of year) since the wine they have came from other wineries so chances are you have already tried them. The lady there was very friendly but she was a bit \"scatter-brained\" and was all over the place."}
{"text":"Attended a dinner with my husband and parents for a special night!  It is a fantastic start to a very dreamy dining experience. We left thrilled, understanding it is a very small family run business just getting their feet off the ground.  The concept and natural setting were beautiful... Everything fresh and organic, with a little introductory story before each course.  Not sure if the lamb and french herbed potatoes could ever be topped!  So delicious, and I had no idea I even liked lamb.   It was about to storm and when we arrived, we were pleased to see there was an actual indoor dining room (and not just a tent).   They have a bar that's a little too small for taste testing the wine, and the acoustics make it very loud- but they are on their way to something big!  Thankyou Campo di Bella for the real food and real authentic experience!"}
{"text":"A total and delightful surprise. The food is carefully prepared and thoughtfully presented.  Excellent wine choices."}
{"text":"What a gem! I've been here twice now with groups of friends for dinner and wine. It's been very enjoyable both times. You can experience a little bit of Italy on a working Wisconsin farm. There are theme dinners that look wonderful even though, as a vegetarian, I can't partake in many of them. They raise and serve their own heritage pork and lamb as well as vegetables from their farm. The wine selection is varied and they have an affordable wine tasting option to help you select the wine(s) you prefer. There is a beautiful, modern indoor seating area and a spacious patio that looks out over the farm. You can't ask for friendlier hosts. Check out their Facebook page or join their email list to learn more about their special dinner events."}
{"text":"Amazing experience at Campo di Bella last night, we had the pleasure of joining them for the wine makers dinner featuring Wollersheim's Wine maker Philippe Coquard; both food and wine amazing! Mary Anne and Marc are wonderful hosts, the food delicious and service superb.  Each course was better than the previous , topped off by warm chocolate soufflé just out of the oven! It was a great way to share a true farm to table experience w/ our dear friends from Chicago!  I look forward to joining them all again very soon!"}
{"text":"What a great night my husband and I had here last night! Every course was delicious...kale caesar salad, bowtie pasta with pesto, grilled steak with balsamic and vegetable ragout, a cheese board and strawberry sorbet. Each dish was as fresh tasting as could be. The farm location is beautiful and perfect for sitting back with a glass of great wine. (and how delightful were all the fireflies as we were leaving?) Mary Ann and family and crew were all terrific. A perfect summer experience."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!  Mary Anne and Marc have done an outstanding job with this delicious dining experience.  The only disappointing factor is that we live 2 1/2 hours away but it will not stop us from returning and bringing friends.  We thoroughly enjoyed every dish that was presented and the addition of the Hook's cheeses made for a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"I attended one of their famous dinners with a friend. After checking in and grabbing libations, we roamed the grounds a bit (a working farm) and looked at the pretty scenery and livestock. Raised beds were already planted with the ingredients of summer meals to come. It's bucolic and lovely--a great place for lovers.  When it was time, we sat at our assigned seats, family-style at long tables. Our waiters were the family's children and friends--they were absolutely charming. The matriarch of the family introduced herself, the winery's mission, and then the guests of honor--an apiarist (beekeeper) and his wife, who provided the featured ingredient for the night (honey).  Each course was introduced with a little background: pasta e prosciutto (this MAY have been my favorite), chicken piccata w/cipolla agradolce, crostini featuring three types of brie. The last was handmade honey ice cream with carmelized walnuts. It was insane. My taste buds were dancing, and I'm not one for Italian food.   The bathrooms were very clean, and there appeared to be more than enough parking. We were given honey to take home with us (a choice of wildflower, comb, or whipped). I'm enjoying my wildflower honey every morning in my tea.  I should mention here that there were about 6-8 choices of wine to enjoy (this is a winery, after all!). I didn't, however, imbibe. Wine and I are not friends. I enjoyed a craft beer instead, and then stuck with water for the rest of the evening because I like to keep my wits about me when enjoying food of that caliber.  I will definitely be coming back. Hopefully with a date.  ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and a fantastic experience! Went there on a cold March night. Had an intimate dinner with family. Our host was knowledgeable and very entertaining. Enjoyed some fantastic wine, appetizers and pasta. Can't wait to visit here again soon - on a warm night when we can sit outside!"}
{"text":"To start you cannot beat the drive out to the farm. It is stunning through the beautiful hilly terrain near Mount Horeb. Then the farm to table experience, with all of Wisconsin's bounty, was spectacular. We went for the vegetarian meal, perfect fit for August. Great food, lovely setting, enthusiastic and engaging hosts. Unbelievable cheese from Hook's and Dream farm. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Had a five-course vegetarian feast featuring Vermont Valley produce. All courses were simple and delicious. Each course was introduced and the event included a farm tour led by the proprietor's young son.  Seated family style but served individually.  Reservations required. Wine only (no bar or beer).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of working with Mary Ann Bellazzini for a Bachelorette Party for my dear friend. She was so kind in the weeks leading up to the party and accommodated our large group of 15 ladies. We were seated on the patio and given a wine tasting with a gorgeous back drop. One of the ladies got the cheese board and loved it. Definitely plan to go back! Beautiful, good wine, great service."}
{"text":"This was our second time doing a farm to table dinner at Campo di Bella. Both times the staff was friendly and accommodating. Dinner was served family style with engaging company. The food is delicious and you can tell that it is hand made over the course of hours.   A great stop to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Can't wait to go during the summer to have wine and cheese on the patio."}
{"text":"Great place. Different then anything around. True farm to table on the farm. Great food, wine and service with a lovely view. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So amazing and gracious. We showed up for a farm to table night without reservations and were seated and served a wonderful meal with wine pairing. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I like to leave a restaurant feeling like I got a good meal for a good value and sadly I can't say that with my experience here.  The wine selection is nice and this is a good place to take a date just to grab a glass of wine and enjoy it at a rural farm type setting. It's very pretty here.  The problem is with the value part.  Mt Horeb is beginning to suffer from restaurants that are overpriced and this place is no exception.    The portions were tiny. The cheese plate that we shared between 4 adults only gave us a small bite size piece of 4 varieties and it was $14.  The salad was also just a few leaves of lettuce and everyone at my table agreed it was too small for the price.   The main entree, which happened to be spaghetti marinara (no meat) was $15. It was good but again, the portion was small.  Lastly, we ordered a bread as it didn't come with the entree.  The owner brought out this tiny piece of bread to share between 4 people. It was literally laughable how small it was and it was like $5 or so.   The main reason why I was really bothered by my experience is because the owner, who was a seemingly nice lady, was waitressing all alone. We witnessed people at other tables shaking their heads as they waited to order more wine. A lot of empty glasses because the owner apparently doesn't want to hire and pay for help. Don't expect to grab a quick meal here or to get prompt service.   I can't explain why there is no hired help but it gave me the impression that the owner wants to keep all the profits for herself at the expense of the customers.  Maybe that's not the case, but I don't know why else she wouldn't hire people so the patrons can get the prompt service they are paying for.  It just doesn't look good.  Our bill for 4 people with wine included was right around $300.  So if you go here, be prepared to drop about $75 per person if you drink wine.  Glasses of wine if I remember were around $8 to $12 per glass.  My recommendation to the owner would be to hire some help and make your portions bigger.  If she did those two things, the experience could have been much better."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, farm fresh vegetables and meats, welcoming owners. Was not the easiest to find but well worth the trip. If you are looking for a special place to celebrate you have found it here."}
