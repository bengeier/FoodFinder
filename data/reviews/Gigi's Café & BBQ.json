{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of chicken, and good chicken, which wasn't to be found in this neighborhood before GiGi's came along.  The Broaster chicken ( Which seems to be a combo of roasting and broiling to get a crispy skin and no grease with juicy insides!) is so good! They also have beef ribs which makes us so happy as we don't eat pork! ( There are pork ribs and pulled pork sandwiches as well for the piggy lovers.) The sides are great- we had the homemade fries, coleslaw and baked beans ( Also meatless, but with a mesquite flavor.) The BBQ sauce is sweet and savory, and worth the mess! Not to mention that the orders came with biscuits that they bake in house and they're perfect for sopping up sauce! 

Save room for dessert, as the butter cake is to die for. Gigi herself brought my husband and I each a sample piece and it was the best dessert I've had this year. The Owners are sisters and are so nice, and they deliver! We've found our new BBQ place and are so excited!"}
{"text":"Get the BBQ Chicken!

Just opened today! I was looking for the previous restaurant and was surprised by a new place! Very friendly staff, great BBQ Chicken. I'll be back!!"}
