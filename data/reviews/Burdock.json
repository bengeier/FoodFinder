{"text":"Great to see another new microbrewery pop up and their beer is great. Interior decor was well thought out and designed, patio is nice and they have a bottle shop that's open until 11."}
{"text":"Loved every beer we tried (and we tried all of them - the Belgian table beer was a favourite), and the Brussels sprouts poutine are a must. We didn't try any of the main courses. Server was efficient, attentive, and friendly. Go early because it fills up fast."}
{"text":"The Burdock is a very new restaurant/bar/venue and it does all three very well. The food is fresh and delicious, and is prepared artistically and creatively. The friendly staff know just what beer to pair with your food, and I see they are nearly finished building their own in-house brewery. The beer selection is diverse and carefully thought out, and the team of brewmasters are very knowledgeable and like to share this knowledge to those who are curious. 
On to the venue, it's in the same building but is isolated in a sound-proof theatre space through a couple heavy doors. The space looks to hold about 100 people and is beautifully designed with extreme attention to detail with regards to the acoustics. The shows they book are extremely diverse. 
All in all, not too many places have such a dedicated staff of friendly people striving for something special. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfection. Food and drink menus have something to offer everyone. Music and lighting are pure taste. Servers are beyond kind and helpful. 
A great, inclusive place to bring your date, your family, your birthday, or just yourself!
They've also spared no expense on the venue: clean sound in a beautiful, cozy-feeling room. 
New Bloor West friends!!"}
{"text":"Burdock has a really nice ambiance. The space has great lighting, decor, and just a nice overall vibe. The staff was very friendly and welcoming and we had good service (although I was there on a quiet night). The food was good but not great. Good ingredients and everything tasted fresh, but I found some things my friend and I ordered were a bit bland. I do appreciate that they use a lot of local and seasonal ingredients, and they are very vegetarian/vegan friendly. Also the vegetarian plate (which was all vegetables, no protein) was priced the same as the meat dishes and so seemed a bit overpriced. That being said, they have a good selection of beer and drinks and snacky food and I will definitely be back for those!"}
{"text":"They're making really interesting beers here, and have an interesting line-up of live music.  In some ways they seem to aspire to be \"upscale\" in appearance and atmosphere (I would prefer a more unpretentious, down-to-earth vibe, myself), and some of their staff can be a bit stiff, which puts me off.  But the beer is a good enough draw for me  I wouldn't eat here--the food is decent, but much too overpriced.  I shared a plate for two at $38, and while it was fine, it was nothing special and should have been cheaper given the quality and quantity (even as much as $15 dollars cheaper, I'd say)."}
{"text":"3-3.5 its a place that has invested in a micro brewery in the back of the restaurant. Good selection of beer and food that also feature beer in its ingredients. Its has a minimum menu but its has enough variety for casual dinner for sharing or small apps. Although I did enjoy, the bread and cheese/beer dip it was very overpriced at $10. The decor and service was cosy and casual. Main of ribs were tender but the mix of vegetables on the side was not overly unique. Its also has a nice patio. I would recommend it as a place to chill, and have drink but food is ok to not bad."}
{"text":"Love the patio in the summer with their amazing beer - we really enjoy having this place in our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent find for a vegetarian friendly place with a great atmosphere!  I love the lights, tiles and plants. 
With 4 main course options, 2 were veg friendly. The sweet potato croquette and Swiss chard were delicious!  The service was great and friendly!  
It was a little bit noisy (maybe all the hard surfaces as well as a few rowdy people).  I enjoyed the 90s hip hop, although not sure all crowds would (maybe a Sunday night thing). 
And kombucha on tap! Yes!  Just wait till they start making beer!  Definitely like what they are doing there!"}
{"text":"delicious farm to table food 
and my favourite-
KOMBUCHA on tap.

they brew their own beers (epic!) + they make their own sourdough and rye seeded bread? they exhibit all the qualities that a bread-a-holic, such as myself, look for.

portions are small and a tad expensive but SO worth it when you know the ingredients are sourced locally, wholesome and nutritious.

the pork melts in your mouth and the pickled veggies were to die for."}
{"text":"Sadly, thus spot is nothing special. The beer is a huge disappointment, and I tried a few. They all lacked a certain oomph. Just because it's craft beer doesn't mean it's good. Service was less than enthused (3 out of 4 servers we dealt with clearly had something better to do) And... I don't get all the raving about the bread. It's bread people! $6 for a few slices of chewy sourdough and a pile of butter? You want homemade bread? Try Terroni or Sud Forno. Or your local Portuguese bakery. Or even an Ace baguette from Loblaws fergodsake.

I love food. I love beer. I wanted to love this place. But... give me a cold Mill St tank house (yes, even post Labatt takeover - gasp!) and a big ole bag of New York Cheddar Kettle chips and my Friday eve is a happy place indeed. For, coincidentally, about $6...

Dear all the people who wrote the salivating reviews: I think all that Pabst Blue has done something wonky to your taste buds. Please consider medical assistance.

Dear everyone else: save your money."}
{"text":"They charged me $$ for extra cheese for my pasta dish.. Haha. I love these new high end everything is natural we just killed the pig places. A tiny little silver bowl of extra cheese. Italians everywhere shed a tear. No need to go back."}
{"text":"This is a romantic beer place! 

I love the cute tables and chairs, the ambience, the plants, and the beer, of course. I like how the beer selection is organized by mood or style, and enjoyed some bottles that were brewed and conditioned in-house.

The food menu is limited but I suppose they don't want to make that their focus.

Service was great - didn't have to wait long for anything even though it was a bustling and busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Really nice looking bar that is also pretty relaxed. Clean as your Aunt's home in Switzerland. They have a large bar at the back where they pump the house taps. It's a nice place to sit. Bottle takeout at the very back operates till 11 PM.

Impressive variety of sours and Saisons and everything else. The really good fruit-infused beers seem ti run out fast! I've stopped by for many a sample or a pint, and taken bottles with me plenty of other times. Haven't eaten much here. This place is almost the Other Bellwoods, and it has some beers like NOOM that are so good to me it defies logic there is not as much hype over Burdock. But whatever."}
{"text":"Beer and food were good.  The service is too slow.  I get that they're going for a laid back, neighborhood vibe but very long waits with no drinks while trying to enjoy a place that specializes in beer feels really off."}
{"text":"It's not often I give a place five stars after one visit. But a good looking crowd, fresh bread, food and beer all made from scratch plus a sound proof reinforced music hall only accessible from the bar makes this an instant hit in my book.
The quality of the food and beer was a cut above normal as was the service and the way they engage their customers."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars bc I love what they are doing beer wise. Very forward in terms of styles and the Bottle shop is awesome. Decor is nice and staff is friendly. Cool patio set up as well. Many complain the food is expensive. I agree it is priced a tad high for the area but it is fresh and seems very farm to table."}
{"text":"Went to see a band in the hall... Cool room... Sound was great... Limited capacity but very cozy and cool."}
{"text":"First of all, they need to fix the sound situation in here. It is too loud and can't focus/have a conversation in there. It's better to get the beer to go (also a lot cheaper). 
Overly Pricey food and beers if you stay. 

The music hall on the other side however, is a 5 star venue."}
{"text":"Much better experience last time I was here. Got to try all the food and the beers were much better ! Service was also very accommodating."}
{"text":"I like that the menu changes around. I feel like I am going to a new restaurant every time!
Service was good...maybe too good! There were at least 5 different staff members asking how we were, clearing, taking orders. There was always a fresh drink close by, which is good because this place is so busy.

It's hip, it's funky, it's fresh. It's the place you want to take your friends and family from out of town!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with sour dough bread. $8 for 2 slices of bread is a little bonkers. Besides that I'm a big fan. Great selection of flavorful beers and such. Good music, good atmosphere, great staff. Patio closes at 11:00."}
{"text":"I have held back my review on Burdock until I had time make my way through all their offerings.  I figured if you market yourself as a brew pub the quality of your product should at least have some factor in the overall rating!  

Capitalizing on recent trends on independent craft beer this place has kind of a trendy feeling restaurant with a small counter/bottle shop attached to the back.  I had some of the entry lvl offerings on tap like the blond and Saison Session Ale but wasn't impressed until I got home and had the Farmhouse Stout and West Coast Pilsner..  I will be grabbing a few more of these to share out with friends.

I am going to get past the beer and actually order some food next time I promise.  Some promising events were also on the calendar so check those out as well.."}
{"text":"I've come here for shows in their beautiful performance space, dinner with friends and popped by the bottle shop to grab a few drinks for the weekend.  This is by far the best brewery in the city.  They're doing fun and interesting things with flavors that go beyond just hops. Current fave is the Té sour. The food is also excellent and goes above and beyond typical brewpub fare."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday afternoon after work. The decor of the place was very hipster. They have seating both inside as well as patio seating.

I ordered some samples of the beer for about half the price/ amount. I really enjoyed their sour beers and saissons.

The brewery also makes bread and I tried their sourdough and beer bread with some pickled vegetables. Not a bit fan of the pickled stuff but the combination of the bread and beer was heavenly. They even gave us some more bread to go with the pickled stuff after we finished all of them. I have to say though, the food is a bit pricey for the amount you get. The beer prices weren't too bad.

They also have a bottle shop that is open from 11 am-11 pm that sells both their beer and bread."}
{"text":"Delightful little place near Dufferin station. They supposedly have live music, and were supposed to the night I went (as advertised on their site), but it didn't happen. I wasn't disappointed by this. Instead, we sat outside at the communal seating, and enjoyed food and drinks and caught up with friends.

I had this sweet beef dish. It was on the small plates menu and was super tasty. My partner had the Trout Tartine. I had the Alchemy Kombucha (which is non-alcoholic but delicious) and he had the peach berliner (super sour). Later our friend ordered the Sourdough Bread (which comes with a warm cheese to dip in) and a pear berliner (which is less sour).

Overall, I loved the atmosphere of the place. It's a great spot to catch up with friends (or take a tinder date!). It's getting colder now, so I don't see the patio being open for much longer, but it's just super cute. The service was wonderful, friendly and fast. It could be a stuffy place, however, it's just too laid back and casual to ever feel that way. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is alright, if a bit weird.

First, we noted how delicately and deliberately the place was appointed inside - beautiful tile, preciously built wooden patio - but then my companion pointed out how odd it was in contrast that the sticker chosen for the door to the bathrooms was one of those man/woman silhouette decals you buy at Home Hardware. Hipster irony or cracks in the surface?

We were here for an afternoon drink before early dinner, so asked for a spot on the patio. There were a few groups here, but still tables empty and tons of space. The next weird thing was that  the server could offer us only one stool. I wonder, do they try to fill this place up with standing people later in the evening, given that there's not even seating enough for all available tables? It's a style, I guess. And they do say sitting is the new smoking, so maybe that explains it. When a couple with a child came in, they worked a bit harder to accommodate the little one. We nabbed a second stool when another party left (we used to smoke, after all).

He had the IPA (12 oz, $7) and I had the Classic Nula sour (16 oz, $7.50). We enjoyed these. The 12 oz seemed to be served in a wine glass (quite thin glass). Our server obliged me with a wee taste of the Passionfruit Nula so I could compare the two, which was kind.

When we paid up we were surprised (and admittedly a bit disappointed) to see there's tax added onto the menu prices for these beers. So Burdock ends up being a lot pricier than most of the other tap-room bars around these parts. With all the oddities, I'd probably only head back here if I was in a pinch, or was coming to see a specific musical act in the attached event space."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The beautiful patio was so tempting on a warm summer night, but after we sat down, we were told (kind of rudely) that it was closing in 10 minutes and we had to go inside. After my friends and I went inside, it took about 15 minutes before someone came and acknowledged our presence. Service the whole evening was very slow for our very simple order. The acoustics of the space weren't great, so it felt louder than it actually was. Far better options in the area, in my opinion. We ended up at Wise Bar and the contrast in terms of quality of service and atmosphere was very stark."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and so hipster it hurts. Awful service. They act like they have something better to do than provide good service. Waitress pushed me out of the way and told me to watch where I was standing. I'm sure I was probably in a stupid spot,  but since when can a waitress give you snotty attitude like that? Grow up Burdock. Use your manners."}
{"text":"Very accommodating to vegans. Been happy with most of the meals I have had and they switch it up seasonally. The beer is great too. I like the mango Berliner that's on tap now."}
{"text":"Simple elements taken to a higher level. Those four kind of potatoes were creamy, the cheese gave a fresh flavourful contrast. I really enjoyed the harmony in this appetizer.

The beef of the tartar was good quality meat, it wasn't the classic dish, it had an interesting twist including crunchy nuts.

That time I didn't try the main dishes because we had lunch before (kitchen opens at 5). I want to go back, the food gave me the impression of been performed by a talented chef, plus I liked the decoration.

The cider they had on the menu was strong. They also have beer to go with cute bottles."}
{"text":"Lots of sour beer to choose from. Great ambiance for a date. Ok service. Also, there's a bottle shop on the side if you find a beer you like. 

I only had a sharing plate of pickled items that were quite sour with the beer. It was recommended by the bartender. Definitely keep that mind if you're thinking about ordering it!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, huge patio, great beers, OK food, subpar service."}
{"text":"The brews at this place have come a long way since I last visited a couple years ago. Tried a nice APA last night, then switched to their IPA. Was sad to hear the passionfruit infused beer had run out. Otherwise, they had an impressive selection of varied taps (all their own). Some sour beers, a lot of hop forward beers, a couple saisons, etc. Nice list overall.

Very nice interior, and a good room for live music as well. Lighting is appropriately dark in the music room, with a spotlight onstage which helps direct attention to the performers, and works to minimize chatter so you can focus on the bands. There was a dedicated sound person last night. Not sure if that's their own, or was brought in.

You will be served by lovely women that I imagine are semi-succesful aspiring actors, or working on their PhDs, or visiting from another country. There were no male staff working last night. 

My main issue with this place is the price. Simply put, it's far too expensive. \"Pints\" come in a 16oz glass. I'm sorry, but that's not a pint, and never will be. If I'm drinking a five percent beer at eight bucks a glass, please pour me a proper serving (18-20oz). It's insulting. Several of the stronger beers were served in 12oz glasses. Enjoy your beer that lasts five minutes. Furthermore, their house white is ten bucks a glass. Help a brother out! 

All in all, I appreciate the beer being made here, but it's not on the same level as Bellwoods (which it's clearly modelling after now). Adjust your prices accordingly to avoid alienating the neighbourhood. Otherwise, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Did a drive by stop here during a craft beer hop along Bloor for my partner's birthday. We started on the patio but then with the rain we moved inside. It was a bit dark inside for the three of us.

The decor was unique but the tables and chairs weren't very comfortable. Compared to the gorgeous patio, it wasn't as nice to hang out in. 

We ordered empanadas, sour dough bread and their IPA. It was all good but a tad over priced for the brews and a few slices of bread. 

The service was unmemorable. It might have been different if we went later in the evening or as a date night. 

Would come back if we're in the area but it definitely won't be our first stop for food/drinks."}
{"text":"Nice romantic decor inside. Quick service. The beer was eminently affordable and quite delicious. Tried the Hoppy Heffé and the Cider.

Also ordered the bread basket and had the best sour dough in a long time! Needed some more oil with it though.

Great place for a date or a catch up with an old friend."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, servers are nice.  Entrée took over 40 minutes. Cancelled our mains and left. We gave it a shot. Bread was burnt."}
{"text":"I only go to the retail store off topic the side. The beer itself has not disappointed, everything I get is pretty decent.

However, I seem to always leave disappointed cause of maybe bad timing.

I've been twice and each time they had beer that was a few hours from selling or like right on the table but not selling til they next day. And they were the ones that matched closest to my taste buds.

They refuse to sell it to me even though it's right there. And I understand why they won't, but I'm still disappointed. I can't make it here that often and when you can't get what you want even though it is available makes me sad."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it was disappointing. Worst craft beer I have ever tasted. Gave me a headache. 

The service was also lacking. I felt like our servers had something better to do than serve us although we did have one really great server who made up for the others. 

It's a hipster place. Looks great but lacks any real substance. I won't be going back here. 

ETA: The one redeeming thing about this place was the music. Great DJ the night we went."}
{"text":"Finally got to come here with my family last night. In house craft beer, food, music all sounded great  However my partner and I both feel cheated today and bummed about our experience. Food: overpriced, tiny portions.
$14 for 4 tiny cheeses, a tablespoon of compote, seeds and hard as hell ' bread' that had more holes than grains. We couldn't find anything reasonably priced on the menu. Beer: bland and over yeasted. We are both craft beer lovers and enjoy making the rounds of the local breweries. We can tell good from bad. 
When we ordered the drinks eventually server came back to ask about food, but forgot drinks. Eventually ordered wine to forget about overpriced food, and even that sat at the bar while the staff chatted. Good things about the Burdock, seating, decor and patio outside. Live music? It is in a separate room ( not a hall ) next door with a cover charge. Our hostess was nice, there were other small kids there ( although I am not sure what they ate ) and the recorded music was good. Love Fela Ransome Kuti but maybe not on a loop. Oh, there is no sign to let you know you found the place- is this a deliberate cool thing to do? 
Overall highly disappointed but I see potential if certain things were fixed. But it appears that the owners do not read reviews otherwise our experience would have been much better."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Creative menu. Lots of fun. 

Also, excellent wine list and recommendations. Great pricing."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place because of the positive BlogTO review. Our experience was not good. In fact, it's one of the sadder dining experiences I've had. Service was extremely slow even though it wasn't busy. 

We actually tried to make a reservation for a party of 4 as it was a Saturday night. We were informed that it wasn't necessary and that they would have \"space for sure\". That in itself should have been a warning. 

Apparently this place is known for its bread. Yet every piece of bread we tried was burnt and charred black. We had the bread and olive oil - burnt! Steak on bread appetizer - dry as hell and burnt! Basically every bite was the taste of, as Ralph Wiggum put it, \"burning\". 

We ordered our mains: 3 pork shoulders, a steak frites, and a roasted cauliflower to share (we were a party of 4). They forgot the cauliflower and I wish they'd have forgotten the rest of the food. The pork came with a side of kale and cabbage - it was sour to the point of inedible. Basically it was like the food was cooked by someone who never tasted it.

The pork itself was under-seasoned and bland. All you could taste was the dijon mustard slathered on. I threw in the towel after a couple bites. The meal is nicely summed up by Homer Simpson at the Chili Cook-off: \"A bland, timid entry - suitable perhaps for patients recovering from surgery.\"

My friends and I left hungry, with a taste of burnt toast in our mouths. So many mediocre places to eat in Toronto that are stellar in comparison. In a word: bad. NEXT!"}
{"text":"Burdock is a brand new bar/resto/microbrewery and music venue. Heard about it through a friend who is booking bands there and went by tonight. Really sweet spot, great atmosphere and delicious eats/drinks. 

Food wise there are a few mains - the steak frites beside our table looked amazing - but we were there for snacks/drinks so sunk into \"Dufferin Doubles\" (chickpea spicy greasy dough liciousness) and sampled the grilled cauliflower and Mennonite curried micro kernal popcorn (yes, tiny spicy yummy popcorn! Heirloom at that!). 

They have a select beer/wine menu. Friends were happy w the IPA and I with the cider. They just had brewing tanks installed and their passionate, resident brew master will begin concocting their own signature craft beer in the coming months.

The music venue room (separate from the main dining area) is acoustically designed for optimal sound and is a gorgeous space with warm lighting and wood panelled nooks for drinks. Looking forward to catching some show here in the near future. From what I heard, a welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The Burdock opened about six months ago.  Gord and I checked it out tonight.

They have a shop where you can buy beer to take home.

Their brewhouse is in the back.

We sat at the bar, which is in the middle of the restaurant.

They only serve their own beer.  Gord enjoyed their saisons and brought some Wet Hop Pale Ale home.

The staff obviously like each other ... they spent a lot of time hanging together.  As such, I wouldn't give them high marks for customer service (Sam was the most helpful and friendly).

This is the first brewpub I've been in that was upscale.  In addition to the food offerings being higher end, a DJ starting spinning tunes at 10pm.

I might stop in again if I was in the area but it wouldn't be a destination for me."}
{"text":"Fun place in Bloorwest and a nice addition to the community. Beer is tasty - I'm not a huge beer fanatic but I enjoyed the variety. The menu is a bit small and don't expect the usual pub food.

Plowman's Platter was good with nice mix of bread, pickled food and some relatively bland goat cheese (more like cream cheese), mushroom tartine was fine but not bursting w flavour and same with beet salad. All fine but nothing outstanding and the dishes we picked all had the same 'feel and texture' to them (ie slightly mushy, pickled, etc).

Would like to see a bit more extensive menu and a bit more work on flavour / seasoning. 

Live music in the music hall is great. Lovely space, great music and fair price - would absolutely go back there for a drink and music and skip the front of the house."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go to Burdock after reading some of Yelp reviews for this place, but I absolutely loved this place! My boyfriend and I were won over as soon as we walked in. The decor is lovely, it's not too crowded, and the servers are so nice! Our server was very helpful when it came to beer selection and the food was good. There was a show going on in the music hall and it sounded like a good time - we were going to head over to check it out but the band finished before we got a chance! I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Decent beer options, limited food menu, but all on the pricier end and not the greatest portions. Great spot when not very hungry and are only looking for a nice dark space and only want a drink. 

Next door they have a music venue that we plan to check out soon.....will review it once we do - buy the tickets in advance...about $4-$5 more at the door. 

P.S. they sell their bread & beers to go as well."}
{"text":"This place has a very laid back, welcoming demeanor. We sat at the bar and had friendly, charming service from...I wanna say Scott but that might not be right. I overheard the host say he was the general manager - and what a friendly GM he is. 

The food: 
We had the pakoras, some fries, the chorizo and the trout tacos. The food is more upscale than the vibe of the restaurant suggests, and generally it's delicious. We loved almost everything, especially the chimichuri that came with the chorizo. My one complaint is the menu didn't indicate the trout in the taco would be served raw. Because of this, I didn't eat it. Maybe I should have known and I just don't eat enough tacos. 
Then there's the beer. Burdock is a fun, local brewery and all their products deserve a taste. My favourite is the Té!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere . Overpriced beer. I paid 25 dollars for the most mediocre 750 mL's of craft beer ive ever had and ive been to every craft brewery in toronto. Lower your god damn prices or make a beer worth 25 dollars ,pick one."}
{"text":"My favourite new bar in Toronto. 

This place has everything you could ask for: excellent food (the bread alone is worth the price of admission), a solid beer selection, friendly service, great ambiance and decor, and a killer patio. Also awesome: concerts every night in the other room, kombucha on tap (!), clean bathrooms, veggie-friendly menu, conveniently close to the subway, and from the looks of it, they are opening their own brewery in the back. This place checks every box for me and has rapidly become my go-to when meeting friends on the Bloor line."}
{"text":"We waited a little bit longer than normal for service, which was absolutely fine because I'm a bartender and I get it. Take the rush with a smile. The male bartender was pouring beer like a pro. I was impressed. I could have sat there and watched him do his job for half of an hour. The beer was great, he was super kind and apologetic when he didn't have to be, and overall, we loved the place because of HIM."}
{"text":"The beer is good, if a little heavy on the sour options at the expense of porters, stouts, etc.

The food though is a joke. Okay maybe it's fresh or farm to table or whatever, but the portion-price ratio is laughable. A single scotch egg brought to a table of four people for $10? You can't fry one more egg for me there? Same thing with everything else ordered off the menu. Laughably small portions for the price.

Burdock needs to pull its head out of its ass and feed its patrons. Until then I'm not returning."}
