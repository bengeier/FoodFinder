{"text":"Very unexpected upscale ambiance in the heart of Henderson. Bruschetta and shrimp scampi were very good. Chicken parm was a bit bland. 

Overall, definitely recommend this little place."}
{"text":"Seven of us went to an early dinner.  We like to visit local places.  None of us will be returning.  The service was good.  The food was OK.  The rules were not.  No substitution without a charge.  In an Italian restaurant when ordering potato baked or rice was the side with chicken dishes.  Wanting to sub that for a side of pasta was told that would be 3.50 extra.  To change the side dish of penne pasta on another order to angel hair was also a 3.50 charge.  If you want to use 2 different credit cards a 1.50 charge for each card.  So if you go, don't plan on asking for any changes or for anything extra."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  The ambiance is intimate.  Would not take kids.  Its nice to go to a local fine dining restaurant away from the strip.  The waiters could use some common sense, but the food is amazing.  The owner comes and checks up and makes sure everything is going well."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a nice quiet dinner.

We were seated promptly and ordered some drinks. I had the house Cabernet and it was just fine. While we waited we checked out the decor. It is a small place, very cozy. Everything seemed clean and maintained, unlike a lot of other establishments in the area. The service was prompt and helpful.

For dinner, I had a Lamp Chop special and my wife had a Chicken Parmesan. The chops were cooked to my specification, and they were nicely seasoned. I'd order them again. My wife's Chicken Parm was an enormous portion, and it tasted a little plain, but I put that down to the fact that we ordered it without cheese. I'd not hold that against the place. The red sauce on it was tasty and plentiful.

For dessert we ordered a Cannoli and it was fantastic! 

Overall, this is a nice place and has some great food at reasonable prices. I'd recommend it for a romantic dinner, a family dinner, or for some quality Italian take-out."}
{"text":"Until last night, it had been about 2 years since we had eaten here. This was due to the poor service we had the last time - it was really that bad. That being said, I remembered how good the food was, especially the fettuccine alfredo. That being the case, the hubby and I decided to go back there last night. Wow. The problems that had been there before were nowhere to be seen. Service was quick, efficient, and friendly. The staff was professional. The food was still outstanding, and this time, we did get served within a reasonable amount of time. I had the alfredo, which I still think is the best in town. My husband had their eggplant lasagna special, which he also really liked. Great flavors - they don't skimp on garlic, which I love! This was a redemption visit for us and we were quite happy!"}
{"text":"First visit..very pleasantly surprised. .from a warm welcome. .everyone working there was friendly and did their job well...all the food was well prepared and simple very GOOD! ! Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for the last two years and loved it, but not this last time.  Fish over cooked, pasta over cooked, apple tart under cooked.  Way to much dressing on salad.  Vegetables and baked potato cold as ice.  We won't be back.  To bad because it was one of our spots.  Good luck."}
{"text":"We have used Emery's La Barrista catering and both events were outstanding!  Most recently, he catered a dinner for 17 people.  Everyone raved about the food, moreover, everyone loved Emery.  He greeted all of our guests, took coats and generally participated in the festivities, to include singing in the kitchen.  Emery is a warm, gracious man who provides wonderful food.  It doesn't get any better! Mary & Steve"}
{"text":"What a great time here. They took such good care of us for my ladies b day.
The foods was outstanding but the service was even better. If your looking for
Romantic and friendly experience Emery's is definitely the place to be.
Thank you again for such a wonderful Friday night.

{"text":"This place is wonderful!  We first went here on a Restaurant.com coupon.  We have been back at least 3 more times after that.  We always order the Seabass with Sherry Cream Sauce.  It's not on the menu but I always ask the chef for it when they have the Seabass.  The very first time we went there, they had the Seabass with Sherry Cream Sauce as a special menu item for that day.  We ordered it and fell in love with it!  The fish just melts in your mouth and the sauce is fabulous.  If you love Seabass, you must try it here.  We found out that the owners were chefs at one of the big casinos on the strip, and they decided to open their own restaurant.  We also ordered Calamari appetizer and their soup .  I can't judge on the other dishes but they looked really yummy on the other tables.  For sure, if you order the Seabass you won't be disappointed.  Like I said, we've been back there a few more times just for the Seabass, each time the dish was consistent, very fresh, and we loved it."}
{"text":"I stopped I with my wife to try this local restaurant.  I was very pleased!  The food was awesome, and the service was great!  I'm only sorry that I didn't stop in sooner."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the valley. My wife loves the German potatoes and I can never get past the fettuccine Alfredo."}
{"text":"I agree with the last reviewer. It's a little gem. The menu is very reasonably priced. Entrees include soup or salad and bread. I had a chicken dish that was tender and covered with a creamy mushroom sauce. It was great. The house salad was full of nice greens. The bruschetta was a little underdone, though. I could have been warmer and crispy. They did a nice job decorating. It was a small dining room, but not cramped. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"My fianc√© had veal marsala and i had the seafood diablo. Very good and fresh! The service was friendly and Emery his wife Brenda and Tiffany the waitress all were awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I was working in the area 3 years ago when I stumbled on this best kept secret. The atmosphere is nice, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the food is delicious!!! This is my preferred place to eat in the entire Las Vegas area. I love that it's not in a casino nor a strip mall.  Try this place. I recommend the specials. Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"We went before and the food was great, service was great, server was great. But this time, we service much slower than before, but was due partly to a catering job they had going on in a side room. You could tell that it was all family and friends as the wait staff invited some of them to the kitchen, then several times the chef came out and visited, this may be why our two entrees took 45 minutes to get when there was only one table of two waiting for food when we got there. Just to get our two side salads took 25 minutes from when we got there and we were the only ones waiting to order. The dressing on mine was wrong, again I'm sure that it was because of the family/friends catered party got all their attention.
I am giving it 3 stars instead of lower as I know from being there before how good it can be. I'd recommend that if you see a catered thing going, to turn around and walk out though as then if like for us, the service will be terrible and the meal bland. It was ok, but bland, not even salt and pepper I don't think.
Just not a good experience this last time when paying $25 a plate plus tax and tip. But like I said, the first time there was much better. Here's to hoping that they pay more attention next time to their regular customers while having a catered party."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is quiet, comfortable and cozy. If you would like a place to have a glass of wine and enjoy the best bruschetta in town. This is it. Support this small business today!"}
{"text":"I stopped in one evening during the last car show on Water St in Henderson. It was about 8pm we stopped in and were overwhelmed with awesome decor. More pretentious than amazing. I mean, the staff kicked out some kids that had to use the restroom. I can understand. My problems came when the waitress offered \"our special is Bud Light for a $1.50 or Sangria\". My wife an I got a total of 4 sangiras considering the great price. When my bill showed up, they had charged me $7 each glass instead of $1.50 each. I immediately brought this to her attention and she told me, \"it was her mistake\" but got defensive. I told her about the table who came in for a drink only and got the same \"shpiel\" and they looked happy when they left like they got charged $1.50 each. She disregarded it by saying, she'd fix my bill. When I got the revised bill, I still left a $2 tip for her courtesy. TIPPING IS NEVER A REQUIREMENT, NO MATTER HOW FANCY A RESTARAUNT! So, I left. I checked my account the next day and noticed I had a \"completed\" transaction for $55 and change which was exactly $20 over my original bill. I contacted the manager right away considering they just stole money from me and pushed my account negative. I told her why I was so livid and she addressed it with concern. She called me back after calling her merchant credit card processing company and said it was wrang up as $55 including tip. The original bill for everything was $35, plus $2 for tip which would have made it $37. The lady made up some bogus excuse and said that she didn't know what happened, even though her waitress must have forged my signature with an extra \"0\" in the bill. She said she'd refund the difference, we then hung up. 10 minutes go by and she calls me back saying that my card was declined and she couldn't charge it the right amount! I was furious, not to mention the negative balance fees I incurred that she never offered to fix or offered anything for me to return to the restaraunt as a guest again. So, the next day, I found I was reversed the charge and moved all of the money in my account to prevent her from doing this again. She called me back in the afternoon to tell me my card was declined again. I just told her that she could eat me ticket, and not to charge my card again or I'll report them for fraudulent activity to the City of Henderson. For all the headaches and stealing she took from me to make this restaraunt a definate skip. I wouldn't trust them with my food if that's how they treat their bills. Kitchen Nightmares needs a new season soon! Can I reccommend a place of cattyness, overly decored, overpriced food with bad customer service? And food is sub-par at best, Olive Garden has more Italian than this hole in the wall. They say they cater, but I've never seen their vans leave the parking lot. Definate skip, but don't trust me, try it yourself and prove me wrong! Look for the empty parking lot and your there! Considering 7-11 gets a fuller parking lot during slow hours, that should give you an idea."}
{"text":"Came here due to $25 off from restaurants.com.  food was ok, nothing I would rant and rave over. The lasagna was very cheesy and warm, my mom ordered the chicken picatta, which she said was good, but very cold. 
Service was TERRIBLE!  Our waitress NEVER came back to our table after taking our order, so the busser was the one to deliver the food, and then she never came back, so my mom got stuck with cold chicken. It was ok, good to try, but not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"As I was looking for a caterer in Henderson for my Dads Celebration of life, I ran across Emery's. However, there were very few ratings on the actual catering side of their business. I have eaten in the restaurant a few times and I thought I'd go with them. Let me tell you. I am So Happy I did!! The food was Amazing! The service was on time, wonderful and the setup, Beautiful. I would Highly recommend Emery's for Any event. Every morsel of food was eaten, and the guests Loved it.
Thank you So much Emery and Brenda for making our Dad's Celebration of life even More Special. Much Love and Respect,   The Dyes"}
{"text":"What a great discovery for local Henderson as they are located at the south end of Water Street! Great ambiance, good service and food of ample portions to share."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch: most items on the lunch menu are under ten bucks. Frank Sinatra played continuously, a bit loud at first; but I walked in right at the opening of 11am so I guess the staff like Old Blue Eyes at high volume when noone's around.

Had the \"Redevelopment Club\" club sandwich. Now, normally I shy away from lunch meat, as I'm told it's bad for you, but I think there's room in my diet for this sandwich! Bread was great, basil mayo was great, and the ham/turkey/bacon was great.

And normally, I shy away from shoestring fries, but the fries were damn tasty.

The dinner menu looks pretty reasonably priced -- most dishes under $20, and they have a long wine selection.

EDIT: note the unusual hours: dinner is Thu/Fri/Sat only, lunch is Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu only."}
{"text":"I love EMERY's!!!!!!!!! Anytime we're in town we come to Emery's! We love it so much we actually has a small wedding reception at the restaurant! The food was wonderful and there was so much of it. Our guest still talk about how wonderful the food was! The staff are wonderful! We can't say enough about how wonderful Emery and his wife are! They were amazing! Back to the food.......all I can say is that when it comes to Italian food I'm super critical, but the food here was amazing and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs, a staple Italian dish.  Meatballs were on the bland side.  Spaghetti sauce kinda tart.  
Gave it a C-"}
{"text":"We decided on Italian cuisine this evening, but we also wanted to pay tribute to our local mom and pop eateries in the Downtown Henderson, Water Street district so Emery's it was.

Upon being seated we asked our not so fluent in English server for a wine list...No wine list along with no explanation until we inquired with another service professional walking by our table.  It was explained to us that since the wine list was outdated, they did not have a wine menu at all. Seems simple to just update something and have it printed but I suppose what is simple for some may not be simple for others?

We requested a bottle of house Cabernet but instead received two glasses to start instead.  The bottled of wine arrived shortly, unlike our food.

In good company and enjoying a bottle of \"house\" Cabernet, we were more than halfway through before we noticed everyone else being served before us.  Pasta, steaks, chicken, it didn't matter the entree ordered or the time in which people were sat AFTER us; our meals were never served.

54 minutes and one bottle of wine later we decided it was time to hit the road and find a dining establishment that would actually serve our meals.  We let our server know we were interested in paying our wine tab but not interested in our meals still currently on order. The waiter quickly went to the kitchen to relay the message to the cook (who turned out to be the Owner).  We were shortly approached in a confrontational manor by the proud owner of Emery's asking why we were leaving and not planning on waiting longer for our food. As I felt the tensions rising, I waived for my guest to head to the car, I stayed behind to defuse the situation..

Wow, the owner of a restaurant causing conflict with it's patron?! Interesting.. this situation merely reiterates my previous statements of service gone bad in this city."}
{"text":"Great Henderson local spot. A mom & pop place with great people! The menu is great and reasonably priced. The server talked me into the German potatoes and they were amazing! A must place to visit for  Henderson locals!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night. I ordered the Sea Bass special. I am a oenophile but I was unimpressed with the wine list. For an Italian restaurant, there were very few Italian wines on the menu. There were no Barolos or Barbarescos and only one mid level Chianti. The wines were priced at 3 - 4 times retail. I decided on a cocktail instead. I ordered a Manhattan. I neglected to say \"up\" and it was delivered over ice in a high ball glass with a lemon peel instead of a cherry. I apologized and asked for the Manhattan \"up.\". The drink came back in the same high ball glass with lemon sans ice. 

The Sea Bass, when delivered, was about three ounces and very soggy. I did enjoy the Caesar salad. The small scoop of German potatoes were good but small. The waitress handed me the bill at the same time she asked me about dessert or coffee. I declined.

I live in the neighborhood and was hoping for a good go-to Italian restaurant. I will have to go farther afield next time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. The service: 5 stars. Very attentive, polite & genuine. The food: Started out amazing with REALLY good clam appetizer & really tasty side salads. My husband's lamb chops with mint jelly were really good too. But the lobster ravioli (special) for $27 was pretty disappointing. The sauce wasn't very good & the ravioli wasn't impressive. Dessert: tiramisu was decent. Decor wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I was imagining a more romantic type of vibe but the bright pink paint wasn't my thing. Only one bathroom that is for both male & females. All in all, I'd go back."}
{"text":"the servers are rude especially if you are dining alone. the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is the first time I enter this establishment for dinner.  I have heard it was good and that it was.  We were out for an early dinner and glad we decided on Emery's.  First of all I really enjoyed the small quaint atmosphere, quite with a home town Italian d√©cor.  Italian works on the walls and many bottles of wine out for show. If they would have been playing Italian music I would have been back in Italy.  The staff was prompt and friendly.  We ordered our drinks and decided what we were going to eat.  After the order was taken we were brought a half a loaf of warm bread which had a great flavor with garlic butter on the side.  We started with an appetizer, the special they had, crab and shrimp.  We were brought cold crab claws and large shrimp, big enough you had to eat each shrimp in at least 2 bites.  For our entree's, my wife had the Chicken Alfredo and I had the Linguini and clams in a white wine sauce.  My wife enjoyed her dish enough to eat her left over later that night.  I really enjoyed mine, the Linguini was done perfectly, almost al dente, which is how all the meals were as we experienced in Italy last year.  There were plenty of minced clam to accompany clams in the shell.  I ordered mine with extra garlic which was done with no problem.  It was just as I hoped it would be.  Hot buttery-garlic with an occasionally a crunch of sand, (that is how I know they use fresh clams).  I wish I had more room left to try one of their desserts.  Maybe next time.  This is a place I will visit again when I want fresh Italian food."}
{"text":"Yuck. 

My husband and I went here for a date - trying out something new. At the end of the date we had both wished we hadn't. 

To start - the location is cool, I am a fan of water street. But the inside of the restaurant looks like someone is really into going to garage sales and just keeps piling up crap upon crap upon crap to decorate. It's terrible! There are more decorations in that one little room than there is in an entire knick knack shop! Also, the big statue in front - creepy. Not cute. 

The bathroom decor is super confusing, signs for love, and then on the opposite wall old advertisements for beverage flavorings...What???

Alright lets move on to the staff. Our waitress, was terrible. We had told her it was our first time and she didn't care to introduce us, explain anything, NOTHING. It was our first time ordering and she offered a side that neither one of us understood and after thinking that she explained it my husband just decided to order the pasta. 
She never checked on us once throughout the entire evening. We got more attention from the bus boy and the hostess. 

Onto the food....the bread appetizer, was the BEST part. And I'm pretty sure I've purchased the exact same loaf of bread at Albertsons, on many, many occasions. I ordered the chicken penne, when it came out the sauce was SUPER thin and there was tons of water and oil in the bottom of my dish. It was disgusting. The taste was non-existant. My husband ordered the chicken parmesan. The breading of the chicken was soggy, someone does NOT know how to prepare chicken parmesan. Someone had DUMPED marinara sauce onto the chicken. Once again - disgusting. 

Everything tasted frozen, pre-bought, and canned. For the price I could have made 100x better than either what I OR my husband had ordered. It seems as though the chef doesn't care about his or her food. 


We will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"I love checking out new places, and Yelp has helped me find some real gems. I have had Emery's on my radar for a bit... but the reviews on Yelp seems to be a bit all over the place, with almost every review being either 5 star or 1 star. So I refrained from visiting until this past weekend. My husband wanted to take me to a new place, and he loves Italian food, so we went to Emery's Saturday evening for dinner.

We started out with iced teas and an order of the bruchetta. I noticed there was a birthday party in the next room, and I hope that it would not impact the service we received. Thankfully it did not, our drinks were never empty and our appetizer came out quickly. 

For dinner, my husband had linguine with marinara sauce and I went with one of the specials for the evening, lobster ravioli. We both got dinner salads with our meals, and my husband added on a bowl of soup. 

Salads and the soup came out first, and again it was fairly quickly. The salads were basic, with a nice balsamic vinaigrette dressing. My husband was not thrilled with the pasta fagioli soup. He said it was clearly homemade, he just prefers a thicker soup. He would not pay the $5 to add on either the soup or salad again. 

We were both very pleased with our entrees. My lobster ravoli was stuffed with large chunks of lobster and the pasta was obviously freshly made that evening. My husband's linguine was also freshly made and the marinara sauce was deliciously seasoned. We finished our evening off with an order of tiramisu to go. 

I am so glad I did not let the bad reviews of Emery's keep me away any longer...  We didn't experience any of the issues mentioned in the bad reviews. Our server was friendly and food came out in a reasonable amount of time, considering we could both see and taste that the pasta was freshly made that night (which takes time). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best little gem of a restaurant in Henderson!!Quaint and hidden in down town henderson off water street..The food was absolutely amazing and fresh! Met the owner and chatted with her a bit..really loved the one on one family feel of this place! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It is a cute establishment but quality to price does not match up. The waitress did not like that I had brought my children and she was very hesitant to wait on us. The bread was extremely hot when brought to the table but got cold quick and became very hard to chew. The kids had an \"adult\" portion of spaghetti and meatballs which only can with two very medium to small meatballs. I had the shrimp savoy in which the flavors were not their. The mushrooms saut√©ed in wine were bitter, there was too much butter, the shrimp were flavor less (but on the plus side large), and it lacked salt. Needless to say I will probably not return which is sad because \"old\" Henderson needs good eating establishments."}
{"text":"I came with a Restaurant.com $25 gift certificate in my hands and I had read the not-so-stellar reviews here on Yelp, but when my husband and I entered this quaint establishment on a Saturday evening around 6:30 PM I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small dining area with bright colors and Italian-esque decorations covering the walls. There's a bunch of wine lining the back walls and only about 10 white-clothed tables. I have to admit I was comparing it to my favorite Italian place in town, which is in Downtown Las Vegas called Chicago Joe's. There's similarities and differences.

To start off with I ordered a glass of raspberry iced tea, my husband, sweet tea. The tea was deliciously sweet. Next we were served some nice, warm bread, about half a loaf with some delicious garlic butter. The butter was perfectly spreadable. The bread, although a bit tough on the outside, was still good. We were offered a second helping, but we declined. 

I ordered the Linquine Clams with a red sauce. When I inquired as to whether or not the red sauce had a little spice, I was told it did not have any spice, but the waitress asked me if I would like the cook to make it spicy and I said yes! So that was very nice of my waitress to cater to my desires. My husband ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo and we both opted for House Salads with Ranch dressing. 

The salads came out with very green leaves, shredded carrots, a few tomatoes, and a couple slices of sweet onions. In comparing this salad to the one at Chicago Joe's - this salad wins. Definitely a better variety of green lettuce leaves and a bit fresher in my opinion. 

Next our entrees arrived. They plate their pastas in bowl-like boat plates. They were hot and fresh, my red sauce had just the enough amount of kick to my liking. What I enjoyed a bit more about this Linquine Clam over Chicago Joe's is that there were actual clam shells with meat along with clam meat actually dispersed throughout the pasta. I think the addition of clam shells gives the dish a nice, rich oceanic flavor. It is nice to dig out the clams and get that bit of sea taste.

My husband noted that his pasta was very good, but I did not try any because I was slurping up my own. We ended up taking home leftovers and declined desert because we had a fresh pie waiting for us at home to eat.

Overall the food is A+. There's no doubt about the authenticity of whoever is cooking here. The atmosphere is nice, the music was not too loud, and it is a family/casual dining experience. Service was great from our main waitress. The woman who brought us out our drinks and bread was a bit cold, but nothing so much to ruin our experience.

I would certainly go back, especially if I happen to be in the Henderson area and I am craving Italian. The plus side here is that you are supporting a local mom and pop business as well. I would and will continue to gladly fork over my money to places like this over Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill."}
{"text":"I got the salmon and it was amazing! My husband got veal Parmesan and he liked it a lot! The service is great too and very fast  we loved it!"}
{"text":"Went again early January.  I cant get away from that delicious pasta dish I get with the Shrimp and a creamy white sauce..  I always get it with mushrooms and make it spicy!  The server knows which one, its one of the more popular dishes I think..  It's with out fail.. ALWAYS the same!!  I love consistency when going to restaurants.  Salads are always fresh, bread just ok, I wish they made there own bread, I'm sure it would be amazing just like the food.. But I knows it's too much work.  I do wish the wine selection was better :(  but none the less, the food here is so authentic and wonderful, we will just get our buzz on down the street at Lovelady Brewery :)"}
{"text":"Come for the DRINKS ONLY!
 I didn't have the heart to tell the extremely polite waitress Tiffany the food sucks! 
Chicken Angelo $17 canned mushrooms, canned artichokes drowning in blah sauce with crappy olives. (In my opinion GOOD olives have pits)
Lasagna in a BOWL? my grandmother would of smacked someone. We thought MAYBE our kids would eat it?  Nope they took this picture of grease pouring out. 
Tiramisu to go. Not so bad at all.  That gets 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! The lasagna is to die for!! Very friendly staff and an enjoyable experience overall. Other dishes we tried and loved: chicken fettuccine, German potatoes, tiramisu and cheesecake. Emerys is a valued treasure in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"I treated my friend here for her birthday dinner. She chose the place as it is close to both of us and we both had not tried it out before and thoroughly enjoy trying out new places. It is very cute and tiny. There seems to be a little shop located next to it and it also has limited dining hours. The people dining there that night consisted of small families and there was one man eating alone. Our waitress wasn't overly friendly or pleasant, but she did the job just fine. We loved the quaint environment and how it felt like home dining there. The food was very good. Lots of Italian dishes made with great authenticity. I had a pasta dish and she had the eggplant which tasted good and we both had a couple glasses of wine. This restaurant is a great local spot to try out if you aren't into overrated restaurants or chain-like restaurants - definitely a noteworthy mom and pops local business - which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time we have eaten here the food has been great. Hot fresh made. Warm staff. One of the best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at, I've  been to many. Clean boyfriend has seen many restaurants and is very happy with the cleanliness of the restaurant. A must try."}
{"text":"My husband and I were super excited to try this place since it's only a few blocks from our house, but we were thoroughly disappointed with every aspect of the experience.

The waitress who greeted us was cold and unwelcoming, and failed to mention that it was happy hour until I specifically asked her.

We ordered two glasses of wine which per the happy hour special afforded us a free cheese \"tray\". The Pinot Grigio tasted like a Chardonnay and the Riesling tasted like Apple juice. The cheese tray was 9 dice sized cubes of less than average cheese and two bundles of grapes. 

We also ordered a caprese salad, which was comprised of cardboard out of season tomatoes, regular mozzarella cheese (not bufula as advertised) and topped with lettuce dressed with Italian dressing. 

The complimentary French bread was dried out and uninspiring.

No part of our meal was enjoyable or inviting. We could have made infinitely better food at home and not have wasted $35 for two terrible glasses of wine, a cheap cheese plate, and a sorry salad.

Will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"We had the crab cakes for an appetizers.  Amazing!  Manicotti special was delicious and can't forget the yummy cheesecake.  Nice family restaurant.  Staff was very nice.  we will definitely be bringing family, friends and colleagues here."}
{"text":"My dine-in experiences have been mixed but their catering is great.  I like the usual pasta fare that Emery's seems to have down to a science of tasty like the Spaghetti and Meatballs. Super YUM.  but I like my burgers a little more...I don't know...shuh-pow...I like burgers to thrill me and these were good so no complaints but they weren't great.  But what am I doing ordering burgers in an Italian joint?"}
