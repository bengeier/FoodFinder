{"text":"Love their coffee. I go out my way to come here as I live in the deep south. However this last occasion caused me to pause. I asked the cashier how she was today. She ignored me and went on with her conversation with the barrista.  After a few mins she then took my order and said she was having a good day. Picking up my coffee when it was yelled out that it was ready, I was greeted by no response when I said thank you.... call me old fashioned.  Money is tight right now. Time for Starbucks Coffee not so good service exceptional. .."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I was without an office for the summer due to the floods and this place has become a second home.  Their lattes are fantastic and they take pride in their coffees.  They also have great beer and Boylans.  The best thing could be the light though.  Even on a cloudy day, the place is bright great to sit in."}
{"text":"Great pastries and very strong coffee. Free wifi and it's usually fairly quiet so a perfect place to read or study."}
{"text":"Met some of the girls who worked at Postino at Yelp's In the Swing Of It event. They were serving some tasty Phil and Sebastian 15 Kilo coffee there, and were super knowledgable and friendly.  My boyfriend and I decided to stop there, post Kijiji haul. We were promptly greeted by a friendly young lady behind the counter. We ordered Americanos, so its all I can comment on in this review, and no suprise, they were perfect. We sat at on of the high tables by the massive windows that take up almost all sides of the cafe, and spent an hour chatting, the ladies not even once giving us that \"you've been here too long\" stink eye you sometimes get at more bustling cafes. The decor is very simple and industrial. The light is great for the many students they are inevitably looking to entice from the UofC. Im not sure if I can really grasp the \"lounge\" description....maybe because they serve beer? When Im in the area again, I'll be popping by to try one of their delicious looking pastries with my coffee."}
{"text":"Finally a coffee shop in the NW that serves up a great espresso !  The shot was bright and balanced.  Latte was well done and up to the same standards as any of he downtown shops.   They are serving P&S and Bows and Arrows coffee.  Also had a nice breakfast wrap. This will become a regular stop on they way to work."}
{"text":"Went to Postino's and finally found a great place to have a coffee and socialize. It's really close to the university and is also popular with the locals. It's now my regular hang out. Great service and coffee and they really take care of their customers. A real \"boost\" !"}
{"text":"This is a really nice cafe that just opened.  Staff are super friendly.  Coffee is great, and they even have some good beer!  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Bad customer service from the big lady on the counter! Rude and no customer service skills. AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE ... NO WIFI. I asked why wifi isn't working .. she said owner has been trying for months to fix it but they cant. I offered to have access to the router so i can help fix it for good! But she was rude and not giving a damn. I left my tea there .. A note to the owner and promised myself to never go back to that place. I especially asked when i came in .. Do u have wifi?! Answer: yes. I ordered .. Sat down .. And at my surprise nothing. A waste of my time! That is the worst 5$ investment i made in a tea in my life. Oh well, if you never try .. You'll never know! 5$ experience got me to know this bad spot.   UPDATE: a week after .. The owner never called! That confirms that this business, owner and their culture is 'Dollar sign' driven NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE DRIVEN. Congrats ... Everyone knows now ;)"}
{"text":"Postino is a quality coffee shop close to the University and McMahon. If you're into frequenting the cool inner-city coffee shops of 17th Ave, Postino might just be up your alley. Actually, if you're looking for anything that isn't a Starbucks or a Tim Hortons in the area, Postino might just be up your alley.   It's easy to see from Crowchild but a little harder to get to. Turn left onto 24th and take your first two lefts to loop back to Postino. There is a small lot and some street parking.  The coffee is delicious, the food is worth buying and large window walls let in lots of light. All there missing is something to make it a little more cozy. The wood, steel and concrete all look great, but I'd sure love something soft to sit on."}
{"text":"This is a Phil and Sebastian spot by University!! A great spot to get some work done. Staff are friendly and it's not too busy either  so get here be the word spreads.   I have the mocha coffee and love it! It's smooth, lush and mellow - unburnt!! Only reason I didn't give it 5stars is because I have not tried anything else. Will update when I experience more of what Postino offers.   So far it's been a great experience!  P.S the red chairs are as comfy as they look. For those who want to get work done you have been warned"}
{"text":"the inside is neat and the coffee is quite good, it's got a unique taste to (I'm just having a boring old brewed coffee cuz that's how I roll). the woman working is quite unfriendly though and I hope if I come back it's someone different, someone a bit more welcoming."}
{"text":"When I need a break from my usual inner city coffee shop hangouts, I hop in my car and head on over to Postino across from the university. It's in the base of that newer building on the NE corner of Crowchild and 24th Ave that's been empty for what seems like forever!  It's simple in its decor, letting the large windows on nearly all sides of the cafe brighten the room. There's one larger table, a few 2 seaters and a high counter along one of the windows to take a seat. The tables are stylish, but the tops slant inwards towards the middle of the table which I find a bit odd. It's not as pronounced on the larger table, I notice it most on the 4 seater.  Anyway, tables aside, it's a great spot to stop in and work on your latest blog post while you sip your favourite coffee and one of the yummy muffins or perhaps to meet a friend in the area for a sandwich. I'm told the cafe has hopes of expanding the menu to include more nibbles for an evening crowd as they grow.  Expect a smile and warm greeting when you walk through the door, your very own jug of water if you're there for awhile (without even asking! Every table received one last time I popped down!) and a relaxing space to enjoy your time solo or with company."}
{"text":"While it's a nice place, the tin seats and bare cement floor are a bit cold and sterile. The drink prices weren't anything special, compared to other cafes.  The cappuccino's were good, but the coffee was revoltingly sour and bitter. Not just after one cup, but over the space of weeks of trying it.  To add insult to injury, there is only the one brew on offer, so it's that or something other than coffee.  Note to the owners: get coffee cups for the coffee, don't use latte bowls.  The coffee goes cold too fast.  The tea selection was good, but it's let down by not having the option of a refill, like any other cafe."}
