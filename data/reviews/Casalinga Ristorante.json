{"text":"What's the point of making a reservation if you wait 30 minutes and then be forced to split your party up? Food was excellent. Poor management it seems."}
{"text":"A busy local spot with great food and service.   Call ahead, it fills up quickly.     The menu has some great favourites and there are always some tasty specials.  Solid Italian wine list, fairly priced.  They have an excellent pizza oven as well."}
{"text":"I love the food at Casalinga! Authentic Italian. I usually get the Quattro stagione pizza and mezze plate to share. Both are fantastic. Good wine selection as well.   The only complaint I would have is that it is quite loud and service is inconsistent - sometimes I feel like I've been well attended to, other times I feel like I'm being ignored."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best authentic italian restaurants in Mississauga. What a gem. The food is fantastic, and they do takeout as well - for when you get that craving for some pasta at home. Sometimes I call them with an idea of what I want (even if it's not on their menu) and they always make it for me, no questions asked.  Note: The restaurant is tiny so make sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"Planned a valentines dinner for my family tonight. Today they had 3 sittings. 4 6 and 8 pm. One month ago booked a table for 5 for 8 pm. We wanted to sit and enjoy the meal.Food was good but the service was awful. We ordered appetizers. The hostess took the order and asked us to choose the main meal as it takes time to prepare. The appetizer was served and immediately the main meal was served. Total time from sitting 17 mins. Disappointed as we all dressed up and wanted to sit and enjoy the evening. We  decided not to eat desert there as the server came to pick up the check three times. The restaurant was not busy. Half the tables were empty.  We had Bruschetta,cesar salad .verdure pizza and penne casalinga  ,ravioli primavera . The portions were good size but the taste was nothing exceptional . For this Valentines the service was poor. For regular customers all ladies were given a red rose. For our ladies nothing.  Tonight this restaurant was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food! The portions were fabulous. Service was great! It was busy when we came but were seated promptly. Though there werent a lot of servers, the two gentlemen were exquisite. Delicious food waiting for the city to experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Mississauga hands down! I have been going here regularly since its opening. I have been to Italy a number of times, and this is the most authentic Italian cuisine you will ever find. The owner Mario is originally from Florence, where he used to run his restaurant business. He is a nice guy. The food is amazing quality. Service is great too! It will make you feel like you are in Italy for a few hours. You must experience Casalinga!  Grazie."}
{"text":"Another one of those special finds - small restaurant in a small mall but what food !!!! Real Italian and great tasting everything. Not a lot of room so make a reservation - you will want to try everything on the menu - sit back and close your eyes and you could be in the village restaurant in your favourite Italian village."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, mussels are to die for. Service is fast and simple. Small restaurant so make sure to reserve before going."}
{"text":"This place is small, but on point. Bring anyone who knows real Italian food here with confidence. Their pizzas are authentic. Everything is authentic. Just make sure you reserve in advance as it's very small."}
{"text":"This place has great authentic Italian food. I got one of the features that included rack of lamb & gnocchi in a pomodoro sauce which was delicious. My boyfriend got a menu item - pollo piccate which was also really good. We both had the tartufo for dessert which was excellent! The place has a casual and cozy feel."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for great meals, great service and a wonderful atmosphere for years and it remains one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Casalinga is a fantastic restaurant - my first choice in Mississauga for a nice dinner out. Went last week to celebrate a birthday and was not disappointed - my bf and I each had an amazing pasta (his gluten free), salads, and a crème brulee that was perfect. The service at Casalinga is always excellent and they go out of their way to treat you like family and make your experience special. The seating is a bit tight, hope they will expand soon since it's a great business!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the real deal - real Italian food. The waiter was incredibly nice. I ordered the bruschetta to start. I am not the biggest fan of tomatoes but this bruschetta was so incredibly good. The ingredients tasted fresh. The balsamic vinaigrette was aged and complemented everything on the dish. I then had an item from the specials menu - the butter and sage ravioli. The pasta melted in your mouth. It tasted like real pasta - not the dried aged stuff that you get at the supermarket. All-in-all it was an amazing dinner. I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Being Uruguayan and wanting to keep with the tradition of \"El dia 29\" aka \"El dia del ñoquis,\" I came across this cute place surfing the internet for a place to eat gnocchis. From the outside, the place looks like a small joint crammed into a corner unit of a plaza but looks can be deceiving. Once you walk in, the restaurant is beautiful. Bright with light and some fine looking people. ;) Had a bottle of red wine (can't recall the name of the deliciously sweet wine) to accompany the great tasting dish of gnocchi al ragu."}
{"text":"We happened to be in Mississauga and was looking for a good restaurant for lunch. A friend of mine recommended this place and we were very pleased with the quality of the food and service.   Our usual go-to Italian restaurant is Terroni in downtown Toronto. Since we are in a suburb, we were not expecting much from this restaurant but the pasta was cooked to perfection.  Perfect al dente pasta and their pollo pizza had a very generous amount chicken.   We are not usually around this area so we are not sure when we will be back next but will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good Italian restaurant in the Mississauga area."}
{"text":"Had Valentines Day Dinner here. After telling the waitress that we did not want wine, she treated us quite poorly. We were rushed through our dinner. Entrees were brought out 20 minutes after we arrived and appetizers basically showed up with our dinner when we specifically asked for them to be separate.   The women at our table did not get the complimentary roses we were promised at the beginning of the night.  The food was excellent but the service was very poor."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and service are both amazing! Definitely our favourite spot as we return again and again! Don't forget to order the soup!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Made reservations here because it was on a Insauga list and it's been a while since I've had some fresh gnocchi.  Alas after arrival I didn't order the gnocchi because the other dishes all looked so good too. We ordered the grilled veggie and goat cheese pizza and their Casalinga pasta (chicken, spinach, mushroom creamy penne) with a beer and glass of wine.  The wine was good and chilled and they had hop city which is nice.   The pasta came out first and was conveniently split into 2 plates for us because the server heard we were sharing. That was great service. Chili oil for the table with lots of parm on top. The pasta was al dente and the sauce and ingredient were finger licking... fork licking good? We even used the pizza crust to wipe up the sauce.  The pizza was top with lots of fresh veggies and goat cheese. It was a good size and nice thin crust.   I would definitely come back for the food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a strip mall and doesn't get the attention it should. We've been there two times and both of the times, the food and the service was excellent.  I asked for a vegan dish and they were more than happy to make it for me, tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Food was 3-3.5 but the service bumped them up to a 4 :)  I booked a table for 4 online - I do recommend making reservations since the restaurant is pretty small.   I called later to confirm if it would be OK for me to bring a cake since we were celebrating my mom's birthday - was told no problem. I ended up deciding not to bring the cake (relevant later in review).  2 of us ordered margherita thin crust pizzas, the other 2 ordered salmon.    Margherita pizza: they weren't kidding about thin crust. This is hands-down the thinnest crust I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's also the least cheese I've ever had on a margherita pizza. I've seen a couple other 'authentic' Italian restaurants in Mississauga/Oakville also skimp on cheese and don't really understand why - I went to Italy a few years ago and didn't experience this.   Salmon: I didn't try but it looked appetizing - one person was a fan, the other wasn't.   We asked for the bill and to my surprise, they brought in a slice of lemon cake with a candle for my mom. I guess when I called, they made a note for 'birthday' on my reservation and since I didn't bring a cake, they gave us a slice! So all in our all, our dinner ended on a good note :)"}
{"text":"It is a small and cozy restaurant with good food. Wine glasses too expensive at C$10.50. Friendly staff. Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a bit hard to find and small. The service was down right rude and admittedly some of it was our fault. 4 people out a expected party of 10 didn't show up and the waiter didn't hesitate to show his anger over this issue as he claimed he had turned away business due to the no shows .... hard to tell if this was true as I saw at least 3 empty tables but the place is busy as it is a local neighborhood hangout. In addition most people who came were vegetarians and non-drinkers so it wasn't going to be a huge bill.... trust me waiters notice things like this but usually most professionals have the courtesy to keep their displeasure in check... not so here.   Anyways it's all about the food right ? The bruschetta  and house wine was ho-hum.  They also brought my starter at the same time as my pizza.  The pizza ... the REAL DEAL ! As authentic wood burning stove pizza as I have in a while and real surprise. I had the Napoli it was crispy and good with just the right amount of anchovies (I'm not veggie).  Skip the attitude and go for the pizza."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and it was more than perfect! High quality food, shouting with taste and well-priced. The owner, Mario, was on the premises to insure everything was tutto posto!  The wood over pizza was full of taste and the bottom was perfect; cruncy but not hard. The linguine e vongole clams were literally a clam in each forkful. The pasta was elegantly lightly bathed in a suburb oilo aglio basilico sauce but I must stress, never have I experience so much suttle flavor in the dish. The insalata verde was plentiful and again, the dressing was created by an artist and it also lighly bathed the green leaves, red tomatoes, and cucumbers. The bread served on the table was a delight to dip in the 100% virgin olive oil. Lastly the meats and deserts wete plentiful and flavorful. I was back in Firenze at Trattoria Tito. They do offer a nice wine selection but because I dont drink, I ended my meal with a bottle of red bitter soda over ice with lemon. It was so good we made a reservation for tomorrow night. But make a reservation, Casalinga puts all the other pretend italian restaurants, like Goodfellows, to shame. Enjoy a fantastic evening with your love ones and feast here. Service was very competent and friendly. *****"}
{"text":"It may be small and innocuous, but the food is rich in flavour, the atmosphere relaxed and it makes the experience so enjoyable.  It is clean and accessible.  The price is right."}
{"text":"As a group of 10, we came for a birthday celebration on a Monday. It was busy and packed at one point. The restaurant is not that big and is at a corner of small plaza. Our table was at the back which was great as we were a fairly large group for the size of the restaurant. As we arrived, we were greeted promptly and we got water pretty quickly. The menu has good variety, just enough and not overwhelming. They have their specials listed on the back wall so be sure to check those out. Word of caution, their soup is big- so I would recommend sharing. For that evening, the special was broccoli potato (non-cream based), it was a puree and tasted delicious. I would definitely come back for their soups.  For the entrees, all of us either got a pasta or pizza (thin crust). I got the Pasta Casalinga, which was a Penne with a white wine cream sauce, chicken, mushrooms, and spinach. The sauce was perfectly done; not too heavy just right. The other pasta dish I would recommend is their seafood linguine- it is a huge dish and everyone who ordered it seems to enjoy it. I had a tiny bite of the pizza and the texture of the crust is great.  Service was great, we got water refilled in a timely manner and they were attentive. The bill did not take long. We were definitely the not so usual big group on a Monday night, but thumbs up- great job!  The birthday girl is a fan of Italian, and this place does a awesome job. Truly authentic."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here tonight, and am already wanting to go back again! The food is so fresh and flavorful, and I highly recommend the risotto ala pescatore. The sauce was delicious and the seafood was well cooked and fresh. Everyone in my party enjoyed what they ordered, and we all ordered different things. I recommend making a reservation though before you arrive, as the restaurant is quite small with limited seating."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and this is a fantastic restaurant! Food is delicious and authentic. I love the pasta, and I usually get the penne alla vodka or penne Casalinga. The pizza is thin-crust and delicious. Friendly service too"}
{"text":"I lived in the Clarkson are for Years, and never checked out this place until I moved and came back down to visit and thought why not take a date here ! So I did ....date night here at casalinga. Stepping in you notice it's very small . Not much privacy at all , but it's cozy . As well the decor is nice . The food ....ahh the food .....what's the word I should use for the food ? ...how about AMAZING or INCREDIBLE! Honestly the food is just fantastic. Prices are reasonable for a nice place to take a date and you'll fall in love with the taste of the pizza and pasta !  Honestly give them a try  I'll definitely be back !"}
{"text":"A 3 star puréed rappini soup that needed ice cubes to be added to avoid scalding my mouth to begin and then a Margherita Pizza worthy of a 3.5 star rating. My wife had a sausage crostini appetizer that was fine as well (maybe a 3.5) followed by salad, sans dressing, that was very much a disappointment.  In finishing I have add that we arrived early enough to miss the supposed normal rush which I would have thought would have pleased our ashen faced server, but alas no. My heartfelt suggestion to him is if you've already had a bad day before you get to work either get over it, or book off."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the service as the server didn't acknowledge the existence of our 7 person table until 20 min after our arrival. They sat us in the back corner. Could be because we were a table of all ethic people. Also, they had a freak out session full of huffs and puffs because we didn't notify them that it's going to be on different bills. They didn't ask when we first walked in. They probably forgot since it took them 20 min to acknowledge us. Anyways defiantly not coming for a second time."}
{"text":"4 of us enjoyed an amazing meal last night.  The restaurant is a little small, tables are tightly placed and reservations are highly recommended but it's all worth it. The eggplant and calamari apps. we're great. The risotto and  Penne pasta were fantastic. My husband who is a self-proclaimed Caesar salad connesieur said it was the best he has ever had. We will definitely add this place to our list of places to return."}
{"text":"Nice, casual place in a strange location. Delicious thin crust pizzas and pastas with ready access to delicious hot pepper spread."}
{"text":"This is a charming local Italian restaurant located in a strip mall.  The food was delicious and the service was excellent.    We ordered a large Caesar salad to share.  I especially loved the crispy salty pancetta and shaved parmesan on the salad.    My friend ordered the Penne Casalinga (grilled chicken, wild mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes in a white wine butter cream sauce, fresh parmigiano) and finished every last bite and clearly enjoyed it.   I had the Penne al Ragu di Coltello on the server's recommendations.  The sauce is similar to a gravy (brandy demi-glaze) with beef tenderloins, wild mushrooms, caramelized onion and fresh tomatoes topped with grano padano cheese.  I really enjoyed the flavour of this dish but I found the beef tenderloins somewhat tough and chewy (which is the only reason I am giving the restaurant four instead of 5 stars).  If I was in the area, I would most definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is usually one of our go to restaurants, but was a little disappointed with the service. They took our drink and food order at the same time, only to get our food after a party of three came in, got served their appetizer and food order.   A very mumbled, \"sorry\" for the lateness.  The pizza special was soggy, and my pasta was okay.  Will have to think twice the next time we decide to go there."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Had a great lunch/ dinner as the meals were large enough that we took half and it became dinner too. I had the calamari fritti with seafood linguine pasta and my husband had the beef carpaccio with beef pasta dish. A little expensive for lunch $77 no alcohol but like I said it made two meals so . Nice find. You won't be disappointed if you're expecting authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Went to Casalinga for the first time tonight, with my family, to celebrate my birthday.  The service was great.  Very friendly and inviting. The food was delicious. I had the Gnocchi, which was handmade.  Delicious! So glad I decided to try this restaurant this restaurant and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice this year; once for my birthday and once for Father's Day. Clearly it's an approved dining choice by my family!  ATMOSPHERE: Nice, but casual. The restaurant is REALLY small though, so reservations are highly recommended. FYI: They're on OpenTable - if you want to collect points.  If you don't make reservations, you may be forced to wait outdoors - as they do not have a waiting area within the restaurant doors.  SERVICE: Great service! They can get pretty packed - as it was when I was there on Father's Day, but they make great effort to care for you. Our server was personable, making great recommendations throughout the meal. This was true for both meals I experienced - one was at a table of 3, and the other was a table of 6 (with 3 kids, no less!) - and service was good for both party sizes.  PRICE: Good prices for the food, and atmosphere. Reasonable for a night out.  FOOD: Fresh, well-presented and tasty. Everyone enjoyed the shared appetizers (grilled calamari & shrimp with salad), and their own individual dishes (whether it's pizza, pasta or red meat dishes - everything was perfectly prepared).   My mom is a pasta lover - and she was happy to be introduced to such a great place that's close to home. My dad was very impressed by the food and service (especially when our server offered an extra nakpin to protect his white shirt - without being asked) - which is usually difficult to please on both fronts. So this place is entering our list of roster of go-to restaurants for family celebrations!  It's a great gem in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Amazing food, generous portion sizes, great staff! We always feel like family when we eat here! Saffron risotto is my personal favourite if it's available with one of the specials. Wood oven, hand crafted pizzas are a must!"}
{"text":"Good food, good portions.   Service was slow and needs a lot of improvement.   I am accustomed to restaurants where the server would come and introduce themselves when you arrive and perhaps offer you something to drink.   Now half of our party was delayed and I have to admit I was stressed and embarrassed.  I expected our server to offer drinks or appetizers while we wait...that didn't happen sadly.    During dinner not once did anyone come to ask if everything is okay or if we needed anything.  You know usual server routine.   When dinner ended we waited for our server to offer coffee and dessert for some time that we ended having to ask if there is coffee.  Since it was my husbands bday they did bring a slice of cake with candle and sang happy bday.  Not sure that should make up for the mediocre service.    I wouldn't recommend this resto for large groups, good for smaller more intimate dining."}
