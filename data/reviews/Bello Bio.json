{"text":"We went to Bello Bio earlier this month to check out their selection of products. All the food items there are vegan, and imported from Italy. The imported part sounded a little strange, since I've never thought of Italy as a very veg friendly place, but we learned from the owner, that Italy has a growing vegan/vegetarian population  Great selection of random products. They have grain based pseudo-meats, and a very interesting MozzaRisella sprouted rice based soft dairy free cheese, which made an excellent addition to a recent caprese salad. They have prepared foods, and frozen items available to take home (such as varieties of vegan stuffed ravioli.)  Those folks are friendly, and the products have a lot to offer flavourwise. And I liked that they have products that are vegan/plant-based, without depending entirely on soy.  I'm looking forward to going back and picking up more stuff soon!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Toronto off and on for a number of years, I've been to many vegan restaurants in the city. And though I've only been to Bello Bio once, I'm convinced this is the best vegan resto in city.   The food is hands down the best in the city. Bello Bio make simple, understated, but absolutely divine Italian cuisine. I ordered an arancino, an eggplant parmesan panino, and coconut/banana gelato, and it was the best vegan food I've had in a long while. I think this says a lot about the place, since I've been living in NYC for the last 3 months and, honestly, I would choose Bello Bio food over almost everything I've had over that time.   The imported vegan products are a very welcome change from the domestic options, such as Daiya, that almost every other vegan restaurant is using. It makes the dishes taste unique, and the products themselves are delicious. I was a big fan of the vegan rice cheese used in the arancino.  The restaurant itself is clean and simply decorated. But what makes the atmosphere isn't the decor, but the people. The owner and chef spoke with my table extensively, and they are genuinely excited to meet new people and to show off their food. Everyone I interacted with was gracious and welcoming, and it really made me feel special and appreciated.  The prices are really reasonable (a *huge* arancino is $3.75 and a panino is $9.95), and you will definitely not leave hungry.   I really wish I could go here more often, and if I lived in the city, I'd be buying takeout, and eating in at least once a week. I'm so happy that Bello Bio has opened up in TO, and I can't wait to eat here again.  Thanks to the Bello Bio staff for being so awesome. Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"Bello Bio is absolutely amazing. I tried the rice balls, eggplant parm, tiramisu, and seitan. I also bought lots of pasta to take home. My favourite part was the cheese they use in the rice balls and eggplant parm - it truly tasted like real mozzarella. I was really happy to see that they sold vegan chocolate hazelnut spread that actually has a Nutella-like consistency, and is not just blended up hazelnuts with cocoa powder.  I will definitely be going back for more very, very soon!"}
{"text":"To the best of my knowledge the only authentic vegan organic Italian restaurant in Toronto. You may dine in or take out and shop for amazing vegan products imported from Italy. A must try is their seitan cutlet and their eggplant parmesan on a panini or rosemary foccaccia along with the Caprese Salad. To end your amazing lunch or dinner I recommend their tiramisu & cannoli. Their entire menu is fantastic!! Thanks guys. :)  Per quanto a mia conoscenza, l'unico autentico ristorante italiano biologico vegan a Toronto. Si può cenare o da asporto e negozio di prodotti vegan stupefacenti importati da Italia. Dovete assolutamente provare è la cotoletta di seitan e il loro parmigiano melanzane su un panino o focaccia al rosmarino con l'insalata caprese. Per terminare la cena stupefacente vi consiglio il loro tiramisù e cannoli. Il loro intero menù è fantastico! Grazie ragazzi. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've gone a couple of times with my husband and our family and friends. I can't say enough good stuff. This place is so welcoming and warm (the owners are so nice!), the food is wholesome and yummy, and it's just such a fun place to eat.  I absolutely love the pastas (the kamut penne is great!), the meatballs, the seitan, the grilled panini, the tiramisu... and everything else that I've tried. Nothing has been a miss. It's all super delicious.  This place is fantastic for groups of all sizes. If you go with a group, ask about doing a family-style shared meal. They'll provide you with a huge spread of incredible stuff to split with each other.  They also have a really nice selection of imported goods near the front. Pastas, spreads, sauces, sweet treats, and a whole bunch more. Today, I picked up some kamut shells, some artichoke spread, and a seitan roast. Yum!  Bello Bio is my favorite new place in the city."}
{"text":"Drawn to visit this place by the great reviews, my guest and I were very disappointed. That said, the 3 owners/workers that were present when we visited were extremely pleasant, accommodating, and sweet, and I didn't have the heart to be honest about the food despite that I should have been.   I will preface this review by saying my guest and I are both originally from NYC, and I still live there part time, while my guest does full time. We have eaten at the best Italian restaurants in the city, as well as some of the best vegan, so we KNOW good food. Whether this was an \"off\" night or what, our perceptions of the place do not match the other reviews.  The food:  My guest had a seitan dish which was very good. The seitan itself was delicious, though the potatoes it was served with were just good. Further, the marinara sauce used was just basic.  The gnocchi was weirdly textured and flavored. I've had much better vegan gnocchi before, though the meat sauce was pretty delicious, albeit basic.  The rice ball, while huge, as other reviewers mentioned, was poorly done. Way too much rice to fried ratio. It basically tasted like overcooked white rice with tomato sauce. I've had MUCH better.  The cannoli was literally inedible. This was our first try at a vegan cannoli, so we didn't necessary expect it to be as great as the traditional Italian ones we'd had, but we definitely expected it to not be so disgusting we had to struggle to eat a few bites so as not to offend the people who truly seem to care about the food they serve.  The tour of Italy dessert, which was a lemon tart, was very good, though super tart.   The cappuccino was delicious.  We also bought from the market, the smoked and regular imported mozzarella, which, while interesting, were not great. We've eaten some in a make shift caprese salad, which made it much better, and on crackers it's ok. The combo pack of five different types of chocolate seems to be very good, though we've only tried the orange one so far.  Basically, this place would have gotten a basic 3 stars if it were not for the inedible cannoli that tasted like cleaner. This was unforgiveable, and literally the worst dessert my guest and I had ever tried...and we are HUGE foodies who eat out a lot and try many different types of food."}
{"text":"Delicious organic vegetarian food with a unique Italian flavor. Very friendly staff. There's also a vegan / vegetarian ingredient food section as well where you can find Italian organic products like rice mozzarella!  Great find! Also free parking on a side street off mt pleasant. Here's a pic of their dairy free tiramisu"}
{"text":"The best vegan restaurant in Toronto, hands down.   The food is outstanding -- elegant, simple and authentic.   The owners felt like family after one meal service. Try saying that about any other vegan restaurant in town. There's no other place like Bello Bio, period.   It's fucking magical."}
