{"text":"Had the traditional Gyro with salad. It was exceptional. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant when I'm in town."}
{"text":"We just love this place and we're so glad they've stayed in business.  It's family run, and everyone that works there is so nice.  The food is great and there's really nothing quite like it in Henderson.  We drive out from Boulder City to eat there sometimes."}
{"text":"This was our first official meal as Nevada residents & we will be coming back!  Everything was delicious & fresh.  We had the falafel appetizer, chicken souvlaki & filet mignon souvlaki (both with lemon potatoes). Just AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Tried this on our way to Costco...My gyro salad was tasty but for the pool of grease on the plate...hubby enjoyed his gyro...neither of us cared for the tzaziki....we much prefer Yanni's!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice while visiting Vegas. The food was excellent as was the service.  I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Greek I've had in the US. Definitely the best I've had for the price. We had the traditional Gyro and Baba Ganoush. Staff was very friendly and it was kid friendly. We had our 8 month old with us and several others had kids too."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's consistently good. I feel good every time after my lunch. I always get the chicken gyro but my wife will get other things off the menu and never had had a complaint. So leave the comfort of Sunset Station and wonder over for some fresh Greek."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good Greek restaurant for some time. My expectations are high as I am Greek American and both parents were excellent cooks. I tried dolmades and mousaka...delicious! Gotta have that hint of cinnamon which is a trademark of Greek cooking. Also the shrimp with spinach rice is excellent too. Highly recommend this little bistro and am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Greek place in town. Good prices and the family that runs it always remembers us. 

Things to try:
Chicken gyro
Chicken salad (has feta, cucumbers, tomatoes and yummy Greek dressing)
Pita and hummus 
Baklava"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for 10 years!! I live quit close and just fell in love with the friendly people and of course the fresh and delicious food. I've had so many things on their menu. Lol. It's so hard to pick what I want. I have since moved from Henderson and now live by Nellis Air base and I still drive there to get my fix! I love the food!! I think everyone who loves Mediterranean food should come here!! They are the best by far!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here forever and it is always great!  They make the best lamb shank, Pastitsio - Greek Lasagna, and gyro... plus the Greek seasoned fries and super with the white dipping sauce!  Never had a bad meal here and the service is very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Having eaten greek food for years from average restaurants to fine dining, the food you get here for the price is really good and well worth it. Very chill place to kick back and eat some nice greek food."}
{"text":"I've been to Greek Bistro twice now. The first time? Don't quite remember it which usually means the food didn't stand out too much. 

I stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant today, all by mistake. I called to order take out, but accidentally called the wrong place. Oops! 

When I arrived, (a bit past the 15-20 minutes) the food was still hot. I enjoyed seeing the Greek restaurant was actually ran by GREEK people!

My mother had ordered a Chicken Gyro and I had ordered a Chicken Souvlaki plate. Both came with salad and the souvlaki plate came with the choice of rice or potatoes, all for $24. Reasonable price. I opted for the delicious rice.

As soon as I tasted the rice, with some Tzatziki I added, my taste buds had an explosion. It was delicious! The pita bread tasted homemade and  was extremely soft and delicious. The chicken was good, but I have had better. It was really tender, hot, and satisfying. Yet, it seemed like there wasn't enough flavor or maybe too strong of a certain flavor. All together, the chicken, rice, and pita in the Chicken Souvlaki plate were enjoyed! They were actually devoured! The salad was just as amazing with not too much dressing, nor too little dressing. So yummy! My mother said she loved the gyro. I took a bite and agreed to disagree. The  chicken wasn't what I would've expected. I don't know if it had too many condiments or such, but it could have been better. Much better. The chicken in the souvlaki plate tasted somewhat better. 

I might be back, I might not. Depends on whether I call the right place next time!"}
{"text":"Great food every time! They will even make us a vegetarian gyro, which is not on the menu. A friendly, family-owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I am addicted to the gyro salad.  DELICIOUS.  The prices are a little hefty for what is just a hole in the wall pseudo fast food joint.  But the flavors keep me coming back almost weekly.  The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Henderson and Las Vegas. Pita are freshly baked. The star is the Baklava. Generous serving and heavenly. Service is always great. Everything they serve comes in generous portions."}
{"text":"Tom C 
Greek food is a favorite of mine. Upon finding this Greek restaurant close to my hotel I noticed a dish that I was not familiar with, Shrimp ala Greek. It contained shrimp in a cream sauce over a bed of spinach almond rice. Included was a well prepared Greek salad and fresh pita bread. The restaurant was staffed by a gracious Greek family. A most enojoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Incredible! Best Greek salad in town! I have been looking for something quality & quick so this place will be my new favorite stop between meetings!"}
{"text":"Fabulous greek food, I always eat here when in town.  Having sampled nearly the entire menu now, I can say that it is all good.  They hand make most everything and you can tell that they put a lot of love into what they do.  Not only that but the owners work there and they remember us even when its been a year.  If you want good greek food, great service, and want to get it from people who really care about it then I suggest you run over to the Greek Bistro.  No, run faster, you'll thank me for being hungry when you get there."}
{"text":"A cute, family owned Greek restaurant in a small nondescript strip mall near the Sunset Casino in Henderson. Love the moussaka and gyros. Their Tzatziki is to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Greek food while in Henderson and stumbled across this mom & pop restaurant near Sunset Station. A small & cozy place that has a mural of a city to make you almost feel like you're in Greece plus the some of that great Greek music that makes you dance in your chair...OPA! Oh they did happen to play the Mamma Mia soundtrack while we were there so I felt like I was reenacting the movie but it was still an enjoyable atmosphere. 

The owners were great and friendly, providing quick service and checking to make sure that you were satisfied with your meal. Overall we were pleasantly surprised by this place & highly recommend it to those craving Greek and near Galleria mall! 

We started with the baba ganoush appetizer and this little sucker packed some flavor. This was the best baba ganoush I have had in a while, not to mention the crispy & soft pita that came with this dish. 

For entrees, we ordered a chicken gyro with fries and a beef kabob with rice. Lots of food for the price, yes I thought it was pricey for being a small restaurant but the food quality did make up for the price. The beef was so tender, it melted in your mouth. Salad had a great homemade olive oil dressing. We were happy campers with our meals and stuffed. I was a little sad that I couldn't sample dessert because this truly wouldn't be a great review without dessert. I did, however, settle for a Mythos, which taste like a Heineken. 

This place is definitely worth checking out, if not dining than definitely take out as most people were doing."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago which happens to be the center of Greek food in the U.S. 

There are many small fast food places around Chicago where you can get good Gyros sandwiches. I had them once or twice a week- so long story short- I know gyros.

Having a craving for gyros in Vegas is hard. You just can't find it GOOD out here. So after reading the reviews I decided to give Greek Bistro a try.

I ordered the gyros sandwich and Greek fries combo. At $8.99 without a drink it is quite pricey, but I also realize that all the gyros is shipped in from Chicago- nobody makes it in the west, so cost will obviously be more.

The sandwich was not exactly what you would get back east. First was the sauce. Now you are supposed to get \"Tzadziki\" sauce which is a thick yogurt based cucumber sauce that is very light and tasty. I don't know what my gyros was drowning in, but my best guess is some sort of modified ranch dressing. It was a thin runny sour flavored ranch dressing. I took the sandwich out of the tray and the stuff ran out all over.

The gyros meat itself was OK but not nearly as much on the sandwich as you would hope for $9. Also on the sandwich was a few leaves of romaine lettuce ad literally 3-4 strands of onion. Chicago style is loaded with onions.

Also, the gyros slices were very uniform. This tells me they don't carve it from their own spit and probably buy it pre sliced. The texture and taste of gyros right off the spit is far superior.

My only other gripe was I originally wanted to eat in, but after seeing the flimsy looking blue plastic chairs in the dining area (I'm a big guy) I decided to be safe and just take the stuff home.

OK, I have to give them at least one good note. I really liked the \"Greek fries\" Good tasting fries tossed in a spice mixture.

Sorry, but I probably won't be going there again."}
{"text":"The owner is so sweet she makes you feel like you're in her home! Best gyro in Vegas so far!! Everything I've tried has been delicious!"}
{"text":"DAMNED kick ass food,,,,this is how a GYRO SHOULD TASTE,,yes, I came from chicago and have ate in chicago for the past 33 years and have had my share of gyro meat,,whether it be straight cooked off the spit or fried after the spit but this greek bistro is truly great,,,although a little pricy and the quantity of food isnt compared to the quantity of chicago(fully loaded) it is really great..i would definitely recommend this place to friends and anyone.:)"}
{"text":"the Kabob was so awsome and tasty...very clean and nice place..the employees also very friendly and professional...i love greek food,this one of the best i ever have...."}
{"text":"Found this gem a few years ago and every year we visit we come back here to eat! The gyro meat is from the spot, the tzatziki is spot on and the keftedakia is perfectly done. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Greek Bistro for lunch (several times) and have had their salads (good), spanakopita (okay), and gyros (good). The service is good and friendly. 

The place is small, in a strip mall, and is not the typical restaurant atmosphere that you would expect when you are having someone wait on you for dinner. With that said, the prices are a little high for lunch and to have to tip on top of that...not for just a good salad. They should go back to more of the casual service environment they used to be where you order at the counter, get your number, and they deliver to your table. 

I like them, but I've had better Greek food in Vegas for their prices."}
{"text":"Best greek food ever! Best costumer service i have had ! The owners nooshin and bijan are amazing! U must come try"}
{"text":"I have been trying to find authentic Greek food in Vegas area. I have been misled by all the \"Greek\" renounced places that sell only initiations. This is by far the MOST AUTHENTIC Greek food I have seen in the entire valley.  Simply delicious."}
{"text":"Started the day off by doing some charity work for kids!! Those of you that do that sort of thing know how much of an appetite it can work up! So we wanted to follow up with some good quality food. That's exactly what this restaurant offers! The Gyro and Fries were especially satisfying. Filled with meat and flavorful toppings, this was obviously the way to go. The fries that go along with it could be a dish that you could have by itself. It had unique herbs and spices to send your taste buds rolling. The pita bread at this place is just unreal, so soft and warm, it just compliments the food so well. 

The service was amazing. They treated all of their customers like family. It's definitely one of those places where they remember their frequent customers. 

My experience here was absolutely exquusite, can't wait to come back ^^ !!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here much too infrequently for a quick lunch. Today we both had the chicken souvlaki with lemon potatoes. As is typically the case, the food was outstanding. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Not sure what they do to the vegetables that are on the skewer but they're always so sweet. This is also the only restaurant that I actually eat all the potatoes.
The waitstaff are always attentive. The owner is always around and she make sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing and hands-down the best greek restaurant around."}
{"text":"By far the best Greek Restaurant in Las Vegas/Henderson! I live about half an hour away and will gladly drive out for the Gyro's! Traditional or Chicken, you can't go wrong! Always fresh and flavorful, and let me just say their fries (Greek style) are to do for! The seasoning they use is what makes them so good! Family owned and operated and always friendly, they make you feel right at home! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is the most awesome place on the planet. I love the food. I love the owner and her family. I'm here weekly. Can't get enough of her cooking."}
{"text":"The best tazatiki sauce in town. I love the small, family atmosphere and they almost always have a game on! The traditional gyro is amazing and flavorful and delightfully sinful at the same time. The Greek fries are full of garlic-y goodness and guaranteed to repel any stalkers waiting for you in the parking lot. A friend had the Greek lasagna lol it tasted a lot better than it looked.

No need to say I'll be back...I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"We've been customers for over a decade and the food (Gyro's and hummus) is fantastic! The customer service has remained exceptional throughout that time as well. The family owners work very hard and remain sincere."}
{"text":"What a find !   Leaving Costco (in Henderson) about a week ago, I pulled up Yelp hoping to dine someplace different.   After seeing so many positive reviews and not having any Greek food in quite some time, I gave it a shot.  Fortunately, Yelp guided me is as the restaurant is a little off the Marks Road (and just south Sunset), and the signage is not visible from Marks Road.  The decor is modest but, more importantly,  the staff was very friendly, the menu / selection was decent, and the food / prices were awesome.  During the course of my meals, there was a steady flow of carry out business which is always a good sign.  I plan to visit again - soon!"}
{"text":"I admit- I was nervous to try hummus for the first time. As well as Greek food. I was blown away by the delicious hummus and Greek lasagna. My mom was so delighted by the food (also a first timer) got an order to go for dinner the next day. The owners were honestly friendly and explained each entree in detail. Please experience this authentic Greek Bistro. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"i didnt feel like driving to stephanos since greek bistro is just around the corner to where i live...and i regret it! i think the owner should dine at other greek restaurants to see what they're missing...the GREEK taste!  like i said i regret not driving to stephanos."}
{"text":"I have passed this place many times and decided a few days ago to stop in. I placed an order to go and it didn't take long. The lady at the counter was very nice. When I told her it was my first time in she suggested their most popular items.  I chose the chicken gyro. It was delicious. I wish I had stopped in sooner. The sauce was tasty. I even locked the left over sauce from the wrapper. Yeah it was that good. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 chicken gyros with a salad and fries. Everything tastes great and the veggies were super fresh."}
{"text":"Gyro only had two pieces of meat.. chicken plate only had about six pieces of meat for $13? Garlic sauce tasted like sour cream, we will not be back. Rip off for sure don't even bother trying go to the 'The Great Greek' instead"}
{"text":"The only greek food place I go to! The best gyros and hummus I've ever had. Highly recommend this place. Family run and operated. Doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Mediterranean food I ever tasted. The chicken salad is so good and packed with flavor. I recommend this restaurant to people."}
{"text":"Had the gyro salad....it was huge!!  Can't wait to go back and get another one!!!  My friend had the chicken kabob....she said \"I want to have my birthday dinner here!!\"  And this girl is not easy to please!!

Nice to be able to support a local small business AND get awesome greek food!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurant In the neighborhood and in Vegas.
Very nice staff and good costumer service 
Fresh and delicious food
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Just went to get TAKE OUT & food is still hot and tasted so good every time !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down THE best Greek food in Vegas! I keep coming back! The gyros sandwiches are the best I've had. Pita is super soft, meat is tender and flavorful, nothing dried out (my pet peeve). The gyros salad is huge! Tons of meat in it. Order with dressing and sauce on the side, it's better that way. The baklava? Fantastic. Everything we order always is super fresh! And the service is great. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very nice, friendly service and great food 
The price is reasonable and the tzatziki was pretty good. It was my first time here in a couple of years but it was worth the return"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! It was so delicious and so filling. I got the traditional gyro with a salad. Perfection! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The gyro is phenomenal, service is great. Good luck finding a better gyro in this town!!!! Oh and the fries are unreal!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great family run feel. Hidden gem. Traditional gyro was great! Yummy hummus! Excellent rice pudding... Baklava was good.. Not great! Overall excellent experience though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came into town tonight for Tough Mudder. We live in a small town with limited options for restaurants. Driving to our hotel, eye spyed Greek Bistro. We stopped in for dinner. Walking into the restaurant, we were greated with a smiling young man and his beautiful mother. The customer service was outstanding. The Dolmades, the falafel sandwich, and the Mythology beer was so delicious. My husband had the shrimp on top of delicious rice. The pita was fresh and delicious. The young man checked on us a few times during our meal. We still have half of our food leftover in the mini fridge. We ordered baklava to go(no room for anything else!) if we ever come back to Henderson, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought I'd switch it up from my usual Greek place down the way and try the Greek Bistro out since Yelpers seem to love this place. Yeah, the reviews did not mislead!! I tried the Gyro salad  and I loved it! It comes with a house made, olive oil-based dressing that really makes the salad! I'm not a fan of olives so I got the salad without. The lettuce (romaine) was fresh and crisp. The gyro meat (and there was plenty of it!) was tender and flavorful. Salad also came with feta cheese, red onion, tomato, cucumber and a wonderful tzakai sauce. Salad and soda came out to $13.00. I will return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there and everything was tasty.  This is my go to greek spot in town.  Gyros, of course are good. But their fries are super good."}
{"text":"We looked for a restaurant that was within walking distance of our hotel.  We were very pleased to have found The Greek Bistro. The gyros plate was excellent and the service was prompt and personable.  Many people seemed to be regulars and there was a high volume of take-out, as well.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Greek dining option in Las Vegas.  The food is amazing!  I went with a group of friends Friday night and went back the next day for more.  Everything I tried was delicious."}
{"text":"On vacation for the week in Vegas. Wanted something besides strip food.....!!!the hubby likes Greek so I found this place here! Great food, I had the gyro plate, he had the gyro, also had the lemon chicken rice soup, yum! Meat was moist and flavorful. Everything looked good! We got the baklava to go. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Is it possible that the food gets better and better each time we go.
Visit here at least once a week...about a 20 min drive.WELL WORTH IT!!!!!
Their food is fresh,rice pudding to die for...friendly family who owns it!
A must try!"}
{"text":"We tried the lamb shank and the moussaka, omg to die for!! the lamb shank literally breaks apart with a plastic fork, so tender and the moussaka is so flavorful and rich!! yum!! we will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Potentially the best Greek food I've ever had, with also the nicest staff! Family owned and very good service, and the food was worth every penny. 

We both ordered the TRADITIONAL GYRO, which was so delicious, had lots of meat that was juicy as well as flavorful! The fries were also really good! 

The baklava was a great way to end the meal too. Wish they would open a location on the north side... worth the drive for Greek food fix though! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden little gem in Henderson.  When I lived on this side of town we would go here exclusively for the Gyro's.  The sauce they put on it is amazing.  Also, the fries with the garlic sauce is a favorite of my boyfriends.  This is a mom and pop kind of place and you are served by their family.  As for the other food on the menu....I've never tried any of it.  Whenever we go to another greek place we always talk about the greek bistro and how we wish we lived closer to it."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service!! 
Dine in & takeout, they also serve beer and wine...it's becoming a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Went here since our fave greek place is closed. The food was ok incomparable to my fave place. I ordered the rice with shrimp and almonds with white  sauce. It was something new. I didn't like the iced coffee, since it says greek cofee im thinking its something special but seems like a regular coffee. I didn't like its ambience. 

Im not sure if i will come back, maybe"}
{"text":"I eat here with and without the wife at least once a week. The restaurant is owned and operated by a greek family who is always friendly. The food is fantastic and as authentic as can be! The portions are large and filling. I have never had a bad meal and take my out of town guests here all the time. Every time any of them visits me they always ask to come back here!"}
{"text":"Made our way around town and ended up here at the Greek Bistro.  What a great decision that was!!  Service was very good and the young woman helping us answered all our questions about the menu items.  This is now on my dining hotspot radar.  Had the original Gyro.  Salad & Fries on the side.  Good-good.  
Highlight was the Rice pudding for sure!  Zeus would be proud!  As for me, just want to give an honest review to all of you and stay away from Hades..  LOL"}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO good!!! When We walked in around 5pm, the restaurant was empty except for one person waiting for their call in order. I was a little hesitant at first...

I ordered the gyro plate. The pita bread tasted amazing, the meat was so flavorful, the tzatziki was delicious and the lemon potatoes were perfect.

My boyfriend ordered a shrimp and rice plate that was amazing!

The side salad that comes with the meal is really yummy too, lots of feta and great house dressing.

The two owners were there tonight too, such a sweet couple. The lady was our server, her hospitality and friendliness was outstanding.

This is a great restaurant that I will recommend to everyone. Go here! The food is so delicious.

By the time we left around 6pm the restaurant had really started to fill up. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek I've had. Our family visits here often. My wife is vegetarian and loves the spanakopita. It is really big and she loves it! I get the gyro with fries. Both are so flavorful. The fries have homemade spices on top. This appears to be own by a family. The mom is always in the kitchen cooking and the children help with seating and orders. We've done sit down and take out. Both are great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely am never disappointed at any meal here.  One of my favorites, family owned and run with great food and though small , very friendly atmosphere.  Lamb shank is superb as is pistachio.  Desserts fantastic. 
Just tried new one I highly recommend, numoorah! Try it!"}
{"text":"Went here one random hungry afternoon for lunch. I have always driven by this place but never actually stopped to eat. Now that I know I have no idea why it has taken me so long!! The food is so good!!!!!! Love the mom and pop feel to it. and I love the mom and pops who owns it! they were so sweet and friendly.
 I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a great little place. Fantastic food and awesome service. Winning combo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! I'm in town for less than 36 hours and I've eaten here twice. I love Greek food but rarely find it this good. The dolomides are excellent. Both times I just got the gyro plate. A lot of food and exceptional. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is really great. It isn't really fancy, but who needs fancy. It is nice, clean, and casual. Everything is fresh and made onsite and they even have Greek beer.  We will be back....soon"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas looking for a place to eat and just happened to stop in at the Greek Bistro. I got the traditional gyro and babganush. I never had babaganish so I gave it a try. It was good! The gyro was probably the best gyro I ever had. They didn't skimp on the meat either. It was packed. The food tasted fresh.  
The service was excellent. I would highly recommend this place. The price is reasonable for how much food you get."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place! My grandparents live in Vegas and I'm in town visiting from Chicago. Any other foodies know that Chicago is one of the best chow-towns in the country. However, the food at Greek Bistro rivals the best restaurants in Greektown back home.

Not only is the food EXTRAORDINARY, the decor is so cute and festive. The place is outstandingly clean, comfy and welcoming. 

The restaurant is owned by an Albanian family that makes the dining experience as wonderful as their dishes. This is what \"ma & pa\" shops are all about: authentic food, great service and reasonable prices.

Run, don't walk, to this gem!"}
{"text":"Great little Greek spot!! We ordered the babaganoush, pastichio, gyro plate and the galaktobouriko for dessert! All of it was very good and the staff was very friendly!! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good gyro, excellent hummus. Enjoy that small family restaurant. Huge portions , one of the better baklava 
Will go back and share an entree"}
{"text":"Yum!  They don't have a kids menu, but they have a great kids plate with gyro meat or chicken, rice and fries.  Saffron chicken special was amazing! The spanikopita was just delicious.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. It's in the same shopping center as my work but I had yet to discover it. I ordered the Gyro with salad and a side of hummus via phone which was ready in 5 min. I love this type of food and have had a lot of Gyros around town. The traditional Gyro I had today was excellent. It was so big I couldn't eat the salad that was with it. The hummus was good and I had to share it because it too was a large portion. It came with pita chips and bread which was a treat. Overall, the food was wonderful and I'll make it a point to come back. Thanks for a great lunch! =)"}
{"text":"Great food. The lemon potatoes were amazing.  The chicken kabob was tender and tasty. Definitely a must try for Greek food."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in the Las Vegas area. Hard to find, but worth the search. Sits just behind the Wildfire casino in the the Sunset Station parking lot. Let's keep these mom and pop gems in business."}
{"text":"We had dinner which was delightful. There are about 8 tables in the restaurant. We were meet by I believe was one of the owners. She told us to sit where we wanted to. She was very nice and helpful with the items on the menu. There were four of us. For appetizers we had Hummus and Babaganoush. Which came with warm Pita bread and Pita chips. For our main course we had lamb Souvlaki, Spanakopita, Mousakka and, Shrimp ala Greek. Each came with a Greek salad. The appetizers were delicious. I had never tried Babaganoush before but my sister in law suggested it. The wine she suggested paired well with our meal. Everyone was very happy with their meals. We got some Baklava for later. The meal was very reasonably priced and the service was very good. We have had Baklava before and this was different it had a slight lemony flavor to it which I really liked."}
{"text":"Each time we visit Henderson, we have lunch at Greek Bistro.  Always very good and authentic as well."}
{"text":"It's just. not. fair! Why does Henderson, on the other side of Vegas from me, have all the best Greek places? There's Great Greek, and Stephano's, and Yalla, and now I discover you even have Greek Bistro (hard though it was to find). Not fair!

Food here is perfect. They have three salads, several wraps and plates, and a variety of desserts and apps. Despite the casual setting, there is table-service. Love the wall-sized photo of Greece and the blue-and-white decor scheme.

The gyros salad is my favorite purchase, topped with tomatoes, feta, and a ton (perhaps a bit too much, best asked for on the side) of delicious tzatziki sauce, as well as a generous amount of gyros meat. Their gyro wraps are also delightful, with fresh and pillowy pita and a giant portion size. Their fries are spectacular, whether or not you order them Greek style and add feta. 

Pricing is fair for the portions (about $10/person) and quality, service is friendly, and basically everything on their menu is to die for."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the staff/owner are jerks. Not only do they give you a sour face when you use a groupon. We didn't even eat there.  We got our food to go, even left a tip AND they were super reluctant to give me an extra garlic/yogurt sauce. That stuff costs 5 cents at most! Absolutely ridiculous. If you didn't want to honor the groupon deal then why sign up for it? Absolute horse crap. Never again."}
{"text":"BEST GYROS IN LAS VEGAS!!!! 

This place is phenomenal! Traditional Gyro is the best I have ever had, hands down. Their lamb is succulent and amazing. They also serve Greek seasoned fries with your Gyro. The restaurant has a very authentic feel and you can see that it is family owned. The server was very nice and explained everything on the menu. 

This family takes pride in their food and it's evident in the taste. I will never eat a Gyro at another restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love this little place. Owners are awesome and the food is the best Greek in my area.   If you are around the Galleria Mall/Sunset station, definitely try them!!!   the Pasticio is soooooooo creamy delicious."}
{"text":"Ran in for a quick take out order., so didn't sample too much.  The dining area was very busy for 5:00 at a retail-casual location so I had high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed.  

Very traditional Greek menu.  The pastichio was outstanding and was enough for me for 2 meals.  The gryo salad was also spectacular and upon request they kept the meat separate so my salad didn't warm on the ride home.  Good prices, great service and outstanding Greek fare. 

Now they need a fancy location with a bar so I can bring my wife on our anniversary."}
{"text":"I'll be honest I am not always in the mood for Greek food perhaps it's the lack of good Greek food.  But cravings are back with this place. 

My most favorite soup is served here, their \"Avgolemono\". I could eat this soup any day and every day!  But there have been times where they run out...and I can't tell you how disappointing this can be. We also order the Gyro with Greek Fries, spanakopita and the Moussaka also very delicious.  They also have combos and a must try is also their rice pudding! 

Service is not always the greatest but as long as they keep that Avgolemono soup cooking I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say WOW! This place is so good you must try it. I had the chicken gyro and my wife had the traditional gyro and both were out of this world. I'm coming back ALOT!"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant I've had in the Vegas Valley! I much prefer Greek Bistro over The Great Greek about a mile away. Greek Bistro has great prices, a broader and more authentic Greek menu and the deserts are on point. My favorite thing to get is their original gyro, their chicken gyro is incredible as well. Definitely try this place out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place gets so many stars, food is cold and service is extremely bad"}
{"text":"Two years later and still amazing!! I really wish I could get into this place more often. I am praying they open a location on the NW side of town."}
{"text":"Meat too salty, rice over cooked and over priced--will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Is it acceptable for employees to be on their phone while waiting on you? Not in my book.  

We walked in one afternoon to an empty dining area.  The guy was on the phone and didn't hang up before walking over to our table.  This also happened when I went up to pay our bill.  I just don't understand taking a personal call while a customer is standing in front of you.  Very unprofessional.  

I will say I liked the gyro with fries.  It was packed with a lot of meat and toppings.  We really could have split it easily.  Unfortunately that is where my enjoyment ended.  My husband and I both did not feel well shortly after our meal.  I can't necessarily point fingers and blame the restaurant.  I certainly can say I wont rush back to test it again."}
{"text":"I ate here last week and loved.  LOVE supporting locally owned businesses and these guys really seem to care about quality and service.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It isn't often that I take the time to write a review particularly for a food establishment but I almost feel compelled to do so regarding Greek Bistro. A sign advertising the gyro special caught my eye and I figured I give it a whirl for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised. I was greeted warmly by the staff and the food not only met but exceeded my expectations. The fries were rightly seasoned and the quality of the meat was superb. The restaurant will definitely be seeing more of me."}
{"text":"While my husband and I don't eat Greek food often, we were pleasantly pleased! Conveniently located in the same parking lot of our hotel, the Palace station, we were able to walk there and were seated right away. I ordered the lamb gyro which was soooo good-the lamb was moist, soft, flavorful and generously portioned; the tsaziki sauce was yummy; the pita was warm and soft; and the Greek salad was tasty! Not to mention, our server, raphi, was such a kind, personable and lively young man. We were able to have a great conversation about his academic endeavors, travel and food."}
{"text":"Definitely will be going here if I'm craving Greek food. Most Greek restaurants by me have food that is either salty or not very fresh. So either the meat wasn't really good so they over season, and they order too much vegetables. Luckily this wasn't the case at Greek Bistro.

  I ordered a Gyro plate and my husband ordered a Gyro sandwich. So tasty! Impressed with the salad, and the rice was cooked to perfection. We both left waddling out of there. 

  Finding this place is a little hard and when you do, you end up driving around a bit to find parking. Don't worry it's worth finding. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu in the future."}
{"text":"Food looks great, don't expect a sit down dinner on a Friday night, it's packed. We will try take out next time. I went for first time but didn't realize how small the place is. Me and my family left for a sit down place with plenty of space. This place should relocate to a much bigger place since it's so popular.  Anyways maybe one day I will visit for take out or a lunch."}
{"text":"FAVORITE GREEK RESTAURANT. Love love love this place. I'm very critical when it comes to my Greek food, but these guys know exactly what they're doing. Always come here when I'm in Nevada, and they never disappoint. Their salads, gyros, fries, everything is so tasty and delicious. If you're in the area definitely give this place a try, you won't be disappointed (: and I also love how fast they are as well!"}
{"text":"The moment you enter you are transformed to the Greek isles. Massive photos adorn the walls so you feel the lush of the ever so blue water and instantly recognize able architecture. Food is authentic and tasty and we did the usual. Hummus app, you get pita bread and chips, score. I had a gyro and my girl a Greek salad add chicken, I know, we always do that so creatures of habit we are. We are not regulars yet but it will happen, soon ."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing!! I'm a total sucker for the lemon potatoes. I've had the chicken kabob and the gyros. In truth, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The atmosphere is mellow and I love that it is family owned."}
{"text":"A double-whammy of excellence - great food and service.

Have been here multiple times and have always received a wonderful experience. Love the fact that their gyro meat is moist and tasty which contrasts the dried out bland meat at other Greek wanna-be establishments.

Being family operated certainly makes the difference.

Even the most basic Greek dish (gyro) is served with all the attention it deserves to keep diners happy. The baklava is a heavenly desert - rich and yummy.

Oh, every time someone enters the Greek Bistro they are welcomed with a sincere greeting.

Even if you are not necessarily a Greek food fan you gotta at least try this bistro simply for the quality of the food. Their strip mall store front-like location makes this place a hidden gem as it's off the main road - almost hidden right off of Sunset Station's open air parking lot (East side) and behind Wildfire casino.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  BF loves gyros, and these were THE BEST.  Normally, I'm not a fan, as they tend to be too salty and/or dry for my taste, but the gyros here were juicy and perfectly seasoned.  I had the falafel, which were nicely-fried globes of goodness (would have preferred tzatziki sauce to the tahini that was included, but that's just my preference.)  The rice pudding was FABULOUS - I would like to have vats of it shipped to my home in San Diego, thank you very much.  Very small dining room, packed on a Sat. at lunch time.  Nice counter guy comped me an iced tea because I had to stand to wait for my to-go order."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today for lunch and had an amazing experience. I ordered a traditional gyro with fries and was not disappointed. I've tried gyros at other Greek restaurants and nothing comes close to the one I had here. The gyro was thoroughly stuffed with all the goodies that brought it to perfection. To top it all off the fries were seasoned with Cajun and other spices that added a little kick to the dish. I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food! They give you a lot of food plus fries! A coworker of mine recommended this place and it wasn't disappointing! Excellent Greek food!"}
{"text":"I'm on a roll with Greek Restaurants lately! 

Great service: Staff Is super nice and attentive. 

Restaurant: Clean and comfortable.  Patrons can watch the staff prepare their food.

Food: The side salad was great. It had lettuce, onions, cucumbers, olives, feta cheese, and the right amount of dressing (It wasn't drowned).

I would come back just to get the lemon potatos. Red potatos perfectly seasoned with a hint of lemon. Very good! 

Great restaurant and I highly recommend stopping by for a meal!"}
{"text":"Years ago I used to go to this place all the time, but when I moved a bit away I just didn't come as often as before.  

But on Saturday I was at the mall so I made a point to come in and try it and see if it was as good as I remembered.  It was!  I ordered the gyro and fries, easy seasoning on the fries.  I got my food in a timely manner and the server was very attentive, making sure my glass was never empty.

When I got my food I took my first bite and kicked myself for staying away so long.  The pita was warm and soft, the meat seasoned perfectly and warmed up just right, the edges had just a bit of crisp and the sauce - as always Yum!  And there was so much food I had to take half of my sandwich and fries home.

I will NOT be waiting years to go back to this amazing place!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness and authentic! Service was fantastic. We had baba ganoush, dolmas, and chicken plate .! Best greek place in town, don't let the location fool you!"}
{"text":"Their French fries are amazing. You can never go wrong ordering their gyros. So delicious and quick. Great service all around."}
{"text":"I was not really a fan of Greek food, especially tzatziki, before I found this gem, so I ordered the chicken gyro and asked for tzatziki on the side.  By itself the gyro stood out as being the best I have ever had and the tzatziki put it over the top.  The fries where really flavorful as well.    I also tried their lemon soup and that had a great taste to it and i will definitely order it again.  Oh and the baklava is amazing as well!  My parents ordered the gyro salad which we both agree was sensational.  We are originally from Chicago which has a huge Greek community and my mom said it was the best Greek food she has tried outside of Chicago.  it has never let me down and is the only great place I will go to in town for Greek.  The family that owns this restaurant are all extremely nice people and it shows when you walk in the door with their warm welcome and smiling faces."}
{"text":"Huge portions...I had the gyro with a side salad and could only make it halfway through...but it was really tasty!

Friendly people, cute ambience...my one complaint was that I ordered a glass of Pinot and they served me merlot.  But it was a large serving and I wasn't at a nice steakhouse or anything, so I didn't complain!"}
{"text":"Finally, a decent spot in Henderson!

Greek lasagna - rich and creamy, good to share
Gyro - pretty good but next time I'll probably try another dish"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small with a beautiful picture of a coastal city. There are several beers available, plus greek coffee (similar to espresso) as well as their food menu which includes salads, sandwiches, desserts, etc. 

I opted for the falafel wrap and my boyfriend had the gyro platter with the lemon potatoes. We had a baba ganoush appetizer to start, which tasted fresh with a nice eggplant flavor but smelled strongly like peanut oil. It came with soft fluffy pita bread and crispy pita chips. My falafel wrap was alright, with lots of crumbly falafel balls inside of it. It came with a greek salad, which I had wrapped on the side so I could take it for my lunch at work. I enjoyed the salad, especially the fresh dressing that seemed to be made in house, but it was essentially a standard greek salad. My boyfriend was a bit disappointed with his platter, which came with meat strips, the potatoes, salad and sauces. He felt that it was over priced for what it was. 

The mythos beer is nice and light, goes well with the flavors in the food.

The service was pleasant and our food came out fairly quickly. The main reason I didn't rate it higher is because the price seemed high compared to similar restaurants in the area and how unremarkable my boyfriend found his meal."}
{"text":"One of the only local spots or food spots that I've rated a perfect 5 stars! Yes I'm pretty picky and have strict standards with how I rate food quality, taste, ambiance, and most importantly service. I may not be Greek, but I wished I knew someone who was to show me a better spot than this joint. Actually, not really. This place is the spot I bring friends, coworkers, and family to when they want real good home cooked Greek food. Best tasting big & juicy chicken gyros and awesome seasoned fries with yummy tzatziki sauce! From their hummus, to the other dishes I dare try not to misspell...this place is a must dine! Friendly service and reasonably priced. Only locals know where the best Greek food is in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Side salads nothing short of delectable. Gyro and kabob were incredibly flavorful. Fun environment, pleasant servers, overall a wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I had the chicken gyro with french fries and they were delicious. The gyro was phenomenal and the  was very filling. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been here twice. You get a gyros and a lot of fries for 9 bucks. The gyros are excellent and we love the seasoning on the Greek fries. The service is always fast and courteous. Parking kind of sucks if you want to be right in front but there's tons in the adjacent Sunset Station lot. I really like this place. It's worth a visit. And the waiter was very handsome to boot. (My 14 year old categorized him as \"the hot Greek waiter...high praise)."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short and simple.


-Very welcoming 
-Authentic feel in the restaurant 
-AMAZING GYROS"}
{"text":"best greek food i've tried in henderson (out of 3 places).  fiancee loves it."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some chicken soulvaki so on the way home from a shopping trip to Walmart, I decided to check it out since I had driven past it soooo many times. It's very small on the inside, but clean, and beautiful. I ordered my dish to go since I had some perishables in the vehicle I had to get home.  I ordered the chicken soulvaki plate which came with a greek salad, your choice of potatoes (i had the greek potatoes), chicken, and a soft pita. The pita, as other posters have mentioned is really soft and fresh, homemade tasting. The food tasted great, but the portion size for the $13.99 I paid was shocking.  Yes, it was to-go, but still...I'm used to paying about $10.00 for the same back home and the portion size is huge. It came in a styrofoam takeout container with the chicken in the larger area, the greek salad in the smaller area, and greek potatoes in the smallest...there were 3 quarters of potatoes.  The food is good, but I think they overcharge slightly based on what you actually get. Maybe it's larger if you dine in, but I'm not sure. I may or may not go back."}
{"text":"I go here weekly now, especially like the seasoned fries and the gyro. The rice pudding is very good also. The people who run this place are very friendly to the customers and provide great service everyone helps out. The only downside to this place would be the location, it is hard to find. Once you find it though you will be going back like I do I bet."}
{"text":"Been going here for around 8 years now. I've never had a bad meal. Hands down one of the best places to eat in town.  Everything on the menu is great you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"A gyro craving hit me today, so I went on a mission. Greek Bistro was the second place we hit, after the first didn't pan out.

The restaurant is very cute. All sorts of kitschy \"Greek\" stuff, with lots of blue and murals. You can tell its family-owned, which can be good and not so good. I almost felt like an intruder. The waitress/cashier was not too personable (adjusting the chairs we had just stood up from and pushed in, etc).

We got two traditional gyros to go. $8.99 for each combo (gyro and fries), slightly on the high side, but definitely not outrageous. The gyros were big and so good! The meat was perfectly cooked, the tzatziki was good and the veggies weren't mush. The portion of fries was huge and covered in Greek seasoning. Not the greatest, but in line with fries I've had at other gyro places.

Craving - satiated!"}
{"text":"This place has been my gyro staple for that last decade.  I went on a gyro walk about a few years ago and ate a gyro at virtually every gyro spot in the valley (off the strip obviously) and this place easily finishes towards the top.  Consistently good and locally owned, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"My all time fav and new weekly craving is the chicken gyro with fries. Best fries in THE world! When I'm in the mood for salad I go with the chicken gyro salad. Been to other Greek places but never as good as Greek Bistro!"}
{"text":"Today I went here with some friends that were visiting from out of town for lunch and I was very impressed with this place. The food was really good than I expected. I don't go out for Greek Food often but I will definitely be coming back as many times as possible. The gyro sandwiches and fries were to die for!"}
{"text":"Oh my...gyro salad was DELISH!  Price was less than most other Greek places in town also (buy at least $2)...the place is definitely a dive, but hey, who cares!  The food is good, quick, and nice employees"}
{"text":"Went to the Greek Bistro for the first time today after seeing Spider-Man with my buddy Steve. He's been talking up this place. I see why. The service was friendly and the food was fantastic. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Had the lamb Gyro with seasoned fries and I have to say one of the best I've had in town."}
{"text":"We enjoyed coming into this place. My bride picked this night and I was happy that it wasn't her usual Outback. It is definitely a small family run business. We were seated and our waitress came over. She was available to answer my questions and our orders were taken. We enjoyed a appetizer of falafel. Never having tried it before, it was crispy on the outside like a hush puppy and warm flavorful on the inside. Thought it was pretty good. It was served with slices of tomato. We both ordered gyro's. My better 9/10's had the chicken and I had the original. They both came with a huge amount of herb covered fries. Almost too much! The fries were really good and hot. We each enjoyed the gyro's. It had great flavor and was packed full with meat and vegetables. The greek sauce is wonderful. Great flavors all around! When we were almost done we talked with the \"mom\" of this place and she was delightful. She gladly answered our questions and inquired about our meal. Very pleasant. We will come back to this place because the food is legit and the \"mom & pop\" feel of the place is great."}
{"text":"Very friendly people, service was excellent and the food was amazing! I ordered the Gyro Traditional, it had a lot of meat and the pita was soft. I will definitely come back again. The best Gyro in town."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a million times, but never stopped. It's tucked away in a modest strip mall, somewhat of a hidden gem. I strolled in on a whim, and ordered the filet mignon souvlaki dinner. It was incredible. The steak was perfect, and the salad was fresh and delicious. Nice large portion, and I had a huge baklava for desert, which was perfect. Great place, and very good service. Good value. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best hummus I have ever had. Great family run restaurant. Food was like being in Greece."}
{"text":"Tiny little bistro, so it's not fast food, but it's good and the prices are right.  Quite possibly one of the best Greek salads I've ever had. Atmosphere is fun; family owned and operated and this place is bustling at 2 pm! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm baklavaaaaa, sorry got ahead of myself!

We were out and about in Henderson and I remebered reading yelp reviews of the Greek Bistro. So we decided to do late lunch. Great customer service, good ice tea! Lol always important! We had....

Spanikopita: it was good, not great, but good. Salad was fabulous! Watch for pits in olives. A great salad dressing, one that i have never had before. 

Gyro: very good tender meat and the tzatziki and fries holy cow so great! 

And the baklavaaaa, yes you have to sing it, was out of this world, straight out of the oven! Best honey I have ever had light and crunchy. When he put it on the table it screamed TADA!

Overall a great light cool meal on a hot day! We will be back...."}
{"text":"This is our go to Greek spot.  Hubby always gets the traditional gyro with feta fries.  I go back and forth from a gyro or falafel.  I usually add on their hummus or tzatziki with pita chips and bread.  Love that they give you both.  Their Spanakopita is another one of my favorites.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Service hasn't been a issue.  We live close so we almost always get it to go.  We are lucky to have several good Greek restaurants in the area.  Even with those we always find ourselves back here."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here. The food is always so fresh and so good. The service is good and because this is a family owned place, they treat you like family. We will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Cute little neighborhood Greek restaurant! Nothing pretentious ......you go to the counter order your food it's  cooked delicious and served to table ,fresh with reasonable prices. The staff are well versed in the menu and offer recommendations perfectly. Tasty quick and affordable. Worth the wait for a table!"}
{"text":"This is the first place my wife and I went to when we first arrived in Vegas, we went as a recommendation from our real estate agent. We now take our friends and family here whenever they come into town because it is the best Greek food we have ever tasted. The pita bread is the best, so fresh and so tasty! The gyros are fantastic, and my coworkers rave about the lasagna! The service is always prompt and courteous, just a great local place to visit if you're in the Henderson area! Oh and don't forget to get the hummus and pita ..... YUMMMMMMM!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like Greek, this will be a go to from now on!  The menu is simple, but everything is house made.  The moussaka is absolutely amazing, the chicken souvlaki is killer, and the hummus is some of the best I've had.  I have never had a bad meal here, and the owner is sweeter than her baklava."}
{"text":"Seriously good Greek food! Been to most of the Greek places in town, and I think this is by far the best. The chicken souvlaki plate, gyros, and falafel are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Greek food. We had the hummus and eggplant appetizers and the gyro salad. All were tasty and the service was good. Priced right with ample portions."}
{"text":"I love the Greek Bistro, I've been coming here since it opened and I've never had a bad meal, everything is always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"POOR POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

Seriously. Their credit card machine was broken and they failed to tell me that before I ordered my food (waiting patiently for it to be prepared). When it was time to pay, I was unable to due to their faulty machinery. The girl at the front asked me to give her multiple cards, none of which worked (I didn't have cash on me).

After I had been standing there for 20 minutes waiting for this girl to try and figure out the machine, the owner walked over, wondering what was taking so long. They tried again and were unable to fix it. 

Then, the owner had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to drive across the street to go to the ATM. ABSOLUTELY NOT! I obviously have other things to do since I ordered my food to-go. And after making me wait 25 minutes due to your screw up, comping me an $8 gyro doesn't seem like that great of a loss (especially since it was probably gonna get thrown out anyway). 

Never coming back. They don't deserve my business."}
{"text":"This is a cute mom amd pop type place. Gyros meat is juicy and the fries are great tasting. This is my favorite place when i'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in the vegas area. After a week of eating on the strip we ended up here. Tasty and cheap. Food was quick to our table. I ordered the Musaka and the chicken salad. I highly recommend both."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and the lamb especially tender and yummy! The place is clean and tidy and located in a convenient place with ample parking. The food server was very attentive and checked on us often."}
{"text":"I have been going to Greek Bistro for the last two years, and the food is great. Their fries are tasty too. As of late, the service has been sub par. The last two times we arrived at 7:30 and 8:30, and the owners were rude to us. They kept staring at us while we ate. We felt uncomfortable as they served us or took our requests as they seemed to be in a hurry to close up shop and leave. We left around 8:30 and 9:07 (they close at 9). They also charged us for yogurt sauce they failed to put on the gyro. It is disappointing to go to one of our favorite spots and be treated this way. I will no longer go here and frequent Crazy Pita instead."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Greek place in town. I get sad on Sunday's that they aren't open for my fix! Fresh gyros, yummy tzatziki sauce and friendly service. Love going to this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek place in all of Vegas and Henderson. Incredible gyros, fries, tzitziki, and pita. Fantastic service - the owners are kind folks. It's a great value too. 

If I lived closer, it'd be hard not to go every week."}
{"text":"Freaking fantastic. I loved, loved the greek french fries. The best fries outside of Canada. (And if you have never eaten in Canada you need to go and try any restaurant there.)

A young man helped me out, should have asked his name. He was very polite and brought me water after I told him no thank you. I did appreciate his thoughtfulness after the fact.

Sorry for not taking a picture. The food looked and tasted so delish I just started eating. ;)

Honestly I wish more restaurants served crispy non greasy fried food. I have no idea how they made everything on my plate taste so good, just happy they did.

If you haven't been here yet you need to go, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I usually get the chicken gyro with greek fries. The chicken tastes good with a fresh pita, the fries are seasoned well and taste great."}
{"text":"Good good food, good portion for the price paid, clean bathroom and restaurant.  Good customer service!"}
{"text":"Excllent casual dining, delivery and take out option. Food is flavorfull, well seasonsed and fresh. Service was friendly and quick. Ambiance is fine and they do delivery through various apps."}
{"text":"The traditional gyro is awesome!! Both myself and the wife loved it. Mine came with fries. Tasty. My wife got the side salad. Great salad with lots of feta.
Super friendly . A definite favorite place for gyros."}
{"text":"This Greek bistro I've been going to for over 7 years now. I love the service and the food is just as good! Everytime I walk in the owner remembers me and gives me the best of service. I've tried probably half of their menu and I'd have to say it's one of the most legit Greek /Mediterranean restaurants I've been to. If you haven't tried it then stop by, you don't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Mousaka this side of Astoria.  Lovely hard working, husband and wife owners.  If you are craving Greek food in Henderson/Las Vegas, this is the place! Home made Baklava was also excelkent"}
{"text":"This food is very amazing. It is packed with so much flavor. The Greek gyro is so good and it goes good with the Greek fries."}
{"text":"Once our ordered was taken it was 45 minutes before we received our food we didn't order anything elaborate just two gyros with fries. Service was not great our drink glasses were empty 5to 10 minutes before they were refilled...The food is very good but definitely not worth the wait. probably will not return"}
{"text":"Great Food. We have noticed that most of the people here are repeat customers and the owner takes the time to greet everyone one of them. Will go there again."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the positive Yelp reviews. I can honestly say that we were not disappointed in the least! It's in a little strip mall, which is scary at first but once you sit down, you will feel right at home! The service is excellent and the gyro is probably the best I have ever had! They serve a lemon potato with the gyro plate that everyone has to try. Before you leave, don't forget to save room for the baklava dizzled with honey!"}
{"text":"In the shadow of Sunset Station stands my favorite Greek spot in the city!   Incredible food, great family run restaurant.  

I've eaten here many times, everything is fantastic. From start (salad) to finish (rice pudding) the flavors are spot on and you know there's a ton of love put into each and every plate.  

Fantastic job, Greek Bistro!  I will be back multiple times!"}
{"text":"Great food awesome service,there's not 1 thing bad on this menu. The meat is beyond moist both chicken and lamb."}
{"text":"Back in Henderson and brought the family to Greek Bistro.  Family friendly and excellent food.  I am picky and this doesn't disappoint.  Top quality - fresh ingredients - good service."}
{"text":"The food may be a little pricey, but it is good to keep me coming back. I come to this place regularly. Love the seasoning they have on the fries. The flavoring on the gyro is good too.  Napoleon dessert fits my taste. It's not too sweet, light and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Super clean, standard Grecian blue and white interior, laid out like a mom and pop eatery. 
Service is expedient and friendly. Food is middle of road good. I had the lamb kebab served with, Greek salad, pita and lemon potatoes. It was filling and tasty. The rice pudding is American style dessert where the emphasis is on sugar. The rice was baby food soft instead of al dente, but if you're into sugary milk stuff, this you."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to the Greek Bistro. Last time, I had the falafel wrap and greek fries. My Mom had a gyro salad. In addition, we got baklava and hummus to go. Both of us loved our food. The wraps/pita are so good. I went back tonight and got the chicken gyro and greek fries. It was just as yummy and good as last time. This is definitely my favorite greek restaurant in the area. I am definitely planning on going back again"}
{"text":"Personable and friendly service. Walked in and placed a take out order. Nice people at the counter. Smelled good. Not too long of a wait at all for a walk in. Alexandrian vegetable vegetarian meal was delicious. Roasted veggies in phyllo dough. Mousaka was good tasting but just a little greasy on the bottom. Will go back again to try something different and a dessert."}
{"text":"Some of the best Greek food I've had in Las Vegas so far!! I really enjoy the small atmosphere and the staff is like very friendly!"}
{"text":"This was my second time, third time for my wife at this restaurant and we don't mind driving from anywhere in Las Vegas to go eat here. The best lamb shank i ever had in this country and seems like the Mediterraneans know how to cook the lamb. We had to call in before get there to make sure they still have their lamb shank because sometimes they get huge orders and they run out of those very quickly. Their gyros are very juicy and their fries are unique because they put sesame seeds in their seasoned fries. Also, if you have never tried a Greek beer this is a good place to do so."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Best lamb shank ever! My experience of this meal is the polar opposite of that of the lamb itself. Actually, the lamb's ghost should feel honored by how good a dish was made of it."}
{"text":"I can eat here everyday. This place is absolutely amazing. I also love the owner. Great food great place. Amazing"}
{"text":"The gyro's are super delicious and I would give this restaurant 4 stars but my experience here has always been subpar. I use the deal on groupon for Greek Bistro the last 3 times and the owner gives you a very rude face upon presenting the groupon. 

The food is good, but I probably won't go back because of the attitude they display."}
{"text":"Food was great & the prices were very competitive. The gyros were humongous and filled with lots of meat  also got the falafel salad and mmmm boy was that amazing!! Will most defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve Lunch for work I ordered the Lamb Shank plate. It was my second time ordering it super yummy and one of the best Lamb I have ever had!! We are pretty much hooked here. If you want some real Greek food this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok at best... went in there a few days ago and ordered fries and was charged extra for ketchup I've never in life been charged extra for ketchup to go with fries smh...."}
{"text":"Very friendly and unassuming. Great food. Not fancy but great food.  They just want you to be happy. Give it a spin you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the Greek Bistro for years. Family owned and operated! They always remember us when we come in. We are always greeted and seat quickly!..

The service is great and the food is excellent! My son and I usually get the gyros and my wife gets the souvlaki! Their food is fresh and hot!

If you love Greek food, you will love the Bistro!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding.  LOVE IT.  I have a disabled husband and the handicap access is at the end of the row of businesses.  he would have very far to walk and would be exhausted once he got inside.  But he loved the food and so did I....the Greek Salad was fresh and made to order and so was our meals...He had the Shrimp with spinach rice and I had a gyro platter...no complaints...I will just pick up our food from now on..."}
{"text":"Best Greek place in town. Great service. Amazing food! Don't normally come out of my comfort zone but I'm soooo glad I did ! I will be coming back !"}
{"text":"As of today, this is still the best Greek / Mediterranean food I have tasted in Clark County, although I admit I haven't been to too many such establishments. It's a tiny, quaint little place with some fitting ethnic decorations on the walls and Greek colors over the tables.

The first thing you'll notice about this joint is that it is very much a mom and pop establishment. The food is VERY home cooked and you'll taste it right away. The owner is a Greek lady who is generally a very nice host--but she may fuss a bit over Groupons-- just a warning. You'll also be pleased to find that the servings are quite generous. The wraps are all very filling and come with a heap of delicious seasoned fries. I barely finished the platter when I ordered it for dinner recently. 
The greek salad is mouthwateringly delicious and she sure doesn't skimp on it. 

As for the gyros, arguably the staple of any place with \"Greek\" in the title, they are the best I have ever tasted. Seriously. You'll immediately notice a difference in the meat that she uses, as well as the authentic Tzatziki sauce that she puts in them. If you order gyros around town at casual fast food places, you'll very easily notice the superior quality of this one. I've also had the Kefka (kabob) and the chicken wraps which were both quite pleasing. 

You usually spend about 12-14 dollars per person here, and I hope that doesn't discourage some of you cheaper yelpers out there. Sure, you could probably go get another gyro for half the price within a few miles but the extra few dollars are well worth it for by the superior quality of the food. There is a little bit of a wait, but take satisfaction knowing that it's time spent cooking and preparing your meal freshly."}
{"text":"We both had the Greek lasagna huge portions and fresh out of the oven. Salads were good too. First time there and it was pretty empty at 5 pm on a Friday night. Beers were only a reasonable $2.50 and $3.50. A bottle of decent wine about $20. I opted for the ice tea but no lemon. Returned and wife had chicken kabobs looked yummy. I stuck with the Greek lasagna huge."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a place worth a 5 star rating.  This little place has the best Gyro I've ever had. We had to order more than we could eat so we could try quite a few things. We ordered traditional and chicken gyros, order of hummus and an order of fries....all excellent! I'll be coming back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time having a gyro, the meat was so tasty, veggies couldn't have been more fresh and the tzatziki sauce was the best part of it all! Seemed like they took time and care with their cooking.
My boyfriend has had many gyros and says this was the best by far he's had.
Good service and they even had the hockey playoffs on I'll definitely come here again"}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up some lunch and am glad I did. When I walked in they had a good amount of customers and I was greeted right away by a nice man. I told him I wanted to place a order to-go and he handed me a menu and said I could sit down and take my time going over the menu. After placing my order, I was told it would be 10-15 minutes because it was being made fresh. I didn't have to pay until my order was ready and the man helping me was very courteous, welcoming and inside was clean. 

Chicken Salad ($10.75) - Chicken, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, olives, feta cheese and dressing. The salad was a good portion and the lettuce was very fresh and crisp. I was impressed with the amount of chicken and it tasted so good! I could just eat that chicken alone it had such great flavor. There was 3 pieces of tomato and 2 cucumber slices which was a bummer, I'd have liked more veggies. The menu said the pita bread would be warm, but the pieces were cold. I'm a huge fan of the salad over at The Great Greek (just down the street at Marks and Warm Springs) because of the amount of veggies they put in it and they also include grilled pita bread which I prefer to the cold. While I really liked the version here at Greek Bistro and was full and satisfied, I feel TGG has them beat in that department. I did ask for a side of tzatziki sauce and it wasted very good! 

Baklava ($4.25) - Delicious! The piece was huge, sweet and the perfect dessert! When I first saw it, I thought it might be too sweet. It wasn't too sweet at all and the top part was lightly crisp and the bottom was gooey good. Try this!

Since I liked the chicken and tzatziki sauce so much I can see my regular being a chicken gyro here and will give it a try on my next visit. They make your order fresh, so calling ahead can cut down your wait time some. Catering is also available."}
{"text":"Wednesday night and Earl wanted Greek food.  We drove over to Great Greek, but sadly, the place was closed.  I yelped and it suppose to be open!  WTH?  I called and the recording mentioned that they will be closing from blah blah to blah blah.  Therefore, we defaulted to Greek Bistro.

I got the gyro sandwich with fries, and Earl got the chicken salad with a side of falafel (appetizer).  The falafel appetizer came with babaganoush and slices of pita.  

I really enjoyed my food.  I ate half of it and was super full already.  Earl ate the rest of the gyro.  My sandwich was stuffed with delicious tender, flavorful slices of gryo.  I also liked the greek fries with the yogurt dip.  Yummy!

Earl's salad was a salad.  

Overall, we are fans of Greek Bistro and will always be on our to go to for Greek food."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars! I come here all the time and it's literally the food of the Gods! I always either get the filet mignon or the lamb!!! It comes with literally the best tasting rice, salad, and the sauce for the meat is AMAZING! It's always a hit or miss for me but they're doing it right. Their pita bread that comes with the meal is also phenomenal. It's the perfect softness and the bread just melts in your mouth. They have it so perfect here. If you want to try Greek food for the first time, this is THE place to be! The owner of this place is also very sweet! She checks up on everyone often :)"}
{"text":"I went there with my few friends and we enjoyed the food and service and nice family welcoming restaurant.everything was awesome and worth to wait and enjoy.i definitely going back and will do catering for my parties with this restaurant"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Efficient service with a smile. Server was happy to produce separate checks for our group. I had the garlic shrimp over rice and spinach with raisins and almonds. Sounds odd but it was great! Greek owners and several Greek customers which is usually a good sign."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer, I was intending to go to the other Greek café down the street, but found it closed.  Gratefully, I found this little gem!  We had the gyro and fries, soup and the falafel platter.  Everything was delicious and well seasoned.  All items were fresh, (as the owner explained, nothing is frozen), and all items are individually prepared from her personal recipes.  Couldn't be much better, especially with a menu that contained other Greek and Mediterranean specialties such as leg of lamb.  While the servings were ample, the desserts, rice pudding and cheesecake are something to save room for.  The server was a very nice older lady, just like mom.  In fact, the entire experience was like being invited to the owner's house while she prepared delicacies from her kitchen.  Definitely worth a try...I will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to check Greek Bistro out after seeing some of the reviews on Yelp and I'm glad I did. It's a perfect hidden gem just outside of Sunset Station and I drove past it the first visit.

-the interior is decked out in the blue and white colors of the Greece flag and is very bright and clean, no dim lighting to hide anything here. Greeted by a woman who may be the owner we were given a menu and she answered all of our questions.

-I had my usual Greek favorite, salad with Gyro meat on top. A very large portion of lettuce, tomato, onions feta, olives and topped with Gyro meat and served with dressing and tzatziki sauce. It was very good and definitely filling. I tried one of my wife's falafel balls and these were also excellent

-There are many Greek places in the area and this ranks up there with the best of them. I will be going here frequently!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place when we lived in Hendertucky, way before spots like Thelma's, Penn's, and Great Greek existed.

This was plan B after Great Greek had closed up shop due to selling out of food!?!?!(that's what we were told) We shared an Avgolemono, Wifey got the Chicken Gyro with Greek Fries, and I decided to go with the owner's suggestion of the Moussaka.

The Avgolemono was okay, but we preferred Great Greek's version better. However, we preferred the Gyro and fries here, even though the portion was a bit smaller, Greek Bistro still gets our vote. The seasoned fries with the yogurt dip are so addicting! The Moussaka came with a side salad and was very delicious and quite filling.

Greek Bistro is a great alternative if Great Greek is closed for the day and you're craving some Greek grindage...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Ohh this place was yummy. Their Greek fries were very interesting in a good way I'm really glad I got them. I had the gyro without tomatoes it was a very good gyro like I was expecting. I'd go again"}
{"text":"Great food probably the best Gyro in Henderson.  Comes with fries or a Greek salad, both sides are good.  I have tried the skewers and they are also awesome.

Consistent food quality / quantity, I have never been disappointed and I have been a customer for years.

I Love the wall murals, I've been to Santorini and there is no place on earth like it."}
{"text":"I love this place,the food portions are a nice size,the veggies are fresh and the meat is always so tasty.The staff is so friendly and they always do a great job of getting you in and out quickly when your order is to go.My order has never been incomplete and the menu selection is large but not so large that it is hard to decide what you want."}
{"text":"The best gyro meat I've ever had. The pita is so soft. The tzatziki appetizer and their salads are to die for. So so so good! Mine and my husbands favorite place to eat. I'm part Greek, raised by a Greek family, and this definitely reminds me of my family's cooking. And it's a family owned business, and they're very personable. They always remember us and chat with us when we go there."}
{"text":"Yum, yelp you didn't fail me here. We have been a fe times and it is great! We have gone here a few times, and everything is great. We drove 10 miles out of the way and didn't have a free steak lunch just to eat here. I have seen stuff staying it is expensive, but for what you get in quality and service it is worth it. I had a glass of wine a gyros on the last visit and it was just 25.00 with a healthy tip. I love small family places and this doesn't disappoint, all fresh all good. I saw someone have the lamb shank and next time that is what we will get. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently. As always, food and service were great. Had lamb shank, heaven!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. My only complaint is I ordered a chicken kabob ala carte... What I recieved was three small pieces of chicken in a box.... I am pretty sure when ordering a kabab meal you get more than three pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for Greek food.... delicious... super clean... nice and cozy place... great and friendly service.... highly recommendable....!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy great food, then this restaurant is perfect! Everything about it is very Greek.  The staff is Greek - the tzatziki sauce, the baklava, the atmosphere - it's all bursting with Greek and that is why it's our number one Greek place!!"}
{"text":"I'd give Greek Bistro 3.5 stars. The koobideh was tender, juicy and tasty. I'd definitely go back just for that. The gyro/gyro plate were both average. 

It's a nice addition to the restaurants in Henderson. There aren't enough family run spots and this is one I'd recommend to people looking for some good koobideh."}
{"text":"This is a little family operated, hole-in-the-wall place in a strip mall. We've been coming here for several years. We always get the traditional gyro with the side Greek salad. It's always outstanding. I'm sure it's the best Greek food in Las Vegas but I really wouldn't know since we never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went here after Golf and oh boy they make a really good Gyro. Pita was one of the best I ever had. Pita was so good I got them to make me a couple to take home."}
{"text":"Awesome. Full recommendation. Simple menu. Tasty food. Great prices. I have enjoyed lunch and dinner here. Best gyro in Henderson. Customer service is second to none."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! Fresh & delicious and the prices were good too! I had a a grilled chicken gyro and really enjoyed it. Vegetarian dishes too."}
{"text":"Everything my wife and I have tried here has been amazing! When we get a craving for Greek food, Greek Bistro is the place to go. The food and service is always great."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Greek food--I ate the gyro salad which was filling but also didn't weigh me down for my afternoon errands. Service was alright as well--seems like a family run place so I don't mind seeing the servers sit down to eat their own meal. Hard for me to believe that at least three Greek restaurants can be supported in this one tiny section of town, but it works because each is delicious."}
{"text":"Can't say enough.
Food is fantastic.  Had the gyro.  

Pita chips and humus, also great.  

Treated me like family.

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I've been in this place multiple of times now. It's ran very professionally plus the food looks and smells amazing! This family owned restaurant is definitely a place worth checking out! With the volume this restaurant does and the pace of the service provided it's no wonder why this restaurant is the talk of the town! Check it out guys.... they won't disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"This is a definite stop for us when in the area of Galleria Mall. My favorite place for a tasty gyro,  my choice being the chicken which is perfectly grilled breast. Love the fries and the salad is amazing, dressing very good. Their souvlaki is the best I've ever had and traditional Greek fare is always complimented by others I bring here from out of town. Try their falafel, you'll not be disappointed, seasonings are perfect. If you have some room and a sweet tooth, the desserts are surprisingly delicious. Something here for everyone wanting Mediterranean fare. Nazik is always friendly and we look forward to seeing her after our drive from Boulder City."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, chicken gyros were flavorful, and service was decent. Waitress forgot to bring out humus  appetizer before entrees."}
{"text":"The lamb shank and the moussaka is awesome. I've been coming here for years. Top Greek place in Las Vegas/Henderson. Very underrated."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The best tzadziki sauce I've ever had! Not to mention the authenticity of the flavors here. If you are looking for great Greek food, this place is a must! Yum!"}
{"text":"Open kitchen layout. Authentic. Clean. Super family feel and friendly service. Offered me extra meat if I was still hungry!  Good ice tea refills. Very pleasing"}
{"text":"Very good food. Beautiful presentation. Family-owned with pride and care. Clean visible kitchen area. Clean dining area and bathroom too. Only caution would be if mildly spicy red peppers are not your thing, just let them know to go easy when you order. They are very accommodating. The chicken soup and Greek salad could easily be a whole lunch meal or even dinner for a light eater. Although they don't prepare the pita dough, they do bake it on the premises. We were again very pleased with our experience. We try to eat here whenever we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everytime I eat there the food is perfect. They are always polite, fast service, great food. The baklava is AWESOME! The gyro...perfect. This family place is becoming a regular spot for me. I highly recommended it."}
{"text":"I still love this place...I want to provide an update because the owner is always so friendly. She makes you feel like you are a guest at her home. I want to eat here every other day!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star on the food but the phone system sucks. Waited 15 minutes on the phone to place a take out order for my BDay. I drove there still on hold....i had the waiter pick up the phone to answer my call on hold."}
{"text":"Ask for Raffi!
Excellent customer service and knowledge base coupled with impeccable manners. My gyro was perfect!
Thank you."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town.  

The gyro is fantastical.  The gyro player is great for sharing.  

I have been 100's of times over the years and have never had a complaint.  It's amazing they are still open as the location is horrific.  Once Nelson's custard closed next door I thought for sure they would be next.  

I have told them they need to open up in the mall or in a casino location.  The food is way to good to see them fail.  Especially with places like mad Greek and that place at the mall Kylos Greek cafe (horrible).  

If you want a family friendly great Greek food give them a try you won't be disappointed.  Oh Greek fry's are awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros and fries! Tried a few other Mediterranean. Places and this by far is the best!  Service is wonderful! It's worth the travel if your not close."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant after seeing all the positive reviews. Had the traditional gyro and it is DELICIOUS!! Meat is very tender and flavorful. Fries had a great seasoning. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the traditional gyro here. Personal favorite in all Vegas! As a recovering carnivore, this place always tempts me into relapsing. Been coming for a couple years, never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"So delicious... The hummus and pita..omg the rice!!  Lemon potatoes and Filet.  All so tasty. And the owner( I assume) was very sweet too. Thanks well be back!!"}
{"text":"under new ownership and food is still good.  Gyros are our favorites.  They have redecorated it and looks much better except the chairs need foam on the bottoms.  Their dolmades were good but a little bland - and I would have preferred to have Tzakaki with them instead of the sauce they provided.  Our only complaint is that the waiter had on so much after shave it left a smell around our table that didn't go with the good.  That affected our rating!  Its great for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had a terrific gyro and fries - also comes with a super fresh and tasty greek side salad --  wow.  Seriously delicous.  Wonderfully fresh.  

Service started out with a bit of attitude considering the joint was empty -- and we were a little skeptical when he said the gyro was the best in town -- but ya know, I think it was.  I've not tried all of them  yet, but it's not a bad aspiration if I were in serious need of weight gain (which sadly, I'm not) so I'll have to consider it a treat and good to know about in that wasteland of nothingness food-wise...

If you're really in the mood to splurge, they have plenty of Greek dessert options, or you can get frozen custard at Neilson's next door who's stopped making sandwiches, probably because the Greek Bistro's are too good to compete with...  

ahhh summer...."}
{"text":"Read a small review in the RJ and liked the idea of family owned and operated.  Decided to try there for dinner and as a bonus found a 15% off coupon on line.  Was not disappointed.  Falafel, gyro, chicken greek salad were all fresh and homemade. As was the humus and yogurt dip for the french fries.  Oh, and the seasoned fries were great too!!  Will definitely return.  Please try it and support the mom & pops in our area."}
{"text":"This is one of the closest restaurants to where I've called home for over 5 years, and I hadn't ever tried it. Today, I told myself \"no more excuses.\"

Yes, I finally went to Greek Bistro. It's exactly what it says on the tin: a small Greek restaurant, hidden in a small strip mall behind Wildfire Casino and on the outer circle of the \"ring\" surrounding Sunset Station. I stopped in after 1:30 for a late lunch, finding a surprising number of tables occupied but with plenty open for myself. The blue-heavy decor is charming in its way, but I would probably not order dine-in here if I wasn't so concerned about eating freshly prepared food.

[Rambling personal story warning!] I wasn't always as ambitious with trying unfamiliar businesses as I am now, and none of my friends ever invited me to try this place back in my first few years around. I finally did invite someone to try it with me around Christmastime 2015, but they had closed early on that evening, so I pushed it to the back of my mind again. Lately, I've found myself more and more frequently bemoaning the lack of great food on my side of Henderson, so I finally had to address one of the biggest potential counterarguments.

The young man who greeted me was quick with asking for my order and surprisingly quicker coming back around after I asked for some time to think about my order. Truth be told, I was stalling to take menu photos, a challenge that became far easier after a woman who is presumably the owner offered me a to-go menu. This version didn't have the reflective plastic cover that their standard menu does, and prices were consistent. And the food was good, even great at times.

I had the traditional gyro sandwich ($8.99) with fries, and the gyro was certainly one of the better ones that I've had to try. Delicious tzatziki and fresh lettuce, tomato, and red onions adorned the beef and lamb slices, which were still the star of the dish. The pita was solid, not exceptional. I was disappointed by the lack of salt in the fries themselves, which can only be covered up so far by the seasoning or by extra salt, and the surprising slight dryness of the fries' interior. The tzatziki was a fun dip for the fries though, and I found myself using the tzatziki to pick up seasoning from the bottom of the tray. That aside, I would order the small salad instead of the fries.

Dessert was better. The baklava ($4.25) is a surprisingly huge square-shaped portion that's roughly 3 inches per side. I would not recommend taking it on alone, and I even ended up asking for a to-go box despite (or because of) how much I enjoyed it. When you break into the baklava, honey oozes out of the crispy fillo dough with a layer of crushed walnuts inside and a garnish of crushed pistachios on top. The flavor is somehow richer and more nuanced than other baklavas that I've had in the past. I was very wrong about this neighborhood not having good desserts, and I'll be sure to try their other sweets now that I know where to look.

I also ordered a moussaka ($13.95) to-go. I hadn't had this dish in ages, but I'd always fondly remembered the eggplant and ground beef layered dish that I'd tried years ago, and this brought me back. Loved the spices in the moussaka as well as the side salad of lettuce, cucumber, red onion, tomato, and feta. There's an additional side of seemingly the same sauce that bathes the moussaka, and I wasn't sure what to do with it except just enjoy it slowly with every bite of the moussaka. The portion is a bit more of a huge lunch or solid dinner, so you might consider sharing it. Moussaka, baklava, and maybe an appetizer? Sounds like a great meal for two right there.

Greek Bistro is an enjoyable restaurant that may indeed be the gem of this mostly chain-ridden side of town. I'll definitely explore their menu further, and I won't wait another 5 years to do so."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This is one of our new favorite spots in Henderson. Not pricy and delicious food."}
{"text":"This is more of a personal emotional review. 

So I never really tried Greek food before. I had just came from kick boxing near by and I wanted to eat a healthy salad and my mom suggested this place. 

As soon as I walked in the scenery caught my eye. 
It was so beautiful. Blue and white and there large pictures of Greece. My Goodness I suddenly felt like there was apart of me that was missing all along. It really made me emotional. 

Being part Greek and not knowing the first thing about being Greek started to frustrate me. I didn't know what the sauces were or Falafel  it all looked so good and it was hard to choose. The lady who served us was beautiful and nice. She didn't speak much to us but she was very sweet. 

When our food arrived it looked amazing. Everything was fresh and perfect. The olives they put in the salad is so good. That homemade sauce was so BOMB!! I'll try that place at least once a week or once every two weeks. 

I was so urged to take pictures. 

Weird memory though it kind of smelled like old mop water but it was when I first walked in. It wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Like others said, this is a great family owned business. The food was really good, and there is a lot of it! We started shared the greek salad which was a great appetizer for 2 people. I had the traditional gyro and my wife had the chicken gyro, both with fries. It was too much food for 2 people, neither of us finished all of the fries. We had a $25 restaurant.com certificate which stated we had to spend at least $37.50, which is why we ordered so much food. We ordered beer and wine also so we did hit the minimum we had to spend. At first the older female owner (the same in previous reviews) took the coupon and said it didn't apply to the beverages. But I showed her in the description that is doesn't state that, just that we had to spend $37.50. She went to the back and after a few minutes came back and said ok, but didn't seem too thrilled about it. She was still very nice though and seemed to appreciate our business. 

The traditional gyro is the best! My wife and I agreed that it was better than the chicken. And the pita bread is delicous. The greek salad was really good and so were the fries. If you're looking for a great gyro this place is a must. We will definitely go back in the future (and order less food)."}
{"text":"Love this family owned bistro. Best Greek food in Vegas. Trust me when I say it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp after a long flight cross country. We couldn't have been happier to find the best Greek food we've had in a long time! We can't wait to come back! This place is legit!! You know when you find local elderly greek women eating here on a Saturday night that it's authentic! The staff and owner couldn't have been nicer! 5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant! My husband and I found this place over a year ago, and we've been coming here almost 3 times a month since. The owner is so nice, and we always feel welcomed. They already memorize our order. I love everything on the menu, but I mostly order the chicken kabob plate or the kaftedakia plate. They're both so good!"}
{"text":"The Greek bistro is by far the best Greek restaurant in Las. Vegas, I have never had a bad meal always fresh"}
{"text":"My first time but definitely not my last. I had the gyro sandwich and Greek fries. The sandwich had just the right combination of meat, onion, tomato, and sauce. I had never had Greek fries before. They were very good. For dessert I had the baklava which was twice as big and twice as good as any other place."}
{"text":"Very welcoming with homemade food. Much care is taken into the food and service in this place. The owners know most of their patrons but are friendly to newbies as well. You get the feeling that they are cooking for you in the same way they would if you visited their home. Will return!"}
{"text":"The best Gyros and fries that I have eaten since I left Chicago.  Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"This family Greek restaurant is pretty good.  I go for the traditional gyro with a salad.  I have had the seasoned fries and those taste really good as well.  I'm not a big Greek fan but I do crave gyro's and when I do, I always come here.  Price is a little bit higher than I like, I think it was around $9/$10 for the gyro with salad.  Check it out, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yum, chicken gyro \"sandwich\" with greek salad. I don't know what they put on that salad but it's so yummy, I'm not even tempted by the fries it's that good! Wonder if they'll do extra salad instead of the pita, will find out and if they do they're getting 5 stars! Chicken is delicious, not dry one bit, seasoning is on point! Decor could use a little help but that's about it."}
{"text":"WOW!  Got the gyro salad and it was amazing!! Nice little family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"The best gyros in town!!! The pita bread itself has a good flavor to it, unlike the generic pita breads out there...the chicken greek salad and the hummus are also good it makes you want to come back!!! Great staff and a great, clean place to eat...Highly Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Just what the Doctor ordered! Needed a new Greek spot since relocating to Henderson. Quite impressed! I'll definitely be back to this place. Chicken gyro was on point.. I couldn't decide on my side so o
I got both, and they both exceeded my expectations. The Greek fries..YUMMY! The salad, refreshing!"}
{"text":"Yum! I'm an instant fan. Now I know of two awesome Greek restaurants near my house.

If you are dining in there are tables for sit down service. Take-out is either called in ahead ordered at the register in the back. We were doing take-out yesterday. 

Someone greeted us soon after coming in and asked if wanted to dine in or take-out. We grabbed a menu at the back counter, picked out our dishes, and ordered. Food pricing was reasonable and our food was ready to go in less than 10 minutes. It seemed like a friendly family run restaurant.

I ordered the Shrimp a la Greek. The sauce on the shrimp was good and I absolutely loved the bed of rice. The rice had almonds, spinach, fruit, and plenty of seasoning. It was one of the most addictive rices I've ever had. There was a nice amount of salad and the dressing was really good. The dressing was different than other Greek dressings I've had, but in a good way. The pita was really soft and nicely seasoned. I was definitely impressed with each part of this meal.

My husband had the Greek Plate which came with gyro meat, Greek potatoes, pita, and salad. He loved this meal. I sampled the Greek potatoes and thought they were well seasoned and delicious. We also had the Baklava, but that wasn't my favorite. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've had.

Greek Bistro is definitely one of my local favorites now. Yummy with great service."}
{"text":"Really good gyro! THe overall lunch had character with a more personal season."}
{"text":"I just happened to be hungry and at a store nearby.  I went in and waited while they prepared a carry out order and to be honest, I did not have high expectations.  I had never heard of this place.  When I got home, I wasn't impressed with their dolmades but I was blown away by their spanakopita.  It was the most unique kind I have ever had, not only with cheese and spinach, but delicious herbs and tomatoes.  Their salad was incredibly fresh and the dressing was delicious.  I'm definitely heading back."}

{"text":"I went here a few years ago but a lot came in between, so I am just getting back to this restaurant. To my delight, the food is as luscious as ever. I grew up in a city that has a lot of excellent Greek restaurants (Boston, Mass.)  so I know good from great .This one is great. I am a vegetarian, so I had the falafel wrap with its generous salad and the baba ganoush. WOW! Taste sensation! I intend to try the egg lemon soup next time and if I remember from the past the Spanakopita is outstanding. Can't wait. (Just have to stagger my visits. I want to go back every day, lol.)"}
{"text":"I love Greek food and can be quite picky about it. I was just in Greece last month and I must say the food here was even better than what I got in Athens! I got the traditional Gyro served with a Greek salad. My mom got the Moussaka. I love Moussaka as well so I took a taste of it. It was made perfectly and so delicious! My Gyro was awesome...it was very large and I ended up eating the entire thing. The salad was delicious as well. I will definitely visit again and I look forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Greek bistro is an excellent authentic Greek experience. We had the traditional gyro sandwich, one with salad and one with fries. The meat was extremely tender and delicious (cut from the spit). The pita bread was also soft, doughy and delicious.  The tzatziki sauce on the gyros sandwich was creamy and amazing. I thought the sandwich could have used a few more onions but my wife thought it was perfect. The Greek side salad was awesome (not just an afterthought) and the fries were delicious. The staff was extremely nice. For dessert we ate the Baklava, it was warm flaky, cinnamony and sweet and was possibly the best Baklava I have ever eaten.  The Greek Bistro had a very authentic Greek family feel to it's ambiance and was really a joy to have a meal at. This is our new spot for authentic Greek food.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I yelped this place and was not disappointed. The food was excellent. We had the humus appetizer and it was delicious. Some in our group got the traditional gyro and said it was the best they had ever had. Everything was delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely am never disappointed at any meal here.  One of my favorite places to eat out at; family owned and run with great food and though small, very friendly atmosphere. My family & I have been eating there since they opened & it has always been consistent with large helpings & everything cooked to perfection! Very clean & profesional, the gyro salad is so good & refreshing in this desert heat."}
{"text":"The food is good here but the owner or the lady that runs this place is abrasive and rude. She slammed my credit card on the counter and threw her order booklet down after she took my order and was not pleasant at all! So I asked her \"are you ok today cause you're usually really nice?\" And she yelled at me saying \"what did I do? What did I say to you? I have a headache! I'm not doing anything to you!\" So I sat down to wait for my order and she was still going on yelling while I had already walked away! SMH! I'm really disappointed with the service because I come here all the time and I do not wish to come back..."}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious food I have EVER had! I am so glad we took the chance to check this place out this past weekend while in Vegas. I will definitely make it a point to come back here during my yearly trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"yes, it's the best greek food in town, but the addition of the server (instead of perfectly acceptable counter service) has turned us off to this otherwise very good restaurant.

I was also disappointed that they refuse to honor their entertainment coupon published in entertainment 2009.  No explanation, just that they apparently decided not to honor it.

Despite the food being good, these issues mean we won't be back."}
{"text":"Best darned Greek food I've ever eaten. I come back here for another gyro every time I return to Vegas. Hopefully they're around forever."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been trying all if the amazing Greek food in this town but this place was soooo delicious. I had the Babaganoush app and the Moussaka for my entree. It was the best I've ever had! The people are super friendly and service was top notch. This restaurant has a very home style feel which I think makes the food taste even better! If you are looking for some tasty Greek food, head to this place. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in a long time!!! First time at this place and I will DEFINITELY be going back!"}
{"text":"Greet food great customer service, Clean, the owners are very nice and try to do their best.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My wife ordered the chicken souvlaki plate while I requested the gyro plate.  Each entrée included warm pita, a salad, rice pilaf and tzadsiki.  The chicken breast was juicy and my gyro meat was both ample and moist, but the side salad and pilaf were disappointing.  I tendered a 2/1 coupon from the Entertainment book, but we were told they stopped accepting the coupons in February, but would accept ours."}
{"text":"I was in the area with my friend and her daughter, so I figured it was a great opportunity to check out a new spot. Plus, I LOVE Greek food!

Falafel ($5.95): Appetizer version comes with four falafel, lettuce, tomato, pita bread, and tahini sauce. The falafel is DELICIOUS. The flavor and seasonings are so good, it almost makes me not want to eat meat (almost). I loved the tahini too.

Tzatziki ($5.55): A very generous portion of this popular Greek yogurt dip served with warm pita bread and small pita chips. I really enjoyed their version of tzatziki; perfect balance of flavors. Also, I thought it was so neat that you have options with soft, fluffy pita bread or crunchy pita chips. I preferred the bread with tzatziki, whereas the chips were fantastic with tahini.

Traditional Gyro ($8.99): Stuffed with the famous gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and of course, tzatziki. Stuffed is a pretty accurate description since this sandwich is HUGE! It's also delicious. It's served with Greek Fries or Salad (I opted for the fries). The fries have a wonderful seasoning on them, but lacked in salt and flavor. Not a difficult problem to fix with a little help from table salt, however, they still rated rather low on my \"Favorite Fries List.\"

My friend ordered the Chicken Gyro and fortunately, I tried their fantastic chicken! It's moist and very flavorful. Even the little one really enjoyed it. I rarely order chicken in Greek restaurants since I love gyro meat so much, but their chicken is convincing.

Service was great, too. The young gentleman assisting us was prompt with his service throughout our meal, accommodating, and very kind. He was so sweet with the baby!"}
{"text":"The prices are a little higher here than at other Greek restaurants, but I'm not complaining.  I've only eaten at the Greek Bistro once, but they served me the best gyro I've ever had.  The fries were terrific.  Normally I don't like fries that much, but the seasoning that they put on them is incredible.  The service was friendly and the food came out fairly quickly.  I'd like to get back sometime soon to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place out since it was so close to The Great Greek. The reviews are half what GG has but the stars came out to be about the same. It's a little slower paced here and not as prosperous as GG. Food wise, it is very tasty and cooked well. The service is very friendly. We ordered 3 traditional gyros and a chicken salad. Why 3 gyros? No one wanted to share theirs I guess, me included. The fries is crunchy and seasoned. There was no oily residue. The traditional gyro was made of lamb and beef that they ground into a pate meat. I was afraid it was prepackaged from Uncle Sam...Sam Walton that is (he of beat up pick-up for Wal-mart grand openings while family are each multibillionaire jetsetters fame). But the smarter half said that's how they make it, they put it through a grinder. You can see the kitchen from the counter so I suppose if you had no shame you can stand there and just watch them feed the machine. The dish came with a side of yogurt mayo kind of dressing which was perfect for the fries. I used both ketchup and the yogurt mix. The rest of my table preferred the yogurt only but I put ketchup on my fried chicken and rice sometimes so I slathered it in my fries of course. Relax, it's Heinz not Hunt's catsup. Overall, GG prob a tad better but this is not a bad alternative either. They have different dishes and both make their dishes well. The chicken salad was well made, seasoned grilled chicken, plenty of romaine lettuce (I think) and some tart olives to keep you awake in case you got a case of food coma. Prices are about the same as GG. We went in at about 5:30ish so there were plenty of tables, come 6pm, most of the tables were filled. One chicken salad, 3 gyros, and 2 beers came out to be around $44. I think the salad was about ~$10.95 and the gyros at ~$8.95.

Being a block away from each other maybe they know each other or are related? They had a cute/weird phrase above the counter....\"the heart of Greece lies in its food every bite is like a kiss.\" It might be one of the few times where I got lucky and didn't know about it. If I knew earlier, I would've brought my Chapstick."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this quaint, family owned restaurant during our short stay in Henderson, NV. My husband and I are foodies and health nuts who avoid chains at all cost. This place is a hidden gem that gives an appetizing taste of both Greek culture and flavor. We decided it was definitely one we would re-visit if we lived nearby.

The service was fast and friendly. Gyro Salad was huge and topped with a mound of very flavorful meat. Ask for tzatziki sauce on the side because they give you a large portion. Warm pita bread was also a delicious compliment to the meal...very good with the tzatziki sauce or hummus dip."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  From start to finish, this has become one of my most favorite restaurants in town. 

The family who owns the business are all so nice and helpful, and very, very welcoming.  The food is to die for as well- my favorite is their Shrimp a la Greek and my husband is hooked on their lamb shank.  Fresh Mediterranean salads on the side, and a sinfully delicious baklava to finish it all up... we leave full and smiling each and every visit.  You will too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic am great tasting gyro I have had amazing flavor down the fries , everything is literally so good!! I highly recommend this place. I'm a good guy I have excellent taste I promise you, YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD, TRUST IN MY REVIEWS.. the salads are amazing the grape leaf rolls are great the pita the tiziki everything is so good and i enjoyed the Greek ambiance the restaurant has to offer. MUST HAVE IF YOUR IN HENDERSON. If not it's worth the drive..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The food and service are always amazing. They always make me feel like a welcomed guest in their home. It's refreshing to find a quality, family owned business in Vegas. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just about 20 minutes after eating here my stomach hurts and I ate it yesterday and I've had stomach problems since YESTERDAY after eating here. 
I eat out a lot. I've never had a sensitive tummy. I can eat spicy food. I can eat just about anything and never get an upset tummy so it worries me that since yesterday after eating here I've been in pain. 
It has to be something pretty gross to have me feeling this way into the NEXT day?"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing and the owners are truly wonderful people. As long as they are there we won't go anywhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken gyro and fries I love it. Great spot for lunch or dinner. Nice people good service. Eat in or call in for pick on the way home. Either way try it out. Yum"}
{"text":"I love this place. My boyfriend and I go whenever we can. The food is always great and the service is great too. Highly recommend if you like good Greek food!"}
{"text":"Had the beef gyro--it was pretty good and was a large size. Not a fan of the fries. Baklava was possibly the worst I have ever had--tasted very old or burnt."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on Yelp I decided to give it a try especially since I would be shopping at Walmart and Lowe's just a very short distance away.
All the positive prior reviews were are absolutely correct. For a smaller establishment the seating is very amble as is the parking. For my first foray I decided to go with the classic gyro with side salad instead of fries. The gryo was so packed with quality meat that it was difficult to do justice to my salad. Next time I'll have them pack the salad to go. After all I needed to save room for dessert... so I decided to order the baklava. Without a doubt world class....5 stars. The Greek Bistro it's going to be one of my favorite local restaurants."}
{"text":"Started with the Hummus. It was amazing! Some of the best hummus I've ever had! Ate all of it. Then I had the Traditional Gyro with Greek fries. Delicious! Boyfriend had the Gyro Plate and he loved it. Great place, great food. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The Greek bistro is the perfect bang for your buck, the food, customer service, and amazing atmosphere with friendly faces. Greek Bistro's is a amazing restaurant with a focus on taste and food presentation, I haven't tried all the food options yet but I feel that the gyro and kabob is second to none with a colorful and tasty palette all at a affordable price and getting you filled right up every time. I've been coming to this restaurant 1-2 every other week , always meeting the same friendly faces every time I show up.  I would give a 6/5 if I can :)"}
{"text":"I came to this place looking for some good Greek but ended up finding the best koobideh/ground beef kabob in Vegas. Skip the expensive and always disappointing Persian restaurants. This is one of the best kabobs I've had and that's saying a lot since I'm Middle Eastern. Two huge kabobs and rice for only $13!! Cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Gyros here are so good! Flavorful and delicious. 
I love their Greek fries!!! They add tons of flavors to it- amazing!"}
{"text":"Best greek so far in Henderson !! Service always great.  Gyros, fries, avolemongo, pastistio, lamb shank, greek salads, i.e. everything on the menu... all done the right way!!!! We're regulars, never ever disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Excellent little Greek cafe hidden in a small strip mall next to Sunset Station. I love their Gyros and tiropita. The service is good and the prices are reasonable. Try the Greek fries with seasoning and feta cheese, wonderful. The portion sizes are fair for the price."}
{"text":"I love everything at the Greek Bistro but my favorite are the Gyro wrap (the meet is sooo fresh) and feta fries!!!!!!!!!!! I am from LA but when I go to Vegas my first stop is always at the Greek Bistro. Amazing food and best service. 

P.s.  I give 5 stars for the cleanness of the place, 5 stars for service, and 5 stars for the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp when I was in Henderson and figured I would give it a try for lunch.  It was located in a stripmall and was a little ...old looking.  I went in and the place was clean and the staff was really friendly.  I figured I would just try the plain gyro with a salad instead of fries, when it came out I was pretty surprised how big o a portion it was.  Everything about it was great, the gyro was one of the best I have had and the side salad was worht getting on its own."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended by a friend and we were not disappointed! Had the traditional gyro with fries very flavorful! My sister had the chicken gyro with fries and she loved it. Their fries are bomb dot com!! The staff/owners super friendly and attentive. Oh try their lemonade it was really good and I don't really like lemonade unless it has alcohol. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Still the best Greek food in Henderson.  Chicken Gyro sandwich is my favorite and French fries are amazing.  I tried everything on the menu.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Food was all very good. You can tell this is a family owned establishment. Very delicious"}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and we were not disappointed. Generous servings, food reached us pipping hot. Love the hot sauce. Definitely will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent local find. Service was excellent along with the food. Falafel gyro and the traditional gyro were outstanding, and their rice pudding desert is by far the best rice pudding I've ever had. Being a lover of Greek food, as well as having traveled to Greece, this is easily some of the best Greek food I've had."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST Greek food I've ever had! The best tzatziki ever! The pita chips and bread are delicious. The traditional gyro is great - in part because do the tzatziki and pita bread! Been here twice and the staff is great. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Christmas Eve since every place we originally planned on eating closed shortly after lunch. My boyfriend and I were pleased we stumbled upon this Greek Bistro since we acquired a taste for Greek back in Reno. We were quite sad we'd be leaving the family owned place since we ate there often, but were hopeful when we enjoyed the dishes here. This will definitely be our go to when we get a craving. We tried the falafel appetizer, delicious, and the
keftedakia kabob, also delicious! The service was also a pleasant experience. Can't wait to go back and try their Gyro."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Greek food and this is by far the best I've had in town. Gyro is amazing, both the chicken and the beef! But the absolute winner is their Pasticcio. I have to say it is one of the only dishes in town that I will drive thirty minutes for (about how long it takes for me to get from my apt to the restaurant). The noodles are long and thin, it is well seasoned and there is just enough sauce and ground beef inside; and the top is browned, ahhh I'm salivating just thinking about it. Pasticcio is sometimes called a Greek Lasagna, but I have never had Lasagna this good!! My dad lives around the corner and he was the first person to introduce me to Greek Bistro. My dad is a fantastic chef so my idea of good food has always been a little higher. Before coming to Greek Bistro I had Pasticcio at the Greek Festival held in town every year and was soooo disappointed because I always loved my dad's Pasticcio growing up. But if his was ten times better than their's, Greek Bistro's is ten times better than his. Sorry Dad!! Thank you Greek Bistro for loving my taste buds!"}
{"text":"Greek food usually isn't my thing, but I started to come here for the past 2 years on and off since one of my offices is next door to them.  The food is authentic, and the service is down right homely.  They make you feel like you're apart of the family.  You'll find all the usual suspects like Gyros, Greek chicken salads, lamb, ect.   The filet meal is always my go to... can't go wrong for $15."}
{"text":"Quaint family run business.  Murals of Greece on the walls.  Large portions.  The woman owner is very sweet and gives great service.  The steak kabobs are delicious and tender.  Good salads, taziki, hummus and spanokopita.  They also serve beer and wine.  Casual and delicious."}
{"text":"The lemon potatoes are like crack! I don't know what they season them with, but they are SO good! I got a gyro plate and it was all very yummy. Great tzatziki sauce! I also got dolmades - delish! Can't complain at all - this place rocks. :) The customer service was wonderful too; the lady made sure I had everything I needed when I picked it up. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love their gyro sandwich....Lots of meat and tasted delish! Authentic Taste! Price is reasonable... Hope they don't check change the meat portion. And of, the lady greeted us as soon as we walked in. There is nothing much nicer being welcome with a smile.  That  such quality in food places sometimes lacks."}
{"text":"A group of us went here on our lunch break. There were quite a number of empty tables. We all got the same stuff: gyro with fries. I also placed a to-go order for another co-worker with our dine-in order. The server asked, \"do you want it immediately?\" Well, yes, that's the whole point of ordering it with everything else.

The food was great. The pita was warm, fresh and soft. The fries were tasty and crunchy. But where's my to-go order?

We had to follow-up many times with 3 different people. \"I didn't think you wanted it now.\" WTH??? No apologies whatsoever. We were very late for our meeting and a co-worker starved to death. Don't go here on your lunch break!"}
{"text":"Great Greek place right by Sunset Station and across the street from the Galleria. This is also not far from my work. I love the service, the decor, the ambiance and the food in this little slice of Greece! From the first moment of walking in, you can tell this is a small, family owned GREEK restaurant. The decor is tastefully done in all blue and white (Greek flag colors), the blue is especially nice and calming.  You can also see pictures of the owner's family and Greece all around. You can take to go or dine in, your choice. Either way, the service is thoughtful, quick and efficient. My co-worker was there fore the first time and never had Greek food before. The servers all spoke English and explained pretty much every single dish very effectively. Very impressive for an ethnic restaurant especially.

I like their vegetarian menu. Veggie Alexander and salads are excellent. I have yet to hear someone complain about their gyros. Nothing is microwaved here, but cooked right in front of your eyes. The ingredients look and taste very fresh. 

This is one little Greek place, unassuming and unboastfull, but serves good, quality food in little time.

One little quip, they discontinued their veggie gyro, which was excellent and my favorite thing on the menu...oh well..this place is still great and highly recommended by me."}
{"text":"We ordered the traditional gyro, one with fries and the other with salad. The portion was large and it was good. Staff was friendly and the place was clean. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food & service are great! Feels like you're having dinner @ the home of greek friends (price is very reasonable too!)"}
{"text":"Awesome family-owned Greek place! The food was delicious. One of my favorite things to eat is hummus and their's was fantastic. I loved the pita chips - nice touch. Came with friends and the employees were all so sweet to us and both of our infants. Greek salad with chicken comes with so much chicken - great portions. We were served quickly and they were great about staying on top of our drinks. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2006 , The food is great. It's under a new management they taken the Greek feel away and replace the furniture with old plywood tables & chairs that carry a smell:(. Which is why I haven't return. Which is unfortunate since it was my favorite place to eat. This is why they got a 3 star."}
{"text":"We had a work lunch catered through Greek Bistro today and it was fantastic, I had eaten here one time previously for lunch take out and remember it was good but I wasn't hurrying back. I'm not a super huge fan of Greek food but this was really tasty! I would recommend it to anyone looking for Greek food in the area.
We had a little bit of everything...Salad, Gyro meat, Chicken, Pita Bread, Lemon Potatoes, Seasoned French Fries, Falafel, and Rice and all the sauces. The meat and chicken was moist and flavorful. Somehow they are able to keep their fries from getting soggy during transport! The Falafel was a bit dry and may have been a bit over cooked, a little dark on the outside. Everyone loved just about every thing, it was a big hit with us!
I will give them another try on my own and hopefully get to use them through work again."}
{"text":"Great gyros and very friendly service! Stopped in this past weekend for lunch with the family. The staff was great with our 2 young boys, got our food to us fast and we were all very happy when we left.

Great quality gyro meat, the fries were yummy and my only small complaint was it was a bit on the warm side for us. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey Family!! I absolutelyyyyy looooove this bistro!! The food is so fresh and clean, the building is always tidy, and the customer service is top notch!! They know my order by heart.  Living in Texas and San Diego for the Navy... This is the best Greek I have ever had. Indulge!!"}
{"text":"So I've had some more greek restaurant experiences, and this place's gyros and tzadziki can't be beat! Not to mention we never have to ask for anything, our service is always perfect."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  We had the traditional gyro with fries. Delicious!!  The meat was so moist and tender and tasty! And it was a lot!  Everything was fresh and plentiful!  And for dessert we had the rice pudding. Delicious!  If you are looking for some Mediterranean food this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a gyro. Always delicious and the fry seasoning is amazing. Super friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Been here a few times food is great and delicious 
Staff is friendly 
Fresh and super flavourful"}
{"text":"the food and service was amazing. one of my new favorite spots! I highly recommend the chicken gyro, it's delicious. the chicken gyro usually comes with fries but I got Greek rice instead. the rice was excellent as well. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place nice experience. The servers are nice and the owners are awesome. Keep up the good work greek bistro. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We came in for the first time today at about 2:30 on a Saturday. The place was empty. By 3:00, almost every table was taken, which seemed strange. My wife and I enjoyed the chicken souvlaki which came with a salad first. The salad was very good. Then came the grilled chicken which looked to be marinated in a sauce similar in color and taste to our salad dressing, with onions and grilled tomatoes, and we opted for the rice pilaf. A small plastic tub came on the side with tzatziki sauce, which was maybe the best I've ever had in my life. The owner came over to pick up my plate and I remarked how great the food was and that the true mark of great Greek food for me is the tzatziki sauce. Her response was, \"We have the best tzatziki sauce in the world!\" I'm coming back to try the lamb and I'm getting extra tzatziki!!!"}
{"text":"After driving past here literally 500 times over the past several years, I finally stopped by. Usually I go to another Greek restaurant a little South of here..

Gotta say, one of the Top 2 or 3 grilled chicken kabob/sandwich/pitas I've ever had. A LOT of meat. Most places when you're half way through the pita sandwich, you realize they shoved all the meat at the open end, to look \"full,\" only to leave you with veggies and sauce in the last half. Not this place. Very full and tasty!

The side salad was a good size and tasted like a typical Greek salad. I hate olives, but if I liked em, I might've been bothered by only getting one in my salad. \"Fresh\" is an overrated word when it comes to describing food, but this place deserves it.

I don't see why others say this isn't as authentic a atmosphere as other Greek restaurants. I don't give a crap who works here, as long as the food is great.. but I know several people that won't eat at certain places unless the people making it are of the same ethnicity as the food. For example, my mom won't eat Mexican food unless it's Mexicans making the food. Sushi Twister north of here even uses this to it's advantage with their slogan: \"Japanese owned and operated.\" My point is everyone from the Mexican lady that made my food to the Asian lady that took my order would not defer me from a \"authentic Greek experience.\" Haha, get over it, and just enjoy the food.

My review will turn into a 5 star with a couple more near perfect visits. Great job, and great food so far!"}
{"text":"This place is the bizomb!!!! Was going to another Greek restaurant in the area, but got there and discovered they closed down. Thanks God because otherwise I wouldn't have found the Greek Bistro.

I've eaten tons if gyros before (if you don't believe me just check out my FB profile for proof of my waistline) and this one stacks up among the best. Super fresh, great tzatziki, great flat bread & lots of moist & juicy lamb. Can you say nomnom?!? I can't because my mouth is full of gyro, yo!!!  

A little on the pricey side at $10.81 for gyro, fries & drink, but def worth it. The gyro is huge & lots of Greek fries (BTW, the fries are awesome too).  Definitely coming back to this place.  He'll, I would scale Mt. Olympus to get back to this place.  I'll be dreaming in Greek tonight - no doubt!"}
{"text":"Delicious family run Greek restaurant; definitely one of the best in Henderson. I am a big fan of their Gyros and I appreciate the ripe tomatoes, house made sauce, and plentiful Gyro meat. My problem is that I like Gyros so much that it is hard for me to try anything else, Lol. Therefore I cannot review the other items on the menu, but their french fries have a unique seasoning blend that is a nice touch.
The server was genuinely friendly and his service was excellent.  The ambiance is nice and I love the wallpaper with views of the Greek Islands. I will be back next time I am in the area and have a Gyro craving!"}
{"text":"Love the gyros here. The lamb is cooked perfectly. Everything is fresh. The fries are uniquely seasoned and I eat too many every time! There's a great pastry dessert with fruit, goes really well with their strong Turkish coffee. Got 2 platters of baklava for a party once and it was a big hit."}
{"text":"Update Time

GB is still a great spot to get your Greek food fix in Henderson.  I've been back for lunch multiple times since the first time I reviewed this place, usually for the chicken gyro and fries.  Today I finally switched it up, trying the avgolemono (egg-lemon) soup after some Yelp friends were talking it up yesterday.  Definitely lemony, this chicken soup with rice was a delightful accompaniment to the chicken salad, another first for me there.  Both are served with soft pieces of pita bread and it made for a delicious meal.  I took half of the salad to go since it's a generous portion and I was already a bit full with the soup.  This family-run business always has great service and I'm never disappointed with a meal there."}
{"text":"UN-BELIEVABLE!!!  It's like fresh out of Mama Greece's kitchen! Service is outstanding; warm & friendly. And the food? I'm not sure there are words in the English language to describe how amazingly delicious this was!!!! Can't wait to come back! :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoy coming here frequently.
The staff are all very friendly and the food is awesome"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I have been going here for two years now.  The Greek soup is super good. Their salads are fresh.  The Gyros are also delicious and not greasy.  The restaurant is smaller in size so at lunch time they are packed but make every effort to get tables busted and people seated as quickly as possible. This is my go to Greek food restaurant."}
{"text":"I adore this place, the food is always fresh and delicious, it's well-spiced, but light as well. I've had their salads, gyro, and souvlaki, all excellent. The meat is juicy and well-marinated. Don't leave without a slice of their galactobureko, which is filo with sweet custard. Usually by the time we leave, we're too full to eat dessert so we take some home for later. It's to die for. The service is also excellent. We've only gone in a handful of times, but the server always remembers us and is very friendly. Don't pass up a chance to try this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Greek restaurants in town. Gyros are on point, lemon potatoes are a signature item, best spanikopita! Clean hole-in-the-wall with a mom and pop vibe and great service."}
{"text":"Was headed to my fav spot The Great Greek just up the street when I came across this spot and decided to give it a try and see how it measured up. I ordered the soup and chicken gyro that came with salad or fries. I opt for the salad. The soup was amazing, the gyro although tasty I wasn't a fan of the tzadziki, I felt the chicken was a little on chewy side. The older woman who works here seemed to be more occupied with other patrons and showing them pictures on her phone which left me sitting waiting for my check with an empty glass of water for a good 15-20 mins. For me personally I will stick to my fav spot. This is not a bad alternative and a bit more $."}
{"text":"So...I almost didn't want to share this review because I don't want this place to become too known. Haha hidden treasures are the best. However, the food is so great the owners deserve more people to know about them. I worked at a Greek restaurant with a much larger menu for a significant amount of time and this place blows them out of the water. 

The chicken is so moist and flavorful, the salad is absolutely delicious with the perfect about of dressing and ingredients. They're not skimpy at all, the load the gyros with meat. The hummus is delicious also, sometimes hummus can be too grainy which can ruin the flavor, definitely not the case here.

Service is quick and efficient. The inside of the restaurant is alright, you can definitely see what they're trying to get across. The atmosphere I'm not completely in love with, but then again they don't have much space to work with. I'll keep going back because it's delicious, healthy, a great deal, and close to work. Give it a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is such an incredible, family owned restaurant!  I am so happy that we finally stopped in for lunch recently.

I was nearby at Costco, filling up my tank, and was starving. I thought Greek food sounded yummy, and I knew this place was close, so we decided to try it.

First of all, it's really cute. I love the décor, with the blue chairs and the mural of Greece on the wall.

We entered the restaurant and were immediately greeted by a nice young guy at the counter. When we said we were eating in, he said we could sit anywhere we'd like, and he brought us menus.

We decided to share hummus to start.  It was really tasty and served with fresh pita bread, as well as pita chips.  I think the chips may have been baked and they were really the highlight - they were SO good!

Then we shared the gyro plate, even though I wasn't sure it would be enough food.  Boy was I wrong! It was more than enough for 2 hungry people and it was so delicious.  The meat was some of the tastiest I have ever had, the tzatziki was fresh and the salad was huge! 

The service was pretty much invisible, which is totally OK. I don't need a lot of attention to enjoy my meal.  It's a family owned place, and everyone was very friendly.

We really enjoyed our meal and are looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Gluten Free? I get the feta fries, the rice bowl with chicken, and their yummy rice pudding. I eat here at least 1-2 a week. Love it."}
{"text":"We've been here dozens of times. This place gets fast full during lunch, as well as dinner. Be prepared to say hello to friendly tourists. Inconspicuously located just east of the Sunset Station Casino Hotel, you will be welcomed by very pleasant Greek Orthodox owners who migrated from Persia to Armenia. Their friendly son serves at Lunch Time. At dinner time, meet the husband and wife owners who show their care for providing excellent service in a \"mom and pop\" environment. We both ordered Gyros Sandwiches. Mary ordered the NO SALT Fries while I brazenly ordered the very tasty salted herb chili fries with tzatsizi yogurt/cucumber sauce (which made me happy but later in the evening raised my blood pressure in the evening).  UNDOUBTEDLY this place reminds us of our go to Gyros stop back in Munich, Germany and is by far the best place for Gyros in Henderson. Compared to the other smoky places, we keep coming back here after our shopping at the nearby Costco, TJ Maxx and other fashion stores around."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem. Best gyro by far in this town."}
{"text":"Not quite a 5-star gyro but it was still pretty good. There could have been a little more meat in the sandwich, but it did include greek fries or a salad with the meal- I got the fries and they were delicious. I would go here over The Great Greek mostly due to the price. The sandwiches were pretty comparable, but for the same price I got fries included here."}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek spot I have ever had hands down and the family that owns it is the nicest ever. Gyros and spanakopita is a must and they're baklava omg!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service!! Another one of my favorites because it is FAMILY owned and operated!! Our server was the son and he was funny, sweet and efficient. I would highly recommend from the vegetarian part of the menu, the vegetable (pastry) Not sure of the exact name. I have never experienced a greater Greek meal."}
{"text":"I was thinking about going to the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace today but I've been there so many times and I wanted to try something new. So I found the Greek Bistro on Yelp and I came battle hungry haven't ate breakfast or lunch yet. So I ordered the chicken gyro and the grilled beef plate along with some fries. The server was nice and friendly and got my ice tea filled every time it was empty. Now down to the food 

Chicken gyro 4/5 the portion was spot on and nice grilled chicken

Greek salad 3/5 it was bland I want more sour and tangy flavor

Grilled Beef plate 4/5 the rice was not bad and the grilled beef was right on

Ice tea 4/5 nice taste and I got my refilled every time

Fries 4/5 nice and crispy and hugh portions 

I don't know how is this place surviving because they're zillions of good eateries around that area and when I went around 2PM there were only 2 people and myself."}
{"text":"Best Gyros in town.. !!!! My friend recommended this place.. I luv this place..easy to park and big dining room to eat in as well. I eat here at least once a week.. Call ahead the order to go and not once have They have not gotten my order wrong.. I am picky..

Used to go to the one on Warm Springs.. Yelled at one too many times from the employees.. And Way too small & the wait for to go takes forever..I luv gyros but not worth the size of this restaurant and the rudeness of the staff.."}
{"text":"The best Greek food around! You can tell that the manager and the other employees incorporate traditional recipes to make their food delicious, unique, and authentic. I loved the chicken gyro. The vegetables and chicken were cooked perfectly, and the fries, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce had outstanding flavor. The service was fast and accurate, the manager was very nice, the employees were attentive, and the restaurant was nicely decorated and clean. Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to come to when I'm in Las Vegas. The staff and owner are friendly, and the food is absolutely wonderful!  I dined there on March 15, 2014 with my two dining companions.  Two of us had souvlaki - he the chicken, me the steak - and both were perfect.  I had a bite of his chicken and it was perfectly marinated and seasoned - ditto with the steak.  Their meat marinade must be a well-kept secret, it is SO good!  Our third diner had the gyros plate, which was equally good.  The salad accompaniment is fresh and perfect to go with the food. The lemon potatoes are a must-have and are fabulous.  All in all, I can find no fault with this lovely little piece of Greece in the middle of a small strip mall.  Incidentally, they are very friendly to their patrons in wheelchairs, of which two arrived while we were there. Hospitality and excellent food abound. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful family run greek restaurant. It's a little hard to find but you will be glad you did! They have the best gyros and baklava I have ever had, including from Greece. 

The gyros are on super soft pita bread with plenty of taziki  sauce and even an extra side for those of us who love taziki. The meat is delicious, very tender and topped with diced tomato and cucumber. They also have a gyro salad it you are watching your carbs :). It comes with either a greek salad or fries. The fries are seasoned and make a perfect match. 

Don't leave without trying the baklava. It is so flaky and full of nuts and honey, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Hand down BEST GREEK FOOD IN TOWN!! I love this place every time I go in there they are so friendly very authentic place love love love"}
{"text":"So the first good Greek food experience I had in Vegas was actually at The Fat Greek off of Decatur. This place BEATS that hands down!!! 

It's a small hole in the wall, mom & pop type of place. It has really basic decor (yet a flat screen TV), but plenty of seating and exceptional food. I mean, wouldn't you rather go to a place that isn't visually extraordinary, but has amazing food?

The service was great. They were very nice and accommodating. There were only two servers, one of which I believe was the owner (the 'mom' part of mom & pop), but kept up with the demand of 6 or 7 tables of people.

My mom and I ordered an appetizer of lebneh, which I am SO happy they had, and dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). The lebneh is a kind of strained yogurt, just slightly thinner in consistency than cream cheese and is reminiscent of sour cream. It came out with warm, fresh pita, which is some of the best I've had. It was nice and soft with a wonderful flavor you would expect from fresh bread.

For the main course we both ordered gyros. I mean, you have to order gyros your first time at any Greek place right? She ordered the traditional lamb/beef gyro with a side Greek salad and I ordered a chicken gyro, since I don't eat red meat, with fries. My mom's not very good at description, but told me that her gyro was one of the best she's had...and that's saying a lot seeing as she's been around for awhile - haha. The salad was a basic Greek, but had tons of flavor and the Greek dressing was tasty.

The chicken gyro was DELICIOUS! The chicken was sliced very thin, like you would expect from a traditional gyro, which I appreciated. (When I've ordered a chicken gyro elsewhere they tend to serve it kebob style, which doesn't make for easy eating.) It was very tender and juicy with good seasoning. It was served on that warm, fresh pita with lettuce, tomato, thinly sliced red onion, and gyro sauce. The only bad thing I can say is that they put  A LOT of onion on the gyro...so watch out who you engage in close face to face conversation with later in the day. Mine was served with a side of french fries with a Greek seasoning sprinkled on top...they were SO good. They were nice and hot with the crunchy outside and very soft middle. I couldn't stop eating them, despite my fullness. My mouth kept telling me \"one more\" while my stomach was telling me \"please make it stop.\" Yet, I couldn't stop...especially when those hot tasty fries were dipped in tzatziki. Speaking of, their tzatziki was really good too. It had good flavor and was a nice consistency. It's hard to make a tzatziki that isn't bland and watery, but they accomplished it well.

The pricing is fair too, especially for the amount of food you get. I think we spent a grand total of 30 something dollars for two appetizers and two entrees.

The only thing I really wish they had was an appetizer sampler. They had so many good appetizers (hummus, labneh, dolmas, etc) and I wanted to try them all...but alas...I couldn't. A sampler would be perfect for anybody wanting to try a little bit of everything, but still have enough room to order an entree!! (hint, hint)

I absolutely love this place, and despite the fact that it's hella far from my house, I will definitely frequent here again...and again."}
{"text":"I am from NYC but as soon as I tasted the homemade grape leaves decided I want to move here!!

Everything is delicious and fresh. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Pita is fresh, hummus is
honemade, family owned.  People who take pride in what they serve.  If you are looking for atmosphere this place is prett austere, if it is about the food, this is the place!"}
