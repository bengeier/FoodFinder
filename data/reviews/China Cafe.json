{"text":"Excellent food and very fast delivery. I ordered the fried dumplings, lo mein and general tso chicken mild and was definitely pleased!"}
{"text":"A few months ago I ordered delivery. The driver had gotten a flat and couldn't complete the delivery. The lady called me super apologetic and said if I could come in and pick it up she would not charge me. So I drove up and picked up my order. I tried to pay for the meal but she refused to let me pay. These people are so nice. Today I went to pick up lunch, I had paid with a credit card and added a $3.00 tip. I decided to grab a couple drinks from the cooler and pay cash. The lady at the counter insisted I not pay for the soda because I had left a tip. Then I get home and there were two free egg rolls in my bag. If you are on the West side, there is no reason to order from any other Chinese restaurant. The food is god, the people are the best and the place is super clean."}
{"text":"The food is average Chinese food...neither here nor there. What threw this to a below average rating was the following...I asked if I could substitute my egg roll for 1 crab Rangoon.  She said no. I asked if there was a reason. She said, \"Because they don't want to.\" I was like a deer in headlights wondering if I'd just heard that correctly. It was confusing because she says it in the nicest tone with a big smile. Almost made it worse? There is enough competitors in the area willing to accommodate a simple request. I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for quick pickup. They know their stuff.  We always love getting the Singapore Mei Fun. Try it next time you are in--it's fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant very good food and the vegetables are fresh and customer service is very good and also the people who work there are respectful and nice :) I love eating there"}
{"text":"Decided to order from #eat24 and the process was good on there part but this might be the worse chinese restaurant. The rice was hard and fast like it was microwaved and the crab ragon was not fried hard enough and the red sauce used for the crab Rangoon was solid like jello."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Chinese & the best food I've had in Gastonia so far. Will be back again."}
{"text":"We ordered from First China a lot. We got the worst food possible and called then to let them know. We were told to bring the food back in and they would make up a new order for both of us.  We called and spoke to the manager. She told us that we should bring in what was left and she would make up new orders for us. My husband brought the food back and she changed her tune and brought out an order of vegetables  instead of redoing the order. I called and she refused to get on the phone. They lost good customers.  I would never set foot in this pace again. We order a few times a week from them.  GONE DONE. LEARN HOW TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"Called for takeout. Delivery was fast and food hot. There was a bit of a language barrier but we eventually got the order right.   Shrimp egg rolls were Crispy and tasty.  Main courses were very good too. Three of us ate for about $20.  Will order from them again."}
{"text":"A lot of food with little taste. We ordered because it delivered to Great Wolf Lodge. Won't make that mistake, again. The Mongolian beef was like beef and some sort of weird gravy. Crab ragoon was stale. The one positive is that they were fast."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. It tastes fresh and everything is always on point. Im always wary when i order from an unfamiliar place, but I've ordered food from here half a dozen times and it never disappoints. The prices are very reasonable, the portions are large, and again, the food tastes like whoever made it cared about what they're doing. This place is our go- to for chinese food. They also deliver which is nice."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian restaurant in Matthews and perhaps Charlotte. Family owned, everything is always extremely fresh and very authentic. Service is excellent. I am extremely pickey about Chinese food and this place can't be beat. Big portions. Be prepared to wait for takeout out, they are normally pretty busy."}
{"text":"Ordered to take out, the Seafood combination dish was spectacular, everything very fresh, well seasoned. Ordered some fried rice and it was a little too greasy but over all good. Was not expecting to find Chinese food this good on this area. A minus is the bathroom, I entered to use it while waiting for my order and they could use some Pinesol or Mr. Clean, the smell of urine was a little overwhelming."}
{"text":"Tried China Cafe for the first time tonight, my husband and I just moved to the area. We stopped in and ordered food to go: 2 general tso's chicken, 2 veg lo mein, and 1 order of crab rangoons. Our order was done in about 10 minutes, super fast! The place was very clean and the workers were friendly. I like that you can see the whole kitchen where they are making your food. Everything was very good! I would definitely order from there again!"}
{"text":"Two hours after placing an order for delivery and many phone calls, I am still waiting for my food. I cannot recommend this place for delivery unless you have some serious time and patience."}
{"text":"Been eating carry out from here since day it opened. Never ever had any problems.  Excellent food and service.  Best in Gastonia."}
{"text":"JJ and his wife, the owners, were exceptionally courteous. I really appreciate his dedication to guest satisfaction. The food was delicious and I have eaten \"Chinese\" food M-F for 2 years. I will definitely order here again.   NOBODY SHOULD ORDER FROM PANDA WOK ON 117. Just know that this is way better and the food wont leave you with regrets.   Enjoy your day."}
{"text":"First time there and last.  By far the worst Chinese food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is AWESOME! I love the sweet and sour shrimp and the veggie egg rolls. I don't know why their egg rolls are so good but I think about them on a daily basis. The service is quick and super friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Owners were disinterested in their business as the Cashier was cooking my food.  Fried Rice was extremely bland, wet.  Egg Roll was mushy and tasted as if I got it from my grocer's frozen section.  Feel bad for those that grew up in this area experiencing this as their take out Chinese food.  Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Always great food and very friendly staff.  Great little neighborhood take out place.  They do have a few tables if you choose to eat in."}
{"text":"Wings were good, shrimp fried rice was surprisingly good also!   The delivery man was the first one to ever actually come to my hotel door when I put a request to do so on the order, so i applaud that!  Overall, good value for a needed Chinese fix after work when you don't feel like driving anywhere."}
{"text":"Been back a couple more times. Still provided with prompt and courteous service by the owners, the kids not so much.  Still think the chicken could be better. The shrimp and broccoli is a good alternative, could use a few more shrimp though.   General Tso could be a lot better. While the sauce is awesome and has a good balance of the sweet and spicy, it is far from crispy as General Tso usually is. I attribute this to being served in a plastic with no ventilation. It just makes the saucy chicken soften up an cook in all the heat compacted in. Usually it's crispier when served in styrofoam containers. I don't live more than 5 minutes away and have always showed up while my orders will still being made...just not sure while the general Tso chicken is more soggier.  Whatever, I like china cafe for the most part, despite it just being typical Amercanized fare."}
{"text":"Because of the location (and receiving a coupon in the mail), I decided to give China Cafe a try. I ordered their Crispy Scallion Chicken while my partner ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp. Mine was good, but the shrimp was terrible. That dish should've been labeled as \"Curry Shrimp\"  since it had such a strong curry flavor to it. A couple weeks after my initial visit I was craving some Chinese food and had another coupon for China Cafe. I ordered the Crispy Scallion Chicken once again and brought it home. When I opened the lid and began to mix the rice with the chicken, I noticed a dark ball (the size of a BB). As I looked closer, it turned out to be a small beetle. I immediately drove back and showed the man at the counter. He quickly stated it was a bean sprout, but a lady who came from the back up to the front said something to him in Chinese, and he informed me that he'd make up another order for me. I told him I'd prefer to just receive a credit back to my card. He didn't seem happy about this but processed it and handed me a receipt. Sadly, the convenient location of China Cafe does not outweigh the fact that there was a saut√©ed beetle in my rice. *sad face*"}
{"text":"Never eat here! Terrible food prep habits and rude management! My coworker had to call the health department on them!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The soft shell crabs were really greasy and tasted more like liver, no crab taste at all. The pu pu platter that I had was decent, but won't have any of that again. The service was good and speedy for delivery but it's gonna be awhile."}
{"text":"We order carry out a lot.  Egg rolls are delicious, chicken and broccoli is good as well...ordered extra spicy and got exactly that!  Also we've had the hot and sour soup which was a little on the sour side but still good and the wonton soup which my wife enjoyed.  Service both over the phone and in person is delightful and you feel they are happy your doing business with them.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The fried dumplings were so delicious and the portion of the chicken teriyaki could feed a family of four,  and so fresh and tasty!. Lots of scallions, but I love onions. The lady on the phone was pleasant and very helpful, and the delivery to Lakewood was fast. !!!china cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. I ordered delivery to the pool, was told by the delivery man that they included forks and spoons, which was a lie.  Then I called and told them that this happened and the girl was super rude and told me that she \"doubted that the guy would want to come back to give me that\" .. I couldn't believe it. You'd think the food would make up for it, but absolutely not. Below average it tasted Like it was cooked days ago and had globs of fat in it. Please don't give them service this was a huge regret I was very upset and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"this was my first time ordering here and honestly will be my last . it took 2 hours for my dinner to even arrive . food is cold , not to mention the contents leaked all over the bag . on top of it all the driver came to my door smoking and tried to double charge me . i will never order from here again . if i could give a negtive 5 for my rating that's what it would be . would not suggest to anyone ."}
{"text":"On Wednesday March 8th, I ordered food at 8:40pm. At 9:45pm I called to check in and was told the driver will be here in 10 minutes by the woman who answered the phone. At 10:20 the delivery driver arrived. I expressed to him and his boss, who he called, that I'm a frequent customer and I refuse to pay for the order. Any reasonable business would provide the order for free to keep a customer but the gentleman on the phone only offered a $5 discount on a $20 order. I will not order from this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but they forgot the sweet and sour sauce for my chicken and let's be serious what's sweet and sour chicken without the sauce...."}
{"text":"Was disappointed they didn't deliver to the hotel which was 4.6 miles away.  I had the sweet and sour chicken which was mostly hard, dried up chicken. The vegetable fried rice was delicious and the veggie egg rolls were good. My granddaughter had the beef broccoli and pork egg roll. She said it was \"ok\".  The portions were big and were hot when I got back to the hotel."}
{"text":"I love China Caf√©. Delivery Person she was great always has a smile."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you want quality food, the meat was disgusting and found hair in my food. Bad service from delivery guy as well."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in my opinion. It was strange at first they have a yellow fried rice! At first I was a bit upset, but I tried it and it's really good. Typical fast food Chinese set up, everything great. Just what I wanted , great chines and cheap. This place is a gem, definitely recommend. College student budget approved! Service is great in the restaurant or delivery always on time!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, fairly priced. Nothing to go out of your way for, but I'll probably be back again since I live nearby"}
{"text":"I ordered my food a little after 9 pm. It's now been 2 hours and nothing comes. The business hour is until 10 pm so there's no way that the restaurant can't see my order. If they completely ignored or forgot my order, that will be a whole another story, because they took my money. I'm extremely mad right now, and I'll see what happens next. If they come before 12, I'll try my best to forgive them, otherwise I'm gonna run to this restaurant tomorrow morning and ask for a free meal! FOR SURE!!!"}
{"text":"China Cafe used to be my go to for delivery, but I just can't any more. The food is ok and they're pretty quick with the delivery. My issue is with the delivery driver.  I always order through an app and tip at least 20%, one day I had cash on hand and selected the cash option for my tip. First of all the driver knocked on my door like the police non stop until I opened it (as he always did which was annoying), then he handed me my food then thrust the receipt at me almost yelling \"Tip, tip!\" He didn't even give me time to give him the cash I had on hand. And that wasn't the only time that's happened, the last time I just forgot to select a tip option for my card on the app and planned on just adding a tip to the receipt. The same thing happened, the guy demanded a tip. I'm very easy going and it takes a lot to annoy me but that really did it for me. That was the last time I ordered from them. It's always the older guy that delivers that I had issue with."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the university area of charlotte and have been searching for good Chinese food. We finally found it today tucked back in a small strip mall next to our favorite pizza place. There is plenty of parking, the atmosphere is very relaxed, and the staff were all very friendly and easy to understand. The sesame chicken was excellent, the egg rolls were crisp and not too greasy, the rice was fluffy, flavorful, and there was a generous portion size. The dumplings were amazing and not at all soggy, and the bbq spare ribs were a huge hit. We will definitely be returning often."}
{"text":"Good food , great delivery service! I will definitely order from here again. Reliable fast and accurate delivery ! Even front cashier is most friendly people I have not seen in the chinese restraunt near by."}
{"text":"This is definitely New York Chinese food! The smell, the flavor...finally some next level yumminess! LOL! I broke my diet just because I couldn't resist. As far as I am from home, I found a place that transported me back...at least partially. No complaints, only compliments!"}
{"text":"Real New York style Chinese Food. There Egg Rolls are awesome. Real fast service. Extremely tasty food."}
{"text":"This place real pride in their food.   Very fresh and even the duck source is made on site.  I can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but it's absolutely amazing.  It's pretty much like every other Americanized Chinese restaurant that offers the same thing, but if you've ever had the chicken wings... you'll be amazing.  It is my recommendation every single time! Also, the spare ribs are pretty awesome, too!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. My food arrived late and cold to a delivery man who thought that it being cold was funny. I called the restaurant SIX TIMES in order to rectify the situation and I was HUNG UP ON!!! WTF!!?? I am calling the Department of Health and requesting an inspection on this disgusting excuse for an embarrassment of a delivery service/restaurant. DO NOT EAT HERE; HORRIBLE SERVICE AND A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I'm traveling and have no way to reheat my food. Thanks a lot, assholes. Totally pissed!!! & still no response from GrubHub."}
{"text":"The rice in the pork fried rice was crunchy. The noodles in the chicken lo mein were cold and mushy. Both of us had upset stomach's. In the bathroom frequently for a day and a half"}
{"text":"Deliver was fast and they called to verify my special request. Spareribs fried rice and Chinese donuts. All very good and great price value."}
{"text":"The quality of the Chinese food is okay but all the time they always bring it over with holes burned and melted to the Styrofoam from the hot food. other times they are really late and I had one woman on the phone yell at me because I complained about their food being over 30 minutes late. their minimum order amount is $15 for delivery.  sometimes the drivers mess up because they are fluent in English. One was so late once that I had to literally send him home with his food and no tip. I told him to keep it after he had knocked on my door after being 30 minutes late and tried to ask for my food back which I threw on the ground. if there was another Chinese delivery place I would order from them instead. The woman on the phone is extremely rude and told me \"next time you wait one hour\" then hung up."}
{"text":"Average Chinese takeout please temper those five star reviews... The food is typical mediocre to good and there is absolutely nothing special on the menu"}
{"text":"If I could choose 0 stars, then I would. I ordered delivery and it came pretty quick. Upon receiving my food, I start eating and notice it is cold but I can deal because I had not eaten since lunchtime. There was a hair in my fried rice. The crab wontons that I ordered were cold and soggy. I am missing 2 egg rolls that I paid extra for. Little girl that answered the phone was rude, \"why does this always happen when nobody is here.\" And \"ah shit, I forgot what else he ordered, oh yea missing 2 egg rolls. \" she asked me to call back in 5-10 min when manager is here, then hung up on me.. When the manager called, refused to provide his name, and he answered and said \"what, who dis? Bring food back if you don't like it..\" You want refund, you bring food back. What kind of restaurant talks to their customers like this? Additionally, I gave a generous tip to the delivery guy, however, now I have to waste my time and gas to take this shit they call food back? What's the point in ordering Chinese delivery if you have to go take it back? Never again, China House."}
{"text":"Ordered on grubhub.com. $12 delivery minimum. I received prompt and friendly service. The food came in only half an hour even though the expected time was an hour and on a cold and rainy day too! The taste wasn't very distinctive from other distinctive takeout chinese, but still ok. Like the other reviewers said, they didn't pack utensils so make sure you have some beforehand. Overall, I am satisfied."}
{"text":"I really have to say that of the three items I ordered, only one was even remotely edible. I ordered a large egg drop soup with won tons, followed by steamed dumplings and shrimp fried rice. The soup was so bland it tasted like warm water. The broth was as thin as water, too. The dumpling shell was thin and over cooked and the filling was bland. The only redeeming value was the shrimp fried rice that was pretty flavorful. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is so-so. Portions were modest. The other people were right, the delivery driver is rude about tips. I handed him the cash and without moving from my doorway he demanded to know \"How much?!\" It rubbed me the wrong way so I said \"enough\" and closed the door. I always tip and in the future I will tip another driver. The search for good Chinese food in the University area continues..."}
{"text":"I saw mixed reviews but I decided to try it anyway because I was starving.  I seen the lunch specials went until 4:30 so immediately placed my order online. Online process was very convenient and store called for confirmation.  Delivery was fast and driver was very friendly. Overall pretty good service."}
{"text":"I ordered food and curry chicken was not at all up to the standard.. This place is cheap but not yum"}
{"text":"We travel twenty minutes from our house to this restaurant, at least twice a month . The  food seems so much fresher then most . You can re-heat what you don't eat the next day and it still tastes fresh and not like it was soaked in a ton of grease , like some. The portions are enough for 2 people . We have tried shrimp egg foo young, Singapore mei fun ( thin noodles) little spicy, general tso's  chicken( little spicy) and orange chicken . They all were excellent."}
{"text":"Newcomers to the area. We were looking for a Chinese restaurant that tasted better than the usual mall stops. We came to Yelp and found this place and boy were those reviews correct! It's definitely a small restaurant but it was nice and clean. The young lady working the counter was very friendly and helpful. We placed our order while we were there and just waited in the car so out food was hot when we got it and by the time we drove home to Indian Trail it was still hot by the time we got the kids out the car, hands cleaned, and seated to eat. We ordered beef and broccoli,R egg rolls, and egg drop soup. Everything was delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious:) and fast delivery. Will definitely order from here again! The crab Rangoon was delicious"}
{"text":"Lady was cooking alone and she cooked great. Pretty much fresh food. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Favorite take out chinese spot in Indian Trail.  Some nice take-out deals...spend $25-free 2 liter of soda, spend $40- free 2 liter & generals chicken.  One of few chinese take-out with real deal boneless spare ribs."}
{"text":"Probably the best sesame chicken and fried rice I ever had from a Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great Food, great service, but the lady I talked to on the phone was really rude.  Very short with customers and never said \"your welcome\" or \"thank you for choosing us\".  I don't say this as a point of self-pity or offense taking.  I just hope someone at the restaurant read this review and gets their employees to be more polite to customers.  Otherwise, it is a great business. I love the fact that they bring a credit card machine to you on delivery so you don't have to spell out your credit card number over the phone."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for delivery or quick Chinese.   I was pleasantly surprised when I first ordered from them, the vegetables in my veggie mai fun and in my husband's fried rice were fresh and plentiful! There's always plenty of fresh squash, zucchini, onions, carrots, mushrooms, etc. I don't think they use any frozen veggies; maybe I've only gotten crappy Chinese delivery before, but this is new to me! Their spring rolls are tasty too.   Also, be sure to mention that you have a coupon (you can print one offline if you don't have one from their menus). Oddly enough, they don't seem to have an experiation date or any fine print. I just mention it over the phone and get $3 off an order of $15 or more."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here for the first time at my new house as they're the closest. Ordered online with the Yelp Eat24 interface, very easy to use and it even saves your previous orders!  Crab rangoon appetizer, not the best I've ever had but fried well and had a good sweet & sour sauce served with it.  General Tso's was very good for a take-out joint. The batter was lighter than a lot of other places and I liked it, less breading more chicken! The sauce was great and you can specify your level of spiciness on the ordering menu (I think it just changes the amount of chili peppers they include!).  Got a slice of Carrot Cake for dessert... never again. I could have gotten better carrot cake from a gas station... #sorrynotsorry  Overall a positive experience, there's stuff I know I can order here and some stuff I'll stay away from. Delivery was prompt and the entree was hot and tasty."}
{"text":"If you want quick Chinese Food that doesn't break the bank and tastes great at the same time, head to China Cafe.  I've been coming to this place for the past couple of years since I've been a student at the University.  Their lunch specials can't be beat.  Your order really is done in about 5-7 minutes (maybe they should make that a motto) and the portions are generous.  Usually I stop in and order something to go when I'm on my way home but they also have dine-in service that's usually fast and courteous as well.    They have delivery too if you live near the area but I always prefer to just come in and place my order in person.  If you're craving something quick and affordable and you're in the area, China Cafe is the spot.  I'd recommend it over the other Chinese places in the area unless you're in the mood for a high-end experience like House of Leng."}
{"text":"Our normal routine is to go out for Chinese on Christmas day, a practice that started about 20 years ago when the wife, after our traditional Christmas Eve family get together, threw down her tools and said \"I'm finished! I'm not cooking anything on Christmas\"!  In desperation I investigated and found that most Chinese restaurants are open so we ended up going to our favorite place, House of Hunan in Fairlawn, which we did every year until we relocated to SE Michigan about 14 years ago.  We kept up with this there as well, usually going over the border to Windsor, until we moved back to Ohio in 2014.  Since we now live in Cleveland, we tried Siam Cafe last year, which was very good; however this year, we decided to take the trek back to the House of Hunan.  Unfortunately, my wife wasn't feeling well enough to go out so we decided to get takeout and, since virtually none of the restaurants in \"Asia Town\"  seem to have a website with access to an updated menu, my daughter suggested we try China Cafe based on their menu and the mostly positive reviews on yelp and google.  Well, there's nothing really remarkable here, the food was OK, comparable to our go-to takeout joint in Lakewood, New China King.  Actually, it's probably not quite as good.  The hot & sour soup was OK, my daughter was not impressed with the seafood pan fried noodles (although the tiny lobster tail portion was nice, the noodles didn't seem to be pan fried, just regular boiled noodles).  I ordered two small items, chicken with black bean sauce and hunan beef.  The former was pretty good; however in the latter, although the sauce and accompanying vegetables were good, the beef wasn't very tender. I also requested the hunan to be spicy, but it was quite bland.  Bottom line, since New China King is closer, we're within their delivery area, they typically deliver hot food to us (in SE part of Kamm's) within 20-30 minutes, the food is a little better, the online ordering service (which I really like) is EXACTLY the same for both places, and the prices are comparable, I see no reason to replace New China King as our usual takeout spot."}
{"text":"Order delivery or pickup from here at least once a week. We are totally addicted to their chicken lo-mein, egg rolls, and crab rangoon. Delicious food that is always prepared very quickly, fast friendly service, and excellent food quality for a great price."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Yum. Fresh and tasty. Recommend the moo goo gai pan and fried rice.  We have tried many Chinese food places around here and this is our favorite. We have to drive further to get here but we don't mind. The staff is so friendly and caring.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Crispy scallion chicken is not crispy at all. Rice was well cooked. Vegetable roll was delicious."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for local Chinese that delivered, and China Cafe delivered.  Not only was the food delicious for the price, but it was very fast and the delivery cost was not that bad.  Definitely will be ordering delivery from them in the future."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Fast delivery and great customer service, but my sesame chicken was soggy and my rice was cold :("}
{"text":"I went for the General Tso's chicken lunch special, and it wasn't half bad. In exchange for about $6, I received a good-sized port of chicken and steamed rice, along with a side of hot & sour soup. The chicken and rice were good, but the soup seemed to be extra-salty and the broccoli that came with the chicken just tasted weird and not like broccoli. Still, the main attraction was good and the price was right. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A nice family owned and run restaurant. Food is great and very reasonably priced. I always order over the phone and the food is always ready for pick-up within 10-15 min!"}
{"text":"Great food and impeccably quick delivery to UNCC. The delivery fees are low and the delivery man was extremely friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Chinese hands down!  Never a bad dish and never use MSG. My daughter is vegan and loves the bean curd and tofu dishes. Very hearty, fresh, flavorful.  The family is very nice and prices are great. Some of the best boneless spare ribs' love the sauce and texture! We get steamed veggie dumplings and yet again love the flavor! You can taste a hint of ginger yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this place last night and were very pleased. The General Tso's is delicious and perfectly spicy. The Sweet and Sour Chicken was ok. Ordering in the Yelp app made the experience much better - no language barrier over the phone and it ensured the order would not be messed up. Prompt delivery. I would recommend this place for delivery."}
{"text":"We decided to give China Cafe a visit because of the mail flyer offer Japanese food. There is no close sushi in our area.   The sushi rolls are great! The hibachi however lacks flavor or taste, very disappointed. Just not what I am used to.   There are very few tables to eat in- so I would recommend take out.   I am not sure I will return. Nothing overly negative but nothing that has drawn me to return."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because I have to! I had no problem with my food- it was good. A girl in my office however had found a foreign object in her food and asked for a refund. The driver came back because they had messed up another order and they called the manager. She replied with you touched it, you bought it.  She then came to the office and made a scene because she was told that she would be blasted on social media. She refused to leave, and when she finally did, she made the comment, \"Garbage Black people\" in a professional office.  I will never do business with this establishment again, or recommend them to anyone. I am Totally appalled by the way the manager handled things. (She never did refund the $6.41)"}
{"text":"Cheap lunch. And when I say cheap I mean like $6 cheap that comes loaded. That's how Chinese Restaurants do it. Honestly, I have been an avid goer to China Cafe and it has perplexed me how I haven't taken any pictures or even written a review.   This place is neatly located near the UNCC campus and usually gets all the business from there as well. I usually order the mongolian beef and that comes with an eggroll and rice. I think I would only go here for lunch if I had a choice, and if I felt to eat Chinese. The staff is really friendly and helpful when it comes to ordering, eating in or dining out. There is limited seating as this restaurant is pretty small. If you're in a rush I would suggest to call in and ordering and picking it up. I can't be sure if they delivered, but to my knowledge is that they don't because I've always seen people come and pick food up rather someone running out.   Overall, I would suggest to come eat here if you're looking for a cheap lunch and very filling one. It might be unhealthy, but damn is it good (mostly everything is like that.)"}
{"text":"I lived in the University area during my 2 years in grad school and this was my go-to for quick, easy, delicious Chinese food. I always ordered the Sweet & Sour or General Tso's chicken and occasionally would treat myself to some Crab Rangoon. Always tasted great and was ready in 5-7 minutes (which was perfect for call-in, since I lived about 5 minutes away).  I usually picked up on my way to or from campus, but there there also are a number of places to sit inside for table service. Again, don't expect anything fancy with the decor on the inside but the quality (and quantity) of the food more than makes up for it!  As long as you aren't expecting a super trendy, super gourmet Chinese food experience, you won't be disappointed. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"It was good and large portions. Saving some for tomorrow lol. I ordered lo menu chicken. Sweet and sour soup  also there egg roll and spring rolls with shrimp is yummmy.  I woul average Chinese spot good delivery time too under hour. Driver very nice."}
{"text":"Thought I'd get it together with the Living Social meal deal and decided to go to China Cafe in University after running errands. $5 you get a $10 meal.  So I ordered before I left home with a \"healthy\" meal in mind since having flu like symptoms and upper congestion. I ordered a combination of chicken, shrimp and scallops with fried rice and NO MSG.  I also had it steamed.    First, the seafood was good steamed. Large tailed shrimp and sliced thin quarter sized scallops.  Chicken did not have a taste nor tasted like chicken.  More like 50% filler in that chicken(?).  I did not a good experience with the chicken.   The Vegetables were good and tasted like peas, carrots, broccoli, etc.  I had more vegetable than protein.  Oh, the fried rice was very good and the red sauce helped with additional flavoring.   Althought I gave it a 3 star, it could have been the steamed chicken that sayed, eh, OK?!"}
{"text":"The food is decent (typical chinese takeout food), but the service and staff are horrible! I ordered delivery from here once when I was on campus studying. It took them about an hour to get it to me at UNCC (half a mile away). After dropping off the food, I realized they never gave me a fork or anything to eat with. I called them and asked if the driver could swing back by with a fork, and the lady informed me that they only give forks when they deliver to businesses and hotels (because plastic forks are SOO expensive!). I asked if they could bring one out anyways (again, I'm half a mile away,) and she asked if I could go to another restaurant nearby to get one. I was studying for a final exam ON CAMPUS and couldn't leave, which is why I ordered DELIVERY, and she asks if I could leave to get a fork somewhere else... No, but I can go somewhere else and get food from now on."}
{"text":"Lunch specials rock here! For around $6 you can get an entree with meat, rice, veggies, and an egg roll. I like to get the chicken lo mien special served spicy over white rice. The amount of food they give you is about enough for 2 meals. It usually serves as my lunch and dinner for the day! They're usually pretty quick with preparing your meals and always friendly. Great place for a college kid on a budget!"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi and dumplings, took over 2 hours and 15 minutes to get our food delivered. I would say the food was mediocre except it made me get sick soon after"}
{"text":"Was not expecting much from this small joint on the side of a shopping center, but I am happy I gave it a try.  The workers were very friendly which was nice even though we were getting takeout.  My wife and I got the general tsos chicken, lo mein, and egg rolls.  The egg rolls were your standard egg rolls, hard to mess those up.  The lo mein was very good.  It was not too greasy and not too dry, perfect amount.  The general tsos chicken was some of the best I've had from a takeout Chinese place.  I hate when places make it so saucy that it soggy by the time you get home.  This place made it perfect and the chicken still had crisp to it by the time I ate it.  The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet with a little kick.  As far as takeout Chinese places go, this is one of my favorites and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Your re turn policy .....This place is garbage.....They said they called and said no chicken ...I said beef is fine. It wasn't even fit to eat."}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis. The staff is always friendly and the food is good. I do recommend calling in your order so you don't have a long wait. It takes them about 10-15 minutes to prepare it. They have some of the best crab rangoons around. The prices are very reasonable especially lunch."}
{"text":"We visited a 2nd time and the food tasted different from our first visit. Very salty. Even the sauce on orange chicken was off. We dined in but we left quite disappointed. It was a busy night for them. But that should never change how food is prepared."}
{"text":"Upon second and third check in, our experience was no where as good as the first.  Yes,  both were during the last hour of closing.  Both times, they screwed up the fried rice and egg foo young order with someone else's.  And, the owner told me that I had to leave before closing because they work full time.  The second check in, they made plain fried rice instead of lobster fried rice.  The 3rd check in there was yelling in the background when I placed my order.  They said 15 minute wait time.  I gave them 20 minutes and when I came in to pick up the order, the dining room was empty and one guy had been waiting for 25 minutes to pick up a carry out order; that he told me they'd messed up and were in process or remaking.  They had no other customers so I'm not sure what was going on, but regardless, I won't go back and I know the guy waiting for his remde order won't either.  Too bad as I was looking forward to having another local establishment as a once/week go to.   Tried the beef kung pao combo on the last visit.  The beef was terrible,very dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"Delicious hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant with great staff. This is the typical americanized no-frill Chinese food that always hits the spot. So glad this opened up near by.   I've enjoyed their beef mei fun (a personal fav that many Chinese restaurants don't offer) and was literally  scraping at the little tiny noodles left in my to go box when it was finished. It was delicious. Also had their Szechuan chicken which could have been spicier but still was worth it. The Mongolian beef similarly wasn't very spicy but offered a good amount of vegetables so I didn't feel completely unhealthy after the meal  Most of these dishes were about $8 for really good portions. They also offer lunch buffets at $6.50. Overall I'm happy especially with customer service. I'll be coming here often"}
{"text":"New to the area and found this place on Yelp. As former New Yorkers (and Californians) we are very particular about our Chinese food. We have ordered from here twice, once we picked up take out and once using the eat 24 app. Both were positive experiences. I did however call and get status of our delivery due to the fact that previous orders on Eat 24 have fallen through the cracks. Person who answered was courteous and professional. Food arrived in a timely manner and was hot. We ordered the house special fried rice, house special lo mein, and sweet and sour chicken. Highly recommend all three. Will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"So after wanting to try a new place for Chinese, I saw this place with pretty good reviews and decided to give it a shot. After giving it a shot, and coming back to leave my review, I notice that the most recent review is from two years ago.   Things must have REALLY changed in two years. This place was terrible.  I walk in, and and my food wasn't ready yet, so I pay and wait. While waiting, I wish I wouldn't had paid yet. I saw the lady from the counter MICROWAVE my boneless spare ribs. At that moment, I just wanted to walk out.   Sure enough, the food was soggy, and tasteless. Even the house fried rice was bland and flavorless.  DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND! Go to China Restaurant or Peking Garden in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in a few weeks after the grand opening for dinner. The inside is very clean and there are several tables to sit down to eat.   I ordered General tso's and my wife got orange chicken. (Both combo platters with fried rice and eggroll.)  The portions were huge, I couldn't even finish mine (my wife didn't either) and everything was great!  Vegetables were very fresh and the chicken was cooked perfect. The eggrolls  were very full and crispy.   The only thing is I wish my General tsos was a little bit more spicy, but I know to ask for that next time!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We ordered Fried rice, chicken wings and Sweet and sour Shrimp. Fried rice are okay, chicken was okay. Sweet and sour Shrimp are 70% breading and Half a Shrimp inside,not worth ordering. Other than that, service are fast and tiramisu is always Awesome. ^_^"}
{"text":"as good as you can expect for strip mall cuisine . 5 dollar lunches and will cook to order. They dont have sticky rice thou , so owners if you read this get sticky rice please. Great Iced Tea !"}
{"text":"When I opened the door for my delivery I was shocked to see my food on the ground. The driver attempted to explain it away by saying its in 2 bags and he needed his hands free but wtf. Then when I reach to sign the receipt he snatches it away and starts lecture me about the cost of bringing my food and how I need to tip more. NEVER AGAIN WITH THIS PLACE.   Update: When I tried to call to make a complaint the girl answered and said please hold and audibly put the phone down. No greeting, no response from me, or anything. I just hung up. All the bad reviews are true. I will literally never order from here again."}
{"text":"Food is OK... Definitely not excellent. I have had better Chinese food before. The customer service is  horrible. I specially told them I was Vegetarian and I did not want even egg in my meal. They made a mistake and when I called up they were very rude and started arguing instead of fixing it. I guess this will be my last time from here"}
{"text":"So we tried China Cafe yesterday, we live very close so we called our order in. My first impression was that the restaurant was very clean! The employees were friendly and our food was ready  as soon as we arrived.   We ordered two combo platters(general tso's chicken and honey chicken). portion size was generous we could not finish our platters. The chicken could have been more crispier but still very good. The fried rice was of great quality no need for extra seasoning or sauces. Lastly eggroll was a little thick and doughy for us and left us wishing for more filling.   Overall a great experience and we recommend that people try this place it might replace your favorite."}
{"text":"went here 4 times,the food was fine and the 5th time was our last,shrimp roll were horrible,general tso chicken should be spicy not sweet,the won ton soup was greasy i am saddened i thought i found a good chinese resturant now ill go too saga where they know how to make general tso chicken Save your Money"}
{"text":"The food and pricing is decent, could be better. The delivery service is a bit slow but overall it's an average chinese spot."}
{"text":"The Singapore rice noodles are so good!  My boys love this place!  Always great service with special requests and fast delivery!"}
{"text":"Only went there because it seems to be the only Chinese place in the area open as late as 11 on the weekend. Other than that and good price, nothing else is great about this place. The food is decent, and service is slow. I called in my order and when I arrived the girl had no idea what I was talking about. Apparently they forgot to give my order to the cooks. So I waited an extra 10-15 minutes and got asked what I ordered 3 times by different people. Very annoying."}
{"text":"I called for delivery and the guy picks up and ask for the number of the hotel I'm in. I told him I don't have it but I can get it and call back.  He then tells me I need to \"hurry up\" because they are about to close. I then ask if he just told me to hurry up because I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt but he said yes because we are about to close.  I told him never mind I'll just order from another place and then he hung up."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken lo mein, which was drenched in oil. The pork fried rice was dry and flavorless.  The only good thing about my meal was the big portion of hot oil. The spring roll was nasty and bland. I gave em two stars instead of one cuz the fast delivery. And yes, i wont be back there again.  Sorry!!!"}
{"text":"NEVER NEVER NEVER EAT HERE, very Crappy food. Better off going to the food store and buying premade Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it short and sweet... The food was very greasy, the egg rolls were fried in old oil, the delivery person rang my doorbell as if he was 5 years old, I answered and he said \"here now give me tip\", there was no sauce that I asked for and the \"shrimp fried rice\" was just yellow fried rice with a few onions. I regret the tip I did give him and I will never choose them again !"}
{"text":"I tried to write a review earlier and it didn't go through. So, just the basics this time. I've ordered here for 10 years or more. Today it took well beyond the estimated delivery time, the food was barely warm, the order was not correct, I called & messaged to only get that it was on its way & that these things happen sometimes (again I've ordered here for over 10 years & not had this happen), and the amount was half of a full order. Employ decent drivers, don't give lunch plates to dinner orders, and get better customer service. I suggest getting Uber to deliver better food or Lyft to take you there to pick it up at a better restaurant yourself."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp lo mein with crab Rangoon and wings. It was really tasty! They left out my dad Cl sauce which I love bit they came back and delivered it! I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Perfectly serviceable takeout Chinese - you can eat there if you like, but probably not the best place for it, as with most such places, but this is certainly on the smaller side, with only a table or two, and little if any atmosphere.  The portions are also reasonable, but vary depending on what you order - if you choose their combinations, as with many places, they are smaller, so if you want a huge helping, don't take that route, and instead choose the dinner portion.  Also have found that the crispy level does not seem to hold when taking things home - though it may actually not even be there when dining in (though we have not done that), so if you want that in your meal, you should consider it."}
{"text":"Pass by the China Cafe when driving down Clifton Blvd. ordered a quart of General Tsao's Chicken, was bland, no taste, overwhelmed with peanuts, and the vegetables were cut for soup, not the oriental cut in traditional Asian Cooking, ordered spring rolls, not too good either, the sauces (hot mustard) were packets no kick to them, fortune cookies were stale too, the redeeming item in the order was the white steamed rice.   If your on Clifton looking for some good Asian food, get on Madison in Lakewood, and head to the Thai Kitchen, a few bucks more, however, everything is cooked to perfection......"}
{"text":"I ordered boneless ribs w/ fried rice and tiramsu. Food came as scheduled and tasted okay. My issue was the older gentleman who as soon as he gave me the rip started repeating 'you don't give me tip'. I've ordered frome here before using seamless where I usually add my tip to the order. I had planned on just adding the tip but the reciept said tip - cash. I have never had a problem tipping for service, eat-in or delivery, but to demand it is unprofessional and honestly annoying."}
{"text":"Always fast and big portions! My favorites are: sweet and sour chicken, lo mein, steamed dumplings, garlic chicken, egg drop soup, sweet and sour soup, egg foo young, cashew chicken and a few more. Best chinese for the price."}
{"text":"Have you ever had leftover Chinese delivery that wasn't even worth saving? I didn't know this was possible until I ordered from this restaurant.  I ordered because they left menus around my apartment complex and I have been looking for decent Chinese food delivery. About an hour after ordering, I called to make sure they had my apartment number right. The girl answered like she was answering her cell phone. I had to clarify if I had called the correct number.  Once the food finally got here, it was just plain bad. The rangoons weren't filled well and were tough, the sesame chicken was poorly breaded, the broccoli and chicken tasted frozen and undercooked at the same time. I took a few bites and had to just throw the rest away."}
{"text":"This is our go to don't feel like cooking choice. Good food, decent variety and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered several times, each time the food was worse than the time before. This weekend was the last straw-food poisoning. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese restaurant! Always amazing. I moved & live too far for delivery, but it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Very quick delivery, however the food wasn't as great as the reviews raved about. General Tso chicken was fatty/skin pieces, and the sauce was very generic tasting. The Tuna Tempora roll had a very fishy taste to it that made it seem not fresh (yeah, I know tuna tastes like fish, but this just tasted off). The cheese wontons were just ok."}
{"text":"Love the service. Love that there is always a welcoming environment. Like that there are always several others coming in for takeout orders. Fresh ingredients and vegetarian options. Small place, but a few tables if you want to stay and eat. They will deliver for orders of $20 or more. Good value."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese restaurant. The store is clean, and the food is prepared fresh. The General Tso's and Szechuan Chicken could've had more heat though; they weren't spicy at all even to my spouse, who generally prefers mild dishes. (Is it me, or is this the common issue in this area?) But their fried rice, on the other hand, was perfect. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Got delivery and it was good timing. Food was decent and portion was a good size. I got lots of left overs. Will order again was very happy with everything."}
{"text":"China Cafe is a great local Chinese restaurant located in Turtle Creek. Traditional Chinese food at a reasonable price. I'd recommend any of the combination meals for a quick lunch or enjoyable take out dinner.  I've had the chicken and broccoli combination a few times, and it is always extremely flavorful. Delivery is free and very fast. I'll continue to order when I'm looking for a traditional Chinese meal."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here off Uber eats and it was horrible!! The food was horrible. It looked like slop for pigs and the name of the restaurant on Uber eats was listed as dragon boat! A totally different name. Uber Eats not the restaurant would refund my money DO NOT EAT HERE. DO NOT ORDER FROM UBER EATS!!"}
{"text":"I got a menu is the mail and decided to give this place a try. This place is off the beaten path. I tried the summer breeze roll and it was pretty good. The pink casing was something I never saw before but it was an all in all good roll.   I ordered the general tso chicken combination plate. The chicken was cool but the rice was very yummy. The chicken was not spicy and that knocked off a few points. This place would have gotten at least four stars but the egg roll was awful. There was no flavor and I could tell it was previously frozen.   Despite the three stars I will come back and try another roll. Perhaps a lunch special next time because for $5.99 I will give general tso another chance."}
{"text":"I don't typically complain, but I'm hangry and very un satisfied.  I ordered sesame chicken by itself, combo lo mein, and wonton soup. The gentlemen was very confused about the lo mein and kept asking me if I wanted combo lo mein... and I said yes. He didn't understand my address, or card number. I had to spell it out 6 times.  Food arrives (quickly actually) and we have sesame chicken on top of a bed of lo mein..... and wonton soup.  I'm hungry and watching my family eat while I munch on an egg roll..."}
{"text":"The food was okay, I really liked the garlic sauce. I also liked the fact that the food was ready on time so I didn't have to wait for pickup"}
{"text":"I ordered from here because I had eaten here when I first moved to Charlotte and because I need something that would deliver. I ordered veggie fried rice. Their rice is yellow as opposed to brown and has no egg,  unfortunately. I also ordered veggie lo mein. Nothing to rave about. The delivery guy was nice. No major issues other than way too many onions in the veggie rice and lo main. And they Are huge."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. The lady greeted us a very assertive \"HI\" while sitting down. She later gets up to take out order. She never smiled to us or any other customers. I'm a vegetarian and she charges me extra for a spring roll to substitute an egg roll. As I'm sitting down at the table she brings the spring roll while I smile, say sorry about that and thank you with my hand out she tossed it on the table. I will was gonna ask for a refund because I am not giving my business to people that treat there guest this way but I let it go. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food!  Definitely coming back.  Dumplings are delicious!  Soups are excellent and not over salted!"}
{"text":"Been back a couple of more times during the week and the wait has been very reasonable each time.  This is my favorite Chinese place around Indian Trail.  Food is always fresh and good."}
{"text":"We live near by so we went in on a Sunday for eat in and was surprised first by how clean the place was and then by how quickly our food was prepared. Personally, my expectations weren't very high because it seemed like your average, cheap food. It was better than that! It was cheap but really good. The wonton soup was seasoned well and both the general tso's and the honey chicken were crispy and delicious. The honey chicken was especially surprising because I've had it at other places and its been too sweet but this was nicely done.  Looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Stopped in for our first time since moving out here. (It's 15 min away). Forgot the sauce for my meal. I asked for both my girlfriend and I to have our meals remade because we had to go back and hers would be cold.  Remade mine and not hers and simply stated we cannot do that for her. PISS off I hope you go out of business!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is friendly. I haven't found a better Chinese restaurant as of yet in the area (Matthews/Charlotte NC)."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese take out spots in Indian Trail. I always get their chicken wings and fried rice."}
{"text":"This is a very good Chinese takeout ... it's just the perfect greasy food that I used to eat in NYC .. I have been looking for a place like this for a while .. their sesame chicken and general Ts chicken is very good..  they have great lunch specials and very affordable! I am actually very happy with this place and I just wish the lady behind the register smiled a little !!!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge! Food overall is great! The service is okay, they're friendly but could be a bit faster."}
{"text":"Good prices, quick delivery! I'm a big fan of cold food so I think it was better the day after I got it since it sat in the fridge my boyfriend got beef & broccoli and it was a VERY small portion, and I got general tso which was okay, but like I said, way better the next day! Nothing stood out in a great or bad way. I would recommend trying them to see for yourselves!"}
{"text":"1st time ordering here, very surprised by the freshness of the food, price point & delivery time. The delivery person was very friendly. Great way to enjoy Friday Night at home."}
{"text":"Good for a cheap neighborhood Chinese restaurant... Large portions; always quickly delivered and reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Called delivery and it took about an hour to come. No chopsticks or forks are with it. Food is not very Chinese style, but better than Panda Express, but so so."}
{"text":"Good food, great delivery service! I will definitely order from here again:) reliable fast and accurate delivery!!"}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food place right off of 485 and Idlewild Rd exit in Idlewild Market Shopping Center.  In my opinion, this place is set up more for take-out than a dine in experience.  You can definitely do both, but there are only 3-4 booths and some tables you can push together for larger parties, but the way the kitchen is configured (open) it can get rather warm in there in a jiffy.  The staff is always friendly and patient when I come in.  I always find it amusing that the English spoken has a southern accent (just a bit) and then it can instantaneously switch over to their native tongue to yell orders to the back of the kitchen.  Per usual americanized-chinese food places, the serving sizes are gi-normous so you will be eating it for a while (definitely great shared family style too).  There are a couple of refrigerated coolers up front for sodas... I think if you order enough, you get a free 2-liter... but at that point you probably will have a feast going on for a couple days with that amount of food."}
{"text":"Having recently moved in with a friend that lives in this area, this was recommended as the local chinese takeout place. The food is ready quick and cheap. So far I have gotten the general tso's chicken, chicken and shrimp with garlic sauce, and wonton soup. Everything has been pretty standard for a chinese takeout joint. The vegetables are fresh and the meat is cooked well - all covered in some delicious sauce. Lunch special is a great deal for about $6. The girl who answers the phone to take orders and works the front counter is friendly."}
{"text":"I have to agree that this is the best place in town for Chinese food.    They're fast, efficient, and their food is outstanding.  The entrees here make the food at other local Chinese restaurants seem like something out of the microwave.    My favorite order so far is the beef and broccoli with crispy noodles.  I've never had better.  In fact, I plan on picking some up today!"}
{"text":"This is great, fast Chinese food. I walked in, ordered, and within 5-7 minutes my food was sitting right in front of me.   I ordered the SaCha chicken and shrimp which was great! Just the right amount of spice. Not to mention the egg roll that comes with it! I love extra little perks like that.   Needless to say, I'll be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Went today for a late lunch with my daughter. She said it was good food. The food was fresh and hot. Presented nicely. I liked that they served chicken fried rice instead of pork fried rice. They were flexible with substitutions. The swapped out the pork egg roll for a spring roll. The portions were large and we ended up taking food home even though we got the combination platter. Typical of Chinese food, I felt like I couldn't walk after eating. I had reflux, which was unusual for me. Then 4 hours later, abdominal pains and frequent visits to the bathroom. Took some pepto bismol and am waiting for that to kick in. All in all, I wish we would have gone somewhere else. I have never gotten sick from eating Chinese food. This is a first. And a last."}
{"text":"Its good for the price i guess.. Got the General Tso Chicken, requested it well done and it was still not even close, she rather ignored my request or it's regularly very soggy. It came with an egg roll so that was pretty cool..And they have a fridge with cold root beer."}
{"text":"Saw that this place was new so I gave it a try. I got the egg drop soup, which was a bit thick and could use more egg. However, I love that they have me crispy noodles with it. For the main, I got shrimp fried rice. The shrimp are good size. The overall taste was ok and could use less oil. Overall it's good."}
