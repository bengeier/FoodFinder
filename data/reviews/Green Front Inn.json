{"text":"Disgusting. Zero stars. Owner is extremely rude. Employee didn't wash hands as he left the bathroom. The place was dirty. And the food was terrible. Rubbery burger tasted like a frozen burger, I guess that explains how they couldn't cook it medium."}
{"text":"Green Front Inn is a South Side staple, I'm pretty sure it's existed about as long as I've been alive and I'm in my 30's.  It's a very odd combination but Green Front is a dive bar mixed with an \"old people\" restaurant. The latter comment is the biggest hint about the overall food quality: most things aren't very flavorful and are usually unsalted, but everything is also incredibly cheap plus they have daily specials.  Green Front shines with their sandwiches. They're known for their fried fish, but they also make surprisingly good Reubens and steak hoagies (my Green Front meal of choice).  The servers are friendly if not a bit confused, ordering can be an inconsistent experience and I usually have to make extra sure that they have my order right before they take it to the kitchen. The staff also do not always talk to each other very nicely but in the same vein you can tell that they've worked together for years.  If you live in South Side, Green Front is worth a try to say that you got to experience the Green Front, but definitely don't go in expecting to be wowed."}
{"text":"Great place too eat dinner at night most of the time there has been a few times I've come in during the lunch time, my food has been cold my opinion dont go at lunch dinner is the best"}
{"text":"Friendly, divey, cheap and delicious.  I paid $22.55 plus tip to feed 3 people. A great deal. Nothing fancy here, but you'll get good service and a good meal. Portion sizes were great and everything tasted fantastic. My grilled chicken breast was flavorful and well-cooked and my brother received 8 buttery, delicious pierogies instead of the promised 5 at no extra charge.  The seafood platter my husband ordered was enormous and filling. Stop in for an affordable delicious meal."}
{"text":"2 stars because let's face it, like half the bars on southside, this place is a total dive.  but a friend of mine jogged a memory of the green front, and I had to share.  back in college (duquesne) I worked around the corner at unique pizza.  and after work, i'd hurry home to change and head over to the green front where predictably I'd find my \"crew\" of college buddies waiting for me.  we were young and loud, and as the average age of patrons here was around 60, we totally took over the bar.  anyways, we built up a good rapport with the owners, and with the bar tenders, and I'll always remember that they knew my drink.  so that when i walked in the door, and hugged all my friends, there would be my double jim beam on the rocks with a splash of soda, waiting for me.  i miss this place.  they always had really good dinner specials.  i remember eating their club sandwiches and loving them.  they also used to do great kelbasa and sourkraut during stealers games.    good times at the green front inn."}
{"text":"Dive bar and greasy spoon like only Pittsburgh can do it. The food and ambiance are exactly what you would expect from such an establishment.  If you expected more and didn't get the gist of this joint walking in, that's your fault."}
{"text":"Went there and the bartender was only person there.  Said the dining room was not open, but he offered to make me a fish dinner if I wanted it.  I was hungry, and figured what the hell, how bad could it be? Now I do not know if this is their regular cook or not, but let me tell you...it was the BEST fish I had for a long time!  Nice and crispy, seasoned well, a nice portion, with delicious cole slaw and a nice portion of fries.  The best part?.....THE PRICE.  With my beer it was ten bucks, and I gladly gave the man a fiver for a tip.  Yeah...it's a dive bar, but sometimes those \"dives\" can put out the most awesome food.  And Green Front Inn delivered just that!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped at the Green Front Inn after driving past countless times. The food was amazing and the waitress was super friendly and attentive. A good variety so you have lots of different selections to choose from. I got the hamburger which was delicious and my bf got  the fish sandwich. It was HUGE! Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu. I would have liked to get dessert but I was stuffed. There's always next time!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat. The place doubles as a bar up at the front and a unique sit down family restaurant towed the back.   As far as the bar goes, the drinks are super cheap, and they have 40s to go at the cheapest price on Carson St. The bartenders are always friendly, and ready to mix up your next favorite drink.  The food like is super good, known for their deep fried fish sandwiches, all of it is home made. I personally love their clubs and Reuben sandwiches. The place always has great food specials, and the family owned staff is always super friendly and ready to serve. The food is also super cheap compared to other bars in the South Side. They could definitely up their prices 20% and still be reasonable.   Only negative thing I would say about this place is it needs updated a little. Lose the old paintings on the wall. Haha"}
{"text":"I was generous with a 2 star rating only because they have 2 good bartenders and its a good place to grab a quick six pack. However, the manager is rude, the food that was once decent is now terrible (I've recieved food with hair in it, and have waited over half an hour for half a dozen wings that made me incredibly sick.) Also the crowd they attract isn't a good one. It's hard to walk in to get a 6pack without someone trying to pick a fight. I try to avoid this place. Also a waitress tried to argue that creamy italian was ranch. No, it's not."}
