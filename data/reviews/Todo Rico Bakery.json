{"text":"Sadly disappointed by this place. The beef empanadas we ordered were filled with more potato then anything else. It's too bad because the crust and hot sauce was yummy. We won't be back. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Love this place 

The best Empanadas in the GTA.
The chicken and beef are great.

{"text":"****Todo Rico Bakery is no longer running****
I was looking forward to trying Todo Rico Bakery for the first time today, until I was sadly informed by Google that they are permanently closed. 
I figured I should notify fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Do you know what Todo means in Spanish? It means Total package, so it follows that Todo Rico Bakery is the total package of Columbian bakeries. Actually, admittedly I have absolutely no knowledge of that Todo Rico means, and I'm fine with that, so long as they keep make thjose glorious empanadas (pronouned Eh-piah-nah-ta) if you're not cool like that and don't know - pshhh *flicks hair*.

Enough sassy talk and let's get to the goods, whoa! I was stopping into Long & McQuades to return some equipment and then my Yelpy senses went off when I realised a long read about and sought after Empanada bakery was located right next door. #WinnerWinnerEmpanadaDinner!

Todo Rico is a small storefront, maybe 450-600sq ft tops, and it's jam packed with various grocery tastes of the Columbian homeland. So if you've visited or hail from this country, Todo Rico has you covered when the homesick bug hits.

I walked in, and ordered 1 each of the Chicken and Beef Empies. Asked for the homemade hot sauce - \"which isn't too hot - We're not Mexican\" advised the shop keeper. (dead). 

I busted out a $20 to pay and she looked at me like I was crazy, these pizza pocket sized freshly baked, golden, crunchy, meat filled, made fresh daily bites of heaven went for a whopping $1.25-$1.75 each!!!! Before I could blubberfy and buy out their entire inventory I snuck away to the non-judgement of my front seat and gorged myself! #Heaven

There Ain't NADA like a Todo Rico Empanada

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Delicious empanadas! Located just west of Mavis Road and Rathburn Road, about 5 minutes from the Mavis Rd. Hwy 403 exit, this place has a very divey, basic, unassuming exterior (and interior) but their empanadas are pretty impressive.

First, the parking. Lots of parking available in this plaza, and on the Thursday afternoon I visited, it was virtually empty.

Second, the food. I ordered 3 chicken empanadas and 1 beef empanada. I'm more accustomed to Filipino empanadas where the exterior is much softer with texture similar to bread. But, Todo Rico's empanadas are way different, and it's a good different - the exterior is super, super crunchy and crispy. Oily, but scrumptious, and came with some delicious hot sauce. The filling is generous, stuffed with meat and potatoes, and if I had to choose - get the beef over the chicken. It's tastier.

The place is small and acts as a restaurant-bakery-takeout spot-mini grocery store (there are some small grocery items behind the cashier). They sell some pastries, empanadas and a couple of other items from a hot table at the front. Selection is pretty small. Note that there are only a couple of tables if you want to eat in. Visually, the place is pretty basic, but the empanadas are what the lines here were made of.  

For 4 empanadas, I paid around $6.00. Note that if you want to pay by debit or credit, there's a minimum spend of $5.00."}
{"text":"Thrilled to write this review as this is one of my fave places to get my Colombian grub on. Its a bakery but you can also get actual hot dishes here as well. So you have that option if you're hungry buy something from their bakery but you're really hungry order a hot plate of food and you are on your way my friend.

Let me start off by saying that their food always tastes so fresh. Tastes like home made cooking, all the time. From their bakery you can get pastries, bread, empanadas, arepas (almost like a warm and thicker tortilla but better, try it with cheese!) and many other goodies. From their hot plates you can get soups to rice with chicken and salad or beef steak with chicharron (fried pork rinds, tastes so good) with rice and plantain or fish and more. 

What won me over was their Arepas with cheese or with sausage. The cheese they use makes you believe they have a cow in their back yard which helps produces their fresh cheese. Of course they don't but that's how good it tastes. If you're thirsty you can get a postobon drink (apple flavoured soda) to help that food go down."}
{"text":"I recommend 100% the chuleta cale√±a, it's a massive plate with a perfectly cooked piece of pork, very crispy in the outside and juicy inside. I also recommend you have a natural passion fruit juice to accompany this crazy amount of food."}
{"text":"3.5*  This is a small-ish bakery right beside Long & McQuade, in the same plaza as Leela's Roti.  There is seating and as opposed to Chinese and some Italian bakeries, all the items are kept in a glass showcase.

I usually love bakeries, but none of the sweet stuff appealed to me, at least visually.  I'm not the hugest fan of meringues or stuff that's made out of puff pastry and looks like Flaky Puffs...only with little-to-no filling.  I ordered the Chicharron de Guayaba and just had a bite of it and it was meh.  Fairly dry and guava filling was concentrated into a small portion of the \"chicharron\".

So personally, I'd skip the sweets and head directly to the savouries!

During my visit, they had 2 kinds of empanadas available:  Chicken and Beef/Potato.  The girl behind the counter served it in a plastic basket lined with a napkin and a spicy sauce came on the side.  The Beef/Potato was much better, Chicken was chunky, but a bit dry.  Slightly oily since both are fried.  Size was good for price ($1.25), about half that of a Jamaican Beef Patty.

Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about, but there aren't any soups or arepas.  I specifically asked about the arepas and the girl showed me these thick tortillas from the freezer.  I said, \"Nothing like sandwich?\"  and she said no.  So perhaps they had them before.

There was some chicharrons and a sausage, but they looked uber dry.  So I'd just go for the empanadas as a snack IF I was in the area.  Girl was friendly and helpful."}
