{"text":"Not everything on the menu is great. I always love the pad Thai because I end up with enough for an extra meal to take home.  The service is fast if you don't come at peak hours and very friendly."}
{"text":"Solid soup! Delicious wontons. I really enjoy the spicier version.  Makes for a good recovery meal after a weekend of fun.  Take out is a quick and preferred option."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Soups are great.  Its a mix of Japanese Thai and Chinese.  not expansive and quick service.  Great for a quick lunch.  I like the general Tao chicken!"}
{"text":"We were recently introduced to this restaurant by friends.  We thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the restaurant has become one of our \"go-to\" places when we are just too tired to cook or just want to treat ourselves.  We always go with the combos - more GOOD food than the two of us could eat at one sitting and we usually ask to wrap and go, the leftovers.  I don't have one favourite dish; I love them all!    The restaurant is clean and airy.  The staff is friendly, polite and professional.  Very easy ambiance making conversation easy.    Pricing is low to moderate.  Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Disappointing tonkinese soup:   3 slices of overcooked beef, sprinkles of green leaves, 3-4 forksful of noodles and a bowlful of broth made out of powdered beef stock.  After eating the noodles, there was still a full bowl of broth left and was still hungry.   The tonkinese soup didn't in the least look and taste the said famous soup.    After reporting my disappointment, I was offered a free of charge tonkinese soup but still it didn't meet my expectations.  There were more noodles but the both was lukewarm.  I think they took back my broth n just added the noodles n a few slices of beef n gave me back.  In the end I did not eat the soup they brought me.  No stars for this place."}
{"text":"First time at the soupebol, food was pretty good. I got the rare beef soup, I found the meat was low quality however. My girlfriend had vegetable with chicken, she thought it was very good and her broth was very tasty. We had the lychee desert. Fruit was not very fresh.  Service was mediocre at best. One guy was knowledgeable, but they didn't check up on us at any point after giving us our main course.  As far as value goes, I've had bigger \"large\" soups for cheaper in the past."}
{"text":"This little gem has the best wonton soup. It is loaded with vegetables and is a meal in itself! Prices are good and they also deliver."}
{"text":"Had the wonton soup was very good. Service is ok only 2 men serving place was pretty full during lunch"}
{"text":"Resto à lunch tout à fait correct si vous avez envie de standards asiatiques comme la soupe-repas Tom Yam ou un pad thaï.  Le problème est qu'à chaque fois que je mange là je me demand pourquoi ça goûte rien. Très édulcoré comme goût. En fait, la Tom Yam du Thaï Express dans n'importe quel food court de centre d'achats est plus goûteuse. Cherchez l'erreur."}
