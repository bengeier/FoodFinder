{"text":"Good Fried Chicken. Lots of choices for sides. Collard greens and beets are good ones."}
{"text":"We had the grilled salmon special and greek salad with chicken it was good .  The service was excellent.  I m hoping they will serve breakfast.  Not many family own restaurants in Huntersville that serve breakfast.    Will be back for the potroast dinner special next time."}
{"text":"I have a feeling that a place like the one Huntersville Family Restaurant aspires to be must be seasoned over many years.  There are local restaurants that have grown into the role, like Lupies down the street and The Cook House and Acropolis in Cornelius.  The food is intended and designed to be plain and predictable.  It seeks to be the essence of a \"home cooked meal,\" and so nothing trendy or exotic should ever appear on the menu.  Ingredients might be fresh, but then again they might be canned or frozen, because they are defiantly not cooked for sophisticated palates.    I had lunch here once, and chose the popcorn shrimp.  The shrimp were piled on top of a bed of french fries, with 4 or 5 large hush puppies off to the side, and in most places would be enough food for 2 or 3 lunches, but hearty portions are of course part of the expectations.  For what it was, my lunch was quite good.  The service was good.  The place is clean, if a little old looking.  It will be interesting to see how it fares."}
{"text":"Good, homemade food! We were seated quickly, the tea was good and the food came out hot and fresh. We had the Deep South burger, fried popcorn shrimp with coleslaw and mac'n'cheese and baked chicken with rice and green beans. The green beans and slaw were just ok but everything else was good. Nice portions and good prices. The decor is a little confusing because it looks like a seafood restaurant from the '80s but I liked it. It could have been a little cleaner but that went along with the decor. Will we go back? Yes!"}
{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant in Huntersville, NC. (Where Captains Gallery and Lighthouse used to be) They have \"Country Style Home Cooking\". My family and I have been here several times now. The appearance is nice and clean. The prices are GREAT!!! You can't seem to find prices like this anymore unless you decide to go to a fast food joint, which I would never recommend. Here are my reviews on the food. Soups: Awesome!! They have different ones all the time. Hush Puppies: Awesome, Fried Chicken: The best in the area including in Charlotte, Alaskan White Pollock: Awesome, Sweet Tea: Better than BoJo's, Ground Sirloin: Good, Fish N Chips: Good (my son LOVED it but a little oily for my taste). One thing I would change is the salad, I really wish they had mixed greens on their salads rather than iceburg. Definitely try it out. You won't be disappointed. Kim, our server, will always be our server when we return. She is on point!"}
{"text":"Big fan after our first trip.  I had a rare (my choice)10oz rib eye, with fried okra and mac & cheese. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. Okra was good and my 2 year old ate all my mac & cheese.   My wife had fried flounder with cucumber salad. Impressive as well.   Hushpuppies... So good.   Inexpensive, quick service, friendly staff, good comfort food."}
{"text":"Loved it! If you remember the old Captain's Galley, these are the same owners and they bought it back. Menu is more expansive and it's all Southern cooking. Honey fried chicken is like eating dessert with your meal. Sirloin tips were great too. Everything is fresh and service is great. Put your diet on hold and enjoy."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE.  THE SERVICE WAS EVEN BETTER.  My wife and I ordered 2 plates of fried chicken with 2 sides each and 2 cokes.  20 bucks.  Are you kidding me. NEWSFLASH TO THE PEOPLE IN HUNTERSVILLE WHO DO NOT TIP- THE LADY DID A GREAT JOB SO I GAVE HER 5 BUCKS.  Make sure you tip, it is the right thing to do.   Simple , southern food done incredibly well.  We will be going back.  If they served breakfast there it would be nice .....HINT, HINT."}
{"text":"My GPS brought me here thinking that it was still the captains galley. I was looking for something besides fast food for lunch. I got the London style fish and chips. It was excellent, nothing short of spectacular."}
{"text":"No stars for you.   OK I was forced to give them one ill deserved star or I couldn't post.   This place served the worst food I've ever eaten.  I'm surprised that they're still in business"}
{"text":"Look, this is classic dining right here.  Old fashioned? Sure!  But that's ok.  The food is about 3.5 stars, but I bump them to four for having a WIDE range of choices and doing every one of them well. Service was wonderful and friendly and made me feel like I was visiting a friend's house.  The prices are extremely reasonable, especially given the amount of food, and refills came often on the drinks. Hushpuppies are so very delicious here."}
{"text":"I used the to-go service on the side of the restaurant; they get you in and out fast if you call into them. Best seafood place I have found in North Charlotte/Huntersville. Fried seafood platter is pretty good."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for dine in and multiple times for take out! I can't get enough of the \"baked chicken\" special on Mondays & Fridays. This place is nothing fancy, but everything great for a comfort food meal. I've taken my 3 year old several times and he always loves it too. They have lots of boat decor which kept him excited. Our waitress, Michelle, took such great care of us and went above and beyond to make my little man feel so special. I adore when servers speak so kindly to my little boy and include him in ordering and friendly conversations.  Other food we love: macaroni & cheese & fried okra. Also - the strawberry shortcake dessert is yummy - simple, but delicious. I love that it is often frozen on the inside which makes me feel like I'm eating ice cream cake! A few fresh strawberries on top would put this dessert over the top!  Will continue to make this a frequent stop in and take out spot for my family!"}
{"text":"First visit here and the place is huge. Very friendly staff greeted us when we walked in. Our waitress was polite and attentive. Menu is huge with so many selections. I had chicken and dumplings which was very good. Portions are so generous and everything is reasonably priced. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good After Church Family Restaurant  The building this restaurant is in, has had three different restaurants in it within the last three years.  First it was a Captains Galley, then the Lighthouse and now it is Huntersville Family Restaurant. We were told that the original owners of the Captains Galley had taken back the restaurant and reopened it as Hunterville Family Restaurant so a number of the old dishes that Captains Galley offered were on the current menu  That said, we arrived just before they opened at 11:00 am on Sunday and were promptly seated.  My wife ordered a Pittsburgh Salad (yeah it has French Fries on top) along with a Rib Eye  and I had the Fish and Chips.  The Fish was excellent but the Fries were only partially cooked and were soggy with oil.  Not very good.  Service was great but the decor has not been updated since the days of the Captain's Galley.  Could use a bit of a touch up and less of a nautical theme.  All in all, it was good. They do promote themselves as a Southern Restaurant and outside of the Southern Fish Camp environment, very little about the menu or the atmosphere is Southern."}
{"text":"Went with four children, which can sometimes be challenging. But the waitress was so kind and understanding. The food was delicious and the portions generous. It was a very pleasant visit and I would recommend, especially to families."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, wide selection on the menu. The service is good. I had the chicken pasta i found it very good, wife had a burger she said it was great"}
{"text":"If you aren't a local you don't receive anywhere near a normal level of service. It does seem to be a friendly neighborhood restaurant, but when you come in and are clearly not recognized by the wait staff and younger by most patrons by 30 years they treat you like shit. Long waits, poor service, mediocre food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place with a Family menu.  I took my son and he had a Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was a single and huge, with big onion rings.....  He loved it.  I had the daily special, which was baked chicken.   Overall pretty decent.  The prices are pretty inexpensive.  They also have a board with posted specials.     The menu had a lot of seafood items, this was a fish house after all."}
{"text":"This place is nothing fancy, but the food was more than acceptable for the price we paid. There are tons of choices on the menu with multiple daily specials to choose from. They also kept seafood platter options from Captains Galley menu. We were really surprised by portion sizes. Wait staff are nice and attentive. Great for family's on a budget. I will definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"Crab cakes were good. The breading was a bit tough. Collards, hush puppies, & Mac n cheese were delicious. Huge menus with great selection. Plenty of tables. They cater."}
{"text":"Honey butter chicken. Need I say more?   It was the most perfectly fried chicken I have had in a very long time. All homemade, crispy onion rings hand battered, and a cucumber salad that was refreshing after the sweetness of the honey butter sauce.   The staff were extremely welcoming even though we had an infant with us. That can sometimes create problems for waitstaff even if those problems are perceived. Excellent food, excellent service, dining room needs a little update, but overall a really great stop on our trip."}
{"text":"I visit the place weekly if not several times a week. You can't beat the prices and great selection of food. Best restaurant in town. Take out or dine in great food always."}
{"text":"Classic calabash and more! The servings are HUGE! My fiancé and I definitely could of split a platter! I got the popcorn shrimp and oysters. Oysters were good size and not over fried! For the amount of food you get it's a fair price! Decor is dated but who cares thats what makes it classic! I probably wouldn't of eaten here from the outside looks but don't be fooled! Staff was very friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"I came here for a good old-fashioned Tarheel fried seafood feast.  I was a little scared when I saw how the width and breadth of the menu (some places that try to stretch themselves too thin are unable to make it all good).  However, when I learned they were run by Greeks my spirits picked up.  For some reasons Greeks are the masters at these diverse restaurants.  The mac and cheese was the only disappointment.  I had fried shrimp and deviled crab which were excellent.  And I think I ate a metric ton of their hush puppies.  And all the staff was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere... Very reminiscent of an old timey restaurant. LARGE portions for a very reasonable price. The serve is great... Very friendly and management comes around to check/wait on you during your meal. They offer take out which I will definitely consider on a cold/rainy/snowy night."}
{"text":"The food was definitely home style.  I could not BELIEVE the bowl full of mayonnaise they brought out for my steak sandwich.  It was so big I literally thought it was a bowl of pudding.  The steak sandwich was good (it was a ribeye on a regular hamburger bun, which I did not eat). The fries were good.  They had a nice selection at frighteningly low prices...but the food turned out to be passable in spite of being so inexpensive I thought it must be government subsidized somehow.   The restaurant is definitely the type of place to go if you have kids; so ridiculously inexpensive and has that home style atmosphere...big-night-out-for- the-trailer-park kind of feeling.  But in a nice way.  The reason I blow this up to four stars instead of three is that I'm not sure I've ever been anywhere where the staff was so friendly and helpful.  I really did feel like I was in their home and was welcome to be there.  I like places like this."}
{"text":"Friendly and affordable. Very much a family atmosphere. Nothing fancy, definitely a country feel.  The fish and chips were great and the kids liked the fried pickles and spaghetti."}
{"text":"Just noticed they had opened in the old captains galley location yesterday. Went there for lunch today. Short review here.  Good service, best chicken livers I've ever had , best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Great iced tea.  According to my co worker great seafood also. And HUGE portions. Overall the best family style restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for an early dinner and had a good meal with friendly service at a good price.  We both think that it's run by the same people who used to run Captain's Galley in the same location and that they just chose more of a country cooking type menu for this venture.  All in all it's what you would expect menu wise with daily specials and sides as well as ones that are available everyday.  There is a section of the menu with fried/broiled seafood, one with Italian dishes and the standards like country style steak, fried chicken, chicken livers and onions as well as various sandwiches and a couple burgers.  My wife had the country style steak which is served on rice.  It needed a good dose of salt and pepper at the table but the chopped steak was tender, pretty tasty and there was plenty of it.  I had a combo of fried fantail shrimp and fried oysters which were both big and plump, not too heavily breaded and served crispy and piping hot with fries, hushpuppies and coleslaw. Again, a lot of food for the price and it was good.  We also had small garden salads to start and the dressings are homemade and so much better than the bottled off the shelf junk you get at many places (you listening Hickory Tavern?).  It's nice to have a place nearby cooking some good country food and serving it with a smile. We'll be back..."}
