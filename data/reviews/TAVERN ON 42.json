{"text":"This place is horrible due to the bartenders they have their I was charged for a $3 Coke when I asked for a Coke wash for my shot and when I mentioned it to the bartender she took my shot and dumped it out and tell me to get out I proceeded to tell her I wanted my money back for the pop and shot that I did not drink and she started calling me out of my name I have never in my life seen a bartender behave in such a manner when I am a bartender myself I will never go to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way, service really depends on whose tending bar. It started off with well below par service, shift change and service got better. Don't go by the specials on the wall, they don't change. The food  was above quality for a a dive/biker bar. Chicken wrap and tots was great. The wife and kid had no complaints about the food either. They had gotten a , $5 on Friday, and Buffalo chicken Mac n cheese. Good experience except start of service."}
{"text":"Not from the area but was very impress! Everyday they have a deal going on and it's pretty cheap when it comes to drinks. Wouldn't suggest coming to watch a game due to the odd angles the TVs are but good atmosphere. Didn't go on a \"busy\" day so I'm not sure how they are but I was glad with the Customer Service. Wings were 40 cents and they were pretty good. Suggest experiencing for yourself"}
