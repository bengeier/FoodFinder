{"text":"First time I had ever had Iraqi food. I met a friend there for a business lunch, she loves Mediterranean food and wanted me to try it and this location was halfway for both of us. The staff was pleasant, restaurant was clean, and food was fresh. I had the chicken kabob sandwich and thought it was wonderful. I did feel like a fish out of water and all eyes were on us. Not sure we were welcomed but other than that the food was great."}
{"text":"The best IRAQI restaurant in town. Food is very tasty clean & cheaply priced. There were lots of extra free dishes of appetizers. They even gave us free tea.  Everything is great. I will definitely come back here & will become a regular.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was a difficult rating to determine. I thought the flavor was delicious My wife had the beef gyro and I had the beef shawarma the beef was perfectly seasoned and the sauce on both sandwiches were awesome and very delicious. They start with lentil soups that is one of the best I have ever had. We ordered a platter as an appetizer and the hummus was excellent but the only thing on the platter that stood our. No why not a 4 rating, well for a few reasons.   1. I ordered the chicken but got beef.  2. Not a fan of the bread large authentic pita. (my wife loved it but I just wasn't a fan),  3. Got a dip platter but had to ask for bread. However, after we asked they brought enough bread for the dips we had normally you have to order extra at restaurants to finish the hummus. 4. The TV was blasting a Middle Easter version of X Factor 5,Finally this place was very authentic, dare I say too authentic for me. I know the goal and even an advertising technique is \"Authentic ________ Food!\" The truth is there are some authenticities to Middle Easter food I don't like and they hit them with the bread used and other dips.  Ultimately I like my food mildly Americanized.    So please don't be mistake this was a good middle eastern restaurant and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some good authentic Mediterranean food, but I can't justify a 4 rating. ."}
{"text":"Great food. Specially chicken and beef kababs. Bread was awesome. Half chicken was very dry so need to improve on that and make it more juicier and soft. Great Customer Service surely we ll come again."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and had an extended lunch break! Stopped in on a whim and it's the best whim I've ever followed. It's a hole-in-the-wall spot, with a lot of unique decor and a \"mom and pop restaurant\" feel.  The food is delicious. I ordered a chicken kabob sandwich, and I thought the chicken was well seasoned and the Iraqi bread had a wonderful texture. There was just enough food to fill me up, but I didn't feel like I had eaten too much! The sandwiches were very affordable. I'll be back the next time I'm in North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in this of the town they have great food I'm not sure what was the sandwich called but it's the same as gyro but Iraqi style which was my first time to try."}
{"text":"I ve been in every single Mediterranean restaurant in Phoenix, and I can tell , this one is the best in all . Free tea, and sometimes free Appetizer. Affordable price with the best quality of service and food. I stopped once, qnd now im there almost every day. ."}
{"text":"Found this place on google on a short visit to Phoenix. Wasn't sure I want to come In when I got there but I'm glad I did. Very nice, quite and clean place. Bashar the owner is a very pleasant guy and all the people who worked there were awesome. Food was excellent. Tasty and well cooked. The salad was fresh Make sure not to leave before having a cup of tea. It's really good IRAQI tea"}
{"text":"Great Iraqi food. Owners are very hospitable and friendly. Had the beef shawarma. We had a group of 9 and the food came out quickly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So yummy! This place rocks. I get take out and eat in often. The yellow lentil soup is delicious! Get the yellow rice, it's the best around! My favorite dish is the chicken tekha. Service is great and there are large portions too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in just to see where all the music and laughter was coming from. The food was amazing and the waiter explained everything. It was very authentic and delicious. We ordered the works from appetizers to a wonderful traditional end of meal tea. It came out to around $25 for 2. I would eat there daily if I could."}
{"text":"Ok went into these place ,I'm the only person there tried to order a sandwich was told it take 25 min .So I order something that didn't look like chicken in a half ass bun.The Poor Quality of the food was a big turn off needlessly to say I didn't finish the sandwich.Would I recommend these place to anyone that would be a Big No. rate these place a Big F plus ."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Beef and chicken kabob are fantastic. Lentil soup was the dark horse of the entire meal, so good. Hidden gem in PHX. Oh and my Paki father in law approves so that mean something !"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for falafel on the west side and found this place via Yelp. Very charming interior and friendly service. The most amazing and unique falafel sandwich I've ever had! Everything was prepared fresh, so it took a few minutes, but it was completely worth the wait. We had hummus and some falafel pitas. Everything was delicious and the pitas were a stand out for their texture and unique shape. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The choices on the menu are good, I ordered the Iraqi Beef Kabob sandwich and it didn't have any moisture, I was choking on the food. The fries that we had were like the ones we make at home, except they were extremely bland and didn't have taste (might as well have not ordered and made it at home)  I would not recommend money to be spent here. Their prices are too high for low quality food. Their plates are small and a lot of the food falls off the plate and gets wasted. Terrible, terrible place"}
{"text":"Delicious food, all made fresh when you order it. Their chicken and yellow rice plate with fresh vegetables is to die for! They have various selection of Mediterranean dishes and the fresh hot bread they serve is also amazing."}
{"text":"Served the food burned although replaced I would have expected a refund for about 45 min wasted over the whole ordeal"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I love how fresh the food is, full of exciting flavors. I  imagine that the recipes were passed down from generation to generation. The hummus has the most amazing texture. The baba ganouj was so full of flavor. I cannot wait to eat here again. It's worth the drive from Montana :-)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but food is really good. Actually a clean and nice place! Try the beef kebabs for sure. Authentic soup and kebabs!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money, walked into this place, and it was very disorganized, the food smelled good so decided to give them a chance, I ordered fries, 4 Iraqi kabob sandwiches, and hummus, they never offered water, fries were ridiculous, they charged $4 for it, and I can get more fries and better quality fries at a dollar menu at McDonalds, the hummus was a small plate with no bread included for $4, I wouldn't pay more the $2 so I returned it to them since they didn't offer bread with it, the sandwiches barely had meat in it, they were dry, no Tahani or garlic sauce in it, terrible service, terrible attitude, will never even recommend my worst friends to eat here."}
{"text":"If there was zero star, i would give it to their restaurant, we were never offered any drinks or least water, food was not up to expectations, can u imagine no sauce in your sandwich , just meat n veggies, thats how bad it was, over priced hummus with no bread , i can make better fries than them, will never return or recommend"}
{"text":"Thanks to our friend who invited us to this nice place that we had a chance to enjoy on Tuesday Night. I was kinda not hungry but I was ok since it was Mediterranean food. Long story short, we were welcomed with smiling faces, a very kind attitude and of course clean, tidy restaurant with delicious food. The hospitality was great. With the combo of 2 ,you start of with lental soup which is very very good. Then,  you get the appetizers of babaganus (incredibly good), cold veggie grilled and sliced salad, pepper, okra, beans, cucumber, tomato, onion, olive (prolly missing some of them I can't remember but the list is long, and astonishing bread for free. In other words, you have a chance of getting full by just appetizers. After that, the combo is way too large to finish to be honest. You might have a chance to taste chicken adana kebap, hand made gyro (you will see the difference why hand made gyro is way more delicious compared to other gyros) and  and some traditional kebabs and skewers at one single plate. I highly suggest you to stop by this restaurant if you are looking for a clean and very good quality restaurant. Or, if you ever liked the food of persian room, you will have the hard time to describe the quality of the food here ! Don't let The location and the interior downgrade your expectations. This place will just surprise you !"}
{"text":"I was not expecting this much tasty food at all. There were 7 side dishes for free. We ordered \" combo for 2 \" although we were 3 people, couldn't finish. It was worth driving here for 22 miles. I hope they keep the quality as well as the smiling face."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a month ago looking for a good food, but the owner treated me so bad to a point he asked me that why I came to his restaurant. It seems to me that if you are from certain countries you aren't welcome to this restaurant because when I said where I'm from, he changed his attitude toward me. The food is good tho."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Two thumbs up. A must try. Friend took me and it was the best middle eastern cuisine I've had in all of Phoenix"}
{"text":"Best Arabic food ever ,The food delicious with great customer service .I would definitely give them five stars"}
{"text":"Best Iraqi restaurant in Phoenix and the whole United States! I have been to every single middle eastern/ Mediterranean restaurant in Phoenix area, and this one is with no doubt the best! Great hospitality from the owner and staff, you should try their lamb tekka and beef shawerma. And don't forget the \"Qoozi\". Simply the best!"}
{"text":"Got a carry-out order from the snooty lady up front. I found the food to be Bland & my baba ganoush lacked smokiness with overwhelmingly garlicky flavor.  The ground beef kabob had no flavor,  when I gave them to my dog, she refuse to eat it .    Only one out of my 2 minion would eat the kabob.    We probably will not return. I saw another table of 4 paying for their meal, they left huge un-eatened portions on their table, although most of the appetizers were consumed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I loved the menu. But my husband and I were  extremely disappointed. We both ordered the falafel sandwich combo. They served a plain sandwich with NO sauce. Yes you read that correct. They served a DRY sandwich which meant absolutely NO flavor. Whoever wrote the rave review about their falafel sandwich clearly doesn't get out much. As an added insult, they served us a toddler size portion of french fries, which were soaked with oil and terribly undercooked and unseasoned. The cherry on top was their beverage selection. Choosing a can of soda from the fridge isn't exactly what I was looking for as I don't drink soda. I left the unfinished plate, paid for the meal, and ran put as quickly ad I could. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"This place caught my  attention because they are still open when I drive by at 11:30 PM. So I went in and got some takeout. Small, only 6 tables and 7 chairs at the \"bar\".   Took a long 30 minutes to get my food but was well worth it.  The 2 person combo was only $24 and had enough food to feed 3.  I did find the meat and rice to be a bit dry, but adding some hot butter and sauce at home fixed that. I also noticed this place is always filled with Iraq diners, so that is a good sign--the locals always know where to get real Iraq food.  If you like meat and rice you can't beat it.  Cafe Saravejo, my other favorite place is next door."}
