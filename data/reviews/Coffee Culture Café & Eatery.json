{"text":"Had a group meeting here and stayed for the better part of a day. The staff didn't hassle us once which was nice however the atmosphere felt a bit commercial and sterile. The coffee and snacks were decent, I got a delicious White Chocolate Mocha which definitely warmed me up. Free and decently fast wi-fi as well!"}
{"text":"I really used to like Coffee Culture.. The drinks are decent and some of the food items are pretty good. The staff were always nice and friendly. However, looks like recently they got all new staff including a new store manager and unfortunately, the service is AWFUL!! They are beyond slow, don't know the menu items and are just generally not welcoming or friendly.

The other day I walked in and made eye contact with one of the workers, who was chatting with his co-worker as she attempted to complete a food order (she didn't know how to make it and the customer had clearly been waiting a long time), he didn't even acknowledge that I'd entered the cafe or say that he'd be with me in a minute because he was 'busy'.. I waited at the cash register for almost 5 minutes and was about to leave before anyone even took notice that I was trying to give them my money.

I have several years of coffee shop work experience, so I know how service should be at these places and this type of service is just not on. I don't expect you to drop everything and roll out the red carpet when I arrive, but at least greet your customers and try not to make them wait a ridiculous amount of time to get in and out of your store. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.

I gave it 2 stars rather than one just because it's a decent place to sit and do work on your laptop if you can tolerate the staff for long enough to get your order."}
{"text":"Visited twice on the same day, several hours apart. Both times the seat at the end of the bar was filled by the same man reading a newspaper while staring at each patron passing by. His presence seemed odd compared to the rest of the clientele and atmosphere and was slightly off putting as he seemed better suited to a run down bar with heavy smokers. 

For both visits I ordered a chiller. The peach chiller was great as the chickie who made it managed to get it incredibly smooth. She seemed slightly confused when I ordered, and for a moment I wondered if she wasn't new (how do you not know that a 16oz is  large and a 12oz is small?). The flavor was bright, crisp, and was not overly sweet. It was surprisingly refreshing and tasted like peaches. On the second visit, I ordered a strawberry chiller. This time, it was made by a different girl. She did not get it nice and smooth. The ice chips were still rather big by the time it came to me. It was a bit of a struggle to drink due to the grittiness. 

I wish the drinks had been consistently made, but otherwise, this isn't a bad place to sit and relax for a little bit. They have a faux fire place, and are rather clean. The earthy bronze colors are very inviting."}
{"text":"By it's own virtue, Coffee Culture is a perfectly acceptable cafe. Lots of great seating with views, friendly service and nice selection of products. It's pretty non-objectionable. 

Being surrounded by indie operations, it's only saving grace is the amazing hours. One of the very few cafe's to be open to midnight. Thankfully it's a nice enough place to still be able to enjoy the twilight hours."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better for ALL Around benefits to coming here. every Morning I get up and make me way to my \"Office\" here for around 6:30AM which is the time they open. The Music is always at a perfect tempo and variety, (from Classical and Jazz to Pop and Rock) the staff are very helpful - and includes table service of your order.

The variety of menu options is great - from a bagel and cream cheese or English Muffin with egg and cheese (with or without sausage or bacon), Sandwiches that are incredible in quality - REALLY...a lot is put into them (E.g. the Philly Beef or Grilled Cheese)....it is almost gourmet. Don't forget about the Fresh baked muffins every morning and variety of pastries and cookies too. (I like the peanut butter cookies) - On a hot day the Chillers are great....I recommend the Mango on a really HOT day :) -

The place is usually filled with students working on papers but also attracts a regular retired crowd mostly the \"Little Italy\" folk - and young teens at lunch time (which is the only louder time...but it passes...and they are all good kids.

 The Place is super clean and bathrooms are  always spic and span too. The whole place has a HUGE east facing window which brings in tonnes of natural light...a large outside patio outside with nice chairs and tables...and I believe there is even plug-ins outside for your laptop if you want to enjoy the fresh air....and the neighborhood is very friendly (not busy)  The WIFI is pretty good for 99% of the time...but has that 1% slow time...it passes fast. Oh, and they close at 12AM (midnight)! which makes it the latest open Coffee Shop around with WIFI...and this is EVERY DAY! :) There are lots of plugs (every booth near the window) and feel free to ask someone to share the other side of the booth if it's filled, everybody is usually cool with sharing. There are 6 booths - 4.5 have  a PLUG - so that's about 10 that can be plugged in all the time.

Oh yeah...there Coffee Loyalty Card is a \"Buy 10 get 2 FREE\" which is unseen anywhere...and just to give you an example of prices over all - My Breakfast of and Earl Grey Tea and an English Muffin with Egg and Cheese cost $4.18 total with tax. My Tea is $1.75 the Sandwich is $2.29.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate place to get your coffee on! The chocolate chip muffins were of the utmost high quality, not that second rate Second Cup or Starbucks variety... The fruity chiller drinks are very tasty but melt a little quicker than I'd hoped. The wireless is spotty as hell though constantly disconnecting every 2 mins. Would recommend to visit as a daily coffee stop."}
{"text":"I don't know about the quality but their respect to the customers is worst ever. I never faced this kind of embarrassment ever in my life, it was the worst experience.

We went into on of the stores and occupied a table right away, and planned to order once one of my agents arrive there but the owner of the store came to us and demanded us to order right away, her exact words were \"You need to order and then sit, I am not allowing you to occupy the table unless you order\". She is not even allowing us to wait for a minute. 

We came to a compromise and one of us went to order, she then demanded us all to vacate the table and then place the order. She went so far that she threatened us that she will call the police, we were waiting for that as well.

If Coffee Culture is a place only to drink my coffee and not for our meetings then I am not for it, sorry we have a lot of Tim Horton's who are very friendly and don't care how long we use their tables.

An advise to Coffee Culture, please put a board outside your stores mentioning that, customers can only occupy the tables after placing an order."}
{"text":"Great find on College Street east of Bathurst. Has wi-fi, comfy seating, opens late and above all, great service. Looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"Great little cozy spot on College Street free wifi and great seating."}
{"text":"I needed to get some work done in the area and saw this spot with lots of seating. I've been to other CC's and the coffee was good. I liked how this one has bar stools facing college st. Towards the back there is a fireplace, TV and 3 big red chairs which looked comfortable. Service is good. As far as 'chains' go, it's not quite as good as Starbucks or Second Cup to me, but still better than Tim Horton's, McDonalds, etc."}
{"text":"I decided to check it out on my way to grab lunch since it was raining! Not a bad atmosphere with plenty of space, and the menu looks pretty yummy.

Got a medium coffee and a muffin, both of which were good but not exemplary. For the price, ($5.20 total with tax) it was pretty good!

The service was just... ok. The woman who served me got my size and order wrong even though I was the only person in line? The other workers were neither friendly nor rude, so I suppose further investigations are in order.

Not a bad place to study since the music is pretty quiet and it's big enough that its comfortable even when packed! Plus, free wi-fi."}
{"text":"The staff are great and the coffee is too.  I like the decor and atmosphere. I especially like the warm cozy feeling inside. 

ALSO Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff ^^ 

Came here for breakfast and it wasn't very busy either 

Really good breakfast too - and quick. Coffee with a cheese and egg english muffin were perfect, good price as well."}
{"text":"Coffee and food are quite good but the staff are discourteous and rude. I will never use this place again."}
{"text":"There's something about Coffee Culture that I like. Maybe it's the windows, or the friendly owner/operator who always seems on top of things. But it's probably the light. Gorgeous picture windows wrapping around a classic Toronto corner lot facing east, complete with patio, combined with the rich wood interior and spacious booths offer a nice balance that's missing from many coffee shops. And the coffee's good too! A great alternative to the more hyper Starbucks atmosphere, I heartily recommend Coffee Culture."}
{"text":"Great comfortable atmosphere The coffee is superb quality.  I have also eaten here, and the food is as good as the coffee.  So good and fresh it is much better than most high end restaurants.  Pastries are very fresh.  Service is great. I would go back and I do over and over."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little unassuming cafe, an oasis of calm in a busy area. Comfortable seating (with a patio for warmer months) and nice big windows looking out onto College means you can - and I have - spend hours there and be happy. 

There is a pretty good drink menu, with fairly standard stuff you'd find at a Timothy's or Second Cup, but it's quite good quality despite this - I mean, I like a good espresso from Manic across the street, but I often feel more at home at Coffee Culture and their okay coffee. There's also quite a large selection of desserts on offer, and you can often grab a drink/cake special of some type.

Staff are friendy and helpful, and even though it's counter service i've often had the barista offer to bring my drink over once i've ordered and paid. There's generally some sort of muzak playing in the background but it's never too loud and doesn't border on annoying current pop music - i'm pretty certain this only helps people want to stay and spend more time & $$!

With free wifi and long hours, plus all of the above, I keep going back. Sometimes you just want comfortable. Hey, maybe they should rename this place Coffee Comfortable.."}
{"text":"- not sure where the 4 star average is coming from. 
- this seems like a decent spot for studying, cozying up with a good book, catching up with a friend
- however, the coffee is crap. sorry let me rephrase. i'm not a huge coffee nut, but the fact that their espresso machine is a one-button contraption saddens me... because i paid almost $4 for a weak latte.
- think the only reason this place was busy on sunday morning was because of all the peeps waiting outside of aunties and uncles in the cold."}
{"text":"Good coffee for less than $2 a cup, yay! Organic free trade for only 10 cents more? Meh why not. Pedro in Bolivia probably can use the 10 cents anyways.

I love a coffee place where you can order good coffee at a reasonable price and you don't have to speak a special barrista lingo to order it. There's plenty of seating; I especially like the comfy leather chairs by the \"fireplace\" and flat screen TV.

I read that there were plugs at every table but from what I could tell, it was only at 4 booths along one wall by the windows.

A great place to grab a cup of joe in Little Italy. 

Oh and there's free WiFi FTW!"}
{"text":"Today I really felt like going out and eat something sweet and good after lunch, so after a few minutes of yelping and looking for interesting suggestions near me, this place was one of the first that caught my attention.

So happy I have discovered this cozy place near Jane Station. The first sensation when I opened the door felt so good, decoration is nice, temperature pleasant and warm and they placed a simulated fireplace near the door that feels very cozy.

There is plenty of space that can accomodate a lot of people, and every seat is spacious and comfortable - I love it when places like this have big, comfy armchairs that allow you to relax and enjoy the moment, which was the case.

I had a regular coffee with double milk and a rockslide brownie. The brownie was incredible, with chunks of salty caramel that melted in your mouth and walnuts - it was 100% what my sweet craving needed! According to my spouse, the NY Cheesecake was pretty spectacular too. It really looked spongy and delicious, will try it next time.

I would have given five stars to this place, but I removed one star because the coffee was not very good, a small disappointment compared with the tasty pastries that we were eating. It was a bit cold and slightly watery. But again my coffee was regular and had nothing to do with the specialties on the menu, I will have to come back and try another type of coffee to be able to review with a better perspective."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is pretty standard coffee selection. It does offer nice sandwiches and sides to pair with drinks and pricing is fair. It is very accessible by streetcar or short walk from university and college. Best thing about this shop is pricing and location."}
{"text":"A decent mainstay of the College and Bathurst scene. A seemingly independent coffee shop that offers decent coffees and a wide range of pastries, sandwiches and a okay chili. Decent decor and a mixed crowd of students and annex regulars. This place lacks the pretension of some more up market coffee places without the crammed in lacklusternesss of a standard starbucks or 2nd Cup."}
{"text":"A nice, simple little coffee shop, which is a rare thing in TO. This is just a coffee shop with decent food, good coffee and nice big booths. I didn't think places like this still existed.  Most of the coffee places here are either take-it-so-seriously-you-disappear-up-your-own-bum type places or Starbucks. And they're open late, which is good if you find yourself in need of a coffee before bedtime."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine place to sit an read or study. The coffee is good, lots of treats to eat and the staff are good and keep the place tidy."}
{"text":"I stepped in here for a second because it looked friendlier than the neighbouring coffee joints. 

I don't drink coffee, so I ordered a tea. The price was standard (think Second Cup, Timothy's) for a thing of hot water with a teabag in it. They had a display of sweets and cookies and stuff that tempted me.

It seemed like a place to spend a few hours, maybe, if you had a paper to write or a book to get through. Less cozy than the Second Cups I frequent. In fact, I kind of got a weird Tim-Hortons-with-darker-lighting feel here. And it's a far shot from the best tea and coffee places I've been to."}
{"text":"If you need to get work done and don't want anything too fancy this is the place! A Caesar wrap and coffee will set you back $9 with left overs(if you're a little person like me). Staff are friendly with a good mix of customers, no pretentiousness bring l your trashy novels here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The owners are also very nice. Great place to come work in a relaxing environment. The coffee's decent, as are the snacks. Oh, and the AC.... mmmm AC.. so nice in the summer months :)"}
{"text":"Yes! Another coffee shop in the downtown core with late hours-what a godsend. Thanks to yelpers for putting this on the map!

Though it's another franchise albeit an Ontario one, everything at Coffee Culture is tailored for a comfortable experience each visit. Prices are fantastic too, easily cheaper than the other 'gourmet or serious' cafes around town and the service is warm, no worries about feeling intimadated by coffee snobs or whatnot. Comfy booths and tables are available for work, studying or general browsing courtesy of the free wifi! they have here. Desserts look like the decadent la rocca type.

Music is bad I have to agree with the others, obviously an general feed and not an ipod but one can always tune out. 

The best about this place is the hours-open late and not starbucks or tim hortons."}
{"text":"Garbage. Dont buy anything more than a coffee or bottled drink. Sandwiches are garbage and pastries are tim hortons quality but more expensive."}
{"text":"A place to share a study session with fellow intellects, hipsters and internet hoarders. Coffee Culture features this audience but also serves up some dirty coffee for your late night needs.

Open til 1am, it's the perfect spot to download movies and music while procrastinating. Other than having a hard time finding a seat, it's even harder to find an open electrical outlet sometimes. I guess that's why Mac Books are abundant and PC's are absent. Then again, maybe it's just a hipster thing...

Other than free wifi and closing at 1am, Coffee Culture has their workers serve you at your table. Necessary when waiting for a seat seems to be more important than waiting for your beverage."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The red velvet muffin is the best I have ever had. The staff is very friendly. Today was a free coffee day from 6am-3pm!!"}
{"text":"Had a specialty coffee and was wrong. Manager said too bad nothing I can do. $5 waste of money, took one sip and returned it."}
{"text":"Located on college street this place stays open past midnight, so if you are craving a midnight dessert this is a good place to go to :) you will like it for its chocolate desserts."}
{"text":"Came in for a coffee after some fatty lunch at Caplansky's.  Nice clean place, maybe a third-full with patrons.  Combo of booths and tables, and a little electric fireplace with chairs at the back.

Got their milder regular coffee for $1.90.  Comes to $2 even with taxes - yeah it's dumb but I like when it evens out like that.

Coffee was great - nice and smooth, and the service was friendly and quick.  If I'm in this area and need a coffee, this place is it.  They have other fancier coffees and treats too (see some of the menus other reviewers provided) if you're looking for a one-stop-shop for lunch and your après-lunch beverage."}
{"text":"I was looking for a cafe to study at until late hours and I came across this place. I'm not sure about the hours, but I came on a Tuesday afternoon and found out that it closes at 11PM, not at midnight!!

I was in the mood for a cold drink so I decided to get a Power-Up Smoothie ($5.50). This is the best smoothie I've ever had (better than any I've made at least). So fruity and not sour at all.

The lady that helped me was so sweet and had such a warm smile. She knew I was going to grab a seat so she told me to go ahead and she delivered my drink to me when it was ready, which I thought was so cute!

The other two workers were not as nice as she was. They were pretty slow to help others, especially when it started approaching closing time.

I had food leftover from lunch in my bag so I was going to eat it while I studied, but the male worker came up to me and stopped me. I thought it would be okay to eat it since I did buy from their menu, but I thought wrong. That made me a little sad, but I guess that was to be expected.

The cafe was pretty small, but it had a very nice environment. The music was very jazzy and not distracting at all. There's also free wifi and outlets at the booths, so it was a perfect place to get some studying done.

Will definitely come by here again! 4/5"}
{"text":"Would have given them 0 stars if I could. My friend and I came here at 7:30PM and after buying a coffee each and one of their brownies, we were asked to leave the cafe at 8:00PM because we were the only customers in the store. The reason we came here was because we saw online that this place closes at 10PM and wanted to come do homework together. The \"manager\" told us he's closing shop and we have to leave. 
I understand that it is a waste of money to stay open when there are no customers but we were paying customers, will just go to Starbucks next time. So much for supporting a Canadian company, this place was a disappointment, the coffee sucked, the food sucked and the service was horrendous. Save your money, don't come here."}
{"text":"This, just 30 minutes ago, was my second time here in a week. I won't be coming back. Food is decent enough but the staff are so unfriendly, made me even feel uncomfortable. Maybe because I was using a coupon, I don't know. But my total bill was over $28. But this was my last time. So much for marketing!"}
{"text":"Unlike other coffee shops in the area, this place is not full of douchery.  The prices are reasonable, the grilled cheese is great and the internet is free."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop with warm atmosphere. 

Get your coffee and relax in one of the leather chairs near the fireplace. 

Reasonable prices and great treats; I had the poppy seed loaf which was moist and delicious."}
{"text":"I haven't visited this location before the management changed so I can't say much about the service before. However, when I visited on a Saturday morning for breakfast, I was sorely disappointed by the service. The young woman who manned the cash and coffee bar was unpleasant and looked like she wanted to be anywhere but at work. I was going to order the grilled cheese but was told they only served it on multi-grain bread (which I'm allergic to). I asked for any substitutes and she said \"no, we only serve it on multi-grain\". The least she could have done was suggest, I don't know, a bagel? An english muffin? I ended up ordering a breakfast bagel instead with a coffee and cookie. The coffee and cookie were both great. The service was a bit of a put-off but if you're only here for a cup of joe and the wifi, this is the place for you. You definitely won't be bothered by the staff here."}
{"text":"I drop in here on occasion and it's pretty good. Nice atmosphere with ample seating,  free wifi and the staff are very friendly. Tried a few things on the menu and have to say the asiago breakfast sandwich is quite delish! My kid LOVES the healthy harvest muffin -- and if you go early in the morning it's still hot from the oven and still in the pan.

I really enjoy the dark roast, but man their coffee is freaking hot. I have to let it sit for a long while before I can drink it. I also buy the ground beans here because the flavour is great and they are relatively inexpensive compared to most chain coffee joints.

Love having Coffee Culture in the hood! (It's also a good place to take your laptop to do some work.)"}
{"text":"Love the relaxed atmosphere, and friendly owners. The Asiago BLT is my favourite sandwich to get, and they make a great London Fog as well. 

This is my preferred coffee shop to visit (I find other chains are always a bit chaotic and too loud)."}
{"text":"I'm sick of paying $5 a cup and dealing with the fashion show at Manic Coffee.  

I'm fed up with the early closing time and shoddy wireless at Kahawa.

I hate running into my loser ex-brother-in-law while playing the table wars that is Starbucks.   

In a neighborhood where everything strives to be more and more different, sometimes it takes a cookie-cutter outlet to actually deliver the experience that the other local shops try for.

Coffee Culture is EXACTLY what this area of town needs.

Awesome coffee.   Comfortable tables.   Great location.  WiFi that works.   Long late hours.

Horrible piped-in music that makes you want to work and not cave into distraction."}
{"text":"An OK place to study. I'm not a fan of their house blend at all but for the cost I can't complain, since I only ever find myself in here for the Wi-Fi. Their hazelnut latte was good though. The place is a bit dark which makes reading hard especially if you're not at one of the booths. Music selection could be better... and quieter."}
{"text":"I can never connect to the Wifi here, so this is a big downside for this coffee shop. 
I've tried the coffee, and the brownie here, and both are pretty average.

The best thing about this coffee shop are that its huge(especially for College St) and it has large booths. It's also open till something like 1 am. 

Great place to study or catch up with someone, if you don't need the internet that is."}
{"text":"I'll try to keep this simple.  If you're sick of trying to find a seat at other coffee shops in the neighbourhood, you need to check this place out.  It just opened at College and Lippincott St..

Reasons:
1) FREE unlimited Wi-Fi. You don't have to be a slave to the 2hr limit Starbucks Wi-Fi, anymore.  And there are power outlets at EVERY table.
2) Very diverse menu, great coffee, chai lattes, frozen drinks, delicious pastries and killer deserts.  Although, the regular food is pretty awful.  Stick to coffee and you're golden.
3) The large flat screeen TV in the corner by the fireplace keeps you up to date on news and soccer.
4) Great service.

The only problem at the moment is the awful smooth jazz / worst songs of the 70's satellite music they play, but if you're the type to bring along ear buds or headphones, you can bring your own soundtrack.  

A killer place to study, work, & get your caffeine fix."}
{"text":"I found out about this cafe thanks to a response from Roma to a Yelp talk thread about late-night cafes in Toronto.  As anybody who's been to Toronto already knows, the city closes really early; and coffee shops in particular typically close at 6:00 or 7:00pm.  That's crazy to me, but that's how it is.  THIS PLACE, however, is open until midnight or 1:00am depending on the day.  There is free wi-fi (that rarely actually works) and reasonably comfortable seats/booths for late night working or studying.  Hooray!

The ambiance, coffee, pastries, and just about ever other aspect of the place scream out with purposeful mediocrity.  It has all the character and quality of a Second Cup or Starbucks, but more of a diner feel to it.  In some sense it really captures the feeling and mood of Toronto since it has no ambition to distinguish itself in any way.  A boring, ho-hum, average Joe sort of place where anybody could fit it because \"blah\" doesn't really clash with anything.  The place itself only merits 2 stars (making it comparable to Starbucks or Second Cup) except for the hours.  Being so far the ONLY cafe in Toronto open past 11:00pm that I've seen or heard of it gets an extra star.  I'll probably visit regularly for the sole reason of having no other options."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but a place to snack and use their finicky wifi."}
{"text":"Came here to study and the wifi didn't work..and the lady said she'd check up on it but never really got back to us. 
Also..the wifi signal is not very strong to begin with and the place is dimly lit (so it was kinda bad for reading books).
The servers were nice though! 

Just frustrated because I came here since the Internet was down at home and it ended up just not working here either so it defeated the purpose of coming."}
{"text":"I would give 5 five stars if not for the loud music. It's just loud. 

This is one of my favorite coffee places. Despite of the free wi fi, it does not feel and look like a library unlike what Starbucks have become. I'm a Starbucks cult member so I can not say that Coffee Culture's coffee is good. I do know though that their smoothie is A-W-E-S-O-M-E. 

Staff is friendly. 

The seats are comfortable and it's got HUGE window that makes reading a book wile sipping a hot chocolate more enjoyable. Huge windows can make a difference with your coffee experience. 

It has a roofless patio that's big enough to give at least 15 people a skin cancer...uhmm... a good tan. 

Do I recommend this? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Loved the:
- Comfy leather chairs
- Fireplace
- TV playing the soccer game
- Lots of outlets (but sadly not in my area)
- Free Wifi

I did not like the Butter Pecan Latte I got though... it was sort of repulsive!
Next time I will have to try a regular one."}
{"text":"I really appreciate that this place is open until 1am. As I write this, this place is filled with like-minded nerds bathed in the glow of their laptop screens. Like the intermittent Internet connection in this place, the coffee is mediocre at best, but I don't mind. Any place that serves joe and is open past 10pm, is aces in my book. Aces!

Wish the music was a little quieter."}
{"text":"I do enjoy my coffee. Its always nice to find a place with good customer service. If you are sick with dealing with the coffee snobs across the street, coffee culture is your place. I've only been in twice, but both times the service was amazing! Believe it or not, I didn't notice the bad music playing in the background, but I was only there for take-out. I'll keep my ears open next time I stop in."}
