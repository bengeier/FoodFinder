{"text":"Absolutely nothing special, felt gross after. Chicken fried rice was plain, Mongolian beef was rubbery and plain, General Tsao was decent, egg rolls were good. 

China One which used to be there was so much better. RIP."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try their diet plate as it was steamed with sauce on the side. My chicken was so raw I couldn't even eat it. Steamed ha! Was barely cooked. 

Then bought 2 orders of vege spring rolls that clearly had meat in it (pork no less) great cause I don't eat pork for religious reasons. 

Needless to say a waste of my time (since they're super busy) and money. NO thanks!"}
{"text":"This used to be China One, new owners. Unfortunately the food is not nearly as good as it was before. The service was fine though. Won't be going back. :("}
