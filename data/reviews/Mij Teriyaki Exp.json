{"text":"The yakisoba noodles here are always perfect! They give fair portions here. Super friendly and clean. Best terriyaki spot!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the price definetly not worth it. I got beef and chicken with rice and each dish was around 11 bucks which was a gigantic rip off it was like fast food Japanese honestly I can go to fredericks and get three dishes with bigger portions for half the price"}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years since it is on my way home from the gym. It isn't usually busy due to it not having much foot traffic, so you get served quickly. The Chicken/Beef Teriyaki is good, but I usually ask for extra of the meat since a regular serving doesn't fill in my opinion. Springrolls are good too as a side. Tried the spicy soups from them once, I don't recommend it. Everything else, enjoy!"}
