{"text":"Really impressed with this place. Had the big wally breakfast with French toast and I was stuffed! Big size portion. Would love to come back and try one on their souvklakis for dinner. Nice and clean as well. Definitely recommend for the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great service. My meal arrived super quick. Would certainly recommend the all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have been attending this restaurant for the last 6 months. I always ordered the same breakfast everytime. The usual bacon and eggs homfries ect which by the way is excellent. Gloria recommended that I try something different instead of the usual. Gloria recommend the breakfast club OMG my new favorite breakfast. Also the wait staff is amazing and very prompt and polite. Also the man himself a Wally comes around the tables for a little chat. And his Daughter Cathy great host as well. Cathy is all about the customer being happy.  Nice to see a great family buisness cone to Brampton.  Keep up the good work ladies."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place /diner.  Big windows, view of Steeles and truck parking!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a weekday. Seeing that already 10 tables already occupied ,felt it's going to be good. The server greeted us and showed us a table, although busy but still was courteous and polite. It took more than 20 mins for the food after  ordering . Food was hot and good ,fairly priced. Interior is more than average. Service excellent.will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Have visited this restaurant quite frequently since it opened and find it to provide good food at reasonable prices. The owner, Wally and his two children Johnny and Cathy, are friendly and gracious hosts. Found that waitresses Stef and Elaine truly provide that extra level of service and have no hesitation in recommending a patron ask to be seated at one of their tables. As with any restaurant, errors in orders can happen but the few times this has occurred the issue has been promptly corrected with a sincere apology.  A must visit restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"first time here  great breakfast  had sausages   and eggs toast and home fries  lots to eat i will  be back"}
{"text":"Good food and massive portions. The staff was also very friendly but the seating wasn't that cozy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing friendly service and great food I had the shrimp quesadilla and it was out of this world simply the best I've ever had and the fries were hand cut and delicious"}
{"text":"Nice place but overpriced with a mediocre menu and so so food. Silly restrictions such as no salad with the pasta entree seem arbitrary and not the best way to ensure customers return. I'd only recommend it for breakfast. Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5. This is fairly recently opened, and very much a throwback Canadian menu...with modern prices.  The menu features a pretty large all-day breakfast menu, with the usual suspects such as: steak & eggs, benny's, pancakes, etc... Lunch and dinner menus have burgers, chicken fingers, some pasta, roast beef sandwich, and so on. There was even liver and onion on for a lunch special when I was in. I was hoping that the throw-back menu would have throw-back prices, but virtually everything is north of $15 - even the chicken fingers and fries.  I went for the open-faced roast beef sandwich as they said it was from a real roast they cook in-house, and not some processed meat. I think it was about $17-18. The portion was HUGE. The beef was indeed pretty good quality. I went with the mashed potatoes which were okay, but should've went for fries. I tried my friend's fries which were fresh-cut and tasted great. The beef wasn't heated as much as it should've been.  Enough to pique my interest, and would be interested to try the breakfast - but nothing spectacular either and a little pricey."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for breakfast so decided to try this place. Nice ambiance and would certainly return.  Breakfast was a large portion- 3eggs, Home fries (real potatoes) and bacon or sausage or ham with toast for $7.95.  I took a pic of the menu so that I can share what else they serve but forgot to take a pic of my breakfast lol.  Nice place.  The place seemed pretty busy and Waitress seemed friendly.  Will return."}
{"text":"Visited Wally's today out of curiosity.. This is another diner serving typical breakfast items such as omelletes , bennys, sandwiches, etc . for lunch and some stuff for dinner. Well, I liked their coffee. Bathroom was clean.  Again to each his own.. I should not have been lazy on a Saturday morning to just make breakfast at home, we could have enjoyed it more and saved $$ too."}
{"text":"Our first experience with Wally's on Steeles. A decent local Brampton Restaurant that just opened a couple of years ago form what I remember. We stopped by for a Saturday morning Breakfast. Nothing stuck out & nothing was messed up. The only thing I have to say is the breakfast potato's which I asked to be made \"crispy\" (a thing of mine) were delivered only warm to the table. I guess when I asked for crispy & was delivered warm I wasn't clear enough!?  It visit again but for something different."}
{"text":"Kind of pricy and the service is hit and miss...  However the portion size and food presentation is good. Establishment looks nice inside and would recommend this restaurant for business or family lunch."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant with modern decor and 3 TVs playing different channels. They have a lot of choices on their menu.  I had the daily special. Chicken noodle soup, charbroiled chicken on pasta with rosee sauce and rice pudding for $15.95.  The charbroiled chicken was a bit dry and the pasta was soft. The soup and rice pudding were pretty normal. Next time I return, I'd like to try the peameal sandwich, as it sounds great - grilled, fried, stacked peameal bacon topped with hollandaise sauce and peppers. Extra fried egg optional.  No wifi. I asked for the password, waitress said she doesn't think it's public but would find out and never got back to me. Tip: if your wifi isn't public, don't name the network after the store. It took a while to get in and out of the restaurant... was hoping we could've fit this restaurant into a one-hour lunch break."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars based on one visit. Saturday morning breakfast. Bacon and eggs with toast and home fries. Food was excellent and above par. Real home fries not freezer junk. Coffee was above average too.   Service was fast and courteous. The restaurant is new or very recently renovated. In either case it's very nice and comfortable. Your not going to feel like your eating with the strangers at the next table because it's crowded. There are booths and tables are well spaced out.  Prices are average but considering food quality alone, I'd say eating here is a bargain.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Food is not anything special. Ordered steak and eggs, steak was over cooked. Service is okay, not great."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. I love the chicken wings and usually get them when I go here with my family. The waitresses are extremely friendly. One of my new favourite places to go to when going out for dinner in Brampton."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast today. The server came to take our order pretty quick and knew the menu really well. The food came out about 10 mins after we ordered which was good because they were pretty busy (something about a conference in the area). Anyways the potatoes were good, eggs were cooked well too. I didn't really like the ham because I personally don't like ham but the sausages were good. The pancakes were tasty but I feel like when you order a big breakfast meal like with eggs toast ham sausages bacon and french toast/pancakes there should be an option to ask for your french toast/pancakes before or after the eggs. Otherwise something will get cold before you even get to it. In this case my pancakes were cold by the time I got around to them. This is a good looking place inside too. I think it just recently got renovated. You'd think it would just be like wooden chairs and tables inside but they actually look like a legit restaurant with booths inside."}
