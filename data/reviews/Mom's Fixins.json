{"text":"I am a cook so I am real picky about my food. I have had the pork chops and fried chicken both great. The yams and cabbage are my favorite. Put it this way if I want to stop cooking soulfood I could."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service was good. We had 3 different meals in our group with 6 different sides and everything was great. Mom came out and chatted with us. Highly recommend and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The gravy is amazing and the cornbread waffles are unreal! I haven't had a bad plate yet!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last week. I had the veggie sides ( green beans and potatoes and they had absolutely  no seasoning in them and had to return  Collard greens I had to return because  of no seasoning ) but, the cabbage and the black eyed peas were Alright!! My advice is to go and take a lesson from LoLo's and the way Soul Food is suppose to taste!!!  A word of advice. ..put some Soul in the kitchen to cook please!!!! Please!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Barbecue Chicken (White meat), Mixed Greens, & Fried Okra... everything was very tasty, hot and delicious. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. I will for sure return!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that there was a southern style restaurant near me.  Unfortunately the food isn't that good.  I was underwhelmed by the chicken and the sweet potato fries were bland.  Such a bummer!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but too pricey. A meatloaf lunch sandwich is $14.  Half order ribs is $18"}
{"text":"First time and it won't be the last. Hidden gem located in the Surprise. The food is delicious. The portions are good. My waitress Patrina was fantastic with my first experience there. I also met the owner she was very warm and welcoming. She walked around and greeted every table. Her carrot that she recommended was delicious."}
{"text":"Went here to get some Southern food. Being from SC and having a mom as a great cook, I came with great expectation. Ordered the catfish, greens, and fried okra. The catfish was tasteless and the fried okra was from frozen. The greens were ok but had to add salt. Portions were very small but the price was not. Very overpriced for what I got. I was very disappointed. This is a facade for true Southern cooking."}
{"text":"first visit service very slow but friendly ran out of fries slaw not to our liking and very small portion BBQ sandwich very good will give it another try."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!! The chicken is the moistest ice tasted in years. Cornbread waffles are second to none. The baked beans could be a meal unto itself.  Honestly the best comfort in Phoenix.  Mom is a hoot!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant based on the great reviews. I wish I could agree. We were seated and then completely ignored for over 30 minutes, it would have been nice if someone at least brought water. I had to get up and remind the hosts of our presence. When we finally got our food, it was okay but not fabulous."}
{"text":"We had a hard time finding this place - Yelp had the GPS messed up but I'm glad we hung in there...excellent food & service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken/Mac and cheese/baked beans with sweet tea and it was freaking DELISH! Wasn't able to try the HOMEMADE desserts but that's ok just means we have another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and terrific folks.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm from the south and looking forward to a great meal and I wasn't impressed. small portions for being southern food. the greens were bitter."}
{"text":"First off, this place is adorable. Super simple and bright. Very clean and spacious. We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who seated our party of two adults and two kids at a booth. Our server arrived less the minute later to take our drink orders. She was very friendly and addressed our kids directly, which I always appreciate. My husband and I ordered sweet tea and one of my sons ordered lemonade. Per the server, the lemonade is freshly squeezed. The sweet tea was served in small mason jars and was delicious. I am a bit of a sweet tea snob and this stuff was awesome! After delivering the drinks, our server brought us some biscuits and gravy. This was a nice surprise and the biscuits were fresh and buttery. The gravy was a chicken gravy and very tasty. I ordered the fried chicken, all white meat. This came with a chicken breast and a wing. The chicken was juicy but not at all greasy. I had Mac and cheese and candied yams as sides, both were great. My husband had a pork chop which he raved over the flavor and the juiciness. For sides he got French fries which were seasoned steak fries and coleslaw which he enjoyed. My youngest son had the kid's chicken dinner which he chose a drumstick and Mac and cheese. My oldest son had the cheeseburger sliders with fried cabbage. Each meal, including the kids meals, came with a cornbread waffle which was obviously freshly made. None of us were able to finished our meals because we saved room for the banana pudding which... Omg... I am so glad we did! I don't really care for banana desserts but this stuff was delicious. Our server, Chelsea, was very diligent and friendly. She managed to keep our teas filled which was no easy task. She was very patient with my boys who were not exactly on their best behavior. In short, we will definitely be coming back here when we are in the mood for homemade food but not in the mood to cook it ourselves. :)"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and arrived about 5:30. We were seated promptly. Our server was great. The meal was excellent!! The chef even came out after to talk with us about the food. It was more than just a general check in. He discussed with us how the mixed greens were cooked specifically, as my husband grew up in the south, and needless to say the food was spot on! Overall probably the best experience we have had at a restaurant in a long time. The prices were very reasonable too. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good the catfish down to the okra and mashed potatoes!  They needed a spot out here in the west side like this!!!  Awesome spot awesome environment and clean i give it a A++++"}
{"text":"After waiting for one hour for food to arrive (we were seated at 600 pm) and after several questions about status of our order to our food server, meals finally arrived.  The catfish was lukewarm and the sides were cold and had to be taken back to be re-heated.  Seriously???? My hubbie and I got sick with the big D and stomach pains, etc.  The only thing we had in common on our orders was the catfish.  Both of us had to call out sick from work today because of the awful symptoms of food poisoning.   Have been so looking forward to this place opening...the sides were good, though even though they had to be sent back the kitchen. Will be calling them later today to inform them of the problem...cross contamination??? Undercooked fish? Who knows."}
{"text":"Crunchy catfish juicy chicken delicious greens . Can't go wrong if you like soul food. Pork chops are as good as it gets.  Thanks for saving me a drive downtown"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff good place to eat awesome southern style food would come back again and again portions could be a little bit bigger but the food makes up for it must try chicken fried chicken"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular to Yelp, but felt that I had to comment on Mom's Fixins. My wife ordered the cat fish which was excellent. I ordered the Gumbo.  Gumbo should have a dark roux. This was pasty white with no flavor at all. If you took this roux and added Chinese noodles you would have perfect Chow Mein. Gumbo is suppose to have chicken in it. Mine had one small piece of chicken. Gumbo is suppose to have ample amounts of andouille sausage. Mine had no sausage of any kind. Mine had some okra, but not very much. Gumbo is suppose to have some spice and heat. Mine had none.  The biscuit and sausage gravy sample that was served had no sausage in it and again, there was no southern spice or flavor.   The corn bread waffle that was served would be better served with syrup in the AM as a breakfast waffle because there was no corn bread flavor. It tasted like a waffle I would get from the Waffle House.  I think it is a far reach to call my experience Southern Cuisine. I was very disappointed and have been generous to rate it this high. The owners have to decide if they are going to serve true southern cooking or if they are going to pander to those with an extremely mild palate.  The staff are excellent."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. Super customer service! Fast, friendly, and persistent. The server checked on us at appropriate intervals, refilled drinks, etc. Love the place. We will go back. That being said, I do have one criticism...and I say this with love...you have got to find a way to move meals from the kitchen faster. We waited over an hour. True, the meals were perfect...delicious and filling and captured the southern cooking you advertise. But, we are retired. People with kids find it difficult to manage that kind of wait. Younger people on a date won't come back if they can get meals quicker elsewhere. You've got to turn those tables over much quicker. Your business will make more money, servers more tips. And it all starts with getting food out of the kitchen faster."}
{"text":"Very bland food.  Some over-cooked and dry and some under-cooked and hard and tasteless. They can't seem to get it right. You can get better food at almost any other restaurant in the area and at a better price.  Very disappointing.  I will not be going back.  I agree with the other review that called it hospital food."}
{"text":"The hours have now changed.  They are open for lunch Tuesday-Sunday at 11 & close @ 8.  Wonderful food. Mom's meatloaf & mashed potatoes are phenomenal.  They give you biscuits and gravy before your meal.  Biscuits were very light & flavorful & gravy was perfect.  I was worried that the food might be heavily salted, but it wasn't.  Seasoning was perfect.  We also shared her Peach Cobbler.  This woman can cook!  BBQ only Friday-Sunday & her gumbo is only served Sundays.  I'd go back just to try that!  This place is a keeper"}
{"text":"Totally Delish and true southern fried goodness check out the pics it tasted just like mom used to make for Sunday dinner and get the sweet tea that Delany makes!!!"}
{"text":"Food was flavorful and menu was acceptable. Ate there during an hour long lunch and our server's attentiveness was the great. I'll go back again."}
{"text":"The chicken strips were good but I wasn't impressed with the sids and I waited about 45 minutes for my to go order  during off hours."}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected delight.  We recently wandered in after finding that Archies had closed. The front door was open at 10:57 and we entered and took a seat.  Another family, including an older lady in a wheelchair, was also in the waiting area. Immediately a woman came into the waiting area and protested that they were closed and that they invited the other party in because it was hot outside. I prepared to leave the restaurant because I felt unwelcome and as though my presence was an unintended consequence of someone being nice. My husband informed me that the restaurant opened at 11. It was now 10:58. He wanted to stay.   I explained to the woman who was protesting that her reaction was very strong and it made me feel uncomfortable. I felt that the professional response would have been to say that they weren't seating for five more minutes and to offer menus and water.   But we were soon seated and while I was still upset I was able to see that they had food that was paleo friendly.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken, upgraded to white meat, cabbage, and green beans. My husband had the gumbo, available Sundays only.  The server said he would soon return with biscuits and gravy. We had brought drinks in with us so we weren't parched.  The food came out well before the promised biscuits. The portions were modest. But the food was good. It was flavorful and well prepared. The biscuits were delivered with the check. I am told they were delish.   My suggestion to Mom's Fixin's is that they offer an entree that is compromised of four side dishes. Their sides are unusual out here and would likely findable audience.  The woman who was protesting earlier did visit the guests shortly after we were seated and was very nice. I didn't find out if she was an owner or employee."}
{"text":"Happy for good southern food in Surprise. Good service and better food. Hopefully people of Surprise realize there will be things to work out in any new business but it's important to support local. :-)Be proud of your dream, you will be blessed! Side note: loved the descriptions on the menu & the humor. We will be back, want that banana pudding ! Husband wants the chicken fried chicken."}
{"text":"There are a couple of deal breakers for me (aside from bad food and dirty establishments) small restaurants fall into; poor customer service and poor pacing. This place failed in neither area. From beginning to end, the service was outstanding. The kitchen line must be well managed because the pacing between receiving beverages, complimentary appetizer (biscuits & gravy) and the main meal was perfect. They stayed on top of drink refills and table clearing as they were watchful for when guests were in need of more drinks and /or finished with a plate. They also ask without assuming before removing the plate. We went towards the end of the day and had pork chops with gravy, fried catfish, fried chicken, black eyed peas, yams, macaroni and cheese, fried okra and sweet potato pie. The macaroni and cheese and black eye peas could have stood for a tad more seasoning but nothing to deter me from this little West Valley gem. Many restaurants try to stretch frying grease and don't properly change it which causes fried items to taste old and rancid like the grease they were cooked in. Not this place. The place was neat and clean throughout. It is clear the owner takes pride in everything that goes on there and holds every employee to a high standard and accountable for the success of the business. That's the kind of thing that keeps patrons coming back. I will be a regular here, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Mom's Fixins, it was great. Wait staff very attentive, especially Mark our bartender. Recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some great Southern Cooking."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic southern food restaurant! Great staff, delicious food, and very nice environment. I've pretty much tried the entire menu, and I've not once been disappointed!"}
{"text":"These guys really need to advertise they have a full and quite frankly beautiful bar with 6 beers on tap and as many in bottle. Food was great. Restaurant was much more upscale than I anticipated. Outdoor space facing north as well. Clean clean clean!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Mom's Fixins , and will definitely be back.  I had the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and fried cabbage.  My husband had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and fried okra.  We both enjoyed our meals and were only disappointed that  the bbq isn't available all week.  We'll be back :)   Banana pudding was amazing and presented beautifully in a Mason jar.  Definitely give this place a try.  The food and service are both wonderful!"}
{"text":"Soooooo DELICIOUS!!! Highly, highly recommended!! Bringing the whole family back! Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"We went here and waited for an hour and a half to get food. A good portion of that time was just waiting for water. the service was sub-par at best. Worst part is, the food wasn't even worth the wait. I had the Bacon Shredded pork burger and it was good, sure, but we were ordering the fried chicken and paid the extra $1.50 for white meat, but we got some dark meat. The food was average, the service was really bad. One of the waiters weirdly whispered to me to scoot in for her move. Then, another waiter said \"Sorry about that. She a creep.\""}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place I would highly recommend it. I had the ribs with a side of Candied Yams and Mac N Cheese. My meal also came with a waffle cornbread. Everything was outstanding and the food came out HOT as food should from a restaurant should. Our server Tamara was attentive, friendly, and knew her menu. While eating a manager was out checking in with the guests on their food and service. Thank you for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Get place to eat ppl was friendly. I'm from the south so it's hard to find that Southern cooking. Food was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We love to support local businesses, and enjoy returning here whenever we can. They will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"If the southern cooking I grew up on was this good I'd have fonder childhood memories. The Biscuits and gravy served as an appetizer caused me to actually like biscuits and gravy. The mixed greens were by far the best I've ever had and the black eye peas were better than my Granny's.  The fried chicken,  the fried chicken was absolutely amazing if not sensational. The meal came with a cornbread waffle that was so delicious and nothing short of genius. I usually don't get fanatical about a meal but I fell in love with the fried chicken dinner. Best meal I've had since a year ago in Vegas.  I dismissed this place twice while searching for dinner with my wife but now we'll be going back a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Good food, just a little slow. Seems like they have a few kinks to work out as far as service is concerned but overall a really good place. Pulled pork was the best!"}
{"text":"Food was just Ok.  Lived in Atlanta for 20 years and while the menu contains items you would find on a southern menu, this is just not real southern cooking.  Cornbread waffle was soggy and disgusting.  Service was poor.  Not a repeater for someone who wanted REAL southern food."}
{"text":"This place is legit.. I felt like I was going to my grandmas house where home cooking is what's for dinner.. The fried cat fish was on point no fishy smell like those other joints battered perfectly grandmas way with cornmeal .. no fluffy beer batter where you take most of it off. The corn bread waffle was light and airy not like the other soul food joint where the waffle is a floppy frisbee.  So many homemade desserts, all fabulous... I could tell owners put their heart and soul in every dish... Best soul food this side of Louisiana.. one visit and you are hooked..."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! A lil surprise in Surprise!!! I highly recommend the catfish with fried cabbage and green beans!!!"}
{"text":"Eight months ago, I gave this five stars. Went here last night, on a Friday. Only one person in dining area, two men at the bar. Very surprising as we know their food is very good. We ordered ice tea and then received the menus. That's when it dawned on us why they were so empty. New menus with with new overinflated prices. If their portions were larger it might be worth staying but they were charging $13 for two pieces of chicken and two sides. Pulled pork sandwich with bacon, $15 or $16. We didn't order but paid for our two small very weak teas, nearly $7. Also, all new faces, .....again. We've been in about five or six times. Consistent friendly waitresses only the first two times. I'm guessing they won't be here long. It's too bad because the food is good but for the price, it better come served with gold silverware. Also, we weren't offered the complimentary biscuit and gravy. Maybe they don't have it anymore. We will be crossing this off our list of places to dine."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during work. Order came up quick and everything tasted great. The staff is on top of their game here. I will be coming back from lunch again."}
{"text":"You will want to stop in for some southern comfort food here in the Northwest Valley. This has been a weekend favorite for a few years now. Today I ordered the lunch special a shrimp and catfish basket.- 6 large shrimp and a catfish fillet. It was large enough to share , which I did and walked out with my belly full.  The place is clean and welcoming. The wait staff is very helpful and informed us of additional wait times for fried chicken. She also was helpful with answering questions about ingredients (nut allergy). Next time I'm going to order cake first!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went for a Sunday drive and were looking for something a little different.  Checked Yelp and saw Mom's with a solid 4 star rating, had to try it.  It was a nice place, clean and welcoming.  Service       and food also good for the most part.  Wife orders a chicken salad and I ordered the weekend   BBQ chicken special.  The special comes with two sides and mine were 5 star flavor wise!  But it stops there, for $14 I got 2 very small pieces of chicken smothered I the same BBQ sauce I have in my home icebox, and I mean pigeon size.  Their cornbread was served like a waffle but totally lacked flavor or that cornbread texture.   Bottom line, I loved those sides of fried cabbage and yams!!  But for a check of over $27 I wouldn't put this on my list of dining destinations."}
{"text":"I only put one star because the bus boy was the ONLY positive. He deserved five stars... But the rest left a lot to be desired. I could have received better fried chicken at KFC (which just makes me shudder), than what I was served (note, they should also put in the menu that it will take at least 15 minutes to prepare because it's \"made fresh\". I'm not even going to mention the mashed potatoes because there is nothing positive to say and the country green beans...Um yeah no!  My husband had the meatloaf and said that he would rather have the Stouffer's or Boston Market frozen TV dinner... Better flavors! If you are looking for county atmosphere or any atmosphere this is not the place to go. Between? the prices being way to high for the quality/quantity and the horrible service... Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The chicken was crispy but could use a bit more seasoning however the addition of hot sauce took care of that. I loved the fried cabbage & the mac wasn't baked how I like it but still tasted pretty decent. I enjoyed the old school r&b music playing in the background and the atmosphere was great. The staff were also really friendly & the establishment was clean and well kept. All and all I would go again and try a few more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Scrolling through the Hot New Businesses section of Yelp looking for that up and coming place to grab a bite to eat today when I came across Mom's Fixin's.  The restaurant itself is tucked away in the far northwest valley, open layout with a nice size patio for those gorgeous spring/fall evenings.  Don't come expecting breakfast foods, this kitchen doesn't open until 11am however, they tease you with a complimentary treat of biscuits and gravy that are phenomenal.   This visit the wife tried the Fried Chicken/Mac n Cheese & Baked Beans. The chicken was super moist and seasoned well w/o the thick, floury, batter coating.  The mac n cheese was a little pot of gold goodness and the baked beans were like no other, just a little kick to remind you of the South.  I had the hot links, never tried 'em...EVER, ANYWHERE so I don't know how to comment on them but they were good...not my favorite item but good nonetheless.  I suggest using the waffle cornbread to turn them into a sandwich LOL."}
{"text":"If you love comfort food, then you are in for a treat.  Mom's  kitchen exceeds all expectations.  I love the way she presents her food.  That ole southern style is right on the mark.  My husband and I love the choice from the Menu.  We try and eat there at least once a week, especially on Sunday's.   I hope that we can continue to patronize Mom\"s Kitchen, because we need this type of Restaurant in our neighborhood.  It makes my life easy, when I can't get it together for dinner, then my Husband heads for Mom's.   Thanks for coming to our area.  Oh yeah, let's not forget the Homemade Cakes and pies.  The desserts are absolutely out of this world,  you have to try the Banana pudding.  Not to mention German Chocolate Cake!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Sad they don't do the biscuits and gravy anymore when you first get seated"}
{"text":"One and done the food was really bad it was so bad that as soon as I left my stomach was hurting really bad the Mac cheese was very runny the yams where not fresh and the prices are very high for the amount of food you get I'm. Really confused charging to use your credit card I have never seen this before"}
{"text":"Good portions and the food was great. Staff was friendly and she kept the drinks refilled.   Only dish I wasn't impressed with was the gumbo. I was surprised at the portion size and I grew tired of eating it after a while. Not worth the 19$."}
{"text":"Delicious Vegetarian meal options!   If you don't eat meat, you'll be in Hog Heaven at Mom's Fixins.  The  'Southern' cooking slogan.... it is AUTHENTIC.   And I'm a Texas girl, so know what I'm talkin about.  They start you off with free biscuits which are perfect.  We ordered the Sweet Peas, Candied Yams, Fabulous Mac n Cheese, fried okra and House salad - and between the two of us we couldn't finish it all!!  Even so, after that spectacular lunch, we split the peach cobbler, which was equally wonderful.   Service was Southern Friendly and kind.  This place is a must stop!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp, searching for fried chicken on our trip from Southern, CA to Phoenix.   It's in a nice area and Yelp directions helped us to locate them.   It looks kind new and is nicely decorated.    We arrived at 7Pm on a Friday night ( they close at 8pm ).  They were busy, but had a few tables open. I wasn't super hungry; they let me order from the kid's menu which was perfect as we had room for dessert.  We both had fried chicken with the cornmeal waffle (yum).  For our sides, we had fried cabbage, greens, and mashed potatoes with gravy.  Everything was very good, but my husband wished the gravy had been thicker.  The fried cabbage (pan fried?) is so delicious!  We also loved the sweet tea!    The staff was very sweet.  It was a few minutes before closing time when we ordered the banana pudding ( very yummy ) and we were told to \"take our time and enjoy it.\"   We enjoyed watching the Winter Olympics while listening to the background music which was played low enough that we could enjoy a conversation.   A nice evening."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just writing this review. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and have yet to be disappointed! Mom's fixins customer for life!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I had chicken fried chicken, mashed potatoes and green beans. Finished with some banana pudding. So good!"}
{"text":"Am amazed at all the 5 stars, but good for them. I was raised on real southern cooking. My mom, aunts and grandma made unbelievable meals everyday. I won't be back, because the price is very high, for two pieces of chicken, the mashed potatoes where chopped potatoes in water, no flavor, the greens were like eating dirt, nasty. Not much choice in wine or beer, the price was high as 90% or restaurant's are around here. The fried chicken was the best part of the meal, but 2 tiny pieces for $10.50. The décor was odd for a what I thought would be a good  old fashioned down home type place, seemed a mix of half class, and I don't know what? I think the owners need to visit real down home type southern places, and I have been to many. I come from an area where there are a lot of southern cooking places. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today and I'm not sure I would go back. I got the chicken fried chicken with Mac and cheese and butter corn as my sides. Also tried the coleslaw and a house salad. To start, the house salad had what seemed like old lettuce in it (lettuce was brown), and the homemade ranch was very watered down. The coleslaw was different and had tomato and onion in it, not bad I'm just not an onion fan. The chicken fried chicken was very bland. The chicken wasn't crispy at all, it didn't even seem like it was actually fried, and I love chicken fried chicken, one of my favorite things. It could definitely have used some more seasoning, even the gravy wasn't that good. The mac n cheese was good but I have definitely had better, again was very bland in taste. The butter corn I would say was probably the worst. The little dish it was served in was full of water, not butter, water. I guess I would have expected my butter corn to taste like butter and not be drowned in water. The restaurant was very slow when we went which was around 530pm. You would think they would be busy then. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I and another couple went to this restaurant after finding out another restaurant that we had purchased a Groupon for falsely advertise their hours and they were closed for cleaning without any notification. We had heard that this was A comfort style type of menu with home cooked meal's so we were eager to try it. To put it bluntly the food was OK, mag gumbo which advertised full of chicken and sausage had one sliver of sausage cut in half and I honestly believe it might've been Campbell's chunky soup poured over rice. We ordered salads prior to the meal which did not arrive till after our entrées came. We had to ask for the cornbread that supposedly came with the meal and with an attitude from our server, it was finally delivered. Our server acted like we were inconveniencing her. The menu was tolerable but the worst thing about this restaurant was their lack of training and professionalism with their servers and staff. Plates were piling up on the table and we finally asked someone going by if they can remove them because of lack of table space. Unfortunately, The food alone was not enough to make me want to come back and put up with horrible service! Until they get their act together I highly do not recommend patronizing this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this restaurant bc of its reviews. The staff is very welcoming with outstanding service. Food presentation was very nice and we were served in a timely manner. I wish I could give this place 5 stars bc the staff and cleanliness was just that great! But, the food was very small proportions, bland, and way overpriced. Mashed  potatoes were the size of an ice cream scoop, very bland. The chicken fried chicken was tasteless and soft, not crispy, nor tender. My daughter's grilled chicken was dry and bland, she asked if ok she doesn't eat it all. Son's hamburger was average flavor he said, but hungry enough to finish it. I won't be bringing my family back for a meal, just not worth it."}
{"text":"Best Fried catfish in the state of Arizona!"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here because I was really craving southern food but I came away a bit disappointed. The fried chicken and BBQ ribs were both mediocre. I probably would've been better off getting fried chicken at a nearby fast food chain (and for a quarter of the price). The sides were great though, if I had to eat there again, I would probably only order sides, the mixed greens, fried cabbage, and okra were all delicious."}
{"text":"Grand Opening!!!  They have some work to do!  It has a lot of promise... We got our food almost an our after ordering it (catfish).  The sides were cool by then.  Kitchen staff needs to learn how to pace.  Once they have to timing and pacing , it will be a place to revisit...and give more \"stars.\"  BUT, cleanliness is an issue.  Both my wife an I got sick after eating there.  We had nothing else to eat that night, and we experienced distress at about the same time.  Because it was mild, I believe that it was a matter of cross-contamination, not tainted food.  Since this is the first weekend they are open, I think they only have a day or two to get it all together."}
{"text":"They opened today so expect a few growing pains. That said, the food was great and the prices even better! I don't eat much so being able to order meals a-la-carte without the sides is huge for me, while my husband still got his big meal with sides. The food was great, and the biscuits and gravy before the meal was good as well. Definitely worth a try, but except a few small hiccups the first week as they get established. It's worth it for the food and the prices"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I really wanted this place to be great. Coming from the South I miss good Southern food. But, being from the South I know when food isn't what it should be. The \"four cheese\" Mac and cheese tasted exactly like Kraft Mac and cheese, with the cheap powdered cheese. The rest of the food definitely had a pre-packaged, out of a can or box taste and it definitely didn't have a taste of homemade. And, to top it all off, as we were eating or food we noticed that all of the small serving bowls still had the barcode stickers on them, all were completely dry and  had never seen water. So, all of the food was being served in something that had never once been washed, since it left the manufacturer. So, needless to say, this was a one and done kinda place for us. Eatf you know real Southern food, keep looking unfortunately."}
{"text":"poor service - quality of food just so-so - too much coating on everything.  The food is a heart attack waiting to happen"}
{"text":"Visiting with my aunt we were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat. Found this place and are very very happy we came in. The staff was great the decor is very nice. In our meals were excellent we split the meatloaf and the rotisserie chicken coleslaw was great sweet potato fries very good and the black eyed peas and complimentary biscuit and gravy are all a winner. We will be back"}
{"text":"The food was great large portions good prices and the dessert was amazing can't wait to come back and try other things on menu it was so yummy wish I would have taken a picture for you all next I will come check them out"}
{"text":"We went yesterday to take my Mother-In-Law for her birthday!  The food was amazing, great atmosphere and the staff was really friendly.  Loved the fact that \"Mom\" actually came out of the kitchen to chat with us.  The fried shrimp was delic along with the carrot cake.  Can't wait to go back and try the shrimp and grits"}
{"text":"I am skeptical of any restaurant in Surprise.  How ever , I love southern food and it's up the street from my office, so I gave it a chance.  So glad I did, I am hooked and can't wait  to  try out the whole menu. The biscuits and gravy were spot on. I could of eaten them as a main course. They are a free appetizer with your meal. I ordered the fried chicken ....wow. Fresh, not frozen perfectly breaded and deep fried to a nice golden crisp. The chicken was very light and not greasy one bit. I chose the greens and black eyed peas for my sides. A nice combo of greens with perfect flavor. The black eyed peas were nicely cooked. not undercooked and very tasty. I also  had a  cornbread waffle as a side. .  Once again, perfect , could've eaten 3 of them. The server was very attentive, and friendly and my water glass was never empty. The inside of the restaurant was very clean and inviting. Really have no complaints with this place... Well, one ... I wish they stayed open later than eight."}
{"text":"We had the fried chicken,  mashed potatoes,  corn bread,  mac and cheese.   Topped it off with peach cobbler and it was all amazing."}
{"text":"All I have to say is Wow! Outstanding! The ribs were fantastic, plenty of meat and flavored to perfection. And the sides, the cabbage and Mac n Cheese were out of this world. My wife had the pulled pork over a homemade jalepeno and bacon cornbread waffle.. and last but not least was the incredible Banana bread pudding in a small mason jar! Can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Recently opened so had to try it out.  The meatloaf and fried cabbage were awesome!  Love the biscuits and gravy being served instead of the standard bread/rolls at other places.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Had the BBQ bacon burger  it was great going back for more . the wife had the fried chicken  good southern hood. Sweet tea just like home . And the owner is a Miami Dolphins fan."}
{"text":"Tried the fried chicken based on other reviews and it was great! The entire staff was attentive. We went for lunch and it seemed like there was a steady business which the servers seemed to handle it well. The sides were as good as the main dishes. The green beans and waffles were very tasty. I'll definitely"}
{"text":"Wow.  Great Chicken Fried Chicken. Homemade mashed potatoes and the waffle corn bread. Seriously I hope this family enjoys this enough to keep doing what they are doing. Great job and thanks for the good food."}
{"text":"I'm from Georgia was born in Tennessee I have had lots of good southern cooking. This place is only average  for a Southern restaurant. Meatloaf was a little bland and the sauce on it wasn't good.   Fried Chicken was a little too done but OK.  At $3.80 all a cart the vegetables were not worth the price.  Green beans and some pepper or something in them that made them taste spicy.  Black IEyed peas  and cabbage we're both very good.  Cornbread was only OK."}
{"text":"My first time visit was the Perfect example of 5 star experience in what dinning out is all about. Service was outstanding, food was outstanding, Prices were very affordable. Clean with a great atmosphere. I HIGHLY Rate this place for everyone to try. You will experience true quality."}
{"text":"I eat here several times a week. As a wee lad I lived in Arkansas and this food is the real deal with the exception of the conspicuous absence of fried pies. Mom assures me they may make an appearance one day. The Banana Pudding is the best you will get out this way and the cake of the day is usually well worth having. Word of mouth seems to be keeping the place busy hopefully it will be here for quite awhile. It's not the easiest place to spot but worth the effort."}
{"text":"The best was the gravy for the biscuits. Delicious. The food was nice and hot, fried okra and onion rings perfect. Meatloaf good but chicken disappointing. No returns here."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  Stumbled upon it while on a road trip to the area, and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing authentic southern cooking and incredible waffles.  Our waiter was very nice and it seemed like a nice genuine family run business."}
{"text":"Was actually on my way to have mexican and saw the sign , made a u-turn. Glad I did! I had the chicken fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy and the cornbread waffle. All very flavorful and the chicken was seasoned to perfection and moist. I am looking forward to trying the BBQ and different sides next time, which looked amazing as well. Mom and her staff were all very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that Moms Fixins is a Fantastic addition to the westside. We have visited Moms several times and the food is always perfect!  I'm excited to try the ribs but we can never seem to make it there on the weekends."}
{"text":"Two of my coworkers and myself went to Mom's Fixins on our lunch break. We had a little over an hour available to be out of clinic. We arrived and it took about 5 minutes to be seated, with only one other (large) party seated in the restaurant. The host was friendly and seated us in a booth. We ordered drinks about 10 minutes later, and it took another 5 to receive them and to place our lunch orders. We did notice only one server and one host-that was the entirety of the front of house staff. After placing our orders, we waited about 35 minutes before apologizing to the server and telling her we needed to get back to work. At no point in the 35 minute wait were we told that our food was being prepared or thank you for your patience. We were pretty disappointed in wait time and service, today, however we do want to give this place another shot. The menu looks excellent and the decor is great. We understand that sometimes more guests come in than are expected, but having only two people working front of house is just unreasonable. Hopefully the owners/management see this is flawed, and hire some more employees to make lunch go more smoothly."}
{"text":"Just went tonight some was good, some ok some not great, I had the fried chicken it was good not great and you only get two pieces a leg and thigh for $10.50 with two sides and a small piece corn bread waffle which is not good, I wanted 3 pieces of chicken and the charge was $2.50 for a thigh the sides were just ok my wife's mashed potatoes were cold and were replaced, free biscuits were average at best. Service was just ok. Had to ask for ice tea refill even though glass was sitting empty for 15 minutes. Might go back for lunch but not likely. They have ribs but only on weekends. Why? Did not have desert so can't comment on that. Would have given 2 and a half stars if I had the option!"}
{"text":"Love the biscuits and gravy to start off the meal. The various choices of sides are great. The sever while nice, was a bit slow considering the place was not busy. I knew the food would be good with Mom's recipes coming from Arkansas. The music however does not go with the jazz theme of the decor. I'd suggest changing the music to some Preservation Hall  New Orleans jazz. #WPS"}
{"text":"This is a pleasant down home cook'n Restaurant...food is good and waiter was great very attentive"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here and can say enough about good it was! Mom was there taking orders and making sure everyone had a great meal.   Want to feel like your eating you moms food? Stop by and try this place"}
{"text":"I came to this place around a month ago with a friend who was eager to try it because of its reviews. Both of us left disappointed. The only reason why I gave two stars is because the staff was friendly enough and the waffles and corn bread were decent. Why the rating? The chicken was utter garbage. It tasted as if it was freezer burned or even rotten? It smelled horrible and tasted even worse. I tried a few different condiments to mask the taste and it didn't help at all. The sides were decent and nothing really stands out to really say. At the time of my visit, there was no one inside (A Friday at 3pm ish). I only saw two people come in, in a span of 30 minutes for to-go orders pick-ups."}
{"text":"Incredible food! I lived in the south for several years and Mom's Fixin's is among the best of Southern food I've ever enjoyed. My girlfriend and I shared the pulled pork burger (OMG), collars greens, baked beans (to die for), the jalapeño and bacon cornbread waffle (wow)... truly a great, great place. We got a chance to meet and speak with the owner (Coretta). Awesome woman, wonderful life outlook. Truly a wonderful family run business. I wish we lived close by.   Btw: ask for the server, \"Lucy\".  She's a rock star."}
{"text":"The place is very clean, staff is courteous. The fried chicken and ribs are exceptional. A little pricey but worth it. Will recommend and come back again to try out the meatloaf and cat fish."}
{"text":"Wow! We are blown away at how good Mom's Fixins was on our recent visit! Such a simple concept but so many times has gone so horribly wrong. Mom's Fixins though--they get it RIGHT. I have never in my life had green beans as good as they are at Moms. My son had the ribs--and he is a barbecue fanatic. He said these were the best he's ever had. Even my tough to please Father In Law said he would be back! I had the chicken tenders with buttered corn and green beans. Amazing. I can't wait to come back and have the gumbo. They even have real sweet tea. Service is friendly and quick. Very happy with our experience. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a find, thank you Andrea Robinson for the spotlight.  Right out of the gate this place was impressive, the young hostess who greeted us was genuinely friendly and greeted us warmly, as well as giving us mulitiple seating options.    I had the sampler plate (fried catfish, okra, pulled pork slider and chicken tenders).  The slider was OK, but everything else was amazing!  My wife said the okra was the best she had eaten, my son wolfed down his order of chicken tenders (I promise you have not had anything like these chicken tenders) and I would order the catfish anytime I can get it.  My wife ordered the fried chicken and was very happy with her choice.  The only small let down were the mashed potatoes, very bland and weirdly wet/mushy).  Chicken gravy however was wonderful.   We had the banana pudding (GREAT!) but I will look forward to the chance to try the sweet potato pie next time.  My wife made it clear that we will return until we have a chance to try everything on the menu.  Can't say more than that."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. The food is excellent, especially the cat fish, and the wait staff is so kind and attentive to what you want and how you want it. The bathrooms are clean, the entertainment the large television(s) provide is a plus if there is a slow spot in conversation. Try it, you might like it."}
{"text":"Second time coming here today, and it was just as amazing as the first time I went. Food is outstanding! I think of the candied yams all the time. The meatloaf was great, very moist. Fried chicken was great too. Can't wait to come back already! Service is great too. Although, my friend heard one of the waitresses talking smack about the owner when she was being called. That rubbed me off the wrong way. But other than that, food was incredible!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had a good southern cooked meal in a while this place is amazing. Great corn bread, biscuits and gravy is very good. Must try this place!"}
{"text":"As we were on our way to the local Tennis facility in Surprise, both my wife and I were once again faced with the quandary of what to have for dinner.  She pulled out her trusty yelp app, and found us this gem of a restaurant on Bell Road, right off the 303.  This establishment is located within a cluster of other restaurants on the North side of Bell Road and 152nd avenue.  Although Surprise is not often know for its extensive cuisine offerings, we were really looking forward to partaking of some Southern cooking. A quick perusal of the Yelp reviews yielded generally good (4 star reviews).  So, here we were, trying to decide what would provide the best overall sampling of their offerings. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with Fried Cabbage and Okra. I love okra, and always choose it as a side whenever the opportunity presents itself.  My wife ordered the Fried Pork chop, along with the Mixed Greens, and the Yams.  When our food arrived, the first thing we noticed was that our meat selections were lightly breaded, with no overflow of grease. Now to some, this may be an affront as I know that some prefer an overly greased Southern dishes.  However, that was not our preference, and the overall presentation of our food was wonderful.  Speaking of wonderful, the spices they used in their cookery added a great dimension to the meal.  The Pork Chop and the Chicken that we were impressive in both their texture and flavor, and the accompanying vegetables were prepared just right.  Overall, Mom's Fixins provided a wonderful and delicious introduction to Southern Cooking, and pretty much seals the fact that we will be returning should be find ourselves in this area, once again!"}
{"text":"The food is bland, except for the fish. The portions are small and the mac and cheese is obviously stretched to accommodate the numbers. The German chocolate cake was too moist on my last visit, indicating that it wasn't baked fully. The slice was also noticeably smaller than usual. I am disappointed because I had hoped we could get some nice southern cooking in the area. You cannot start out with a quality product and drop your standards to make money. This place will not last."}
{"text":"Because my parents are from Texas, I KNOW southern food. I'm not saying I'm not a fan, but I'm not saying I am, either.  We visited for my husbands birthday. I don't cook southern so I thought this would be a nice treat for him.  We were greeted promptly as we walked in. We were seated in a spacious, clean dining area. The decor is pretty sparse, but let's be honest, I didn't come for the curtains, ya know? I read on Yelp that the owner of Mom's Fixins is from Arkansas. In order to make the diner feel more at Mom's house, maybe some pics of Arkansas and the south to engage the diner and make it feel more \"homey\". I know they just opened. Ambiance can be added later.  Let's talk about the food, shall we? Yum!  Our order was taken promptly by a friendly server.  About 8 minutes into our wait, these little biscuit bites slathered (and I mean slathered) in butter were brought to our table along with a little crock of sausage gravy. The biscuits were delicious even without the butter, I would imagine. The gravy was a little thinner than what I'm used to but was delicious nonetheless.  My husband commented how delicious his iced tea was. I had water. They were served in 12 oz mason jars. Cute, but I can see the servers running themselves ragged getting refills with such small glasses.  Our meals arrived within a reasonable amount of time. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his fried chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy and corn. He said the corn had a lot of pepper and tasted like he could have made it! The cornbread waffles were amazing. Seriously!!!!! I had the fried catfish which was perfect!! Not too fishy, not too muddy. Trust me, you'll know what mud tastes like if you get bad catfish. Blech! My tarter sauce to fish ratio was WAY off. The tablespoon of tarter lasted about 5 bites into the 2 large pieces of fish. I ordered the green beans as one of my sides. They were identical to the way my mom makes them. Little pieces of bacon and potato just chillin' with the beans.  The macaroni & cheese was so damn delicious I'm pretty sure I made grunting noises while eating!  Did I mention the delicious, crispy, flavorful cornbread waffle that came with the meal?!?! The only thing I would have changed about my entree is adding hush puppies with the fish. For us southerners, catfish is hard to eat without hush puppies.  We did order the peach cobbler for birthday dessert. I honestly wasn't impressed. There was a lot of nutmeg, which, I feel, overpowered the flavor of the peaches but was presented in the most adorable little crock!  I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves southern cooking or anyone who is curious about what true southern cooking has to offer!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Awesome , thanks for a great experience!  I loved everything but I got my fried okra fix and was very happy . Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"First time here. We all ordered fried chicken and it was really good.  Cooked perfectly seasoned very nicely.  Fried cabbage was amazing! Potatoe salad was excellent, mac cheese creamy and tasty. Server was just ok but hostess and busboy were great.  Chef came out to check in. Over all really good meal. We will be back to try other menu items soon."}
{"text":"We just returned from the restaurant tonight.  First off, I'm giving this 5 stars because the food was wonderful (and really, that's 95% of what you should be rating a restaurant on) and the service staff was incredibly attentive but not annoyingly so that it interrupted your experience.  I do have some suggestions that I'll get to in a second - but first, the food!    The meal started with a free appetizer of biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were wonderful and not overly floured or dense - they were quite airy for a biscuit and tasted homemade.  The gravy was also delicious - it was not gloopy/lumpy and didn't get that \"film\" that appears when it's been sitting around too long - i.e. it was fresh.  there were bits of sausage in it as well that really added a nice dose of the south (I hope they are some day able to expand to offering breakfast with biscuits and gravy this good.)  My wife and I both dined tonight, she had meatloaf with fried cabbage and green beans and I had fried chicken (paid the $1 extra to get the white meat) with macaroni and greens.  We're both from Florida and miss this food dearly as it's certainly in short supply out here.  The chicken pieces were quite large, had a wonderful batter, and the meat was not dry at all.  My wife is incredibly picky about meatloaf but absolutely loved it.  It's much chunkier than meatloaf you'll find at most restaurants but that's simply because they don't overdo the bread crumbs in the recipe.  I will say that I would actually order the meat loaf myself (and I generally do NOT like meat loaf at all because it always has too much bread added to the mix).    The sides are really the star of the show here, my greens were sensational, they weren't of the \"canned spinach\" consistency that some places fall victim to - nor were they undercooked.  They were juuuuust right!  My wife was not overly fond of the green beans but I on the other hand loved them as that had that faintly sweet and smoky taste and included bits of onion to compliment the beans.  We were similarly divisive (albeit in reversed roles) with the fried cabbage as she loved it but it just wasn't for me - different tastes is all that boiled down to, there was nothing wrong with it, and again, the wife loved it and would get it again in a heart beat.  Oh, and last but not least, the macaroni and cheese, if they ever get around to catering, we both agreed that we could see ourselves ordering a tray of this magical blend of pasta and cheese.  It's been a long time since either of us have had macaroni and cheese that is done that well.  The menu states that it's a 5 cheese blend - I can only say it was utterly and insanely delicious.  It did taste oven baked but at the same time the pasta wasn't complete mush like what happens.  Regardless of how it was made, just wonderful all around.    We did end our meal by sharing a banana pudding and I do believe the wife would have eaten the entire thing by herself had I stepped away for even a minute or two.  One thing you'll notice right off the bat if you order it is that the pudding isn't the dyed yellow pudding you see in stores.  it's the real-deal with vanilla wafers that aren't stale and mush.  It was the perfect compliment to a wonderful meal.  I believe they serve it in the jar it comes in so they don't have patrons licking the surface clean.  I'm eager to try the sweet potato pie next time (the wife is looking forward to peach cobbler).  Now, that I've had a chance to go over the food I wanted to mention a few other things that I've seen some folks point out on here.  First off, please, please, PLEASE,  pay attention to the hours the dining room is open before you come out here hoping to dine-in as this is a restaurant you should want to see thriving in Surprise (otherwise known as the land of chain restaurants).  They have limited dining room hours and do take-out only for a good chunk of the day.  For instance today they were open from 11a-4pm for take-out only and then 4p-8p for dine-in.  We had actually come by for lunch earlier and had to leave since it wasn't open for dining yet.   Another suggestion I would have (if any of the restaurant staff happens to read this) is that you add a menu option that maybe offers 4 sides as your meal (yes, your sides are that amazing).  I know there is the option to order individual sides, but much like the reduced price you get by ordering a \"meal\" that includes the two sides I think you could do fairly well adding a menu option that gives you your choice of 4 sides for maybe $12.    Finally, towards the end of our meal the owner came out and walked around and greeted everybody except for us lol (we were sitting on the backside of a large 6 top and she just got distracted by the interaction with that table - no offense taken!).  But had she stopped by our table I would have gladly given a hug back (she certainly gives them out) for the wonderful food you've brought to our very own backyard.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We felt like we were eating at a long lost families house in the south.You start your meal with complimentary homemade biscuits with sausage gravy , awesome!! Anything you order is cooked with love . I got the chicken fried chixken with fried cabbage and mac and cheese, very good,.Interior is so nice , nice bar , and very nice patio.Kid friendly , the menu specials are certain days.Our server Josh was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. We can tell that's it's homemade southern food and not pre-packaged. I like the decor. The main problem is a limited menu, but I understand that's for economical reasons.  It's something different from most American restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was superb.  Service is still finding its way but have patience and you'll be rewarded.   Serious contender to LoLo's."}
{"text":"When we drove in to the parking lot, there were not many cars, i will admit i was sceptical. I am no longer a sceptic. This place serves food that really does taste like mama's cooking! It took a bit to get our food, but after an appetizer of gravy and biscuits  (a no charge appetizer, btw) a wait was a good thing! I must also add that after we arrived, so did many others. This is a must for those who love down home cooked meals!"}
{"text":"This food is so delicious! I never write reviews on Yelp but I just had to let the people know how flavorful this food is! I got the Catfish dinner with a side of macaroni and cheese, and mixed collard greens. The staff is great and the owner even came out to welcome me to the restaurant being it was my first time there. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for tasty soul food that's full of flavor and cooked with love!"}
{"text":"I don't think we'll be going to mom's fixin's any time soon....I'm very disappointed with the quality of service and food this time..it was like the waitress was on a different planet or something..I actually had to get up and ask the hostess to have our waitress bring more ice tea...to make it worse we were the only ones in the place, it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon and it was dead as a door nail in there, so why can't you get descent service at that time of day....I ordered a pork chop and it came deep fried..no where on the menu did it say fried pork chop...hum patron beware I guess everything here is fried....at least it's obvious the chicken fried chicken on the menu is fried. lol to top it all off the waitress gave me a pen to sign the charge receipt and it was out of ink. lmao oh ya did I mention they like to serve the ice tea in tiny little ball jars, wth is up with that!"}
{"text":"I am actually surprised at all the high ratings. My quest to find some great fried chicken is still continuing. This location is at the old Marley's, which was a great restaurant. I waited for a couple of months before we tried them. Wanted them to have some time to work out some issues if there were any.  Everyone was very nice, greeted us, sat us and explained their food are made fresh, so be a little patient. Wife and I ordered the fried chicken, with mashed potatoes. I also had onion rings, and wife had the mac and cheese. Wife really enjoyed the mac and cheese. Other then that, the food was OK, not that great. Chicken was fine, but have had much better elsewhere, but not in Arizona yet. Onion rings are fine, Dillons are better. They did give us a complimentary biscuit and gravy to try. Again, they were good but have had better in town. I had a side of BBQ sauce for my onion rings and really liked that, so I am planning to come back for some BBQ. There are other items we would like to try so we will be back. But was it a disappointment? Yes! I like soul food, my favorite restaurant back in Compton is a soul food place. So I was expecting the chicken to be much better. Does not compare to back at my old stomping grounds."}
{"text":"It is so peaceful, loving, caring and very professional staff! I love Arkansas down home food with a southern hospitality tastes. I know from experience that when you can walk in a restaurant and immediately feel good with communicating to the staff-Awesome!   The food on the menu looked good and what I purchased was so good I just did not want to put the food down! \"Give me more! The soul country down home food was awesome!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and like it. We've always found the staff to be friendly and the service good. We've tried several different items and all have been good. I lived many years in the southeast US, so while I think Mom's is very a good restaurant here, in rural Alabama I'd probably call it average. For Surprise, I'd classify it as great. it's by far the best southern cooking I've found."}
{"text":"These are the sweetest people with actually some damn good comfort food. I've had the fired chicken, mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, fried shrimp, onion rings, and peach cobbler. All of it was very good. My wife and I will be going here again and again. They've made loyal customers out of. The customer service is what really makes this place special."}
{"text":"Best service in AZ by far! Lovely establishment and you feel the love. Food was great, southern hospitality was spot on and the iced tea was perfect. Good home cooking, we will be back! Thank you Mom!"}
{"text":"When I heard about this restaurant I was excited and hopeful.  If you have read any of my other reviews, you know cooking is my hobby.  I'm not a chef but pretty dang great cook and I know good food.  I was surprised this restaurant has received such a high rating as the food was not that impressive.  Up until 2012 when I moved to AZ I had lived in Louisiana and Virginia since 1994 and was raised by mother who was born and raised in GA so I know southern food.  I will breakdown each item:  I ordered Fried chicken w/ mac n cheese and cornbread stuffing.  Chicken had a good crispiness and would have been really good with just a little more salt and seasoning in the coating.  It was a little bland but cooked well.  The mac n cheese: 5 cheese? Barely yellow in color so unsure how much cheddar was actually in there but I could taste a little bit of the flour they used to make the roux base and again ADD SOME SALT. Someone made the comment that it was the best mac n cheese they ever had.  Girl you need to come to my house.  I'll show you some mac n cheese.  Cornbread stuffing: They put sugar in the cornbread and I thought I tasted a touch of clove and cinnamon.  This wasn't necessarily bad and the gravy over the top was REALLY good but I like my cornbread stuffing more savory less sweet.  Biscuits were good but a little dense and the gravy they served with them was ok.  The jalapeno cornbread was ok but not awesome.  Best cornbread ever is in Harlem at the Red Rooster.  Red Velvet cake? Ok more like dark pink velvet.  Frosting needed more butter or should I say any butter and the cake was a little dry.  I took a bite of my mom's sweet potato pie, very good!  Mom had the fried catfish, greens and also the cornbread stuffing.  The catfish was KILLER!  REALLY REALLY GOOD! Greens? Come on guys you're supposed to be from the south WTH?  Absolutely no flavor at all.  Again, salt and if they were cooked with bacon, fatback, ham or ham hock it was undetectable.  So sad cause making good greens is cooking 101 in the South.  I ordered Gumbo for my dinner later this evening: Ok I cut people a lot of slack when it comes to gumbo cause quite frankly there are key ingredients that make an excellent gumbo and you can only get them in Louisiana.  I learned to make gumbo from my ex-mother in law.  The first time I ever made this one of my ex's Cajun friends said, \"Damn dude she transplants easy.\"  The key to a great chicken and sausage gumbo is your roux and the sausage you use.  There is a place in Iowa, LA called Rabideaux's.  This is the BEST smoked sausage for gumbo.  For my taste and knowledge of gumbo, the gumbo here was fair but had a decent/ok flavor for the ingredients they have to work with.  If you are not from the South and don't really know what gumbo tastes like, you will most likely enjoy it.  Although I think it is a bit pricey at $12.50 for a 10 oz bowl.    Our check for food only was $57 which wasn't terrible but long story short, I would only come here again for the catfish and sweet potato pie.  If you are from the West and have an idea of Southern cooking is but haven't spent years really knowing what it should taste like, you will probably be pleased with the food so I would encourage you to try it at least once.  If you are an experienced Southerner you will most likely, for the most part agree with me but I would still encourage you to try the food and definitely the catfish."}
{"text":"If you want a good home cooked southern meal go to Mom's Fixins. We happened to be in the area and saw the sign so decided to try it.  We are glad we did!  We even met Mom and what a wonderful experience. If you are from the South or just enjoy a delicious home cooked Southern meal, Mom's is a must. We live in Scottsdale and I can guarantee we will take the drive and be back. Between three of us, we tried the friend chicken, pork chop and catfish. Our sides included okra, black eyed peas, and mac and cheese. If we could give the food 10 stars we would.  We will never even attempt to make black eyed peas again as they could never be as good as Mom's. The service is also amazing, most friendly staff you can tell they really enjoy working there."}
{"text":"We have been there three times and are very disappointed. Two pieces of fried chicken and two small sides is absurdly priced. Cole slaw was poorly made. Okra is the same as at Church's fried chicken. Overall, a limited menu. I cannot see how this restaurant will survive."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the City of Surprise restaurant scene.  This could be my go-to place for every meal.  First, everything is homemade. Second, portions are large.  Third prices are reasonable.  Met a business associate for lunch the other day and we both left stuffed. We were greeted with an appetizer of cornbread and biscuits and gravy.  It was so good I could have cancelled my lunch order and just had a big plate of biscuits and gravy.  I'm glad I didn't since I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes and Greens.  The chicken was crispy outside and tender and juicy inside.  The greens were laced with ham hocks and the potatoes were very tasty.  My friend had the meatloaf and was equally pleased.  For dessert we tried the peach cobbler.....super tasty, steaming hot and great with the side of vanilla ice cream.  I highly recommend you check this restaurant out.  The staff is incredibly friendly and Clearetta, the owner and her daughter Patrina both made time to stop by our table and chat."}
{"text":"Mom's Fixins was ok. It wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. I don't know how else to describe it. The chicken was good but the rest of the sides I could pass on."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I'm from North Carolina and I miss southern food.  This place has amazing Biscuits and gravy,  sweet tea and fried chicken.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Went to Mom's Fixings today with a friend.... we both had the chicken fried chicken ..... Delish!!!!!!  Comes with two sides and a wedge waffle..... a little pricey but what you get makes it worth it  Everything was so flavorful and really did seem like we were eating a homemade meal!!  Service was awesome ... friendly... welcoming.... can't say enough about this place except will be back soon"}
{"text":"Great food ! Cornbread waffles???? OMG! Super yummy ! I didn't care for the cabbage . I prefer mine cooked not crunchy . That said, the chicken was cooked to perfection and fresh.  German chocolate cake was also a win !"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The service is friendly and very good. This is the best place for fried chicken, fried cabbage, sweet potato fries and the banana pudding. We have been there a couple times and I loved the chicken so much I ordered it again. I will be trying something else the next go around."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!  Even the executive chef came out to see how we liked the food. The waffles ... Holy cow! Delicious!  We had the chicken fried chicken and it was soooooo good. Good serving sizes. I will definitely go back to mamas!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is so good - if you like authentic southern comfort food.  Also, the service is very good and attentive.  The jalapeno waffles, southern fried chicken, biscuits with gravy . . . so good I think I left my body of couple of times during the meal!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Was told to come here by a coworker and tried three times and each time we missed them because they were closed. I'm so glad we came the fourth time because it was over worth it. Can't say enough about the service and food. Can't wait to come back to try the other entrees. So glad to have soul food on the west valley!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my brother today. Loved the warm family atmosphere here. Our server was very sweet and attentive to our needs. She made sure to check on us and refilled our drinks before being asked. I ordered the chicken fried chicken with robust gravy, mashed potatoes and gravy, fried okra, and steak fries. The portions are perfect. Not too much and not too little. Mashed potatoes were very tasty and I couldn't stop myself from eating the fries. I ordered food Togo for my family and our food was discounted. I enjoyed the food and the wonderful service here. Would highly recommend this place. Thank you for the great food!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and very friendly staff. I would highly recommend giving this place a try. Very clean inside also. The whole family had a great time and we all enjoyed our meal. We went on a Sunday morning and it was not that busy but started to get busy at around noon. 5 stars."}
{"text":"4.5 stars but did not think four stars was fair given my only disappointment was the lunch pricing. Aside from pricing, my family really enjoyed our lunch. It is nice to see Surprise has a restaurant that is worth visiting, as there are not many in my opinion. For our meals today, we had the meatloaf that came with candied yams and waffle, the bacon barbecue pork burger, and the chicken tenders with fries. Every meal item listed was very tasty. The meatloaf had good flavor with gravy and this is coming from a guy that prefers a sweet glaze. The barbecue pork burger was good and just needed a bit more sauce. Lastly, the chicken tenders tasted very fresh and my daughter loved them. Every side item was on point but the winner was the candies yams. Oh damn, they were good.  Staff was great and friendly.  Again, price point was a little high but enjoyed our visit and would stop by again for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The ONLY downside is that it clearly isn't the healthiest option, but if you're looking for healthy and you're coming to this restaurant then you need to re-evaluate what your expectations are for eating out. I got the ribs, for OBVIOUS reasons. And the stuffing. And the sweet potatoes. And I can't even deal with how good it all was. I probably gained about 16 lbs eating there for my one meal but it's ok. I can always hit the gym for 8 hours a day 5 days a week to burn it off! Eat here. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Shortly after they opened I had a chance to enjoy some good soul food/southern cooking. Good prices and thoroughly delicious.   I recommend the catfish!"}
{"text":"Service was a 5/5, but the food was just mediocre at best. I got the grilled chicken with two sides, corn and sweet potato fries. The chicken and sweet potato fries were fine, but the corn was terrible canned corn. My son got the fried shrimp basket for $16. It came with one side and 7 pieces of shrimp. The fries were fine, but the shrimp were over cooked and rubbery. $50 with tip for two adult meals and one kid's meal. It was definitely not worth that at all. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Southern home cooking at its best! I wish we would have had room for dessert. Came across this gem while in Surprise. The food was fresh and cooked just right. They have a kids menu and drinks are included with the kids meals. They have fresh brewed unsweet and sweet teas. My kids had the cheeseburger sliders and fries, grilled cheese with mac and cheese and fried cod nuggets (hand breaded)with fries. The kids ate it all! So that's a good sign. Lol I had the special of the day, catfish and cornmeal breaded jumbo shrimp with sweet potato fries. My husband had meatloaf with butter corn and mashed potatoes. Our food came fairly quick and it was perfect. I would recommend you try this place. We would go back for this awesome comfort food. But next time we will save room for dessert...banana pudding or peach cobbler. Yum!"}
{"text":"There is a shortage of restaurants in Surprise so we decided to try Mom's Fixins. We were happy to see that the restaurant was busy, but we still only had a 5 minute wait to be seated. The food was outstanding. I had the bacon pulled pork burger (not a combination that I would have tried at home, but trust me, it worked). My wife had the fried catfish, which she said was also very good. The portions are BIG so be sure to bring your appetite"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the work crew.. if your looking for fancy.. it's not gonna happen. If your into real southern type food welll! Here ya go.. no frills a bit slow service but the catfish was on point! Cabbage actually had bacon in it.. thank ya Jesus's! Go get your meal on but trust you won't be able to breathe after the fact.. enjoy... Good for Surprise!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good, waffles were awesome.  Overall the place is nice and the food is good just a little pricey"}
{"text":"Insanely good home style food with a friendly staff lead by the amazing Mom. I love it when a locally owned restaurant opens and makes a statement. Mom's is just such a restaurant. You don't have to like southern cooking to find something you'll like. I've had the meatloaf (awesome), fried chicken, ribs, and the cornbread waffles.There are a lot of different sides. With the ribs I had onion rings and green beans, and it was perfect. Desserts? You bet! The Sweet Potato Pie is great. The Peach Cobbler is great. The Bread Pudding is GREAT! The atmosphere is nice with big windows, high ceilings, and light colors. It's open, but not to loud. The only down side for me are the tables close to the service counter on the north side of the dinning room, rather tight with people walking behind you. But then again, I saw so wrapped up in my food even that wasn't a big deal. Good luck Mom and that's for coming to Surprise."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Southern food eater but we had the Fried chicken strips, hot links, mixed greens, fried spinach and black eyed peas and waffle cornbread. They served us a complimentary appetizer of biscuits and gravy. Gravy could have had a little mor zing. Everything was delicious. Courteous staff and reasonable at $10.50 each with sides."}
{"text":"We have been several times. Service was always good. My husband loves the fish. I tried the pork chop and chicken both were delicious. I personally did not like the Mac & Cheese but my husband did. He also loves the greens. I am obsessed with the savory waffle! It's so good! Made with cornbread. It's moist and full of flavor. Mashed potatoes were good. I also did not like the tea but again my husband really liked it. The dining room is comfortable and casual. Great place also to bring the kids. Look up hours of operation before going."}
{"text":"If your looking for good food with a smile come visit moms fixins!   Everyone is beyond sweet and the food and sweet tea is amazing"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the staff was nice and attentive.  I'm only giving it three stars because the food was very bland.  It seems like they are catering to the Sun City crowd instead of making good flavorful food. It was also overpriced for what you get.   We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing fried shrimp and awesome collard greens!! My husband loved the pulled pork cheeseburger. We are lucky to have this restaurant in our city!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! It's nice to have some good family owned restaurants nearby. I'll definitely be going back again and recommending to friends and family."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a good southern/soul food place open up nearby! This place had a few bumps at first, but who doesn't? They've definitely gotten better. The food sometimes takes a little while (enjoy the complimentary biscuits and gravy while you wait) but they cook to order and it is worth it!  I've had the fried chicken. So should you! The catfish, after two trips, is a hit and a miss. The second time we came, the portions were huge but a little over cooked. Both my hubby and rib-loving daughter gave a thumbs up to the half rack of baby back ribs.  As for the sides: FRIED CABBAGE and the MAC AND CHEESE!! The green beans were also delicious. Black eyed peas were a little meh. Mashed potatoes shine if you cover them in the house gravy, which should be a course of its own! I look forward to trying the greens on my next visit.  If you are a chicken and waffles person, order a waffle as one of your two sides. Ask for a little honey to drizzle over it. All meals come with a quarter cornbread waffle which had both my teens drooling.  I hear wonderful things about their desserts, but can't get that far without being ready to bust! I only gave them four out of five stars because I believe they have so much room to grow. I will watch them fine tune their offerings and look forward to giving them that 5th star soon! Try them. It's not fast food, but it's good food. It's also definitely made with love!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  Had Gumbo, best I have had in AZ. Spouse had chicken fried steak. REAL chicken, so good.  Greens were to die for along with the cornmeal waffle.  Waiter was a delight.  Will we go back?  At least once a week!"}
{"text":"First time at Mom's on Saturday for lunch...4 of us ladies thought we would try some place new.  The food ws very good and the waiter, DJ was attentive and informative.  I had the catfish, candied yams and black eyed peas......delicious.  I never got around to the waffle.  Other ladies had the fried chicken and also thought it was delicious.  Nothing was greasy and the onion rings were also great.  Our one problem was not being comfortable....we are average size ladies, but there was no elbow room...the tables are a tad too small.   My friends always pay with credit card, i always pay with cash.  My lunch was $13.50 ( plus tax ).  I paid with $20.00 and waiter came back with empty folder....oh, he said, did you want change.  Yes, I want change I said. I wasn't going to leave a $6.50 tip for a $13.50 lunch, he said how do you want it, I said in singles.  Imagine....such nerve."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience yet and I'm not holding my breath till I do. The food is delicious and consistent.Being a southerner I can also say that it's authentic. The wait staff are all very friendly and you can really see that they work together as a team to make sure the guests are all taken care of. I definitely will recommend Mom's Fixins to my friends and when my family from North Carolina come to visit we will for sure come by. Thanks y'all! Keep doing what your doing!"}
{"text":"Really good waffles served with WARM syrup!! Why is it so hard for restaurants to figure that out? Fried chicken was moist and hot, yet nice and crispy on the the outside. Cooked cabbage was perfectly done, warm and tender but with a little crunch left...not at all soggy or slimy...with delicious bacon!   I enjoyed my lunch very much."}
{"text":"Great homemade Southern comfort soul food, great service & good hot home style meal, wish the sides were a little bigger or bowl filled to the top, you won't be disappointed, Mama owns me on Sunday's now !"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was delicious. I tried the gumbo which is only served on Sunday and I really enjoyed the flavor not to spicy it was just right. The fried okra was my absolute favorite. The hubby got the fried chicken which was seasoned just right with the yams and Mac and cheese. Yams were sweet and delicious but the Mac and cheese could be better you could taste the powdered cheese in them. Sweet tea is the best yummy! I would def go again"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves! It was our first time visiting there. The music is nice and the place is very clean. Our server Delaney was kind and helpful. We had the chicken fried chicken meal with mashed potatoes, gravy and buttered corn (the chicken tasted so clean and everything was delicious...I did salt my potatoes a little bit but I would rather add salt myself than have too much in there to begin with), the catfish meal with fried okra and black eyed peas (never had a cleaner piece of catfish and the batter was very good and surprisingly the black eyed peas were the star of the plate...I have never had a restaurant meal where I didn't like at least one thing on my plate and today....this was not the case), the hot links, mashed potatoes and buttered peas (the hot links are indeed hot but the good kind of hot and the peas had a sinful amount of butter...just the way I like them). For dessert we had peach cobbler (the pie crust, cinnamon, peach and butter were very good and authentic tasting and the ice cream was custard-y and smooth and had real pieces of vanilla bean in there...YUMMY) and banana puddin' (it was so good that I want to call it perfect..never had it done so well not even by my mom)!  On the way out the door, we met the most handsome little boy (maybe 4 or 5 years old) at the hostess station named Dimitri. He was polite and sweet and remembered my name and told us to have a good rest of our day.  Everyone was kind from the hostess to the bus boy and girl to our waitress to Dimitri...we WILL be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very surprising restaurant that seemed to appear out of nowhere.  I can just say, I like it.  The food isn't mounds of food for the person to shove down, but it's more than enough  for a single person.  What's better is that the food is very cheap overall.  I ordered a chicken fried chicken for only $4.50 and $2 extra dollars for some sweet potato fries.  That's price that's hard to beat.  As for the food, it was hot, and tastes good.  The gravy is especially exceptional.  The little lumps of meat mixed with the veges and other ingredients come together perfectly.  The service can be a bit better, but it's nothing that can't easily be fixed when they get the hang of things.  Would I go back?  Yes.  And that is all that matters."}
{"text":"The banana pudding is so delicious! Fried chicken and fried cabbage is so yummy! I'm nervous about this place because it is truly addicting! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal with biscuits and gravy waffles and delicious chicken fingers. My wife raved about the meat loaf and mashed potatoes. The fried chicken was very good and crispy. We were so full that we had to take our delicious peach cobbler home to eat later in the evening. We will be back to try other items like the catfish and bbq."}
{"text":"Great home cooked meal! Catfish and shrimp breading were great. So was the fried okra. Greens were delicious too. Star of the show is the cornbread waffle! My son had fried chicken and it was tender and juicy. The only downside is the tables and menus are a little run down. My guess is because they are used a lot. It's a little pricey but worth it for home cooking. Service was good but don't know if I'll be back. Enjoyed the experience though."}
{"text":"I love this place it has the best food. The yams are homemade, the chicken is hot fresh and the biscuits with gravy is the business."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to try this place for lunch. To get right to the point it was nothing special. My wife ordered the fried chicken with Mac and cheese. She said the the chicken was good but wasn't blown away by the food. I ordered the chicken fried chicken with black eyed peas. I also was not wowed by the chicken and the beans were very bland and flavorless. The service is lacking to say the least. I was visited by the bus boy more then our server. I wrote this review after waiting over 10 mins for my check. It is now completed and still no check. I will not return."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly personal, excellent food. Had the catfish, huge pieces and the sides were awesome.  Tried Mac and cheese, greens, black eye pea's, and cabbage. ...will definitely make the trip back!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this just wasn't great. Bacon was featured, but I found it to be quite sweet. And the biscuits and gravy were bland. Service was very good, but the place was very noisy, mostly due to loud kitchen noise."}
{"text":"Food was meh. Service was very slow, but pleasant. The gravy was cold. Will not be back. Nothing about the place makes us want to go back."}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant (12/2) through Yelp, based off reviews figured it was worth a try. Party of five and a half waited about fifteen minutes to be seated, no issue. The owner came around to the tables and personally introduced herself, completely professional and extremely personable. After that however, we sat in the middle of dining room for 45 minutes with no drinks, in fact had no idea whom our server was. Workers walking continuously by our table. Finally, the employees have a bit of a disagreement about who was going to be our server and finally we got help. By now however, the dining room is half empty so I don't quite understand why there was such a delay despite having multiple employees walking around but none of them even noticing our completely empty table. After food was finally served it was marginal at best and barely warm our food was ranging from fried chicken, hot sausage, chicken fried chicken and meatloaf. Won't return."}
{"text":"This local establishment popped up in a Yelp search recently and I decided to bookmark it. Being a big fan of soul food, especially LoLo's, I thought this might be a nice alternative.   My instincts told me that, like some of our recent experiences up in Anthem, the good reviews are somewhat skewed based on the neighborhood that it's serving. In other words, if there are virtually no competitors nearby, the food gets praised much higher than it would if it were located in a more cut throat \"foodie\" neighborhood. Mom's Fixins, for example, is located in Surprise. With all due respect, Surprise doesn't really have an established dining culture. Therefore, my gut instincts told me that, while the reviews are glowingly positive, my girlfriend and I might wind up being disappointed.  Honestly, there's a tinge of guilt writing this review. Mom's is a small up-and-coming business that is only now finding its feet. The people were really nice, the restaurant was inviting, and the variety of options on the menu covers pretty much everything to keep the typical southern-food enthusiast happy (sans the Kool-Aid).  Both my girlfriend and I ordered fried chicken. Two legs for me and a breast and leg for her. With a meal, you get the option of picking two sides. I went with my preferred choices of mac and cheese with mashed potatoes. She went with mac and cheese with fries. Despite being told that we would receive a quarter cut of their cornbread waffle, we decided to order a whole one as well (we love our cornbread).  Before our meals were served, we were surprised with a couple of complimentary biscuits with sausage gravy. The gravy was barely warm, but the biscuits weren't too bad. I felt it was a nice touch. Little things like this are guaranteed to bring back customers for sure. Smart thinking!  As for the chicken? LoLo's this ain't. Lightly crisped, we just felt that it didn't really have much flavor in it in comparison to our favorite. I had to dump far more hot sauce than I normally would just to breathe some kind of life into it. We so badly wanted to like it, but after knowing the full potential of great fried chicken, we just couldn't find anything positive to say about it.  The lightly peppered mac and cheese was pretty standard and kind of reminded me of what I'd get in a buffet. The mashed potatoes seemed more like chopped potatoes. I've always preferred more of a whipped consistency, but I guess this might be chalked up to personal preference.  I was sincerely hoping the cornbread waffles would save the day. It's a clever little creation if nothing else. Sadly, neither one of us were impressed. They don't serve them with butter for some odd reason, but you can request it. We just were expecting a bit more of a flavor pop.  I'll reiterate what I said before. If you've tasted extremely good cornbread, it sort of ruins the cornbread served at 95% of the other restaurants that offer it.  We did not order any dessert. As is usually the case with soul food, you usually feel too guilty afterwards to risk eating anything else.    I'm going to give it an average three stars. While we weren't really impressed with the food, the people were all very nice. Additionally, I feel like it will serve the residents of Surprise quite well. If you live in the area and you're the type that generally doesn't like to drive out of your way for a family meal, I'm sure it'll do just fine. But if you're a fan of places like LoLo's or Bobby Q's, don't go in here expecting to have a duplicate experience, because you most certainly will not.  Recommended if you're confined to Surprise only."}
{"text":"OMG!! Been in the valley 5 yrs now. An fianlly found some good food from back home. I got the Bacon Pulled Pork hamburger. It was truly a awesome sandwich. Had a side of coleslaw to top off the pulled pork. Tasted like the true southern food. My wife had the catfish, mac an cheese, an fried okra. And of course i tasted it all!!! Will be back to to try everything on the menu!!! The service was terrific. From the time we walked in to when we walked out! Our waiter was Kobe, he explained everything well an food was fast. And very nice portions! Prices are good to. Cant say enough about this place."}
{"text":"I think they are having some growing pains. The food was good, even though two of our selections were out for the night (meatloaf and mashed potatoes). Service was very good Jeff was very attentive and was able to recommend some other foods on the menu.  I will try mom's again in a few weeks once they get their legs under them. Surprise definitely need a restaurant like this one here in town."}
{"text":"This place was really good.  Sweet tea was good, everything my husband and I ordered turned out perfect.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich okra and coleslaw.  (Forgot to take a pic.) I got Mac & cheese, cabbage, and chicken fried chicken also an extra order of the cornbread waffle. Plus dessert German chocolate cake and peach cobbler.  Mmm delicious. Service was great very attentive didn't wait long for food. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Brought my son in for his first time. He had the chicken tenders and I had the chicken blt, both delicious. Very friendly service. The yams are delicious! Out of a few things but I didn't mind with it being the slow season & it being a local spot, I just ordered something else. The music is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. A true unexpected gem. The waffle was so legit. I feel like I've been ordering waffles everywhere hoping that it will taste like this one. No other waffle will ever be as good, and is worth your patronage. As is the candied yams and home cooked everything.  Come here to feel like your Grandma (or somebody's Grandma) just hugged you in salt and butter."}
{"text":"If you would like to get something different than anything you can find in Surprise here it is! The catfish is amazing and there are a plethora of wonderful sides from which to choose. The portions are generous and wait until you taste the banana pudding!!  Drive all the way around if you miss the turn.... it's so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Surprise food scene. Consistently delicious entrées, presented well. We will visit on a regular basis.  The fried chicken is incredible. A must try."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Chicken seems to be their specialty, so I ordered the fried chicken. The leg was VERY small, and the thigh was barely medium-sized. The skin was burned in places, yet the meat near the bone was still pink. Needless to say, I didn't eat very much. The cornbread waffle was inedible: hard, stale, and didn't taste like cornbread. I also received smashed (not \"mashed\") potatoes in the exact form of an ice cream scoop, as well as a huge portion of cole slaw.  Two friends liked their pork chop and meatloaf but thought their dinners were overpriced. A third friend ordered the chicken BLT, which was overwhelmed by the amount of bread (Texas toast). A fourth friend ordered the fried chicken, too, which was served a full 7 minutes after mine, and his was cooked all the way through.  The server was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"Took the family for dinner, we had some tasty food. The chicken fried chicken and the sides were delicious. Great spot for our City."}
{"text":"We had driven past Moms Fixins a couple times. We finally stopped in last night. My partner got the Fried Chiekcn with mashed potatoes and fried okra, I got the Pot Roast special. Everything was good, I wasn't a complete fan of the Pot Roast. I think this is just because I think mine is the best....LOL. The BF liked his fried chicken, I tried a piece and it was amazing!  Unsweet tea was great. Service was persona or and efficient. You get complimentary biscuits and gravy as an appetizer. We would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We finally had the opportunity to dine at Mom's Fixins and it was a pleasure. I had the chicken fried chicken with green beans and fried cabbage ($10.50).  Our daughter got the grilled cheese sandwich with butter corn.  Everything  was delicious!  Especially fried cabbage; I wasn't sure what to expect but it was quite a treat!   We also got the banana pudding ($4). You should definitely try it!   Gumbo is only served on Sundays so I have go on a Sunday to try it.   The service was friendly and prompt. Atmosphere was casual and family friendly."}
{"text":"Whoa, what a good experience. Josh was a spectacular waiter: good food suggestions, kind to the kids, quick to refill a tea glass, and both friendly and professional. The food was good and super filling. Come with a big appetite and leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Just finished our meal! Really really yummy! Chicken and waffles aren't on the menu as a meal but you can order a waffle on the side. The chicken breast was super moist! The waffle was amazing! The sweet potatoes are cash money!!!  While you wait they bring you a petite biscuit with delicious gravy. The mac n cheese was good, yummy with the Louisiana hot sauce. The chicken fried chicken was great too, the onions rings were tasty and crunchy. Bananas pudding for desert, yes please. Amazing.   The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is the ambiance was a Little lack luster. The food is southern but the decor is very basic/modern. It was very quiet we could hear everyone convo around us... so maybe some music in the back ground would be good."}
{"text":"As an adult, you're on your own doing adult stuff but, you finally get home back to mom's (or grandma's) house and she feeds you all of her home cooking that you missed and it gives you that warm and fuzzy feeling?   That's this place in the form of a restaurant.   Their hearts are in their food and service provided, at least that's how I felt.    I want to go back just for dessert because it's easy to stuff yourself.   I've been here a few times and don't have any personal suggestions because I've tasted most of the menu since I'm often in a group and we sample each other's plate."}
{"text":"Simple ingredients cooked with love...it doesn\"t get much better than that. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Philly Steak sandwich. My Chicken Fried Steak was lean but juicy and tender. They have a huge variety of sides from which to choose. Very friendly staff in a clean space."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today but they are only doing takeout until dinner time at 4:30pm. Went back for dinner about 6pm.   The biscuits and gravy appetizer was unexpected and the biscuits were very tender, some of the best I've had. My husband had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, greens and fried cabbage. I had the chicken fried chicken, fried cabbage and cornbread dressing. Everything was quite good, only real complaint was that the sides weren't hot.  Very pleased that nothing was over salted.  They are clearly working out the kinks but trying very hard to do a good job. Give them a try.  Marlee S can stay home and leave room for people who are willing to give this place a chance to make it."}
{"text":"Great southern food.  Another road trip for us from Gilbert, but it was worth it.  I ordered the BBQ ribs and they were amazing.  They don't skimp on portions.  The meat loaf was ordered by a friend and it tasted amazing as well.  Fried chicken could have used a little more seasoning but was still delicious and super crispy!  Mac and cheese was perhaps the best I have ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"Food and service went downhill for me. Maybe it was my fault for going close to their closing hours... but still... husband and I were the only customers there and it took 30+ minutes to get our food. I feel the quality of the food went downhill as well.... so sad."}
{"text":"Are here for dinner last night. Thought we'd give it a try as the reviews were good.  We were sat right away but waited at least 30 minutes for our food. My husband ordered fried chicken with mashed potatoes with gravy on the side. He ordered a side of brown gravy and a side of chicken gravy.  And he ordered buttered corn. I ordered chicken strips with the same two sides. The chicken for both of us was good and juicy but could have been more flavorful. They put gravy on my husbands potatoes instead of it being on the side and the side gravy when they brought it was the same as what was on the potatoes. The corn was disappointing - it was clearly out of a can. The cornbread waffle was dry without much flavor.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious and so were the biscuits.   They serve Coke products which is a plus."}
{"text":"Finally proper fried chicken in the valley, mom has it perfected to the tee. I am fortunate enough to work close by so have been able to order in for lunch once a week for the last few weeks. My go to is the fried chicken, but will have to venture off soon to try the catfish, I've heard it is delectable. The sides are spot on as well, so far I've had the mac and cheese, the fried okra, the greens and fried cabbage, all of which have been done to perfection. Ill be back sometime this week for sure. Thanks Patrina, Bea and of course Loretta!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch on Saturday. I had the fried chicken and my wife had the chicken fried chicken both were really tasty we had some banana pudding for dessert which was really good as well. Service was quick and friendly. I would certainly come back again."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the food was delicious!! We had the Chicken salad, macaroni and cheese and jalapeño bacon cornbread waffle.  It was yummy!! Would definitely return if we were locals."}
{"text":"I went in because it was highly recommended. The taste was REALLY good. but the prices were a little high. I went mid-week to try the ribs and to my surprise they only serve them on the weekends. the weekly menu is a little short so i just chose something basic. I ordered the chicken with mac n cheese and yams. really really good"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The smothered pork chop was perfectly cooked.  The fried cabbage is so good!  Our waiter Josh was great.  He always had our drinks full and making sure we had all we needed.  If you need some good Southern food and sweet southern tea this is the place to be!!  Be sure and ask for Josh!!!!"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy are brought to table once you're seated. Excellent, really enjoyed both. The place is very friendly. Good addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good words for Mom's Fixins. When traveling I like to venture to new places and try to patronize the small businesses .   Although getting your food was longer than anticipated and we did order our food extra crispy. The food was very hot and the portions are more than enough. We didn't realize you were brought appetizers  of biscuits and gravy . I typically do not eat gravy with biscuits but I tried them and they were light and fluffy and the gravy was not heavy and seasoned well.  Sweet tea was like grandma's.   Bathrooms are very cleaned and smell good .   Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, and I decided to try this place for lunch. We were not prepared for what we would find here. This is truly a unique place and i cant wait to try everything else they have to offer. **must try their fried chicken tenders. These are nothing like frozen tenders, they are incredible! The cornbread waffles with fried chicken, the fried fish, greens, sliders...Everything we tasted blew us away. I cant wait to try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for food I would have expected to be served on styrofoam at a low end chain.  BBQ is only served Friday-Sunday.  After having ribs on Friday evening, my only assumption is they put it in the smoker mere hours prior.   I have had gas station chicken that wasn't nearly as tough.  When you are trying to have BBQ on special days, at least do it right.  Fiancé' had the chicken tenders, and those again I can compare to those from a gas station, because that is where I think they got them from."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food. Good personal experience. They really bring the south to the west. Okra and fried catfish to die for"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. This is stick to the ribs comfort food so plan on a nap afterward. They do not serve breakfast."}
{"text":"We crave Southern & yes love Lola's ... But it's too far ! I haven't found anywhere for 4 yrs that's good like this in the West Valley till now! Love Jalapeño bacon Waffle ! Love the fried chicken ! We know fried chicken from WV, Ohio, Nebraska, Louisiana, SC & Georgia .. This is great ! Simple Southern Family cookin !"}
{"text":"We decided to try Mom's Fixins and it was a good choice. I had fried catfish, candied yams, and fried cabbage. My husband had fried chicken, mixed greens and the yams. My fish consisted of 2 nice sized fillets with a deliciously light breading. No thick batter hiding the fish here. The cabbage was pan fried with bacon (I've now found a new way to prepare cabbage at home). The yams were very sweet and ended up taking the place of dessert for us both. Breading on the chicken was good, too. The only minus to me is things seemed salty. I'm not a salt person, so it was noticeable to me and I drank a lot of water. My husband, who prefers more salt than I normally cook with, didn't notice the salt. To him it was fine.   Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. The executive chef came by and asked how everything was.   All in all, a good meal. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Used to serve liquor/beer took friends and found they stopped serving liquor due to lack of interest didn't want to make.  Big deal of it do we stayed, food was ok portions not very big still hungry, little over priced"}
{"text":"Meat loaf was okay. Sweet corn was watery not sweet at all. Fired chicken was a little off.  Biscuits and gravy were good. Ice tea sweet and lemonade was great! Sorry was really hoping we would love it and come back more often."}
{"text":"Our first visit and the food was great! I couldn't decide on two sides so I got three. The catfish was very good. I had fried okra, mixed greens, and blackeyed peas. All tasty and fresh!  My wife got the chicken fried steak and yams. All very tasty. Recommend this spot for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere but it took a while to get our lunch. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Better than three other soul food spots I have visited! I highly recommend it. Pardon the partially eaten ribs, couldn't wait to dig in and forgot the pic!"}
{"text":"Ok, Lolo's definitely has some potential competition!   It's nice to have a local southern spot in my backyard.   Restaurant is nice, clean. A little dead and you can definitely tell they are new to the game. Hours of operations are all over the place.   Food was pretty good for the price. I had fried chicken,  mixed greens, yams and Mac and cheese which came with a waffle cornbread all for about $15.  Wasn't a fan of the waffle cornbread. Was pretty bland and dry.  Mac and cheese had a lot of pepper in it. Mixed greens was a little to cooked for my taste (but still good).  Yams were on point.   Would definitely like to see this place grow. Will be back."}
{"text":"If you enjoy the southern cuisine, you'll like it here. From the varied menu which will certainly have your taste buds singing to the authentic home cooked food. I had the biscuits and gravy and the wife had a gumbo. Both were excellent. The service here is friendly, personable and the decor is simple yet charming. The speed of service is slower than what you may be accustomed to but being that everything is made from scratch and to order that is to be expected.  All this at a fair price, and it's not another chain.   Get out and try it, support this local business. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great addition to Surprise. The fried chicken had seasoning and the collared greens were superb. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Anyone in the service business knows the term \"touching tables\".  I personally love it!   I think it shows that you care, you're real and you love your job.   We've eaten here twice and Mama has come to our table each time to ask how things were.   EVERYTHING is Delicious! It's real authentic down home cookin'!  *sweet tea served in mason jars.  Ohhh...Yeah!"}
{"text":"This is when I wish Yelp gave us the opportunity to rate the service of a place and rate the food separately.  Food I give 4.5 stars. You get complementary biscuits and gravy to start. I want to say the gravy was chicken based. It was yummy. Meal wise I had the fried chicken with green beans and Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was the best Mac I've ever had. The combo of cheeses made it so milky and creamy. Green beans had great flavor with the bacon. Fried chicken was good. Crispy and moist. But! The flavoring was actually bland. Maybe  I'm just used to intense seasonings.  Hubby had the slab of ribs. Ribs were a little dry but sauce was good and sweet.  Service was just poor. Our waitress didn't listen to anything I would say. Took forever to get our bill and get cashed out. I ordered a side salad asking for it to come out first. It came out with all my food. She kept apologizing. But needs improvement."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to work at a dentistry very close to Mom's Fixins and I REALLY needed the bathroom and I didn't want to show up my job asking for the bathroom. I stopped over here and said hello sorry I really need the bathroom and the waitress was super nice about it and told me that it happens to the best of us. After I finished working I came back to order my food and the waitress was very helpful with my strange request of \"the fastest thing to cook in the menu that I can eat while driving\" and got me some of the best chicken tenders which came with a buttery waffle and two awesome sides! The food was great the service was amazing I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Nothing survives in this location. I think this is the third or fourth restaurant that's tried to make it, and all of them inevitably close up shop. Not because they serve bad food, either, which is strange.    So we passed by the building and saw a new place called \"Mom's Fixins\" had opened. Sounded southern, so we were picturing fried chicken, bbq, and cornbread. And we were right.    We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. We took a quick look at the menu and the tables and then saw the bar. We sat at the bar. We met Mark, the bartender, who is the son of the owner of the business, and told us that his mother created the recipes for the food there. I noticed a Pulled Pork, Bacon & Burger sandwich on special, and couldn't think of anything that could possibly sound better than that. My wife, who is originally from western Virginia and has been fed fried chicken and gravy from birth, had the fried chicken, corn, and mashed potatoes (with gravy, naturally).   Both dishes were excellent. Would definitely go back. Definitely the best fried chicken I've had in Arizona, and I can't think of any other restaurant that has a BBQ pork, bacon, and burger, burger.  Outstanding.  Although we're usually not dessert people, my wife wanted to try the banana pudding, and I'm glad she did. I don't know if I've ever had banana pudding before, but I'm absolutely going to have it here again.   - Not a full bar, but adequate beer and wine choices. - The staff is friendly. Say hello to Mark behind the bar.  - Ridiculously good fried chicken. - Cornbread waffles with the entrees. Damn good.   I would recommend only eating here AFTER you finish your workout for the day, because the food is unbelievably filling.   So give Mom's Fixins a shot. The name is kinda boring, but the food is amazing, and I'm hoping this place sticks around for a long time.  There's nothing else like it in Surprise, and you really should give it a shot."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken! Great atmosphere. The staff was welcoming and Renee was a fantastic waitress. The biscuits & gravy appetizer was cute & yummy. The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly! We also had Mac & Cheese & mashed potatoes, both flavored very well. The cornbread waffle was honey's fav. Great lunch spot off the beaten path. If we lived here, we would definitely be regulars!!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay and the portions were way to small lol.  Anyway my sister ordered from here a week ago and got the double stack of bbq ribs, 3 legs of fried chicken, a order of French fries, candied yams,  macaroni and cheese,  and corn bread.  When she was on the phone with the lady she was telling them that it was for three people and will that be enough.  The lady said that it would be enough so my sister thought it was fine.  However on her way almost home she noticed that the food was not enough for three people at all.  They only gave her 1 small serving of corn bread (it was tiny lol)  one small portion of Mac & cheese and a small serving of candies yams.  So when she got to the house we were starving and told her it was okay because she felt so bad about it (especially considering the price for what you get).     We just split the food up.  I had the chicken and my mom and sister had the ribs.  My mom and I also had had fries and we just let my sister have the sides but not before we tasted it. The Mac & cheese tasted like it came out of a box.  It was creamy but it wasn't real southern baked mac & cheese at all.  The candied yams had little to no flavor and it literally just tasted  like sweet potato's and simple syrup...  yeah not good.  The waffle corn bread tasted okay but it was no Lolo's or Ezekiels.  The ribs were good but we wished there was more of an authentic southern smoky flavor.  The The chicken that I had was okay nothing spectacular and  two out of three of them were a bit burned but what can you do.  The French fries were good although they were not hand cut they were frozen fried steak like fries.  Overall just not a pleasant experience and we won't be back. When me and my family want some good old fashion soul/ southern food We'll  stick to what we know Lolo's and Ezekiels or the better option and cook it ourselves."}
{"text":"West Valley residents need to come out and support Mom's Fixins.  I had fried chicken and waffles, and it was very good!  The chicken had nice, crispy skin, but was very moist inside - nicely done.  The waffles were very good.  I would come back just to have the waffles - light and fluffy but with the crisp exterior of the Belgian waffle.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This place is home-cooking, plain and simple, with genuinely nice staff.  Re: prior posts - I agree that Surprise does not exactly have a vibrant food scene, and we go to Central PHX frequently to find good restaurants.  Which is why we need to support Mom's and keep it going.  It is good food at a competitive price in the West Valley.  Yes, I like Lolo's as well, and will likely go back some time, but Mom's was also quite satisfying and I think it would be a good throw down to compare.  Similar concepts but we the food was a little different.  We felt good leaving Mom's, but not like a gut bomb as was the case when we left Lolo's and their ridiculously large portions.  Good fried chicken can be tricky to find, and we have a place here in AZ that is well worth the consideration.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Incredible service and food here! Everyone, from the hostess to the waitress to Mom herself, was friendly, thoughtful, and perfectly wonderful.   Everything was made fresh to order. This is authentic southern cooking, folks.   The bacon pulled pork burger is to die for! OMG!"}
{"text":"Fabulous first time experience. My husband and I like to try non-commercial fares and were really pleased. The food is comfort/soul food at great prices considering you are eating real food prepared as your mom or grandma might.  Actually, the food was so pretty, we almost didn't want to eat it. Portions are hearty. Chicken and fish (our orders, were sizable. This place is family owned and run. They answered our questions when they came out to check on our experience. It was great to learn they only buy American food sources. Ambiance was comfortable, clean and modern. Desserts are also home made baked goods. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Awful restaurant. It's just the new name of another mediocre place in the same space. Tried it today. The inept waitress spilled cokes and grape sodas on myself and my wife. Free desert...? Maybe something taken off the bill...? Nope. Food was ok at best.  Great job with the customer service....not. Maybe we will try this place again when it closes and reopens as something else next year. Thanks for the sticky legs and the chicken strip for my pups!"}
{"text":"Wow homemade download love in every bit! Suggested highly, recommend most highly loved it"}
{"text":"Sounds like some opening day issues on Day 1.  We were there on day 2. This is a real gem in Surprise. I had the Chicken fried Chicken and it was wonderful. My son had the catfish and it was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The only hiccup was that I received the bill before I was asked if I wanted dessert. The peach cobbler sounds good. We'll save it for next time as I will definitely be back. It's a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"Tasty food in a newly redecorated space.  Can't wait to go back.  On Saturday she features the pulled pork.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of this kind of food which makes this review easy. The rest of my family loves this kind of food and after their only complaint is that they don't serve breakfast especially after Archies and New York Flavor closed was the only downside which is good. If I were a food critic I could take their chicken fried chicken and cornbread waffles and it would quite possibly be the best chicken and waffles for someone who didn't have a preconceived notion of what to expect for chicken and waffles. Parking , Awesome , Service .. Just like you'd like not perfect but very good and REAL , food Perfect for what it is. And my personal favorite was the positive attitude of the guy taking out the trash. It warms my heart if the guys taking out the trash are happy at work , weather he was the owner , a first day employee whatever , to me it says a lot."}
{"text":"Appearance  My first visit here with the kids and it was excellent. Seeing the cleanliness of the restaurant and patio area left a great first impression. The music in the restaurant wasn't too loud and the booths were clean and comfortable.   Service   The server Djuan was very friendly and accommodating. He had good knowledge of the menu and explained all the specials upon request. He tried to up-sell when it was appropriate and I agreed seeing that it was my first time here and I wasn't disappointed. He offered dessert but I didn't have any room left. The last restaurant I visited the server asked \"You didn't want any dessert did you?\" Uhhhh I guess not. Djuan did everything right and I appreciate him checking up on us frequently.  Food  Now for the good part. After we ordered, Djuan brought us the most delicious homemade biscuits and gravy I've ever had. I ordered the meatloaf and asked for candied yams and onion rings for my sides. The food was hot and delicious. The meatloaf was very tender and the gravy was a great added taste. I've never been the biggest fan of yams but c'mon I was in a restaurant that serves southern food. You gotta have yams especially with the word \"candied\" in front of it. Im not an \"OMG\"kinda guy but....O...M...G came to mind when the burst of flavor hit my tastebuds. Delicious. The onion rings were batted perfectly and were delicious as well. I agreed to pay a dollar more for the bacon jalapeño waffle corn muffin and it was well worth it. To put the food in perspective, while my 3 year old danced around in the booth after repeated demands for him to sit down he fell and his arm went right in his food. He proudly licked his forearm clean in an effort not to waste such delicious food. Please see my 2 pictures.   We'll come back again. It's so nice to have another option for lunch and dinner in Surprise."}
{"text":"Just disappointed... I was really excited to come here and we visited today. All of the staff were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I even had a pretty good steak sandwich. I'm kind of dumbfounded though. Our waitress spilled our drinks on myself and my husband. Like really spilled and it was Coke and Grape soda. So bad we had to change tables so they could mop it up. I'm not sure I would have been looking for an entirely free meal but no discount, nothing offered in return but the half empty Grape sodas she spilled on our laps. Ugh! Ruined my day... Not going back."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is, daaaaaang mama! You don't go to mama's kitchen you are making wrong decisions in life. Just go. And, make sure you get dessert. Go head mama. I see you...."}
{"text":"WOW!!! When I go into new places to eat, I have a habit of asking the server what food would they order.  And they were SPOT ON!!! Fried cabbage?  who'd thought??  but i couldn't stop eating it!  And the flavor of the fried chicken is off the charts!!! Wife had Bacon Burger pulled pork sandwich.  She said it was the best burger/bbq sandwich she's had!  we will be back!"}
{"text":"From Vegas visiting and felt like some BBQ... yelp didn't fail us. The whole family was happy which doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Mom's Fixins. The ribs, fried and Mac and cheese were delicious. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at 6:00 p.m. for dinner. We were promptly greeted and seated. There were 12 other diners eating there. Our server was a nice young man and he was prompt and wanted to make sure our dining experience was enjoyable. Now for the food. Before our meal arrived we were served two small biscuits and sausage gravy which was bland. Our main dinner arrived. I had the meatloaf with a tomato red gravy with real mashed potatos, greens, and fried cabbage. The meatloaf was soaking in grease and it was very bland except for a strong flavor of sage. Yuck! Every side I had was bland. It all tasted like warmed hospital food. My wife had the Chicken fried chicken. Her's tasted just as bad. She had the mac n cheese and it tasted water down. The service was great. However, the food needs lots of work."}
