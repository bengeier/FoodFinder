{"text":"Was looking for a good place to eat in Vegas and read some great reviews on Yelp about this place in North Las Vegas.  This place is amazing!!! I met the owner, Nicole, who is great! She makes everything from scratch including the potato chips, sweet potatoes fries and salad dressings. I ordered the Build Your Own Hamburger with grilled onions & avocado. Yumm!"}
{"text":"RANDY IS THE WORST PERSON EVER. I always order from them, however today when i walked in after making a phone order- I was totally ignored, and Randy let my food sit for 20min. After he served everyone else before me, even though I was first in line- I asked him \"was that my food\", he stated \" Yes, but your always on your phone when you come in and i think thats Fucking rude\". I was in shock because rather Im on my phone or not, I give them business. He then \"snatches\" my card out my hand and swipe it after i told him I DO NOT WANT THE FOOD. HE IS VERY RUDE AND A RACIST. HES A REAL LIVE RACIST BUT pretends to be otherwise. I will never go there- and I highly recommend people not to go as well. Very rude guy named Randy. If he treats customers like that-  I feel sorry for what they may do to people food if their on there phone in the cafe (since he hates when you talk on your phone). NEVER EAT HERE. NEVER!!! HE IS A RACIST AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL PERSON THAT NEEDS TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS. ONLY REASON I GAVE ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I HAD TOO- HE NEEDS ZERO STARS!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE place. Do yourself a favor and order the country fried steak eggs and gravy. Fabulous! The owner, Randy Petas, knows hospitality and football! Can't say enough good things. Try it!"}
{"text":"Philly steak and sweet potato fries really hit the spot. If you're looking for somewhere new to go for lunch, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Overall I ordered a cheese burger with fries and a drink..waiter wasn't a good listener to our order ..meat wasn't cooked to my liking ..partner didn't get the cheese he wanted and it wasn't nice quality food I would say one step above McDonald's..to say the least pressed meat is never acceptable. Atmosphere was pleasant though."}
{"text":"Nicole the owner was so awesome, life saver from EDC.  She welcomed us like family, service and food are awesome, every body should experience the race day quality food."}
{"text":"A nice little cafe with a race theme near, what else? The racetrack! French tip sandwich was good, sausage and biscuits were good, omelets were good. And the prices were excellent."}
{"text":"When considered only within its class of eateries, may well deserve 5 stars.  Anyway, food is great, very reasonable prices, staff is friendly.  Two visits, got the breakfast combo (pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage) and enjoyed it both times - not greasy like a lot of diners, and the sausage wasn't overly salty like I find too often in cheaper places; bacon cooked precisely as requested and seemed like good quality ingredients all around.  Prices are very reasonable; coffee and breakfast combo was just under $10.  Free wifi for customers was convenient."}
{"text":"If I can give this place no stars...that would be the case. Came in in here 10/29/17 to have breakfast. It was 8:15 and now 8:50, and still has not been asked what we would like to order. Waitress said her other staff is running late. Then 2 other waitress came and started assisting 4 tables before us even though we were here first.  You would think if there was a race that day that they would be fully staff. Unfortunately there are no other places to eat so we r stuck here."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today. Different location, but very cool place.  Great service and food. Had the chicken,bacon ceaser wrap. Very good. Highly recomend this place."}
{"text":"Interesting menu...went there several months back after visiting the Shelby museum and exotic cars across the road - and everything we ordered was great. Wife had the chai tea and loved it. Will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Great little stop on our way to Park City. Had a tasty lunch I had the Western Burger with onion rings and my husband had the Special of the day( Thursday ) the Meatball Sub. Both were very good and the service was lovely. Local owners and a very Mom and Pop feel with lots of Racing Memorabillia for the Guys to look out while waiting for their food. We'll go back again probably really really busy during the NASCAR Race"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Nicole, the owner is so welcoming and down to earth that I felt I was home talking to my mom. The service is punctual and the food is spectacular !! I had a cheese burger with cheddar cheese, jalape√±o and avocado which was fantastic! Nicole brought out home made French fries which should be illegal they were so good and then she brought out the meat loaf special for us to sample...exceptional!!! We will be back and tell our friends about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Out of town, simple, and small town feel.  I called in my order for lunch today and it was seamless. Even though I came in a little early I ended up having a nice discussion with the new waiter. This food is made with love.   P.S. my wife loves your onion rings, best in a 30mile radius....duh"}
{"text":"First time in for me and my girlfriend just had a simple breakfast food was very good you could also hear the race cars across the street very relaxing area very clean good service we will we turn"}
{"text":"Steak and eggs were great! Eggs seemed to be real, no traffic to fight and service is friendly! Just a short drive from Nellis AFB. Rye roast is swirly type. Food came out quick...yelp is still telling me the review is short..."}
{"text":"If you are coming out to the Speedway to visit Exotics Racing then Race Day Cafe is a great place to stop for breakfast or lunch. They have a great menu including burgers, sandwiches, salads and wraps. Friendly staff, great prices and fast service. They have a few tvs also playing various sports."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Food was not. Coffee was cold and metallic tasting, burgers had a weird taste. Nothing special with everything else we ordered."}
{"text":"I think the staff was very friendly, service was very good, food was very good.  We all got salads and they were prepared thoughtfully and were fresh.  We dined outside and had our little (well behaved) dog and they even brought him water."}
{"text":"I work in the area and happened to try it once and I love it I got the carved hoagie it was wonderful and eat there as often as I can"}
{"text":"My wife works near here so we decided to meet for lunch. Pretty good place to eat. Nothing bad about the place but nothing exceptional. Had the turkey club sandwich and it was ok. Again, not bad but not great. Just good enough to meet my wife for a convenient lunch. Would come back for lunch with the wife again. She had buffalo chicken wrap and she says she'd give it a 3 star too. Server was nice and friendly and no long wait for food or drinks. Would recommend for a quick meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Prices and AMAZING Service. Couldn't ask for a better place this close to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.   If I could rate it 6 stars I would.   Thanks Grahm H"}
{"text":"We found a groupon deal for this location while approaching las vegas so gave it a try. Ordered Thai tea, chocolate milk shake, and angus steak sandwich (added avocado) with sweet potato fries. -Thai tea was less sweet than most thai teas at Asian restaurant but the thai tea flavor was not as strong. -Chocolate milk shake was creamy and tasty. -The steak sandwich was delicious! We ordered medium rare but it came out medium...still tasted great! Tender and juicy!   Service was standard. Overall it was a good groupon deal!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was awesome! Such nice people! They let us eat on the patio with our dog and they brought him ice water! So sweet!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast a long time ago and found ourselves out here again for lunch.  While I was not expecting anything fancy or to blow me away I was a little disappointed. Our breakfast last time was good. This time we split a club sandwich, with the chips and I ordered an extra side of sweet potato fries. The chips were super hard and not worth eating and the sweet potatoes were ok. Standard frozen fry fair. Club sandwich was ok. Not exciting, not terrible. You won't be disappointed eating her but you won't be excited either."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Sausage gravy is a must along with the biscuits.  Service is top notch.  Portion are generous, prices are very reasonable.  By the way, it opens at 8:00 am during July and August. Will be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Just plain nasty service and the food was'nt any better. They really need to get their crap together. If you don't know how to serve people then don't and to the \"cooks\" go back to school and learn how to cook a burger."}
{"text":"Wow! Let me say first of all how nice the people who own the business are. Wonderful, they have such positive energy. They were prompt, which wasn't easy since we ordered food for 12. And the food was amazing! I will definitely be back, and I will tell all my friends that when they come out to Dream Racing that we have this great little cafe to eat at!"}
{"text":"The Race Day Cafe, despite the building's rough exterior design, is a pleasant down time spot from the fast-pace speedway. I went with my two brothers and sisters while trekking back to Ohio. And it was well worth the stop! The service was upbeat and punctual; the time between ordering our food and its arrival was minimal.  The food itself was top-tier, with its pleasing presentation and succulent flavors. We all ordered the Thai Tea and it was to die for! It was the best Thai Tea I've ever tasted! Also, I ordered the Make-Your-Own-Burger and it was  the size of my head and SO, SO good! My siblings ordered the roast beef with mashed potatoes, soup and sandwich and cheeseburger respectively. We were all blown away by the yumminess and affordability of the food (each of our entrees were well under $10)! It was so good we even ordered Thai teas, BLT clubs, sweet potato fries, thick-cut potato chips to-go! YUM YUM!  All in all, it was a very enjoyable, very tasteful experience. I recommend it highly for those in the area and those traveling through! The next time I go to Vegas, I'll be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"I'll second the other reviews that tell you to look past the exterior of the building...this cafe is awesome. We came from out of town so the men could do the Mario Andretti Experience thing. Everyone was starving, so we hit up this cafe thanks to the Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and service was great. The sweet potato fries rocked my world and my grilled chicken sandwich was piled high--I swear it had half an avocado on top! If we ever return to the raceway, we'll for sure stop in for a bite. Mmm..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome gourmet food at fast food prices. Can't say enough good about the entire place. Good from start to finish should be more like this. Thanks"}
{"text":"if breakfast is one of your favorite meals you have to order their biscuits and gravy....oh my sorry grandma...the absolute best ever!!"}
{"text":"Any time I order food from here I haven't been let down by the taste or the quality. The atmosphere is great for anyone who is a fan of race day. The only reason for not giving this place 5 stars is due to the price, it can get a little pricey after food and drink."}
{"text":"Great salads and burgers! Fun to watch the cars at Exotic Racing. Staff is friendly and accommodating. We will be back."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is a very good place to eat. We ordered the basic BLT with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries are super good! The food was overall delicious, although it's noisy outside. (I'm pretty sure that the sound barrier was broken a couple times). They allow dogs outside, letting us bring our pooch to the restaurant. He liked the sweet potato fries too! Great service and great food. Five stars for you."}
{"text":"This cafe is a diamond in the rough . Great owners that are there to insure great service . From a long day at the race way, we had a great experience. They turned a bad situation to a better one . I suggest get the country fried steak and eggs ."}
{"text":"The Best home made potato chips. I am a big French fry lover but when I come here for a burger or even a salad, I always get a side of their chips. So Yummyyyyyyy!!!! I bring them home and everyone loves them. Brought a friend who isn't a big chip person, and he ended up eating his own plus half of mine. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Was here visiting for NASCAR 2018 races - I had the Philly Cheese Steak and it was awesome  the hubster had a Turkey Club - both were very yummy  try it you'll love  it"}
{"text":"A little out of the way unless you're headed to Ely, Utah, or a race. Typical diner food. Good quality, good quantity. I've always had pleasant service here. Only stopped for breakfast, but this should be a good lunch stop as well. Open extended hours if there is an event at the speedway complex (you probably wouldn't want to come out here on a race day unless you were going to the race though!)."}
{"text":"Continues to provide great food and service.  One of our regular stops when in the neighborhood.  Friendly atmosphere always makes for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was alright at best, big  helpings but okay at best. We ordered the hamburger and the buffalo chicken wrap, nothing special about either amd will not visit again as a result."}
{"text":"They have 2 people working on the weekend of a major racing event.  They were nice 30 mins after we came in and they finally greeted us. Then, they run out of French fries. How TF in America does this happen.  Literally,  I'm fuming mad but trying not to act like a greedy fat ass.  This place is terrible, they couldn't even get the BLT right. I'm Sitting in the restaurant writing this.  I'm so disappointed.  If i could give zero stars, I would. WTF?"}
{"text":"Being my 4th visit here, I never knew a day like this would come, because I'm not into discouraging customers from trying different businesses.   If you have ever starved from physically working long hours and had something wrong with your order, I'm sure you can relate to this feeling.  This round i decided to choose something a little more on the healthy side so i got the Asian Chicken Salad. Now let me advise you that i had read the ingredients to the salad, including lettuce tomatoes chicken peanuts and some. Longg story short, my salad came out looking good but only one problem.. my lettuce was substituted for shredded cabbage! They tried explaining to me that it was part of the salad but as i showed them in the menu, cabbage was not even listed. I dont know about you, but for sure i can tell the difference between cabbage and lettuce.  Of course I should give them a chance to reveal themselves so I changed my order to an Angus Steak Salad togo instead. I even stated \"With ranch, please\". We pay our bill and head back to work as i attempt to fork down my salad during the 5 minute drive. Turns out they forgot the ranch.. yes i was forced to eat a dry salad and not to mention with the bland sliced sirloin piece of what they call 'steak'.  My coworker also was not pleased with his Chicken Cordon Bleu. For $9 the sandwich was smaller than expected, came with a small cup of coleslaw and was missing avocado on the burger.   Needless to say my expectations here have dramatically changed from 5 to 2.5 stars and dont plan on visiting again for awhile."}
{"text":"Being that this place was right across the street from the Las Vegas Speedway, it only made sense that the decor was race/car related. It has this diner feel in a industrial warehouse feel because it seems to be in a industrial warehouse (haha). The service was great, our waiter was attentive and definitely made conversation with us. She was prompt with bringing us our waters, menus, and food so that was swell.   However, the food wasn't that great. I ordered the philly cheesesteak with their homemade ranch potato chips. The chips were freshly made but lacked flavor. It just tasted like plain potato chips to me. The philly cheesesteak was bland for my taste. A cheesesteak from Capriotti's is way better in comparison to this place. If there was no other place to eat around that area, then I'd go here just cause I don't want to die of starvation but if I had a choice, I would not be going here. It's about $10 or so per item and if I'm going to pay that much, I'd like to enjoy what I'm eating.   This was definitely a miss for me, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices! Came for the sweet potato fries and they did not disappoint! Thick cut fries! Absolutely great! And great Philly cheese steak also."}
{"text":"This Place always has great Food.  I have tried a few dishes and still not disappointed.  Staff is super friendly. im so lucky to work near this place. the veggie Wrap is to die for. and crispy Fries!!!  Salads are super and so is the dressings  yes its a little pricey :(.... but at least u'll be happy with the food FYI.... PLEASE BE patient  (able to accept or tolerate delays, problems, or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious) on \"big event days\" they are busy and do the best they can.  so go early if you can OR call in your order"}
{"text":"Great cafe. Right by the track. It has a decent menue with a large patio perfect for sipping a beverage with a good burger while enjoying the day and listening to the races roar in the distance."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick bite while at the speedway. The brownie shakes & new french fries are delicious. Can be a bit pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"We were a little skeptical when we pulled up because it was totally empty but we were greeted by nice waitresses and for drinks right away. The food was honestly really good and I'm a super picky eater. They got our order right and the price was great."}
{"text":"We stopped in to get breakfast prior to our dune buggy outing. The  place is located in the industrial park at the race way development. Place is decorated with racing memorabilia. Its very clean and service was friendly. Diner style food so nothing fancy. We ordered biscuits over gravy, eggs over easy, hash browns, county fried steak, and grilled steak. Everything was to be expected except the friend county steak was too salty. Thought I gulped a little of the Atlantic ocean for a bit. The server graciously too it off and I reciprocated  with a larger tip. So if your in the mood for some diner style food before trekking to your raceway outing, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decent caf√© tucked out amongst the industrial buildings at the raceway. Service is good, selection is caf√© standard: burgers, sandwiches, breakfast in the morning. I wasn't blown away but it was solid.   I got the chicken sandwich, which was exactly as it sounds but the highlight was it came with avocado. And by avocado they put half of an avocado on the sandwich...not sliced, just the big chunk. I thought that was pretty funny that I had to spread it around."}
{"text":"Cool spot next to the raceway. Busy at lunch on a Tuesday but the servers kept up pretty well. The food was decent cafe food."}
