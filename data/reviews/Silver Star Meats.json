{"text":"Best value in Pittsburgh that I am aware of!  At the Silver Star Deli they slice your choice of meat to order and make you a sandwich on Mancini bread.  I get the corned beef and Swiss on marble rye with deli mustard and ALL IT COSTS IS THREE DOLLARS!!!  I figure the only reason they can do it at this price is that they process the meat next door in their plant.  Seriously, it doesn't get any FRESHER or BETTER than this!  And we're not talking a couple of thin slices of meat like Jimmy Johns or Subway.  THIS is a sandwich!  I you go at noon, be prepared to wait in line (better take your number when you get in the door) because everything is made to order.  It's not fast food, but it is great food.  Did I mention they sell Silver Star Hot Dogs?  Did I mention you can buy packages of meat to take home for dinner?  And the Jenny Lee cinnamon bread."}
{"text":"I grew up eating lunch meat from Silver Star and really is good quality meat. I love to stop in & get a sandwich .. whenever I am out n about.  They have a nice selection of chips and snacks and even baked goods. I love pastrami and they have the best!!    I stopped today to get my boyfriend   capicola and he loved it!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week for lunch for my office. While the prices are really reasonable ($3.50 for a sandwich) the staff is not welcoming. It always seems like they're pissed off at you for being there and they're pissed off at each other for having to be there. And they take forever! You'll be there for a while if you go between 12-1."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cured meats made in old world tradition you need to go here.  I am of Eastern European/Polish decent and grew up on some real interesting foodstuffs.  My grandmother used to make blood kielbasi and we had Braunschweiger sandwiches with mustard on onions on rye that were delicious.  I heard that Silver Star opened up a retail store next to their production facility that offers all the old word recipe meats as well as a variety of cured, sausages, kielbasa, hot dogs, hams and lunch meats, all made next door.   This place does old world recipes for real !!!  They even have Kiska and Souse.  Now that's OLD SCHOOL.  I'm so happy I found this place because all the old recipes seem to fade away with the generations and, It is sure nice to see they are still going strong here.  If you are looking for something new & old to try, pick up some Kiska, it will only set you back about $5.00.  You may find yourself eating it with scrambled eggs, as I do.  Maybe."}
