{"text":"The food was awesome. Do I really need to say more than that?  OK, so since my family is all about take-out lately, I can't review the restaurant's atmosphere, or wait service, but strictly reviewing the food it was a little plate of heaven. Well, make that a big plate.  I ordered the Chicken Sag and Spinach Nan (Yeah, I'm a big spinach fan). The Sag had the wonderfully creamy, soothing taste I was hoping for. That dish is my comfort food. The Nan was freshly baked and piping hot. My husband had the Lamb Vindaloo and Aloo Paratha. The Aloo was slightly underseasoned for me, and my husband always orders things \"hot,\" so the Vindaloo was good, but too pungent for my taste. Not for the faint of heart. The flavor was right on, though.  All the food had the complex and earthy Indian spice combination that I've never been able to recreate at home, but love so much. I'm so jazzed about this place. They're a little out of the way. I would have driven right by them if I hadn't known that they're set back off of the road behind another business (sorry can't recall which one). If you like Indian cuisine definitely go give Mantra Masala a try. Let's keep these guys in business!"}
{"text":"Good food, however, the portions are small.  I go there a few times a months due to the fact its the only Indian food in the SW area which is where I live.  I  really like the chicken tika masala and the malai kofta ; I had some of the appetizers as well and they are all fried and doesn't go very well with my healthy diet.    I would recommend  Mantra Masla if you are in the area and craving some Indian food but I think there are much better restaurants in town such as Mount. Everest.  Hope this review helps."}
{"text":"food is pretty bland. been here a couple times just to make sure i didn't just come on a bad day. There are way better places in Las Vegas for Indian food."}
{"text":"I have eaten my share of Indian food in my life and I must say this is the worst. The tandoori chicken tasted like it was a left over from the day before, very dry like wood. The service is also horrible. We were the only table at 12:30 lunch time and they took for ever to give us the \" not fresh food\"."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food I have ever had, no exaggeration at all.  I came here for the first time last night, I normally phone in my orders and have it delivered. Very nice people, will continually come here. The shrimp curry by far is my absolute favorite, perfect amount of spice and everything I've tried here is very flavorful. I highly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Food is good but to say the portions are small is putting it mildly. Lets say they are insulting. Each entree comes with rice - a tablespoon of rice- we were 4 and had to buy a bowl of rice.  Drinks such as mango lassi or iced tea are between 6 and 8 ounces and not refillable, entree dishes are 1/2 to 2/3 the size of the norm anywhere in the valley. Nan is lacking-rubbery. I guess thats why @7 on a Friday night there were to tables occupied (including ours) and one couple at the door. The check is normally for services rendered here its more like a charitabke contribution."}
{"text":"good food, good prices and good atmosphere - all adds up to more than just good. try the \"unnumbered\" lunch special....13 bucks gets you a whole heap of tastes!"}
{"text":"I've always seen this place when I drive by the area and was always hesitant to try it. My roommate whom is Indian both decided to give it a try, and I must say it was delicious! Definitely the Chicken Korma, it's too die for. There was no other customers when we were there, and it seemed like they did not have any business. Most of their business is through catering for the Casino's, etc...  They are only from 5-10pm, and it's a bit hot in there because they don't turn on the A/C. Other than that, I definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me... But i thought it was a little pricey for the amount of chicken tikka masala (plus small side rice). I ordered with no spice since I was also feeding a toddler. It was really sweet. I wasn't too fond of it. I'll try with the usual spicy next time for the real taste. To be honest, I've had better, tastier non-spicy tikka masala elsewhere. I'll still come back to try other dishes.  Since this is an \"express take-out\" I was expecting it to be that, with food made, laid out and ready for the staff to scoop into an entree box... But it's not.  The place was really hot. No AC. Maybe they're still working on it? It felt better standing outside. Small place, not many choices on the menu. The cashier/waiter/cook was nice. Doors didn't open on time at the hour. I had to call after giving them a few mins. They could improve presentation of the place by blocking the very open view leading to the back. But it's good to see the cook washing his hands after handling money :)"}
{"text":"Both I and my wife were  very, very disappointed by lie bestowed upon us by server of Mantra Masala, when we visited Mantra Masala yesterday, the 9th of October 2014 We had ordered kulfi and kheer. What was served was vanilla ice cream and  something which resembled and tasted like reheated porridge. When we spoke to server he insisted that what he had served was kulfi. When I told him that I had taken kulfi dessert throughout my life and that I would recognize kulfi when presented to me he backed down and accepted that what he served was not kulfi but vanilla ice cream and that he was not being truthful.  After this lie, I did not want to speak with him about reheated porridge like item served as kheer. Not only did he not apologize but also billed both deserts. The lie was conduct unbecoming.  If we were naive, unsuspecting clients, he would have taken us for a ride. This experience was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Been here a few times when I get a craving for chicken tandori with mango chutney.  The chicken is always tender and sauce flavorful.  I always leave with my food craving satisfied.  Food is delicious, yet service can improve...overall it's a \"slightly-better-than-ok\" neighborhood Indian restaurant. (I'm sure that'll make sense to some lol)  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Close to our house and great food. Must try the eggplant bharta and the chicken tikka masala. Two of the best dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Okay so this is the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas and all of the states (yes, Boston are included). Here's why: 1. Gorgeous decorum- nothing kitch or subpar here; private dining booths are the most romantic in the ornately woodworked dining area. 2. Impeccable service. We have been here four times so far and have had the same server, he provides an upscale dining experience with a level of class and respect that took us aback at first. Casual attire and highly affordable, this place makes you feel valued every time. 3. Awesome food! Always cooked to perfection; we usually order Samosas and Pagdi Chat ( sort if a citrus, fresh and healthy take on nachos is the only way we've come to describe it to people), Garlic and spinach naan, Chicken Tikka Masala and Sag Paneer. Portions are excellent! you see a relatively small dish initially but soon find that it feels never ending.  4. extensive wine selection accompanied by a proper presentation always puts the icing on our healthy and flavorful meals. 5. Spice range is well explained and the raita is a great balancer. EAT HERE ASAP. We are in love :)  Total bill for items listed above before the wine was $43. seriously, amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst indian place I have been to in a while. No flavor in any dishes- when selecting a spice level of 7/10, you would expect some taste in a dish. The chicken tikka tandoori was horrible,  it smelled as if something was rotting. most indian restaurants marinate chicken well, this one seems to have bypassed that stage altogether"}
{"text":"The food of this small Indian restaurant is very flavorful. I especially love the Chicken Masala and their Garlic Naan. The service is slow paced, which was okay for us as we were looking for a relaxing evening without the feeling of being rushed through our meal.  I give this restaurant a 3 star only because they delivered a food item to our table that was not ours. It took us 15 minutes to get the servers attention. Once he noticed that the item was dropped at the wrong table he picked it up off of our table and brought it to the correct table. The truly disgusting part is that we had taken a bite of the item before realizing that it was not what we had ordered."}
{"text":"Good Honest Food! My wife and I are both vegetarians and really enjoy the vegetarian menu.  Every time we go we have good service and great food. I have never had anything to complain about."}
{"text":"First timer, the customer service was awesome! The garlic nan was great. We had the lamb curry and chicken curry. Both we okay, I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past few months and both times it has been excellent. The Malai Kofta was particularly good and the samosas excellent. Our service was top-notch both times, with the server frequently refilling our waters and checking on the food. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff pleasant and attentive. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"They need to add dark chicken curry to their menu."}
{"text":"Went to this southwest area restaurant for some Indian cuisine. I must first admit that I have only eaten Indian food one other time in my life. However, the friend that I brought with me is very knowledgeable about what to order and what to expect as she has been to India several times. We enjoyed the Samosas and dip which was very good. We also enjoyed chicken tikka masala, vegetable jalfrezi, basmati rice and garlic naan. All were very delightful & there was nothing left over, that's for sure. We ordered the wonderfully refreshing Masala Chai. It went down great on a cold winter's night. Our service was friendly, attentive & very eager to explain anything that we had questions about. The ambience at the restaurant was perfect for relaxing and enjoy some Indian music in the background.i will definitely go back to this establishment as there were a number of items in the menu that caught my eye."}
{"text":"We love this place! Try the Aloo Tikka - a great appetizer of potato cakes with sauce that my boyfriend tries to lick off the plate. The Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent, as is the curry."}
{"text":"This review is more about the experience than the food. I ordered the Veggie Basil Curry. Now when I order something with that title I assume it will consist of mostly vegetables and a few other things maybe. Well imagine my surprise when I get home with my takeout, open the container and find a couple tomatoes 1 piece of potato and the rest is all beans, meaning everything in it was a legume. Due to the fact that I can not eat legumes at ALL right now, I could not partake in what smelled fantastic. I just wish I had known that it was not actually vegetables, and I would have simply ordered a different menu item."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Food was expensive and flavorless. I was tricked by the 5 star reviews and deeply regret wasting money at this place. I only hope that I don't also get food poisoning. Only time will tell. Worst Indian food in Vegas and worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"Be careful when you order the tikki Marsala, I had found feathers in the sauce... I'm not coming back .."}
{"text":"xtra spicy vindaloo & tikka masala are really good"}
{"text":"We were looking for some good food near our new apt and found this place on Yelp. We had a bit of trouble finding it, it's behind a fast food restaurant kind of tucked away.  It was really worth the effort though.  It has a great atmosphere and the service is personal.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I beleive the guy attended to us was the owner or chef and he had great suggestions.  Forgive me as I can't remember names of dishes but they were all flavorful and as Indian food should be vibrant and aromatic.  We enjoyed our appetizer and dinner very much.  I would suggest this place to anyone looking for Indian food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Way better than Origin India-no attitude (in fact the waitress was really nice) and not overpriced. The lunch combo is a great idea. You can try 3 dishes on the same plate and it comes with soup and nan. Didn't miss a buffet at all.  Everything was delicious, nothing was oily, greasy nor gristle-y.Got in and out within 35 minutes which is exactly what I want in a lunch place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to in Las Vegas . This place is always quite, perhaps it's the location  hidden in a corner of a strip mall  or maybe the prices are higher than the average for Indian food. However, if you like quality not quantity and respect that quality cost more  than this is the  place for you. Note the chef doesn't use a lot of Oil and Focuses on a healthier version of Indian cooking ."}
{"text":"Very authentic Indian restaurant. Really enjoyed the food but nothing out of this world to die for. The interior decor along with the choice of music could have matched the restaurant theme very well. Very pleasing experience all around."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and the food is very bland. Definitely won't be ordering from here again. I had the lamb vindaloo and it was borderline watery. It was takeout so I tried salting it but even salt couldn't make it that appetizing. I also had garlic naan with papadam with mango chutney and achar. Altogether my bill was $30. If you want good Indian food go down the road to Saffron. It's more affordable and lots of more flavor."}
{"text":"The food lacked flavor and was really bland!!!  I had the tandoori chicken and my wife had some type of masala. Both dishes didn't look the right and didn't have the right seasoning or taste. It's was a big disappointment, especially since she is pregnant and craves good Indian food.    My wife and I have been very fortunate to have Indian friends in LA show us great food, so we think we can tell what is good and what isn't. The only nice thing is the service was good. I should have known something was wrong when there were on four people ( two couples) including my wife and I."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambience and  friendly wait staff, but manager needs some anger management skills.  We were having a wonderful dinner and asked the waiter to leave the drink menu.  Shortly afterward, the manager came by in a hurry and snatched it up off our table.  He then screamed at our waiter for not removing it earlier.  As the waiter stumbled with words, we interrupted and explained to the manager that we had asked that the drink menu stay.  He apologized to us and then continued to berate the waiter for not letting him know our request.  The manager also had a nasty habit of berating the wait staff on the dining room floor, in front of customers.  We were sitting on the opposite side of the dining room and could easily hear him.  We would have had a wonderful time, if the manager didn't make us feel so uncomfortable for being there.  What an awful way to treat your help."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading about it here. It did not disappoint. We tried Aloo Tikki which has bold yet pleasant flavors. Barah Kabab was also tasty, but it was the Chicken Mantra that we most enjoyed. The  Ras Malai was delicious, too. Our server was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"The perfect chicken tikka masala I have had in a long time. Slight tinge of sweetness to the spiciness. Was heavenly with the garlic naan."}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise! The complexity of the spices used in their sauces is a culinary treat I haven't experienced for awhile. This is the type of meal eaten slowly to really appreciate the layering of flavors. Served with hot nan bread and rice to soak up the sauce. The restaurant itself is quiet, nicely decorated with soothing Indian music in the background."}
{"text":"The place had horrible lighting and the place just seemed dingy. The waitress was nice, but we were the only ones in the restaurant which makes me a little weary. The food was overpriced for the quality that you received. I LOVE indian food and this place was way under expectation and my standard. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food, very tasty, place is very nice and intimate inside. Place looks closed and dark from the outside, but they are open, they just have curtains blocking the windows. Portions could definitely be a little more for the price, but it was good."}
{"text":"OMG... the food is amazing, and the owner is so nice.   I'm a vegan and he's always very careful with the order... my fave"}
{"text":"Forget the location....it is non descript, but the food.....wow, amazing food, you can detect the different spices used and there is little to no oil. The selection on the menu is not extensive, but ask the Chef if you want something that is not listed. They do not rush you and service is is okay. i owuld recoemmend this palce for good Indian cuisine. Try the mango lassi....to  die for....flavorful, tasty and refreshing."}
{"text":"I have eaten Indian food all over the world and this place is HANDS DOWN the worst Indian food I have ever eaten.  The service was non-existent.  In our opinion they don't eve deserve one star. We could not even finish our meals (I only ate a few bites) it was so bad.  If this place has won awards I question who the critics are.  Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"I lean closer to 3.5 stars then 4, but they don't give you that option.   I honestly, will get food to go again if I don't feel like driving across town, to go eat in at an Indian restaurant.   Chicken tikka masala, and chicken curry was actually really good.   We asked for extra rice, because the rice portions are small. However, we had enough leftovers for two more meals the next day.   There are only two negatives which is why I lean more towards 3.5 stars.   1. The naan was very disappointing. It had good flavor, but for my taste needed more garlic. It was also very rubbery, dry, and a little burnt. They need to work a little better on their naan.  2. For take out, and quick express Indian food it is a little pricy. For one order of chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, naan, and extra rice cost us about $45.00. I think it was worth it, but I feel for a take out restaurant it should be a little less in price.   Overall, I definitely recommend those two dishes if you are craving Indian food in the Centennial area, and don't feel like eating in anywhere or driving far."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Got chicken tikka masala and garlic naan...20$...I stopped eating because I'm super picky about meat and the chicken was weird random pieces unclear what was going on(I almost feel like some wasn't even chicken)...I like clean meat that has no extra ufo stuff attached to it and that's not what I saw :("}
{"text":"Good food.  Never oily and has great flavors.  Curry has a little heat to it, which is nice.  Fresh nan.    Very intimate little restaurant, perfect for lunch discussions with colleagues or a nice dinner date.  Service is a little hit & miss, but it doesn't take away from the quality of the experience overall."}
{"text":"Getting the food took quite a bit longer than than they said it would be, and it was extremely hot waiting inside.   The food was really delicious, but very pricey. The chicken tikka masala was a container full of sauce with a few small chunks of chicken and a small container of rice. I'd have expected to pay under $10 for that amount. Maybe the lunch specials are where it's at!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with 4 other friends a few nights ago... The food was great. The service... well it wasn't intentionally bad I think but it was definitely lackluster. Immediately upon sitting we ask for 5 glasses of water. He brings 2 glasses, with no ice, 10 minutes later. We ask for ice, 3 mango lassis and a coke. 10 minutes later out come 1 mango lassi and 1 coke... still no ice and still missing 1 mago lassi and 3 waters. This is 30 minutes into sitting down. It definitely was not because they were swamped... there was only 1 other table seated in the restaurant. he eventually brought us the remaining beverages and took our order. We all ordered Chicken Tikka MArsala with varying levels of spice but what we got was Chicken Tikka Marsala all at medium level. It was plain to see that they just made one batch and tried to pass it off. At $15 a plate just for the Marsala... this is unacceptable. Actually, as I'm writing this review I'm deducting another star. 1 star for you Mantra Marsala. What poor service!"}
{"text":"The food & service here are as good as it gets!! Delicious, authentic, warm & kind waitstaff... I say go for it!! :)"}
{"text":"they say delivery on the website but when you call, they say go to uber eats. i will never go here again."}
{"text":"I love Indian food but the price for take out is not worthy for me to return.  The tikka masala is delicious but they give you too little rice and then ask if you would like more rice at a crazy price added to the already high price!   The take out containers they use melt inside your food so half the top of the rice we had to throw away!  I am very disappointed with the price and quantity and quality of their cheap plastic containers!  Most likely not returning unless they change!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed with the food here. Stopped in recently for lunch & the place was absolutely dead. No other tables were being occupied at right around 12pm is not a good sign. I had been here once before a few years ago so I knew they had lunch specials. We were given the regular menu & had to ask for lunch menus. I over heard another table that came in after us ask for lunch menus later on as well so I don't think they automatically give them to you as they want you to order off the higher price menu. Ordered off the lunch special & got the Chicken Tikka & Dewane Handi as it came as a combination meal that also had a soup, naan & basmati rice with it. The basmati rice was dry & stuck together in a way that it would seem that it was quite possibly rice from the day before. The Chicken Tikka was ok but needed more sauce on it. Only 3 small pieces of chicken on the plate which was a bit disappointing. The Dewane Handi was just ok. I had to put more salt on it to get the flavor to pop a bit. Naan was just ok. The soup (some kind of curry I think) was actually really good. But I am not going back for just the soup. Have eaten at other Indian restaurants in town that had more flavor."}
{"text":"Started off with an appetizer (papdi chat & garlic naan) then had the chicken curry(mild) because my friend and I were sharing since he's never tried Indian food before and \"can't take the heat\" lol . I LOVE LOVE LOVE spicy so he brought out a spicy chutney on the side  that tasted AMAZING!! Last, for dessert he brought out a combo of AWESOME pistachio ice cream (I don't really like pistachio ice cream) and GULAB JAMUN. This tasted EXACTLY as I remembered when I had it yearrrrs ago with my dad living in SF. We finished EVERY little bite and felt good doing so knowing nothing was cooked with oil. ;) this place will def. be our go to Indian fix.. The service was great as well.. I think they really took away from other reviews because the service was pretty fast! Next time were trying the chicken tikka masala!"}
{"text":"I ate with Brenda L on the same exact day, and we happened to be at the same table eating the same thing!  haha!  Anyhoo, I think I totally had a different opinion of the food maybe because we had split all the dishes and they gave the birthday girl (me) the better cooked dishes?   1.   Mussels Mantra - i thought that the mussels that I had were actually really juicy and tender.  And the sauce!  Oh the sauce!  I totally wanted to mop it all up with the naan! 2.  Padpi Chat - i didn't love this dish but i appreciated the tangy flavors and the crunchy bread 3.  Sea bass - I thought this was actually overcooked and dry 4.  Chicken Tikka Masala - i had the specially prepared one with extra spiciness.  loved it and it was not dry 5.  Lamb Mantra - i enjoyed this dish a lot because it was actually really tender and not gamey at all 6.  Dewane Handi - this spinach dish did not impress me much, and nor did I even remember eating it!  haha!   Out of everything, the sea bass was my least favorite, and my favorites were between the tender lamb and the fluffy yet crusty nan bread!  So good!  From what I've experience, Indian food is always pricier than other foods, but I had such a good experience, I guess the price was fine to me.    Conclusion:  I'm sorry that Brenda L did not have as good of an experience as I did, but I was a happy camper!  Going back for more."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the chicken tikka masala, potatoe cakes with a yogurt sauce and the regular nan. The chicken comes with rice. It was enough food for me to share with my mom and have some left over for work the next day. I ordered medium heat on the curry and that was quiet spicy (and I can handle spicy). It was a bit a pricey for one order of food but filled my Indian food craving."}
{"text":"The garlic nan was delicious to start off with and the chicken curry and lamb mantra were excellent. I'll be ordering to go next time and enjoy the food at home bc the service awful."}
{"text":"So me and my girlfriend decided to order from here. I was shocked and appalled at their food quality. Their food tasted watered down and bitter. This is not authentic indian food in anyway. Im sure the chef is not anywhere close to indian either. $60 in take out and all we felt is sick and angry. Mixed grill is the biggest joke of all, garlic naan is like garlic chips and the guy on the phone didn't know what keema naan is!!!!! Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Never really enjoyed this type of cuisine but it's my wife's favorite. So after eating here multiple times I really enjoyed it. So one night my wife (4 months pregnant) called for an order to-go at 9:45pm (and they close at 10) they were more than welcoming to complete our order and when I arrived 20 min later they were extremely nice and happy to have the business! Food was amazing and will come back over and over for my new found style of food and welcoming business."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas by far!  We have tried most of their menu items and everything is prepared well - the lamb is tender as is the chicken.  They are able to prepare dishes with great flavors that are not nearly as spicy as most Indian food.  The Lamb Mantra & Chicken Sag are favorites as are the Onion Kulcha & Garlic Naan.  Prices are very reasonable - we always bring home enough for a 2nd meal."}
{"text":"Loved, loved this place. This review is purely based on the food as the service was not good. The food however was pure flavor and absolutely worth going back for. YUM, YUM, YUM"}
{"text":"Cant believe i've been living in the general area for months and never seen this place. I found it due to the taco bell on a day i was in a hurry to get to point B.   One thing that really surprised me was the price of everything. Sucks when you're a penny pinching college student who's hungry as hell. Regardless i asked for a chicken tandoori. The cook was handling my order and recommended i get the day's special instead which was only 13.95. Being hungry i didn't care and the faster i can pay results in the faster my food arrived.  Chicken...Special (13.95) I'd never thought i'd be using this word to describe Indian food but here it goes, This dish was a bit bland at first. Not bland as in lacking flavor, it had plenty of that. A few heavy pinches of kosher salt fixed it right up. No clue what it was called but it was hardy with a rich flavorful sauce, large cuts of tomatoes, onions, and the deboned chicken.   Garlic Nan Very strong garlic presence. nice and coarse hunks of garlic on top of the nan. Could have been crispier. It was a bit soggy but could have been from the to go bag.  Overall this place is pretty good and with it's close location it can easily become a regular for me. From 11am - 2pm is their lunch specials and dishes are advertised at or around 6 dollars."}
{"text":"Maybe it's meant to be more authentic, but this is the first Indian joint I've eaten at that didn't make their tikka masala with chicken breast cut into bite size pieces. They were very fatty large chunks of chicken thighs. The sauce was kind of runny and light on flavor. The prices are way too high as well. Just seemed like it was made with as cheap of chicken as possible. I'm not knocking dark meat, I love me some chicken thighs and there may have been some white meat in there but there was so much fat on it that it was difficult to eat and tell.  Such a bummer because my wife and I love Indian food but this is the only one in this area. Sucks because we ordered delivery via stub hub so that I didn't have to leave the house tonight, but instead I have to put my outside clothes to go get something else and we wasted 50 bucks.  To put this review into perspective, I felt compelled to do so under the assumption that posting on Yelp is the dorkiest thing I could possibly do and I hope the restaurant owner takes this feedback as an opportunity to adjust his selection of chicken used to appeal more to the masses instead of those looking for something more authentic. Authentic doesn't pay the bills. The masses do."}
{"text":"Here's my short review...  - Ordering was a chore - The food smelled old - The food was bland - Don't go here - Go to Curry Leaf Flavors of India on Ft. Apache  Hers my long review...  I didn't know Mantra Masala existed so I was stoked to find an Indian restaurant so close to where I live.   I called to place a pick up order and the guy taking my order seemed like he was on another planet. It wasn't a language barrier issue either.   He got my name wrong at least ten times. I knew I was really in for it when I started ordering the food. I asked how many samosas were in one order and he said \"one\", so I said I will have four samosas thinking I would get four samosas with my order. I got home and opened the carton to see eight samosas. There are two samosa per order so I spent loads of money on some vegetables wrapped in fried dough.  Then I ordered a paneer dish a curry dish and onion kulcha bread. It literally took this guy five minutes to figure out what I wanted. I could hear him flipping through the menu trying to figure out what I was ordering. After a while, I heard another guy rip the phone out of the first guys hands to get my order in properly.   I skeptically drove to pick up the order. It was ready for me and I paid. Thankfully there was no issue with picking up the food or paying.   I got home, opened up my order and everything looked good, but the contents smelled musty. You know, like an epically old crazy lady's home smell? Yeah, like that.   The samosas were huge. They tasted ok. My paneer and curry dishes were bland. How can that could happen with Indian food??? How can Indian food be bland???!!!  The rice was dry and yellow. This was the first Indian place where I was served yellow rice. It's usually white rice.   The onion kulcha? Well, let's not even talk about that. *barf*  The food sucked and I had double the amount of samosa that I ordered. The only things I liked were the chutneys that came with the samosa.   I literally threw everything out but the samosa because I was so friggin hungry.   Do yourself a favor. Drive the extra few miles and eat the delicious Indian food at Curry Leaf Flavors of India on Ft. Apache Rd.  The food there is fantastic! The service is on point too.   Sorry, Mantra Masala. I thought I found a gem, but I didn't. I found a crazy old lady's musty smelling couch in a bag with eight samosas  Love, Me"}
{"text":"Ordered through BiteSquad. The tikka chicken was very dry and it was burned, the lamb vindaloo had very tough meat with sauce that lacked flavor oand was watery. The chicken biryani was very spicy, when I had requested that it be mild. The overall experience in eating this food was terrible. Even the naan was soggy and old. The only thing we ate was the basmati rice (which was very small in portion size,) which was not that bad. The yogurt sauce was watery and very sour.  I don't think we will ever give this place a chance, not even for the buffet. I don't know who to talk to about this, bitesquad or the restaurant. I don't think BiteSquad should even deliver this food, it was the worst indian food I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"WORST INDIAN FOOD EVER!!!!! Seriously gross and does not even resemble Indian flavors. Should have known when the staff wasn't even Indian. DONT NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"}
{"text":"This place was unbearably hot and felt very muggy. Naan bread was the best! Had the chicken tikka Masala and made the mistake of not ordering it spicy because it lacked flavor and tasted bland and boring. We ordered sauce on the side that was absolutely delicious and apparently it was the sauce that's normally on that dish. When we asked for more to dip our naan bread in, the waiter was annoyed. Ordered a few appetizers not worth remembering. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Mantra Masala is proof that I'm a bad girl and someone wants to punish me.  This is the only Indian option on my (southwest) side of town, and it's surely just about the only Indian restaurant without a buffet. The cruelty!  (They had a buffet for about five minutes a few summers ago. Eight dishes, heavy on the okra, heavy on the management's voiced opinion that it wasn't cost effective to run a buffet.)   For a long time I thought the lack of Indian buffet in my stretch of the valley was just meanness on the universe's part, even though the taste of Mantra Masala's food - be it dine-in or carry-out - was never really above three stars. I know they market themselves as \"healthy\" cuisine, and I suppose it shows.  But we finally called it quits on our frequent take-aways after paneer portions became more and more skimpy, naan often ended up kind of burned or tasteless, and we realized that there was a lot of \"miss\" and not really a single \"hit\" to justify being *that* lazy. Sometimes you just have to shrug and order a pizza instead.  I don't know how Mantra Masala has managed to survive - maybe they do because they're the only option out here - but if they're looking for more customers (and if the parking lot is any indication, surely they are), I beg them to consider the following:  1. Drop the healthy angle. It tastes weird.   2. Become a copycat of the successful Indian restaurants elsewhere in Las Vegas. I can't believe I'm advocating unoriginality, but at this point I just want to be able to get some solid, good Indian food near home. Being a copycat includes copying the proportions - no more skimping on paneer cubes!  3. Do a lunch buffet with some interesting angle. (This is where you should get creative.) Maybe a really wide range of desserts? No one else seems to play that up. Live music? Dance? Yeah, I know the old lunch buffet didn't work, and maybe it's because the population is more sparse out here, but it also was a boring buffet of limited items. (We looked over every dish, apologized, and left.) Maybe not every day, but at least run a buffet on weekends.  4. Cooking classes. DO THEM NOW. I have begged Indian restaurants across the valley to offer these and everyone just laughs politely and nothing happens. Here's a way to sell the buffet, too - as in, come for the buffet and get X amount off the cooking class immediately afterward. I know so many people who've expressed interest in learning how to cook Indian food, and at best we get the odd demo here and there. No one is doing this.   Offer hands-on classes on Saturday afternoons, just after the buffet, and change the topic every week. Gulab jamun class? I'm there. Naan in a home-oven class? Enrolled. Buttery paneer for the gringo soul? Let me BE the valedictorian!  (Note: Um, but you need to do steps 1 and 2 first, okay? I don't want to learn how to cook what you currently have going on.)  5. Explore the hipster space. Chutney tasting hour with matched cocktails? Bollywood pajama parties? Loaner saris at the door for those who want to get in the spirit?  6. Update your website. Turmeric has been the \"Spice of the Moment\" for, literally, years, and you don't even serve the kind of food where people are happy to walk away with turmeric-stained fingers. How about online ordering for take-away?  Mantra Masala, I'm sharing these ideas because I want some tasty Indian near my home. Right now you're providing meh food at ambitious prices. Please fix this. I want to cheer for the home team. RAH RAH RAH! GIMME KOR-MA!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place. Everything was delicious, would definitely recommend the lamb korma curry and the tandori chicken. The rice pudding was excellent. I know rice pudding is normally just pudding, but this had something extra. Food tastes \"clean\" not overly greasy, heavy, or huge portions."}
{"text":"Welcoming and Nice Service. Food is too Expensive for the Taste.I would not rate this as the best Indian restaurant in Vegas. Its just one among many. so if you live close by there is nothing wrong to try this one. I am some one who give more value to the taste of the food than decoration so i am giving only 2 stars as i have experienced better places than this one."}
{"text":"Although I had my doubts about Mantra Masala before actually eating there (the sign on the exterior says \"healthy\" Indian food, leading me to imagine creamless plates of Tikka Masala - ew) I was pleasantly surprised once I actually had the opportunity to eat there.  The service was friendly and fast and the food was great.  We had the appetizer sampler (fried goodness), Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, garlic naan bread and we split a mango lassie.   It was a little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants that I've been to, but it is close to my house and I will definitely go there again when I'm craving Indian.  One complaint I would have is that it took not one, not two, but THREE visits to the establishment before I could eat there due to their weird schedule.  Closed on Mondays.  Closed during the afternoon during their off-peak hours.  I get that it saves them money to close during this time, but this is Vegas and I would expect a restaurant to be open at 3 p.m."}
{"text":"I've tried 3 different Indian restaurants in town and this place is by far my favorite ! Little pricey for a hole in the wall but it's delicious and the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food! Start off with Popi-chat for an app. Then grab the Chicken Tikka Marsala with two orders of Naan Bread with and extra side of rice! Then finish it off with the most amazing desert....  Not sure what it is called but the owner made it for me.  It has two scoops of his he made pasatico ice cream and this amazing little warm ball of something....  OMG!  It belongs in a spa!  Not sure why but every time you take a bite (combine the two) it has this amazing taste that brings you back to a relaxing spa!  Enjoy!  I normally go once a week!"}
{"text":"Came here because it was close to where we live. The food was horrible. My wife and I are avid Indian food lovers. The prices are too high and the quality of food is not up to par. Ordered chicken tikka masala and veggie khurma.  The masala tasted watered down. The khurma had no taste and had strange veggies in it for the dish like green beans. Couldn't call this place authentic. Would not recommend to others. My 2 cents. The search for a good Indian food restaurant continues for my wife and I. This was the first place in Vegas we tried."}
{"text":"This location was more built as a to go type of restaurant. The food is worth the money!! Had the chicken tikka masala, it tasted so good. I haven't had good Indian food in awhile. Definitely will come back here again."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to try several of the Vegetarian dishes from Mantra Masala and have not tasted one I did not like.  I might prefer one over another but all of them are loaded with flavor that keep me wanting to explore the rest of the menu.    One of my favorites is the Channa Masala.  This dish is made with garbonzo beans, tomato, potato, onion and flavored with roasted cumin.  I cannot get enough of this dish, I would eat this every day.  The Channa is served with a side of rice but the portion of this dish for this price can easily feed two people.   I have also tried Aloo Gobi...very delicious with the cauliflower I my favorite way to eat this vegetable now.  The Mutter Paneer is also the best way to eat peas besides chicken pot pie.  The Dewane Handi is also very flavorful.  Any one of these dishes will tantalize your taste buds.    I am a new fan of Mantra Masala from the first dish I tasted it keeps me coming back to try something else.  This location is a takeout only location with only two tables for waiting and I am sure they would not mind if you sat enjoyed right in the small dining area.  I hear they have a fine dining location in the southwest on Warm Springs and Durango which I have not visited but might make the pilgrimage soon to pay my respects to the chef who creates this authentic Indian Cuisine.    Do not forget to get the fresh made Nan bread.  The Garlic Cilantro Nan is amazing.  The mint sauce that accompanies this traditional food is so refreshing and unique I could drink it by the gallon.    I was very satisfied with my visits to Mantra Masala.  This take out only location is very convenient for me to call in an order and pick it up after the long drive home from work."}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian restaurant!!!! Very consistent... every time we eat there, there are no surprises. Fresh ingredients, exceptional flavor..."}
{"text":"I had the Mantra Masala Mixed Grill and my wife ordered the Mutter Paneer. The spices used for both dishes were excellent. The Garlic Nan was very flavorful along with the tamarind sauce they give you. The one downfall to this place are the prices - pretty high in price for a take-out restaurant. When I'm in the mood for Indian food again, chances are I'll go to a sit-in restaurant since they at least give water to drink while you wait. Plus I wouldn't feel as bad paying more to be served. Recommend dropping the prices to obtain more business. HINT: Don't always expect top, quality cuisine from a take-out joint...I guess that's why I liked this place? Or maybe it was just that good..."}
{"text":"North Durango location: they opened a month ago and it was worth the wait. It's carry out only and I think it's a bit pricey but the food is good. This is the only Indian Cuisine on the NW side of town; I will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food on this side of town. Flavors are exceptional and lots to choose from. It's never busy or crowded and makes for a peaceful evening out.  Favorites:samosa Garlic naan Lamb biryani Malai kofta  I wish I could give 5 stars, but service is always a bit slow and you constantly feel like you're trying to get someone's attention."}
{"text":"Good Indian cuisine. The service is great, the food is also good especially since it isn't the typical greasy style that some Indian food can be. Be sure to have the samosas and the potato chaat on the appetizer menu!"}
{"text":"Just had chicken biriyani at this stupid indian restaurant. Very average food. Ridiculously overpriced. Highest prices for any indian restaurant across America. Charged me $3 for Pickle which is given free in every indian restaurant. This restaurant is meant to rob customers. Complete avoid."}
{"text":"I love the food here and I bring my family and friends  every chance I get. Hopefully they will make this place a sit down restaurant rather than a to go place but the food is ready in a reasonable amount of time. Portions are generous. it is in my neighborhood too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice; once for dinner and once for lunch.   The place is nice and secluded in a little plaza. The restaurant has a very nice mood to it. The colors are very warm and the decorations are artsy, which is expected of an Indian restaurant.   The food and the service is both mediocre. The staff just seems a little bored and lack enthusiasm.   The lunch specials are cheap, all under $10 from what I can remember and include soup.   The portions are decent and the food seems pretty healthy. I did feel like the food lacked some flavor though. My boyfriend got the tikka masala and I forgot what I ordered, but I tried his and it tasted kind of bland.   Over all, I don't think I'd come back unless I was in the area and wanted a cheap lunch special."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian.  Get it on the Southwest side of town. Very good across the board!  Delicious naan, excellent curries, vindaloo...  It's not cheap but the food is great. I have, on multiple occasions, had the owner come out and ask what I think about his restaurant. I should clarify, the prices are great, but the portions aren't enormous, but, I'll tell you what, this place knocks the socks off of Gaylords, Ghandi's and any other authentic Indian place i have had in town."}
{"text":"A very quaint and intimate place to experience authentic Indian food. It had been years since I last tried Indian food and thanks to a special friend who is a regular at Mantra Massala, I was able to order with confidence and enjoy a great meal. I was pleased with the level of spices in the dishes. The service was at a slower pace than most other establishments, but it set the tone for the evening. No need to rush your meal, just sit back and relax. I loved the authentic dishes and silverware our meals were served on as well as the decor. I was a bit apprehensive about ordering too spicy of a meal, but I am happy to report that the next morning my tummy is feeling fine.  I encourage you to try Mantra for yourself I think you will be pleased."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I have to to be able to rate the business. Ayayay where do I start ???  \"Veggie\" khorma had legumes in it and tasted nothing like a khorma.. no cauliflower, no potatoes, no green peas... -_-  Chicken tikka Masala was heavy in cream...lacking spices.. cream is cheaper than spices  Rice portion was a 3oz dish (from a nearby Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino ((yes we flipped it over))) -_- my husband is 6'5 280lb. (we've never had this prob anywhere else)  Raita (yogurt) portion was more than the rice, but it had water mixed in and the seasoning was way off...no cumin, too much  anise seeds, no cucumbers or carrots or spices  Food was yucky, expensive, and miniature.   No buffet?!?!?! wtf? that's like an indian rest. staple  OH AND...WE COMPLAINED TO THE WAITER, HE SAID OWNER WILL BE IN LATER... and there was nothing he could do....as we were leaving, the owner came and our waiter told him our problem...he said give me a min...my husband said we're obviously not important enough so we left and I'm now venting on here... shoulda' caught me at the door buddy-boy!  A bit of background ... I've probably ate at more Indian restaurants around the world than anything else.  I had an indian restaurant cater my 150 party indian-themed bridal shower - (restaurant sales went up 20% in the following 6 weeks because my guests loved their food)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place.... I really did... but after we placed our order of two entrees and an appetizer, and it came to $50... I was done with place....  You cannot eat here, which is no biggie, but theres only two tables for people to sit and eat at if they wanted to, or wait for their food.   The entrees come with rice but it isnt even enough.. There aren't enough portions for the price you pay.. It would have been cheaper for me to buy and make the food on my own at home.. and it would taste better!   There is WAY too much cilantro in the food, in every single dish... I got 4 small mussels in my mussels appetizer.. The lamb was mealy in my lamb manta.  I wanted to finish my food just because of how much I paid for it, but it doesn't taste good....   One thing too, when we got home, none of the food bowls were labeled so we had to do taste tests to figure out whose was whose instead of just taking a second and writing on the lid what what was...   I wanted so badly to love this place but the price, the food, the lack of rice and portions etc.. I just can't... I will take the menu though, and look up the recipes and make them at home so that is a good thing?   I hope that this place gets better because i want to give it a second try but not for the price!!! For $50, I expected as much food as I get at the chinese restaurant for $30 across the street!"}
{"text":"This place food is a little better on taste. However Indian food always tends to be on the over priced side. But this place was way over priced and the portions were way too small. Listen to what I'm saying REALLY SMALL PORTIONS paid about $50 and didn't even leave full and only two diff on trays. But food was ok."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian restaurant in our neiborhood, SW. I think this restaurant is ome of the better Indian restaurants in Las Vegas. Great neiborhood restaurant to satisfy ur appetite. My husband had Lamb Korma and it was very good and my Chicken Tikka Masala is very good, as well. I never have a craving for Indian Food so we don't visit here often but whenever we do, it doesn't disappoint us.   Naan here are very good but Paratha are just okay.    One thing that did bother me this time is that the girl, the server?, did not offer a lunch menu, which we didn't know it existed. Same thing that I ordered could have been $5 less. It made me feel that I was screwed over. SO! I highly suggest you to ASK for a lunch menu because they were not offering unless customers asked."}
{"text":"The chef really cares about the food he puts out. It's delicious, and the environment is so serene. Makes me want to nap after I eat like a piglet :-)"}
{"text":"garlic nan = yummy tikka masala = yummy mango lassi = yummy Samosa's  = yummy  i think the only complaint would be that near the summer time, the a/c wasn't on very strong. oh well, yummy food!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was delicious! We had several entrees and each of them was great including the chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, chicken korma and saag paneer. The staff was very kind and attentive and the restaurant was a great atmosphere, even for our loud family. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For the NW Location:  Awesome food, but a little expensive for being take out. I am guessing off the menu we ordered off of they didn't adjust the prices. The wife said, \"if I have to take it home & dirty my dishes, it should be cheaper,\" ha! For that price and maybe if we are on the other side of town we will pay that much and get the dining experience."}
{"text":"nice service?had the lamb curry and It was good. Appetizer was ok, but worth the try."}
{"text":"The food I've tried is so/so but nice decor and the owner and staff are very friendly.    The naan can be hit or miss here.  One time it tasted like pita bread (maybe they ran out?) and another time it tasted like OK naan out of the tandoor.  The Chick Tikka Masala is decent.  Vindaloo is not great, in fact most of their curries (like the Mantra Masala) taste alike just different heat levels.  Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and it was satisfactory.  The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup.    Also, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.  But I always have to add salt to the entrees.  Pricing is a kinda high and they charge you a lot for every little thing - rice, raita, mango pickle."}
{"text":"After an emergency room visit, there's nothing like good Indian food to life the spirits. This place is tucked away in a strip mall- in the back corner even. I've had left overs for 3 days now and am totally lovin' it.  The Paleek Paneer was awesome and they were very generous on the big cubes of cheese. I also had the Lamb Mantra which I'll happily order again.  I only wish the prices were a little less and they were so far OUT west!"}
{"text":"Terrible!! First attempt at this place I walked in stood around for 10 minutes no one came out to greet me or even acknowledge me. Second attempt I ordered take away, food was ready In a timely manner, Only good thing. Food was so bland I had a spicy level of 7 medium hot, there was no kick nor flavor. Then my mix grill had a foul odor. Couldn't even finish my meal ended up tossing it."}
{"text":"Regrettably I'm going to have to knock some stars off Mantra Masala as I feel like the quality and value for money is dropping off sharply.  This place has never been our favourite Indian option as far as flavour goes, but for a local place where we can get some takeout it more than fit the bill.  Unfortunately, on our last couple of visits the naan has been extremely rubbery and we've felt like they have really skimped on the content of our dishes that we ordered. Our Shahi Paneer on the most recent occasion contained a mere FIVE chunks of paneer in a sea of sauce. Sorry guys, but when you're charging slightly higher prices than average for your entree portions already, I expect more than 5 cubes of cheese for my money. On our previous visit we fared a little better, with seven bits, but it's still not very much is it?   Mantra Masala's food is generally OK, perhaps not quite as tasty as some of our favourites, but in terms of value they are going downhill fast, to a point that not even their proximity to my home will call me back."}
{"text":"I have a few weaknesses about Indian Food, and as such I am gauging this place on those weaknesses I have.  They are: The  Naan (Bread), the Curry and Chutney.  I found myself ordering the Chicken Curry during this visit.  The Naan came automatically, but it was a tiny bit soggy and just warm.  I like my naan fresh and HOT!   The Curry came not too long after we had ordered and the serving size was OK.   The curry was nothing to write home about.  I remember in the past that this place had a good lunch buffet, but the last  time I visited here it seem to have been long gone.  The establishment was clean, the waiting service was excellent, the food is just OK.  In my opinion, if Teriyaki Madness (which is adjacent to his restaurant) began serving naan at their store, this place would be in serious trouble."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Excellent food but a bit pricey. I think if the prices were lowered a bit and advertised, they would increase their sales revenue.  If I could get a full meal in there, including a drink for $10-12 I would go much more often than a couple of times a year.  They offer a good selection of wine and recommend certain wines with each dish.  Also, they have a really nice bar. Overall, I love it... just can't afford it as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"We love this place! I dont feel bad when I eat here! We always get Chicken Tikka Masala, Shrimp Masala, Vegi Basil Curry, and Nan. So yum!"}
{"text":"So now the rice has become bright orange and inundated with carrots and cauliflowers rendering the actual rice pieces of the already skimpy portion invisible. This mush was also quite inedible.   The Deewane Handi (pureed spinach with potato chunks) was barely passable and terrifically under-seasoned. The eggplant dish was not as good as I remembered it being. The Lentil Soup was very lackluster and me and my companion struggled to try to finish it. We struggled in vain.  The Naan was the saving grace of their lunch special. Soft, chewy (in a good way) and the only thing we could scoop up our gravies with (since the rice was not fit to eat).   To make us feel a little better we ordered Gulab Jamun. How can you go wrong with fried fatty goodness in a sugared concoction? Correct answer: You can't.   One star for the Naan and another for the Gulab Jamun. The food was a total and utter blasphemy."}
{"text":"My first venture into attempting to find good Indian food in Vegas has ended in failure.  It wasn't BAD... but it wasn't good.  I've had better... in fact...  I've only had better than this, and it has always been much cheaper.  This is like... the Panda Express of Indian food with a really nice atmosphere (this should have been my first warning).  The total bill for two people came out to about $50.  A few weeks ago I was in a pretty shady looking Indian restaurant (most of the best ones are shady looking) in San Francisco and we ordered a LOT more, it tasted better, and the bill didn't even make it to $30.  If you're totally clueless about Indian food and your idea of travel is driving down to Mesquite, then this place is probably perfect for you.  Unfortunately, I didn't come to have American food with an Indian theme, I was looking for something that had the rich, deep, and complex flavors that I'm used to.  The lowdown:  Naan - Ahhh... the king of breads, naan bread usually whisks my senses away at the very first bite.  I'm a bread lover, and naan is easily one of the best types of bread in the world... usually...  This one was... good.  Not great, certainly not amazing like it should be... just good.  Garlic naan - I have to give them kudos on their garlic naan.  It had a better flavor than many of the others I've had.  Garlic naan usually doesn't stack up against regular naan, but this one was actually better than their plain naan.  That's not the best compliment, but it's the only one they're going to get today!  Chicken Tikka Masala - Hmm... Like naan, it is one of the dishes that I judge an Indian restaurant on...  Usually, rich, creamy, and surprisingly complex... this one was decent.  But a bit bland, with none of the richness and depth that I'm used to.  It was more like Chicken Campbell's-tomato-soup Masala.  Chicken Mantra - It tasted.... thin...  Like a watered down version of what it was meant to be.  The flavor was actually decent, but once again lacked richness and depth.    The rice was a disappointment, and a previous Yelper's comment about it being a \"mouse sized portion\" wasn't too far off the mark.  A big mouse, to be certain.... but still a mouse.  It might be the best Indian in Vegas... but I hope I'll find better."}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my all-time favorites. My experience is based on growing up eating at NYC's Curry Row (6th St B'twn 1st and 2nd Ave) then the few years in my late 20's living in Dirty Jersey I was exposed to a ton of great Indo-Paki restaurants. So, Why the background information? Simply put I'm cynical and spoiled and didn't expect the desert to have such BOMBay (ha-ha) Indian restaurants... But we do! Okay, If Indian cuisine was bad Karaoke (metaphorically speaking.) and there was a contest like...American Idol; and I was on a panel with Simon, Paula, and Randy I know we would unanimously vote Mantra Masala-Healthy Cuisine from India, to be the next American Idol.  There's never a wait and the prices are fair. (Dinner price-appetizer, variety of Nan, main course and drink 20-30$ per plate.) The service is prompt and extremely friendly. Tonight we brought a newbie to Indian cuisine and the owner (I think she was the owner?) She was nice enough to explain what's what to our friend.   Tonight I had the Chicken Vindaloo and I'm still thinking about how awesome it was. The Nan & Onion Culcha is made on site, piping hot and oh so good. The Samosa mixed appetizer is one you can't go wrong with. I gauge my restaurant on the Chicken Tikka Masla and Mantra Masala passes with flying colors. The Tikka & Tandoori is spiced perfectly and always juicy. The Mango Lassi and their Taj Beer are excellent (probably not together.) This place is extremely Vegetarian friendly.  I'm psyched they are getting ready to start a lunch buffet next week. The place has doubled in size within the last couple of months. It's a clean place with a dark and cozy atmosphere. The decor is a lot more modern then any other place I've been.   If you like Indian food you will be addicted to Mantra Masala."}
{"text":"The owner is super nice! The only thing I don't like about this place is high prices and very small portions. The lamb curry is good but the chicken tikka masala did not taste right...the rice came in a very tiny container not even enough for just one person, the naan was extremely thin & hard."}
{"text":"I am a huge pakistanian/indian foodie, so after reading the reviews, I decided to try this place for dinner.  I was from Houston, TX, where there is an abudant of pakistanian/indian food around, so my reviews below may be very critical.  Pros Very close nice decor  Cons food -Mantra mixed appetizer which includes the samosa, onion bhaji, and chicken pakora -----samosa:  filled with lentils, I am used to the potatoes filling, so didn't like this one -----onion bhaji:  just taste like fried batter to me -----chicken pakora: dipped in the tamarind chutney...what do you get?  Sweet and sour chicken!!!!  My piece of chicken fell out of the thick cold batter.  -Mantra Mixed Grill (They are tiny portion, like others have mentioned, but it's all good since it's the quality that I want to try out at this place) -----Barah Kabob:  the part that was super grilled was ok, but the middle part tasted kinda mushed in a way -----Chicken tandori/chicken bazari:  I don't know..I tried other pieces that are not chicken tikka, and it tasted kinda grainey, so I stuck to the chicken tikka -----Chicken Tikka:  this taste the most familiar. But...I have not seen such a small piece.  -----Masala chai tea:  it kinda taste like the bigelow spiced chai tea that I could easily steep at home, office, anywhere.  Conclusion:  I will drive the further distance to go to my favorite indian restaurant here in Vegas, Mint Indian Bistro."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a little snack and ordered the Mantra Masala Appetizer Sampler and a basket of Garlic Naan.  Don't remember the names of the items  on the sampler, but it was Samosas, a crispy onion thing, and  a batter fried chicken Item. The first two were good, but the chicken was tough. The two chutneys that came with the sampler were delicious too.  Not the best Indian food we've had, but seems like the only one in  the area. ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I've ever eaten. Had Lamb Korma and Lamb Vindaloo. Both dishes were served with super tough lamb and the flavors were just not good. The garlic naan was stale and some pieces were rock hard. Spent $50 on a meal and ended up throwing it away and eating popcorn for dinner. This place is a joke. Go somewhere else if you're craving Indian."}
{"text":"I am not very well versed in Indian cuisine, but from what I've previously tried, this was just average... the prices are good, but the food didn't wow me at all"}
{"text":"I was really excited about eating here, since it's close to my work and had received a Best of Las Vegas award.   The wait time for my food was long. Maybe I had just caught them on an off day. The portion size for the price was good. The taste was okay, although somewhat bland."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Chicken Tikka Masala, basmati rice, and naan. Ordered take out for 8 people - the staff was friendly, the owner helped me load my car, and was expecially helpful when I asked for plates/utinsels/napkins. Overall, very friendly and good food. I'd certainly return!"}
{"text":"Great food! The restaurant itself is very clean. The prices do seem a bit on the high side, but worth it. Had the Tandoori chicken, Tikka Masala, lamb Vindaloo (spicy), Sag Paneer, Samosas, garlic Naan bread, and a mango Lassie. Food had great flavors in ever dish I tried. Very tasty! Great customer service that is both friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was just because I was craving Indian cuisine, or, if it was just that good!  Garlic naan, da bomb.  And the house chef special Masala sauce is delicious any-style."}
{"text":"I've been craving curry for a while and thought about good o' Indian comfort food. After a few search from fellow yelpers I decided that Mantra Masala is exactly where I need to be.  Luckily I managed to kidnap 2 buddies of mine to help me \"experiment\" a little bit more since this was my second time ever having Indian food.   Both my friends were new to Indian food as well I figured I'd order the Mantra's Mixed Grill which consist of most of their specialties for everyone to share; Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka, Bazari Chicken, and Barah Kabab (lamb).  All of which were pretty tender and spiced really well.    Our server looked at us if like that wasn't enough, so I asked him to recommend us another dish to which he concluded that we should try the Chicken Tikka Masala. OMGggg this stuff was amazing!!  I didn't know this, but this is exactly what i've been looking for!! Not Curry! Spiced, boneless chicken roasted in clay oven, cooked in creamy tomato sauce.  I wanted to call my mom and cry because it was so darn good! ;( There were plenty of sauce left that we dipped our Garlic Nan (leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic) into it, poured some over rice, and also dipped some of the Mantra's Mixed Grilled stuff into it as well :X  I could see why he wanted us to order the 2nd dishes because the portion were not that big at all.  Just enough which is perfect because we don't need to stuff ourselves with too much goodness.  A tad bit pricier, BUT over at Mantra Masala it's clear that they implement the philosophy's \"quality over quantity.\"  Good stuff all around.. nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's day since it was close to home and we were craving Indian.  I've had Indian food all over Vegas and this was one of the worst experiences.  I really wanted to like the place as I love to support local mom and pop establishments but this was quite disappointing.  We ordered the chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, veggie samosa and some garlic naan.  The chicken korma tasted off and was really oily.  The lamb vindaloo also did not taste like other vindaloos we've had, this tasted a little too tangy.  The garlic naan tasted like it was reheated in a microwave so it got hard and chewy once it cooled down.  The only saving grace was the vegetable samosa, which was filled with potatoes and peas and had good flavor.  I wish I could say that I'd try this place again, but I think I'll just drive further and go to the Mint or India Palace for better indian food."}
{"text":"Amazing carry out! Delicious and ready in 20 mins tops. I don't know how they do it but it's awesome. Aloo Gobi allllll day long! Yummy"}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food and this place was close by the office so I thought to give it a try though a co-worker had a less than positive experience on her visit.   I had the lunch special #2 (chicken tikka and spinach puree with legumes) and ordered to-go. The online menu states that soup is included in the lunch special but when I asked about it they said \"not for to-go orders\" that stipulation was not stated on their website. The person who took my order seemed a tad bit confused and did not really understand what I was saying.  When I went to pick up, my food was waiting in a \"locker-type\" container and wasn't that hot. I opened the styrofoam box to find HALF a piece of naan. As a fan of Indian cuisine I was most looking forward to this part of the meal. The naan was thin and simply O.K. The portion was a bit small for $10.00; only 3 pieces of chicken and about a table spoon of veggies. The basmati rice lacked in flavor and disappointed as one of my favorite parts to Indian cuisine.  All in all it satisfied my instant craving for Indian food but would not go again due to the portion size and lack of flavor.   It was the epitome of the \"2 star\" rating: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Ambiance- 4 stars Food- 3.5 stars Price- 2 stars  We came here in a large group for dinner and the server was very helpful in helping us order our dishes.  For an appetizer, we had the Mussels Mantra. The flavor was good, but it was overcooked....a lil tough and chewy. We also tried the Padpi Chat. I was definitely not a fan of this item. For the entrees, we decided on the sea bass, the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Mantra and the Dewane Handi. Out of everything, the sea bass was my favorite, flavored just right. The lamb was dry and the dewane handi was bland to me. I think my favorite part of the meal was the Nan. I wasn't too impressed with the meal and after we got the check it made me less impressed. Like I said before, we had a large group (15 people) and it came out to be 41 dollars a person....or 82 dollars a couple in our case. I'm definitely not stingy when it comes to good food, but for the price and what we got I'm not sure I will be returning unless its for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Terrible tomatoey vindaloo.  Terribly overpriced and the charge 3.75 for rice with your dish.  Who did they bribe to win a \"best of lv\" award?"}
{"text":"We were the only diners when we had late lunch here on a weekend and ordered:  Chicken tikka masala: No Indian restaurant can go wrong with this! Theirs is pretty good. The lean cut of chicken is tender. The sauce is flavorful & delicious with just the right amount of spiciness.   Shrimp masala: Sauce is just okay.The shrimps were large, but rubbery.   Vegetable basil curry (made of assorted veggies/basil/roasted cumin/coriander/fenugreek) - good except they obviously  used frozen veggies :(  which for me is a no-no in restaurants!   Gulab jamun: a sweet way to end a meal :)   Came here on a Saturday, entrées were a bit pricey for what you get as their portion is small. You also  have to pay extra for nan bread or basmati rice!  The plus side: the place is clean, with a classy (but dark) interior and has a nice & not very elaborative Indian decor;  and the server is attentive, courteous  & knowledgable.   Maybe I'll come back on a weekday as they are supposed to have a better deal with their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Very good food!! Had rack of lamb, asked them to make it spicy & it was great. Good service!!! Lamb was very succulent! Can't wait to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Tapan Bose is the Chef here and has always given me food that is bar none some of the best Indian food I've had. Being an Indian, and knowing Indian food- I can recommend this place to anyone with a hungering for desi cuisine."}
{"text":"We had one dish not sure of the name, but it was out of this world! So tasty! Then we returned for another dish I can't pronounce and it was so disappointing. I'm getting the idea that there are two chefs in the kitchen, one knows how to cook and the other one should be busing dishes."}
{"text":"I grew up eating indian cuisine all over California so I have a love for it. Mantra masala is one of my favs. I've eaten here plenty of times and I've NEVER been disappointed. I order ToGo more often because of my kids and it's still as good and fresh as when we dine in. I feel like other places I order to go, I get home and the food is thrown together or wrong because they don't care and know I can't complain since I'm home. But not here!! Most importantly is always great service and owner whom appreciates our business. I always get 2 orders of garlic nann, basamati rice, chicken tikki masala and chicken sagg (creamy spinach). Like I said, these dishes are always on point!!! I can see how people think portions are small or over priced, but then again you see the price before you order.. So people you can't complain about price!!"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing for takeout.  I ordered a garlic naan and chicken tandoori.  It came in a small, under-portion white box, but that was just the start.  The chicken was yellow and pink on the inside- no tandoor char marks, no complex flavors.  The onions were raw and uncooked.  Generally disappointing considering how good the photos look for dine-in."}
{"text":"I like the Lamb Tandoori dish they do a lot. It is pricey but feeds me and my husband. This lamb dish keeps me coming back.  One warning they seem to doubt Americans ability to take spice so be emphatic.   Service is weird, I always leave feeling like I was taking to someone with a lobotomy.  Not mean or inattentive just not all the lights are on.  Insofar I have found service to be weird at all the Indian places we have tried.  Namaste and the Celine Dion covers. Origin and the credit card at your table issue."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Indian food. It's one of my favorites in the valley. It's a little on the pricey side, but well worth it! Every dish I've ordered has exceeded my expectations. Will always come back and dine again, great experience and meals."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Gerald and I went there a week or so ago and really enjoyed the food.  Their chicken tikka masala was really good; the chicken was very flavorful, and the curry was just right.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was high up there, and the chicken was just perfect.  We ordered some appetizers (the sampling platter with the somosas and a few other things), and they were all quite good as well.  The only thing I didn't like about them was they seemed to all be covered in a thin layer of salt.  It tasted great, but it was a bit salty.  Their home-made tamarind sauce was delicious and went well with the appetizers.  We also ordered a special eggplant dish that was also pretty good.  Gerald didn't care for it, but I thought it was tasty.  The service was very good; the waiter was friendly and attentive.  It was very quiet when we went; there were only one or two other tables the whole time.  I hope that this place picks up because it's among the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was good. Papdi chat to start. And we had lamb biryani and chicken tiki marsala. Oh and some garlic naan. More people should eat Indian food, it's so flavorful. And it would be nice to have not been the only ones there."}
{"text":"So, SO good. I'm new to Las Vegas, and was craving Indian food tonight. After dinner tonight I am completely satisfied.  We started with the samosas - delicious. Crisp on the outside, a little spicy on the inside, and whatever that green dipping sauce was - yum. :) Dinner was the Chicken Tikka Masala and an order of the plain Naan.   My boyfriend and I decided it was he beat naan we have ever had. (Not to say we KNOW Indian food, but we have had enough to compare!) I loved the spice to the Masala too. I ordered mine medium-hot, and it was perfect.   The only thing I'd say that could improve after this first trip would be the service. It was a little slow, my water ran out a couple times (spicy food + small water glasses = water refills for me), and one of the employees (family-owned I'm assuming) had a phone that kept ringing which was a little annoying. However, I'd say if you order an appetizer, you'd be fine.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I've ever had. I thought we would try this place and order to go since the restaurant is so close to my house. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and lamb korma with garlic naan. The food was very bland and a weird texture. The rice tasted like it was made in a rice maker the day before and was very mushy. The naan was hard and lacked in garlic flavor. Save your money and go somewhere else. Waste of $45!"}
{"text":"In a word: yummy! Indian food tends toward the expensive side, so I appreciate Mantra Masala's lunch special menu. I went with \"Lunch Two\" featuring Chicken Tikka Masala. It comes with a side of Dewane Handi (spinach puree with assorted vegetables), some seasoned Basmati Rice, and a decently sized piece of Naan.  To be real, it's not a whole lot of food for $7.95 + tax. But Mantra preaches healthy food. With that in mind, it's a good portion and definitely satiated my appetite without making me overly full. And most importantly, everything was delicious. I prefer the flavor of Mantra's Chicken Tikka Masala over Mint Indian Bistro's. The Naan was cooked perfectly and the Dewane Handi was surprisingly good (I've never had it before).  I haven't eaten dinner at Mantra. Looking at the dinner menu prices, I probably wouldn't want to. For lunch, however, it presents a nice option. It is a bit far from work, but it's a quick zip up the 215. I'll definitely get lunch there again some day.  Note: A sign outside advertizes lunch specials under $6. This is misleading. One lunch dish is $5.95. The rest are $7.95 or higher.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"My wife and I debated on getting separate meals because of the $15 per entree cost just to try someplace new. I'm glad we ended up just sharing because splitting the Garlic Nan and Chicken Tikki Masala was just enough to satisfy the both of us for lunch. The bread is a MUST, especially with the soup. Our final bill was just over $19 but I have absolutely no complaints. Very happy that we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately it's carry out only so you're still stuck doing your own dishes."}
{"text":"Northwest Durango Location- iloved it. It is a bit pricey for take out- but I went in there with zero expectations. I had no idea what to order, and just told the gentleman that I was ordering for my husband and I, what did he recommend. He gave me the chicken masala and a lamb dish. Medium heat. Holy chow were they delish. So with that being said, I would go back again."}
{"text":"food: good for the area. price: eh service: good I'm not a big fan of Indian food so I can't say much."}
{"text":"I went for their onion bhaji, it was delish, way cheaper than nearby places and they give you a lot. My order was to go, the transaction was quick and within no time I was in my car burning the roof of my mouth eating wonderfulness."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 days in a row!  Great food cooked to order, this is their second location so it's basically a to go type place. If your looking to sit down in a nice environment check out their downtown location. I recommend the chicken tiki marsala or tandoori chicken yummm."}
{"text":"All I got was tikka masala. It cost 15$ and it came in a very small container. 15$ for a tiny amount of food is not worth it. I have been to Indian buffets that are cheaper and are still very good. It's no wonder this place is always dead. Small portions big prices. I expect this place to be out of business soon"}
{"text":"A quiet nicely decorated Indian restaurant in the southwest area of town.  We were the only diners on a Sunday night (which usually isn't a good thing), but they are hidden away.  The Husband and I shared:  * Lamb Biryani \"Baked casserole of basmati rice and lamb richly flavored with saffron.\" ($16.95) - The Husband has a special liking to biryani and immediately looked through the menu for this item.  He ordered it spicy and definitely enjoyed it, more so with the leftovers the next day.  * Malai Kofta \"Mixed vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce.\" ($12.95) - I'm all about any kind of creamy sauce and there are very few I don't like in Indian cuisine.  Their version was super tasty and really good with the garlic nan bread.  Yum!  I chose medium for my spice.  It also came with rice.  The dumplings were just okay though.  * Garlic Nan \"Leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic in the tandoor.\" ($2.95) - When going nan, garlic is the only way to go.  So good, I could only wish for more.  Overall, the food was pretty good.  Our waiter was definitely attentive, until he got stuck on the phone with a to go order.  It is rather expensive for the two entrees and condiment we ordered, even with an Entertainment Book coupon.  We'd consider going again, but definitely know why the Indian lunch buffets do so well in the city."}
{"text":"Soooo my husband and I just relocated here to Vegas from Atlanta and we love it here. Just so happens that I had a taste for some indian food. So I found this on yelp. This is literally 5 minutes from my house. The food was delicious. I got the tandoori chicken, vegetable samosas, naan bread, then I desired something a little sweet so for dessert I had the galub jamun (which were great, just simply two small round balls drenched in rose syrup). This place has a very nice small intimate setting and everyone is nice. Can't wait to go back!!! I will try the chicken tikka masala!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch with a friend who lives in the area.   We all grabbed a Lunch #2: Chicken Tikka, Dwane Handi, seasoned rice, naan and tomato soup. It was good, but not the best. Chiken tikka was juicy, but the tikka sauce seemed less complex than others. Dwane Handi is good, tomato soup was pretty standard, naan was okay. The portions aren't that big, but it did the trick. I just was more sad about the tiny dollop of rice. I mean isn't that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauces and flavors of the dishes? By the end I was just taking spoonfuls of the dishes since I was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesty. This Asian has to have rice!!!   $7.95 isn't bad for a lunch, but with a lot of Indian places offering a buffet for $9-11 it isn't necessarily value when compared, but good value for being the only Indian in the SW and few places with lunch specials there.  Service wasn't really personable. We didn't get any drink refills and when ordering drinks he took mine and the BFs drink order and turned around without asking our friend if they want a drink. No drink for you!   It's okay if you want Indian nearby, but I think a drive out is worth it."}
{"text":"My God, this place sucks...Very disappointing. I'm sitting here eating soft samosas that taste average and appear to be microwaved rather than freshly fried. The naan bread has a limp, chewy, suspiciously microwaved texture also. Lamb korma is somewhat lacking in flavor. When I walked in the door tonight the owner stared right at me and didn't even acknowledge me plus the food is also overpriced. I wanted to like it as Indian Palace my FAVORITE is not close by but I will not be back here as I have nothing good to say.  If you actually know good Indian food I can't see that this would be appealing.  Updated- I even wrote the owner himself to tell him how disappointed I was and how bad my meal was. Rather than any kind of effort to fix the situation, he said\" thank you for your kind compliments. \"That's it.  This guy is a jerk and doesn't deserve to be in business with how badly he treats customers and yelp, don't block my review as it is real and this was a real and true experience I had. I'll prove it if need be.   Update- I would also like to mention that I just came back from Dubai where I had the pleasure of dining in an area heavily populated by Indians, so I do know what good Indian is. Only Westerners who don't know any better could like this and the Indians posting on here that like it are likely friends with management."}
{"text":"One of my friends has been to India recently, and she recommended Mantra Masala as a place to go for Indian food.  She said Mantra Masala definitely served dishes reminiscent of those she had in India, and I decided to give it a try. I've been to another Indian restaurant called Tamba before, and I wanted to see how Mantra Masala was like in comparision to my experience at Tamba.  I went to Mantra Masala recently for dinner with some friends.  This restaurant is small and hidden away, so we almost missed it.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and the lighting was quite dim, with ethnic music playing quietly in the background.  My friend had the Vegetable Samosa as an appetizer and the Lamb Vindaloo.  My other friend had the Lamb Mantra and the Taj Mahal beer.  My best friend and I shared the Chicken Biryani.  All four of us also had the Garlic Nan and Spinach Nan.  The Chicken Biryani was a bit mushy and not that remarkable.  My friend liked her Vegetable Samosa, but she didn't like her Lamb Vindaloo that much.  I tasted the Lamb Vindaloo, and I actually liked the potatoes in the dish, and the lamb was pretty tender.  The Lamb Mantra was pretty good, nice and spicy, and we also liked the Spinach Nan dipped in the yogurt they gave us. I gave Mantra Masala 3 stars because I felt that the dishes I tried here just wasn't as flavorful as the ones I tried at Tamba.  Furthermore, in comparison to Tamba, the portions were quite small but very pricey!!!  Despite all that, we had a decent time here overall."}
{"text":"worst indian food ever. order the chicken tikka which did not even look remotely like chicken. masada sauce was runny and had no flavor. never ever going back."}
{"text":"Went there today on a whim, the ambiance is zen, the waiter was not bad, like he did his job checked up on us refilled our beverages but didn't seem happy. I would ask a question and his reply and tone would come out dull and rude! Like cheer up dude! What's your deal?!   Food decent, small portions and a bit overpriced.  I do like the mango lassi!"}
{"text":"The food is edible but definitely isn't even close to good Indian food. I  got the eggplant bharta which was very disappointing. It was basically all peas. My boyfriend got the chicken vindaloo which he said was ok. The naan was good. We wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"We were heading south to the M Resort to catch a lounge act; it was a business trip. (On a side note, I think M Resort does modern with more grace than Aria.) I had wanted to try Mantra Masala because it is featured on lvvegan.com (great resource for you Las Vegan vegans), and because it was on the way, we stopped in.   My theory is that Mantra is hoping that there are some Indian-food lovers within a 3-mile radius who don't want to venture far. If that were me, then I would be pleased with the offerings. We had dal, dewane handi and naan. The dal was more tomato-y than varieties I have experienced, but the flavors and spice levels were solid. (We asked for hotter than \"white people hot\", and they interpreted that nicely.)  The naan was fine, not spectacular.   However, the real disappointment were the prices, especially given the mouse-sized portion of rice that comes with an entree. While $30 for 2 is not an expensive dinner, when you are staring at an entree, a side, a peck of rice and a basket of naan, you start to fantasize about the $19 for 2 spread you could be noshing on at the Namaste buffet.   And, although we were not there for lunch, they gave us a lunch special menu to look over. There was one under $6, but it is only rice and one entree. No buffet. No deal. I truly wonder how an Indian restaurant can neglect the beauty of a lunch buffet. It is the only buffet I will eat.  In closing, if you are within walking distance to Mantra Masala, it is probably the best food you could walk to, which might sound like an insult, but I mean it is a 3-star compliment."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight, and I was completely blown away.  The food was excellent. I had the  Saag Paneer, and loved it.  The cheese and yogurt is made there at the restaurant, and the portions were the perfect size.  Not too big, and not too small. The ambience would be great for either a date, or just for a nice night out, and prices were reasonable.  I highly recommend it, and plan to be back soon myself."}
{"text":"Must nastiest indian food ever. So bland no flavor and just disgusting. Whomever thinks this good you must not have tastebuds. We had the tikka masala and chicken curry and it had no spice and when I asked for a level 6 there was no heat to the dish at all. I was so hungry after yet lost my appetite for the rest of the night. Tomorrow I'm going to go to a good indian restaurant because this place seriously made me never want to eat Indian again. I should have known not to go there because there was only one customer in the whole place."}
{"text":"This was a very enjoyable dining experience. Like others have pointed out, this restaurant serves incredible Indian cuisine. Being somewhat of a connoisseur of ethnic cuisines, I was pleasantly surprised by how close to the \"authentic\" Indian cuisine this place was--almost like you were in India itself!!! Many vegetarian options which were flavorful and yummy! Chicken Masala was out of this world as well. Naan was fresh and full of flavor as well. The owner was nice enough to point out that they don't use any unnatural oils and saturated fats in their cooking--indeed their food tasted healthier than most Indian places without the aftertaste of \"not-so-fresh\" ingredients and oils. Decor was very nice and elegant. I was very impressed considering the shopping center location. Service was average, nothing too incredible here, but the people were friendly. PRICES!!! are incredible. We ate two lunch specials with quite a few inclusive dishes and paid under $20!!!! I was very happy with my bill and tipped accordingly. They offer A+ lunch specials and dinner prices are also very competitive. I am pleasantly surprised that this restaurant already has so many great reviews as the couple of times I've been here, our party was the only one at the restaurant. Let's keep Mantra Masala in business, as it is the best Indian restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I went to get some Indian take out from Mantra Masala on Sunday, I love Indian food and eat it often, I order my usual, (never eaten here before, just other places) I get home and the rice is HARD from sitting out, the Kofta is falling apart, the chicken masala OLD the chicken was ROTTEN.. I call the owner, he says he will give me my money back, my fiance threw his portion away as i was on the phone with him, on the way to get other food with my crying newborn, I get back and go to return in monday and they are closed so i call today, he says now that its not fresh he will not give me my money back (I am assuming he was just going to toss my food back in with the food he serves the other customers) I tell him how am i suppose to return food to a closed place? finally he says ok i can return it, I get there and TEN minutes of waiting with the staff IGNORING me, he comes up and refuses to take the food back because a quarter of it is gone, well im sorry i dont feel like digging through the trash for the food my fiance threw out, obviously this business is hurting if they cant give the money back for rotten food, and they want the food back fresh- probably to toss it in with the other food to serve to the (one or two) customers they have a day.. if you ever watched the kitchen from hell, the rotten food on there, this is how it tasted, and i bet the last review was put up by the owner after i said i was going to be coming on here to complain, as well as to the better business bur. and the health dept. I hope he goeas out of business! GROSS ROTTEN FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Very taste, fantastic service! They pride themselves on no oil healthy cooking. Everything was delicious and you don't feel loaded down after your meal.  Make sure to get a mango lassi to wash all that yummy food down."}
{"text":"I have been to Mantra Masala 3 times for lunch and had their Chicken Tikka Malasa and Tandoori chicken lunch special every time.  Very yummy! Love the tomato soup they serve with the lunch specials and their naan is really good."}
{"text":"Although I'm thankful that we have a new option in dining choices in this area, this place needs some work. I called in the order and drove over to pick it up. The inside of the restaurant must have been 85 degrees inside. It was so hot that I was literally soaked with sweat after waiting a mere 4 minutes for my order. How can a place that hot be sanitary? The garlic Naan was meh ...okay. I wouldn't say it's any better than the kind you can buy at trader Joe's. The Tikka Masala chicken had great creamy flavor and would've been perfect if the cheap Styrofoam it was in didn't break inside the bag and spill. The rice was was cooked as it should be, nothing special. The price was high, another negative."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge let down. I should have known not to visit empty restaurant but gave them a chance anyway. Food was horrible, Chicken Tandoori was dry, Biryani was bland. I have no idea, how they could mess up that bad. I like to give people a second chance since I know how hard it is to build and run a business. But this one is hard to swallow so I will say you are on your own in this one."}
{"text":"Fresh food, owner a brilliant chef, enthralling to talk to about indian cuisine and spices, will be back often..."}
{"text":"For me, this place is great because of the location.  I really like Indian food, but most of the good places are in the Flamingo/Paradise area, and I don't have a reason to go out towards that UNLV area anymore.  I was here yesterday for lunch.  There were 8 or so different lunch specials with about half of them being vegetarian ranging from $5.95 to $8.95.  Only one of the specials was $5.95 with the rest being $7.95 or $8.95.  I don't remember what the vegetarian options were, but pretty much every plate included a tomato soup, rice, a piece of naan, a spinach puree.  You could choose either tandoori chicken or chicken tikki masala for $7.95 or both for $8.95...  Me and the SO had the chicken masala which was really good.  The sauce was great to dip the naan in, and I was pretty much full most of the day from it...  I can't wait to go back for dinner to try something new."}
{"text":"The food was decent but pricy. It was a tad warm inside the resturant but clean and we'll maintained. The employee's know the menu well and we're very helpful. However I'm not sure I'll be back because the food was to much for the amount you received."}
{"text":"First timers!!!!! Never really tried Indian food so was a little skeptical.. tried the Chicken Korma and the Lamp Biryani, was a little bit of a wait but the server explained the way the food is cooked is unique and takes a little longer BUT is TOTALLY worth the wait!!! The food was great!!! Def coming back!!"}
{"text":"We were wary of this place after seeing the less than ideal ratings but our fears were unfounded!!  My husband and I are vegetarians. We eat Indian food several times a month and we've had it even in Asia.  We ordered the onion bhaji (4/5), vegetable samosas (3/5), garlic naan (5/5), paneer tikka masala (5/5) and malai kofta (4.5/5). One thing we didn't like is that the rice that came with the curries were just a wee bit. If we didn't have naan, it'd have been insufficient.  Dinner for 2 came up to just under $48 excluding tips. A little pricey especially for the location and quantity. But we will come back again because it's close to where we live."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant. Great food and awesome service. It's a small place and tends to be really quiet. It's definitely a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Saw the 4 stars review and decided to try this place. I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, Nan and Garlic Nan. All of them are just okay, not great and not bad. The chicken was dry and the regular Nan was kind of burned. I definitely had better Indian food in many other restaurants. The food alone probably deserves 3 stars but the value probably is right about 2 stars. For the price that they charged I expected much better food than what I got. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I seem to be the minority here but I was not at all impressed! The price for the chicken tikka masala (14.95) is what I usually pay at a sit down Indian restaurant with linens on the table.  I figured that, if the food was good, the price would be worth it but the food was not good! The chicken was not all white meat and it was gristle filled with chunks of fat attached! The sauce was not well cooked so it separated into a watery mess when I put it over rice and on a dish at home (think undercooked spaghetti sauce!).  The sauce was also heavy on the tomatoes and very light in the Indian spices! The rice was not jasmine rice but some yellow rice out of a package.  In short, this place is way over priced and under spiced! It is too bad because they could do a great business if only they took care and produced a higher quality product. As it stands, this food was a giant rip-off!  Save your money..."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because we wanted Indian food and this was the closest to Summerlin. I am happy that we did. Everything was delicious. Garlic nan, Samosa's with tamarind and mint sauces (made there), Chicken Curry, tender Lamb in a garlic cream sauce. Loved everything. My only complaint is that it took a long time to get the food out but it was worth it."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for awhile now and always drive by. I read some reviews and was a little worried but we decided to try anyways. I'm so glad that we did!!  We got there right after they opened for dinner so we were the only table there for a little while. The decor was pretty cool and calming. The music was pretty calming as well.   Our server was attentive and our food was absolutely delicious!!   It wasn't busy but it should be. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a weekday.   The restaurant had 2 seperate couples having dinner so it was pretty quiet.  The food was pretty good.  The spice level ranges from not spicy, medium, very spicy.  We ordered very spicy and personally I did not think it was very spicy, it still seemed a bit bland.  The chicken biryani is what we had and it was decent.  In terms of the prices and the amount of food you are served it does not compare.  We also had the Badam Lassi (mango smoothie w/ almond) the mango was VERY SOUR!!     I will/may go back only because it is very close and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Oh boy. A rare bad review. Let me state clearly that I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt. At first I thought \"Maybe it's because I'm here on (insert any day of the week but Monday)\", or maybe because \"I'm here (alone/with a date/with colleagues)\" . a half-dozen \"benefits of the doubt\". No more! I'm never going back.  No cocktails, no beer, only wine. \"Lunch Specials\" are advertised, but apparently no lunch buffet. In no way could this restaurant be considered competitive. Not in the West End of London (by far!), not in Silicon Valley, not in Washington D.C. ,  and not even in the desert wasteland of Indian Cuisine that is The Southwest Neighborhood of Las Vegas. Even in a field of 1, this restaurant doesn't rate.    Unless you live in the Southwest Neighborhood, you would never know this place exists except for listing conglomerators with apps in the app store. And that's probably just as well . Service is consistently slow, though courteous. This is truly the only Indian restaurant west of Decatur but you would never know it. Ask for a booth or table right next to the telephone...so you can listen to the chirping of the ringer ring of the hook the -entire- length of your dinner. This is a classic example of a poorly-run restaurant that gives Las Vegas restaurants a bad name.  Why is the phone ringing off the hook? Because everybody from a 10-mile radius is ordering from one of those UHAUL-style food delivery places and this is the only Indian-cuisine restaurant in the area. Is the food authentic? Is the food fairly priced? Is the wine list good? I  think the answers to these questions is \"probably, yes\", but really what is \"authentic Indian cuisine\"? If you read the original owner's numerous publicly-available print-media articles you would conclude there is no more  \"authentic Indian cuisine\" than this restaurant. I  don't think most people who are frequent customers choose to eat here because of this restaurant's value, authenticity, or wine list...and really couldn't care less about the poor service. I  think most frequent customers of this restaurant eat here because they work in the nearby Dignity Heath San Martin hospital complex, they live in the traffic-jam-central nearby housing developments of  Mountain's Edge or Rhodes Ranch (both developments notoriously crammed to the gills with more residential units than can be supported by the surrounding businesses causing huge infrastructure problems... ) or any of the mega-complex apartment villages that plague the Southwest Neighborhood. This restaurant will never attract a sufficient level of tourist traffic because of its location, and there is no alternative restaurant of this ethnic specialty within any reasonable amount of driving time, and the residents of the aforementioned housing developments and local employers like the hospital are totally accustomed to poor quality and poor service, so this business will always remain.   The ambience of the restaurant holds no value for a romantic liaison, a business conversation, or even a large gathering like a UYE. Only those with a LOT of time on their hands come here at night. Like only retirees and families with multiple children bother coming here at night (which describes the predominant makeup of those who live in this neighbourhood).   I  doubt anybody but the management of this restaurant and Yelpers who will never have the chance to visit this restaurant will ever read this review. That being said, I offer one piece of advice, and I  bet you can't guess what it is.... Is it \"Try the Lamb Vindaloo\" or \"Save room for a Mango Lassi\"? No. It is simple: Bring a bottle of water in your purse when you come here for dinner. Better yet, just go next door to Teriyaki Madness and save your money.  (Why is this restaurant's ambience poor? The telephone ringing constantly, for starters. Secondly, the interior design seems like it was designed in some computer game like \"The Sims\" or by midgets with vengeance against tall people. Also, the second booth has cloth so thread bare the stuffing is poking out. The booths are placed so close together you have to be a little person to fit into them without feeling like the table is poking you in the stomach and I am by far certainly not a candidate for weight loss! The \"mantra\" here should be \"if you have time to lean you have time to clean\" but it is, sadly, not.)"}
{"text":"This my favorite place for lunch! The lunch prices are great and the food comes quickly. I wish the tikka masala came with more chicken though! Don't even ask to substitute anything, you will get a lesson on food costs and how to run a restaurant. I've never been here for dinner. This place is closed on Monday."}
{"text":"very good! went for some buffalo wild wings but instead I ended up having some indian cuisine. Service was very good! The way to go is chicken curry, basmati rice, and garlic bread right out of the oven.   Nice small place."}
{"text":"I was craving for Indian food that's why I'm here, had chicken curry and cauliflower with potato , they both taste the same , not much favor , not the best Indian food I ever had...."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Indian restaurants in town. The owner is a really nice guy who gives exceptional service and the food is to die for! I'm coming back for more. Very impressed!"}
