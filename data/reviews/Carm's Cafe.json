{"text":"Nice atmosphere and delicious food. I got turkey club and wife got the chicken salad sandwich . both tasted great and at a fair price. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"A place where everyone knows my name! What an awesome spot to grab lunch. The staff are super friendly, and remember your favorites. The owner is great and very approachable."}
{"text":"I go there nearly every day for quick breakfast and a cup of coffee.  Their lunch menu is delicious and healthy, and they have plenty of delicious confections if you're in the mood for a snack.  Great atmosphere with friendly staff; they really go the extra mile to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Food is great! Everything is made from scratch! The owner is very sweet! Vegetarian options and healthy fare"}
{"text":"Met my youngest daughter here for lunch today.  It's not one of the regular places we go, but it's in the part of town we needed to run errands in today.  I'm glad we picked this place!  I had the avocado chicken salad sandwich and a pumpkin bisque.  Honestly the pumpkin bisque was a gamble, but it paid off.  It was rich and savory - a solid start to what has to be in the running for the best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had.  It's a no frills place that still manages an artistic flair.  We'll definitely be adding Carm's to the list of places we frequent."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. I ate here a few months back and felt it was overpriced for what I got. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Not impressed. No music, no backround noise, it's like eating at the library. Waited 30 mins for a bagel sandwich, not sure why since I was one of three customers, and the other two were already eating. Watery smoothies, no personality staff, and slow bagel time ensures I won't be back. Maybe head across the street next time."}
{"text":"Great place to get healthy delicious choices in downtown Concord. Homemade from fresh ingredients with a chefs flare. Sometimes they sell out of particular items due to their demands on themselves to cook from scratch. Wonderful soups each day at lunch and they also have the option for soup carry out. Their chicken fajita soup is some of the best I have ever eaten. Another favorite is the PBLT, homemade pimento cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The cheesecake is to die for and the magic bars are yummy. This is not always a fast place to eat but well worth the wait.  Saturday breakfast varies and changes it up a lot.....from shrimp and grits to pumpkin pancakes, never a dull dish. Try it you'll like it!"}
{"text":"This place so cute outside. Inside it's rather small and the service is super slow. The staff isn't very happy to help you more like irritated you are ordering something kind of weird and not very welcoming. The owner isn't very friendly. I ordered a coffee and bagel sandwich to go. There was only one other person in the place that ordered a coffee to go. It took twenty minutes for her to get her coffee and I was there before her and was waiting another ten minutes after she left. Being the only customer left in the place I could hear staff talking and not really working on getting my order to me fast. Never will go back again coffee was ok and bagel was just a bagel nothing worth my time. Definitely do not recommend. However there is other places I can get my coffee at like Ellie's. And as for food 2 Gals Kitchen and the Bistro are in same area and the food and staff is 100% better!"}
{"text":"Was excellent when Carm, the original owner and namesake, owned it   and replicated her own Italian family recipes and filled the store with Tuscan sunflowers to pay tribute to her late mother.. Now the warmth and charm -- and excellent food  -- are gone.    Went there in April to find Carm and her family had moved  back to Connecticut .  While the new owner tries to capture Carm's recipes,  and capitalize  on the popularity Carm built, she falls flat and you're left with yet another mediocre  \"family\" place with service moving at a snail's pace.   Now \"ho-hum\"  instead of \" Oh, yum!\"."}
{"text":"I've visited Carm's a couple of times for breakfast and for lunch, and each time I've not been disappointed. The food is fresh and house-made. The environment itself is small, the menus are just a sheet of paper and the decor doesn't \"wow\" you, but the food and service certainly makes up for this. The owner is very kind and will provide you with recommendations if you're unsure of what to order."}
{"text":"Carm's would be a great place to go if they didn't  run out of menu items! I have been there multiple times (4) when they were just inexplicably out of what I ordered.   It would also help if the staff seemed somewhat sorry about it but no one ever seems to care.  VERY slow service and no one except the owner is particularly friendly or caring at all.   I used to really like the place but now I never go just because they probably won't have what I want anyway so why bother."}
{"text":"I love Carm's! It's a great small home town business with a great selection on their menus that can change daily. I will be an avocado chicken salad girl on a spinach wrap for life!"}
{"text":"Great little find. Service was not very good but the food more than made up for that. My husband got the breakfast platter and the grits were wonderful. I had a waffle which was ok. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent! I've read through the reviews.. if you get there early early..... Dana isn't a morning Bird so occasionally her first customers or two may not hear the music that chef mind of hers is worried about all of those lunch people threatening her life over shrimp and grits, she's often running around getting soups started because they are made from scratch. And really dude? Who likes pancakes? Dana makes Belgium waffles from scratch trust me I've watched her myself! And the syrup bottle.... you must have needed a lot of syrup sir because it's a 2 gallon bottle... cough. Anyway, great food and good service for a cafe striving to be a restaurant! I know when I go I'm gonna wait 30 min but I know when I leave I'm gonna be dying to go back soon. Gotta call every Friday for those shrimp and grits and reserve!!!! Talk about yummy"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend or breakfast. We ordered coffee, which was not ready. We had to wait for it to brew, which was quite a long time. I ordered pancakes, and after waiting for a while the lady/owner/chef came out and informed us that she only has three stoves and because it was busy she couldn't make pancakes. WHAT? Don't PUT IT ON THE MENU IF YOU DONT HAVE TIME TO MAKE IT. She substituted waffles, which turned out to be mediocre at best. They only had one bottle of syrup for the WHOLE place, despite having both pancakes and waffles on the menu, which I had to ask for. The cashier retrieved it for me, but they immediately came out of the kitchen to get it back because they use it to cook with and \"isn't for customer use.\"   Ill never, ever go back, despite the decent lunch reviews. It was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Great Soup and Sandwich.  The staff was super friendly while I was being indecisive, and told me all about the menu.  The sandwich I got was really good, and the side of Red Pepper soup was delicious.    You must get the Red Pepper soup!  I was not able to try the desserts, I was full, but they looked great."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other week and was not impressed. This place is a complete dump with terrible food that cost way too much. No worries on me ever returning here and I would not recommend it to anyone unless you want to waste your money."}
{"text":"Carm's Cafe is a hidden gem in Concord. I randomly found the place while visiting Concord's amazing antique gift shops. The sandwiches my girlfriend and I ordered were amazing. So amazing that we brought friends back up to Concord with the intent of having lunch there. Once again, the same great quality and great price.   The store itself is very relaxed. Sit where you want, refill your drink yourself at the machine, etc.  If you live in Uptown Charlotte or above I highly recommend making the drive up to Concord to dine here."}
{"text":"This is the surprise on Union Street that I have been looking for.  Excellent food and service.  My wife and I were there after looking at houses all morning last month.  She had the chicken avocado salad and I had the signature sandwich.  Both were excellent.  Good prices and great iced tea.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love their food, especially the sweet potato wrap. Unfortunately food prep is so incredibly slow."}
{"text":"I love Carm's. The food is absolutely delicious, and the soups never disappoint. Best shrimp and grits in town..get there early on Friday or they will be sold out. The owner knows all of her regulars and even if you've only been in a few times, she will remember what you got last time. Where else can you find service like that?  I find it strange that some reviewers say it is \"overpriced\" when the portions are larger than normal, everything is made from scratch, and the most expensive thing on the menu is around $10.  Maybe you shouldn't be going out to lunch if $10 is too expensive for you?  Anyway..great place."}
{"text":"Great delicious food. Service is a little slow but I like it.  It makes you slow down and relax. Homemade soups are very good as well."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu, healthy and filling. The service was fast and food reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Carm's cafe is an adorable little cafe with amazing food! It is a little small but the food is amazing. Service is a little slow but is usually pretty busy so makes since. Great for doing work you won't be rushed out. Customer service was very friendly and good is very affordable. I had a buffalo ranch spinach wrap and it was to die for. Their shrimp and grits is also amazing but you can only get it on fridays. All and all an amazing little cafe."}
{"text":"My wife and I had Lunch here today. We had a nice time at this family style restaurant. Our waitress was nice, the food homemade. The service is a little slow but the quality makes up the difference."}
{"text":"I came here with my husbamd. It took them over 20 minutes to serve us a bagel and an egg/cheese sandwich. The owner did apologize when we discussed this matter with her. However, based on other reviews (which i read just now) it seems that this is a chronic issie with this restaurant.  Aside from the poor service, the egg and cheese sandwich was nothing special. The bagel was standard."}
