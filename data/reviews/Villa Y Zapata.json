{"text":"I thought maybe this was a hidden gem, not at all! Food was okay, space is very dank, service was horrible! My dinner counterpart did not like her meal, the waitress' response: Sorry. After asking the item to be removed from the bill the waitress and owner literally argued with us since she had taken a few bites (how else can you tell you do/don't like something). A few days later, I'm noticing they ran my debit card twice. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I HATE this place--because it's ruining my diet. Every time I go back, I end up eating way too much! I can't help myself. My only complaint is that the portions are so big, I've barely scratched the surface of the menu, but everything I've had so far has been muy delicioso."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!  Some time ago I lived in the Cleveland area for a few years, and while there had the good fortune to become familiar with Villa Y Zapata on the west side.  Now living in another state, on my infrequent visits to Cleveland I often try to return to Villa Y Zapata for lunch or dinner.  I find that it has consistently offered the best authentic Mexican dining experience in Cleveland or anywhere else!  The food with its high quality and ample portions is the primary draw.  A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit.  The enchilada and flauta dishes are particular favorites of mine!  Be prepared to take leftovers home.  Service is low key, yet friendly and accommodating while being attentive but not overbearing.  The current facility is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business; very colorful, too.  There should be no problem finding it at the corner of Madison and West 85th Street!  Adequate secure private lot parking is available behind the restaurant, with driveway entry off West 85th.  I look forward to future dining opportunities at Villa Y Zapata!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I love mexican food so much and this place was out of the park. I had the potato and cheese chimichanga (which I've only every seen served at luchitas) and it was absolutely wonderful.MUST GO"}
{"text":"This is the real deal when it comes to authentic Mexican dining.  Having lived in Mexico City for many years, I can say that this is the best Mexican cooking north of the U.S. Mexico border.  The chiles rellenos cannot be beat.  The guacamole is made fresh and is fabulous.   Chicken enchiladas and the soup are the best.  Always consistently delicious.  Service is top notch.  Price is reasonable.  What more can you ask for?  Just don't fill up too much on the delicious table salsa and chips"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had East of the Mississippi. Quiet place with friendly staff. The owner chatted with us for quite a while. She clearly really loves what she does, and it shows in the food."}
{"text":"I just drove past the restaurant yesterday a and see that the odd front of the restaurant now has full windows!  It looks great and I plan go back and eat there again.  The windows give it s much more welcoming feel!!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican fare, nothing artsy or super special. Mexican food as it should be: fresh, tasty, with ample servings."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Mexican restaurant in Cleveland.  Don't be put off by the divey look of the exterior, which is a red, white, and green-striped brick building on the corner of Madison and West 85th.  This is a family operation, with the family living above the restaurant (or so I think).  I forget where in Mexico the family came from, but they brought all the wonderful flavor of home to Cleveland.  It's very much a mom-and-pop restaurant that is unpretentious and low key.  Here you'll find not only the \"typical\" Mexican fare like burritos, flautas, etc., but also more authentic dishes with mole (a rich sauce) and other things.  Everything I've tried in both categories was fantastic.  Guacamole is super fresh and delicious too.  Nice selection of Mexican beers.  Villa y Zapata has been in business for close to four decades--an amazing feat when it comes to restaurants.  They do so by serving every meal as though you're their special guest."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed!  Was skeptical, I can with 3 other people and everyone raved about the food.  If I want Mexican I am coming here!"}
{"text":"I am probably not going to provide any new insight into Villa y Zapata, but I am compelled to rate one of my favorite Cleveland restaurants.

I have tried roughly half of the menu and always left in a glorious food coma. Their margaritas have to be one of the most unique takes on the drink; I order a half pitcher any time I step foot inside. The atmosphere is very laid back with somewhat eclectic music overhead, occasionally some bizarre synthesizer traditionals. It never seems too busy, which is fine by me, but I would like to see them around for many more years to come.

Again, one of my favorite restaurants. Patronize this place if you're into good mexican food. Heck, patronize this place if you're into Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Always good.

The place I usually turn to when I need molé therapy...
Villa y Zapata recently constructed a window space in the front of the store, opening up the dining room and adding to its charming ambience. 
Reasonably priced, authentic food, and nice waitstaff. 
Best molé.
We're lucky to have our pick of delicious Mexican food in Cleveland: Mi Pueblo, Luchita's, even just picking up a taco at the weekend stands at La Plaza- Villa y Zapata is the best, though!"}
{"text":"Omg , I've tried almost every Mexican spot in the Cleveland area & never knew one of the best place was literally down the street from me . I've walked or driven past this place everyday of the 3 yrs I've lived on the west side always curious , but never gave them a shot til now . Disappointed at many of the othe Mexican spots , today I took a chance & I'm sooo happy I did .I'm not going to exaggerate or over embellish like I'm writing a novel . I'm just going to simply say this place is has good food & a nice , fun , friendly staff . I am now stuffed with tingling tastebuds yummz :P I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"stopped in tonight for the first time because of previous yelp post. Ordered the guac, I could have had 2 plates, so fresh. Food was great and not doused in sour cream or salsa because they have nothing to hide with quality food. The drive down there sucked, prepare to fall into a pot hole. Terrible roads."}
{"text":"One of tge easiest 5 stars ive given. This place is really amazing.

Just like some others pointed out, this place look like a horror show. It really was a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but more often than not, this is also the kind of place that will give you that serious, no pretentious, downright amazing food. 

We went for dinner on a monday evening. We drove past the place, couldnt find the place and thought we were lost. Turned out that the entrance wasnt in Madison Ave but by the other side of the road. Once we figured out how to get in, we were seated promptly. There was only one server, but she was very efficient. She handled all the tables with grace and very attentive.

We were immediately given chips and salsa. The salsa was amazing .. spicy and very flavorful. I havent had salsa this good for quite a while. 

We ordered guac, beef fajitas, tacos a la plancha, came con chile (as recommended by our server). The guac was reallllyyyyyyy good .. very creamy and full of flavor. All the food portion were huge so really good value for the money. Three of us could have just ordered 2 dishes and that would be more than enough, but oh well, our eyes are almost always bigger than our stomach. 

Tacos for me was just average, but once i slathered some of those awesome salsa, it became super good. Beef fajitas was sizzling hot on a hot plate. It was also full of flavor.

The star of the night though was Came con chile. We asked our server what would she recommend for something spicy, and she told us that this was her favorite. Boy were we glad we ordered that dish. It was really good, spicy, full of flavor. Beef was very tender, and the sauce was tomato-based, which we really liked. We loved this dish and would highly recommend. 

All in all, it was a wonderful experience. The service was really good and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on a number of occasions, typically for lunch.  The food is good, but not great...better than a Mexican fast food place but not as good as other \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants.  Since Villa Y Zapata rarely is crowded, service is good and the prices are fair.  I know some reviews rave about the mole sauce but again, to my taste it's good but not something I'd cross town for."}
{"text":"Very authentic atmosphere. The food was very good and reasonable price. I came out Lansing Michigan to pick up parts.  I will stop here again next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First off... I'm very confused why this restaurant has 4/5 stars overall. When we walked in it was extremely hazy/smoky and it never went away for the half hour we were there. I went to the bathroom while we waited and knew it was a mistake. The toilet was squeaky and not screwed down, there was no toilet paper dispenser, barely any soap in the dispenser, and the sink leaked and had almost no water pressure. We waited at the bar to be seated, ordered the house margarita and it was the WORST margarita I have ever seen. The color was very odd - almost like a lime green/electric blue color, almost resembling a cleaner. We took one sip of our margaritas and knew we had to leave. Again, very confused why this place has 4/5 stars. Usually hole in the wall places are some great finds but this was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Never experienced such horrible customer service. Felt very unwelcomed!"}
{"text":"Always a treat stopping by for food. So glad to see they are now open on Sundays. Decided to venture away from my usual choice and try the fajitas. The steak and shrimp fajitas were fantastic, and even better with Tecate. The gaucamole was great as well, and I'm not much of a guacamole eater. The staff is always great no matter who you get. Love the Villa."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!  My first time here and the food was very, very good. Service was good, especially considering it was Cinco de Mayo...it was packed and parking was a bit far, but I expected this for the holiday. A good variety of menu items, and I like the price range is quite inexpensive to moderate. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Staff was exceptional and the atmosphere was nice. However, I come to a restaurant for great food which we thought was mediocre at best. The salsa was good and had kick to it, but the remainder of our food didn't have enough flavor. The sour cream and guacamole was some sort of fake version. I didn't like anything about their rice at all."}
{"text":"Excellent half pitcher of margaritas gold. House made. No crappy mix. Victoria(server) says they make your face warm. They do. 
I had the chicken and steak fajitas. They were very good. The sauce was excellent. She (wifey)had chili rellenos and she enjoyed it very much. It was recommended by the server."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The best Mexican food I know, Friendly and down to earth! Great for get-togethers too!"}
{"text":"Yum! So good! Came here for the first time after passing by it and wondering what the heck is that place with the the crazy exterior (although I do love the plastic bottle flowers).  My boyfriend got the beef tips with jalapeño, cactus, potatoes and onion with a tomato sauce and I got shredded chicken with potatoes, onion, chipotle and sour cream and they were both amazing! We also got guacamole and that was delicious as well. Definitely coming back!! Prices aren't quite as low as other Mexican restaurants but the taste is way better!"}
{"text":"My family and I dined here last night.  Although the decor is a little worn, the food was great.  All of us enjoyed our meals, and the enchiladas with mole were fantastic.  The huarache with chicken, cactus and green salsa was exceptional and authentic.  This small, apparently family run Mexican place is definitely a cut above its Tex-Mex competitors in town.  We will be back."}
{"text":"TL;DR: the food was good but nothing special. Wife (Mexican-American) and I were confused why so many people were calling it 'authentic' - take it from my wife, this place was nowhere near authentic. Even judging by the low bar we set for Cleveland, this place didn't come close. They tried to pull a fast one on us for dessert and it really soured the entire experiance.

 I'd heard such great things about this place that my wife and I were excited to finally try it out a while back. We decided to go in for an early dinner around 5:30 on a weekend. When we arrived, we were impressed with the menu. They had nectar!! I was thrilled to finally have guava nectar at a restaurant. Now if only they had horchata.

The food was ok, good but nothing to write home about, until we got to dessert. My wife got sopapilla, which is her standard go to dessert. It was okay - what I've come to call \"sopapilla\". Most sopapilla in the area looks like cinnamon sugar tortilla chips, while sopapilla is normally made to be puffy (and normally is square/rectangular though not always) so the center is light and airy. I can live with that, as it's par for the course in the area. 

But my fried ice cream ... Was not fried ice cream. It was a scoop of plain vanilla surrounded by four \"sopapilla\" on the plate. It was essentially sopapilla a la mode. When I clarified with the server if thia was the fried ice cream, she confirmed. I was pretty stunned. I've had the dish everywhere from LA to Chicago to DC to Cleveland.  I knew it wasn't fried ice cream and have no idea if this is what they pass off as fried ice cream or if the person working couldn't make it (in which case, please just tell the customer. There's no need to serve me something I don't want and insult my intelligence). 

I'd recommend if you want a quick dinner or lunch cheap and arent looking for anything super authentic. I wouldn't recommend for service nor for dessert."}
{"text":"They are currently remodeling.  Yay...finally they will get some natural light in there.  Food was as good as always..."}
{"text":"I have been coming  here for 20 years and it is by far the best Mexican in Cleveland. Their verde sauce is so good I could drink it. An excellent mole as well. Oh and the salsa is one of my weekly addictions. Food can run on the saltier side so if you are sensitive mention it and avoid the soup. Other than that you can't go wrong with the traditional mex comfort foods like enchiladas and chimichangas. If you want a heartier meal go with the guisado de puerco- perfect tender pork in the delicious verde sauce I mentioned earlier."}
{"text":"I have eaten many Mexican Restaurants, but this one is the far BEST one in Town. GREAT FOOD AND VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE. I love several dishes but my favorite is the WET Burrito w/ Shredded Beef."}
{"text":"This is where I take family for Mexican Food when they come to town!  

It's good for meateaters, vegetarians, and vegans.  They're attentive and will remember if you ask for no cheese or sour cream on your food.  

A few things I really appreciate about the place are the guacamole and the variety or hot sauces!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update.... they've remodeled the front facade. Goodbye horror show, hello same brilliant Mexican food. 

I've done a lot of menu exploring over the past year and everything I've tried is amazing. My current favorite is the Dinner Huarache.

Pro tip: go on or around Cinco de Mayo and get their special stuffed poblano entree."}
{"text":"Best. Restaurant. In. Cleveland. This place has the best Mexican food in Cleveland. Anyone who says anything different should be put in a home for insane people. And the people that were already in that home should be put in a different home because they will realize how less insane they are than the guy who came in talking trash about VZAP. 

Carne con chile. Best plate of anything in the city."}
{"text":"Was expecting an authentic experience after seeing all of these reviews. Nothing about the meal or drinks were authentic. The margaritas were lime green and tastes as if someone mixed cheap tequila and lime coolaide. Food was equally bad. We were all surprised how awful it was."}
{"text":"This is now my new favorite place for Mexican in the area...sorry Nuevo Acapulco! You've been topped!  The chile rellenos are incredible.  They've spruced up the outside a bit since I went there years ago.  Parking is minimal so you may need to park on the street.  They have some of the strongest margaritas I've ever had.  We frequently drive 45 minutes just to come to this place.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Where I go for a delicious chimichanga or burrito. Free chips and salsa, affordable prices, and Coronas make for an excellent lunch/dinner spot I find myself at frequently."}
{"text":"Food is always good but had to take away a star because of a stupid 1 refill on your 16 oz pop rule (suks to have to ration your pop man!)... as well... only one refill on chips. Says so on the menu. LAME.  Great food tho for sure."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars!  WONDERFUL food, super nice staff and great atmosphere!  I met a friend there for my birthday lunch last year and the waitress went out of her way to make me feel special on my birthday!  I also went with a group of girlfriends for my bachelorette party and we were treated like royalty!  
GREAT food, GREAT, service GREAT restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for the first time... no complaints at all. Food and the service were great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got the soup which was incredible. I've never had whole pieces of avocado in soup before, but it was delicious. I got the con carne (beef). The beef was ultra tender and the tomato sauce was spicy and flavorful. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop restaurant with personable service. Once we were inside we helped ourselves to the seat as no one was there to greet. 
The salsa and chips were tasty, especially the salsa. 
The portion size for the entree was huge. Shrimp tacos were good, didn't care for the mashed beans. Tequila chicken with jalapeños was delicious. The alcohol is priced cheap and the double margarita was a humongous hangover inducing portion and be prepared to take Advil to avoid a headache the next day."}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem! Nothing fancy but the food is fabulous! They have this appetizer called Guacamole Mexicano, OMG, my husband and I like so much sometimes we get a second one to go for the next day.  LOL.   The Margarita menu is small, but tasty. The staff couldn't be nicer and they run their buns off for you.  Give it a try, turned you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mexican food at its best, and reasonably priced. Tacos, salsa, burritos everything is good. service is lacking at times but they get it done. The restaurant itself is tacky but, who cares if the food is good."}
{"text":"We were traveling to Cleveland from Indiana and this place was great  we were there 5 minutes after they opened yet the homemade chips and delicious salsa were brought to our table within minutes   The dinners followed quickly and both myself and my fiancé said they were the healthiest most delicious versions of tacos and chimichangas  almost forgot about the convenient location not far the Lake Eria. we would eat there again if given a chance"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I've been coming to Villa Y Zapata for years and it's fantastic. I had dinner there again earlier this week, and felt compelled to share my love for this quirky little place.

Villa Y Zapata's chile relleno ranks among the top 10 greatest things I have ever eaten in my life.  

If something went horribly wrong and I turned from being a peace-loving pacifist into a crazed, violent super villian who was captured and sentenced to be nixed in the big house after a dramatic high speed chase (that was undoubtedly peppered with explosions and maniacal laughter), Villa Y Zapata's chile relleno would be my final meal request.

If I should ever find myself crawling on my belly to the safety of Edgewater's shore after bobbing helplessly for days in mighty Lake Erie, I would summon the strength to make it to the brighly striped facade of Villa Y Zapata so I can feast on this plate of magic.

This place is a gem in our wonderful city, and it deserves your business."}
{"text":"Every time I go the food is amazing and authentic.  The prices are great, note that there are some special rules for using coupons there. It's not is the best part of town so be smart when parking. 

Last week I ordered my usual potato and spinach chimichanga along with a cheese enchilada w/ mole sauce. The fried ice cream is perfect for sharing because they serve it on cinnamon sugar toasted tortilla shells. 

The service is always on point also, and the bathroom is CLEAN!!!!"}
{"text":"You really can't beat Villa Y Zapata for the price. Fresh, good quality, and cheap. I've had both the wet burrito and the steak fajitas and they were excellent and very filling."}
{"text":"Came here for Cinco De Mayo 2016, arrived about 5:30 pm, seated right away. Great food, the beef tacos are great, I ordered the mole chicken enchilada it was okay, not bad but I loved my beef taco. My boyfriend ordered the ground beef enchiladas, very good. The guacamole salad was very good."}
{"text":"Take out or dine in, these ladies know what's up when it comes to authentic Mexican yummies. 

And by ladies I mean the last time I ate there the owner and her daughter actually came to our table to make sure everything was delicious! We ordered too much food and couldn't eat it all (pretty big portions here, folks)--they noticed and were worried we didn't enjoy ourselves. On the contrary! We were gluttonous and left full and happy. But I appreciated the attention--and the fact that they offered to take some of the food off our bill, which we politely declined--after reassuring them everything was awesome, of course.

This is not a fancy restaurant by any means. It's definitely a little \"hole-in-the-wall\" ish, but not nearly as bad as some of the diners I've been to. Sometimes your arms stick to the tables or the menus, but the food makes up for it. Also, I hear some complaints about the area, but I've never had a problem. 

My guy swears by their chicken taquitos, but I'm always trying something different. Their chicken burrito is great, I love their salsa and really I haven't had anything I didn't like here. Take out orders are usually ready in under 15 mins. And some might gripe about only one or two free baskets of chips and salsa before they charge you, but come on. Think about what you're complaining about. I'm sure you'll see you sound silly. Two FREE large portions are more than enough, and it's not like they have that limited for large parties. 

Also.. they have a parking lot. Free, ample parking is such a nice luxury!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the finest Mexican food in Ohio. I have been frequenting this establishment for the last 20+ years and nothing can beat the quality of food. There was a change in ownership about a decade ago, but everything is just as wonderful as it has always been.

I make it a point to bring friends here and they are always impressed at how good and authentic a good number of the selections are. The standout dish is the Chiles Rellenos. This is by far the best I've had outside of Mexico and SoCal. 

Other highlights are the sopes, tinga poblana, shredded beef tacos dorados and their cheese enchiladas with mole."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I'm not sure why this place is so hyped up.
Based on the many reviews, I drove an hour and 15 minutes just to try this place.
Good food, but certainly not \"to die for\" good.
The best part was the salsa, which I would rate as excellent.
Entrees are pricey, $11-$13, mostly.
It's rare that a Mexican restaurant will not give unlimited chips and soft drinks, but this one doesn't.
One refill on the drinks and one refill on the chips and after that they want more pesos!
I got 3 burritos(1chicken, 1beef, and 1bean). The chicken and beef burritos had absolutely no seasoning, just very bland. The bean burrito was the best of the 3.
My wife got a wet burrito and my son got the chili con carne.
Both were very unimpressed. The food was not bad-tasting, just more like \"no taste at all.\" I sampled their food and agreed.
Compared to the 2 Mexican restaurants I went to in Arizona last year(I was hoping this place would be comparable to them), this place isn't even close.
Yes, I was greatly disappointed, but I am going to Arizona again this year, and all will be well."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. But it did not live up to the d hype.

Service - four stars 
Server was friendly. She appeared to be the only one around, though, so a few refills went missed. Otherwise she was prompt and courteous.

Food - Two Stars
I was eager to try self-proclaimed \"authentic Mexican food\" in the nearby Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood. As an appetizer for the table, we ordered \"Mexican guacamole.\" Someone in the back went crazy on the onion that it overwhelmed the dish. That was ok with me bc I don't mind onion but if you hate onion, you'll hate this dish. One in my party ordered fajitas. Flavors were on point there. I wished I had gotten that. It was served with flour tortillas and beans and rice. And another got a guisado bistec which is a steak dish with beans and rice and it was all too salty for her. I ordered a super greasy pork and potato dish with red sauce. It was OK on the flavor, nothing special, but it was heavily greasy. 

Value - one star
Compared to other local \"authentic Mexican\" restaurants, this place is pricy. Pop for two (other had waters) and the dishes above plus tip were $60+. And what we had was not worth $20/person. Additionally, the item which prompted me to write this section is the nickel and diming. To be fair, it's all on the menu but still irked me. Only one refill on fountain drinks and extra cost for chips.

Atmosphere - Two stars
While it has its own lot, it fills up fast. So you have to park on the street if it's full and that area is a little sketchy."}
{"text":"i cannot believe there is only one review of this place before mine. seriously. 
this is the best mexican joint in cleveland. 

the building itself is fantastic. It is painted in green, white and red strips resembling the Mexican flag. It's awesome!!!

The margaritas are killer. The best around, and they are neon!

Vegan/Vegetarian friendly. It's a great place to take visitors for some authentic Mexican. The prices are decent, the portions are huge. 
I LOVE the wet burrito. All the burritos are good. The vegans i know love the veggie fajitas or the bean burritos (no cheese). 

I don't have any \"dancing with the stars\" stories to add, but if it's your birthday, you should totally go here. You get to wear a sombrero and have your picture put on the wall. You also get a fantastic ice cream dessert.

I love Villa. Forever."}
{"text":"We went to Villa Y Zapata because my son's girlfriend said she heard from another person that the food was really great. Not!  First of all good luck in finding a place to park.  Their lot is so small we park a block away on a side street.  Wasn't sure I would find my car when we got back to it.  For what they charge you think the food would have had some flavor.  I ordered the 2 Burrito combo, so I could get the rice and re-fried beans.  There was so much grease under the burritos, it was very unappetizing.  The fountain Pepsi had a funny taste to it (I know my Pepsi).  I am not sure, but I'll bet they don't remember the last time they cleaned the hand held dispenser.  For what you pay you really don't get much food and it lacks flavor.  The food was extremely bland, and greasy.  My son had the fajitas platter and it was an extremely small portion for what you pay.  My husband had the chicken salad, never again.  We had the guacamole and it had no taste what so ever.This is one place we would not return to.  Of course my son and his girlfriend, when I asked what would you give this place on a scale of 1 -10 they said 7.  My son nerve agrees with me. lol.  My husband and I would give it a 4."}
{"text":"Solid and affordable food. We come here several times a year. Mostly carry out, but service is always good. Recommended, as I tried a pork chop dish this week. Flavors were great and I think they do a pretty consistent job."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy but the food is amazing. It's not well equipped to deal with a large group of people (from a prior experience) but they are fine for 7 or less. 

I recently had dinner with 2 friends. I highly recommend the mole sauce! Their guacamole is really tasty but only game with about 5 chips. They brought me a basket of them once I asked, but let me know that I was only allowed one refill of chips (& complimentary salsa) without being charged. The chips aren't anything to write home about (Trader Joe's house tortilla chips with lime are far superior, but I'm also biased because those chips are among some of my favorite munchies). 

The enchiladas are always amazing and I appreciate how much of the menu is vegetarian friendly. At least 1/3 of the menu (I'm guessing on that number, I'm not great at math) can be made vegetarian, with chicken or beef."}
{"text":"No Frills, Good food.

The salsa was delicious and had just enough spice to it. I had the chile rellenos as my main course. The meal came with 2 decently sized chile rellenos, rice and re-fried beans. One chile relleno would have probably been enough for me! Definitely enough food for the price."}
{"text":"Some of my more timid friends get sketched out going to this neighborhood because the only news coming out of this area is bad news. Bunch of namby-pamby babies... 

Reminds me of someones grandparents basement. The kind where they have one of those bars where your their grandma likes to make people drinks. Except this one has really good mexican food. And margaritas that look a lot like lime Kool-Aid.  It's almost the same green as the stripes on the outside of the building.

Don't panic when you get there and try to open the front door and it's locked. You are supposed to enter through the rear of the building by their tiny parking lot. 

I love when people exclaim how this place is \"authentic\"... Have you seen the paint on this place? Of course it's authentic."}
{"text":"My wife and I came upon this place while trying to go out on an impromptu date night.   I must say that the reviews were very accurate, but not enough of them touch on the overall atmosphere.  The people are great, the inside deco is festive and not overwhelming. Our waitress was amazingly pleasant and extremely sweet and attentive. 
But the food is why we went an everything else was a nice surprise.  The food was worth traveling through the shitty February  weather Cleveland  has seemed to want to embrace. My wife had enchiladas and I had (upon recommendation) the carne (it was spivey cubed beef, I wish I could remember exactly what it was called).  My wife's was gobbled up and mine was hot, but the best kind of hot, the kind you want to eat and not because of a dare.  We will definitely be back and most likely with friends."}
{"text":"Since this Mexican restaurant is pretty close to where my boyfriend lives, I was pretty excited to try it. I ordered a Potato Chimichanga and it was fantastic and exactly what I would have wanted. While I would have loved for the chips to have been warmer for the salsa, what I just can't get over is how bad the margaritas were. I'm a huge marg lover and was so disappointed in how they looked (a weird shade of green) and tasted (almost like they were made with limeade)."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Northeast Ohio. They are not the fastest, and they run very lean with staff, but they are very friendly, and the food is always worth the wait. Portion sizes are on the larger side so you will not leave still feeling hungry. The large combo is an easy way to try a number of their menu items. The Chili Rellenos is the best around."}
{"text":"Best fajitas I had in a while! Great frozen margaritas and salsa. Great service.don't let local deter you."}
{"text":"Went here randomly with my boyfriend one night and was incredibly happy with how authentic it was. Chicken chimichanga was amazing!"}
{"text":"This one of Cleveland's best kept secrets. Ive been going here since I was a little kid and have been telling my gringo friends that you have never had good Mexican in NEO until you have been to this place. 
First of all the salsa is extremely good (& hot) I could drink the stuff. Secondly, their chile rellenos are the best I've ever had in my entire life, you have got to try them they're addictive. I recommend the taquitos & if your feeling a little under the weather their chicken soup is very good. Also the margaritas are unique ( not the overly sweet/sour shit u usually get) and they have a kick Good $ to alc content ratio lol. Also u cannot ask for better service at this place. They are all very unpretentious 2nd third generation Clevelanders and are very friendly. Last but not least, u cannot beat their prices, much cheaper (and just as good if not better in my opinion) than Luchitas. Not that I don't like Luchitas, just saying. All in all this is not just a good Mexican restaurant but a great restaurant in general."}
{"text":"We had a nice size group there on 11-19-11. Atmosphere is nice. Service is borderline laughable. Our server was bringing out food and had no clue what went where. At one point she said, \"Oh well, you guys will figure it out\". She left out plates on the table after we finished until we had to ask her to take stuff away. The food was in no way special. Totally average Mexican food. I stood at the bar when I first came in and waited close to 10 minutes for someone to even come out of the kitchen to tend the bar. I finally waived down someone and told them I had money i was willing to spend to get a beer. I finally got one. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Cleveland.  Delicious guacamole and chilaquiles!!  Love the feel of the restaurant, definitely feels like you've stepped outside of McMexican!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out last Friday. I thought it was really great! Nothing fancy inside or out but fantastic Mexican food. We both ordered the fajitas, steak and chicken. The flavors were on point and a good amount of meat to peppers and onions. The service started somewhat slow as it was quite busy but she came back and checked on us quite a few times once we got our drinks. For drinks I ordered a basic on the rocks margarita while my husband ordered the margarita topped with a corona. In my opinion, I would order his next time because I thought my margarita was a bit sweet. I tend to like them more on the sour side. Other than that, we definitely plan on coming back! I highly suggest checking this place out"}
{"text":"'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies. And I never been to Mexico. I imagine Mexico would be a lot more like Villa Y Zapata and a lot less like the restaurants that use the super bright paint and all look the same (El Jalapenos, Cozumel etc...). The exterior paint job is impressive as the food itself. The pricing is pretty standard for Mexican ($10-$13). The guacamole add on for $2 is well worth it."}
{"text":"I recently moved to a condo by W 65th so I had driven past this place multiple times so I called to see if they had take out one busy week day night.  And they did, so i was happy to hear my order could be pickup in 15 minutes.

Since I was expecting some dirty, greasy Tex-Mex, I gave them four stars because they delivered the the quality of Tex-Mex I expected from a cheap locally run mexican restaurant. The guac was good, refied beans, rice and fajitas were tastey and cooked as expected.  They are no means a Momocho but if you are looking for a quick, greasy Tex-Mex with fast pickup, large portion & cheap meal they wont disappoint.   The staff is friendly (offered me a shot of Jose as I waited for my food to be finished),"}
{"text":"my honey will probably kill me for posting this review, as out favorite spot could become compromised in some way by perhaps an influx of business preventing us from getting our favorite booth right away....BUT, as a business owner, i understand the importance of good word of mouth and i LOVE this place.  I am no foodie, in fact, if my parents or close friends even caught wind of the fact that I, Danielle DeBoe, am writing restaurant reviews, they probably would just not believe it and maybe even fear for the business, but that said....it is a mexican restaurant, family owned and operated and while i cannot speak to whether or not its the most authentic or more innovative or more anything than any other mexican restaurant, i can say with the increasing number of mexican restaurants popping up around town, we still come here once a week...(this or Luchitas's which is also a favorite).  Their margaritas may be glow in the dark green but they sure are tasty and the chicken fajitas or enchiladas ( the only things i ever order) are delicious.  if it is quiet enough you may even get special commentary by the staff on the spanish version dancing with the stars, which is sure to be on during a visit."}
{"text":"First time newb to this place. They were remodeling their storefront at the time of my visit. Got the chicken burrito and shredded beef taco's. Everything was great. Authentic and meat marinated well with very good flavor. Price reasonable and credit card friendly. Service was excellent. They appreciated my business and treated me like the mayor of a city. As I was leaving the kitchen staff yelled out the door \"thank you for coming\". One of the top tier mexican places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Strayed away from my usual Mexican spot to give this place a try. Wasn't OVERLY impressed, but I was satisfied. 
First, just know that the location is not the greatest, but inside is cozy and clean enough. Our server was incredibly nice and gave us good service. We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas for $10, which were good (but potentially made from margarita mix?) and the bottled root beer (just mediocre in my opinion). 
The chips were something akin to Tostitios, I've had wayyy better chips at Mexican restaurants before but the salsa and guac were to die for. The salsa had just the right kick to it, and it was obvious that the guac was super fresh and made to order. 
We also had an order of beef empanadas to start- a little bland and lacking seasoning in my opinion. 
For the main course, we ordered pollo en salsa de tequila- a medley dish made with a tequila sauce which was DELISH, and the enchiladas verdes which were smothered in delicious cheese and verde sauce, and filled with big chucks of juicy chicken. The rice and beans were also quite good. 
Overall, I did think the price point was a bit high for the location/atmosphere, but the food was pretty satisfying, and we got great service so I would recommend for a place that's off the beaten path, but still pretty good!"}
