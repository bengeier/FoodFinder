{"text":"We came here for my mom's 80th bday  It was our first time there. Reservations were made for 10 and we were seated promptly at 7pm on a sunday night. The restaurant was somewhat quiet but we weren't complaining since most restaurants are usually too noisy.  We ordered a lot of food. Everyone ordered a plate for themselves and also lots of rolls and sashimi to share. The rolls were amazing and also hugh. One of our guests has never eaten sashimi before and she loved it ( she couldn't believe raw fish can taste so good and not fishy at all).   The price was not the cheap but the food and service were very good. Our 20 something kids enjoyed it so much that they went back there a week after for more and introduced a friend to this place.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We recently moved into Markham and we are always up for trying a new sushi restaurant. We came here from friends recommendation and we are glad we did. Lunch combos are great; quality, selection and the amount of sushi you get - big fat rolls of sushi. Presentation is nice but service is better. I don't usually expect great service from the typical sushi joint but this set it apart. Staff was very attentive and made the stay enjoyable. Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner any time."}
{"text":"4.5  The BF and I came here on the 13th before V-day to celebrate early and avoid the crowds. We had previously tried to Mi Ne in Richmond Hill and liked it so we thought we'll give this one a try. Not sure if they are related, the food and menus looks similar but they have different websites and the RH location doesn't appear on their place mat?    Happy Boat (for 2people) $60 16 sushi, 21 maki, 12 sashimi, 2 miso soups & 2 green salads  Got this to share. Prices are slightly more expensive then the RH location and other sushi restaurants in the area. Sushi and sashimi were decently fresh and a good size(sashimi not too thin & fish to rice ratio good for sushi). I liked that the rice were thin in the maki rolls, but they were huge! Took me 2-4 bites to finish each one! BF really likes the way they make the spicy salmon roll. 49 pieces would usually be a good amount to make us comfortably full, but we were stuffed. Dinner also came with oranges as dessert, which was good for us to help with digestion. Haha.     The ambience was nice, more modern looking then the RH one. It was around 7:30pm on a Friday night and it wasn't empty but it wasn't crowded either so noise level was good for a nice and quiet pre-V-day dinner. Service was good. We were given a small 2 person table at first. The boat came and it was so big, it crowded the table, so they dragged over another 2 person table so we could eat more comfortably. The waitresses came to check on us several times. One offered to bring us more tea and forgot, but when we asked again she quickly got us our own pot.   It was V-day so they gave us a cute little paper rose at the end of dinner. Bonus points for this little extra touch. Overall I like the ambience of this location more, BF thinks the food at the RH location is slightly better. But I think I'll come back to this one if I want a nice quiet dinner with friends. There is also wifi w/ password."}
{"text":"I have come here quite a few times and am consistently impressed with the quality of food and service. This time, my friend and I ordered Lobster Roll and Salmon Lover Roll Fresh (along with some others) and they were some of the best rolls I have ever had. They are huge and are filled with many ingredients and minimal rice.   When I am there (mostly around 7 during weekday), noise level is usually moderate as the restaurant is neither too crowded nor empty.   Parking isn't a problem since there are plenty of parking spaces in the plaza.  Overall, the food does seem to be slightly overpriced but it was all worth it."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi and never fails to satisfy my sushi cravings! I highly recommend the Orangeville Roll, my all time favourite, with salmon, avocado, rice, spicy scallop, and a tobiko mixture inside. Although it's a bit pricey for a roll ($16), the portions are big and very filling. We also got the Love Boat (~$60), and could not finish everything between two people. The sashimi was very fresh, and had a large variety. It consisted of salmon, tuna, white salmon, butter fish, and more.   The atmosphere here is fairly quiet, and seating is comfortable. The service was pretty good, but nothing above and beyond. I have been here many times, and will continue to come here! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered my go to chirashi here and the fish was pretty good, fresh enough for a neighborhood place, especially considering the lack of any decent places north of Highway 7 in Markham.  My only complaint was the sushi rice was still warm, bordering on hot.  Took away from the enjoyment of the chirashi, will definitely give them another shot as it could have just been bad timing on my part."}
{"text":"Regular costomer here. Much better to eat here then buffet if you have kids. Variety of food with good quality. Have lunch bento that made me full."}
{"text":"Off the recommendation of a friend, I had decided to visit this sushi restaurant. The first time I came, I ordered three hand rolls: California Hand Roll, Saki Maki Roll, and the Unagi Maki Hand Roll. All of the hand rolls were delicious. The California Hand roll had an abundance of filling, huge avocado slices and cucumber and imitate crab meat. The Sake Maki Hand Roll (Salmon Hand Roll) was amazing. Inside had many thick slices of salmon sashimi, almost feeling that you were eating just pure salmon sashimi. Lastly, the Unagi Maki Hand Roll (Grilled Eel Hand Roll) was also very delicious. Coming with an abundance of perfectly grilled eel and avocado, it was probably one of the best hand rolls I have eaten in the Greater Toronto Area.   My second trip here, I had ordered the Maki Set A, which consisted of 6 pieces of California Rolls and 9 pieces of dynamite roll. This maki set also came with miso soup and their green salad. The soup and salad were average, but their sushi rolls are amazing. Each piece was roughly double the size of any maki roll you get at a sushi buffet. Also, these rolls were 85% filling to 15% rice. The California Rolls had a huge piece of avocado, a piece of imitate crab meat, and quite a bit of fish roe and cucumber. The Dynamite Rolls had shrimp tempura, salmon sashimi, cucumber, avocado, and fish roe. Both these rolls were delicious and extremely filling.   If you want to come on a Friday/Saturday evening, be prepared to wait a while as this place get very packed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food is consistently delicious! The best maki rolls are the Orangeville Roll, Golden Dragon Roll and Spicy Scallop Roll. Other memorable items are the beef udon, beef gyoza and kalbi.   Today I ordered off the lunch menu and for $13, I got the Spicy Scallop and Spicy Salmon Maki Set. The portion was fairly large, especially for lunch--12 pieces of sushi (6 of each roll and the rolls are huge), plus a miso soup and salad.   I went to Mi Ne for dinner last month with a group of 6 people. We received \"gifts from the chef\"--deep fried salmon pieces and two kinds of tuna tartar. None were standout dishes, but it was a kind gesture to receive free food, even though we were so full from the food we actually ordered.   The wait staff is friendly, but service can be slow. Overall, the quality of food trumps the service and I will continue to come back. However, I would not recommend eating here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Feb 2016 - Work lunch Orangeville Roll (9 pcs) Spicy scallop roll, warpped with fresh salmon, tobiko & avocado  Tuna Lover Roll (9 pcs) Fresh spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, tobiko wrapped with fresh tuna  Sashimi 13 pieces of assorted raw fish  Shrimp Tempura 6 pieces of deep fried shrimp"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special and was pleasantly surprised with the portion size and the quality of the fish.  I had Scallops sushi, Salmon nigiri which should have been colder.. And Tuna Maki which was good.  However - service, service, service...!  Although the servers are running back and forth tables are not cleared in timely manner, water request can take you to the end of the meal and then waiting for the check once you are done is really annoying   I will probably come back for the food but will do it either later or sooner in the day to avoid long wait"}
{"text":"Before I came here, I heard bad things. I heard it wasn't fresh and the sushi/sashimi was soggy.  FORTUNATELY, that was not the case. I went in and was surprised at how nice the decor was. It looked pretty clean and I loved how they had a button to press for service. I ordered the sashimi and sushi dinner and when the plate came, it was HUGE. and it wasn't just portion size, but the slices for the sashimi were thick. I was thoroughly happy with my meal, because the meat tasted cool and fresh.  For me, I didn't finish it because i don't eat alot....but my brother (who does eat alot) finished his sashimi and sushi AND mine as well. So for someone who eats alot, I'd suggest you to get a combo with roll of some sort.  Anyways, I'll probably come back sometime. It's pricey, but for special occasions...I'll find a way."}
{"text":"Been going to Mi*Ne a looooong time. Stopped after the owner sold the one on Yonge at Elgin Mills. They changed things, started cutting corners. Found his other one in New Market area and this one on Woodbine. Back to the amazing quality and huge rolls. A quick lunch turned into two hours and a much needed nap. I've prob eaten at Mi*Ne 100 times.  Always amazing except for the surprise of the sold location. Bremner is also franchised out. I went there, asked if Mitch is the owner, nope. He said they try but aren't able to keep the high standards of Mitch  ( the owner ) due to size of location. Still really really good but not amazing."}
{"text":"Sorry...  This table is double booked for seven o'clock,  so you need to leave.  This is what the server told us at the end of our meal, at 7:10pm,  after I had already asked another server for the bill. We had a 6pm reservation, and showed up on time.  Does it matter how the food tasted after being told get lost after an hour and ten minutes on a Saturday night?   Needless to say we won't ever be coming back,  especially as their food is nothing to write home about and there are literally dozens of competing restaurants of similar average quality in the area, however surely with more class than this place."}
{"text":"Customer service is ridiculous. Had to wait 25 minutes to get my order. Am not impressed"}
{"text":"After traveling to the land of the rising sun, I have earned a the title of a sushi snob which means I get to go try sushi in the GTA and say crap like \"this sushi taste nothing like the sushi in Tokyo!\" and then pad myself in the back like I just landed on the moon.  With that said, I'm also a cheap skate that don't want to pay for authentic sushi so I depend on Yelp for affordable sushi that can satisfy my mini sushi craving.  What I have noticed recently is that there are more and more sushi restaurants opening up in Markham and Richmond Hill; not just sushi buffet anymore, like actual sushi bars.  After seeing that Mi Ne is $$ with decent review, we decided that this will be the sushi place that we'll walk in and complain about how we miss the sushi in Tokyo.  The décor here actually aren't that far off from the décor in Tokyo, I think Mi Ne actually looks better.  Service here is efficient too.  They follow the Korean style of ringing the bell whenever you need servicing.  We started with the dumpling and ordered a dragon roll and 18 piece sashimi for main.  Quantity and quality was excellent.  My only critique is that the cut of the sashimi pieces was too thick which leaves you chewing for a while and you end up soaking in all the fish flavor; at least we're full, right?  I really can't give this place a 4 star because it is a little deceiving for anyone to think they'll come here for good sushi.  3 star for the good value and service.  Oh, how I miss Tokyo."}
{"text":"Watch out if you order take out from this location. Second time in a row we ordered multiple items only to find out they did not give us everything we ordered and paid for after we got home. Tonight we ordered the Sushi sashimi combo (should come w 6 sushi + 6 maki rolls and sashimi), apple cider roll and two hand rolls. Came home to find all the maki rolls missing. Called them about it and they insisted they check everything was there, they don't seem to know maki rolls is on the combo.  Too bad I don't think we are ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in the GTA.  The raw stuff is fresh tasting.  The rolls are large, made with good ingredients and are well put together.  I also tried their salmon terriyaki.  It was a huge portion.  Three large pieces of salmon.  There is a 10% discount when paying by cash."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. They have been able to keep consistency in their quality of food and service. The rolls are absolutely amazing. My wife and I tend to get their Orangeville roll. Though on the pricier side, the size of the dish and the taste is well worth the price. They offer great deals for sets as well as great discounts during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch but did not order from the lunch menu. Ordered a few apps, the loveboat combo and udon.  Sushi/sashimi was ok but nothing special. I found the rolls to be too large for my liking. The tempura batter used in some of my maki rolls and veggie tempura was a little thick/hard. Wasn't light and crispy at all. The only thing I really enjoyed about the meal was the steamed clams/oyster app.   Service was good and attentive though, they gave us a grilled salmon head on the house."}
{"text":"Ordered a combination platter. Everything was fresh and most excellent. Service was good and beer was cold. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our favourite Japanese restaurant.  Not for the ambiance per se, it looks like a typical Japanese Restaurant, but the quality of fish here is superior.   The maki are large and not overloaded with rice, and the selection of special rolls is plentiful.  Particular favorites: Mine Tower Garden Roll Torch Rainbow Dragon Roll"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night for dinner.  We made reservations for our group of 4 but they didn't have our reservation noted.  After some back and forth with the wait staff (at one point the even asked us to leave the table we were already seated at), we finally settled into our seat.  It's a good thing they have a call button, because even with the call button we had a difficult time getting the attention of a server.  Sub-par service aside, the sushi really speaks for itself.   We ordered a medium combination platter (83 pieces of sushi, maki & sashimi) - this platter was ~$90.  The quality of the fish here is really awesome - good substantial size, fresh and sweet.  There's also a really good variety of different fish in the platter.  It was a struggle to finish the whole boat.  The service left much to be desired, but with the high quality and great value of the food we will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to for maki rolls! Their rolls are humongous and they have a large variety for you to choose from. My favorite has to be the Orangeville and Alaska rolls. Bonus: If you come during happy hour between 2:30-5:00, you get 10% off sashimi/20% off other items + 5% off if you pay in cash!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have personally been to. The spicy salmon and Boston roll are a must try if you're overwhelmed by all the yummy options. You better make reservations because the place gets really busy on the weekend! As busy as they are, the service was great. I'd definitely bring friends here."}
{"text":"Portions are good for the price paid. Sashimi is fresh and the udon is a must! Definitely better than AYCE."}
{"text":"Possibly because Mi-Ne is not an AYCE Japanese restaurant, I was impressed with the portion and quality of the sashimi and sushi here! Granted, the menu is a bit pricey but I have no complaints about the food!  We ordered the Love Boat to share with a side order of the Lobster Roll - our total came out to be around $90.The variety on the Love Boat is pretty decent - around two to three slices of different types of sashimi and two to three different types of maki rolls. This order comes with complimentary miso soup and salad. The portions are enormous (my friend's chirashi ($17) was served in a gigantic bowl that was packed with a good mix of sashimi) so to say the least, I was just as full as I would've been at an AYCE.   The only complaint I have is the service here - they're all really nice, but don't understand English too well. Apparently they have a policy of NOT writing down your name when they take your reservation over the phone... This location isn't too busy, so we're lucky to get a table right away otherwise I'd have walked out and never get to try the deliciousness they have to offer.   The plaza Mi Ne is located in has plenty of parking which is another reason I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is very unique and I haven't had anything quite like it before. It was super tasty and I find that the fish that they used was very fresh, which is of course what you would want. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and I cannot emphasize how delicious their sushi is. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Worth to try at least once but I don't think I could come here again. This place is on the pricier end of sushi places and although the quality is good, I don't think it made up for it. Our group made reservations for 4 for 7pm on a Friday night which is recommended because it does get busy. We ended up ordering a medium sushi boat which gave us approximately 80 pieces and also split a salmon udon as well. Overall between the 4 of us, it was $27 after tax and tips. Service was ok and we got our food fairly quickly."}
{"text":"There were too many tempuras in all the maki rolls. The fish didn't taste much. The maki rolls I ordered was big, but if they didn't taste much then what is the point. The tempura flakes just killed the taste of all the other ingredients.   The employees were really nice, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Service - good, prompt  Food - good, fresh, presentation was nice. 4 of us shared a large combination platter, thinking we could each eat 25 pieces of sushi/roll/sashimi, but the rolls were bigger than expected.... did not finish lol. It was really good and presentation was pretty. Some other friends got the udon and other hot dishes, and they looked and smelled really good.  Price - higher than what I'm used to, but I can also see why, the experience was great and I had nothing to complain about.  I would return if there was a special occasion or something to celebrate, but the price is a little high for me personally to come on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Prices have increased a lot since I last visited a couple months ago.  One of the best things about Mi-Ne was the fact that the pricing was OK - not so low that it was sketchy, and not so high that it was only for more specific occasions (vs. dining here cause it's on the way to where ever).  The quality was also acceptable, neither horrible nor amazing.  My favourite thing about Mi Ne is the single piece of raw oyster in the sashimi boat.  But now that the prices are comparable to other, higher-quality Japanese restaurants in the area, I can't really find a particular reason to choose Mi Ne over the other spots."}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest sushi I've had in Markham. Prices aren't too bad, but it gets quite busy during the rush hours for lunch and dinner. Portions are decent. Their boats and rolls are really good. If you pay with cash, they offer 10% off."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with friends and family. Service is always good but restaurant does get really busy as Japanese places are limited in the area.   I really enjoyed their specialty maki rolls as they come in gigantic pieces - I like how they're not stuffed with rice but mainly ingredients. Their sashimi comes in huge chunks as well. Another popular dish is their avocado crab meat salad; it is quite refreshing.   You'll get a discount if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"Other than sushi and sashimi, this restaurant is promoting their summer desserts. They have puddings."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the original Richmond Hill one because it is much more comfortable to sit at. As always,  their sushi is top notch. I can't vouch for their cooked food because I've never eaten it at any of their locations... Their Maki also has an excellent filling to rice ratio and are always rolled perfectly tight.  Came here on a Tuesday night and ordered the fresh uni. They gave us an extra piece on the house!  Plus free WiFi!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant, the menu has tons of options varying from sushi, to warm dishes, to udon dishes, I really recommend this restaurant if you live in the area."}
{"text":"The specialty maki rolls offered here are probably one of the best I've had! Their specialty makis are so tasty, it leaves me wanting to come back again just try them all out! I have tried the snowman roll, salmon lover roll, and the one with the cream cheese in it. My taste buds were tantalized by the flavours and combinations of all the ingredients. It was truly blessing to have tasted and devoured such yummy sushi. Both the salmon and rice were fresh, which I was super pleased about. The only drawback of this sushi restaurant is the slow service. The staff are quite friendly, but I find I ended up waiting for my food much longer than I expected (20-25mins)."}
{"text":"Went her during lunch, a couple of times. Went to this location once and the one in Richmond Hill the next. Now this place has very LARGE sushi pieces which is great. And the actual sushi does taste really good. However, a couple of things I didn't like we're that the lunch menus don't have a good variety. At gals sushi u can get several different types of sushi and things likes noodles and potatoes inside your box. Here there is no option like that. Not to mention it is a bit pricier. Definitely would come back but eh."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food came out on time so there wasn't much room to complain about anything for my guest and I here. Parking was quick and easy, and left within a reasonable timeframe before they closed for the night."}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  Originally, I was going to Le Modern Japanese Cuisine. For some reason, the GPS led us to the middle of an industrial area. We changed our minds and went to Mi Ne Japanese Restaurant. When I walked into the restaurant, it was very stuffy and it seemed like there was no air conditioner in the store. Given it was 35 degrees today, I felt like I was in an oven and actually had trouble breathing. I didn't have a huge appetite to eat.   -- Food and Drink --  We ordered 2 rolls:  1. (SM16) Green Dragon Roll (9 pieces) $15 - I don't get to eat at Japanese restaurants a lot because my husband only eats California rolls. Finally, he opened himself up and was willing to try \"new\" rolls. When I saw the rolls, I noticed Mi Ne's green dragon rolls were huge! Mi Ne used 1/4 of avocado as the decor for green dragon roll and they were generous on the quantity of avocado. I love how their rolls don't break apart when we pick them up, especially when the rolls are gigantic. The avocado melted inside my mouth! The shrimp tempura was quite crunchy too! Tastes so good!   2. (SM5) Orangeville Roll (9 Pieces) $16 - This spicy scallop roll was so delicious! The roll's portion was 1 salmon: 1 rice: 1 avocado, 1 cucumber and 3 spicy scallop and tobiko mixture. For some reason, I found their spicy scallop and tobiko mixture tasted like mentaiko! This is definitely a must-order roll at Mi Ne!  -- Overall --  I love their rolls even though their sushi rolls are quite pricey. For food, I would give them a 5 star. Less 1 star for the poor ventilation and less 1 star for the inattentive service. I would come back after they fix their air conditioner."}
{"text":"Quality wise this place is probably the best you'll get around this area. They are known for their rolls, which (unlike other places) can be a meal in itself. Sashimi portions are generous and fresh. Service is prompt because they have a buzzer at each table.  Value wise I find it pricer than average BUT if you're a party of two, you can maximize your value by going with the Love Boat or the other Boat (can't remember the name). Medium sashimi/sushi/roll tray is already 70 something before tax and tips. With the the Love boat you're looking at the same amount of food for 60 bucks before tax/tips and you WILL be full. Splurge a little by subbing the default roll with a special one on the menu for a small difference in price. However there is a sign posted outside that prices will hike mid-April, so please consider."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with the bf and disappointing from start to finish of the meal by the end of it got food poisoning and wanted to leave. Won't return ever again."}
{"text":"Their rolls were delicious, not too much rice covered and the moisture was perfect. The ingredients were fresh. One of the rolls we had called Orangeville which was pretty good, and we ordered a sushi boat that came with rolls and sashimi, tasted great too."}
{"text":"Have been seeing this place over the years, but never actually came. When my friend suggested we try it, I said why not!  Decided to go for the Tempura Udon and the Love Boat, and both were quite good. They seem to have a lot of udon options, so it was a wise choice to try one of them. The udon were very good and came in one of those hot rock pots. The Love Boat was huge and had lots of sushi/sashimi options. Very fresh and delicious with good variety to choose from.  The restaurant was a nice size, but maybe too large for the staff to handle. It took us a while to get seated after we arrived, even though there was a table available, and we had to ask for anything multiple times. This included asking to place our order, get tea, and our bill. With only 3 people serving on a Saturday night, it kinda makes sense they were so swamped and busy. They were still super nice and tried their best, despite forgetting some requests.   Not a bad selection for Japanese fold in the area, but probably not my top pick. Still worth checking out for their different unique udon options."}
{"text":"FOOD: delicious, great quality.  but average pricing.  Had the California spicy lunch with large and generous filling in their Maki, along with miso soup and salad.   Came for dinner and ordered two large combination platters and served 11 quite nicely. Not overly stuffed but content.   AMBIENCE: normal fare, nothing special. Saw some other table get some music and cake and a Polaroid picture with the table.   SERVICE: a little bit inattentive, but they did provide free miso soup and dessert (watermelon and taiyaki). The combination platters took about 30-40 minutes so be prepared for quite a long wait and order quickly.   PRICE: $312, tax included, to feed 12 mouths.  TIPS: Gets quite busy during lunch."}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout experience only.  The staff are great people- when you walk in the door, you get \"Hi!\" and \"Hello!\" from every angle. They are genuinely happy to see you, and very courteous. They even gave me free miso soup once, I'm assuming because I work in the same plaza.   The food is alright. A large menu to choose from, with lots of options to choose from. Likely a \"something for everyone\" type of menu. Huge portions that you can barely fit into your mouth. I've tried a few different rolls so far, namely the shrimp tempura (dynamite), spicy California roll, and the spider roll. None of them wowed me. I've found out that I do not like the softshell crab. The massive portions often go unfinished because it's too much. For more expensive sushi than what I'm used to paying, it's an unfortunate waste.   I do enjoy the beef gyoza dumplings. Probably the best I've ever had- crispy, juicy, and flavourful. This does not apply to the spicy gyoza- smothered in hot sauce, soggy, and much spicier than I was expecting. However, I realize how silly it is to complain about spicy food being spicy. I will not order the spicy gyoza again, simply because it is too much for me.   Even the tempura, which is a favourite of mine at my usual sushi watering hole, was not thrilling. Again, massive pieces, plenty to fill you. I normally enjoy lobster on any occasion, but lobster tempura was \"ok\" at best. Even the shrimp tempura tasted worlds different than where I normally eat.   I'm not saying their food is bad. Obviously many people think it's top notch, and it's packed in there at lunchtime. However, for me personally, the variance in flavours and taste between here and my usual spot are very different, and it makes it difficult for me to enjoy and appreciate the food to the fullest, when it doesn't meet your personal standard.   Nothing against Mi Ne, but it's just not for me. I'll probably pop in for an occasional order of beef gyoza, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Probably the best spicy tuna and spicy tuna rolls in the city. Not cheap, but is my favourite."}
{"text":"Very good rolls. You're paying around 13-18 dollars for different sets of rolls. These rolls contain roughly about 6-8 pieces. They don't use a lot of rice (which is good) so you can get most of the flavour from the other ingredients (which is the most expensive part).   FAVOURITE ROLL: caterpillar roll which main ingredient is avocado. They give generous amounts of avocado. On top of that, this roll practically melts in your mouth. Every ingredient within this roll seems to compliment each other and all my friends LOVE this one.   Their sashimi is fairly fresh, could be better. Interesting that their sea urchin (uni) sashimi comes with TWO dangerously large oysters which taste like fish x20282928. Sometimes their uni is good and it will taste blessed, sometimes it would taste like you just ate trash - literally.   Overall the service is good. I'm always being served by kind waitresses and they were trained very well.   I do recommend this place for it is best for their rolls."}
{"text":"Clean, tasty, good service Great value for money stress free parking will come back i recommend"}
{"text":"First time visit was with the family, lunch after Sunday church. Food was excellent, service was great. Second visit was with my wife, again..we enjoy the quality of food and amazing service. Can really recommend this place for friends and others. Price was also reasonable and acceptable. Keep the quality, service and pricing like this."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour with my cousin on a Saturday.  Happy hour is from 2:30 pm - 5 pm every day, Sashimi 10% off (Uni, Oyster), All other items 20% off, Additional 5% off if paid by cash, no take out order, no lunch menu.  This restaurant is operated by Koreans.  The tables have a button that plays a sound for the waiter/waitress to come to your table.    We ordered the Love Boat and Spider roll:  Love Boat ($60): 29 sushi & maki, 20 sashimi, 2 miso soups & 2 green salads.  It came with salmon, salmon belly, tuna, butterfish, tilapia, eel, shrimp, California roll, spicy salmon roll, dragon roll (half green, half red).  For $60, I thought it was extremely pricy and disappointed considering the fact that they did not give squid, scallop, uni, yellow tail or toro.  Soup and salad was pretty average.    Spider Roll $14: deep fried real soft shell crab, crab stick, tobiko, lettuce, bonito & cucumber.  Quantity greater than quality for this one.  After eating one piece, I didn't feel like eating a second one.    Even with their happy hour special, I don't think their Love Boat is worth order considering the price and the cuts of fish that come with it.     p.s. Free Wifi, password is the business number: 9054701688"}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi and great rolls selection. Ordered a combination platter, an Alaskan roll and a beef udon and salmon teriyaki. The Alaskan roll was delicious with salmon, scallops and avocado. The platter comes with a good selection of sashimi, some sushi and a spicy salmon roll and a red and a green dragon roll. The salmon teriyaki came on a hot plate and tasted like the usual. The udons were not that great. The usual udon plus a dry grilled piece of beef or chicken and didn't go well with the udon at all.   They offered a variety of fruit sorbets that came in an interesting bowl, like coconut sorbet would come in a coconut shell or pineapple sorbet will come in a pineapple shell. However out of the six different types they offered they only had one available, which I thought was kind of unacceptable. However, the service was excellent and there's plenty of parking available. They gave us pineapple slices at the end of the meal. Password enabled wifi is available."}
{"text":"Spacious restaurant with above average sushi/sashimi quality. Maki rolls are HUGE! Prices are average for sushi. Only issue was that service was a little slow in terms of trying to get a server to come to our table."}
{"text":"Love their rolls.  Service is average.  The place is small so feel very crowded."}
{"text":"If you're in Markham, there are more options for sushi than you can shake a stick at. I'm sure everyone has there fav, but as far as a widely accepted, great sushi is concerned, you'll want to make your way over to MINE Sushi, right around Woodbine and Highway 7.  Our group of four sauntered in for lunch without much of a clue what exactly we wanted to eat, so we nabbed ourselves one of their variety platters. The sizes vary from small (30 pieces), to extra large (81 pieces). We settled on a 43 piece medium, which comes with 22 pieces of sushi and 21 rolls.  I'm going to spare you a description of each kind of roll. Just know that in general, everything tasted fresh, and they had a good variety that didn't leave us wanting further options. Out of the four of us (all adults), we were able to finish the medium platter, though two in the group were full midway through the meal, and the other two had to push a slightly past comfortably satiated in order to finish.  I have certainly had more interesting sushi and rolls elsewhere, but as far as covering the basics goes, hats off to MINE Sushi."}
{"text":"Good value (cash discount). Really large rolls and great/creative presentation. A bit different and fun for groups."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday (Mother's Day) and was pretty disappointed. This is my third time at this location and the service is honestly questionable.   I understand that it's a busy place on a special occasions day but they have a bell on each table to call for service which ends up pretty much being a decoration. We had to wait maybe 15 minutes for a table which without reservations is actually decent. The table was \"cleaned\" for us but the couch I sat on was completely covered in tempura batter. We then had to wait like 20 minutes and 4 rings of the bell to have our order taken. Food came after about 15 minutes which was okay. But nobody stopped by for anything, whether it be napkins or refills of drinks and I couldn't be bothered to wait.  Had this been a one time thing I'd probably have let it go but I recall going in for a preordered take out order and still waiting for 40 minutes.   I love the food and while I normally prefer AYCE the food here is fresh, decently prized and comes in huge portions. If I was judging solely on food it'd easily be a 4-4.5/5 but unfortunately the service ruins the place and just like last time it'll probably be a while before I go again."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with MI-NE sushi, friendly service, fresh food, reasonably priced. I went for lunch and would like to try it for dinner one day soon. Completely recommend"}
{"text":"I never had this horrible sushi/sashimi in my whole life. I've ordered love boat sushi. The quality is awful- frozen sushi/sashimi  Price about $70 Service 2 out of 5  I wouldn't suggest this place to NO one. I cannot forget the texture of sushi/sashimi.. first time I left half of food!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty good early dinner here! I was in the area looking for a sushi place to eat and we happened upon this deserted plaza but it ended up being a nice and cozy restaurant. The decor was lovely and as we entered, we were greeted warmly.  The food was pretty good. My partner and I ordered 3 things: - Sushi and sashimi (A Zen Combination) - Chicken Katsu - 2 Spicy Salmon Rolls It was all pretty good, not amazing but pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times. As soon as you walk in, you can hear greetings and awaits for your seat very quickly.  All servers are always smiling and friendly.  Food size is just right and delicious. I love their IKURA sushi and uni, they are always fresh. The most impressive was their customer services.  We've got a wine glasses with some tiny things on it...so we asked the server to see it.   Our server politely apologises and  quickly response with a clean glasses.   You'll not miss their thank you, excuse me, enjoy your food and how is our food. They care their business and customer service is outstanding!! Will visit again"}
{"text":"I really like the wide assortment of selection here with a lot of seafood options including live oysters and live sea urchin. Their rolls and bento boxes are a little pricier than most other places but the portions are fairly large and very good quality of food. I really enjoyed their spicy salmon rolls and dynamite roll. I've also been here for dinner and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Maybe I am too much of a Sushi snob to appreciate this place but I really disliked their Sashimi and Rolls.  We came here because we were super hungry and ordered the Small Sashimi, Salmom Roll, Caterpillar Roll, and 2 seaweed salads.  The service and decor are all good so this review is just on the food itself.  First off we paid $17 for the Caterpillar roll which was massive just like all of their pieces but it definitely did not taste good.  It felt like am overstuffed burrito trying to me too much all at once.  The salmon roll was stuffed with massive pieces of salmon and did not taste natural whatsoever.  I literally have salmon roll EVERY SINGLE TIME I eat sushi so I would consider myself an expert at what a \"good\" salmom roll is and this one was not.  Usually sushi is meant to eat with one bite but I felt like I was eating a Salmon Sandwich when I ate these rolls...It just was not good at all.  Also the Sashimi was cut in a horrendous fashion with big pieces that were literally cut into squares.  But like I said... MAYBE its because I have  been to some pretty good sushi restaurants so my opinion and expectations from sushin are a bit higher.  They have 1001 items on their menu so if you are a fan of Options and Massive pieces of Sushi ... come here...."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Came in a fancy boat. I think its owned by koreans.. the waiters were all korean and even saw some korean customers. Service was good and fast. Didnt have to wait long. Price is average."}
{"text":"This MINE sushi is conveniently located close to me.  The sushi is fresh but it is also not the best I've had. The sashimi are usually in thick slices and the rolls are huge!   I usually enjoy the maki rolls more than any other items on their menu. Other than that, everything is good... nothing too wild. The pricing is quite decent for the large portions you receive and somehow I always leave with leftovers lol   Service is quick as they have the button on the side of the table. It seems like they are always busy during lunch, dinner and weekends so it's better to reserve a table for peak hours"}
{"text":"The Est Roll had 9 pieces of BBQ eel, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, and wrapped with salmon and tuna.  It was a beautifully coloured roll and like I noticed last time, Mi-Ne likes to include fruit into their sushi dishes.  The Est Roll combined slices of apples in its creation.  It was a big sushi since it contained so many ingredients.  It was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"A place for special occasions and a good place to bring your parents. The price is on the higher end but the food is decent and fresh, especially the sashimi. Th chefs are good with adding style to the plating and creativity to the presentation. For example, the soba noodles comes with a sauce that's presented in a bowl made out of ice to keep it cool (see attached picture).  I ordered the beef udon which is $15 for a large bowl (think of a large stone pot sized bibimbap but filled with udon noodles instead). It's one of the cheaper things on the menu but is still good for a portion of that size. It came with a small salad and miso soup as appetizers. They gave plenty of beef and some veggies in the soup. There was a large piece of Chinese broccoli and I wish they could cut it a bit so it's easier to eat the stick that's more than half the size of my face; hence the one star deduction.  Service is fast. They have a little service button at each table. The menus may seem a bit overwhelming for first timers but I just looked at the pictures on the walls and included in the menu to help me decide. If you are lost, go with the dinner specials. Each gives you a taste of everything (eg sashimi, udon, salad etc)  Call and reserve ahead of time. The place is packed during weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Sashimi is tasteless.  It didn't come with any salad, soup or ice cream which many japanese restaurants offer them as complimentary .  Not much service was provided.  The raw oyster which was part of the sashimi platter didn't has any sauce or a slice of lemon, which we found quite crude. Will not go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants. Food and price are decent and service is not bad. Highly recommend not to go there on Friday night as it is always busy. Overall experience at mini is so far on my top 5 list in the area for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Had the spicy salmon roll + assorted nigiri combo. I've seen lots of photos of this place and I've been wanting to try it for a while now!  Decor: 4/5 not much to say but it was pleasant to look at!  Food: 4.5/5 for the combo set I had, I really enjoyed the flavour of the spicy salmon roll! I also really liked the nigiri as well. I liked that there was an option to remove the wasabi from the sushi but I kept it there since it's more authentic that way and they seem to be pretty big on authenticity. I tried the spider roll as well and it wasn't bad. The salmon teriyaki bento box looked pretty good and had a good assortment of stuff. My mom, who ordered the bento box, said the salmon was over cooked however.   Service: 3.8/5 servers seem nice. I can't give it a 4 because I originally asked for wasabi separately from the fish but the server forgot. I was totally fine with it though but it wasn't too busy when we went so... I felt like she could've remembered it?   Price: 3/5 not too expensive but price was average.   Anyway I will definitely be back to try some more combo sets! :)"}
{"text":"Just came for dinner and I wasn't expecting portions to be so big. I have badminton after this and only needed a few pieces of sushi.. Turns out my gf had bigger eyes than her stomach LOL! I ordered a grilled beef udon and she ordered the unagi rice + lobster maki (I think? Look at pics). My udon and her rice was fantastic, but the sushi wasn't very fresh unfortunately. It was good until I realized something during badminton.. My throat was EXTRA dry tonight.. Backtracked and figured it must've been the soup in my udon.. MSG I presume, because the only other time I get this is when I have Pho or Pork Bone soup..  Food isn't as good as Osaka, on hwy 7 between mccowan and markham road. It's beside the shoppers.. I recommend that place more + pricing is reasonable there."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to trying new Japanese restaurants unless the reviews are at least above average. We were super hungry and decided to give this place a try because it was close by. We got here just before 6pm so we beat the dinner rush and was immediately seated.  The restaurant seemed really nice but wasn't sure if it was more focused on the the ambience or just having too many options on the menu. I was amazed with the amount of food items that they had ranging from izakaya, sushi items, korean dishes and specializing in udon. Usually when there are too many things going on, it's hard to focus on making the common items good.   Okay so after scanning the menu for like 3 minutes, we decided to order our usual: sashimi platter, caterpillar roll, seaweed salad and miso soup. I was craving eel so I figured the caterpillar roll would be good for the price it was..$17. But after taking the first bite, it was probably the worst roll i've had! There was barely any unagi, I mean this is usually why the roll is more expensive and the roll was just too big so it was falling apart. Now onto the sashimi platter $44 for like small platter of 40 but it seemed more like 60pcs because they were cut so big and thick...however the worst part was the way it was cut..im used to sashimi being cut in nice thin slices. There's a certain technique that a good sushi chef uses when it comes to slicing the fish. The sashimi here were cut into like squares...it just makes the texture different and unusual to eat. The sashimi also wasn't as fresh either. So for the price we paid almost at $100 it was totally not worth it and this rating is solely based on the food because the service was decent."}
{"text":"First review of this place. Came for friends bday dinner. Three of us split a couple of rolls between us (i think 3 or 4?) while the others got hot entrees and one guy got the cold soba noodles which actually looked quite tasty.  I must say the hot entrees came in big portions which was a very pleasant surprise as japanese restaurants tend to give really small portions for hot entree dishes. The rolls we got were generously sized as well and didnt skimp out on ingredients.  Waitresses were attentive and friendly. It was pricey though which might be the only reason I gave 4 stars (after splitting bill, mine came to around $30 including tax and tip)  Overall, awesome experience, will return with my family perhaps."}
{"text":"The rolls are great because it's huge and creative. The bent boxes are on the pricy side for what you get. I've tasted better. But I would definitely come back for the roll only though."}
{"text":"Mi Ne makes a good effort, but falls short in some areas. The staff are friendly and attentive and exhibit a true desire to provide an enjoyable dining experience.    Where I get lost is in some of the food innovations.  I ordered the spicy Gyoza to start.  It was smothered in hot sauce which just overtook the dish and turned the dumplings into soggy mush.  Then I ordered the spicy tuna tempura roll.  I wasn't expecting that the pieces were covered in tempura and then deep fried.  This mostly cooked the tuna and ruined otherwise good raw fish.  It also turned the rice into mush, making the dish a bit a failed mess.  Looked good though, see the pic."}
{"text":"3 out of 5 stars  The seaweed salad was the one dish that stood out for us.  Not the green dragon roll nor the lobster/shrimp tempura nor the Sushi pizza.  The green dragon roll was so-so for us since we've been spoiled by VIPS' green dragon roll which is so much better!  The lobster tempura was new to us so we were excited to try it.  It was a bit of a let-down though.  The Sushi pizza was okay.  The teriyaki chicken had lots of veggies so we enjoyed it more.  Overall, it was an average experience.  However, for the price, I would rather go to an AYCE Japanese restaurant than here."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy seafood lunch special.  Includes miso soup and house salad.  Lunch special has plenty of spicy seafood including three giant pieces of shrimp, a couple of scallops, imitation crab meat, and a nice chunk of salmon with a side of rice and some tempura, all for just 12 dollars and it was all Mi-NE.  Definitely worth it.  Also, the miso soup wasn't too salty, which is a definite plus because I find miso soups quite salty these days."}
{"text":"This place is one of my go to places for yummy Japanese food. Good ambiance and very busy. However we were seated quickly. So we ordered food, and that came out in decent time despite the ordered chaos happening at the restaurant. So I ordered beef teriyaki dinner and it came out a bit over cooked. I mean, I was expecting a bit more pink. Not too hard to cook a piece of steak correctly. Anyhow, I also ordered the Orangeville Roll and that was quite very awesome."}
{"text":"I always come to MINE as they are one of the better sushi places around the area. Service is good, and during lunch hours there are discounts as well, but I normally come for dinner lol  Rolls  I've tried a few rolls but nothing other than their Orangeville roll and torches rainbow dragon roll stand out.  Orangeville roll - spicy scallop with cucumber and avocado and tobiko topped with salmon and spicy sauce. Flavourful and a tiny kick from their siracha mayo, but to be honest I wouldn't be able to tell if it's scallop or salmon inside lol Torched rainbow dynamite roll - this is your typical dynamite roll with shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber alongside a bed of fresh sashimi on top of the roll and torched. This roll I find is also flavourful and the smokiness from the torch gives it a distinctive flavour.   Needless to say I have tried their other special rolls and the rest weren't anything special.   Other worthy mentions- grilled hamachi, sushi pizza, mushroom soup"}
{"text":"I think my reaction to the food when it first came to our table can best be summarized by an emoji: :0  I really should've taken the previous reviews more seriously when they said the portions are huge. They weren't kidding! My boyfriend ordered the lobster tempura set (after mulling for 10 minutes over the $30 price tag before committing). It sailed to our table in the form of a wooden sushi boat with towering pieces of lobster tempura and a side of chicken katsu. This was supposed to be dinner for one person??    At $20, my Chirashi was no joke either. Rather than a normal sized bowl, it came in a large white plate that was almost the length of my chopsticks. To describe the sashimi as \"sliced\" was misleading on the menu. These were thick chunks of fish! The salmon and tuna were similar to the size of an ice cube.  The variety of sashimi wasn't amazing as the selections weren't that unique. I also wish they could've seasoned the rice though because it was just plain sushi rice.   If I were to go on food alone, I would give Mi Ne about a 3. It's very average. However, the portions and the service is bumping this review up to a 4. We were given a booth very close to the door. This is the first restaurant I've been to where they actually put up a portable partisan right next to us so we wouldn't have to exchange awkward stares with incoming/outgoing customers. They also checked up on us regularly, not something you experience in a lot of Markham restaurants.   Was this the best sushi I've ever had? No, far from it. But it's a place that I will return to because of the quantity and the service. For my boyfriend, this is his dream come true: a sushi place that can finally fill him up without bankrupting him.  (23/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favourite Japanese restaurant.  Being a pescatarian, I find that I tend to eat a LOT of sushi because of my dietary restrictions.  So, I have tried quite a few places and this is my favourite by far.    I always start off my meal with the Avocado Crab Salad.  It sounds like a simple dish, but the combination of tempura bits, Japanese salad dressing, avocado, crab meat and fish roe is divine.    Then I choose between two different rolls.  The Torched Rainbow Roll and the Orangeville Roll.  Try both if you can.  Whenever I get take-out from MINE, I always get their Sushi Appetizer Combo.  With even simple Salmon Sushi, MINE is the best.  The salmon is flavourful and portioned largely.  The only problem with MINE is that it is a bit pricier."}
{"text":"It's always busy! How can you say no to sushi? They also have interesting soup and noodles if sushi isn't your thing.  However, I'm finding that it's lost a bit of the quality from the previous times I've gone there. Their lunch/afternoon menu is pretty decently priced and tasty. Their staff are friendly and the women are dressed in traditional attire. They also have a nice desert menu. Overall a good restaurant for family and just going out to eat. Their booths divide up the space to make a somewhat more private experience which is nice."}
{"text":"I am writing this review since it is my easy nearby sushi restaurant and decent environment to have a good torched dragon roll.  My favourite dish to order from here is the dragon roll. I've been here plenty of times. This place is not that busy during off hours but when it is lunch time during weekday, I think it is a restaurant that attracts alot of customers that work nearby and can get a good deal for their sushi lunch set combo. Very filling for their Benton sushi box with a decent price.   Do not need to order their boat if you are interested in uni.... Because it did not taste fresh in any way.   But I love to go back here for the one thing i love ordering- torched dragon roll or lunch time sushi set !!  I do recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating sushi at Mi-Ne franchises and for the York Region area, I'd say it's the best I've had. They have a vast variety of delicious maki rolls. The rolls are large and filled with a lot of ingredients and minimal rice.  Lunch specials are awesome & well priced and as for dinner, I always order the love boat for two. It's intended for two but it's a lot of food! FYI, you can ask to opt out certain sashimi or sushi if you do not like the type of fish. For example: I always ask for all salmon sashimi but assorted sushi! They're always accommodating.   I was surprised to find that they have a happy hour special this week. 3:00PM-5:00PM * 20% off sashimi items (love boat included) and 30% off all other items including beverages. Amazing!   This location is much bigger than the Yonge & Elgin Mills location with a lot more seating. However, I do believe the prices may be a little higher."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but I rounded up because I came in at a pretty good time.   Came here for an early dinner and made it just in time for the 2:30 - 5:00pm special. All sashimi orders (even if it has a bit of sashimi in it is 10% off), and everything else is 20% off. In addition, if you pay by cash it's 5% off now, not 10% off, but still a great deal! The environment was beautiful, with many cubicles for guests to enjoy a bit of privacy instead of sitting close to people they don't know while they eat. I didn't really check what our meals were included with, but we got one miso soup and two complementary salads.  I think we were rushing to make it in time for the 5:00pm special and rushed our order. Initially, I wanted sushi, but ordered the Chief Special DInner Set #2, which is for people who is a fan of cooked food as it includes a teriyaki salmon head, spicy japchae noodles with chicken, broccoli and mushrooms, 5 pieces of raw salmon (two of which include salmon skin) with a clump of rice and lobster, onion and shrimp terriyaki (3 pieces). This was $28, and because there was raw salmon, it was 10% off. This portion was MASSIVE. I thought the food itself was average, not superb, but not terrible either. The portion and the amount I was paying for it was worth it.   The other dish we got was the soft shelled crab udon for $18. THERE WERE TWO soft shelled crabs in this udon. Holy moly, usually, one soft shelled crabs usually cost close to $8 at the places I get them at. I didn't really like it dunked inside my soup, I suggest it served on a separate plate. These crabs were BIG, literally they were bigger than my hand each. I literally tasted the cholesterol part of it and was pretty full after eating one of it. The udon was okay.   When we got our bill, the waiter was really nice and gave us two large pieces of mint gum as well!  Going to come back to try out their sushi - hopefully catching this time again for their special."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Markham hands down. I would prefer this over all you can eat. Their rolls are especially good, like the golden dragon roll, EST roll. Sashimi is fresh, cut in thick slices. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Value-for-money (VFM) meal from this place would be their Izakaya combos. For $12, you get a drink (either beer or mojito), and a snack. We got the jalapeño salmon bomb which was crunchy and really spicy.   Another VFM option would be their gigantic rolls, for about $15-$18/each. We tried their Orangeville roll (incl. scallops, salmon, avocado, crab roes) which we liked because of how fresh all the ingredients were and the variety of textures, though we couldn't really taste the scallops.   Remember to bring cash because you get 10% off during dinner, or 5% off during happy hours until 5:00pm."}
{"text":"Not an AYCE place but the rolls are filling and the sashimi was fresh. Orangeville rolls were my favourite!"}
{"text":"Today the service was excruciatingly slow!  We usually come and the tea and miso soup comes almost right after we order.  This is usually during busy Friday lunch times when all the business people go for lunch.  This was a Saturday around 1:00pm so the busiest time was done and the restaurant was at about 60% capacity.  I finally asked a server after waiting for 10 mins and still nothing on the table. It finally came 5 mins later.  Our food took even longer.  We waited 20+ mins and the food came out on a trolley with our box on the bottom shelf!  This was pretty gross to me as I saw it sitting there with people around it and it being only inches from the floor!  The food looked like it had been sitting somewhere for quite some time as the sauce on the rolls had that dull already-soaked-in look.  Nonetheless the food still tasted good but we did not appreciate the super long wait when the restaurant wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was really stuck between 4 and 5 stars because of the sushi but it was amazing.   Staff were attentive and the sushi pieces were ginormous. We ordered 3 rolls. These pieces were gigantic.   So the reason I put it as a 4 is because the pieces were so big that they fell apart and no amount of dexterity with the chopsticks could keep them intact.   However, I gotta say that I really appreciate the topping to rice ratio. I love that they didn't skimp. We had 3 whole rolls (Orangeville, SSC, and torched dragon roll, which was the only non-spicy roll). The plating was appealing and the flavours were fresh.   I'd definitely recommend this place. I want to live here."}
{"text":"Mi Ne sushi has been my go to spot for years! I knew the owner when he started the first one in Richmond Hill. The rolls are delicious and the fish is fresh. Order the Orangeville roll! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"If you read people's Facebook plaudits for this place, you'd think it's all that and more.   Unfortunately, except for the cozy interior, and friendly service there isn't much to be excited about - the food is ok to mediocre (this only applies to rolls, sushi and sashimi - haven't tried any of their hot food).   Combined with the price, the value for money wasn't there.   Won't repeat."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing, especially with all the positive reviews.  Husband and I came here on a Saturday night, and with the crowd huddling around outside near the front entrance, we were excited to dine! Plus our tummies were growling at us, exclaiming, \"FEED ME! FEED ME!\"  Surprisingly, the wait wasn't very long. In total, we waited about 15 minutes. They gave us a handy pager.  Glancing the menu, we remarked at how expansive it was and how many offerings there were. Normally when we come across restaurants that offer such a variety, we are little more cautious in the food quality and preparation, but given all the great reviews, we didn't think this would be an issue.  So here are where things went wrong:  1. We saw our table being bused, and the waitress who was clearing it off used the same rag that had been in a used bin off near the hostess stand. Mind you, it was in clear view sight from all customers and us (waiting at the time). Cringe-worthy I tell you.  2. Barley tea was complimentary and a nice gesture, but not even seeped properly or hot. We requested another pot, and the it was the same result.  3. When we inquired about ordering a tekka maki (which is tuna roll), the waiter didn't know what we were referring to. We saw on their menu that they had tuna with cucumber, and tuna with avocado. We just wanted a simple tuna roll, and this was the first place that we've encountered that not only didn't offer it, but didn't know what it was. Yikes.  4. Gyoza that we ordered was beef, and the wrapper was off in thickness, and there was this overwhelming sweet sauce doused all over it on the skillet. It had an off-putting after taste, so combined with that and the texture of the wrapper, the dish was not appetizing.  5. Our salads and soups were not bad. Refreshing for the salad, and good dressing. Soup was hot, but not enough texture with wakame, tofu, or even mushrooms.  6. Tempura udon that we ordered was served in the korean stone pot, and lots and lots of veggies. Yummy variety, but the soup base was lukewarm and one note - TOO SWEET. Once again, the peeled carrot on the gyoza appeared in the soup as well. On the positive side, the tempura was good - batter light and flaky, good variety, sweet and moist shrimp.  7. Sashimi dinner was not very good either. The cuts of fish were not properly cut, and even some of the fish choices looked past their due date, so a good portion of the plate we weren't able to eat. Salmon pieces were not flavorful, and the one we look forward to most, TUNA, had not an ounce of tuna flavor! The only piece that was delicious was the smoked whitefish, octopus, and yellowtail. At $31 CAD, we would want to have the utmost freshness in our sashimi. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Staff was pleasant, but nothing out of this world. Perhaps their udon and sashimi aren't their strong points, and we might have had a better experience had we ordered their rolls, but I'm not so sure we'd take a gamble to find that out. Onto the next sushi adventure!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is very tasty. They're creative with their rolls, and there's a variety on the menu. I've been here 3 times and I'm always happy with the food.   Service was slow - we were sat down, given tea, and then left waiting for 15 minutes. My friends and I were pretty busy chatting but finally enough was enough. Fortunately to other Yelp reviewers, I knew there was a little button to push for service. Weird though, we pushed it and a lady came by and said \"just a minute\". Why come, just to make us wait some more?  Food: We go the Orangeville, the Kamikaze Maki, and Spicy Tuna. In retrospect these were all very similar, lol. But very tasty. 3 rolls for the 3 of us and we were stuffed. Although, we did have some tempura and soup beforehand.   Dessert: Mochi ice cream and mango pudding. I was really happy to see mochi on the menu as I'm having a hard time finding it! It was okay here. The flour layer was a bit too thick.   I know I can always rely on good quality (but non-AYCE) sushi so I don't mind when my friends suggest it. However, it is a bit of a distance for me so I never go there myself."}
{"text":"Although this place was in a deserted plaza, this place was poppin! I believe this is one of the newer places that opened up since nothing looked worn down, and there was even a 'call' button for service.  Complementary Miso Soup & Salad - The miso soup has enoki mushrooms and isn't diluted! The salad isn't watery (which happens to be the case everywhere else) and even the taste of the vinegar is superb for a free appetizer.  Sushi Pizza ~$9 I've never had such a LEGIT sushi pizza before. The other times at AYCE places, the pizza is really floury with rice on the inside, with a dash of whichever toppings you ask for. However this one mainly focused on the flavours on top instead of the rice on the middle which was amazing! The chewiness and textures of the crushed crab meat, fish roe, cucumbers, and salmon (a fatty part of the salmon might I add) went really well, and it helps that the ingredients were fresh! It's served with spicy mayo on the side.  Dinner Special Set #2 ~$28 This is meant for one person but it's a huge portion. 4 dishes included from most to least favourite:  Chicken Dak Galbi and glass noodles in spicy soup - maybe it's because it was a cold day, but this stayed hot throughout the entire meal. Salmon sashimi with rice- 2 pieces had a layer of fat over the top which was so falserkjser good! 3 pcs Tempura (Lobster, Shrimp, Squash) - The lobster one was really cool. The breading was similar to popeye's fried shrimp so if you like light and crispy tempura, this is for you! Teriyaki Salmon head with cabbage and carrot - There was a lot of bones on this but the meat was well cooked.  Complementary watermelon is included with your meal.  If you come here during \"happy hour\" 2:30-5:30 there is a 20% discount for food items. If you pay by cash there is a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch on some positive recommendations. I had the sashimi lunch special. All the fish was fresh and very generous in proportions. Also had an order of gyoza as a side dish. Meal came with a bowl of miso soup, rice, a couple of small 'rolls' and green tea.   All in all excellent and a bargain for the price. Establishment clean, service friendly. Located in a strip mall so lots of parking."}
{"text":"Nice place for sushi in Markham. A bit pricey but lots of good sushi places are these days. First time trying it on a weekday lunch.   The dining atmosphere was nice but also busy and loud. It was the middle of a packed lunch rush, but there were a few tables available when my friend and I walked in. We were seated promptly at a corner table, which was both cozy but also right by the doorway. This became an issue only when other diners left and we could feel the closing door's vibrations against our table. It wasn't too bothersome though.   Service was pretty good. Servers were polite and efficient. They did forget my request for an iced water without lemon but quickly corrected it. There were call buttons to request service at each table, which was a nice touch.   The food was really good. My friend and I both ordered sashimi lunch combos, which each came with a side of miso soup and starter salad. I had the Salmon Lover Sashimi Combo ($19) and my friend got the Assorted Sashimi Combo ($17). Each lunch combo came with 9 pieces of raw sashimi, glass noodles, and 2 sushi rolls (3-4 pieces). My dish also came with salmon teriyaki while my friends had a single portion of white rice. I found the sashimi to be very fresh and tasty, however my friend found the sashimi on his plate to be lacking in flavour. After trying some of my salmon sushi, he concluded that the sashimi on his plate and my plate were from two different cuts, with mine being the fresher batch. Other than the freshness of the sashimi, we found the rest of the items in our combos to be delicious.   Overall, a nice place for sushi, albeit a bit pricey. They offer a lot of variety in their menu, with numerous lunch combo options, udon soups, Sushi rolls and even oysters. Will be back to try their sushi rolls and udon soups next!"}
{"text":"First time customer.  Bento Box Lunch - Beef Ribs was very good.  The cabbage salad was a little oily but okay.  Some sushi would have made this lunch option seem reasonably priced.  It was a bit pricey.  Service was pretty good."}
{"text":"If you want big portion Japanese sushi or dish, this is the place to go in Markham.  Their price is a little high, but once you see how big their portions are, you won't feel it as expensive anymore.  Their sushi rolls are huge!  My mouth is relatively big already and I am having a hard time putting one roll sushi in my mouth!  Despite their large size, they do taste pretty good.  I especially love their spicy salmon roll, very well made!  Their regular sushi is decent as well, they are fairly fresh and they don't over stuff it with rice.  I also tried their Chirashi, which is also huge and they give you tons of rice and sashimi!  Overall, I am pretty happy with their food, the only negative comment I have is I find some of their dishes' portions are way too big and I think this is not how Japanese food should be.  One more comment, last time I ordered a roll with shrimp tempura in the middle (forgot which one I ordered), I noticed the shrimp tempura was not fried fresh, as a result, the roll wasn't as crispy and tasty,"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm never disappointed when I come here. Their prices for sushi are the same as every where else but their food portions are more and tastier. Their maki rolls are huge and filled with a lot of ingredients, especially their dynamite and spicy salmon rolls. Their seafood yaki udon is one of my favourite as it includes two large lobster tempuras and plenty of other seafood; not to mention, udon that is chewy and has a nice buttery taste. They have an amazing menu to choose from, and they are always having different menu specials. It's also great that if you pay cash, you get 10% off."}
{"text":"Very good food, great and fast service! I really like specials this particular Mi Ne offers, compared to other locations.  My udon dream came true here, Unagi Udon! Comes with the extra lobster tail tempura, very very tasty! It's clean, busy (which is great), food is fresh and high quality. This is definitely our fav spot for sushi up north"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food is fresh and tasty. Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The sushi was much better than I thought and it tasted great. In terms of the \"freshness\", it was slightly above average for the Markham area. The tempura shrimp was very nicely fried with the right amount of batter, and the shrimp had a good amount of meat on it. Their prices are quite high, but they do not hold back on the variety of ingredients they put into their Udon bowls. Reservations are recommended and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"As everyone seems to mention already the lunch 'special' menu is 4 pages; way too big in my opinion. And for being special I didn't feel the items were too special. Usually you get lunch (read cheaper) prices, but you won't get out of here under $14pp.  The portions are a decent size, perhaps appropriate for the prices but they are a bit big for lunch. I think they should shrink the portions and prices to be better value. If you come here you may want to consider if sharing is possible.  The food itself I didn't feel particularly interesting. If I see people say lower prices I might come back otherwise there is too much competition."}
{"text":"Have been recommended by a friend to come here a few years back. Once you tried Mi-ne, you cannot go back to regular sushi restaurants! I absolutely love their Orangeville roll. Pretty much everything I tried at this place was good though. The rolls are huge so don't order too much. We made the mistake of ordering three rolls plus a dinner set for two people last time, and oh boy... Let's just say we could not finish the food."}
{"text":"3.5 star rounded up to 4**  came here with a group of 9, we were seated promptly and the seats were comfortable. LLBO in effect here...   There were many choices on the menu and I had such a difficult time deciding...  Sashimi were mostly fresh except for the butter fish. I found it a little fishy smell so that was probably my only issue.   Sushi was all wrapped nice, all rice tucked in perfectly with nice cut...  We ordered 2*Love boat, fried tempura, udon...all of the items came out in a timely frame.. fried tempura was right amount of batter...not too much.. just right...   Udon was perfectly cooked... not over cooked... this place is in line with dt Mi -Ne and Aurora Mi NE...   Specialty rolls are yummy delicious....   All in all, this is somewhere I would want to come back. Prices are a little pricey but you do get quality..."}
{"text":"My family and I often come here for a decent a la carte sushi place. Their Love Boat menu items are quite filling and the sushi variety offered is quite diverse. I would definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"This is my third time going to Mi-Ne and it was another enjoyable experience.  It was a busy night and it took a while for our order to come. Within 10 mins of ordering, a waiter came by with free miso soup for our table as they knew the wait time might be longer than usual. Our table ordered the 81 extra large sushi platter for 4 people and there were about 10-12pcs left over at the end of the night.   The maki especially were very filling and the nigiri were fresh. Each piece was larger than average and the presentation with the board was nicely placed. What is unique about this restaurant is the chefs are very generous with the filling and it really takes 2 bites to finish a piece! The best among our platter were the softshell crab and spicy scallop. The softshell crab was huge and the scallop mixture was tasty.   I highly recommend getting this platter for 4+ people and praise Mi-Ne for their consistency in bringing tasty sushi to the table!"}
{"text":"MiNe pronounced (me-neh) is actually one of my favorite yet most expensive sushi places in Markham Richmond Hill area.   Their sushi is definitely off the charts. The sushi rice usually from other places is really thick, but this restaurant makes it a point to have less sushi rice with more stuffing inside, which makes it more valuable.   Their sashimi is fresh and melt in your mouth.  I can't speak enough about their amazing service as I've been here more than 3 times now and it has never disappointed me.  There are those bells at the side of your table to get the waitress attention but they are so friendly and timing of them coming to your table is so quick and efficient.  Birthday surprises were awesome as I was here to celebrate my mom's birthday. They would give out a huge slice of New York cheesecake."}
{"text":"Sushi dish size decent and rice is smaller sized which is good. Not fishy like some places. Veg tempura had good assortment of nicer veg like onion, broccoli, carrot, not just sweet potato.  2nd time, don't order beef teriyaki, super small portion, meat tough, not worth it."}
{"text":"Before I begin my review, it must be made known that I am no fan of seafood. With that stated, let's begin.  Something I liked about the restaurant was the privacy of each booth. There were small separations between guests which is great for avoiding awkward eye contact with strangers. There is also a button you can press to signal the staff that service is required; this is good. The staff did not come around too often but tea was replenished when needed.  The food was prepared in a timely manner. We ordered sushi, udon and a bento box. I cannot speak for the fishy meals but I enjoyed my bento box which included tender gyuu (beef) in a stone bowl. The portions are filling and most dishes are served with miso soup and salad.  Final thoughts: Pricing was good for the amount served. Pleasant atmosphere and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"So I'm going to be fair, but it was not what people said it was. We came with a group of 5 on a busy Tues night. We ordered a 2 person meal which included Mushroom soup, seaweed salad, shrimp/lobster/yam tempura, a mix of rolls and sushi and beef teriyaki. We also ordered a grilled yellow tail and Spiderroll. First, the mushroom soup was very tasty and aromatic. Then, the yellow tail came on an iron plate. We started poking at it and realized there was plastic wrap around the top piece. We told the server and they took it away. We started to do the math and asked why would a piece of grilled fish still have the plastic on. We came to the logical conclusion that the fish must have been pregrilled, then put away to be microwaved before serving. Which didn't sit right with us. Then the sushi and rolls arrived. Sushi looked bright and fresh but the salmon on the rolls were either cut too thin or not fresh as they didn't look right. The Spider roll was wayyyyy over bartered, fried and sweet. You could not taste soft shell crap because the msg powder was poured on. In response to our displeasure, the server brought a grilled salmon on the house which we definitely appreciated. However, to our suspicions the salmon was dry from microwaving and smothered in the same teriyaki sauce they put on everything. Our last dish was the beef teriyaki which was mediocre as best. Again, smothered in the same sweet teriyaki sauce as the fish. I cannot return to this location if this is what is expected at the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Pricey sushi. We usually order a boat to share amongst us, which gives a good variety.  Service is good.  Ample parking available.  Easy to find when driving by."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for my friend's bday! Great service and excellent food! Gave us free soup for my friend's child. :) Definitely will become one of our regular place to drop by for food :)"}
{"text":"MiNe is more on the expensive side, but you're getting some quality sushi here if that's something important to you. The fish is a great quality and always cold. You won't find luke warm sushi/ sashimi pieces here! I love that the sushi rolls are a nice balance between the rice and ingredients, because you really don't want to fill up on mouthfuls of rice only.   The portions are great and I think each dish is pretty well worth it's value. They have a nice variety to choose from and everything tasted so good!   We took my family here to celebrate a birthday and they were so kind to offer a cake and discount for the meal. The staff were so kind all throughout the meal. They were quick and efficient and always smiling. It made for a very enjoyable happy meal and we were definitely leaving with full, satisfied bellies!"}
{"text":"Had a sushi boat between 4 of us. The rice was really sweet, not enjoyable. I've had take out from here before and it wasn't so bad but this time was disappointing.   My friend had an udon which was served in a stone bowl. The kind you get with Korean soon tofu or bimbambap and I think it was quite unnecessary. The dumplings became soggy and the soup was too hot to save anything before they were over cooked. The broth and overall flavour was good though!  I'd give a 2.5 if I could because they aren't usually this bad. Again rice was too sweet."}
{"text":"Loved the rolls at Mi-Ne! I ordered three rolls and my favourite was the dynamite roll topped with salmon and scallop. All the ingredients were fresh, but the rice was on the mushy side and their prices are quite steep for rolls (16-17$).   The servers come by when you ring the bell at your table. The restaurant itself has Japanese wood decor, but the booth seats were a bit run down and ripping. Overall a good sushi restaurant - I'd probably only come here for rolls and not nigiri though."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience for lunch at this restaurant.  The fish is fresh and the service was good.  I like the a la carte menu and the deco of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant was recommended to me by a friend, I was a little skeptical at first as I always am but this is a hidden gem in the GTA! Mi-Ne Sushi is located on Woodbine Ave, in between 16th and Hwy 7. If you're coming from 16th going south, take a left at the second light and immediately on your left in that plaza is where Mi-Ne Sushi is!  There's a bunch of parking but it usually fills up quite quick. Mi-Ne is in the corner of the plaza. Upon going in... first impressions, the girl was really nice and greeted us with a smile on her face (even though there were rain clouds and it was getting gloomy), the décor was nice! I love how they've designed the place. Lots of lighting, decorations and whatnot.  There's so much to choose from and their menus are really classy looking (if you want to call it that, I guess fancy is a better word). Ended up getting 3 lunch specials with a couple of friends and tried it out. Wow, first off - the salad was amazing. The sushi was perfect. Not too much rice, tightly tucked in and super fresh. Oh my. I felt like I died and went to heaven.  At first since I'm usually more into AYCE sushi places, I figured maybe this isn't such a good idea. Oh, it was. It really was. I don't give 5 stars often, but this was worth it! Amazing service, amazing food! Beyond expectations!  I assume that other customers agree with me, as this place was pretty much full of customers when we went there. Also, I think they're actually Japanese, not like the Cantonese AYCE sushi places. Not that either is a bad thing, just the friend that recommended it said it was more \"authentic\".  Earned a 5/5 with me. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour 2:30-5:00 - 20% off, 10% off sashimi, extra 5% off if paid by cash.   First impression: banquette seats are dirty, so I felt uncomfortable. I liked the rolls better than the nigiri and sashimi.   Maki Set I - 6 each: Spicy scallop, spicy salmon and California roll. Huge rolls. Comes with miso soup (a tad salty) and salad.   Tempura - not bad, hot and crispy, but the broccoli one was soggy.  Hamachi sashimi had a yellow-ish tint - not sure about that. Squid sashimi was good.   Also ordered a nigiri sushi set with a variety of salmon, tuna, eel, shrimp, herring roe, squid, hamachi. The sushi on the chubbier side."}
{"text":"I am kind of like this place. Everytime when I want to have the Japanese food, I always think about MINE."}
{"text":"This was my third time coming to Mi Ne. Came on a Saturday night without a reservation. Waited about half an hour for a table for two. The place is quite large but does get pretty busy, especially on weekends.  Ordered the Love Boat! It comes with 2 soups and 2 salads, an assortment of sushi, sashimi and rolls for ~$70. The fish here is nice and fresh. Salmon was fatty. And the rolls are huge. I think Mi Ne has one of the best Spicy Salmon Rolls. Took a box of leftovers home for later consumption.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Yes, Mi-Ne is a bit pricey, but I really like it.  Since their first store in Aurora, I got in love with them.  Usually we order Sushi x Sashimi Platter, and some signature rolls (Tuna Lover roll, Rainbow Dragon roll, Spider roll, etc).  Or a love boat for two!!  I really love their Signature Rolls~ and I usually \"study\" that menu first.  Services are nice and quick.  Like many Korean restaurants, they have a call bell on each table. Their food is good, with fresh sashimi.  They have other dishes for my friends who can't have raw fish, too.  It's a good place for gathering meal with friends and family.  Tried their Happy Hour during weekdays, and it is a very good deal :-D"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI PLACE IN TOWN!  Been here a few times with family and friends. Food and service are consistent every visit.  The rolls are especially nice, big portion filled with fresh ingredients. Tempura are nicely made as well, fresh batter and fluffy every time.  Seafood undo was great too, with lobster tail, shrimp, scallop, mussels.  Sashimi boat was definitely a hit for me, besides the usual tuna and salmon, they tend to have different types of fish each time we visited.   p.s. If you pay with cash, there's also a 10% discount!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mi Ne at least a handful of occasions for their sushi, as well as their take out. My brother first introduced this franchaise to me two years ago because I was first familiar with the location on Bremner Blvd next to Skydome/Rogers Centre. Ever since I went there for the food, I kept thinking about it, until I found out that they opened a location up in Markham at woodbine/highway 7 area! Though neither locations are super close to me, the uptown is still a bit closer.   Anyway, first time I went with my family, and subsequently when my relatives visit Toronto, my family and I usually end up taking them here. Why? for a few reasons listed below:  1. their rolls. Okay, this is by far THE BEST restaurant to go to if you are a fan of maki/specialty rolls. Seriously. they have a million combinations, and EVERY single one is GOOD. To date I don't think I've tried any of them that were \"bad\". I love how their rice ratio is on the lower side, so less rice, and lots of ingredients. plus they are HUGE! the flavours all combined, seriously, can't stop thinking about them.  Anyway here are the rolls that I really like: - #1 Lobster roll: i love this roll, esp for those who really like lobster! The only thing I would say is that if the lobster wasn't deep fried I would enjoy it even more! But then I just try to think of it as equivalent of a dynamite roll... except i'ts lobster and not shrimp :)  -#5 Orangeville roll: every time I come here, i always get it. just read the ingredients. Spicy scallop roll, warpped with fresh salmon, tobiko & avocado. Can't go wrong, seriously. MUST try esp for those who love scallop! - #30 Tuna lover roll: Another staple that i always get, because i LOVE Tuna, even more than salmon i must say, so for those who love the red tuna, this one is for you. Fresh spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, tobiko wrapped with fresh tuna - #32 Torch Rainbow roll: Rainbow dragon roll with torch and spicy sauce. A bit of a twist from your usual rainbow roll, but who doens't like a blow-torched roll?? - #35 Twist roll: Another one of my favourites. Deep fried real soft shell crab, crab stick, cucumber, tobiko, lettuce, bonito wrapped with salmon and tuna. This is basically like a soft shell crab roll, except, they elevated it to the next level by adding all those other ingredients to it. Everything together is just... amazing.  Aside from that, I've tried their platters too - combo ones with sushi and sashimi. I really like them. They have a huge variety of sashimi (not just your typical fish per say). And the portions are nice, not super large, but enough, and most importantly, i'ts fresh. I've bought take out platters before and my friends all commented that the quality is very good esp for a party platter. The prices are not super cheap, but really with Japanese food, you get what you pay for. I love at the restaurant they always serve eveyrthing togehter on a LARGE boat. Space wise it's a bit crammed, but the presentation always looks beautiful.  Would definitely come back as a regular whenever I need some GOOD japanese foods :) They also give 10% discount if you pay with cash, which is always a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"This review is for a lunch experience.  We ordered from the lunch special menu that lasts for 4 pages.  We found the sushi relatively fresh.  The maki rolls were big and had little rice.  The tempura and the teriyaki food were tasty and generous in portion.  We were surprised that the sushi special ($11) came with tuna.  The Kalbi combination lunch ($13) was so big that it could feed 2 ladies.  In all, even the lunch specials are all over $10, they are good deals because of the portion and the quality.    The interior is clean, brightly lit and the decor is contemporary.  The services was a bit slow at lunch time because they seemed to be understaffed."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to when I have a craving for sushi rolls. They have a great selection and they are so good. Also, be warned that most of their rolls are really big. Usually get quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Really good. Esp with the happy hour discount. The service is slow and they almost always get something in the order wrong. But the rolls are great and filling!"}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: 4 Value: 2 Presentation: 5 Overall: 3.8 rounded up to 4  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we're javing today. Today we are trying their fried yam rolls, and a plate of sushi and rolls. Let's dive right into the review.  The fried yam rolls came on a small plate but there were a lot of yam fries piled on top. Trying one of them, it was packed with flavour and crunchiness and I couldn't stop myself from trying another. The plate on the other hand was very well presented. I really enjoyed the rolls but the fish on the pieces of sushi were not as good.  The plate was relatively priced but I would definitely not pay 6 dollars for 6 yam roll pieces. Looking through the other items on the menu, most items are more heavily priced.  They used to have superb service but I feel that has gone down lately. The employees are still very helpful and friendly however.  In conclusion, their sushi pieces are OK but my money would be better spent on the rolls. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember that food is life!"}
{"text":"Hi there. This is one of the best places in markham/richmond hill area. Food is always fresh and portions are pretty huge, the only disadvantage is that there are three different menus and it takes a century to go thought it, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here recently to meet up with some friends over lunch.  Ordered the chirashi don. Very good presentation, quite a large filling meal. Came with salad and miso soup as well.  This place is a smidge on the pricier side, and I really feel there are a few other sushi places where you can get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Everything here was decent. I like that there were larger bento box options. They may be a bit more but great for the big eaters out there.   Salmon love combo $18 - lots of salmon sashimi/sushi and even teriyaki salmon.  Mi Ne special lunch $22 - mixture of sashimi, sushi, shrimp tempura, sweet potato tempura and option of teriyaki chicken or salmon.   Meals come with salad and miso soup.  Althought everything was good nothing really stood out for me."}
{"text":"The experience began with a waiter attending to me moments after I've arrived. I told him \"table for 1\". It took a while for him the find my a seat as the restaurant was very busy tonight. He reassured me from time to time that there will be a seat soon.   I was seated at a bar style table in front of the chef. He greeted me with a warm smile. I then proceeded to look through the menu and within a minute I was able to flag a waitress who took my order. The miso soup and green salad arrived soon after.  When the food arrived, the chef was animated. He smiled and says \"your sushi\". We then had a nice conversation over work and learned that he had been making sushi for over a decade!   The food quality certainly matched the experience. They would courteous and quick to respond. Getting change was a breeze.   I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Got to restaurant on Saturday evening around 550pm and still had to wait 20 mins, lots of empty seats but most were reserved. Highly suggest making reservations on weekend evenings. Ordered combo platter with some rolls. The rolls were not bad, could be better, the sushi and sashimi was good.  The food was good and higher quality than some Japanese restaurants. Great part was that your allowed to pay cash and get 10% discount. So remember to bring cash if you would like a discount.  Overall, great tasting food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food: 7 Quality: 6.5  Environment: 6 Customer service: 5   Even though I been here 3 times it's still a pretty decent place and as my rating states its only \" A-OK.\"   Mi-Ne has alot of advantages over the other japanese restuarants competitors which are,   1. Food portion is larger size than alot of other places. Especially the maki's rolls and hand rolls.  2. This is a personal opinion but the Chirashi bowl is HUGE here, they give you all kinds of assorts sashimi fish and alot of rice. If your a big rice fan than you would love this dish.  3. Again, i'm getting a bit personal but their katsu don is larger size than other places that offer Katsu. It's also a really big portion. They stinghed out on the rice but it still tastes great without rice. ( And did I mention that the Katsu tastes like McNuggets?!!!)  Having been here a few times already I've gotten to try different things every time I come, so to start off the sashimi is standard, nothing too special about it. Tho they give you alot of salmon which is great but I feel that they should balance it out with giving you more of other kinds of fish instead of so many slices of only salmon.   Maki rolls are really big, alot bigger than most places which i find is really good for the value that you pay. The rolls are above average here, I can see that the chefs do put in some more effort in making the rolls compared to other places where they just slap together some maki rolls like as if they were playing with playdoh. So you can tell that there is some effort and care put into the food that you eat which is a good plus for the place.   The pricing is a bit expensive compared to your other sushi restaurants in markham ( not comparing AYCE) But I suppose the price can be substituted for the food portion and quality. But certain things I just find it is a bit overpriced.   The customer service at Mi-Ne is a hit and miss. Sometimes they are very quick and right on when you ask for something and sometimes they can be as slow as a SLOWWPOKEE. LOL Sorry had to use some Pokemon humor there. Anyways, at times they forget simple things like chopsticks or tea, which can be very annoying for some especially when they aren't busy they still forget.   Overall, it's a pretty decent place to go eat if your ever around the area and looking for some good sushi. It's recommended to go a bit early  if your going for dinner on the weekend because alot of people do tend to reserve tables at that place and you have to wait.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food!  Staff: Had a reservation, so was seated quickly. They have a call button on the tables, which I always appreciate, but they also came and checked in quite often. Food came pretty quick as well!  Ambience: I appreciate the sectioning of the restaurant, as it maximized the space but also provided some privacy for our meal. It had a bright and warm environment.  Food: I ordered the Soft Shell Crab Udon, very tasty. I love soft shell crab and appreciate that they put it on the side which helped preserve the crispiness. Had rolls that were shared amongst a group. Every tasted great. Nothing fell apart and ingredients tasted fresh. Price is reasonable but a little on the higher side.  Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I've been looking for a second non-pricey Japanese restaurant to go to in Markham for a while (first one being Osaka), since Osaka's sushi and sashimi aren't up to par compared to their awesome rolls. I decided to try this place out, since the reviews look promising and the photos look very good.  This place is definitely Korean run, you can tell by the language spoken here and the fact they communicate to you in English (they don't speak Cantonese/Mandarin at all). The inside looks like your traditional Japanese restaurant with some stalls that resemble some similarity to Osaka.  Mi Ne was running some specials during my time here, and I decided to try the lobster avocado salad. Honestly, if you're not too hungry but want to dine here, the salad itself will fill you up: It's VERY filling! The salad also comes with a large cucumber slice and some salmon roe placed at the top. It's actually set up quite well!  I also ordered the fanny bay oysters, which were okay. Nothing too spectacular, but edible at least. Same with the lobster tempura; pass but not something I'll order again.  For the main course, I ordered the Mi-Ne sashimi, smoky roll, and golden dragon roll. The Mi-Ne sashimi had decent variety, including sea urchin, ika, tako, and saba with pressed fish roe. The smoky roll was actually my favourite part of the meal as I'm a sucker for cream cheese, and the roll had generous portions of it. The golden dragon roll had an interesting design, but it's basically shrimp tempura with the roll around it. Very filling and tasted decent, but nothing that will blow you away.  Service was excellent and exactly what I expected from a place like this. Overall I'll likely return, though I'll probably gonna give Le Modern across the street a try as well."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and frankly I don't know why I don't come more often. I guess it just didn't cross my mind in the past but after this I'll definitely come more often.  The sushi is fresh and the rolls are very good. Pricing is mid tier, not cheap but still reasonable for the quality. Service is fairly prompt and friendly. Overall a good experience.  P.S. Their lunch menu is very extensive, I had a hard time choosing one among so many choices."}
{"text":"This place is quite good. My first and only experience was take-out and I found it to be a bit on the pricier side. With that said, the value is good. Their sashimi was quite thick (you can almost slice that one piece into 3!) but extremely fresh and delicious! The servers were extremely friendly and courteous, as well as knowledgeable: as I waited, they sat me down at one of the tables and offered me a green tea. The rolls were not just made of rice either, lots and lots of toppings. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for quality sushi."}
{"text":"The decor gives off a zen, dojo kind of vibe that I missed because it was pretty loud around lunch time on a weekday in August.   I shared the avocado and crab salad ($10) and the spicy salmon and rainbow roll ($16 for 9 pcs) with my mom. The salad was delicious, with the most perfect avocado I've ever seen (I'm a sucker for good avocado... or any avocado) and good for sharing between two people. The spicy salmon was large with a generous portion of salmon inside - definitely the best I've ever had.  Presentation on both dishes was beautiful and all the staff were kind and attentive. I also really like the fact that they give strips of gum instead of mints with the bill - my brother's face literally lit up when he saw it.  I'll definitely come back to try other rolls!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in, there was no one to greet us, but I'm assuming they aren't that busy all the time, so that's fine. We were seated shortly after when a passing server spotted us. My group of 3 were seated in this very intimate (left) area of the restaurant, where you are separated from the group next to you by panels. Good area for date night.   We were promptly given menus and tea. Their menu isn't the most organized document you'll ever come across, so you may spend more time than usual finding what you want because it isn't categorized like how you'd think.   I ended up being basic and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki Lunch Special for $11. My group also shared a (sushi) Boston Roll for $14. Our food arrived in an acceptable amount of time, and was plated beautifully. My salmon teriyaki tasted great, but no different than other places that also serve the same dish for a similar price. The Boston Roll was also very filling. I only had two pieces but their fill is as large as a toonie. Service was pleasant; we were checked on throughout our stay. Some staff members wore traditional Japanese uniforms, so that was pretty neat. Washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times and an easy recommendation for anyone who likes Japanese food.  So what've we got here?  You can't go wrong with their food.  I don't eat sushi (which may discredit this review a little), but whatever I've had has been good.  Off the top of my head: The tempura is really good - cooked perfectly and not overly battery, udon's yummy - not chewy with tasty soup.  I've had their yakitori and it's good... when cooked properly.  I find the chicken is dry sometimes so it's not a top food item.  They have a tendency to forget an item here or there and sometimes they ask if you want the bill before offering dessert.  So what they can work on a little is that their service is a little inconsistent.  Whenever I order anything tempura related, I always say 'sweet potato only' and I'm not sure they've gotten this right, once.  A handful of times, they bring sweet potato with shrimp (which I don't eat), we tell them and the conversation has been (more than once), \"I asked for sweet potato only\" \"Yeah, this is it\" *points to sweet potato and shrimp* ...No.  The very weird thing is that this has happened to me at other Japanese places and I have zero idea why.  So it's a little disappointing to not get everything at once for my meal.  They do price a little high, but relative to other Japanese places?  Maybe not.  You will want a reservation if you're going any time between 5:00 and 8:00pm.  They get super busy and there's not a ton of room to wait unless you want to go outside.  Parking's plentiful so no problem there.  Any problems this place has stem from small little things and they just need to clean that up and I'll be more than happy to change this to a 5 star review.  This place is generally loved by family and friends alike and they have a right to.  Really good, just not perfect yet."}
{"text":"I called for takeout for 2 people, and asked the lady on the other side of the phone which platter she recommends. After mentioning that it was for 2 girls, she strongly recommended me the small combination platter (see photo). It was almost $90 after tax, steep for a \"$$\" level restaurant, but I just assumed it was some next level bomb platter that they specialize in. There were no photos on their website and I was calling in, so I had no idea how big it was.   The ladies there were super nice and welcoming. I was told to pick it up in 30-35 minutes but it took me only 20 minutes to arrive. Instead of waiting in my car, I decided to wait in the restaurant instead. Surprisingly, my platter was ready.   They put it in a bag and everything before they took it out. But after I got home, I realized how HUMONGOUS the platter is...it's good to feed a family of 5..... We were only able to finish 40% of the food.  Even though I felt  like I got ripped off, the price is definitely good for the quantity of food. Not the freshest fish, but you do get a horrifying amount of food....."}
{"text":"I used to think pretty highly of this restaurant.  Girlfriend just tried to make a reservation.. conversation went as follows:  \"Hi I'd like to make a reservation for 2!\" \"Can you call back after 4?  We are VERY busy right now!\" *click*.  This is the second time I've had reservation problems here.  The quality of food here used to be good, until recently when I hear about friends having stomach problems and personally experiencing fish that is stale.  Something has changed here."}
{"text":"best uptown sushi ever! not only do they have amazing sushi, they have awesome customer service as well. one of the few asian restaurants that would check up on you while you dine to make sure you didn't need anything and is enjoying your food! it was also my fiance's birthday and they gave him free cake and played the birthday song for him as well as sang! they made him wear a birthday hat and took a polaroid for us too! so cute!!"}
{"text":"After taking a break from coming here, I started craving their food again. My most recent visit was much better than the last.  Service was attentive and fast despite the restaurant being packed.   We tried one of the items on the menu called the Garden Roll which I really enjoyed. The roll contained mango, salmon, spicy tuna, avocado, cucumber, flying fish roe wrapped in soy bean paper. Ponzu sauce was drizzled over for added flavour. This was a really refreshing and light roll. There was enough flavour so no soy sauce or wasabi was required. The only complaint is that it's a very fragile roll.   We had our other regular menu items like the seafood udon, salmon sushi pizza and California rolls which were all still really delicious.   Will be going back more frequently again!"}
{"text":"We came here during happy hour which has a discount of at least 10% (maybe even 15 or 20% I don't remember). Anyways, it was pretty empty because we came before 5 pm and as expected the food came out pretty fast. The service was decent and they were pretty polite and professional. Not sure how the surface would be during peak hours though.  I actually enjoyed almost every dish that was brought out. We had the dinner set with salmon sashimi, cooked salmon, tempura and spicy chicken Jap chae which was $28. We also had the soft shell crab udon which was $18. These prices are excluding the discount. The cooked salmon and spicy chicken jap chae was decent, by no means bad. I enjoyed the soft shell crab udon, never had a dish like that before. The portions were actually pretty large, and the food was decent so I'm happy with that. We got a bang for our buck I believe, but that's also because we had the discount!"}
{"text":"I've come to this place on two consecutive Fridays already and look forward to coming here again.   My first time here, I ordered the beef teriyaki zen and my sister ordered the seafood teriyaki. Neither of us expected the size of the portions. They were massive! The food tasted really great. The beef teriyaki was cooked to my exact liking, so I gobbled it all down very quickly. The service was good too. It was a Friday night, so it is to be expected that service might be a bit slow given how busy the place gets on weekends. However, they thought of a way to mitigate this by having call buttons at every table. So, you no longer have to wait and try really hard to flag someone down if you need anything. You simply press the button and someone comes to see you asap! Super cool.   The following week (this Friday), my sister and I came back but with her husband this time. He was super hungry and was really hoping to go to an AYCE and we did a pretty good job convincing him this was going to be worth it. Him and I ended up ordering the love boat, whereas my sister stuck to her preferred choice of seafood teriyaki. Oh man... That love boat was definitely made with love. Everything on it was so good!! There was plenty of sashimi, sushi and maki for the two of us. My brother in law actually nearly fell into a food coma and could not finish some remaining pieces. He admitted that this was most definitely worth it. I loved everything I tried. The salmon sashimi was SO soft and did not taste fishy at all. Just overall yummy-ness!   I would most definitely come back and look forward to trying something new!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Mi-Ne Monday night and forgive me for the late review the itis wouldn't permit me to wrote any sooner..lol!  We made reservations but the restaurant is quite spacious so you might not need to unless it's a busier night or a weekend. There is plenty of parking as the lot is shared with many other restaurants in the plaza. They accept debit and most credit cards and the servers are very attentive.  The four of us ordered 4 dishes to share and that was plenty of food...we all ended up taking home leftovers. We ordered off the regular menu (they have a bunch of specials all the time so be sure to ask and check the specials menu). Bf and i had the jalapeno popper and a mixed 9 dynamite roll and 9 salmon rolls and let me tell you this was more than enough. The jalapeno  appetizer is huge and very rich. Not spicy but definitely has a kick. Our friends had an appetizer and roll set and also ended up opting to take almost half home.  Very generous portions and pricing is very fair especially considering portion sizes and freshness of the food.  This was my second time visiting, the first time we had a boat and it ended up being tons of food so if I go back, which I plan to do I'll be ordering off menu again."}
{"text":"Cute place, food was okay. Got the Orangeville roll and was disappointed. There just wasn't much flavour, only the two out of the 9 had spicy flavours on top which was really good but the rest were sad. Went for two and total was $50 which was not worth it for what I but I got full so it was okay. Service was really poor, the waitress gave 0 fucks about us, only the male waiter was good. They prioritize caucasians so if you're white, go there! You'll get lots of service. We sat beside a white couple and they got everything first despite arrive after us and ordering after"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot! Excellent service, delicious food, and reasonable price. Although we walked in with no reservations for Sunday dinner, the host was eager to quickly find us a table for 4. Quoted a 30 minute wait, but was seated in about 10 minutes. Ordered two set dinners for 2 (combo A and B). Waitress warned that may be too much food but we ordered anyways. Each combo comes with - seaweed salad - mushroom soup - choice of mixed tempura or oyster tempura - sushi/sashimi & maki - teriyaki and rice (chicken, beef, or salmon) - ice cream  We were full before the teriyaki came and asked for that to be packed to go. (Waitress was totally right!)  If you pay cash it's 10% off."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance atmosphere. Business clients are a great way to find here for lunch. Not too busy. Great food with very good portions. I had the lunch combo salmon box with tempura loving every piece of it. Lots of good choices."}
{"text":"The perks of having a fellow elite yelper as a friend is you get first dibs on their discovery. After being recommended Hubby wanted to try this place right away which is usually a rare occasion. Boy (or Girl..) it did not disappoint at all. Interior wise very nice, almost authentic Japanese with paper wall divisions giving you and your group some privacy. Call Buttons are available for servers to visit you. Service was quite good , attentive and friendly as it should be.  Menu had an extensive choice of Japanese dishes CAUTION: You will have a hard time Choosing. TIP : Choose your dish early, it will take a good 5-10 min to pick out what to get unless you know what you're craving for. Came here twice now and had ordered their Chef Special #2 . It came with (Let's see if I can remember all..) Complimentary Miso and Salad Salmon Sashimi , A handful of rice only ( small - trust me you wouldn't need much after I'm done enumerating) , Spicy Bulgogi , Shrimp Tempura (Big) , Lobster (yes, you heard right LOBSTER tempura), Salmon Head and Neck Terriyaki ( From the size I think it came with the Shoulders too), Sautéed Vegetables ( you will find in a bed under the Salmon Head) . The overly excited Sir to my left had his Chirashi. The highlight of both our evening was the Sashimi . Common to all Japanese restaurant - yes. What is uncommon to us Lovers of Sashimi is the fact its cut sooo thick (thicker than when you spell THICK) consistently to all the slices. It allows you to enjoy the Sashimi flavor swirled in your mouth.  After we ate here we came to an enlightened thought of sorts (Yup, its THAT good :p) Though ala carte you're full to the rim like you would feel in an AYCE Japanese place. Variety is just as you would at an AYCE. Ala Carte at MI NE or Buffet at another place - is about the same, you're belly is just one size. Priced a bit more than most ala carte places but you definitely get the value with their portions and quality. LOVE this place. We saw the other table order the Boat, Let's just say better for you to go to this place and see for yourselves what I saw rather than me telling you here. Just be stomach ready though ;)."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the first time tonight. I was seated promptly, but my hot tea came ten minutes later. Another ten minutes later, I could finally place my order. I suppose that is why there is a Call button on the table, but it seems weird to have one at such a nice restaurant.   Food portions are huge! I ordered the tempura, which included shrimp. I also ordered the gyoza udon, which was piping hot. You must be careful not to burn your tongue!  The two huge cubes of pineapple were a nice touch to the meal. I would have given four stars, but it took fifteen minutes to get the bill. It wasn't that busy tonight. I hope that the slow service tonight isn't the norm."}
{"text":"They know their fish.  Everytime I go the quality  of the fish has always been good.  Typically, u might get a sour taste with sub par sushi resturants.  You pay a little more but you also get more.  I enjoy their tea as well."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I didn't have a review on Mi-Ne.  This is definitely our go-to place for sushi!  We usually come here for dinner or come before 5pm to get the Early Bird special (20%off everything except sashimi or 10% off sashimi and additional 5% off for cash payment).  My daughter and I usually get the Matsu or Take Sushi set.  The sets have a great variety of sushi and super fresh.  And there's no extra charge if you want to make changes like make it all salmon.  We also like getting the Unagi (eel) Don which I think it's one of the best.  If you love unagi rice bowl then you must come try it here - mixed with avocado, cucumber, cooked eggs, and fish eggs.  The selection of hot udon soup is also amazing here.  Our favourite is the mushroom udon.  You should also make reservations if you are coming on the weekends as the place does get pretty full."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and sister at around 6:15 during a Sunday night~  The atmosphere was really nice and I love how all the waitresses wear kimonos~  The food is very good overall! I love their uni special, super fresh and yummy and for a super good deal! The chefs actually shows you the live uni before serving it to show you it's fresh!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE their oyster udon as well! Tangy noodles in a refreshing broth and big juicy oysters = PERFECTION!  I was impressed with all the dishes I ordered and its all for a very good price.  Service was really friendly as well, however the only thing that bothered me was that when more people started coming into the restaurant, they immediately placed the bill on our table even though we didn't have our dessert yet :(  I guess its understandable that they just want to start serving the next round, but I was kind of mad because my pet peeve for restaurants is feeling rushed out :$ But the food makes up for it so it's all good! :D  Overall a wonderful place to go to for fresh seafood! But make sure to come early if you don't want to wait because their lines do get quite long!"}
{"text":"The quality has really gone down in this place...   I went last weekend and got the love boat remembering how good it was. But to my disappointment, the quality was just horrible. Particularly their sashimi, which tasted like it was defrosted. Not only that, it was sliced into huge chunks that it felt like chewing into raw meat.  Honestly don't know what happened to this place as I remember it being pretty good. Maybe they changed owners or the chef. Either way, I don't think I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with husband around 12 pm  it was very nice and bright inside you're greeted and seated right away.  They have a button on the table you can press when you're ready to order  Husband got the 6pcs Salmon roll & 6pcs California roll combo came with soup and salad $12  The portions were really big More fish over rice, which was nice. Fish was really fresh and we liked that it came on a bamboo like board.  I ordered the California roll combo  which came with 8pcs of big and thick California roll and 2 small California roll. Also came with soup and salad. $11 At first i didn't know why they had big and small California roll, but the \"big\" one came with the Japanese style eggs inside as well. Came on a bamboo like board as well.  They accept credit. lots of parking.  Overall, will be coming back. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I feel this place is beginning to grow on me. The first time I came I thought the service was really slow and that they definitely needed more staff, but I think that has improved since. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming. They do their quality checks to ensure guest satisfaction.   The portion of their food, especially maki rolls come in really big pieces so it is quite filling. You don't have to order a lot in order to get full. The sashimi and live uni is fresh. I quite enjoy their spicy scallop maki and their kalbi dinner.   I'd really like to go back to try their speciality rolls since every time I've been here I've ordered sets/boats to share that do not include their specialty rolls. There is always left overs because the maki rolls are so big, not filled with rice but with actual ingredients which is good. You get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Food - Higher end ingredients such as lobster and oyster.  Dishes are well presented and fresh.  The maki rolls are great though I think I prefer their cooked dishes as they are really well done and flavourful.  2. Portions - Portions are generous and appropriate given the higher price.  Go for Chef's Course Dinners as they are generally more worth it.  3. Service - Friendly and prompt.  Can't ask for much more.  Worth it? For sure.  Not much wrong with this place.  I typically like the Korean run sushi places.  This restaurant stands apart from others due to higher end ingredients and good execution."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighbourhood sushi place in the harbourfront / cityplace area. The sushi is always fresh, served quickly and always always delicious. The only qualms we have about coming here is the price. it does add up a bit and it is mroe expensive then other spots in the city. The menu is HUGE and their sushi pizza is awesome. The sashimi is delicious an di love their unique assortment of specialty rolls. We continue to come back.  Dinner usually around 70.00 for two."}
{"text":"Ingredients are always fresh. Do expect your bill to be more expensive but you do get your money's worth, their rolls are much bigger. The orangeville roll is a must order!   There's a bell on each table but you may have to wait a bit regardless, they seem to be understaffed most of the time.   Discount if you pay by cash for dinner."}
{"text":"2.5 Star rounding up to 3 because I still think my last lunch experience was good!  Back to Mi Ne for dinner. I left a little confused and disappointed.  Ordered the same items I usually order at the other Mi Ne on Yonge Street location: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mi-ne-japanese-richmond-hill, which I am not sure if they are related as it has a separate individual website http://www.minesushi.net/ different than the other 3 locations!  Chicken Zen ($20) & Chirashi ($19)  - California Roll probably the best item I enjoyed, it is big but just have a really thin layer of rice, fresh and enjoyable - Portion is huge in a way that you will be full but from RICE! My chirashi was not bad but was served with 3 bowl of rice! The shari rice was even lacking the flavour! - Nigri Sushi has the same issue as the pieces are huge with so much rice! Not really balanced! - Tempura batter was heavy, soggy and quite oily!  Mi Ne might be trying to give customer a sense of value by giving people a lot of carbs so they get full from eating. But it just lost the delicate character of Japanese cuisine. If I really want to fill up, I would have ate in one of  the numerous AYCE places in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place. You get a lot of food for your money. We often get the love boat or some other assortment of food. For around $80 you get soups, salad, wine, a large boat full of sushi that can feed 4 people, and dessert"}
{"text":"We drive all the way from downtown to Markham (yes, I know they have a downtown location, never been) to have Mi-Ne sushi! Their special rolls are the BEST!! Caterpillar roll as well as Crunch roll are the must try!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when coming in, was just craving some japanese food. Came out amazed at the service and the taste of the food. My girlfriend and I had the tuna lover roll and golden dragon roll and we were blown away by the portion of the food and the taste. We left feeling more full than when we went to an all you can eat. Definitely worth coming here, and you can expect me to be coming back!"}
{"text":"I find this better than the Richmond Hill one. I think they might rotate the chefs though so keep that in mind.  Everything at this location will be $1 more expensive than the RIchmond Hill one.  Everything is relatively the same but this location, maybe I'm biased or maybe it's because I'm being influenced by the extra dollar out of my pocket, I feel that the plating is just a little more awesome and the food a little more tasty.  Atmosphere-wise, it bigger than the Richmond Hill one and the parking lot is bigger.  However there is one thing that this one has over the RH location is the manager specials.  Man their are delicious.  Pricey but I love them to death and if I feel like I should reward myself, it what I will get.  Last time it was a Grilled Hamachi Head with mini chirashi. This time its mini Korean oyster udon with a sashimi lunch box."}
{"text":"This is a nice quiet place for a family lunch/dinner or with a group of friends. I like their service - you ring a bell for service and this ensures timely and efficient service.   I usually get their combination lunch - choose from either beef, chicken, or salmon. It comes on a bed of veges, some salad, rice, bean sprouts and a few slices of oranges. On a separate platter, there are three pieces of maki and nigiri. Quite tasty and flavourful. I definitely would say that their Markham location has more variety and better quality than the Bremner location.   The green dragon roll is quite good as well - they put a generously sufficient amount of avocado on top and stuff the maki with veges.   Overall - good quiet environment, quality food at an average price.   Come for happy hour and get a discount on maki!"}
{"text":"I found this place quite average, nothing particularly blew my mind that would make me come back. I did like how their menu has a good variety of rolls, bento boxes, combos, stone bowl soups/noodles etc. I didn't however like how massive one piece of a roll was. It could barely fit in my mouth which distracted me from enjoying the taste. Overall the service was attentive and friendly given how empty the restaurant was on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Some of the best rolls I have ever had, I'm really impressed with the quality and how generous they are with their cuts! I was skeptical at first because the prices were a bit steeper than I usually pay for sushi lunch combos but it was worth it. I got the maki roll set lunch special (3 pcs spicy salmon roll, 9pc rainbow roll) for $17+tax. It was super filling and satisfying, I thought it wasn't going to be enough but I had to beg my boyfriend to finish a few pieces for me! He ordered the beef teriyaki lunch special which was decent but honestly, if you're going to come here - just get their rolls. I'll definitely come back when I feel like I need to splurge on some good maki rolls!"}
{"text":"My friend dragged me to the restaurant with the promise of it having the \"best sushi rolls\" and she was not wrong.   The wait on a Saturday night around 8pm was about 20 minutes for a table for two. After being seated, we promptly ordered the \"Orangeville\" roll and the \"Green Dragon\" roll. With the restaurant being really busy, we waited 30 minutes before the food arrived.   The two rolls had around 9 pieces each and were about 15$ each. Like other reviewers have said, each roll will fill you right up with its huge portions. The Orangeville roll consisted of salmon, avocado, rice, spicy scallop, and a tobiko mixture. The Green Dragon roll consisted of avocado, rice, shrimp tempura. Both were tasty with its mixtures of sauces and ingredients.   Overall, I would give this restaurant a 4 star for its creative sushi options. The service was slower than I would have liked which is why I knocked off a star, but I would most definitely come again despite that."}
{"text":"Wow. Very nicely done. Gyoza soup was sizzling when served. Generous portions of sushi meat. Very hearty and tasty roll. Really glad I got here before seven. It got crowded quickly. Go early and you won't go home hungry"}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes to ask 3 times for water! Besides that, the food here is good. Better than normal!"}
{"text":"Round and round i drove, searching for this restaurant.  Finally i called my friend to ask her where it is located.  Turns out it's at the corner of a plaza.  And it's no wonder i didn't see it despite passing it a few times.  The restaurant signage wasn't lit up. Other than that, the food was ok.  My friend and i ordered a 12 piece Matsu Sushi assorted platter to share between us, and it also came with 6 pieces of roll ($24).  we also ordered Avocado Crab Salad ($10) which was tasty and crunchy.  Both dishes were nicely presented as expected from a Japanese restaurant.  But all in all, the sushi were nothing extra unique. Decent place to go if you are craving sushi.  I will likely go back next time to try their sashimi platter."}
{"text":"I am torn between giving this place a 3 or a 4 only because of the service!   The food itself is excellent. No complaints here! You get a generous amount of fish in all your rolls and all their other dishes are yummy. I had bibimbap there for the firsts time and enjoyed it; I also had the spicy salmon which has a nice amount of spice, and good amount of the tempura crispy bits mixed in. Overall, I do enjoy the food.  There is lots of parking as it is located in a good size plaza. The strip mall allows for lots of parking.   The service is what gets me every time and turns me off. I find it to be overall slow. We went last night just after the main dinner rush, so around 9PM and it was still not good. We got seated, but had to wait for the menus at the table, once we finally got them we had to wait quite a while to place our order. Then they only brought out one tea (table of two) and the second tea quote a while after. We each clearly ordered our own separate dinners but the only thing they brought out at the same time was the miso soup. After the soup they only brought out one item at a time with very long breaks in between. At the end, when we were ready to pay, they split the bill for us but she was only there to process the first bill. I felt bad just leaving so I did the second one myself... I would think they would at least be on top of charging you for your food! Dinner itself ended up taking probably an hour and a half or so."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and everything has remained consistent during each visit. The simple Japanese themed interior makes for a good place to come with friends and family. The service is good and the servers are nice.  The portions of the food are on the bigger side and the rolls are definitely packed full of ingredients. There is a side menu with a variety of rolls to choose from, more selection than a lot of other places. Chose the spider roll and it came on a really long thin plate. The soft shell crab was crispy and surrounded by just the right amount of sushi rice. The dinner special came with a lot, tempura shrimp and lobster, an assorted choice of sashimi and sushi, teriyaki chicken and even an oyster. Only complaint is that the tempura lobster was not done too well. It was dipped in too much batter and was not fried all the way through.  Overall, definitely coming back for more. Top choice place to go for a non all you can eat Japanese food meal."}
{"text":"Saturday nights are always busy we waited for about half an hour to get seated so make sure to reserve a table if you can! We ordered the large combination platter with a variety of sashimi, sushi, and rolls and shared amongst five people. We were very full after and there were also leftovers so this would be good for six people too. The fish was pretty fresh and the rolls are massive! Spicy salmon roll is very yummy would definitely order that again. Service could be a little better, it took a while for us to get someone to bring us more tea. Comes with cute pre-cut oranges after your meal so that's a nice touch! Also not sure if they did this on purpose but when we paid for our meal (separate bills) the server left us the machine to punch in our own amounts lol. I actually didn't mind that but it was definitely a first! Overall a bit pricey but delicious sushi nonetheless."}
