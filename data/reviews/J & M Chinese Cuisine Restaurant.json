{"text":"Maybe the food is good, I have no idea. I was just very turned off by the interaction I had on the phone. I just moved to the area and was looking on yelp for some good Chinese delivery, and searched by proximity to my house. The person taking my order first told me she didn't know where my address was so I tried explaining it to her, she said that maybe it was too far away and they don't go more than 10 miles. I then told her that the map said it was only 8 miles and she proceeded to tell me that was too far. Perhaps she was busy, but she was short and basically hung up on me after that. I might expext that on a Friday or Saturday but it's Wednesday. Maybe I'll try again, but it may be a while before the terrible interaction is gone from my memory."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from this restaurant many times, and it has always been delicious.  The lemon chicken and lemon shrimp are so good!  The portions are large and the food is always hot when it gets here.   However, the food we got today was not up to the usual quality we have come to expect.  The fried rice was not fried rice at all, but steamed rice mixed with soy sauce.  What's up with that?  Also, there were very few noodles in the pork lo mein.  There was one piece of broccoli in the lemon shrimp, none in the lemon chicken.  It was still good, but not nearly as good as it was in the past.  The crab puffs, however, were delicious, and the spring rolls were really good.  I'm thinking they are cutting corners to save money.  That's a shame....raise the price a bit and keep the quality!"}
{"text":"I can't say I found the food to be anything other than \"very\" Americanized Chinese food. On the positive side, the staff are nice and the prices are extremely cheep."}
{"text":"I have coming here for awhile I have tried a lot of their dishes and I am impressed they are all so good. They have really good sized portions always enough for later. the easiest way to try different dishes is to order 2 different dishes and see what is good I like their walnut shrimp it is delicious   I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Really not great. My family loves Chinese food and they weren't impressed. Beef with broccoli was a little pungent, fish sauce I get, but this wasn't it. Mu shu chicken was downright bitter. Very disappointing. Kung pao was decent, passable. We would have really liked the wonton soup if the winging weren't soggy. The service was very friendly but we will look elsewhere for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for a long time I like their consistency their food taste delicious I love their crab puffs they are so good.  I also love the fact they deliver they charge 2.00 they have a huge radius that they deliver to the staff is nice"}
{"text":"We ordered a large order for a big family meal and everything was really good. Favorites were teriyaki chicken and Mongolian beef. House noodles were also good. I asked for them to deliver at 4:30 and on the dot the door bell rang! Appreciate the good service!. Will be trying again."}
{"text":"listen carefully i ordered food and picked it up. i have the receipt. after i left they added a $10.00 tip! this is the absolute truth. my cc company notified me of the charge. this is fraud!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! My pick up order was ready for pick up in 10-15 minutes. They added egg in my fried rice but once I told them I was allergic, they made me a new batch of rice and had me check it before I left. I appreciate them ensuring that My food was how I wanted it before I left."}
{"text":"I learned of J & M when their menu was stuck into my front door.  They boast \"New York Style\" Chinese cuisine, and it is really good.  We have only ever ordered for delivery (rare these days, it seems), and we have not been disappointed once!  My faves: wonton soup, spring rolls, Szechuan Garlic Chicken, and J & M house chicken.  They deliver in East Mesa only, between McDowell Rd, Recker Rd, Elliot Rd, and Meridian Rds, as well they have seating at their establishment.  (FYI $20 minimum order for delivery) The staff is really friendly, and the owner even delivered once!"}
{"text":"My wife's dish was just okay, and the order I had last week was also just okay, maybe 3 stars at best. But today, the food I ordered is toxic. They must have cleaned the wok with cleaner and did not rinse it out. My food has an extreme smell of cleaning fluid or soap of some kind and is burning my mouth and throat after one bite (it was just veggies and tofu, nothing hot, and it is not that kind of burning - I mean like a chemical burn, not peppers) I'm saving some for the doctor, throwing the rest out now, inducing vomiting and going to the emergency room. Stay away from this place unless you want to be poisoned.   And my pick up order - for two dishes - came in half of a cut open cardboard box from like coca cola or something and leaked all over the box and my leather car seats. I'm just hoping that is the worst of my problems and whatever soap or cleaner the just fed me doesn't ending making me sick or killing me."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times because as the other poster said there can be off nights. At first it was ok...not good but really the only thing close by. It declined in that we got sick after eating this...twice. We will NEVER ear here again and will drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for seriously great food! If you haven't already, you need to try the sizzling rice soup. It's fabulous, filled with vegetables, and fills you up! The service is great AND they deliver in Mesa. My all-time favorite place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"If zero stars were an option that would be my selection. Waited an hour for food and the food had no flavoring whatsoever. If you're busy, that's fine. I get it. But, if you're busy you also know you're busy and/or understaffed. Let your guests know that before they sit down or order. Nobody expects to wait an hour for food to show up, no matter the time, day, or season. As far as the food itself, the chicken teriyaki had no taste at all. I couldn't even tell I was eating chicken or teriyaki. Needless to say, I left here wanting more, wanting to feel like I had dinner. Sadly, that didn't happen and I'm still hungry yet being full from \"food\" I wish I didn't eat or wait for."}
{"text":"I ordered the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef TO-GO one night to have dinner with my boyfriend. It was quite good.  I've been to some Chinese Restaurants where their Orange Chicken is either not crispy enough or drenched with sauce. However, their orange chicken had just the right amount of sauce and though it wasn't crispy, the chicken tastes really good.   The price was not bad either. I believe they were each like $8 or $9 because my total bill was about $18-$19.   I believe a lot of people order take-out because I got there, there were two people in front of me and one behind me having take-out. The restaurant looks pretty cute and clean. It is small but it feel homey. There was a couple that came in after me that dined in so it wasn't too, too dead (haha).   Overall, I really liked it and will order again. Perhaps take-out again :D"}
{"text":"Visiting from California, my family and I were on our way driving to the Apache Trail for the scenic views and decided to stop by this place to see how Arizona Chinese food compares to back home. The food was tasty and comparably good! Nice atmosphere and cool fish tank! Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"The food is extremely bland. We ordered sesame chicken and chicken lo mein with fried rice. Of the 3, only the lo mein had any flavor. It's definitely not worth the $10.50 for a dinner combo."}
{"text":"Great for take out.  We always love it and they are accommodating (adding crispy noodles for the kids soup etc.).  Food is hot and tasty.  Little slow on dine in- in their defense it was busy.  Told them we were in a hurry and it still took quite a while.  That said, I would still highly recommend.  Great food!!"}
{"text":"I chose not to write a review on our first attempt at this place because anyone can have an off night. However our second time was too much like the first, When you first walk in it smells like frying rotten eggs or sewer gas.  the menus were sticky and nasty. If you ask any questions prepare for the deer in headlight look. 99% of the time won ton soup does not have seafood in it. We missed that on the menu and when we told the lady we missed it but my wife can't have that direct of a contact with seafood the response was \"you want me to pull it out ?\"  We said no thanks we would try another soup, Response \"Fine, no soup\". Before the lady came back to reclaim the friend wontons our 8 year old had grabbed one to munch on and spit it out saying how awful it was, I took a nibble of it and it was STALE.  The BBQ Rib started was so microwaved hot you couldn't hold it. By the time you could it was rock hard and dried out.  The sesame chicken was just below Panda express quality but edible.  The Sweet and sour pork was about the same.  The Honey chicken was completely disgusting. The only this you could taste was soy sauce and fish sauce to the point of over bitter. The wife never tried it because I could smell the level of fish sauce.  Just for kick I took a few pieces of it home with the sweet and sour for the dogs. They liked the sweet and sour but refused the honey chicken.   So my advice, go to panda or someother place like that in the mall.  Oh and that smell when we walked in, it got bad everytime the lady walked over to us. Maybe a bath is needed."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We used to live down the street and would go once a week.  Now, we still stop in whenever we're on this side of town.  I always get the chicken with vegetables from the healthy menu.  They also have really great sizzling rice soup and crab puffs.  My family loves the orange chicken and Lo Mein and everyone's happy.  I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yoooooo this place is lit. Tastes authentic, amazing, ww love their orange chicken & chicken lomein. Always ready on time, phone calls are always answered"}
{"text":"Love this place. Right on my corner. Prices could be a little cheaper but overall I recommend."}
{"text":"Has been our go to place for years. Family owned and operated, great quality and food price. Lynn is a Co/ Owner and runs the front of the house, very friendly and will go out of her way to serve you. My wife loves the green bean and chicken off menu special and to our amazement Lynn has gone next door to Bashas on several occasions to buy green beans just for my wife when they are out. They have a great carry out and delivery menu and can get very busy on Friday and Saturday evenings. Never disappointed in the service or the food, just love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery,  food was hot and fresh with fast delivery.   Very good shrimp cashew."}
{"text":"Had kung pao beef and it was tender.  I prefer kung pao with actual red peppers, they used powder.  But still it was tasty, but not very spicy.  Also had hot and sour soup, it was good, but not great  The order was ready when I showed up, a definite plus.  The price was reasonable.  I might try it again to see what else they have."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Everything is hot, fresh and very well prepared. I'm very picky about Chinese food, coming from the Northeast. I've been to many Chinese places in Phoenix and most are sub par, but this place is top of the list. I'm so glad I live nearby. Prices are average but the servings are very generous. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The prices are great and the portions are huge.   It's not the best I've ever had but the food is tasty.  Service can be slow but they always get the order right.  We like eating out here as it's consistent and the food is good."}
{"text":"This was by far some of the best Chinese food we have ever had!  It was a mess when we went to go pick it up but it was definitely worth the hassle.  The staff was real gracious & nice about the mishap.  Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I found this place in Yelp, so I at least started with some optimism ;) I wasn't disappointed. Great portions and plenty of variety. Got egg rolls, mu shu pork, house low mein,  Mongolian beef, rice and 4 fortune cookies, soy sauce, and hot mustard for about $30 plus tip. Plenty of leftovers after stuffing myself ;)  Everything tasted as expected, though the egg rolls and Mongolian beef were better than most... Not crazy great, but really good for take out/delivery. Now if they only made Chinese turkey for Christmas!!"}
{"text":"I am trying to eat healthy so I do not eat take out much these days. But I happened to be in the mood for some chinese food and did not have things needed to make any. That is where J & M came in to the picture. I remembered that they delivered, so after looking them up on Yelp I called and placed my order. Now let me say that the food has been good both times I have eaten here. The rice seems fresh and the orange chicken I ordered even had real orange zest in it.  The egg rolls while not greasy seemed a little cold but nothing a microwave can't fix right?  They even threw in a large glass of ice for my 2 liter of coke lol. Yes I have always had a pretty good experince with them except when it comes to the wait time for the food to be delivered. I kid you not it took almost a full hour just to recive my order. But I will chalk this up to the driver most likely getting lost. Try this place out when you don't feel like cooking and want something besides pizza.  Note: Like everyone said before me they do have a $20 minimum order for delivery."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp (and other) online reviews, I ordered delivery from this restaurant for the first time. Absolutely delicious!! Delivery time was about 40 minutes. It was delivered hot and the delivery guy was very friendly. Will definitely order from them again. They're much closer than the normal Chinese restaurant we eat at and they deliver. Win-win!"}
{"text":"Hands down best chinese food delivery I've had in the valley. Everything is awesome and delivery is fast.   Crab puffs are the bomb!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a to-go lunch.  I've been eating here for the past 3+ years while working in the area.  I really like that they give you soup with lunch when you order it to-go.  Too many places give you soup with the lunch combo, but then they skimp when you order it to-go and do not give you the soup with it.  J & M II does not skimp on the soup, and it's very tasty!  With lunch you get the entrée of your choice, soup, plain fried rice, spring roll, and crab puff.    Skip the Lo Mein,  get the Kung Pao Chicken or Cashew Chicken and ask for it spicy!"}
{"text":"So far the experience has been just swell very kind very courteous very polite lady on the phone I hope the food is equally as enjoyable. They can give the people at Golden China a lesson or two on phone etiquette. Well after a bit of a wait my food arrived and it was spectacular made me feel like I was home in San Francisco delicious lemon chicken pork fried rice was awesome above average food fifth star added for great taste.....yummmmm!"}
{"text":"I was really quite happy with myself when I stumbled upon this little restaurant.  I ordered a few different things to eat while i was there and take home to the kids whatever I couldn't finish. I wanted to sample  quite a few of their different dishes. Let's just say I ended up eating more then I should of just so I didn't have to share. I can't wait to find myself back in the neighborhood just so I can stop back by."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a picky eater, and I don't know how authentic it is, but regardless, J&M does good food. When they deliver it always comes piping hot and never disappoints. When you order for a family like we do it can be a bit pricy, and it takes about 45 minutes for them to deliver, but other than that it is excellent. Plus, they always throw in these free fried, sugary, dough thingies that are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and I was looking for cheap, close, not Panda Express Chinese food.  I was there on Sunday for lunch.  I was able to order off of the lunch menu :o) and for the awesome price I got great tasty food.  The egg drop was better than most places.  (no funky veggies like corn or carrots), spring roll -  nothing special, chop suey mmmmm.  I'm happy to have my new local carry out joint!"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery at 530 on Thursday.   We were told delivery time 30-45 minutes.  After 60 minutes, we called to check on order and were told 10 minutes away.  705. No one.  Called backed told 10 minutes away.  Cancelled order.  Don't fall for their timeframe."}
{"text":"I'm not going to sit here and tell you that this is the best place for Chinese food. I will however say that for what it is it's pretty good. They are very clean inside and super attentive to their customers. The food quality is good and if you've ever ordered to your home you know that they get stuff right and it doesn't take long for your food to get to you. I enjoy this place and it is good for this side of town."}
{"text":"Our all time favorite Chinese Restaurant! Not a problem with timing, only a few instances of translation issues, regarding some dietary requirements. In that case, they apologized for the mistake. We always have them read it back, to ensure that is adhered to. Any questions, make sure the cashier understands your order.   The traditional items are traditional and the new items are definitely great. Eating in is just as casual.  They could use another television for others eating it vs the mini one for the guests that are waiting for a pick up.   No desserts, but with it being a few steps from BASHA's, there's a grocery store of items!"}
{"text":"We travel all over the country and love Chinese restaurants, ands this small, friendly restaurant is a real gem. The selection is impressive, portions are huge, and everything was delicious. Everything is fresh and cooked to order. The House Fried Rice and the Shrimp Pan Fried Noodles are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered for the 1st & last time! Crab rangoons were too sweet - egg rolls had a weird flavor- the amount of bean sprouts in the fried rice was staggering! The one really good thing was the beef skewers!"}
{"text":"Warm friendly service, and rapid delivery.  Food is NY style chinese and is always hot, fresh and tasty.  We love this little neighborhood  restaurant."}
{"text":"My family likes the restaurant for convenient, fast, and pretty good Chinese food. The waitress is always friendly, and our food comes out quite quickly. I really like the chow fung, but that's simply because I always love those thick, rice noodles.  The style is definitely Americanized Chinese food, but the food quality is always good. I've never had anything bad. The vegetables are always clean and the meats are cooked nice and tender. The restaurant is clean every time we visit, and take out is fast too. J&M can be relied on for fast and decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Gross! We found some weird pellet thing on the Kung pao chicken! It resembled mice or rat poop, totally turned us off and we never will go back again!"}
{"text":"We order from this place because they deliver.  Too often the food comes burnt.  Especially the chicken.  I think the problem is they use old old for the cooking.  Been looking for another Chinese place but haven't found one.  If you eat there chances are the food will be fine."}
{"text":"Always do take out and has always been fresh and tasty. They will do special orders for you too-steam to reduce calories with sauce on side. I saw one review that called it tasteless. Well take out the huge amount of sodium and grease in Chinese food and rely on the sauces. This place is fresh and healthier. If you like greasy and salty go to another Chinese restaurant. I love this place because it is tasty and healthier."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and ordered delivery.  I was told it would be about 45 min and the driver arrived in 30 min! I was very pleased.  The food was well packaged and piping hot when it arrived.  We ordered the orange chicken,  teriyaki chicken,  and sweet n sour chicken.  All 3 were very tasty!!  My sons love Chinese food and were just crazy about this place.  They can't wait to try other dishes, nor can I.  For a Chinese delivery place,  this one is great!"}
{"text":"Most of the times, I order for delivery and sometimes I go dine-in with my family or friends. They have really friendly service and their prices are pretty cheap for the amount of food they give in each order. Sometimes they even give some free crab puffs or soup in our deliveries! I would recommend trying the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and their Wonton Soup. It is the best. Their appetizers are not greasy at all, in other restaurants, their egg rolls and all covered in oil! In J & M's menu, they have healthy choices and it says you can get the food cooked without oil and I think that's good for all those people on a diet out there.  I would recommend this to anyone out their who likes chinese food! If you don't try some anyways, I know it will change your mind. It's not really that expensive, either."}
{"text":"LOVE their egg foo young. I have been coming here for years. My family enjoys their other food,  but I don't remember what they order."}
{"text":"I love this place! Haven't had anything yet that I didn't like. Service is always outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. It's my go to for Chinese. In fact when my parents visit it's their request on where to eat lol!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find this Chinese restaurant. The location is not only close to home, but also delivers in my area.  Checking the menu photos on Yelp, we decide to give it a try.  The restaurant is in a retail strip.  The interior is nothing to write home about.  I don't recall any decor, or anything to stand out.  I ordered tofu vegetables. My husband gets chicken or something. So 'meh', I forget. Sad part is, not even the photos remind me what it was. Maybe chicken and mushrooms? I digress.  After a good while, the food arrives. My food is cold and uncooked. I ask for a to-go container so I can quietly remove it from my sight. And that's when I notice something else: this place is being ravaged by termites. There are trails and cobwebs all over, with even the faux wooden column corners being eaten by bugs. Perhaps it wasn't bugs. Perhaps it was a patron who decided that eating the wood would be better than what they have been served.  Don't waste your time here. I don't at all understand the glittering reviews of this place."}
{"text":"Have no idea how this place has 4 Stars.  The food may be good but we never got a chance to find out.  Waited 15 min to get a menu bad sign to start with. Finally ordered and waited another 40 min to get our appetizer of soup and crab wontons they were ok even though the crab wontons have not crab at all. Then another 15 min pass with no food at all. When food started to leave the kitchen they served the last table to be seated first (they showed up 45 min after we did)  No acknowledgment from the staff no sorry or anything Oh we never got a refill on our drinks even though other tables did  Avoid at all cots"}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant I know of in East Mesa.  J&M II is an NYC style Chinese restaurant.  The family that owns it and prepares the food is from NYC.  If you have ever been to Wo Hop in NYC it is that style of food at J&M II.    We always order take out or delivery but the restaurant itself looks like a nice place to eat at.  It is small but clean and the decor is nice.  However the food is what makes J&M II so good.  Unlike other Chinese restaurants in the area that are bland and boring (like Yen Ching on Power Rd), J&M II puts spice and flavor into their food.   You taste garlic and ginger and bold flavor in the food, especially when you order the dishes \"Extra Spicy\".  Any of the traditional NYC Chinese classics like fried rice or spare ribs or General Tao's chicken or lo mein are good, etc.  However my favorite dish is the Beef Chow Fun ordered Extra Spicy.  It is so good!  You get more food for your money at a buffet like the one down on SIgnal Butte and the 60.  But the quality and flavor of the food is so much better at J&M II.  The food is good quality.  The flavors are bold and delicious.  J&M II is a great Chinese restaurant to try in East Mesa."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was a bad night or what. I was sure I had ordered from here before but I guess not. I was expecting something different. Just not my favorite kind of noodles, not a lot of flavor in the food. I feel like I could have cooked what I got tonight and the reason I order Chinese is because I usually can't cook as good as they do. Delivery person was definetly friendly but the food was pretty cold when it got here also. I amy order from here again if I'm desperate but I will most likely try to find a better place. Or just get off my A and drive to Panda. I ordered chicken Lo mein and Shrimp Lo mein, I ate the Shrimp so maybe my husbands chicken Lo mein was better. The steamed dumplings werent bad tho!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Their Mongolian beef is awesome. We've eaten here twice. It is a little pricy but we haven't had a bad experience. Both times were pick ups, so we didn't eat in store."}
{"text":"The food is fair. Their house Kung Pao sauce has an odd taste.  Chicken with fresh vegetables with sauce on the side was good."}
{"text":"We have tried several Chinese Restaurants in the Mesa area and this establishment is by far the best we have had.  The staff is nice, portions large as would be expected w/Chinese cuisine, and prices are fair.  Pot Stickers, Crab Puffs. Szechuan Green Beans, Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken--all very good!  No NSG!!!"}
{"text":"I'm incredibly confused and would like to know on what planet this would be called \"chow mein\" when it is completely devoid of any noodles whatsoever. Is there a different definition of chow mein that I am unaware of?"}
{"text":"I ate at this location a couple days ago, and I was very disappointed. The chicken was very chewy, and their egg rolls looked grey inside and tasted like someone poured a container of cinnamon in them. The lo mein was all right, but the more I ate the more grossed out I was. The egg drop soup had no taste at all. This was the second time I have tried this location, and both times I ended up throwing half of my order away. The staff is very friendly, but the food is less than appetizing."}
{"text":"New to the area so I thought I'd try them out based on good reviews, never again. Our lo mein was over cooked and mooshy and had no flavor. The general Tsao chicken was overcooked and the sauce tasted like a mix of sweet and sour and Frank's red hot sauce.The only descent dish we got was the beef and broccoli.  I do not recommend them."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Mesa!! Love the orange chicken, general tao's chicken, and hot & sour soup. We've been ordering the takeout for years."}
{"text":"It's a small Chinese Restaurant next to Bashas. I was out with some friends and we found a small restaurant. We ordered Walnut shrimp and egg foo young. The food was pretty good for its price and the staff was friendly. They even gave us free crab puffs.   They deliver which is cool because it's a good alternative than Pizza. It's a $20 minimum though."}
{"text":"Clean, clean, clean! Everything about this place was spotless. The food itself was perfectly adapted to suburban American tastes. Somehow even the Sweet & Sour chicken seemed.. extra clean. ::)"}
{"text":"Worst General Tso's Chicken EVER!!!  Mushy chicken, awful sauce!!  Had the worst stomache ache followed by explosive (you know what) 1 hour after eating it!!"}
{"text":"The good reviews for this place astound me. I live less than a minute away and love Chinese food, so I was really quite excited to find this place. Until, that is, I walked inside. First thing you should take note of is a \"B\" health rating posted on the wall. That, folks, is bad. I've worked in the restaurant business and let me tell you: A's are easy. Second, the food is mediocre at best. Sauces are not good, the meat quality is poor, and the meals are I'll prepared. Look elsewhere for good Chinese."}
{"text":"I ordered in and everyone was so nice. The lady in the phone was nice, the delivery guy was nice, if I was rating them on niceness they'd get a 4 or 5. The food was not so nice. The crab puffs were sweet and kind of odd tasting to me.  The chicken lo mein was bland and boring. I just can't imagine that I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"What I like best about J&M:  The \"healthy options\" that steams your vegetables and meat and gives you the sauce on the side.  \"Yang Chow Fried Rice\" the best fried rice I have ever eaten.  Wor Wonton Soup is fantastic when you're not feeling well...much better than your Jewish mama's chicken soup. The only disappointment?  I love egg foo young and their egg patties are perfect but they put a brown sauce on it instead of the more traditional gravy which just ruins it for me.  We get takeout here often and sometimes eat in.  The dinner specials are a great bargain with large portions that guarantee you'll get two meals out of it."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We first discovered this place just over a week ago and have been there several times since. The crab puffs are amazing. They are my favorite thing on the menu. We love all the food that we have tried so far. The fried rice isn't overly salty like it is at some other places. Also the sweet and soir chicken is mixed with the sauce, bit is still crispy. We have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for our food, even when we get it delivered. If you like Chinese I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a real jewel.  Very clean,quiet, and courteous.  It is not a buffet and the food is freshly prepared.  The prices are very reasonable. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We will go back."}
{"text":"I would give J and M a 3.5 star if possible.  They are very friendly every time I go there and they deliver which is really nice!  Their chicken chow fun is awesome, as is their sizzling rice soup, spring rolls, sesame chicken, and my favorite yang chow fried rice."}
{"text":"I like the General Tso Chicken & egg drop wonton soup. Really good lunch specials & great prices. It's nice and clean inside also."}
{"text":"We discovered J & M o the day we moved from Scottsdale to Mesa and have been there (and taken food home) dozens of times since. Delicious. Great service. Friendly. Fairly priced. We're lucky since it's less than a mile from our house. Favorite is J&M Special Pork. The best. Family owned and usually busy. As close to New York Chinese food as we've found in the Valley. There is another location in the West Valley that we suggested to our family and they said it was equally good."}
{"text":"Very rude staff and poor customer service. A few months ago we visited the restaurant to eat inside. We had to wait several hours to get food. The female owner could care less. Tonight we visited for take-out and didn't get our food as ordered. The female owner was very rude agai"}
