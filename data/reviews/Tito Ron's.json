{"text":"Tropical-Filipino tasting fare with a Western twist.  

Tito Ron's is not your traditional Filipino restaurant, it's a Filipino-fusion restaurant. 

Tito Ron plays with the tropical ingredients found in the archipelagos' of the Philippines to create a new and delightful dining experience which will very much intrigue the Western palate. I find this approach to be a unique twist on traditional Filipino food to which I am accustomed to as I'm Filipino myself. The menu of food gives a delightful sense of familiarity and novelty as Tito Ron recreates traditional Filipino dishes and assembles them into a new fashion. An example would be the ube rolls in which spring rolls are traditionally made to be a dinner dish, not as a dessert. Another example would have to be the shanghai burger sliders which normally are made into meat spring rolls, but in this case, burgers. 

Tito Ron's is definitely worth checking out if you happen to find yourself craving the flavours of the tropics."}
{"text":"Hello Lumpia Lovers, or, if you're not yet one, then Hello Soon-To-Be Lumpia Lovers!

Tito Ron's is this new place Filipino-Carribean place in Kensington Market in the same space where Panchos Bakery is located. They opened this spot after getting funded thru a successful KickStarter.

Pork Tocino on Rice ($7) - very delicious cured pork but they twisted it by having a hint of pineapple flavour that worked really well so you get the sweetness from the cured pork plus the tangy from the pineapple.

Beef Bistek on Rice ($7) - actually this didn't remind me of the usual filipino bistek, but I still liked it. It actually reminded me more of the beef from gyudon (specifically Yoshinoya in the Philippines).

Ube Plantain Turon ($5) - these are dessert spring rolls with plantain and ube inside. These turons (dessert spring rolls) bring me back home. Love the mix of ube inside, something interestingly unique and delicious. The Tito Ron's homemade plantain chip crumble adds an extra crunchy oomf to the turon. Sarap! Wish they were bigger per piece though like actual turons back home.

Overall, I like their offerings and the food. However, I'm not sure if the price justifies what you're getting. The $5 turons were 6 small pieces where right beside it is Panchos Bakery with $5 for 3 big churros. The $7 rice dish wasn't that big too. You get maybe 5 pcs of pork tocino on a cup of rice. I definitely won't get full if I just ordered 1 of the $7 rice item."}
{"text":"So far I've only tried the Beef Patty rolls here and they were great!
The latest in this coveted spot in Gordo's in Kensington (behind the churro stand), Tito Ron's rocks the joint with interesting Filipino/Toronto fusion snacks. Fried spam? They got it! I'll have to try that next as who doesn't like pork products re-invented in interesting dishes like what Tito is pushing. Welcome Tito Ron's, we've been waiting for you!"}
{"text":"authentic with a touch of fusion. will come back for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT! 

Ube and jackfruit gelato topped with ube lumpia and ube crackers = YUM!! Located in Kensington Market, this is yet another awesome cultural dessert that the Toronto scene has been blessed with. Despite competing gelato stores nearby, I really feel that this place stands out because of its unique offerings of authentic Filipino flavors. Cold and refreshing, Tito Ron's gelato will definitely be a hit this summer for hot days!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Kensington Market on a Sunday to get some meats and cheese and some produce. But we could have gotten that anywhere. We really drove the murderous trek from York to downtown (murderous as in I want to murder every Toronto driver out on the road) to give Tito Ron's a try. In typical fashion, my Canadian (read: white) girlfriend found and told me about this place.

The place is tucked with other small food places in the heart of Kensington. We were greeted by two friendly couple who I believe we're the owners. They have somewhat small equipment to churn out food at such a small space but the food that came out was worth the trip. We ordered Tocino (cured pork) sliders, lumpia (spring rolls) with jerked beef (Filipino-Carribean inspired), and ube (purple yam) and jackfruit ice cream with turon (sweet spring rolls) with ube inside topped with crushed plantains. The tocino was made by them from scratch and not the store bought kind which was truly amazing. The lumpia was also good but it was definitely dwarfed by the sliders. The ice cream was also one of the best ube and jackfruit ice cream I've had Ina long time. If this was the store bought kind, then I imagined they bought either Magnolia or Sorbetes brand because it definitely reminded me of those two brands, which to say, is forgivable and I won't hold that against them. But if this was made from scratch?...then holy crap it's the best ube/jackfruit ice cream ever because it reminded me of the ice cream I had as a child!

I also have to extend my compliment to the couple that was there serving us. They were absolutely friendly and even when they got a barrage of customers, they were still smiling from ear to ear and took the time to say goodbye to us as we were leaving. They even recommended a book for us to read to get their inspiration for their dishes.

I sincerely hope these guys move to a bigger location and perhaps their own shop. It's good food and good service. And I highly recommended."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Heard great things about their pies and was excited for them to a pop up in the north end of town. Got the coconut caramel polvoron pie. It was absolutely not what we were anticipating. It was soooooooooo sweet. Think pecan pie x100. The polvoron crust did not taste like polvoron at all..and had a metallic taste bc of the metal container it came in. It was coconut jam with an excess amount of caramel/sugar. Not appetizing at all. Very disappointed.  Will definitely not be recommending their products... blech."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Kensington market for Pedestrian Sunday and were looking forward to trying Tito Ron's. They had mini empanadas, barbecue skewers, and ice cream sundaes. 

We tried their Sarsi pork (Sarsi is a root beer type soft drink popular in the Philippines and other parts of Asia). Unlike many other Filipino barbecue skewers, this was very meaty and not overly charred. This was the only savoury food my niece was interested in eating at the market, so we even came back a second time for another pork skewer and to try their sundae and empanadas. Their empanadas ($0.50 each) were 1-2 bite sized and had a slightly sweet dough surrounding the meat and vegetable filling. 

The sundae was quite unique in that it came with two mini turons (spring rolls filled with sweet filling; in this case purple yam or ube). The turons, mini ube pillow-shaped cookies, and crushed banana chips provide a great textural contrast with the ice cream. Unfortunately they ran out of ube ice cream by the time we ordered but they replaced this with mango and queso ice creams which suited me just fine.

As a proud Filipina, it warms my heart when I see Filipino food elevated and in demand. Thank goodness for Tito Ron's and similar businesses who bring Filipino food to the forefront and make it accessible and sought after."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try in Kensington Market! 

Always end up going back for their Turon Sundae. You have the option of choosing from different Magnolia ice cream flavours, which are topped with a mango condensed milk sauce, pieces of plantain chips, ube crackers, and of course pieces of turon filled with ube inside. The flavours definitely come together and are especially great on hot summer days!

Went here 3 times already and each time the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming!! Always ready to start a conversation with you & try to serve you as efficiently as possible."}
{"text":"It's a tiny spot they have carved out for themselves in Kensington Market but it's somewhat hidden away in this mini eatery market on Augusta.

First off, customer service here is spot on. Friendly and helpful staff. That my friends, is almost a 5 star rating.

I've noticed a lot of accolades for the dessert and it is definitely the season for it but I like a meal. It tells me more about their culinary profile.

You ask, why the 3? Actually, I would even say 2 for the dish I had a chance to try that day, the Adobo Pork with rice. Although the flavour could use a little boost, the meat I was portioned out was disappointing because it was a little bit of pork then tendons. Chewy, icky tendons that you cannot eat. That was a terrible waste of money. The rice was fine but the main course had one edible piece and the remaining pieces, I chewed on tendons I had to spit out.

The lumpia fusion flavour of beef patty was not bad at all. Still a little shy of flavouring but they were soooooo skinny. I would have preferred to 2 bigger pieces for the price so I could appreciate the filling. That would be a great option. It's just so freaking tiny with so little filling.
The stellar part of it was, how well rolled and crispy it was.

In respect, to the food, I am happy to see Filipino cuisine in the market but it still has room to grow. It's not my favourite in the city but I am glad to have tried it."}
{"text":"It was a muggy 28C out when we walked in to the space Tito Ron's shares with a few other vendors and I immediately wanted to go back outside where it was cooler. But first I had to fortify myself with an ube turon sundae (you've seen the pictures). Mango and coconut ice cream drizzled w/ mango condensed milk, ube cookies, banana crumble and turon are a delicious and different combination that didn't leave me feeling sluggish and ashamed of myself. Well worth a return visit or ten."}
{"text":"I grew up on FIlipino food, so when this place opened up in Kensington Market, I knew I had to drop by and visit. Tito Ron's is Filipino food with a twist - Filipino-Caribbean fusion, unique, with a menu offering a number of sweet and savoury options (check their website to see what they're offering that day). In short, I loved it. 

Located in a building that houses a group of food stalls (the same one that has Pancho's Bakery for churros), we dropped by on a Friday evening after dinner to pick up something sweet for dessert. We ordered a tray of Ube Spring Rolls (4 pieces). For those unfamiliar, Ube is a form of purple yam that's sweet and often used in Filipino desserts. The spring rolls were topped with a mix of mango condensed milk and crispy bits of plantain chips. We absolutely loved it - it was sweet, crunchy, with various textures and made for a really enjoyable after-meal treat.

Tito Ron's recently opened a couple of weeks ago, and they have great variety to their menu. On top of sweet spring rolls, they also have savoury spring rolls (stuffed with jerk chicken, channa, etc.), and actual meal offerings (\"ulam\") like tocino, spam, lechon, etc. Looking forward to trying out the rest of their menu!

For a tray of 4 pieces of Ube Spring Rolls, we paid $5.00. There's seating at the back of the unit to enjoy your meal. Also, tip: they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this place! Kensington's Tito Ron's is under the same roof as Pancho's Churros - just behind it in fact when you get in through the entrance. I got the shanghai sliders and the sundae that's been featured in Blog TO. The $7 shanghai sliders basically taste like the inside of lumpia shanghai rolls (Filipino fried spring rolls) but in slider form. This was good but not amazing. I might be biased though because I prefer the taste of my mom's homemade spring rolls. The sundae for $7 was a bit pricey in my opinion but I really wanted to try it. My husband chose the ube (taro) ice cream and buko ice cream as the two flavours and it was topped with taro cookies, plantain chip bits and fried taro rolls. A refreshing treat to finish off the sliders for sure and it did taste good but I think it bugs me that I can buy a small tub of ube ice cream (which would be several scoops of ice cream) for less than $7. Anyway, I know that's not the whole point of buying these sundaes. I definitely want to come back another time though to try some of the other food that had sold out by the time we got there. Definite potential here!"}
{"text":"COST:
~$5 (Ube and Buko Pandan Sundae)
~$7 (Tocino Sliders)
~$5 (Lumpia Beef)

I put the prices as estimates since I don't really know exactly what the Canadian prices translate into USD, so I just typed them in USD.

It's taken me a long time to write this review since I really do appreciate the effort of bringing Filipino food to the masses, but in all honesty, the food was just not good. It sucks to be giving the place two stars since the staff and the owner were way too nice... however the food is simply lacking.

The ice cream sundae was definitely the highlight for me. The flavors were good but it's just Magnolia Ice Cream flavors decorated with the Ube Pillows crackers and some cereal on top. The ube spring rolls were good but it didn't have enough ube inside it to really bring it home.

The tocino sliders were decent. Again, nothing to write home about. That brings us to the beef lumpia... it's probably what I have a problem with the most.

I kid you not, the filling on the lumpia was basically pureed beef, if you can even call it that. Think Jack In The Box $1 \"beef\" tacos. It's just basically inedible goo. It's a damn shame that people who've never tried true lumpia will have these as their first experience.

Hopefully they improve as they become bigger, but other than the delightful staff, this was sadly a complete let down. Sorry."}
{"text":"Fun, informal and fast. Opted for the Tocino pork slider, fried Spam slider and some lumpia for dessert. Everything was tasty, quick and cheap. Exactly what you'd hope for in street-food inspired Filipino fare."}
{"text":"Tito Ron's has been operating since May 2015, and in a short period, they became an established food vendor at several summer food festivals. My first encounter with their lumpia dessert was at the inaugural Sweetery Toronto last summer. At that event, I got to enjoy their deep-fried coconut bae lumpia. Tito Ron's has now expanded their business into an actual storefront where people can enjoy a well crafted menu of Filipino-Caribbean dishes. They recently acquired a space in the food court at 214 Augusta Avenue in Kensington Market through a successful Kickstarter campaign. The restaurant opened earlier this March with great fanfare, and they have been selling out of lumpias on several occasions since their opening.

Tito Ron's offers Filipino cuisine with Caribbean influences to their food. There are several ingredients and methods of cooking that are relatively common between the two cuisine, so they incorporate well together. Some commonly used ingredients that both cuisine use include pineapples, coconuts, cassava, tamarind and plantains. Many of the these ingredients are prominently used at Tito Ron's. Their menu offers a great number of sweet and savory options of Filipino-Caribbean fusion dishes at affordable prices. 

The first dish that we sampled was the Jerk Chicken Adobo Lumpia - fresh chicken thighs are marinated in Jerk Seasoning and then cooked in Filipino Adobo sauce, wrapped in a spring roll pastry and deep fried until golden brown. Served topped with our tropical hot sauce (pickled papaya, pineapple, scotch bonnet) and achara (pickled pineapple slaw). Philippine adobo is a popular dish in Philippine cuisine, and is often associated as the \"unofficial national dish\". So, it was only natural to create a lumpia using the adobo method of cooking. The saltiness of the adobo sauce complements the spice of the jerk chicken well making it a formidable combination.

Another fusion lumpia roll is the Channa Lumpia - Channa, a chickpea mixture cooked in Caribbean curry, is rolled into a lumpia and deep fried until golden brown. Served topped with our sweet tamarind bbq sauce and achara. This particular lumpia roll is both veterinarian and vegan-friendly.

One of the rice dishes offered at Tito Ron's is the Lechon Kawali - Filipino fried pork belly. Fresh pork belly with skin, salt cured in house and fried crispy to order. Served with salted tomatoes and white rice and topped with extra crispy fried pig skin. The portion that we received was sample size, as the full dish contained a lot more fried pork belly. Personally, I enjoyed the crispiness of the cured pork, as they double fry the skin to ensure that the texture is extra crispy. 

The Tocino - Filipino sweet cured pork. Ours is made from fresh pork shoulder sliced thin and marinated for days in a mixture of sweet, salty and savoury elements before being fried hot to order. Served on rice or on sliders (on a Caribbean Tennis Roll) with salted tomatoes and our Pinoy Max Sauce (Garlic Aioli, Banana Ketchup, Achara Relish) was a favorite among the bloggers. The cured pork had a sweet hint of pineapple, which greatly added to the flavor profile. 

I am a huge fan of Tito Ron's dessert spring rolls (lumpia), as they're not overly sweet. The first dessert that we tried was the Purple Plantain Lumpia - Ube Halaya filled dessert lumpia. Topped with Mango Condensed milk drizzle and plantain chip butter crumble. Traditionally, this is a popular snack food among Filipinos, and is often filled with different fruit filling. However, Tito Ron's has provided a more creative take on it by topping it with plantain chip butter crumble.
