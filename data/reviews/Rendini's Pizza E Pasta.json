{"text":"Went on a week night and since most of inside seating was taken, we sat in the small outdoor dining area since we had 2 small children with us. We ate here over a year ago and food and service was very good, but not on this visit. The service was very slow. It took someone over 3 minutes to acknowledge us as we stood at the door. Once we sat down, it was another 4 minutes before the waitress came and took our drink order. Our drinks arrived 5 minutes later. How long does it take to bring lemonade and tea? We observed 2 adult couples who sat outside with us who arrived 5 minutes after us and their entrees arrived 5 minutes before ours?! The food was pretty good but it was the only bright spot of the evening."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had the Fettuccine Alfredo and pizza. The Fettuccine Alfredo's sauce was watered down. It wasn't creamy and was very, very bland. The pizza was alright but not memorable at all and I wouldn't make a trip back to have it again, which is fairly telling as I live about a minute away. Cute little place with pleasant staff but the food doesn't match up."}
{"text":"This review is for Saturday Night June 25th 2011  A-OK? or more like BARELY three Stars - I feel generous giving three stars!  I have experienced better Italian, though it has been a while since it was a lot better - I Love Great Italian food and wish we had some around our region!  Fresh pasta is Great, freshly baked bread and fantastic dessert, though all I really want is Fantastic Sauce and Salad Dressing that makes me want to lick the plate!   The Hostess was very friendly and polite, the Manager (I'm guessing a lady not dressed like everyone else, she was the only one wearing color) was very polite and friendly.  My waitress was friendly and sweet and seemed to know the food!  She said there was a new cook.  The Men's washroom was neat and clean!  This is not an easy review to write!  Up to this point my visit to Waxhaw surpassed my expectations!  On one hand I have reviewed and deleted more Italian restaurants than any other cuisines - this food for our area was about average from  what I have experienced so far.   The Run down on the food - If you see my photos you may think it looks pretty good and compared to most Italian places in a 75 mile radius, I guess it was."}
