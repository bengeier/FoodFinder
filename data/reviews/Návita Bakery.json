{"text":"Almost every weekend, on our way to visit my in-laws, we take the longer way just to stop here for the sugar donuts and the custard tarts. These are the only things I get here. The donuts are huge, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is not very sweet and quite addictive! We used to buy like 6 for ourselves but being deep fried dough, i imagine it can't be too good for you. *sad face* there is a version with bits of carrot in it. I will try that one next time.  The custard tart is delicious as well. The custard is sweet and the shell is nice a flaky. I love the ones that are a bit charred on top.   Around $8.50 for three large donuts and two custard tarts! Pretty good!   There is lots of seating available with a coffee bar and two rooms with tables. They serve breakfast from 7 am. I haven't tried it, so I can't comment. The patrons eating in are mostly seniors"}
{"text":"Was not too impressed with this bakery. I went at around 11:15 in the morning and there was a lack of pastries in the display. What they had seemed not as fresh as I'd like - the tiramisu had a yellow hard skin and when they picked it up with the tongs it was stuck on to the marble display. The hot food was ok - ordered the chicken scallopini and pasta and for $7.99+taxes I'd expect a bit more than a take out box that was half the size in height than most other traditional take out foam boxes. Too bad , it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Bakery, Pasticceria, Trattoria as another one like Nino D'aversa style that I've encountered before.  This one however is not at any noticeable major intersection therefore it's more for the locals that live around after dropping off their children at the nearby Public School.  The environment and seating give off a slightly Goth and historic European feel.  Offerings of Oven Pizza, a good selection of Pastries and individual CAKES, Breads and Pies.  There's Hot Table, Cold Cuts and even a small selection Grocery Fridge.  Good additional option when you want to get away from the crowd and enjoy a Coffee Beverage in this calm quiet neighbourhood.  Btw, Vaughan's current Mayor has setup shop within this plaza as well."}
{"text":"I really like Novita, I am a big fan of their pastas which are sometimes sold out. Vaughan does pasta well, I can't find a hot table this good in Brampton. The prices are a little high, it's over $9 for a plate of pasta, sauce, and mushrooms from the hot table but the pasta is always very good. Penne a la vodka is my favourite. I go here often to pick up lunch or dinner when there is pasta available."}
{"text":"good pastries and not so friendly service a bit expensive and not as fresh as i would like it to be"}
{"text":"We tried this place out right in the middle of the holiday seasons. Of all the bakeries we've frequented in the area, this by far leaves very little to be desired.  The decor looks good, and there is a private party room as well.  But the space has a lot of echo and is so loud in here that you cannot possibly sit and enjoy your meal or your coffee.   The cappuccino was great but the desserts were dry, and tasted stale. It was right around Christmas time and the store was packed - how could your food be stale? Also I didn't appreciate being followed around and asked ten times if I wanted anything else. Clearly if I'm still looking as you are packing I'm looking to order more items!! I eventually gave up after getting them to pack just 4 pastries and got my other 3 boxes elsewhere..there's only so much bad service one can ignore.  Additionally, the parking is a mess especially during winters and very hard to even land a spot!  I fail to see the appeal. Definitely won't be returning...."}
{"text":"To accommodate the newly added pizzeria they did some shuffling of shelves and reorganizing of placements so I felt a bit lost when I first walked in.    They still have the usual crowd sitting outside smoking and drinking their coffee.   Although in my most recent visit the service was moderately better the canolli shells were soggy, the flavor was underwhelming I also tried a caramel topped mousse which was just ok, I don't know how long they leave their pasties, but they have a lot of competition in this area and are becoming less impressive with every visit unfortunately."}
