{"text":"We used a Groupon to try this place out and were very pleased with the whole experience. The restaurant is situated in a quiet strip mall that doesn't do the cuisine justice. The interior featured surpisingly elegant decor, a solid bar and flat screen TVs.  This was some of the best Persian food I've had in the valley. My boyfriend, who doesn't normally like dolmades (dolmeh), devoured one happily - so flavourful.  Besides the dolmeh, we selected 3 appetizer samplers, a silky eggplant dish, torshi  (uniquely pickled vegetables WOW!), and a balanced hummus, all served with warm fluffy pita.  My entree was a hearty portion of rice and the most tender lamb kebab I've ever had, along with grilled vegetables. My boyfriend had the lamb shank served with mixed wild rice and Fava beans - the star was a delicate au jus spiked with cinnamon for dipping. Out of this world!  As full as we were, we couldn't help eating with our eyeballs the heaping gyros that the couple next to us ordered.  The staff/owner were welcoming and friendly. We look forward to returning on a weekend to enjoy some live entertainment/dancing!"}
{"text":"The meal was excellent and fresh serice was superb and atmosphere was good. Went there 3 times since they open in Dec 1st 2015. Took a couples with me last time they were very much pleased.  All meat entre was perfectly marinated and tender.  It is 9 out of 10 for house was little cold."}
{"text":"I went here recently with h my wife and a friend. The owner's brother was our server. He was extremely friendly and professional.   We ordered kababs and lamb skewers and the egg plant dish.   Everything was perfectly delicious.   We fnished the meal with hot teas and pastry. Wow.   The owner came out and greeted us. Such a nice man.   1001 is closer to my home than other Persian restaurants so this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Persian restaurant! Beyond flavorful and delicious. Also, very hospitable service, and elegant setting. They also have belly dancers on Friday and Saturday nights! We will be back, and back often. Excited to have another excellent local restaurant in the Fiesta District!"}
{"text":"1001 Night Lounge Is probably my favorite place, If Your going To this Resturan is one the best place. They've got the best hookas with the best prices, they've got the warm outdoors and the best house mixed with cup of tea"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night recently at 6pm and there was not another single soul eating there the whole time we were there.   We had a restaurant.com certificate which brought us there only to find out when we went to pay that they don't accept them anymore.  Food was good but the ambiance was strange being the only ones eating there."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service was the worst. Could not get anyone to help us, we were the ONLY customers there and it took forever to get our food. Really really wanted to like this place. Also, one of the tvs was featuring dental surgery until we asked to change it. : ("}
{"text":"Okay food, Very bad service. There is a belly dancer from 8 to 8:30 Fridays and Saturdays that was the only highlight of our visit to this place."}
{"text":"Decent food, the barg ws medium, koobideh was good, I also enjoyed the basmati rice"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this converted chow hall. Prices were very high.  Food was very mediocre.  We battled gnats on our dishes at our table.  I could get into detail about each dish that we ordered but I'd rather just say the following.  The prices were 4 star restaurant level. The food was 2 star level. The location is 1 star level.  The huge dining room resembled a prison dining hall in my opinion.  The service was acceptable but not exemplary.  Major disrespect to the Greek salad which was 98% iceberg lettuce.  And again, the gnats were disgusting at our table and walking around our dishes.  Not a chance we'd return."}
{"text":"Best Persian food I have had in a very long time. Definitely tasted like home made food.  Amazing service. We had fun dancing and singing along with the music. The owner was very nice and pleasant.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, but a bit hesitant when I saw that there was a new Persian restaurant in the East Valley (we usually have to drive to North Scottsdale). When I walked in I instantly noticed how clean and well decorated the restaurant was and how nicely we were greeted at the door. The food came out fairly quickly- we ordered the Sultani. The rice was great, as was the koobideh and barg. Both beef skewers were cooked well and the barg was extremely tender. The owner was also very kind and down-to-earth. We will definitely be coming back again. Looks like we won't be needing to drive too far for Persian food!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food here was AMAZING!  My husband and I enjoy Mediterranean food, so have tried several places.  This might be our new favorite!  The meats were all juicy and perfectly seasoned - oh so tasty!  Chef Mike was a delight, and we look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Been here three times. The Chef's Special is really good. We love the hummus and make sure to order it every time as an appetizer. Food comes out quickly and the portions are generous. I especially enjoyed the bellydance night (last Wednesday of the month), there were a lot of really good, very talented bellydancers from the local BD community.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Such delicious food!!! Visited from California and came across this restaurant. Tastes homemade...absolutely delicious! And the owner is so sweet! Hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Great chicken koobideh!!!!!! So delicious! Definitely will be back love this place. Chef is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Did we hit this place on a bad night?  After the reviews, maybe I went with exceedingly high expectations.  We had a Groupon so off we went.  I have been to a few Persian restaurants in my time - and this one didn't do much of anything for me.  We started with a Greek salad since neither of ours entrees came with a salad (I am not sure where the 1/2 and 1/2 option was but it was not on the menu, nor was it suggested to us).  It was a predictable salad but - wait for it - it came without dressing.  Really? How do you miss that in the prep.  And did the server not even look at it? So I had to walk back to the kitchen and flag someone down to get dressing (as she was nowhere to be found).  Now, in a non-chain restaurant, I generally love the salad dressings.  Always fresh and light.  I expected a Greek-style dressing on a Greek salad - some EVOO, some red wine vinegar or lemon.  What I didn't expect was what they put on it.  Whether it was their version of a Persian dressing with sumac, I am not sure - I didn't taste any lemon or anything I remembered. It almost tasted like Italian to me.  My DH ordered the gyro dinner and I ordered the chicken barg.  The portions were large.  Gyro? frankly, nothing exciting there. it is what it is.  The chicken was plentiful and nicely presented, it was just - boring.  I expected it to have a tangier taste from the yogurt which didn't even seem to be there.  it was just yellow from the saffron.  The basmati rice was simply steamed with some saffron.  It was traditional and met expectations (note to reviewers:  this is not like rice pilaf so don't come expecting the more traditional pilaf you might have at other restaurants).  The last part of our dinner was the bread.  That was kind of disappointing. I was expecting a thicker, more naan-like bread.  This was so thin and microwaved so it was actually tough. It was plentiful - they kept the basket full - but oddly enough it was served with butter.  Okay. to me, that is just different.   2 dinners (one gyro, one barg), 1 salad, 2 sodas:  $45 plus tax and tip.  It wasn't terrible. It just wasn't great either. Decor is interesting - sort of Persian disco?  Obviously newly opened and kind of stark except for the changing lights over the bar that mesmerized me (like a moth to a light, DH says). I think we will appreciate our fav Persian restaurant a bit more these days.  Oh and interestingly enough.  There was one couple there before us. And us.  And a guy came in after us to order takeout.  Who got served first? Yep. The takeout.  Chef:  dude.  Pay attention. You are new to the business.  He walked out with two bags of food while we sat and watched.  It took over an hour from start to finish.  Imagine a busy night???  Scorecard: Quality:  2.5 stars Price:  3 stars Service : 3 stars  Cleanliness: 5 stars"}
{"text":"Got a groupon.  I love Fresh Persian food and said why not!  Not disappointed.  Had the Beef three way.  Veggies roasted just right.  Finished dinner with some Persian ice cream .  Generous serving.  We came at lunch very quiet time. Want to come back for Midnight Buffet night and eat and dance.  Mike, the owner, was friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. I ordered the lunch portion of the beef koobideh. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"It's been years since I had Persian food regardless the food was awesome.   I chose the app sampler and steak sampler.  I will eat for days.  It was all freshly cooked and very tasty. It's 5 min away I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Persian food, you can't go wrong with koobideh. Also, I talked to the owner about entertainment and he said Friday's they have karaoke, but the last Friday of every month they have belly dancers. He also said this coming weekend they will be celebrating the Persian New Year with a Persian singer and a full course dinner, and you can reserve a spot beforehand by calling and purchasing a ticket."}
{"text":"I know a thing or two about Persian food and this place is not the place to go for it.  Service is horrible, food takes too long and the lack of communication between the staff will make this place a prime local for Chef Ramsey's kitchen nightmares.  The service was not only slow but it seemed like the staff were not even trained on how to serve drinks without holding the top edge of the glasses.  We were told they ran out of a Persian Salad called Shirazi while it's supposed to be common Persian appetizer and it was only 6:30 pm.  The waiter never said let me see what we can put together or something of the sort either. Akin to going to a Seafood place and hearing that they are out of fish half an hour into the service. Then they served the food with the rice being hot but the meat was as cold as stone. I will give them 6 months to a year if they don't start changing their ways immediately."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food. I had never had Persian food before but am now a fan! Not a whole lot of vegetarian options but the falafel was really the best I ever had. They also do belly dancing on weekends with a dj until 1am. I am definitely coming back here and will recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"We like Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food.  This place is one of the better places to get Persian (Middle Eastern) food.  We went for lunch today and they were busy preparing for a big party that night.  But they were kind enough to accommodate us and serve us.  We began by sharing a big Greek salad that was good.  My GF ordered the chicken breast kabob with rice and pita bread, and I had the gyros plate with rice and pita bread.  I also added a skewer of koobideh for an extra charge.  The food was good and the portions were generous.  We are fans and will be go back again."}
{"text":"I did a pick up order. I really wanted to love this place since I love Persian food. The older gentleman that greeted me was wonderful. However, the place was virtually empty save a table of about 6 people. It was also very quiet. No music playing or anything. I only had to wait a few minutes for my food, which was great. Unfortunately the food itself was bland. It was a huge portion of basmati rice which was pretty much tasteless, chicken kabob and beef kobideh. The beef and chicken could have used some more spice, for sure.  They just tasted...blah. Not great, not terrible. It's definitely overpriced for the quality of food you get. It was my first time here, and I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Tried out what we thought would be a great restaurant based on the menu using Groupon. Owner and staff are rude. They changed multiple requirements from the original purchase details. For example, they made us buy two larger dinner portions so that we had to spend $11 more than the Groupon cost. They even told us this was so that they would make more money. They made us feel unwelcome the whole visit. It was a completely negative experience. We will never come back and will not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"There was a sign on the front door asking that you mention your Groupon before ordering so we did.  The gentleman immediately marked it redeemed and left us with menus.  After 6 minutes he came to take our order, we were not yet ready and I asked for water.  He seemed irritated, but left again and then disappeared in back for 5 minutes, the place was empty and my friend and I felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome.  We decided that we did not want to be there any longer, nor eat anything there.  It was a very unsettling atmosphere, which is unfortunate because it is beautiful inside and the menu looked lovely.  We exited and went down the road to Green Corner which is consistently good and welcoming.  We really felt that our business was not appreciated because we had a Groupon which is unfortunate, because having spent decades in the service industry, we use all the money we save to leave amazing tips for our servers .  So very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"I Like the atmosphere . Food is great too. Saturday nights they have DJ and belly dance."}
{"text":"First we're Persian food fans, with a couple of people in my party being native Persians, so tough crowd to please. I, like many, bought the Groupon which I'll admit sometimes leads to lower expectations. We were pleasantly surprised. The service was good, they're a little young and green so be prepared but they do have the desire to please which is refreshing. We ordered the three beef and three chicken dishes. Overall the chicken dish which came with three different chicken selections, two huge plates of rice and roasted veggies was our favorite. The beef was average but well portioned. We were also delighted with the \"cute\" belly dancer. She had energy, got our daughters into the mix and made it more than a dinner but an experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The best hookah lounge in Mesa Good house mixes with amazing prices  Love going here They also serve food and alcoholic drinks U should go there"}
{"text":"The food here was great!  We ordered the Chef's Sample, and everything in it was really good.  My favorite was the chicken (really tender and not dry) and the beef koobideh. The entree also came with pita bread.  The restaurant owner was nice and even treated us with a free dessert.  The interior of the restaurant was nice and I would recommend this place if you're looking for Persian food."}
{"text":"All I can say that the food was very very delicious! And the staff were really really nice. Nice place to go and eat I love the atmosphere and they were playing Iranian music....Which is amazing! Great idea!! I would totally go back and next time I will take all my family there! Great place and great food!"}
{"text":"Went last night to try this place after reading so many good reviews. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. When we first walked in the place was empty and it had a strong funky smell. We decided to order takeout instead. When they brought our food the cook messes up the orders and instead of making a sandwich gave us a chicken kebab platter. He offered to fix if but we said it was ok. Instead of charging for the sandwich the charged us for the platter and charged the wrong food to the wrong cards. When we went back to the hotel we had no forks or pita for the hummus we ordered. The chicken was overcooked it only tasted like pepper and the onions on the kebabs were burnt. Really disappointing especially because the restaurant was empty!"}
{"text":"The food is one of the best Iranian I have tried in town... it is actually underrated and would love to invite my friends over."}
{"text":"I ordered food for my party of 22 people last week.  I was worried I hadn't ordered enough food but the owner reassured me that the food was going to be enough which it was but most important the food was delicious!!  I  ordered two entrees and an appetizer for the party.  Everybody loved the food!  Thank you so much. We will be ordering from you again."}
{"text":"Apparently they decide to change their hours without notifying/posting a change to their hours........"}
{"text":"My second time back in a week for lunch!  The koobideh pita sandwich is fantastic!  Try the saffron ice cream also.  So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! We started off with humus, dolmas and eggplant appetizers. The humus was absolutely the best-- creamy and flavorful and the dolmas were exceptional.  My husband loved the eggplant dish and he doesn't like eggplant.  Then we shared beef, chicken and lamb kabobs that were the succulent and juicy and went well with the saffron rice.. Dessert you must try saffron, rose water and pistachio ice cream made in house."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5 stars Entertainment (belly dancer): 5 stars Service: 2 stars (generous)  There were 10 people in the restaurant when we arrived. Apparently they were short on menus.  14-top sat after us: game over, the servers did not work together.  Pita bread that was supposed to come with entree, didn't come until it was requested twice, and I was done eating. Tea refill requested twice, never came.   Lamb/gyro plate was good, even without pita.  If the place is 1/2-full, they can't handle."}
{"text":"Great new Persian Restaurant tucked away but worth finding!  Lamb kabob (Barg) was very tender and tasty.  Ground beef and chicken kabobs were also fabulous.  Perfect rice, fresh salad and a wonderful chopped salad, Shirazi, very refreshing."}
{"text":"I decided we should go check out this new Persian restaurant that opened up in Mesa. Looked pretty inexpensive, ratings were good, and Persian food is bomb  so I thought why not go?  We walk in and it's DEAD. Not only is there no one sitting at any of the tables, but it's DEAD quiet. No music going or anything. Someone comes out and I ask him if they're open for dinner. He says that they are, but informs me that their buffet starts at 9pm (we arrived at 7pm). I wasn't even aware that this place did a buffet, as their website and Facebook page made no mention of this. Well, we were already there, so might as well get a table and give it a chance.  We pick a table and the same guy is apparently also our waiter.....but a horrible one. Not a rude one, by any means, but severely untrained. And now that I think about it, I believe that was the reason he mentioned the buffet to us.....this guy was probably only hired to pick up plates and clean tables during the buffet. He couldn't take orders without writing down the entire name of the entrée and repeating them back to us (which took forever), he couldn't pronounce certain names properly (like he pronounced the T on the end of Merlot and Cabernet), my boyfriend asked for a drink WITH his dinner and got it like 15 minutes BEFORE our dinner arrived, I was asked if I wanted a refill on my wine, and instead of waiting for me to finish what I had in my glass, he immediately took it from me to refill it, so I ended up not getting my money's worth on the wine.....pretty chaotic.  I know, it sounds like I'm being harsh, but that's not all! About ten minutes after we sit down, a DJ comes in to start playing some Persian music. Cool, it's not going to be dead quiet in here anymore. NO, INSTEAD IT GOT REALLY LOUD REALLY FAST. We literally went from whispering to shouting within a matter of seconds. I mean, when you've got only four guests in the entire restaurant, I feel like that's something you DON'T want to do. Not only that, but the volume level kept shifting up and down every few minutes, mid-song.....so sometimes the music would be kind of loud, sometimes it would be super loud, without warning, no rhyme or reason whatsoever.  Inexperienced waiter, inexperienced DJ, weird experience. The food was alright. Not great, but not bad either. Definitely not worth the awkward experience, though."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so flavorful! Definitely try their kubbideh and rice entree! Their appetizers are also on point!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today and it was a very pleasant experience.  Had the Kubideh, it was delicious and service was amazing too.  Very authentic Persian place..."}
{"text":"A very unexpected experience starting from the entrance to the end of the night. When you roll up to the parking lot, it'll be fairly empty and dark except for the flashy lights at the entrance of the restaurant. Let's not forget the neon sign advertising pho adjacent to the entrance door despite this being a Persian restaurant (this will make sense in a minute).   Upon entering, the place was empty except for a guy holding a mic with 3 of his friends. We assumed it was a private event going on but there was no staff in sight to confirm this. We walked over to the bar area looking for a worker until we were greeted with presumably the owner.. who appeared to be Vietnamese. Aha now the sign kinda maybe made sense..? Still very confused by a Persian restaurant selling pho but okay...  She stated it wasn't a private event and we could sit wherever we'd like so we sat at the farthest possible table to avoid the private party of 4. Eventually the man with the mic began his  performance (a fusion of dark stand up comedy and keyboard playing).  It was loud, uncomfortable, and just weird overall. Not to mention we didn't ask for this nor expect a performance.   Finally we get our food (beef koobideh with rice). The rice was delish and the koobideh showed promise except for the fact that it was seasoned with a pound or two of salt. The bread appetizer was basic pita. It was overall a disappointing dish. If the salt didn't overpower, I think it would have been a great dish.   As for the service, the owner and waiter were nice and courteous. I just wish we had a better dining experience as not only was the food not great, but the atmosphere was off. It was so uncomfortable that we left before smoking hookah--which was part of the reason we visited this place first off. We wanted to do dinner followed by hookah w/o having to drive to a separate place. This didn't work out but fortunately there are hookah places nearby."}
{"text":"went on a Friday night as a group for a friends birthday, what a place!! we had the place to ourselves.. we were brought appetizers of an eggplant dish and some hummus.. I am not a fan of hummus and this was as flavorful and seasoned so well I really enjoyed it. the eggplant was a hit with everyone  our platters of meats.. chicken beef and a ground beef mixture were delicious.. tender juicy and superbly flavored. Service was attentive and the belly dancer was fun and kept everyone involved!  kudos to a fun place and an excellent meal!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice is the Super freindly staff. They really make you feel like a guest in their home, which is true Persian hospitality. Very clean restaurant with an elegant flare. Easy to navigate and well laid out menu allows for minimal confusion and good descriptions of the different dishes. I had the kashke bademjan for an appetizer which was enough for 5 people! It was very tasty with the pita bread. For an entrée I had the sultani meal with an extra chef special chicken kabob skewer. It came with rice and salad. The kabobs were some of the best I have ever had. Super tender, juicy and flavorful. All the meat is ground/pounded/and skewered to order making it that much better.  The owner came out afterwards and offered me a very warm welcome to his restaurant and offered me some dessert and Persian chai. The homemade saffron ice cream was great! He was telling me about the belly dancers that entertain the diners on weekends and that the comedian Maz Jobrani is going to be making an appearance there soon which is very cool! The bill was actually a lot less than I expected compared to other Persian restaurants, especially for the amount of food that I received. I ended up boxing up more than half of it to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. Overall an excellent experience. Next time I'm in the Phoenix area I will def be hitting up 1001 nights again.  If you have never tried Persian food, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good Persian food. The Lamb was outstanding. Some of the best rice I've had. Hummus was really good as well. The inside was nice, very clean, banquet style set up. Brought me right back to my time to the middle east. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Having bought a Groupon because we were. Going to be in the Mesa area for a couple weeks, we hadn't used it.  \"We'll, before it expires\" my wife said. So off we went, not really expecting much. Arriving at a totally dead strip mall, we were now expecting less.   Inside a simple entrance we found a large, ready to hold a function, room. Dark and decorated in deep red, the place seemed like an old fashioned restaurant waiting to be put out of its misery. The owner, a nice, older man, waited table. For all I could tell he did the cooking as well.  And what excellent cooking it is. How do you say delicious in Persian? We shared a chef's sampler and had another excellent meal's worth to take home, all three proteins were outstanding, and the grilled veggies were delicious..  As I sip my Iranian tea and tap out this ecstatic review,I'm sure we will return."}
{"text":"We went for a Groupon - the deal was $60 for 4 people. When we got there we were greeted by a server, her first day and she was too adorable and sweet, and picked our table. The restaurant is very large and we were the only ones dining for dinner.   The naan was not very good, it was thinner than usual and was served with butter which I have never seen before. We shared the falafel (a little too well done for me) the yogurt sauces was very tasty, ordered a bottle of Merlot, Baghali Polo (huge bone in and teh rice with fava beans was good) other people had the beef, chicken, or lamb kabobs. Everyone ate most of their dishes.   The owner and cook came out to check on us and when I looked around another couple came by for dinner. We later found out that on the weekends, they have a belly dancer so that makes more sense now as to how large it is, more \"entertaining\"  It's a strange, empty little strip mall. Hope it does well on the weekends. The overall experience was just average and it is quite the drive for us so not sure if we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The older gentleman others have mentioned in reviews greeted us and assured us we could come in an eat even though the large restaurant had virtually NOBODY else in it. As others have said, it's a little weird to go into this big banquet hall at 6pm on a Friday and be the only customers. Considering that, we didn't get much follow-up service to see if we needed anything (like the salad I ordered - see below). The DJ was not there but there was Persian music playing the whole time with a strong 4-beat that got a little annoying after a while.  We ordered 2 appetizers: Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves with a yogurt dip) were delicious; the Torshi (chopped vegetables in a vinegar) was not a big hit - even for my husband who really loves picked stuff. We ordered a homemade yogurt \"soda\", which the waiter described pretty well (with basil and dill and a bit salty rather than the sweet yogurt drink you would find in an Indian restaurant). It was interesting and turned out to be the best thing we got. A bit like a thin tzaziki sauce).  Before I get more into my personal experience, I have to say my husband ordered Baghali Polo (lamb shank) and it was falling off the bone and tender. He liked it a lot. I personally thought his rice (with dill and fava beans) was way too dilly, but there you are.  I ordered the Beef Shish Kabob, which came with plainer rice and broiled tomato, with an option to upgrade to all salad, or half rice/half salad. I asked for the half rice/half salad, but I just got the standard huge pile of rice and no salad with the kabob. The rice was pretty good, but the top sirloin could have been more tender - and the whole shebang left me with a strong onion aftertaste.   Not thrilled about going back (a few more breath mints will probably help with that), but we have another coupon so we'll probably give it another try. Maybe I will try the chicken next time and make a stronger effort to get a SALAD with it."}
{"text":"Persian food is my favorite! And I drive quite far to go to a favorite spot in North Scottsdale. So when my boyfriend found this new place close to home we were excited! We went quite early and on a Monday so it wasn't busy and he almost drove away. I asked him to give it a try and we were NOT disappointed! The staff was friendly, and accommodating , the food was fresh and cooked perfectly! We are excited to go on a Friday or Saturday and see the belly dancers, and enjoy some specials! I hope more people try this place, you won't be"}
{"text":"As I am a bit picky about food quality, I was concerned about this place being new.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  It was really good.  I ordered the Lamb Kabob entree with (1/2 rice & 1/2 green salad).  It was good.  The lamb was cooked well.  It was NOT chewy.  It tasted good.    Since I went there at lunch time on a Wednesday, it was rather quiet.  There are not that many patrons yet for this restaurant.  I was informed by the waiter and the owner that they have belly dancers at night, and there are a few other parties of sorts scheduled throughout the month.  I did talk with the owner, Mr Asadi, and he was a pleasant gentleman.    A lot of thought was put into the decor.  The next thing now is how to get the patrons to sustain the business.  This is one restaurant that I definitely want to see prosper.  I would hate for this place to close due to lack of business.    I recommend that you market yourselves to the various: Medical organizations in the area (many of the people who work there will enjoy this kind of food) other businesses or factories in the area."}
{"text":"went here as a group event and went with someone that is Persian. She said it was good genuine Persian food. There was belly dancing which really made the night.  The dancer pulled other women up ( who were obviously Persian) and were also amazing dancers.  I would say if you are looking for a genuine experience in Persian food and atmosphere it's a good place to go.  One complaint was a friend struggled a little because he was vegetarian however they made something special for him."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and we drove over twenty miles and the restaurant was closed ... 3:00 p.m.   Can't get my money back from Groupon since I purchased the coupon 4 days ago."}
{"text":"If you're craving for Persian food...then this place is a must try! Love how friendly everyone is. The food is out of this world delicious!"}
