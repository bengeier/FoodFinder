{"text":"Such poor service. I feel like I had to beg the grumpy waitresses to be served. The waitresses there have some attitude. I stood there waiting for a table and no one acknowledged me for a very long time. Heard the same thing from multiple people. Would not return. I would rather pay to go somewhere good and happy."}
{"text":"If you're used to Chinese restaurants then it's fantastic, but otherwise the atmosphere can be quite loud and messy (especially the washroom!) and service would be considered bad.  We arrived later around 9PM and it was only starting to pick up.  Apparently they open until 1AM.

We were visiting Calgary and came to Sun's in place of Tai Pan and we were happy to have done so as the food was beyond our expectations.  We all agreed that this place might have been the best meal we've had during our entire trip.  We were seated quickly and food arrived fairly quickly.  We were sitting closer to the kitchen so we never had a problem with our tea being left without a refill.  The service was meehhh but not terrible.  And my Aunt and Mom spoke Canto so that may have helped.  Pricing was decent.  They charge for rice but each bowl is massive and can be shared between two people.  If you enjoy the smokey-wok flavour type of Asian food (and on the saltier side) then this is the place for you.

Food has to be exceptional if service is meehhh!"}
{"text":"I have come here for lunch and dinner numerous times the past several years with both family and friends. It hasn't changed a lot except that you will taste the difference when they change or hire new cooks. This can be quite a loud place to eat at and the staff aren't the most attentive or friendly but it's also a place I would recommend for great BBQ meat and Chinese food. They can get quite busy too, especially during lunch time on the weekend.

The menu selection is pretty good with a variety of soup and stir-fried noodles, fried rice, sandwiches, congee, baked rice and spaghetti, and various Asian style drinks. If you're interested in their BBQ meats, go early to ensure you get what you want as it's only served during lunch time to about 3-4pm when they sell out. Although their prices are a bit higher than other places serving BBQ meats, the constant line of customers getting take out should tell you just how good it is. I will say that the wait time for food during lunch is the worst as it can sometimes be around 30 minutes after ordering.

Their regular dinner time runs to about 9pm before they bring out their late night dinner menu. The perk of this late night dinner menu is that the items are cheaper and when you order two dishes, you can get unlimited refills of Chiu Chow style congee.

Overall, a great place to go for good Hong Kong style food and we will continue to dine here for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years now and they have been one of the best but definitely my favorite chinese restaurant in all of Calgary

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I visited Sun's last night for the first time at about 10pm, and it was packed. As mentioned, there's great variety on the menu (you won't find ginger beef or chicken fried rice lurking on these pages)... and different stuff during the day, in the evening, and late-night. 

We ordered the Chinese fried dough with beef (the perfect late-night indulgence) and the Szechuan steamed fish (beware that if you're bothered by tripe, it does come with tripe mixed in with your fish). I've got to say, it was the most bizarre Szechuan dish I've ever had, because there was curry mixed in. Sure, you got your regular chilis and everything in there, but... curry/cumin?
 
Three things you need to know about Sun Chui Kee: 
Number 1- Pee before you go, because there is only one toilet, and it's always occupied. 
Number 2- The waiter/waitress doesn't have a grudge against YOU, he/she just doesn't care for anyone, and you need to make an effort to catch their attention to order, to pay, or to get any kind of service. 
Number 3- If at all possible, try to order dishes where you receive free congee, because ordering rice on the side will cost you much more than you ever thought possible ($4.00 for 2 people?!)"}
{"text":"Food is alright if you don't mind the service. The staff could downright be rude sometimes."}
{"text":"My change in rating is not because of the food. What they serve is still first class the whole way with some of the finest seafood and BBQ in the city.

What perturbs me is that the quality of service has dwindled and the prices have risen to the point of no longer delivering value for the money.

Without getting into the health aspects, eating out is not meant to be health food, I like to drink 3 to 4 soft drinks with my meal. Now, if two dine and consume say 7 soft drinks, the price will be $20.65 for soft drinks. That my friends is crazy and contempt for the customers; for me it is intolerable that a can of pop would cost $3.00 when the restaurant pays about 22.5 cents each.

For this reason I have removed this establishment from the list of Chinese restaurants that I can recommend. A family of 3 children and parents could end up spending $40.00 on soft drinks alone, most unreasonble. Unreasonable is the wrong choice of word; preposterous and absurd are more appropriate words to express my sentiments."}
{"text":"Hands down this is my most favorite place for Chinese!!! I'm never disappointed! Line ups can be long during peak hours brunch lunch or dinner but it is well worth the wait!!!! Have to check this place out!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"WOW is the word that I can best describe about the quality, taste and (spicy) flavors of the plates this sichuan restaurant offers. If you have a craving for spicy chinese food, this is the place in Calgary. I went there with a co-worker of mine that is chinese whom had been many times at this restaurant before. We wanted to order some duck but were sold out. Other than that, I give this restaurant two thumbs up! Keep in mind that it is not a place to take a date. You go there for the food not for the ambiance."}
{"text":"In spite of the bad service (especially if you are not Chinese, sometimes you will wait so much longer, and be often completely ignored) we used to go back  anyway because the food is authentic, late at night there's few choices on Centre St., and the menu is huge. The food has been really yummy. 

However, this time, I tried talking to the waitress about not adding the MSG (it's such BAD habit with Chinese restaurant, only places that are more evolved and realize their customers have allergies will remove the MSG)... Although her english was fine & she knew what I was talking about, she basically just said, \"No I can't request no MSG for you.\" (in other words we have to put it in everything even if we could make it for you without it).  Thankfully I'm not severely allergic like some of my friends, but I avoid it wherever I go, just as I always try to watch what I'm ingesting (Buddha's Veggie on MacLeod Trail does not use MSG and 'quel surprise' their food is still delicious).. 

The last straw though was the \"ling cod\" that we thought we were ordering (or even if it's white fish \"at market price\" -- we ordered the \"thai style\" fish.  The menu is so crowded we didn't notice that the price was slightly above the item, not across from it... Confusing.  The sauce was delicious but the fish tasted more 'muddy' and stronger than tilapia usually does.  Whereas most menu items were between $13 to $18, they overcharged us the \"market price\" of $21.95.  For tilapia, seriously???! 

From now on, we'll just drive a little farther and go back to our favourite downtown Chinese restaurant, Golden Inn restaurant, always open even later, where the staff are always much friendlier and the food is consistently good, not as pricey, and no \"mysterious market prices\" for the cheapest fish I could buy any day of the week down the road at the grocery store. 

Bye bye Sun's BBQ... where the sun DON'T shine.  
And no smiles are to be found."}
{"text":"For a long time, this place has been one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. The menu, which covers a wide variety of lunchtime BBQ treats or larger dinner entrees, is extensive. Service is usually very quick, however line-ups during the 7pm dinner hour on weekends can be lengthy and uncomfortable due to limited seating outside. The flavours, if flawed, can err on the salty side. Still, I have gone to this place many times and appreciate Sun's as a highlight among the Centre St. joints. I would recommend fresh ling cod or the fresh oysters if you're in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"I was here on a week day and they were relatively busy. Many of the tables had the aforementioned hotpot contraption- which one can order from the little menu stands? which are placed on every table. However, if you ask your server and describe it they should realize what you are taking about. I think currently they have one for spicy chicken and whole tilapia.

I found that the dishes we ordered were very unique, however the taste wasn't spectacular. The two kinds of mushroom dish was a little on the bland side. However, I liked the waving tofu/fish thing. 

Overall, not bad, however nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal here with friends. Pork & chicken BBQ with gailan & fried rice. All was good. Went early to get in front of the crowds. We will return"}
{"text":"Under restoration from a fire accident. Hope they will be opening soon. 
Missing the BBQ duck, late night menu..... and more..... 
Usually go to this place after getting back to town after a day trip at late night for the late night menu. I remembered price are great and free congee..."}
{"text":"Rating is strictly on food especially BBQ meats. The best BBQ in the city! Don't expect friendly servers. It can get really busy here. And I read a review, definitely do not take a date here unless you want them to experience first hand Chinese experience."}
{"text":"I would've given 4 stars if not for the terrible service.

This place is a favourite among my family members and I've been here lots.

Some factors to consider:

Food:  Very good!  I love the seafood and fried rice.  My fiance enjoys the mayo shrimp but that specific dish is expensive (16$ for such a small serving size!)  Everything else seems reasonably priced for the quality and size of the dish.  Mussel dishes are a bit salty.

Service:  Horrid.  I mean, this is an Asian restaurant so you can't expect the same service as Canadian restaurants in that servers do not check up on you and don't make a point in being polite.  But this was just ridiculous because they completely ignore you.  I did not appreciate having my waves ignored and then having to PHYSICALLY GET UP AND GO TO A SERVER to ask for more water.  Every time I've been there, servers will avoid eye contact and even be rude.  I feel like waving a server down and ordering a smile.  

Last time I went, my sister made a complaint to the manager who responded by being standoffish and smug.  We had not had beverages refilled for the duration of our meal (nearly 45 min) at least 4 servers had ignored my gestures.  We were given hot water instead of cold, so she made another complaint.  This time they gave us two cups of ice water for the 11 of us.  We left at that point.  

Parking:  Tight but at least it exists.  I drive a truck I have to be extra weary.

Overall, there are better Asian restaurants out there with quality service.  I would not recommend this place for the above reasons."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Calgary. 

The atmosphere here is very casual and quite typical for a Chinese restaurant. The restaurant is spacious and can easily fit large groups of 8 to 10 people. The service here is pretty good relative to most Chinese restaurants - I've never had anyone slam a dish on the table here. There are an abundant amount of waitresses here, so service is pretty quick. 

During prime meal hours this restaurant gets quite busy, so if you plan to go here for lunch it is probably best to show up a bit earlier. I am not sure if you can make reservations here, but I have never had to. 

The food here is reasonably priced and the serving portions are huge; I always have a lot of trouble finishing the food I order here. Depending on the portion size that you get, the average prices range from under $10 and from $10 to $20.

I go here specifically when I am craving hot and sour soup. Most places that serve this dish tend to do a very sloppy job of it (either they make it to vinegary, or they don't have enough ingredients in it). Sun's does a phenomenal of making it; the flavour is perfect and there's an abundant amount of ingredients that they use (IE. mushrooms, BBQ meat, bamboo, etc.). 

In addition to hot and sour soup, I like to get the \"yin yang\" dish. I am actually not sure what its called, but it is a seafood rice dish with half of the rice covered in a white cream sauce and the other half in a red tomato sauce. This and the soup are one of my favourite dishes and they are cooked quite well here."}
{"text":"I love Hong Kong style \"cha-chan-teng\" or cafes and this one isn't bad.  I come here everytime I visit my folks in Calgary, and I have to say, the won-ton noodle soup here is getting worse and worse. At the beginning, you could count 3 good sized shrimp in every won-ton. then it went down to two. And now it's down to 2 teeny, mushy, not-very-fresh tasting salad shrimps. 
The same was with the \"Thai-style\" ho-fun. It started out great, but then they stopped using the salted fish and became flavorless and boring. We left a note in the suggestion box, asking what happened to the salted fish? Fortunately, they put it back in. 
Let's hope we see an improvement in the quality of won-ton."}
{"text":"Sun Chiu Kee is definitely a place I've gone back time and time again. I love their salt and pepper egg plant - if you love egg plant, you want to order this dish; it might make you love egg plant even more!

Sometimes there's a long wait, but that really depends what time you get there. You have to beat out all the regulars that go there haha.

If you've got a small group of friends, its fun here. Hot pot or just any of their meat dishes are great to share. 

Two last words: lychee slurpee."}
{"text":"4.5 stars Resturant. Awesome BBQ duck lean BBQ pork.  This is a great place lunch and dinner. Quality of food is alway good, they also have fusion sandwiches that's basically sandwiches made with Asian influence. This is Hong Kong Style cafe restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Horrific service. But the food comes quickly after ordering, so who cares! As long as you go there with the mindset that the lack of western ideals of customer service is because this is a traditional cultural Chinese restaurant, you'll make out fine. Be polite, but direct and assertive. And order more at the end of the meal for take home. You'll want it for sure."}
{"text":"Great BBQ meats one of the best in Calgary. Really busy with very little parking. They are usually packed. Great as a late night food place after clubbing. Good prices, not that great in service. Good food and fast."}
{"text":"When searching for a place to eat my mind did not go straight to Chinese in Calgary. But it's what people wanted so I turned to trusty Yelp. Now this place didn't stand out based on the number of stars but after reading reviews, people who reviewed were deducting stars based on service. When I think of a really good Chinese restaurant, service is never great. So I ignored the service reviews and went with the pictures. 

And all I can say is WOW!!! The food here was so delicious!!

We ordered: 
- crispy fried chicken: a little dry but great flavor with the sauce. 
- salt and pepper fried pork: cooked to perfection! Exactly what I was wanting!
- beef with garlic and green onions: great flavor just watch out for the big chunks of ginger. 
- green beans with minced pork: best green beans I have had in a long time! So fresh and excellent flavor!
-rice noodles with beef: similar to chow fun dry style and it was exactly what I wanted! 

And as other yelpers commented, the service was just okay (but it's as I expected). This place deserves 5 stars because the food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So I came here with my girlfriend and another friend for a quick snack.  The food was amazing, but here's where my experience went sour to the point that I had to enjoy my food at home later that night.

The servers did not want to serve me since I do not speak Chinese.  Bad enough that I had to stand up and wave any of the 4 servers standing around down, but it was a slap in the face when they walked right past me even after nodding that they saw me.  WTF?  

Okay, we ordered our food, and then waited for over an hour (express meal my ass), only to repeat the process of flagging down someone, oh I get it, my friend was black, so they didn't want to come near our table.  He didn't even eat anything, he was drinking water ...

I don't know if my love for food can trump the racism and apparent horrific lack of customer service.  We didn't tip, but I think they should have paid us to sit there to be honest."}
{"text":"THE best place in Calgary for roast duck! My friend told me about this place a few years ago and we always stop by for lunch now whenever we're in town. You can either eat in restaurant-style or pick up your meats like you would at the butcher shop, easy peasy. They also have roast and barbecue pork, not just duck.

Our usual order is the BBQ #1 combo with the roast duck. Huge portions, so make sure you bring your appetite! The skin on the duck is crispy so it's got some slight crunch to it, and it tastes sooo good dunked in plum sauce. The combo is served with a huge helping of white rice, Chinese greens and a bowl of hot soup.

We tried the cream corn soup too but it was really watery, not thick like it should be. We also tried the shrimp-stuffed tofu, which wasn't bad overall but could have used more shrimp meat.

I think we'll just stick to the roast duck here from now on, you can never go wrong with it!"}
{"text":"This is the place i always get my bbq pork and bbq duck take out. Tonight decided to come here instead of cooking. I have been craving some congee so I order the lean pork and thousand year old egg congee. This is always my go to when I'm sick or just wants something to warm me up. It came in a hot bubbling clay pot. Flavourful and not too salt which was nice. We always order shanghai noodles and garlic & Onion beef in oyster sauce on hot plate. The noodles where saucy and seasoned well with lots of toppings. The beef hot plate came out sizzling and the beef was super tender. There was lots of onions and garlic and peppers. There was whole cloves of garlic in there, woah they could have chopped it up more. We left super full and happy. Look forward to next time."}
{"text":"Their food is ok but the wait for the food  was horrible!!!  So remember if you are in a rush don't go 10 feet near the restaurant.  Some of the food was very good but mostly its not very unique to a chinese person who eats out alot.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is not bad but they don't even have a seperite restroom for men and woman. It is only a one room public washroom for both genders.  The waiters have very bad service and they snapped at me when I asked them for some extra napkins.  Truthfully after the first visit and the impression it made I highly dought that I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Promotion dishes are excellent! We had the Fish-tofu-chicken hot pot ??????(?????) that came with a big bowl of lettuce and fatty beef slices. Large wok with huge portions, for only $23! Very delicious! Must try! Beef chow fun was very flavorful in big portion, too! Service was exceptional! Large parking lot right in front. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place blows away all my favorite chinese places back home. It is so much more authentic. We ordered the bbq pork, a spicy chicken dish, a spicy clam dish, and a soup. It gets a 5 star for the quality of the food, however keep in mind that I'm used to DC chinese food. I can't wait to try the other chinese places while I'm in town."}
{"text":"I come here regularly for HK Cafe style comfort food. Always hits the spot. This place is good for Calgary."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Beware: the parking at this plaza is awful. Sometimes I dread going there because of the parking.  It has different menus during the day and evening. Day time is hk styled meals with a soup and some bbq and you can also get noodles. Evening it's the classic Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Sun's BBQ is an authentic Chinese cafe ... and even an adventurous eater like me treads lightly through this menu.  From pig's ears, to duck necks, to chicken feet ... all of it!  I like the Wor Wonton Soup Hot Pot with a side of Salt and Pepper Tofu.  (...Comfort food...)

The restaurant is always packed and service is brisk.  Bonus: Every once and a while you might get seated by the live crab tank.  So, you know ... a little dinner entertainment!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food!!!!! Service is not the greatest but the food is AWESOME! Their BBQ is freaking amazing! Be warned weekends are insanely busy and the parking is scary!"}
{"text":"Brought some pals over to this place in hopes of bringing them a great late night alternative to the usual Chinese dishes offered. We still had a great time picking through the items in the menu-and everyone was easily distracted by the strange ingredients in dishes.

What drags the rating down to the mere three stars? Well these guys offered a special where if two items were ordered from the late night menu, we would get a free bowl of soup. We only noticed this detail-which was located on a loonie sized spot on the right hand side of the menu-after we had ordered. So when we brought it up to the second waitress as we were mid-way through our meal, she agreed it would be brought. It wasn't. And what was the explanation given to us? We didn't \"order it on time\"

Quick lets play mad libs!

Bull___!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the prices on the menu - the portion sizes you get here are ginormous and worth every penny. Honestly I think this might be the best chinese food I've had in Canada or in the United States - that's really saying something as most chinese food for me is either good but not memorable or bad to the point of being compared to an americanized chinese place :D.

Strongly recommend the beef flat noodle (one of the cheaper items on the menu and can easily feed 2-3 people). Lots of noodles, tender beef and bean sprouts. I personally also like the deep fried chicken (comes with shrimp crackers). Our crackers were a bit stale but the chicken is supremely juicy and tender, with crisp flavorful skin. Dip in a little of the salt mixture and you're good to go (note: it's potent).

You get a cup of sugar water (tong sui) at the end of your meal too for a light way to end what would be likely a food coma inducing meal based on how much you eat.

Note: they charge you for rice. :(. 

Go with a large group so you can sample the menu!"}

{"text":"One of the best Chinese food restaurant in Calgary. It's attached to a grocery store on centre street. There's free parking in the complex but not much especially since it's shared with the grocery store.

The restaurant itself isn't too big but the service is quick and I never had to wait more that a few minutes to get a table. For a Chinese restaurant where the waitress English is limited they were friendly. 

Now the food!!! I haven't had a bad meal ever. They have daily special and a lengthy menu items. The hardest part is just picking one. My favourite is the BBQ rice dish that comes with a lemon ice tea for an extra dollar. But the noodle soup dishes are amazing too. Come hungry so you can try more than one dish"}
{"text":"This is a typical Hong Kong style cafe. If you look up the definition of cafe it generally says something to the effect that it is a restaurant serving various beverages and light meals. Light meals don't apply to the type of fare here, the portions are generous and generally involve carbs like rice and noodles with meat and maybe some vegetables. Chinese food Hong Kong style means that it will include dishes that have been \"asianized\". You will have forms of spaghetti that you will never taste in any other type of restaurant together with the usual fast-food noodle shop fare that is barbecued pork, roast pork and roast duck served over rice, over noodles or with soup & noodles. You will also get rice dishes with tomato sauce that you won't find in any other type of Chinese restaurant. The menu will include popular Thai dishes as well as dishes from other Chinese regions such as Fukkien, Chiu Chow and other areas. In typical Hong Kong fashion, if it's popular and tasty and will sell ,they'll include it in the menu.
I love the roast pork here, one of the best in the city in my opinion, lean and yet the skin is crisp perfection. Tea is automatically served in plastic tumblers (very common in Asia) and it will be hot so don't grab and gulp if you're thirsty and risk scalding your throat and tongue. Cheap eats and fairly fast is the norm. Service is typical \"tell me what you want and if we have it you'll get it, if not, too bad.\" Don't expect to chit-chat or exchange pleasantries with the wait-staff. Decent food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese restaurant operated under the Taste of Asia Group.

Meals here are served family style accompanied by hot tea.

Service is abrupt, if anything, but given the steady flow of diners throughout the day, quick service is appreciated."}
{"text":"If you have a hankering for steaming hot congee (Chinese rice porridge) and Chinese barbecue meats (duck, royal chicken, soy chicken, roast pig (siu yook), barbecued pork(char siu)), you've come to the right place.

The good:  they have an extensive menu and have always been able to deliver flavourful, fresh, piping hot food.  My favourites include the BBQ combos (duck, soy chicken noodle soup), rice crepe wrapped Chinese donut, wonton/dumpling in tossed noodles, beef and rice noodles, congee and Singapore fried rice noodles.
I couldn't say the same for the drinks, since we've always had Chinese tea or ice water with our meals.   

The bad: this is a typical Hong Kong style cafe with good food and bad service.  Today there was a huge lineup in front of the barbecue meats counter and no-one was there to greet us as we walked into the restaurant (so I just found a table and sat down).  It's a lot of hard work trying to flag down a server; they always seem to be looking the other direction.   Also, the garnishes on each dish may not be the same as you had before--e.g. their beef congee usually comes garnished with green onions, but one time it came with crushed peanuts on top.  Our son was extremely disappointed, since he has a peanut allergy.

The ugly:  the bathrooms are disgusting (which is why I try not to go to bathrooms in Chinese restaurants) and the parking lot is a nightmare (to drive into and to drive out).
Especially on a weekend, street parking would be a safer option."}
{"text":"We've been going here for awhile and never had that bad of service, until today.  My husband and I went for lunch.  I ordered their BBQ duck noodles and he ordered off their tea time menu,  fried ho fan with beef.  Mine came right away,  his NEVER CAME!  We wait nearly 45 mins for his dish.  We've inquired with the servers at least 4 times to see where his dish is. They all said it's coming,  it got to the point where it never did and we gave up.  We got up and paid for my BBQ Duck Noodles, and left.  We will not be going back here anytime soon.  I would also say that this is a common issue with them where sometimes you have to ask the server where the food is after an unusually long period of time.  But they use to check the back and get back to you and your food will be out.   This time, after inquiring 4-5 times.... it just never came.
 
This is the first time I had to walk out of a restaurant after waiting way too long for food.  Don't be surprised if you have to do the same."}
{"text":"I have lived in Calgary for all my life, also been an asian all my life. Now, I've been to multiple Chinese restaurants, supermarkets, events almost anything you name it. But this place isn't the best place to visit. The bbq part of the restaurant is great but the restaurant part....not so much. I live near the area so I do come here often. Tonight I arrived at 9 and it took almost 50 min for all my dishes arrive. So dishes were highly salty and full of msg and others were bland and no flavour what so ever. The waitress had an attitude when asked where our food went even asking for simple, little thing, it was replied with attitude. When done, we asked for our bill and it took about another 20 minutes. When leaving, we didn't put tip. They chased us out asking for tip but they didn't realize by the look at our face that we were not satisfied with their service. But, the manager, now he is the only reason why I want go back, he supplies good service and deserves the tips we provide. Overall, this is a good place for a mid night snack but not for something formal or a date."}
{"text":"The BBQ is excellent but some of the waitress are stupid! Onetime I told them they don't have to give me too much meat and they come and accept it. I told them lets not waste it instead!!! It's also too expensive!"}
{"text":"Food was meh, service was garbage. I feel bad for the Chinese food lovers here in Calgary. I'm originally from Toronto where there's more competition and higher quality of food and service available. Staff was not respectful and worked at their own slow pace while they enjoy talking and laughing amongst staff."}
{"text":"Been a while since I last ate here, since we usually order roast duck and roast pork to take home. When I dine in, I often have the Japanese-style boneless chicken udon, which is moderately priced (less than $10) and comes in a huge bowl that could easily serve two people. My wife orders the beef congee and Singapore-style fried noodles. Good value, but don't expect smiling service, all the staff seem perpetually harried even when the place isn't crazy busy (and they do get packed, with long lineups)."}
{"text":"This is one of the Best Chinese restaurants I have come across in Calgary. The food was amazing don't pass without trying it. No dish will disappoint you."}
{"text":"After a horrible day, I stopped to grab a bite with a friend. The both of us were wiped out and starving, so we were happy to get a nice comfy booth to sink into. I was surprised to see that the menu was all asian noodle dishes, mainly soups. The benefit was that everything was pretty inexpensive, but the downfall was that I was craving protein like no one's business. Luckily they also had a lunch menu that had some pretty interesting dishes.

My friend settled on a chicken soup, and I got crispy noodles with beef in special sauce as the lunch special. I was pleasantly surprised to get a drink with that, so I grabbed some warm soy which I developed a weird fetish for when I was in Asia. I was definitely a happy camper. Our server was pretty sweet, and he definitely made sure we were comfortable and all set up.

Our dishes came and they were HUGE. My noodles in sauce were awesome, although I found the beef a little overwhelming. My friend's soup was alright, but she ended up helping me finish off my dish and taking hers to go. 

Finally, we grabbed some of the restaurant's BBQ pork to go. It was a great deal, and it is some of the best pork that I've had in Calgary. I was definitely impressed, so the next time I'm craving noodles or sweet and succulent BBQ pork, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've avoided going here for a long long time due to the horrendous service and poor quality drinks and food. The prices are absolutely outrageous for the very little portions you get. The drinks are watered down and taste like bleach. (Perhaps it's time to replace the plastic cups riddled with bleach dishwasher water.) All this and the most horrible service any restaurant in Calgary can give you. Oh Taste of Asia, I just don't understand how your servers go from good at Calgary Court to terrible at Sun's. One server in particular has always given bad service. She was waved down only to have her reply with an annoyed, \"What???\" Are you serious right now? If you truly hate your job that much just quit and save people the agony of going through you PMSing! They give you a comment card with your bill but unfortunately I did not have a pen on me to fill it out. I wasn't about to ask for one from an employee that's for sure!  I wonder if they would even take the comments seriously anyway. Ugh!! The fact that I gave them my business again after avoiding it for months just annoys me to no end. People need to just stop supporting this business so they get the idea that paying customers deserve to treated with respect."}
{"text":"It had been a long time since we ventured out for Chinese food with the kids and honestly did not know where to go. So I came to Yelp (of course) and searched up places to go.

Sun's was one that stood out on our side of town and off we went. Although after reading the reviews we were a little concerned about the service since several reviews point out service was not great. 

We arrived between 4:30-5pm. The lunch crowd was clearing out so we got a table by the window. So far so good. Menus and tea came right away. Big menu, lots of choices. We ordered four dishes based on what we thought the kids would like, so simple: house friend rice, sweet and sour pork, ginger beef and black bean chicken hotpot. There was a male server we flagged down a few times and he was really good. Our food came relatively quickly and steaming hot.

The kids loved it all, I was so impressed at how much they ate. It was delicious. The only downside to our experience was at least 3-4 pieces of the shrimp in the house friend rice had not been de-veined. Since we all know what that black line is (yuck), my husband spotted and removed those shrimp quickly.

We flagged over the waitress for our bill and took the leftovers home which we enjoyed the next day. 

We came with low service and high food expectations and since we came at a good time before the dinner rush, we weren't overly disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Our organization had survived a courageous and spirit filled meeting so after that I \"assigned\" one of our board members to take us all out for something to eat.  

It was approximately 10 pm and a couple of locations that we had checked out were already closed so Linda recommended a great Chinese location in the northwest.  Our car caravan made their way to an ample parking lot where we all could securely ...\"Park and Eat!\"

Once inside, our trusty translator Linda took it upon herself to introduce us to 6 amazing dishes.  And thank god she was there because service was great and the food was presented quickly on our table for our feast.

We had envisioned and talked about food all the way from the meeting so most of our appetites were ready to consume what was laid before us.  We had the Lobster with clams and clam sauce which was a special at 18.88, a Bok Choy and Portobello Mushroom dish, a Fish with Bitter Melon soup, some Pork Ribs and my personal favourite the Golden Tofu dish!

My goodness... we were hungry and the food was so tasty that our dishes were dizzily spiralling around on that lazy Susan like nobody's business.

Thank you Sun's!  You have now sparked a robust \"Try a different restaurant after meeting foodie club\" amongst our group.

The place although quite large in size is a nice intimate setting sitting kitty corner with large floor to ceiling windows.  It is quite clean and has a nice elegance to it and in my opinion deserves multiple return visits from this yelper."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot when we want a casual quick chinese meal. This is a hong kong style cafe. Do not go here if you are looking for lots of service. They'll take you to a table; give you a menu.  When you are ready to order, you will most likely have to wave someone down.  The food will come when its ready and if you need anything you will have to wave for a server.   Everyone comes here for the food and not the service.  We like to go later at night because they have the menus with special items.  Some of our favourite dishes are the squash with black olives (its got chilis), congee, hot and sour soup, thai style ho fan and beef with enoki."}
{"text":"I spent my formative years in Malaysia, so I have an affinity for places that have the look, feel, and flavor of places I frequented during that time.  Sun's BBQ is one of these.

Sun's is a very casual, and always very busy, annex of a popular Asian grocery store.  It's one of those confusing Asian places that has a number of different menus, some in English, some in Cantonese (Mandarin?), and some bilingual.  In addition, there are a number of specials advertised on various table placards and wall posters.  The food is mainly Chinese, with various dishes from other Asian cultures (though I suspect the authenticity of the non-Chinese dishes).

There's a bustling, frantic energy to this place, and I fully expected the food to be hastily prepared and presented.  I also expected at least one of our orders to be mistaken.  Happily, however, none of this was the case.  Everything was fresh, nicely plated, and delicious.

I need to come back here a few more times to sample the breadth of the menu(s), but so far everything I've had has been excellent."}
{"text":"Great late night dining!
can get very busy.
parking lot out front.... be careful of Asian drivers! hahah (I'm Asian so it's ok for me to say this!) hehe. :)"}
{"text":"There are multiple occasions where I drive by this place without thinking anything of it.  Jaime, Christine and I had a late girls night and it was time to head home.   On the way, I was really wanting to stop by somewhere but didn't say anything when mind reader Christine mentioned she was hungry for a snack.  Immediately I smiled and told her I was thinking the exact same thing.  We yelped a bit and pondered what we wanted to eat when she mentioned Sun's.  She said they had late hours and decent Chinese food for late dining.  SURE, I said.

Sun's BBQ is just off Centre street, they have their own parking lot but boy at this late hour it was pretty packed.  Walking towards the door I noticed little kids coming out with their parents.  It reminded me of late night eats in Hong Kong, LOUD, fast paced, chaotic but cool....doesn't matter what time in the AM it is, there's always people having some good eats and laughing.

We were quickly greeted and offered tea.  Christine and I decided to go for some sweet 'n' sour pork with pineapple and mayonnaise and we ordered a large order of rice because who doesn't like smothering the rice in the sweet and sour sauce?!  Anyway, it didn't take long for the order to come and it was just what we wanted.  Crispy, greasy, fatty....perfect!   I enjoyed the diced onions and peppers, it gave the dish nice crunch.  The sweet and sour pork also had a drizzle of mayo on top which we both agreed was unnecessary and could do without.  The portion of rice was large (as ordered), and it was nice and fluffy. 

Overall, this place is definitely the place to be if you are craving some decent late night Chinese food whether it's one of those drunken nights or that late tummy growling night....they offer a whole ton of food!  Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"Good Cantonese BBQ! This restaurant is inside a Chinese Mall in Chinatown, there are a few shops on the second floor mainly travel agent and other offices, on the ground floor is the restaurant and also an Asian Market.
Food is HK Style, fast and no nonsense, during busy hours eg: Lunch & Dinner, you will have to share tables if you come by yourself or just the two of you! If you are lucky that may be quite a pleasant experience to chat with another patron. Service also is no nonsense and straight forward don't expect any pleasantries! Just eat and go kinda attitude, food is good tho very solid Cantonese fare good for large parties, portions are huge so everything is designed to be shared!
They also take credit cards!"}
{"text":"Want some flavour bombs dropped in your mouth at 12 am on a Saturday night?? Then I highly suggest you make your way to sun chui kee to be assaulted ! Many exotic dishes can be found on the menu and while their are a few \"American Chinese\" items on the menu most of the fare here is more authentic Chinese and boy it ever delicious!!

While I can't remember the names of any of the dishes I can describe some of them to the best of my memories ability. \"seafood rice\" a fried rice with ocean jewels and tiny bits of of dried salted seafood for an extreme flavour punch, also I recall it having some flying fish roe which made it look very nice! Another one was this crispy cabbage pankake , it came with a dipping sauce and was texturally very appealing to me, the flavour was light and cabbagey.. I loved it!!! Another favorite was deep fried tofu with a spicy meaty sauce, this one was a table favorite! Just plain great!!! 

I love this place, although the service was quite decent enough, I do recall a mishap with some special not being brought to the table. However at the time I really didn't care ! I was enjoying the bounty that was already at the table!! I would come back here any day or night!!

{"text":"Definitely one of the best Asian food in town. Had a black pepper crab, pork bone pot with broth with side of slice beef and romaine lettuce, snow pea leaf and egg white fried rice. Definitely a party in my mouth and also the HK style milk tea is a must."}
{"text":"Love the Chinese barbecue meats! Best in town!
I usually order take out or go there for lunch / afternoon tea.

When the place is busy, u need to get numbers for lining up to get a table; sometimes u don't, just walk inside and tell them how many people. I think it's confusing  for people who do not know the language. 

The service is up and down; it depends on who is helping your table. The managers are all pretty nice; but it seems the customers are invisible for some of the staffs!

But so far this is the only place the cashier listen to my instruction to pack my order. When I order take out, my ECO friendly husband feels very guilty that we waste so many one time use things. So we decided to do something to limit the waste. So everytime we order take out, we will tell them not to give us setting (plastic spoon, chopsticks..) and sauces that we do not need. And especially the napkins!!! they are always wet after absorbing the heat and steam from the food.

Today I went there and ordered something from the afternoon tea special menu, and told the cashier (Ming is the name shows on the receipt) not to give me sugar and setting. When I was home, I found out she really remembered what I said!!!! Very good! coz other places always repeat what I say (do not need setting!) but still give me everything!"}
{"text":"Poor service! We had to wait for 15 minutes and were not even given a menu; we had to ask for it.  The service was overall very poor as the waitress never came to refill tea etc.  Also they discriminate on when and who to give the sweet soup (dessert)."}
{"text":"We went here for new year eve dinner and ordered a few dishes. We noticed one of the dish we order wasn't a fair size comparing to the other dishes we ordered so we told the server that it looks like half the serving is missing and she said it's like that.. we didn't argue just thought this place is crazy expensive if that's the amount we got for string beans. As we continued dinner we noticed the other table have in constant portions on these dishes too. So I'm just guessing there kitchen cook did a poor job on portions on their dishes. We end up spending 80 dollar on 4 dishes and no leftovers which is expensive! For the amount we spend we could've went for sushi.. it would've been cheaper too"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ items and great comfort Chinese food.   The roast duck was juicy and flavorful.   The bbq pork perfectly balanced sweet, savory, and char.  Cann't wait to try the roast pork, princess chicken, or soy sauce chicken.   

Would prob pass on the fried sui-gow, and stick to regular menu items.   

They also have pretty good lunch and late night specials."}
{"text":"All the food is tasty, it can be quite busy so may be waiting quite a long time, and it's you might want to ask if they use msg in their foods, 
if you have any allergies to it.

Other than that: I love their Chinese hot pot, with contains vegetables,
and stewed meat, as well as tofu, you can request that they leave tofu out if you prefer.

The bbq duck is nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside
a must buy: whether it's to go, or to eat in....!

Service is quick, efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"It's great for late night eats. They are open late, so that's good. It is very LOUD. Service is hit or miss. If you want great cafe style Chinese food, it's your place to go!  Fried rice with chicken and salted fish is excellent, great \"wok heat\" flavor. Crispy garlic chicken is also excellent, as well as the beef rice noodles."}
{"text":"Very good food but the service is a bit rude when you need to ask for utensils and drinks. Another problem that I had encountered was the portion size . Even for a man my size I saw the food portions Farley small to be worth the prices they are asking for . However the food they offer is very unique and tasty"}
{"text":"Ordered the Fish Ball in Rice Noodle Soup - Delicious!

Kai lan (Chnese Brocolli) in Oyster Sauce - So good.  How do they get the vege so green and tender?!?

Salt and Pepper Fish Fillet - quite good!  

Restaurant has been updated with new red wall tiles, new plastic dinner ware and new chopsticks.  

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sun Chui Kee, Pebble street and Forbidden...i have a feeling these restaurants have the same owner. Coz I have seen their servers between these establishments. amongst the 3, Sun Kee is my choice anyday anytime.... their food is good my favourite is their late night menu. 
their tofu is so soft and fresh. the waitress...depends who you get, but alot of them doesnt speak good english so its kinda hard to order. but food comes really fast. good portion size. its always busy so if you dont want to wait, go early."}
