{"text":"The worst restaurant I've ever been. They served us a half-cooked fish, and had no intention of apologizing at all."}
{"text":"Have been going there for a few years now!!  I would say this is among the top Chinese restaurants in Mississauga that we visit on a regular basis. Mr. Vincent (owner/head chef) takes a personal interest in his customers and as well as the food.  They make special dished for us that are not even on the regular menu.  We go there so often, that we know most of the staff now, and the entire team is just wonderful.    I would strongly recommend the following STAR dishes:  Tiger Shrimps in Shezwaun Sauce Tiger Shrimps w/Salted Pepper Spicy Diced Chicken w/Peanuts General Tsao Chicken Crispy Beef w/ Orange Peel Sauce Beef w/ Pepper & Black Bean Sauce Crispy Chicken w/Orange Peel Sauce Chicken w/Pepper & Black Bean Sauce Fried Rice w/Egg & Vegetables Fried Rice w/shrimp   Just close your eyes and order any of the above, You'll just love this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here several times but will never go back again.  The food is decent, but don't expect any sort of positive interaction from the waitstaff.  I was there yesterday with my family for lunch.  There was 10 of us in total.  We ordered one of the Chinese New Year specials which came with several dishes for a set price, but we wanted to order one additional dish.  The waitress kept thinking we were trying to substitue one of the dishes from the special.  She kept telling us no.  After several attempts and much frustration, we approached another server and he explained to her that we wanted the special and another dish - no substitutions.  After that things just went downhill.  Each course was slammed down on the table.  She brought out the soup and walked away, not even bothering to ladle it out into the bowls like every other Chinese restaurant I went to.  Whenever we asked for something it was greeted with a scowl.  Sometimes, whatever we asked for was \"forgotten\" and we had to go ask another server for rice and/or beverages.  The problem wasn't just limited to one waitress.  When we went up to another waitress because the original one forgot my soda, she didn't know what Ginger Ale was.  She asked me if I was sure that's what it was called?!?!  The final straw came when we realized we had already paid the bill and had not been served dessert yet.  I didn't bother approaching any of the servers this time - I went up to the cashier and asked for our dessert which was part of the special we ordered.  He said that they didn't offer dessert until after 5, but offered me fortune cookies instead.  They didn't bother to tell us this when we ordered and didn't offer us any other compensation as a result.  My brother was so frustrated he went up to the cashier and got some money back since we were not able to get any dessert.    I eat out at Chinese restaurants frequently and am dumbfounded by the attitude of all the employees at the restaurant this day.    I DO NOT recommend this place at all.  There are plenty of places to get Chinese food in Mississauga where you're treated with a little respect and consideration."}
{"text":"I had a dinner with my parents today. I loved this place so much and recommend to my parents. We ordered sweet corn and chicken soup and shrimp dumpling deep fried chicken triangle for dimsum and general tsao chicken, stir fried bokchoy and young chow fried rice.  The food wasn't great it used to be but it was okay... Almost end of our meal. We found the dead spider in the fried rice. It was disgusting and horrified what we just found in our plate. We called the server and let them know and they called the manager of the restaurant. The manager apologized but he was keep saying its their first time and it might be the spider from the wall happened to be fell down on our food.  The way the servers react to this problem was very poor service. They only took out the fried rice on our bill and charged everything else.    If I wanted to be an ass about this I could of reported to the ministry of health.  But whatever I would never ever gonna dine there again.  They really need to concern about their kitchen's sanitary and pest control.  AWFUL EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Late reveiw I ordered from here a while ago a few times and every time the food was very good but it's definitely one of those places you need to know what your ordering unless your like me and just being adventurous haha. Don't be afraid to try new things you might even find that you enjoy it!  I will order from here again In the future when I am In that area again!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a few nights ago and was not disappointed. In the heart of Mississauga's Chinatown, many businesses and restaurants have come and gone - yet this restaurant still remains, possibly as one of the last remaining gems in this little plaza.   I went to this restaurant many many years ago when it was still a bit of a dingy place, and decided to try it again. They have definitely improved - the decor is now much more modern and chic, and has a lot of daily/lunch \"specials\". It's mostly an authentic Chinese restaurant but I find they have a lot of fusion type dishes to make things more interesting, something that would appeal to younger customers like me.   We had one of their 2 lobsters for $20 special, and it was definitely decent. I actually ordered just a regular vegetarian tofu dish on the menu - and to my surprise, it was my favourite dish! I really like this because when a regular menu item taste good, it's a generally good indication that the restaurant has good food and not just the specials. None of the items on the menu seemed to be unreasonably price, which is a plus.  My mom personally knows the head chef and he's super sweet and you could tell genuinely cares that his cooking satisfies his customer. It is family run and owned, and I always support these type of businesses because you can see they truly care about their food and service. If you're looking for some good authentic, but not totally boring, Chinese food - I think this place would not disappoint.   Definitely worth a try if you're in Mississauga and planning to visit Chinatown."}
{"text":"So recently i went to this restaurant called Best Friend and trust me they were anything but. Now don't get me wrong i know we went there late and were prob the last table but only cause we didn't know when the restaurant closes but we still saw another table there still so we took a table since the \"hostess\" waved/flapped her hand to a table we could take. Now we got a waitress who basically just tried to tell us what to eat which okay at first was funny but when she threw one of the menus(a piece of paper) basically at my moms face that pist me off but i didn't say anything cause i thought okay maybe it was an accident. Then we ordered three ginger ales and water non of which we got till we pressed a button that you get at your table i assume is for when there busy and nope they were not. Now don't get me wrong food was amazing but that service was dreadfull. Don't get me wrong you can do a lot and I'll brush it off cause i work in the industry so I'll always leave a tip but this time with that kind of treatment no. Oh one last thing i found a hair in my food yay fun times so if your in mississauga and see Best Friend restaurant just don't go at night cause you could get hair in your food and menus thrown at you"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in the GTA. We frequent Best Friend regularly and are now known to the staff. not unlike most Chinese restaurants, the service is seemingly a little less than... \"friendly\" but quick. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone if I weren't so afraid that I'd end up having to wait for a table. No one should go here. Ever."}
{"text":"Second time this week as too tired too cook.  Sweet & sour chicken and steam rice, beef & onion on rice noodles & steamed BBQ pork buns.  Hong Kong milk tea to complement was warm but ok as it was a late lunch at 3pm and staff were also having their lunch.  Thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"This place is quite pricy however we ate here on a weekday and they have a cheaper lunch menu with limited items. Noodle soup for 6.99 and some dim sum items for$2.99 and$3.99. Flavor is not bad. Service could be better. I'd eat here again but not high on my list."}
{"text":"I grew up in Sauga and moved to Toronto. I have fond memories of coming here with my parents. One day we decided to make a trip to Sauga and somehow decided to pass by here. We were quite disappointed.  There are signs that this place is catering to less Chinese people and more to \"foreigners\". As a result the food here is less authentic. And heck, they even have Korean texts on the language now. And half the patrons were not Chinese.   Anyways the food was mostly just \"ok\", and there are clear signs of them being stingy on ingredients. The so called chestnut chicken was severely lacking in chestnuts. The lamb hotpot could have used more lamb and more of everything. Tofu skin curds really aren't that expensive. Come on! We needed some carbs and got a fried rice. Lots of rice, and the amount of seafood does not correspond. The steamed fish was incredibly small compared to what I can get at congee queen or any other chinese place with \"fish tanks\" on display.   Nope...never coming here again. Pretty glad we moved to Toronto where there are better Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable price. Took family out tonight and we had a very enjoyable time. Service was excellent, thanks Margaret."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a kid when the Mississauga Chinatown was good and was jamming.  Now, it's a sad shadow of it's former self with all the urban sprawl happening around Mississauga and more people willing to travel to the east end for food these days.   However, I haven't been in the restaurant recently, but my mom told me that it's a lot more up-to-date than it used to be, but this review is purely on their delivery.    Timing of delivery: 30 minutes to an hour.  45 minutes at the most. Impressive for a Chinese place.  Some of my recent orders have included deep fried tofu with salt & pepper, hot and sour soup, fried oysters with salt and pepper (yes I know, I like my salty and spicy foods), eel fried rice, shanghai dumplings.    Honestly, all the spicy foods and deep fried foods are excellent, especially the deep fried oyster. Definitely recommend that.    Eel fried rice - not bad, but not excellent.   Shanghai dumpling - they are okay, but hard to judge considering they were in a foam container so it's not really fair to judge those unless you eat in.    For delivery, definitely recommend and they are on Just Eat.  For dine-in, TBD."}
{"text":"I have returned to Best Friend Restaurant several times since writing my initial review. I'm happy to say, I am a fan! The food has been good. It's well seasoned and very tasty. We always order the snow pea leaves. Delicious!!  If you are planning on visiting, leave your expectations for good service at the door and just go for the food. That way you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good decor  Lunch special I had  - L10 spicy tofu with pork was very mediocre.   And the waitress brought the dish with her thumb in the dish.  Gross!!!.   My wife had L8- beef dish with radish.  That was better.  She ordered chicken soup with papaya.  She say was barely ok.  Would not come back here.  Come-on, Thumb in customer's food???!!!  How about using a tray to carry food, instead of carrying dish with your hand and using thumb to get a better grip.   When the waitress brought the food, her thumb was in the sauce, and her thumb had sauce on it.  I looked at her, and she looked at me.  What a moment.    Owner should take notice and make sure the food is carried on a tray not with fingers, and having fingers in food dishes.  That is very unhygienic and disgusting.    F grade!"}
{"text":"We just happened by this place while shopping at Big ALS pet supply store next door.   The food was great with big portion sizes.  We intend on going back to try some of their sizzling platters and may hot pot."}
{"text":"I really disliked this place.   My family and I hadn't been in the area in awhile and came for the dim sum place that is next door. However, it was closed so we came here instead.  When we sat down, the lady that took our order seemed annoyed for absolutely no reason. After repeating our dimsum orders twice, we also ordered a chicken dish from the main menu.  The food came out in weird intervals and look a very long time. The first to come out were the shrimp triangle dumplings, the BBQ pork buns and the black bean spare ribs. The shrimp dumplings tasted like they were frozen and reheated. It basically was like mush and broke apart when I bit into it. The spare ribs had only a sprinkle of mashed up black bean on top and the flavor definitely was not incorporated into the dish at all.  By the time the next round of dishes came, we were long done with the first round. Next came the scallion pancakes and the chinese fried dough. I had the pancakes and they were actually pretty good. My brother and mom didn't have any complaints about the fried dough either. However, my mom wanted some soy milk to go with is, so she asked our waiter. It never came.....  Then after we had finished those, the shu mai came and after that the big bowl of congee. I was pretty excited for the congee excepted the duck eggs were hard and rubbery. I had to really try to chew them. The pork was also SOOOOOO salty. It was like cured or salted ham. It was definitely not enjoyable.  After all of the above dishes were finished, we were still waiting for the chicken dish we had ordered separately. At this point, we've been waiting longer than we spent eating and really just wanted to get out of there. So I called a waitress over and said that if they hadn't made the dish yet, we don't want it. She goes to check and THEY NEVER PUT IN THE ORDER.  TWO forgotten orders, slow service and mediocre at best food earns this place two stars in my book."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Chinese restaurant. If you live in Mississauga you have to check it out. I suggest the lunch menu from Monday to Friday super cheap 7 dollars per dish comes with choice of soy milk, Hong Kong milk tea or milk tea mix with coffee. The fried rice, Cantonese fried noodles are good."}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST FOOD OVERALL !!!!  Truly a chef/ owner that shows his passion in his food. Everything on that menu is amazing .... hot and sour soup the best in Toronto !!!!   \"You gotta eat here \""}
{"text":"That's the best one that I have been, you have to try it and you won't be regret..... Let me tell you how much I love it, it tastes so good and the view of restaurant is good well..."}
{"text":"Nice, bright & clean place, friendly waitresses. We started ordering the hot & sour soup(w/ shrimp & pork) which tasted so good! Also We had the goat brisket w/ dried bean curd hot pot, a sizzling spicy chicken w/ dried vermicelli, plus my favourite young chow fried rice. They were all A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!  The only food which tasted effing awkward was their steamed sole fish which was uber soft and had a weird after taste. Other than that, everything is great!!"}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant, such a great atmosphere, the people were friendly and food was pretty good! Here's what we had:   Eggplant with Minced Pork (5/5) - this was AMAZING! My favourite dish of the meal. Super tasty and the eggplant was tender without being gooey.   Steamed Fish (2/5) - not good! Seems frozen, wasn't well flavoured, not enough ginger or soy sauce for my liking  Scrambled Eggs with Broccoli (3.5/5) - pretty good, nothing spectacular though   Green Beans with Minced Pork (4/5) - loved by everyone! Super tasty and the beans were especially crisp  Steamed Chicken (1/5) - not great, this was disappointing to be honest but everything else was great enough for anyone to overlook this   Don't forget to order some lemon tea omnomnom   PRO TIP: a couple stores down is the BEST bahn mi store in sauga. THE BEST. If you leave the area without some bahn mi you'll  regret it! (The tofu shop is also great)"}
{"text":"Our order: Dinner combo (4 dishes for 4)  Pros + AMBIANCE:Cute decor. Random big pig face painting on the wall. Bizarre 80s/90s shows on TV.  + HOURS: Open on family day/public holiday. As you'd come to expect from any chinese or asian establishment.   Cons - W/R: Tiny. Cramped.   The only saving grace from this restaurant was the soup that came as a starter. The fish was lackluster, the lamb nothing special, the tea bitter & the chicken rather mediocre.   I prefer blue lagoon down the strip."}
{"text":"Judging from the lengthy menu, I am guessing the owners are either Shanghainese or Taiwanese, as many of the offerings did not seem to be either northern or southern Chinese dishes - perhaps someone familiar with regional Chinese cuisine can identify it for Yelp.  In any case there was lots of stuff involving congee.  We stuck to some fairly standard stuff, sizzling black bean chicken and Szechuan style beef, though I did order an appetizer of jellyfish (presented as a cold salad with carrots and pickled daikon) that was wonderful.  (If you haven't had jellyfish, it's nothing at all gross - think pasta made out of protein).  All dishes were very good and in a more authentic manner, did not use much sugar.  Decor is fun but the restroom area needed to be a lot cleaner.  An amusing sign on the men's urinal read \"Please fresh after your use\" - someone had relettered it to say \"Please flush after you use.\"  The service was abrupt but friendly - kind of like diner style waitresses with Chinese accents.  We will be back as I'd like to try some of the more authentic dishes."}
{"text":"We drove into the Mississauga Chinatown the other night just to grab some quick takeaway as I was in the mood for Chinese food.  We decided to stop into Best Friend Chinese because I had recalled a friend mentioning it before.  The staff was very friendly in assisting us and I ordered the chicken with black bean on rice dinner special - I think it was just over $10.  They cooked it in a fairly decent time and, being half Chinese, I can tell you it was authentic Cantonese cuisine.  The chicken was so tender and flavourful and the peppers and onions were cooked just tender crisp and not greasy and MSG tasting like a lot of other Chinese restaurants.  Even the rice was nice and fluffy but still al dente.  Very generous portion too - I ate the other half the next day for dinner.  I would highly recommend this restaurant; they have a ton of items on their menu as well.  We will definitely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Ordered a few dishes here to share, which is always nice. And it is easily found in the Mississauga China Centre.  Had a nice meal here with a friend, but nothing stood out. Actually, there was this one thing. They have a portrait of Journey to the West and even stranger is a whole portrait of Zhu Bajie. Why him of all people? I cannot begin to fathom. And I would come back here."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting atmosphere. Choice of decor (i.e. paintings) are weird, but i guess they'd be good Ice breakers or conversation starters. Cleaner than eating at the food court in this mall.   I have eaten here several times and have not been disappointed. First time trying duck tongue was here and it was good. Other favorite dishes are taro birds nest with snow peas and seafood, crab meat and fish maw soup,  king mushroom with green leafy vegetable (that I can't remember the name of), and deep fried garoupa fish.   A little on the pricey side for Chinese food, but still decent prices for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese restaurant my family and I have been to. After spending over $70 on three meals, we left hungry and went for pho after.  We ordered the double green onion and ginger lobster, fried rice noodle with beef, clams in black bean sauce, and seafood chow mein. The portions were small and expensive for the amount received. It didn't seem as if there was actually two lobsters for our lobster dish. They ran out of rice noodles so we never got that. 70% of the clams were empty. The chow mein was average and it barely fed the five of us. Service was pretty bad as well. We asked one of the servers for a coke and she points to another person. But that same woman brought our dishes to the table.  Worse experience ever. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This establishment gets one star for the young guy who served us with a pleasant smile and tried to fix the kitchen's mishaps and serve the entire restaurant while the other two \"servers\" texted on their phones. We were served microwaved dim sum that included raw shrimp and smashed rice rolls. After saying \"excuse me\" a handful of times to get the attention of an ill attentive server, I pointed out the raw shrimp and it was taken away, no apology and with stomping feet. REALLY?! To the one attentive server, you are better than this restaurant!! It's not your best friend!!! Get out of there!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place accidentally while searching for a place to find sushi and was very pleasantly surprised.   Nestled away in a beautiful plaza off of Dundas it was the only place open after 9pm so we headed inside to find a small yet spacious restaurant with some pretty interesting artwork adorning the walls.  We were promptly greeted and sat at a rather large booth offering a lot of space with black tea that was unlike many I've had before at Chinese restaurants.  I found the menu refreshing because they were easy to read, seemed fairly new, in good condition and had pictures.... Glorious pictures that made ordering a little easier and the experience all the more appetizing.   We ended up ordering wonton soup for 2-4 people and it was a generous portion I will say and extremely delicious.... The wontons were filled with shrimp and this pepper like spice that really made it stand out from other wonton soups I've tried.  We stuck with an old standby that never fails, Cantonese Chow Mein with crispy noodles and it was fantastic as well as the spicy chicken sizzling plate which had just the perfect amount of heat to compliment the tender chicken.   To top it off it wasn't even expensive, quite affordable in fact coming in under $40 after tax so I most certainly will be venturing back to likely try their hot and sour soup next time"}
{"text":"I really like tiger shrimp in Szechuan Suace! It is very delicious. I strongly suggest everyone to try this.  Also the lobster is very delicious and cheaper than other restaurants. It only $28 for two lobster! We always order these. Best Friend is a good place to eat food!"}
{"text":"After a decade,I decided to drag a friend out west for authentic Chinese versus downtown .Haven't been since their renovation,whenever that happened.Didn't set friend's expectations high,it's the food,not the great service at 9pm.We ended up having a great supper,with accompanying service despite a long day for the staff.Hope to return before another decade's up..."}
{"text":"Pretty good HK style Chinese spot in Mississauga. Nothing particularly great, but it was what I was expecting. Doesn't quite compete with some of the places you'll find in Chinatown or in Markham/Richmond Hill. Good selection of items, the food is tasty and quick. Slightly pricey given that it's just a chopsuey joint with fancy décor, but if you're craving Chinese in Mississauga it's worth trying out."}
{"text":"This was recommended by the teller at HSBC across the road. We ordered shrimp dim sum, chicken feet, steam oysters in black bean sauce and steamed oysters in garlic lemon sauce, hot and sour soup and seafood stir fry. This was entirely way too much food for 2 people and could have been pointed out but good thing we ended up cancelling the stir fry.  Lori our server was very helpful and accommodating. We had dietary requirements and we was good with that.  The food was fantastic, the steamed oysters were too dry and we informed Lori.  This is great value for money. I suggest everyone should try this place."}
{"text":"Also für ein chinesisches Lokal ist das mit abstand eines der schlechtesten. Essen sind nicht klar definiert. Service ist eher nicht so toll. Man behält Augenkontakt und man spricht auch welche an. Einfach ignorieren ist nicht die feine Art! Auch bei Extras hören die wohl nicht genau zu. Wollten keinen rohen Huhn haben um eine Suppe zu machen. Weil bestellt wurde schon eine Rindersuppe. Und dann in den hot pot mit dazu? Nicht toll! Man entschuldigt sich auch nicht für Fehler, sondern es wird hingenommen. Möchte man zahlen und man ruft jemanden, wird man wie gesagt ignoriert. Preislich untere Mittelklasse. Ambiente geht so. Aber Ansicht kann ich das Lokal nicht empfehlen!"}
{"text":"I love thier fish and tofu served in their hot pot.  Service there is great.  My husband does noy like any of their fried rice.  I dont mind it.   My parents and husband say thier swet and sour pork is tender and flavorful.    They serve complimentary soup and dessert here."}
{"text":"Amidst the streets of Mississauga lies the Mississauga Chinese Centre, and there is where you'd find the Best Friend Restaurant. Whatever you call it, I honestly don't have the words to describe this restaurant.  The servers here, especially this one lady, was like watching someone's reaction to a movie from start to finish - exciting and hyped up (trying to upsell literally every dish on the menu) to dank and dreadful (literally not giving a damn). She had mustered enough energy to sell 5 dishes that afternoon.  Green Onion & Ginger Lobster: Wasn't bad, but wasn't really that good either. The lobster was tough and rubbery and overall, it was really dry. The flavour was alright, but that alone wasn't enough to save it. Also... fried taro strips on top? Not pretty common, but I'm fine with that.  \"Korean Vegetables\": This was one of the dishes the waitress was heavily upselling. For $15, you get a plate full of what looks like something a Buddhist temple would serve after prayers. Something along the lines of Buddha's Delight. I can see why she was upselling it though... looks like it only cost 50 cents to make. Disappointing.  Green Beans with Minced Pork: Probably one of the only dishes I didn't mind. It's hard to mess this one up. The beans were cooked to the right doneness (tender, with a nice snap to it) and the minced pork gave it the right amount of saltiness. I could do without the random fried vermicelli bits though.  General Tsao's Chicken: My gosh... this was horrid. They messed up the coating on this real bad. All I could taste was flour. Not batter (cause fried batter covered in sauce is fine), but flour. It was gritty, damp, and disgusting.  And holy **** (pardon my language), this last dish looked like they were bored out of their mind and watched all 15 seasons of Top Chef. It was chicken stuffed with this rice mixture with a side salad doused in sesame sauce. It came on a slate inside a cloche with smoke trapped inside. I came for CHINESE FOOD man, not some weird experiment. If I wanted that, I'd go somewhere else. Anywho, this dish looked like chicken, but tasted like fish. Like seriously?  It was that bad.  This place honestly deserves a 1-star, but I'm giving it 2 for the entertainment value.  A well known man once said, \"Your worst enemy could be your best friend, and your best friend could be your worst enemy.\"  I really think it's the latter only."}
{"text":"What a delicious meal! We chose the pick 3 option: deep fried tiger shrimp served over a bed of chicken in black bean sauce, deep fried chicken and beef with onions and mushrooms in a sizzling skillet. The dinner came with soup (tonight's soup was carrot, papaya, tomato in a beef broth) and dessert (Chinese dessert) - you have to order the rice separately ($1.75 each). When we sat down at 4:30, there was only 1 waiter serving 5 tables. Service was quick, the food came out piping hot and we still had leftovers to take home. A lot of the other patrons ordered lobster - we'll have to try that next time. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating was that the decor and seating area is dated and a bit on the dirty side (don't expect white linens). But if you want to fill your tummy with good food and not end up with a bill of over $80 for dinner for 2, come try this place!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for ages, I was really disappointed with the service that was provided to us when I stopped by recently. The menu here is a little more expensive than what you would normally get considering their portion sizes. We wanted to order a fresh tilapia fish but the server suggested us to order a more expensive fish dish that was made from frozen fillets. We insisted on ordering the fresh one instead and the waitress came back later to inform us that they ran out of fresh tilapia and asked us to order the previously suggested dish. We denied the second time and looked over the menu again to find something else. After taking some time to decide and unable to find a substitute dish, the waitress came back and told us that we could order the tilapia. We didn't see any of the chefs come out and grab one of the live fishes from the tank which really made us question whether the tilapia we got in the end was fresh at all as well as their business practices!"}
{"text":"Best Friend Chinese is one of those forgettable Chinese food joint..... One of those that I went and ate and totally forgot I have been there? And doubt I would be going back again?  We ordered a few things to share... What did we order??   Braised Beef Noodle Soup Wonton Noodle Soup and More Soup  Everything were a little off.... but big portion and reasonably priced.  Huge Menu.. a little overwhelming...  Why we ended up with all soup?!"}
{"text":"waitress wiped spoon by thumb at behind..I`ve seen samething at another chinese restaurant around.. They have no sense of hygiene.. yech!!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambient, many selection of foods. However I think we made mistake ordering dim sum as they weren't good at all and I can tell they were processed frozen, came out soggy.    we also ordered Cantonese chowmein, and house congee, the presentation of dish was nice. Over all, food flavour was bland, not too much flavour.  Shrimp tasted little funky.. lol However,  I don't mind coming back and try out other dishes before I make a better judgement."}
{"text":"We love to go to Best Friend for Dim Sum. There is never any waiting and every dish we've had is very tasty"}
