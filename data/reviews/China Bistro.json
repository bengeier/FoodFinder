{"text":"We took a trip to Hoover dam from Vegas, we thought to give a try on this restaurant, got to tell you this is an amazing Asian fusion restaurant. All of us loved the food and more than that we loved the waitress (Angel), she knows what we might order and she also made recommendations and they were are all awesome. Kimchi fried rice is a must try. If you are visiting Hoover dam and if you are looking for food options this place will never disappoint you. AMAZING FOOD and AMAZING SERVICE."}
{"text":"Me n my daughters favorite place to eat at.. Fresh Fresh veggies,  most flavorful delicious food brought out surprisingly fast by very friendly staff! To die for house pan fried noodles,  chicken pad se yew, vegetarians delight,  wor won ton soup,  coconut shrimp.. For me n my daughter this place seriously puts all other chinese asian food establishments to shame.. Cleaner than most also.."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food i have ever had, the Orange Chicken is to die for. The service was amazing and was super fast. The waitress was very kind and eager to give us amazing service. The atmosphere was great and the amazing food made it even better. I high recommend this for anyone in the area looking for amazing Chinese food."}
{"text":"My son and I went there tonite to support a new business.  Sadly, we will never go back.  ! The only good thing was the Thai tea. I had lettuce wraps which wad served with something like a Thanksgiving dressing.  About 1.5 tablespoons of peanut dressing, and iceberg lettuce.  When I asked for more lettuce I was served something so slimy I couldn't pick it up out of the serving dish.  Plus our server was eating a wedge of watermelon just before she gave us the check.  Sorry, but that is not professional."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the food was good, not superior, but pretty good. I tried the Kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, wonton soup, and mapa tofu. The Kung pao chicken was mediocre, Mongolian beef was nice and sweet, wonton soup was phenomenal, and the mapa tofu was better than most. Overall, good service and good food."}
{"text":"We had the sweet n sour chicken and the chicken pad thai with the vegetable egg rolls with their homemade sweet n sour sauce, which was the absolute best sweet n sour sauce we have ever had. The server was very friendly and the food came to our table really fast. If you're  up for some really good food go to the China Bistro!!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Food quality of a restaurant you would find on the Las Vegas strip, for an absurdly low price. I'm not kidding.  Let me start by saying that there is no reason why this place shouldn't have a full 5 stars.  The place is owned and operated by an older Asian couple -- they're the only people I've ever seen working here. The woman is the waitress and busser, and is extremely pleasant and cheerful, and the man is the chef; he is usually in the back cooking, but sometimes comes out to make sure you are enjoying the food. The food is always perfectly prepared and the restaurant and restrooms immaculately cleaned.  For lunch, you would have to try pretty hard to spend more than $10, with most dishes being around $6-7 and include soup, an egg roll and side of rice. The food is presented beautifully, which I normally don't care about as long as it tastes great -- just figured I'd mention it since your run-of-the-mill Chinese place just slops it on the plate.  What I really care about is the quality of the food, and for the price range it is truly second to none. For the quality of the food here I would have no issues paying $15-20 dollars a plate, which is about twice the price of a normal meal there. There is no doubt that everything is prepared fresh, and that the chef honestly cares about what people think about his food.  And lastly, the thing that really sold me is the fact that the Thai food (curries) was fantastic as well! I love panang curry, and China Bistro's was as good as any I've had in the Las Vegas valley.  If you're passing through and like Chinese/Thai, give this place a shot! The building is really plain and hard to spot, but the inside is quaint -- nothing special though. I hope these nice people stay in business for a long time, you can't beat the quality of the food nor the quality of the staff for the price!"}
{"text":"Great little Chinese place.  New management has it together.  Has more staff now to accommodate patrons.  We are always happy stuffed and full. We will come back."}
{"text":"Last week we were on a trip to Hoover Dam driving through Boulder City, NV. My friends & I had  lunch at this Chinese Restaurant, China Bistro. The food there were so delicious & great customer service, we end up eating there for a few days during our stay of sightseeing. We will go back there again. Thanks Jennifer!!"}
{"text":"not really sure why some of the reviews are the way that they are, cuz the food is always hot, delish and fast."}
{"text":"Delicious food !!!  Kimchi Fried rice and Kingpao chicken were amazing and tasty!!!  Service was awesome and very friendly !!!!  Definitely a must place to eat Asian food if visiting Hoover Dam!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, great Chinese restaurant.  We live in Seattle and have many great Chinese restaurants to choose from,  this one is up there with some of the best.  We ordered our food to go since we were just passing through.  The service was prompt, and friendly, the food was hot, fresh, and delicious.  We ordered sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, bbq pork, as well as some other spicier dishes. Yum, a definite stop next time we pass through. Do try!!"}
{"text":"Took the kids here for a cheap lunch buffet ($3.99 adult, $1.99 kid buffet). Not the freshest overall, a bit  dirty and we walked out hoping we would not get sick that night.  All turned out fine but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I spit out three different things.  Shrimp in fried rice was stinky.  Fried Rice itself was not at all tasty.  Soy sauce in a sticky, nasty decanter that hadn't been washed in ages.  Egg Roll was inedible, besides also being cold.  Cashews in Cashew Chicken were stale and nasty.  Not much meat in Cashew Chicken.  Veggies in cashew chicken were not just crisp, they were totally uncooked.  The lunch buffet looked horrible.    The woman taking the orders was nice and I debated whether to write this review because I don't want to harm her business.  But, like one other reviewer, I am concerned that I will be sick after eating there.  Also, I had myself psyched for some fried rice.  In both the public interest and my great disappointment, I decided to go ahead and write.  I should read Yelp reviews more often BEFORE I go out!"}
{"text":"I've been to here two weeks ago with my sister's family. I don't think the food and service was good. Moreover, they charged 15% of tip without my consent."}
{"text":"First time to eat here and definitely not our last. Had a thia curry and thia basil both awesome. Great service and food a must on the way or from vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, every time we eat here (twice a month roughly). Orange chicken is one of the kids favorites, and it's always tender and perfectly done here. We made the mistake of trying the other \"new place\" in town that just opened, but immediately regretted it and came back to China Bistro."}
{"text":"Tiny buffet with decent food. Try the crab rangoons, they will not dissapoint. The woman that runs the place is hilarious and worth 3.99 for the entertainment alone."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. No rice with my lunch order, flat soda, waitress gave me the wrong soup, egg drop soup was terrible. Priced way too high from previous tenants."}
{"text":"Very fresh, amazingly tasty. Best Chinese food I've had since moving to Las Vegas 15 years ago. Great seafood and noodle dishes. Looking forward to trying the Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Nice place! Affordable prices, tasty food and very friendly personal! For sure - 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food here is very authentic. We ordered orange chicken and green pepper beef. Both plates are very delicious. The egg flower soup also good. Price is very reasonable and staff is very friendly. Highly recommend everyone to try it out."}
{"text":"Good taste. I can still remember the taste of kung fu tofu.Very nice suggestion from the lady who is serving us. Good vegetarian option.  We ordered kung fu tofu, veg lo main and vegetable curry everything is fish oil free. Quantity is good for three people and it cost us around $34. Will love to go again wherever in the city."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but won't be going back. We ordered 3 \"individual combos\" as it was stated on the menu. Came with choice of entree, soup, bbq pork, egg roll, and pork fried rice. Egg drop soup was litteraly broth and egg, ok no big deal. Appetizers come and it's 1 small piece of pork on a plate with a tiny egg roll about 1 inch long. Pork was tender and egg roll ok. Then food came, I ordered general tso chicken. Flavor was good. She brought one order of fried rice, about a 3oz scoop. Another lady came by and asked if everything was ok, i asked if we could have another order of rice because we ordered the individual combos and was only brought one side of rice.  She said they only bring out alittle bit at a time so it doesn't get cold and all I had to do was ask for more, they would make sure we had plenty of rice. I just asked for more and was not given any, but told I could have more, ok. After eating about half of my entree and wanting to take it home for lunch, I needed more rice, which I never got the first time I asked. When I asked for more rice and a box she said what do you want to take. I told her my entree which I had no rice for and my boyfriend's leftovers as well. She brings me 2 boxes. 1 with about 1oz of rice in it and an empty one. Definitely didn't get the \"plenty of rice\" I was told I could have after asking for more and being ignored."}
{"text":"My family and I think that the food here is great and the managers are nice and always cheerful.-Bella"}
{"text":"You must stop here for your lunch or dinner!  We enjoyed Mongolian Beef and Chicken Lo Mein for lunch today.  Both were absolutely delicious!  We were so excited to find this excellent restaurant on our road trip leaving Nevada and heading to Arizona.   The proprietor was also welcoming with a great sense of humor."}
{"text":"I had a flight to catch and I was driving from Kingman to Las Vegas. They were really quick and accomodatin. I can see myself coming back here again. Their wonton soup was on point and their beef noodle stir fry was as well"}
{"text":"The couple who owns this restaurant are some of the sweetest people i have ever met....I left a $12 tip because the woman went out of her way to take good care of me. The food is delicious also. Very authentic tasting which is something you cant find very often in Pittsburgh. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service and delicious food.  My husband and I are from Chicago and visiting Las Vegas.  We decided to stop here on our way back from the Grand Canyon because of the other reviews we read.  Definitely a great choice."}
{"text":"If you're passing through or spending time in Boulder City and are Craving Chinese Food... Then Please try China Bistro... Seriously, you will not be disappointed.  I Promise!  Angel, the server, and Jennifer thee Chef are very friendly and social.  Not to mention the Food... OMGoodness!  This is by far the BEST Chinese Food I have had in a long long time!  Seriously, I live in Tempe, Arizona and have not come across a Chinese restaurant that actually makes their food fresh, to order, fresh!  I am not kidding!  I am a Foodie of Asian descent and will call it as I see fit and I am telling you... you will not be disappointed... These ladies will make sure of it!  Five Stars for You!  Thank You for the hospitality and Delicious Food!  We will be back.  I highly recommend this place!  Thank You.  Frank & Sandi Spence: Tempe, Arizona"}
{"text":"Took the trip from Vegas to the Hoover Dam, after working up an appetite we did not want to wait to eat back in Vegas, saw this joint in Boulder City, decided to try it. There were no cars in the parking lot (that's how city people judge the quality), we went in any way, the food was cooked to order and very good, the service was exceptional and friendly, definitely worth eating at. Skip the Panda Express across the street"}
{"text":"I'm on my way back to home and pass this little Chinese restaurant. I stopped by and checked the Yelp! I'm very glad I did it! They offer pretty good Chinese food. I went by the server's recommendation which is sesame beef. The flavor is sweet and spicy as she states and the beef is very juicy! The sweet is a little more than moderate but the very little dry red pepper fines the entire plates an upgraded level! Definitely comeback and check again next time on the way to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really great food, I highly recommend the Orange Chicken. The newly remodeled restaurant is very clean and the staff is incredibly friendly. Also, the prices are very fair and well worth it. The new owners did a great job and I hope they keep up the good work. We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Love the food. My mum is a vegetarian and i was about the order Panang curry for her. The chef told us that the sauce had fish sauce in it. I never knew all thai curries have fish sauce. She was very considerate and recommended us to have yellow curry. We had chicken cashews, yellow curry and panang chicken. Each dish was delicious. Thai ice tea was perfect, it had the right sweetness.  I would def go back to this place when i am visiting vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, made to order dining. Very friendly staff. Even though I may eat here only once every few months, they always remember me. Being acknowledged and greeted with recognition by the wait staff makes for an enjoyable dining experience. Chatty and upbeat, the wait staff is always helpful in guiding you through their many dishes."}
{"text":"Superb food.   At a nowhere olace like this u don't expect genuine chibese and thai fare.   Prices aee very fair.    The food is just yum... Better than anything in little china in vegas"}
{"text":"From the time my family and I walked on China bistro the customer service was amazing. Our waitress was Angela she knew we were cold from just coming in from the rain. She gave us a round table in a corner that had a heater. Wow she made us feel at home. The food tasted authentic and the plates of food looked appetizing, and it was sooooo good. We highly recommend this place. We will be back the next time we come visit lake mead. Thank you Angela for the wonderful customer service, see you next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I always take my family here when they come to town and my sister lives it here.! I could eat here all the time. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone.. But when you walk inside it smells a little weird lol but I goes away"}
{"text":"This is a newly opened restaurant completely remodeled inside and out in the site of a former Chinese restaurant that just wasn't good -  so much so that I was a bit hesitant to try it out, but I'm really glad I did! First the restaurant is exceptionally clean, and very well done. You enter meeting the largest Buddah that I've ever seen. The staff is attentive and friendly. The dining room is small, but well laid out with both table and booth seating. I went with a group of 5, so I had an opportunity to try quite a few things and they were all excellent. Started with a couple of appetizers - Indian pancake  with a curry dipping sauce, and the Larb lettuce wrap - which came with an amazing Peanut sauce. For our entrees we had the bird nest chicken and shrimp, thai basil with chicken, pad thai, vegetable delight and the Tom Yum Noodles, each dish was cooked individually from scratch, presentation was excellent, and  each has its own distinctive flavor, and they were all fantastic! Plates were $9-10 each.  So finally we have great Chinese/Thai food in Boulder City and I couldn't be happier. I will definitely be back again and again. Wow!"}
{"text":"Very rude and unprofessional people with a taste for misdemeanor theft charges. Ordered $29.50 in delivery and was charged  $80. When I spoke to Angel (do not know real name she was rude and unapologetic). Attached is my bank statement to prove it. Fuck you China Bistro, I'M GETTING MY MONEY BACK"}
{"text":"This is a 3.5er. Pros-fresh tasting, no weird pieces to secretly spit into my napkin, and overall pretty tasty. Pieces are decent and service is maybe their lowest point. Friendly, but for how not busy or was I anticipated a little quicker, but it wasn't bad. Food was good, not the type of awesome I will say, oh my gosh I'm craving this place, but definitely good enough I will eat here instead of driving all the way into Vegas for something else and not feel disappointed."}
{"text":"Suprised me when in a small town and found a great restaurant. Foods are awesome..try it and be suprise."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best egg drop soup I have ever had. The staff is always friendly and whether your dining in or taking out the food is fast and excellent."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Freshly made!  Quiet atmosphere and very helpful employees.  Food servings are not big and it is not and economical place to eat.   I was surprised when my bill came and they had added a 15% gratuity for a party of 2 adults and two children."}
{"text":"Been here several times and this visit was extra GOOD.. Had the udon soup it was fantastic.   Place was busy, good to.see the little guys having some great customers.  Also had egg fun young.. it was great also.  Only one waitress she was doing a great job and the cook brought out all the food to each table as soon as it was done..  only one thing could have been better... my fortune in my cookie... it was lame.. ha ha.  Good food  will return"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past 4 months as a tourist.  No you don't need to drive all the way from the strip to try this, but yes, this will be a top choice for Chinese food if you are near Boulder City or on your way to Hoover Dam.  Great friendly attentive service, fresh ingredient, comfortable seats and the chef was a great chef from Hong Kong hotel."}
{"text":"We were craving good Chinese food.  we were disappointed. service was good. no ambiance at all.  the sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken was so sugary, we couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place given the other reviews, but came away very disappointed. Service was slow, but they were busy so that wasn't a big deal. While the Crab puffs were great, the entries were just too sugary (both Mongolian beef and Vegetable Lo Mein). We have never tasted any Chinese food that sweet (other than something like Orange chicken). Maybe it was just an off night?"}
{"text":"I did a delivery from them last week. Eveything that I got was delicious. My favorite was the wor wonton soup, pot stickers and moo shui beef. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Good stuff!  My family eats here about twice a month and we have yet to be disappointed.  Always great service and fresh tasty dishes at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"had a great meal there ordered it to pick up a lot to go perfect service as usual food was excellent, really AM an egg foo young connoisseur and this is the best I've had  sense San Francisco, little hard to get into the parking lot, but that's okay it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'm really glad we looked at Yelp I would have never stopped at this place without the Yelp rating. The food is awesome the service is very friendly and prompt will be back."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Lunch specials were fair price and came out quick. Delicious pad thai. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best chinese restraunt I have ever been to and have been to many in vegas. The mongolian beef amazing. Service and decor excellent. This place should be on t.v.. You must stop here or you're missing out. Best chinese in vegas."}
{"text":"As the only place to get Chinese in Boulder City, I'm glad it makes a 8 out of 10 on my ranking system. I've been there for lunch and dinner -- the lunch special is your run-of-the-mill combo plate. I'd like to see them provide complimentary hot tea though -- to me, hot tea with your Chinese food is like the free chips & salsa you get at a Mexican restaurant ... just sort of the experience.  The dinner was quite good -- maybe because it was family style, as most Chinese places are, and we could all sample a variety of things -- so that's probably what we'll stick to going forward. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is superb. Everything was made to order and extremely fresh. We have been here several times and have had a wonderful experience every time. It's the best Chinese food in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Excellent service! It was a treat to come here. I was getting tired of burgers and chicken and decided to have seafood; amazing. Good spot for a quick hot meal."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices.  My husband said it was the best hot and sour soup he's ever had"}
{"text":"The best place i have eaten in a long time. Very authentic and extremely friendly service. The food was so fresh. I would make the 45 min drive from Vegas to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly staff! Chinese family dinner special is the way to go. Min. 2 person, $13.95 each. Tons of food for a great deal. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new Chinese restaurant to try on a random weeknight.  The reviews looked surprisingly good for a Chinese restaurant in Boulder City, so we decided to give it a shot.  There were 3 other tables with diners when we arrived and a couple take out customers came in while we were there.  The service was quick, the food hot, and the restaurant clean.  I would not say the food was anything special though.  The soups and entrées were a little bland, but tasted fresh.  This is definitely 'Americanized' Chinese, but the price was right."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in all of the Las Vegas area. We live at least 45 minutes away and take trips out to Boulder City anytime we want Chinese because everywhere else in town is a let down. We have been looking for a good Chinese place since we moved here over 5 years ago and this is hands down the only place to go. We order the pot stickers, bbq pork, fried shrimp, fried rice, sesame chicken, and szechuan beef. All delicious and fresh. We have always gotten it to go, but if you live within their area they deliver."}
{"text":"They serve generous portions of what appears to be healthy food and the food is delicious. I know egg foo young is not authentic Chinese food, but their slow cooked egg foo young is the best i have ever had. Their shrimp and vegetables is a generous portion of large shrimp and vegetables cooked just right--still crispy, but not raw."}
{"text":"The place looks a little rough on the outside. Once inside you feel like a special friend. The staff were fun and helpful. We asked for Mu Shui Pork, which was not on the menu, no problem. The food was proper. Try it."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, food was good, it all tasted fresh. Best fried rice I have ever had. Great customer service, the waitress helped us order based off of our tastes and what we were in the mood for. We loved everything and will be returning. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is a cheap buffet. It is what it is. The noodles are good. The breaded chicken, such as General Tso, was not very good. It tasted like uncooked breading. I would be back if I wanted a cheap buffet lunch. I would only get grilled chicken though."}
{"text":"The reviews did not fail us. It was delish. Loved the garlic beans and they accommodated Kung Pao with broccoli instead of bell pepper. Flavorful and the right amount of spice. Lovely ladies! Don't let the exterior steer you away."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place in Boulder City for Chinese food!! My wife and I haven't found a better place!! Love the Staff!!"}
{"text":"This food was delicious! I ordered over the phone from the web menu as I had never been here before.  We chose house Lo mein and sweet and sour pork.  YUM! Food was fresh and ready fast. Not at all greasy. Portions were big. This restaurant is easy to find in the heart of BC. A nice choice for those of us here in Hendy on the other side of railroad pass.  Staff was pleasant and friendly.  I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a nice surprise! Very nice inside, friendly and helpful service. The food was fresh. They have a mix of Chinese and Thai dishes and we had a selection of them. The Pad Thai had sharp clean flavor, not the muddled taste of so many other places. The Pot Stickers were great. Freshly made and a nice balance of flavors.  Service was friendly. This is a really great little spot!"}
{"text":"Been many times traveling through while on business. Go here, it'll surprise you. Wonderful Chinese food from a great couple owning a local business. It won't disappoint you! Go and you'll understand what I mean. Orange beef, lunch specials and chicken dishes all very good. Highly recommend! Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese I've had since moving out west. The food was perfectly cooked, and so flavorful, yet the flavors were subtle and delicious instead of the typical sticky sweet sauce I've found to be common in most Chinese restaurants. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food!   We were with a person who had lived in China and he was very pleased with the China Bistro's food."}
{"text":"This is ok for Boulder City Asian food, but it's definitely not anything special when compared to a good Asian restaurant anywhere else. The service is not great, the food is not very flavorful and my picky husband said \"it just tastes like cafeteria food\". Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"New to the area from the \"Windy city\" in that their is a large \"China Town\" on the SW side there .. This place ranks better than any Chinese restaurant in Chicago .. With that the Thai  ? I only wish they featured Rama chicken .. I just might have to  suggest  this ?.. Anything on this menu just know it will be  \"top ten great \"  !   Believe it  !"}
{"text":"Super friendly,  will make food to order. Delivers food to my work as well.  Food tastes as good as it looks!"}
{"text":"First time using them. Food was good no complaints except curry had no tofu which I asked for and girl on phone said it would be no problem, driver had no change and I didn't have exact change either. I tip but not $10. I called them back to address my concerns and to find out what the mysterious $2 charge was on bill and got delivery charge, \"I usually ask if you need change but I forgot\", and there usually is tofu in veggie curry but must have been a mess up in kitchen\". Sorry. Ummm really that's it. Well sadly poor service and no remorse totally ruins it for me which is too bad as I would have gone back"}
{"text":"I don't know why my wife and I don't eat here more often. We live in Boulder City and even if we were from down the hill in Las Vegas or Henderson, this would be the go to place for quality Chinese food. I have been recuperating from oral surgery and chewing is out of the question. The server selected a noodle dish for me that was wonderful and she recommended a bowl of Egg Drop Soup. That was the best I have had EVER. My wife ordered the Phad Thai and it was the exact degree of hot spice she wanted. The chefs and server are enormously friendly and seem genuinely concerned that your food is perfect. As has been noted by others, the restaurant is squeaky clean."}
{"text":"The food was good...not off the hook, but solid.  It always throws me to order Thai food from a Chinese place.  But whatever.  The hot and sour soup was both hot and sour.  The chicken curry (thai) was tasty but not mind blowing.  The crab rangoons were pretty standard.    The reason I am giving this place four stars instead of the solid three it deserves is because I was ridiculously sick and even though the delivery guy wasn't on the clock yet, they delivered food to me...oh heck, I am giving them five stars.  For Boulder City, this beats Panda Express all day long.  So this is the place if you want Chinese (or Thai) food.  I haven't gone into the place yet, but I will when I'm not so sick."}
{"text":"Just opened and my husband and I had lunch there yesterday. Great shrimp Pad Thai, tasty and spicy chicken Panang Curry, and the hot and sour soup was a bit thick but very good. Staff was warm and welcoming. We will go back. Not too pricey, $20 for two lunch specials (including warm and crunchy egg roll) and tea. Clean, nicely decorated and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese food I've ever had...    very unique experience!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Heading to Lake Mead & needed to eat lunch. Yelp had such great reviews & pictures that made my mouth water.    Someone met us quickly for seating & drink orders. The server was friendly, quick & professional. Place is nice looking & very clean.   Hubby chose Lo Mein with chicken and I ordered Mongolian Beef. The Lunch menu came with soup: egg drop or hot and sour-both were excellent with great flavor. The lunches also came with an egg roll-crispy but mushy filling. The Lo Mein was outstanding with amazing sauce & tasty noodles. The Mongolian Beef had plenty of beef (so many places fill the plate with cheaper onion) in a spicy sauce. It was delicious-the only 'beef' (sorry) was it was a bit oily.   Would like to give it a 4.5-hubby says 5. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service is really good. The food is good too. We ordered one soup, one Mongolia beef and one tofu, it costs only 30$. I will definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"A good option for Boulder City dining, especially if you want vegetarian options. The menu here is quite varied, we like trying their many different choices.   I usually stay away from Asian restaurants which offer more than one country's cuisine, but the Thai choices are just as tasty as the Chinese ones.  Last night, we had egg rolls, Thai lettuce wraps (with tofu substitute for chicken), Mu Shoo Vegetables, Green Curry with shrimp and Ma Po tofu. All were excellent.  Another thing I like about this restaurant is that it feels very clean, which is unusual for an Asian restaurant.   The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"We found cockaroach in our food that was delivered! We called them back and asked for a full refund and they refused. Said they would only refund the dish it was found in!  Who would eat anything prepared their , after that ??"}
{"text":"We ordered for the entire office last week. Not only was it here in twenty minutes but it was hot, fresh and delicious! Daisy is so sweet and friendly when she takes our orders. We will definitely be back! Thank you Daisy!!  P.S. They DELIVER!!"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about their lo mein, so delicious, we met all their crew, from Angel the waitress, to the chef and assistant chef they were all very sweet. Chinese being one of my absolute favorite, this place did not disappointed, it exceded my expectations with delicious, fresh, and flavorful food. We will be back again."}
