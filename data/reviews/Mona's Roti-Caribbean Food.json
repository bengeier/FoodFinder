{"text":"Delicious vegetarian roti! The best one that I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Roti, and the portions are great. I haven't been this satisfied with my palate and my pocket in a long time.  And they have Pear-D!!! (Pear-D is a sparkling pear flavoured soft drink)"}
{"text":"Good selection of vegetarian dishes. Pretty friendly service. Must try the paloori with the spicy sauce (sorry don't know how to spell it)"}
{"text":"What a blessing to be here ..!!    what started to be a huge surprise when I enter sun-rise carribean place ( where my wife work close by) at Markham@ Sheppard .. the price was expensive and quantity was like a kid menu .. i was out of here ...  my mind came to my craving MONA\"S  I order my usual chicken boneless roti which was perfect balance of spice and flavor .. and the double (chickpea wrap) which my family love ..  What was huge disappointments was they did not sell ox-tail On Monday .... YYY ..   But no worries ,now I know ... Thursday here I come .. try the goat curry,it was awesome ..   This place has some hard working, caring staff .. I will keep coming back for more ..   Until we meet again .. I love u Mona :)"}
{"text":"Just went by yesterday for late lunch and ordered the chicken roti.  My friend ordered the jerk chicken.  I gotta say the jerk chicken and rice was delicious!!!  It was moist flavourful.  My roti was one of the better roti's i have around town.  It wasn't dry like I have had a most places.  I do wish there was more curry sauce in my roti, but I guess  they didn't want to make it soggy for me since I was going to have it to go.  The employees were wonderful and welcoming, they even checked to see if everything was good while we ate there.  If I wanted more curry sauce I am sure they would have given some but honestly it was pretty good anyway, just my personal preference is extra sauce in everything I eat.  Definitely would be going back for more roti and try their other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Went back today and got the jerk chicken roti and cassave pone.  Jerk Chicken Roti (around $7.50): It has potatoes in it (you can ask them to leave this out).  One thing I noticed is that this time the lady behind the counter did not provide one of those plastic boxes- not a crime really but when you are eating a roti and it has gravy in it, you really need something to hold it as a paper bag won't do.    Once she had put some potatoes in the roti she took pieces of jerk chicken and proceeded to separate the flesh from the bone (with gloves ofcourse). Then she added some gravy and some hot sauce - both of these are optional.  She said the jerk chicken was not spicy so I asked for the hot sauce.  I enjoyed the jerk chicken and would defintely go back for more.  One thing I noticed was that other people when they ordered the chicken roti asked for extra gravy. So after the ladies had wrapped up the roti they would pour some gravy on top.   CASSAVA PONE: I also got the cassava pone ($2.25)- its between a cake and a pudding and little more gelatinous. I like it, but I don't think the texture is for everyone.   PARKING: Got there around 12.30 on a weekday. Again busy but managed to find parking very quickly."}
{"text":"Mona's Roti is the place to be when you want your curry fix.  I haven't tried a lot from here but one thing that I keep coming back for is their Dahlpuri Roti skins.  Fresh, soft, LARGE (18inch) roti layers with crushed lentils in between.  You can also see the ladies in the back making these bad boys.  Accompanied with their curry goat, delish!  The service is fast and friendly but the place is small so its take out only."}
{"text":"One of the top two roti in the GTA. Amazing paratha roti, including special whole wheat paratha on Wednesdays which are absolutely worth the trip. Fantastic selection of curries, stew meats, and veggie dishes. And very generous portions, with friendly service. There is nowhere to eat inside but the food travels well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I only found this place on the recommendation of Yelp users and holy crap were they ever right.  This place is the real deal!  I had a chicken roti and my wife had a vegetarian one... we also took a couple of doubles which I think were totally demolished before we even got out of the parking lot, they were light, fluffy and delicious.  The roti's were very very good too.... we've been back a few times since and it's a bit of a trek as we live in Riverdale... luckily it's on the way home from the in-laws ! If you're big into Caribbean food I highly recommend this place... and the staff were super friendly too"}
{"text":"Hot fresh roti, yummy doubles, soft and delicious phlourie and always great customer service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed 2 doubles from this place. The doubles were a delicious snack and for $1.50 each you can't go wrong. The bara (flat fried bread) was a bit oily, but overall yum."}
{"text":"DELISCIOUS! !! AUTHENTIC!! Love to bring friends and show the how good rotis and doubles can be!!! May have to wait in line as it is small and popular, but worth it!"}
{"text":"k so the whole meal was like around 5-7 bucks for a dozen palori and sauce and a veggie roti,,, it was moist and sooo delicious... it had pumpkin in it... woow first bite and my taste buds were having fire works !!!!!!!!! i missed having roti sooo much...  usually all vegetarian rotis taste so bland and dry... and boring.... NOT HERE!!!  extra points for being in the same place as TEN-ICHI ! my other favourite eatery...  They should open  up more locations, because I don't live in Scarborough"}
{"text":"Mona's by far is my favorite spot for roti. Personal favorite is the jerk chicken roti. You can see them churning out the roti at the back. Taste so fresh! There's always a line-up.  I've also tried Roti Hut (also read great reviews online), but it's just not as good as Mona's. Their roti seems to be thicker and meats are less flavorful in comparison. It's still great roti, but just not as good as Mona's."}
{"text":"Hefty, well-stuffed rotis... these beauties will definitely cure any roti cravings you have. I don't normally dream of goat, but for some reason I was craving it this weekend and we dropped into Mona's for a dhalpuri boneless goat roti and a beef roti... and pholourie. I can't resist those tiny, greasy, tamarind dipped appetizers, even though I am guaranteed to be wearing them on my hips for the rest of my life. The rotis were soft, and stuffed with potato, sweet pumpkin and tons of meat, I have never had a better roti! Well done!  There was a sign on the wall saying they are looking for experienced roti cooks. This white girl from Nova Scotia thought about applying- they could pay me in rotis. ;)"}
{"text":"10/10 always.... this is the spot, no questions asked. Great roti... not a massive fan of the doubles microwaving but ya can't win em all."}
{"text":"They have a yellow sign. This place can get busy be ready to wait in line.  Food: We ordered 2 Rotis, for the vegetarian roti you have a choice of spinach, cabbage and carrots, pumpkin and channa dal (chickpeas). We had both of them with all of those. We also ordered a double (which is a fried roti with channa dal and tamarind sauce)  The roti was awesome and had two thin layers with cooked dal in between which makes it healthier.  This place is impressive it is like walking into a roti factory you can see the entire assembly line from the counter, they don't hide anything about how they make these things.  Drinks: They have plenty to choose from no alcohol available here.  Washrooms: I didn't notice that they had any.  Ambiance: The place is a factory of making these rotis so it can be a little loud but not unusually loud compared to most fast food restaurants. They have extremely limited seating only 3 tables, so be ready for take out when going here.  Service: The service was friendly and quick, if you've never been here before they like to offer suggestions.  Parking: There is lots of parking but this place is very busy during lunch and dinner, and you might have to wait 5mins to find a spot to park."}
{"text":"BF took me here - he brought me take out once from Mona's (before taking me to see Star Wars) but told me I had to come here for myself. There was plenty of parking however, this is definitely a take-out place. I think I only saw one or two small tables with chairs and it was probably there for people who needed to sit while they wait for their food...  There is a troupe of women making parathas and it was so cool to watch. I kept inching closer and closer to get a better view of what they were doing and received very motherly smiles of amusement.   The Doubles - 5/5 (I do not even know how to describe how amazing these double taste. You...just...have...to. And don't make the mistake of getting one... they are so light and the tamarind sauce is amazing.)  Chicken roti - 5/5 (PACKED...you need to share this...)  Parathas - 5/5 (comes in packages of 6)"}
{"text":"Very good curried chicken roti, worth coming by off peak hours to try out.  Don't think I would drive far out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Best roti in town. Dhall Puri is fluffy and nicely stuffed. Stayed soft for days after. Curry could use some work as it lacked flavour (tried duck and Chicken). It's my go to place for roti & dhall puri!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  Used to buy doubles and paliouri all the time when I worked in the area.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST! Flavour Price Service Portions  Expect to wait on weekends but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The curry chicken here is really good. In all honesty, I did not enjoy the curry goat unfortunately. The roti is also good, but not with the peas. Next time I will have to try it with rice. There are two small tables if you want to eat there but this is more of a take out place. Also they sell really good currant rolls. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"I have paid 2 visits to Mona's Roti. The first time was to try a double. I requested to have hot sauce and tamarind sauce on mine, and it was quite tasty. However, i disliked the fact that they microwaved it. I expected it to be made fresh. Oh well, at least it came out piping hot!  My second visit I tried the goat roti. The meat was tasty and flavourful, could have been a bit juicier, I found it to be on the dry side. The roti shell itself was also quite dry, unlike the ones at Island Foods. Nevertheless, the staff were really kind. The lady recommended I eat the roti like a sandwich (NO KNIFE AND FORK), and it totally worked out. She said this way, you get to bite into all the layers and get the true taste of the roti.   I will try the rice curry dishes next time."}
{"text":"Chicken roti with pepper sauce was quite good. I will have to try the jerk next. Doubles were just okay."}
{"text":"Very good experience for my first Trini place ever. I was stuffed with the big jerk chicken roti I ordered. It was very tasty. Cant go wrong with jerk chicken.  I went to the place with two friends on a Saturday. It's stuffy inside since it's just a takeout/catering place with only 1 or 2 tables inside. You can see the staff working hard from the counter.  The doubles was cool. The roti was very tasty and more than enough for myself to eat. I asked for spicy roti, but unfortunately it ended up not being spicy. There were also a bit too much potatoes.  There was a fridge inside the place that probably had Caribbean/Trini drinks, but I didn't buy any of those."}
{"text":"I love Mona's Ox-tail stew, as well as their jerk chicken and potato balls. It's a small joint so sitting in is almost impossible, I believe that there's only 1 or 2 tables. The staff working were very friendly and overall I had a great experience. I always come back to Mona's if i'm feeling Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for Caribbean food in the Scarborough and Markham area!!!  My GF and I finally found a place in Scarborough for good, authentic Caribbean food.  Their curry chicken roti, jerk chicken and oxtail were perfectly made, and service was friendly and excellent even in such intense environment (there was a lineup out the door!!!).....  Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for doubles!!! Have tried t find a comparable in the GTA and surrounding regions but this place has got the best doubles hands down."}
{"text":"I can't remember where, but somewhere, Mona's was rated Toronto's best roti. As I found myself in the vicinity of McCowan and Sheppard I thought I'd try it out.   The strip mall they are located in seems to have a number of tempting Indian and Caribbean food places. It would seem to be the one perk of working in that part of Scarborough.  They are very well staffed and friendly. I think they expect a lunch-rush. I got there after lunch and had the place to myself. The owner even sat down to talk to me. I wonder if  was giving off \"Yelp reviewer vibes\"? How embarrassing! I assured him that Mona's had a reputation on the internet as being kick-ass. He was surprised to hear this.  The vegetable roti was excellent and not greasy. The hot sauce was sweet and not too spicy. It may be the best roti I've ever had. It's in the top 3 anyway.."}
{"text":"the parking here is a mess, there's hardly any seating, and just barely enough room to stand while placing your order. Even still, I'll for sure be back.  This is a small place that packs a big punch. With a kitchen full of mamas, you know the food is going to be good. Roti is freshly made before your eyes in the open kitchen and wrapped around potatoes and your stewed meat of choice -- GOAT CURRY being ours (surprisingly - not the least bit gamey). It's served in wax paper and a paper bag so, while it's not exactly a breeze to eat from, with a little skill and caution you can still gobble it up, relatively mess free. The DOUBLES combine such interesting texture -- chewy/soft carbs sandwiching whole chickpeas in a tamarind sauce. Just over a buck, they make for mighty easy eating (except this is also served in wax paper/paper bag) We opted for the OXTAIL a la carte, to top things up and while there was more than enough food altogether, we regretted not having some rice to soak up the sauce. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"I went here after the lunch rush but before the dinner rush hoping to avoid a long line-up but it was still crazy-busy inside on both sides of the counter (it's an open kitchen with a lot of people making making various kinds of roti).  I also noticed that all the customers had heavy Caribbean accents which had to be a good sign.  I got some curry goat with rice & beans and some spinach on the side.  The curry goat was one of the better ones I've tried as the flavour of the curry popped a bit more than most other places I've been to.  I still had to add a lot of pepper sauce though.  But the food was fresh and the portions were good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab doubles $1.50 and potato balls. the shop is tiny and there is no debit/credit but its worth trying out if your in the area. Their chicken roti isn't to my liking (dry) there are better places in the area I usually just grab their snack foods as they are cheap, tasty, and hit the spot under $5. Recommended if your visiting somewhere else in the same plaza. Not sure I'd hunt this place down though.   Here's why:  The parking situation is horrible in this plaza as it shares with the Ministry of Transportation as well as a few very busy take out joints. Spots are tight every time I go there be wary of door dings. Also try to avoid prime times as the tiny counter gets hectic during their busy hours and there is hardly any room to move around while standing in there. The counter design is not smart. Having to order on one side and moving around the tight corner to pay only to exit back where u ordered causes a seriously bottleneck/traffic jam. They need to open the second door for exits to make a free flowing enter exit system. I only go during odd hours but if your gonna hit this place during lunch good luck ;)"}
{"text":"I've come here for the doubles and they're pretty good for a quick lunch, simple and tasty, but not my favorite doubles place by any means. They make really fresh rotis though so I've come here a few times to just grab them and make my own curries to go with it. Nice place for lunch or a quick bite if you're looking for a good meal for a good price, but not my go to by any means."}
{"text":"How good can roti be? It tastes pretty good everywhere, how much better can this place be? Amazingly better!   I've never had Roti like this. Ordered the beef roti, I don't like potatoes much but they cook it so tender and soft with airy wrap that has some type of power to add some really good texture to it. Beef was tender and cooked just right but when combined with everything else it's simply perfection.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review! You have to try it, never had roti like this before!"}
{"text":"Really delicious West Indian food!! It's located in a non-descript plaza so easy to miss if you are driving by.   I ordered the boneless chicken roti and also tried some of their potato balls. Both were very, very good. The place gives off a homey feel as there are several employees in the back cooking. Service was very friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"Scarborough knows that the best roti and doubles is here! The service is busy but patient loving and kind.  A home away from home for take out mostly. I love them."}
{"text":"The roti here is good. It's not my first choice when ordering roti, but it will do in a pinch since it's close to home. The curry dishes are tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Personally, I don't find this to be authentic Trinidad food. Full disclosure- I do have high standards coming from a Trinidadian household.  For me, the test of a Trinidadian fast food joint is the roti(on its own) and the doubles. As I've mentioned, the roti is pretty good. However the doubles are 2/5 at best."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Every bite of chicken or goat roti with tamarind sauce is tasty. I like the portions - they are just enough to fill you up, but you don't have to unbutton your pants."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had roti.  My friend was getting a serious case of the munchies after work, so we decided to stop by Mona's for roti.  We ended up sharing the Goat Curry Roti.  Unfortunately it was not boneless, but now I think I know why... Because cooking any meat with the bone on adds a ton of flavor!  The roti was nice and thin.  It is slightly more expensive ($8.75) than other places that I've been to, but it was worth every penny! There are only 2 tables of 2, so it's definitely not suitable for a crowd.  More like a pick up and go kind of place.  The owners were very friendly.  I enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"I their doubles, polhouri, and roti with chicken is great. Excellent taste. Always recommend for a quick takeout."}
{"text":"Line up out the door during lunch on a Saturday. Large staff for the only purpose of making rotis! Service was pretty friendly.   I ordered the goat curry on roti, doubles and plantain chips.   They gave me chicken curry for orders of roti and it was saucy at all and very dry from the crumbled chickpea. So they lose points on the dryness and wrong order. The roti itself was fresh and soft/moist.   The doubles were fantastic filled a chickpea filling and a bit of hot sauce.   The spicy plantain chips are phenomenal, I don't think they make them there but dammit they're tasty!   I would return and try the jerk chicken and ask for extra sauce. Prices were decent as well."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall off Sheppard Ave in Scarborough Mona's is a takeout only, Caribbean restaurant with a hefty reputation. It was clear by the line-up out the door on a late Saturday afternoon that this place was popular. As soon as you walk in the first thing you see is a bunch of ladies, and one gentlemen, cooking fresh roti's in an assembly line manner that would make Henry Ford proud.   When it came my turn to order I knew I needed to try the roti, so I opted for a goat curry roti. I quite enjoyed my roti which was consisted of a few interwoven roti's filled with potato and curry. The goat was quite tender and flavoured pretty well with an array of spices, I would have preferred if the curry had a little more heat but it was flavourful nonetheless.  The fresh roti was awesome, had a great chew and was easily some of the best roti I have had. I do have one complaint with my meal, the roti to goat ratio was not great, and I would have preferred a little more filling. Furthermore there was not enough gravy in the roti causing it to be a pretty dry meal, especially since the roti was layered pretty thick around the curry.   Mona's certainly knows what they are doing and I will be back to sample more of their vast menu. They do run some specials over the weekends and the duck curry certainly piqued my interest. This takeout joint is definitely worth a visit, if only for the heavenly roti."}
{"text":"Best doubles in Scarboorugh, best daal puri in Scarboorugh, best carrribean curries in Scarboorugh hands down! Went in for lunch today with a dozen hungry mouths in line. Food here is outstanding, perfect for lunch and dinner.   Chicken curry, bonless (hallelujah) with potato curry and carribean rice and kidney beans is just the bomb! I chose rise with my meal instead of roti, but looking at the dozens and dozens of fresh, hand made rotis, couldn't resist adding one extra to the meal. Puri stuffed with fresh daal, fresh and extremely soft. Miles better than the store bought with guilt. Huge portion, very filling and totally worth the price.  Lots of hard workers here who make some fantastic, heavenly food made with care and a smile. If you're in the 6ix, drop by Mona's for a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Mona's was Rock-n-Roll..i.n.g when we arrived with plenty of hands on-deck in the back kitchen rolling out an incredible amount of Fresh Roti Breads.  It was weekend dining hours so we got the orders and settled on one of their 2 Tables available for the random eat-in Diners.    All staff were quite Friendly, Accomodating and worked in unison between themselves and the Music(West Indie Vibe Music and some Michael Jackson).  They continuously worked the 1,400+ Fresh Roti Breads in the back while the others met with consumers thru the door to provide Curries, Roti Wraps, Roti Skins(Dahlpuri $2, Paratha $2, Whole Wheat options $2.25), Stews, and various other selections of Meal or Products...  Btw, that was the Trinidad Flag near the Register.  Goat Curry Roti(Bone-in)  - Delicious even prior to a dose of spicy sauce.  The Roti Skin does make a difference.  Good mix of ingredients.  Enjoyable.  Afterall, the name of the place is \"Mona's ROTI\".  Stewed Chicken  - Looks of a good mix of ingredients however I found it lacking flavour to other versions elsewhere.  Served with Rice & Peas as one of the $6.99 \"Special of the Day\" it's considered good value to comparison of styrofoam portion offered.  3.5'd"}
{"text":"Have to say, unexpectedly good! Pros: Amazing food and rotis, can see what's happening in the kitchen Cons: Only take out, confusing to order for the first time Overall the food was so delicious you shouldn't really care about anything else!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, Mona's is TOTALLY worth the hype. Everything is amazing.  Everyone below me has said everything, except:  1. GET THE PAHLOURIES. Little dough balls. Ugh so good. Comes with a tamarind dipping sauce.  2. Get the POTATO BALLS. They are spicy. Same dippign sauce as above.  This is a popular lunch joint for me, love it.   The roti skins are phenom.  The gooooooooooooaaaaattttttttttt  The chickeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnn  Notes:  1. There's no seating 2. Everyone here is SUPER AMAZING. LOVE YOU GUYS ALL FOREVER."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best roti I've had in the GTA.   Super fresh with a nice tasting curry and generous portion. I've had more tender goat but it was still very good.   The doubles were just okay but I'd definitely return for the roti."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  I've never had a bad meal at this place. Staff is really friendly too. They've ruined all other Carribean restaurants for me because no matter where else I eat now, it's never as good as Mona's."}
{"text":"This is a Trinidadian takeout out joint which I've heard many goods reviews from people. Today I visited for lunch. You enter from the door facing the parking lot and are greeted by the hot counter and menu board. You can see a large counter behind with all of the freshly made roti. You place your order here and then make your way over to the cashier. This place is tiny and meant only for takeout, although they have one table at the front of the store with a few chairs. It gets busy here at lunch and dinner time! I ordered the boneless goat roti and the portion was huge, as with most Caribbean places. The dhal puri was great as was the goat and potatoes. There didn't seem to be a great level of base spice in the goat. I had hotsauce added to mine but it was still not very spicy. Perhaps more is needed if you like it hot. I will definitely return and also try their doubles next time."}
{"text":"I'm no roti connoisseur, but this place hit the spot. We ordered 2 jerk chicken roti's with a coconut water and ginger beer for ~$30.00   The meal was satisfying and the food was very fresh. If you like spice you can ask for extra hot, as the hot sauce wasn't the spiciest. Overall a good meal. The ginger beer was my only disappointment-it was too sugary for me.   The vibes here are really good as well. They have good music playing throughout, so you can enjoy that while you order and eat."}
{"text":"Portion is becoming less. Food tastes good. Parking sometimes is hard to find at the plaza. Not really a good option to dine in due to lack of space and tables. Order curry chicken Bone in or boneless, or stew chicken or beef. All taste good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great little shop in a busy little plaza. Always lots of people which mean the foods good. delicious"}
{"text":"Mona's roti for lunch was the best thing I could ask for a yummy meal. Being a vegetarian, we got two different types of rotis with all the curries.   Two roti variations (a) Dhal filled roti (Slightly sweet) (b) Plain roti  Curries (a) Mango curry - delicious. Really hit all the right spots in sweet-sour range. (b) Spinach curry - okay (c) Pumpkin curry- good (d) Chickpea curry - average (e) Cabbage curry - average-good (f) Potato curry - average  Equals = 12 yummy individual variations or plenty of lovely combos.  We had a fun time combining them all for a meal at home. Vegetarian roti combination costed $15+ tax. We got three different boxes to mix and match and had a feast at home. Portion size was good and we were filled after the meal.   Overall when the curry and rotis were put together - it was a delicious combo : roadway to food heaven if you ask me. This was my first experience with Trini food. I think I will be baaack for more soon! It's fan-tastic yummy filling food.  Remember - it's cash only and you will need to eat somewhere else. (We got it back to a friend's place)"}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout lunch from Mona's after reading the glowing Yelp reviews and hearing from a friend that I had to check them out.  There was a short line up and the few chairs within the restaurant were occupied.  So we grabbed our food (a curry goat roti, a curry shrimp roti, one double, two coconut waters), which came to $28, to go.  Our respective rotis went down quickly and left us both satisfied customers.  I personally would've liked a little more curry, more hot sauce (surprise, surprise), and less potatoes.  I'll have to make my preferences clear the next time I order.  The double left a little bit to be desired given the hype surrounding it, but I'll certainly give it another chance.  The coconut water, which at $3.50 was not cheap, came half frozen and was very refreshing.  Also, the woman taking our orders didn't smile once or give us any form of acknowledgment, which was mildly off-putting."}
{"text":"All a matter of what you get. All these positive reviews are praising the Roti, which is handmade and you can actually see them working on it in the back. Impressive, but my low rating is attributed to the dish that was less than.  Mona's is a small Caribbean restaurant on Sheppard between McCowan and Markham Rd. The place itself is tiny, and they seem to be strictly takeout. The hot counter was where I was looking, where they had a variety of curries and stews. You can find goat, chicken, beef, or just vegetarian options.   I came because I wanted to try their duck, but they didn't have any, so I stuck with poultry and got myself the stewed chicken combo with rice. The stewed chicken itself was pretty dry and I thought a bit bland, despite how spicy the chicken was. The rice and beans were also dry which didn't make for a very enjoyable meal.   Now I'm sure if I ordered the Roti, this review would be much different, but I didn't. I;m definitely going back to try one and will probably update then. But until then, I know I've experienced better."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good I want to just lock the door at the shop and make it my personal buffet. One of the best West Indian spots in the GTA. Can't beat the roti. I live away and have my mom send me some roti skins via express mail."}
{"text":"True West Indian Curry & Roti. Be sure to have the Dahl roti... It's done right! This is the closest I've had to my Granny's home cooked."}
{"text":"4 pm on a Monday no line. Food was good but the girl serving was so rude/sour. We won't be going back. I work in the service industry and the experience is important to me doesn't cost anything to smile."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when we walked in was how busy this place was. It gave off a very homey and your friendly neighbourhood spot vibe which I enjoy very much. We came here for the roti, so we ordered a boneless chicken roti and the lamb with rice. Very compact place, so I'd recommend getting take out.   Since we were not experts in Caribbean dining, I loved how friendly and helpful the staff were. As we were checking out, the girl asked if we wanted to add doubles to our order. I declined at first (I really had no idea what she was talking about) but good thing she carried on to explain what it was. Sold me instantly and it was the best decision I ever made to try them.   The roti was a tad bit dry for my liking, but the chicken was good. I especially enjoyed the lamb with rice because the rice was done just perfect. I would recommend getting the hot sauce on the side because although I didn't try it, my boyfriend said it was super spicy and he's normally a spicy food eater. If there's only one thing that I can recommend for this place, it's the doubles. Must get the doubles.   Service - 5/5 Food - 4.5/5 Value - 5/5  Environment - 3/5 Overall Experience - 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I love their roti's, and their line of roti bread manufacturing is pretty impressive.  Double's! Mango tamarind and pepper. I love their doubles! Tamarind is delicious, the pepper and the mango are my favorite. YUM.  Goat (bone in) is fantastic! Check out the other reviews, they also say the same thing about the goat. Very tender and tasty.   Beef stew at some times has been tender, and other times not too tender, but is always nicely flavored. Not my favorite dish.  The curry chicken is really good!  Try a Peanut Punch. It's like a peanut milkshake with spices. Really good."}
{"text":"This place is a bargain. Lots of good food for not a lot of money. Doubles, roti, anything on rice and peas, it's all good. We'll definitely be coming back as often as we can."}
{"text":"My coworkers claimed it was the best roti in town. And I think I agree. Cheaper than Ghandi Roti, i thought the portions were larger too! Curry to roti ratio was perfect. I just thought the filling was lacking something though that's the only reason I gave it one star less. Would definitely try again"}
{"text":"Didn't know it was there, first time found couple of months ago and go back anytime I'm in the area.. very friendly staff.."}
{"text":"Went during my exam break so didn't want to try the roti or double for the time. But the boneless chicken An rice combo was so nice! Good portions as well. Chicken was nicely done and flavourful. same as the rice.   You might have to wait a tad but worth it)"}
{"text":"No matter what time of day it seems like this place always busy. Its a really small place and almost 100% takeout. When people are standing in line it usually fits about 10 customers max and every time I'm here the line out is out the door. They really need a bigger place. When you actually get inside you can see like an army of works making the food. So far I have tried their oxtail rice and peas for $8.99 and the boneless chicken roti for $8.50 I think. I found the oxtail to be a bit on the salty side but overall pretty good. Still doesn't come close my moms homemade oxtail :) The chicken roti is amazing though. Really moist tender chicken and they don't hold back on the meat. After finishing one roti I always crave another one and I'm sure I could polish off 2 of these in one sitting. Challenge accepted!"}
{"text":"Firstly, the staff here is soooo nice! They went above and beyond to advise what they enjoy, make sure all our needs were met & even ensure to personally greet and say bye to their customers! They also serve very quickly, so the tight space isn't that much of a worry.   We ordered two meals, which you can get either with rice or roti. The rice comes with a side of vegetables & the roti comes with dhal and curry potatoes. One we got with jerk chicken (roti) & the other ox tail (rice). The jerk chicken wasn't that flavourful, in the roti at least. The curry potatoes and dhal was too overwhelming. Good size though. The ox tail wasn't great either. The rice, even with the curry, was bland. The potatoes weren't anything special &the oxtail had a lot more fat than meat."}
{"text":"My favourite Caribbean joint! It's our go to. It's fresh, delicious, authentic and great spice. I ask for a special jerk roti with jerk sauce and pepper.... The best !  I crave their food ! The jerk is definitely best in town. Only four stars because the wait. There's always always 90% of time a line up ( not suprised ! ... The word is out) but the place is small so if it was winter... As good as it is I will not stand in line that long outside (I have stood as long as 30min. ). What I have their jerk 10/10 , my favourite ! Fresh, moist , and extremely flavorful ! The goat and rice 9/10 and chicken stew 9/10 and the paratha 10/10 again they make it fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"This place is always packed whenever I drive pass it so I thought I give it a try, came on a Thursday afternoon around 3pm and there was a bit of a line up Mind you this is a hole in the wall place with like 1 table, when you enter you get a big wisp of curry which smelled good....they had a sign talking bout the history of this place back in Trinidad in the 60s....I was starving and had high expectations for this place but in the end the food wasn't as good as I had thought  Ordered the curry chicken boneless on rice & peas and 1 roti...curry chicken wasn't as spicy as I thought and there wasn't enough sauce....the roti was sooooooo messy but maybe we were doing it wrong but I still think other places are better...even Costco roti is better  Maybe this is authentic Trinidad food but I wouldn't be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Mona's Roti, well known place in Scarborough. Not that hard to miss, corner unit. Wouldn't recommend to eat, small seating area. Better for take out.   Tried the Jerk Chicken....  Rice- option for white or brown rice and peas  Jerk Sauce  Asked for hot sauce  Option for 1 side - went with potatoes   Overall It was good, for a quick take out option. Nothing over the top but its okay. Hot sauce wasn't hot, tasted mild in my opinion which is good i guess to cater to all types Chicken was well cooked, great seasoning you can taste it in the skin. Rice was good. But overall was a bit dry, but for for $8-ish its a good meal. Overall Ill give it a 4 based on the jerk chicken, and general environment of the place.   Got to try their other options as well."}
{"text":"The roti was good but it wasn't worth the stressful and negative experience.  The staff was curt, and behind the counter it was chaos which led to very slow service."}
{"text":"Okay, you know how when you discover something that you wished you knew about a long time ago and the regret that you wish you had done it earlier?  You know like buy 5 houses 30 years ago, invest in Apple or Google stocks, mine a bunch of Bitcoins?   Well that's how I feel about Mona's Roti....why didn't I come before!!!!  Every time I drove by especially during lunch or dinner there is always a line up out the door...whenever you see line ups like that it means they are doing something right.  When you walk in the first thing you notice is the army of hard working women pumping out the rotis like no tommorrow!  Each and every roti is made from scratch and by hand.  They rotis are not store bought and you can taste the difference as they are soft, chewy and flavourful.  I ordered a boneless chicken roti along with a double (dahl puri) and they were both awesome with the roti filled with chicken, channa (chickpea) and potato.  The only thing was that I asked for extra spicy but it wasn't spicy at all but then again I'm a chili head:). The double was filled with channa and a hint of tamarind chutney.  You can also get the meat with rice but the roti is the real star here so I recommend you try it with the roti first.  There's only a few seats for eat in as the place is more set up for take out but do it eat it soon as it tastes so good freshly made!  Will definitely be back to try all the other items.  Oh man I wished I bought that Spiderman #1 comic when I was a kid!!"}
{"text":"Best doubles in Scarborough, possibly all of Toronto. Very very limited seating, and you will have people hovering around if you choose to eat in. So get your stuff and bounce!!!  They also have amazing dhalpuri and potato balls, im not a vegetarian, but if I was i could live off Monas (they do sell meat, curries, fried fish etc as well)  The parking sucks so, yeah prepare for that."}
{"text":"Been going to Mona's for years.. this is my go-to place in Toronto for true West Indian food.  This isn't fast food.. this is home cooked goodness.  I always grab a few doubles and a curry chicken with some paratha.. everything is so fresh, my mouth is watering just typing this out.  Tips: this is a pure take out place! No seating.. enter on the left, order.. pick up your order and pay on the right.  My favourite part is watching the ladies in the back make all those paratha.. you walk in and it smells like mom's house.. or at least.. somebody's mom's house.    Ok.. you're not West Indian.. but you have a Trinidadian friend from school.. and you used to go over to his house to play Super Nintendo.. and you're really excited because you've been wanting to check out Super Mario World because you beat Super Mario 3 but always felt World 9 was missing something.  But instead of playing SNES, you walk in and his mom offers you some doubles and you forget all about Mario and Yoshi and the cape flying thing.. you eat til you're stuffed and you say \"Thanks [friend's mom name]\".. yeah, that's the mom's house that this place smells like.. and her name is Mona."}
{"text":"The rotis here are one of the best I have had and I grew up in the area so I've had my fair share.  There's a couple spots to sit and it's more of a take out spot but it doesn't matter. Eat it in the car. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"The \"go to place\" for your Caribbean fix.  The roti's are fresh and fluffy (you see them making them in the background).  The food itself is VERY good and lots to chose from.  Reason for the 4 stars is because of their lack of seating (take out only)."}
{"text":"Best roti in Scarborough for sure. Though chicken curry usually has fat pieces on it. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I had the boneless chicken wrap and doubles. The rotti was good , the chicken curry had too much turmeric - was not a fan . The doubles was good. Will definitely try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Have eaten lots of Caribbean food around Toronto and this is one of the best. Got the jerk chicken roti which screamed freshness, not too surprising since this was made to order including watching the lady hand pull the jerk chicken. The dhalpuri (ground split pea) roti shell is super  fresh and soft, almost like facial tissue. The chicken was tender and had great jerk flavor but I wish it was just a tad stronger. Maybe it's cause I asked for her to add chicken curry gravy (most places do this upon request) to add another dimension of tastiness. Another specialty of this place, which I haven't seen at many others, is phoulourie. They're basically a larger, savoury, Trini version of Tim Horton's Timbits.  One order has eight of these fried dough balls and is best eaten with the included sweet and spicy tamarind sauce. This place can be hard to find, but it's in the same plaza as the Timmy's, and facing Sheppard at the outer edge of one of the inner buildings. Also, note this is purely a takeout place. Should you go? \"Yuh seein dat\"  Rating: 5 Tamarind-flavored Iced Capps out of 5"}
{"text":"I have tried many different roti places, claiming it's authentic like back home. Only to try it and find it is not like back home.   Tried Mona's based on the good reviews here on Yelp and found it to be fantastic. The roti skin is what makes or breaks a good roti and let me tell you, this was delicious. I have tried the boneless chicken, potato and channa, and goat with bone. They were all great and so tasty. The portions are very fair and the price is not bad.  They also have a few things from the West Indies, like tamarin balls, Mauby, Trinidad Orange Juice, etc.   I have found my Roti go to place."}
{"text":"This place is normally packed. Which isn't a problem, but it's the staff that make my visits here painful. It's unpleasant dealing with them as their customer service skills are just terrible. The food is ok. I won't be going back here for a while... if ever."}
{"text":"I just love small take out restaurant like Mona's Roti-Caribbean Food!!   Now Now.. you know why freshly made Roti tasted so much better... especially when I watching them making right in front of me!! Not doughy at all... and even it was thin, it wrapped and kept the tasty curry goat in place...   You did not read wrong.. I am eating Curry Goat Roti and definitely enjoying it! Nice and tender hmmm not goaty at all?!! Tasted better than chicken!! I am converted!  Stewed Chicken though on specials was just MEH! When anything that reminds me of my own cooking is MEH!! The chicken reminded me of chickend cooked in soya sauce.   When the staffs know that we were eating in.. they put the styrofoam in the microwave to heat that up for us! ......hmmmm"}
{"text":"Probably the best roti I've had. So good! In case you aren't aware, it isn't a sit-down kind of restaurant. More of a... grab some roti and go. My mouth is actually watering just thinking about it.. I think I'll go grab a curry beef roti right now! (not even joking)"}
{"text":"Mona's Roti is legen...wait for it...dary in Scarborough. The owner's picture is all over Sheppard East's sharesheppard.ca ad campaign, and rightly so. Mona's awaken your every senses. There is an Henry Ford-like assembly line of hairnet-wearing roti experts (possibility one of the finest roti progressive assembly in Scarborough). Fresh roti is hand-crafted on a heavy cast iron skillet. There is absolutely zero comparison between pre-made frozen rotis over hand-made fresh off the skillet rotis.   The boneless curry chicken roti ($6.64) and jerk chicken ($7.52) are a party in your mouth. It was tender and moist with the right amount of spices. The roti was fantastic with a great chew! The addition of curried potato completed the roti!   For $1.50, Mona's doubles is a bargain. Doubles is a common street food in Trinidad. It is a sandwich made with flat fried bread (known as bara), filled with curried chick peas (known as channa). Bara is made of flour and ground turmeric. It is then flatten and fried until golden brown. At Mona's, the doubles was top with tamarind with a dash of pepper sauce. It has excellent filling-to-bun-ratio!   Thank you for serving up delicious authentic Trinidadian food, free from hair contaminates!  ;)"}
{"text":"Mona's serves real Trini food.  I spent ~4 weeks in Trinidad and the only thing missing here is shark & bake.  Everything I've tried here is on point, just like I had down there.  They even have doubles!  Not quite as good as the ones I had out of a 5 gal bucket by the airport at 6am, but pretty close.    They have various meats, fish, rice & beans, and other Caribbean dishes.  They also have Sea Moss, Peanut Punch, and a bunch of other Caribbean beverages.    This place is takeout only, cash only, and has daily specials.  It's really cheap but worth twice as much.."}
{"text":"Sometimes I hit up national sports on my lunch break, and if you've ever been to that national sports, it's got some basic b food around it. Coras? Does it look like I want some suburban food?   A quick yelp search turns up roti hut, but then there is this place. Oddly enough, I've been to this extremely busy strip of food mall whatever autobody lot you want to call this, but not mona's.   There were at least 5 ladies whipping up some rotis for the dude in the grill. I ordered a boneless chicken with hot sauce (might've been too hot for my white guy enjoyment) roti which was just so darn fresh. Probably the best roti I've had. Let's just mark it a 5."}
{"text":"We had a meeting at the University of Toronto Scarborough and ordered catering from this restaurant. The food was excellent. Service was very professional. We'll definitely use them again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was craving jerk chicken and seeing as Mona's probably has the best in the city it was my first option. Food is delicious, roti is fresh and service is fantastic. The lady working there was one of the sweetest people I've met. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I expected more.  Curry was tasty and portions were good.  Not the 'over the top' quality I was expecting.  Arrived around 7pm so maybe the reason the food was mostly cold.  Mango curry was good but again I'd rate as average.  Staff was very friendly, helpful, and nice."}
{"text":"I finally recently got around to trying Mona's roti and it was delicious!!! I wanted the oxtail but by the time I arrived there at 1pm, they were already sold out. I ordered the goat roti w/channa and the jerk chicken roti w/pumpkin. Needless to say, we devoured it all and it's really filling.   I like how they give the option of what toppings to have it with as I am not a fan of potato and have been to other places where there's more potato than real meat. The place was packed with the lineup out the door but worth the wait. Really friendly people behind the bar!  Note: They're closed on Sundays."}
