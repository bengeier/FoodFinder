{"text":"Dover Pizza is a great little local bar with thick, rich pizza. The restaurant side always bores me, but the bar side is where the action is. Locals pumping their change into VLTs and playing bad music through the jukebox. But the staff are always pleasant and make you feel at home. Although it doesn't look like much from the outside, the food is good and there's a great local vibe that isn't too depressing. I've always enjoyed Dover Pizza and never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"I go to Dover Pizza to eat steak.  I have never had a bad steak here, and go specifically because I always have a good experience.  Their ceaser salad is also great.  It is dated and small, but well kept.  The owner is very nice as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food was great and the staff were very attentive. Went for my grandma's birthday and the server went above and beyond! I will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the world. I grew up in NYC and currently live in Philadelphia. Every time I visit Calgary I make it a priority to get Dovers. Hawaiian is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Dover pizza since I was a little kid and I'm 19 now and still love it just as much as I did then! The waitresses are always friendly, the pizza is delicious and so are there most of their other dishes. Their French onion soup is to DIE for, you HAVE to try it if you stop here for lunch or dinner! Will Definately come back :)"}
