{"text":"I was here last night for dinner with my husband. I am a chef and worked with one of the servers over 15 years ago at Pronto. I decor was average and very dated. The salt and pepper shakers on the table looks like they came from a garage sale,  the plates were well worn,  and the paper tablecloths should have gone out with the 80s. 
We ordered the pate platter it had chicken liver pate, pork rillette, Sliced deli ham and thick sliced Sopprasatta. It was $16.95 and vastly overpriced for the quality and preparation involved. We could not even eat the pork because it was so old, dry and had a huge piece of cartilage right in the middle of it. When asked by the server how everything was I said 'just okay', the plate was barely touched, we were still charged!
I had the rainbow trout special with Mediterranean sauce and rice.  Fish was fresh and well-prepared, vegetables raw and inedible. My husband had the steak freak on the menu (should be signature dish) Same inedible vegetables, limp, soggy frites, No housemade jus or gravy of any kind,  Just a very plain compound butter on a very plain New York strip.  Steak was watery in flavor, tasted like it might have been frozen. 
Coca-Cola was out of the gun, also had terrible taste. Despite the fact that I knew the server he was very inattentive, we sat way too long with half eaten plates, just wanting to get out at that point. had to ask bussboy.
Bill was $100 with one alcoholic beverage, one appetizer and two mains. I will never ever go back to this place.
I cannot believe it is still in business given how hard it is to make a go of it.
I went on the restaurants website to see if I could email these complaints privately, but there was no such email available."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  service.

Food was just OK . . . Kind of pricey for what you are getting."}
{"text":"NEW RESTAURANT NAME AND OWNERS!!!  Now called Pain Perdu as of April 2014.
They kept the same phone number."}
{"text":"I Ate dinner here the other night with my fiancee and father-in-law to be and I was pleasantly surprised by Steak Frites. Overall the service was great, the food was good, and the price was very reasonable. 

My fiancee and I shared the escargot for our entree. The escargot themselves were very nice and tender. The sauce was exactly what you would expect, a lovely mixture of butter, garlic and herbs. Vampires beware. 

For my main, I had the duck confit, which was a steal at less than $20. The duck showed good technique, with crisp skin covering a juicy piece of leg meat on the bone. The vegies and potatoes that came with were equally well cooked. My fiancee and future father-in-law had the tagliatelle and mussels, respectively. Both of them really enjoyed these dishes. However, I think the tagliatelle is an odd thing to order, or to even be on the menu, at a french restaurant. 

The portion sizes were very appropriate and left us with not quite enough room to enjoy some desert. Next time, I may have to forgo the escargot so  I can try the chocolate mouse or lemon tart.

Since we live down the street from Steak Frites, this just may become our new neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Great food. I particularly enjoyed the mussels.Veal was delicious. Even though not full the restaurant was loud though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the wife. In the neighbourhood so was hoping to love this place. Unfortunately, it was just OK.

Decor / atmosphere is fine. Generic \"french bistro\" but not annoyingly so. 

Wife had the escargot, which was OK but had to ask for bread to be served with it -- thought this would be automatic. I had the pat√© which was a huge portion, and was also OK (but I've had better store-bought) and served with a nice salad with absolutely no dressing. Mains were both really fatty. I realize duck confit is supposed to be so but then why drown the veg and potatoes in butter, too? I had the rib steak -- really fatty and overcooked. Ordered medium-rare but nary a pink bit in sight,

Service was very corteous. Can't complain.

Overall an OK place but there's better in the neighbourhood. I should mention that the price is quite reasonable. Hopefully we just caught them on a meh night,"}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

I was so gushing about this restaurant last night...I had intended to give it 4 stars. Then, I did my spa/swimming day today and had lots to think about...including Steakfrites Bistro (nerd I know!)

This restaurant is beside the Milagro Yonge St. location and my friends initially wanted to try Mexican. But because we all have tried Milagro before, and I was actually feeling for some French Bistro food, Steakfrites was the obvious choice.

The interior is signature Parisian Bistro (chalk board writing, Edith Piaf music in the background, black and white tile floors etc...) We were walk ins and that wasn't a problem. The restaurant is actually very big, but we were given the \"walk in\" table...aka the one beside the bathroom.

The menu contains your signature escargots, duck confit, STEAKFRITES, calamari...I opted for the Escargots which were the worst I've had. My friend, who never tried snails before, said it best; \"it tasted dirty and grainy\" My bf had the Calamari which was nothing exceptional.

Specials of the day included the rack of lamb which my friends really liked. I had the duck confit (one of my fave dishes to order at a French restaurant) and I'm not sure how to think of it. It was so tender, and absolutely delish. But the skin wasn't crispy!! I thought duck confit was supposed to be all about the crispy skin. In any event, the tender meat-off-the-bone made up for it.

Dessert was nothing special...my bf and I shared the apple crepes which had apple sauce instead of the real fruit. By the way, at this moment, I believe we are going through an apple shortage?

French wine's aplenty and reasonably priced ($30-$40 range). 

Service was, as another reviewer put it, courteous so no complaints there. 

I can see this as a local spot for those in the area, but for me, it's not a place I would continually come too. Having said that, if you're ever in the same predicament as we were deciding between Mexican and French, perhaps you should try this place. The food IS good, just not wow."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place driving on yonge st. one day, so we thought we'd pop in.  We had just returned from Paris so seeing this place brought back good memories and has probably influenced this review.  

The decor of the place is pretty simple and neat, and service was professional and knowledgeable. My wife had arctic char with rice and a side of shrimps.  The sauce for the shrimps was delicious and made for a nice dressing for the whole plate.  I had veal with tagliatelle pasta in a butter cream sauce.  Like most french cuisine the taste was butter heavy and very rich, in other words amazing.

For dessert we had a plate of fries with mayo, haha.  The fries were delicious, double fried with nice homemade mayo.

Lastly, the pricing here is excellent. Mains averaged around 16 to 20 dollars which is on the low side for this type of dining.  Our bill with a bottle of wine and mains was around 80 dollars.  So if your looking for a nice evening out without dropping alot of money, check this place out."}
{"text":"I was hesitating to write a review on our visit to Stakefrites, but reading some of the negative reviews I have decided to submit my experiences.  After reporting in the past on some of our Toronto dining experiences, and reviewing the numerous comments submitted, we came to the conclusion that any experience reported could depend on the background of the writer and any hiccups or emergencies happening at the restaurant on that day and hour.  We all have different tastes, for example, I found with my European background, the sheep's eye served at my welcoming dinner put on by the Saudi Royal family not very appetizing, to say the least.  Regarding some of the comments on the serving staff attitudes, may be the establishment tried to emulate authentic restaurants in France, where the serving staff attitudes sometime are bordering with rudeness.      
This was our second visit to Stakefrites, as we were so impressed with the food, ambiance and service.    We had Liver Pate, Arctic Char, Calf Liver, Steak, Veal Normande and all were excellent, not to mention the Chocolate mousse.  The server was rushed off his feet, as the place was full, yet he was polite and efficient.  Prices were OK, little higher than the average charged in many of the Toronto restaurants, where in our opinion the food was mediocre at best, but you get what you pay for.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend and ordered two escaroles to start, I ordered the Fillet mignon and he ordered the veal medallions. 
I told the server I have an allergy to onions and can not have it on anything with onions. 
After waiting 50 Minutes our escaroles came. Mine was covered in onions. Another 10 minutes later a new one arrived with no onions, by this point i was starving, I tried to eat it and burnt my mouth so i kept stiring it untill i found a long curly body HAIR! The Main cources came and my $32 Fillet Mignon that was supposed to be medium rare was well done and solid like a hockey puck with no sign of red.

This has to be one of the worst restaurant experiances I have ever had, We could'nt believe everything took so long and could be that bad, when we got there there was one other couple in the restaurant which left before we even got our food. 

We also noticed they were filling up pints of beer and bringing them to the kitchen. DRINKING ON THE JOB!

After all that. The still proceeded to charge us full price for everything."}
