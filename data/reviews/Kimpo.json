{"text":"Great food and coffee!! Love love their Vietnamese coffee :) so rich and creamy Timmy and Starbucks coffee is nothing compare to it! sometime i go just to have the coffee! it earns the fifth star!  The place is really nice and clean with really comfy seating. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. has a good selection on the menu. I usually have the pho house special since it has variety kind of meat ( a no brainer for someone who can't decide what to have..) The broth is flavourful and always come really HOT!   The spring roll is different from the other usual spring rolls and i like the texture. Must try the mango salad if you are lucky enough to get some. so refreshing!  One the days that i want something more spicy, I would have the spicy pork hock spicy soup. full of wonderful flavour and they use a different noddle in this soup. the port hock is nicely done cook enough that is not too hard to chew and still have a nice texture. feel really satisfied after finishing the bowl.   they also have super good lemon grass chicken with rice. never know how to cook with lemon grass so i am really impressed with the nice lemon grass flavour.  wonderful place to have a quick lunch or family dinner at a really good price."}
{"text":"Kim po!! So another branch of Kim Po Vietnamese restaurant has opened! I saw the advertisement in a magazine the other day and decided that I should check it out as I've already been to almost every other Kim Po and my past experiences were pretty good which is why I decided to check out this new joint.   My first impressions as I entered the restaurant was that the place is very new and clean.  I'm pretty sure its newly rennovated. So as I entered, I was welcomed by a young waiter who was fairly friendly and he seated me inside the inner tables because he said it would be warmer. Thank god because that day was freezing.  So coming into this place, I already knew what I wanted. House special Pho. So i ordered the pho and an avocado shake. It was delicious. The soup was just right, not too salty nor too sweet.  Its hard to come across pho places with the perfect broth. I didn't walk away with a dried out mouth like many other pho places, so I know that they didn't drench their broth with MSG. The avocado shake was good, maybe next time I'll try the mango shake or maybe even the durian shake.  Overall great experience! Service was great, food was great. I recommend any pho lovers to come."}
{"text":"A great local spot! I've heard about this place for a while and decided to go in today to try it out. Since I was alone and live around the corner, I did take out, which at first I was a bit skeptical about only because I've never taken pho to go. But the service was great!  My order was ready in less than 10 minutes and the server was very pleasant. The decor in the place was very clean and simple, just right for a small pho joint.   I ordered a small rare beef pho and Vietnamese spring rolls which were both probably just a dollar more expensive than what I'm used to, not a big deal. The spring rolls were delicious: crispy, crunchy, fresh ingredients and well prepared. The pho was about average... although I've never really had \"outstanding\" pho, it's just a really basic dish in my opinion, hard to screw up. The soup wasn't very oily which I liked.   The packaging to take it to go was so well done, I know it's a small thing, but I really appreciated it. Noodles and soup separated, and included all the usual pho fixings like lime, mint leaves, sprouts and even a fairly portioned container of oyster sauce and sriracha!   Overall very satisfied. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best and favourite pho place in town! Their portions are huge. A small could pass for a medium and I can never finish their large in under an hour. The waitresses are very, very friendly and service is usually very quick. The broth is really good for those who enjoy a sweeter broth. The beef pieces are extremely large and there are lots of noodles. Also, it's cheap! 6.50 for a small, 7.95 for a large. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"as much as i really really wanted to like this place it was just too outstanding in its mediocrity. Everything is so average I have to finish this write up fast before I forget I actually ate here.   The pho and springs rolls were just passable, just good enough to be named pho and spring rolls. Its a Vietnamese restaurant but they had one thai dish, pad thai. Having one unique item means it has to be good right?....  wrong!.. it wasn't. it was below average although I did appreciate the serving size and the side of grilled chicken with the noodles.  Can't comment much on service as we were the only customers when we entered. Couldn't complain about the attentive server.  In summary, this is a kind of place you go to if you just want a Vietnamese fix, its the nearest restaurant, and you're too lazy to drive a few extra kms."}
{"text":"OK. So this place kind of caught me by surprise. I life around the area so i occasionally go to this plaza with the T&T supermarket to do grocery shopping. It seems like it appeared out of nowhere. One day a Kim po opened up in the plaza. Me being a fan of Pho and have had other Kim po's before, decided to try it. The place seems very new and clean so that's a good start.  I ordered a house special small. It came out in about 5 minutes. It was everything you would expect in a Pho.  Tasty broth, good noodles, tonnes of beef and great portion size; i was full and satisfied with a small. Wonder who can really eat a full large portion.  In the end im quite happy with this place. I no longer need to drive all the way to yonge and steeles to get some Pho i can just go around the corner."}
{"text":"They serve slow and ask you leave if you stay over 2 hours. And force you pay at least 15% tips"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends who are from Brossard on a Sunday night and what I understand is that this restaurant recently opened up.  The place is newly renovated and it's quite spacious inside. The cuisine here is \"Korean\" BBQ and sushi restaurant and the format is an AYCE.  Likes most Korean BBQ AYCE places they're not usually Korean, but rather Chinese establishments so the wait staff can totally take your order in Chinese, no problem.  Also, it's better to make reservations as it can be busy in the evenings. The tables have a built in grill and a vent to exhaust the oil vapours but be forewarned, you will smell like wonderful grilled short ribs and meats by the end of your meal. It's unavoidable but totally worth washing all your clothes and showering after eating there. Hence, think twice before going there if you have to wear the same clothes to another event right after! The wait staff are quite helpful and they come by often enough to assist you in changing the parchment on the grill. (Speaking of which, they're not there to strike up conversations with you but give you what you need to a good meal.  Some people would say the wait staff aren't friendly because of that, but they're by no means rude.) I've noticed this parchment grilling being the newer style used at these places as it reduces the need to change grill plates and for the kitchen staff to scrub the heck outta them. The down side to this is that it takes a bit more effort to get good grill lines. Grilling tip: If you want the vegetables you're grilling to taste good, grill the meats first (eg short ribs with the fat) so that adds oil to the parchment before placing the vegetables on the grill.  Once the parchment turns black and smoky, it's time to change and use a new one! The portions are good and there's enough variety in the foods offered there as well. There's a difference in the weekday and weekend prices because they offer more variety during the weekend, like grilled seasoned lamb chops! Those were pretty amazing and they're pre-grilled for you to a medium rare, but you can always throw them on the grill for a meat more well done. The sushis and sashimi (weekend only) were quite well-made and with enough variety to complement your K-BBQ. Drinks are available to order but the plus is that it's a BYOW establishment.  You can bring your favourite alcoholic beverages to pair with the sushi or grilled meats and nothing tops that because the SAQ is right next door! Back to the food, I would say there's enough variety to keep everyone happy and the table grills are quite within reach of everyone at the table. The meats were well marinated and don't need further seasoning but in case you do, they have a salt and pepper pot for you to add a touch of extra to it. Overall, since it's a new restaurant and they presented a rather good effort in decor, service and food choices I'll give them a 5 stars for that. It's bringing a bit more of the Greater Toronto Area Asian food culture over here as this has been very popular there for years. I've eaten at multiple Korean grill houses and this is up to par with them, keeping in mind that it's an AYCE/buffet so it's not a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating going to this restaurant for a while (I had noticed it before the official opening), I peeked inside from the window, it looked appealing and 'modern'... So today I decided to go, as I arrived the waitress had wiped her nose with her hand, she assigned our seat, the tables all had streaks of grease, the stainless steel above the grill wasn't clean, the bathroom soap dispenser in the woman's washroom was broken.... at this sight we decided to leave. Cleanliness should always be a priority."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Above average for the meat selection but far from being the real deal if you're into true Korean bbq. With the SAQ nextdoor make good use of your BYOB option.  Let's leave room for a better review... Need more banchans, gochujang and garlic!  Shame on you for not having enough fried icecream..."}
{"text":"Kimpo is a pretty well known Vietnamese restaurant around the GTA! I am quite surprise there was a location right on Yonge and Weldrick, right where the new T&T! I went to buy grocery at T&T and saw Kimpo, I went in right away with no hesitation. I walked in, the place looks really clean, that's always a good thing. On top of that the service was amazing, the people are really pleasant to talk to, and quick service. My order was processed and cooked within minutes, and the food just as expected from Kimpo, it tasted amazing! I will highly recommend anyone to go to this location or any other Kimpo to eat!"}
{"text":"Food there was okay, service was good, but it was too expensive, much more expensive than other sushi/kbbq AYCE restaurants."}
{"text":"Well, well...what can I say?  Any restaurant that gives me an upset stomach in a form of a diarrhea (sorry, I know this is too much information but goes directly towards their food quality and preparation standards, so please excuse the vulgarity and read on) deserves a big fat zero but since we can't rate any place a zero on Yelp, I'll have to be generous and give them a 1 star.    Went to Kimpo for the first time this afternoon with the hubby after reading good reviews on Yelp.  Unless the management changed since the last posted review, the food was terrible.  Like one of the reviewers said below, \"it's barely a pho.\"    We ordered a small pho with rare beef and tripe and a small pho with flank brisket.  We also ordered a cold spring roll to share.  First of all, I'm not sure what a flank brisket is, is it flank or is it brisket???  Either way, our cold spring roll arrived and it wasn't the standard shrimp, noodles, mint and shredded pork filled variety.  It was served with some sort of fish sauce which was barely edible.    Then our pho arrived.  I have to admit, the portions were huge!  Their small is equivalent to most places' medium.  We tried the broth first and right away could taste the MSG.  The star anise and cinnamon were also very strong in the broth.  Normally, I don't mind the strong spicing but when it comes to pho, I prefer a well balanced broth.  Due to the overuse of MSG in the broth, it tasted pungently sweet.  I had to squeeze in 3 lime wedges just to be able to eat my pho.  Generous portion of noodles seemed to have sat in the bowls too long since they were still stuck to the bottom of the bowls after sitting in the broth for a bit.  Perhaps we should have just left them without finishing our meal but we felt guilty for leaving so much food behind so we ate our meal quietly, paid the bill and left.    On the way home, both the hubby's and my stomach were growling so loud and needless to say, we couldn't get home fast enough.  Yup, most places I have poor experiences in, I'll usually give a second chance but this is not one of those places.  No thank you."}
{"text":"Usually when I visit a Vietnamese restaurant I don't expect to have good services, I just expect it to be clean, quick and cheap.  I walked into Kimpo with the same expectations and I am pleasantly surprised. The storefront just look a little old and dated for a new place? But the inside looks brand new and clean.  The waiter is the most attentive and friendly one I met at a Vietnamese restaurant and I been to quite a few. He anticipated my needs even before I know what I need?! I was the only one in the restaurant so maybe it would be different if the place is busy.  House Special Fukein Noodles Large ($7.95) - Chicken Soup base is nice and savoury... not oily at all... looks clear but has great flavours... So good on a cold day - Wish for more yellow noodle, seems to have a huge portion of vermicelli - Vietnamese Sausages missing and only have a few piece of pork - garnishes are nice with tons of chives and green onions - The deep fried shrimp chips would be so much better served separate since it got all soggy when I start eating it  I asked for fresh chili, my waiter came back with 2 types: Thai and Scotch Bonnet.. saying he is not sure which one I like  While the Scotch bonnet  bringing tears in my eyes, he got me another napkin without me asking...   I definitely will be coming back to Kimpo as there are not too may good decent Pho places in the area.. and I need my Vietnamese food fix often!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. Go to Mon Ami instead. I went early on a Sunday after hearing good things. The restaurant is large and spacious, with booths lining the side on one wall and many rows of tables filling the rest of the space. I was escorted by the manager to a booth in the very back, despite there being many tables and other booths available. I asked kindly if I could sit at a table instead,  as many were available and I am severely claustrophobic in booths. The manager denied me, claiming ALL the tables were reserved. I explained again that I am severely claustrophobic and surely there must be one of the at least 20 or 30 tables that is not reserved, but he would not change his mind. I explained how insensitive this policy was, and left, which seemed to make him all the more happy. STAY AWAY. There is plenty of other good Korean and Japanese."}
{"text":"Three of us went for lunch, and we had bad diarrhea in the afternoon. We can't figure out exactly what dishes caused the problem but freshness is definitely not what one can expect from this place.  Will not go again, and do not recommend it to anybody."}
