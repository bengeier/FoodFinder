{"text":"This place should have 5 stars.  The family that owns this place and works there is A Class.   The son is well trusted with the store!  That being said... they have THE BEST PHILLY SANDWICH IN THE WORLLLLD!  Thanks, guys :)"}
{"text":"For anyone that may buy gas from the Shell Station/Food and Things on Chaparral and Granite Reef.. PLEASE RECONSIDER!!! They are a horrible company with no compassion or professionalism. A couple of weeks ago, my grandma stopped to get gas from there. When she went to remove the handle and start pumping her gas.. the gas sprayed everywhere, because the lever was stuck. It went all over her, the car, and the ground. The gas burned her skin and ruined her shoes.. not to mention she was charged for all of the gas that continued to pour out of the pump. When she contacted the owner, he gave her attitude and did not bother to apologize. It took my grandma calling Shell corporate, to get refunded for the gas and money to buy new shoes! Please think of this and my poor grandma before you ever buy gas from there again!!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood and I love this place. It's so much more than a gas station. Their sandwiches are killer, great variety of beers, friendly people. Booze is a little over priced but they will gladly order what you request and keep it in stock if you request it."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at this gas station and have been for years. Everytime I go there they are always friendly to me and they know what I need. They carry all varieties of alcohol and have all different kinds of delicious food. I always recommend this gas station/convenience store to all my friends and family and none of then have ever been disappointed with their visit to food and things/Shell."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! Nobel Romans Pizza is a Midwest place and it really is amazing. They have individual pizzas hot and ready during lunch time. The cashier, who I'm assuming is the owners son, is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Rude, abrupt employees.  On July 10, 2014, I received poor customer service.  I called the store and asked to speak to the manager.  He would not be in until after 2 pm, I was told.  I asked for his name.  At that point, the phone disconnected.  I called later in the day, and in a flippant way, I was told the manager was not in.  No wonder the employees are rude.  They lack adequate supervision.  Merchandise and gasoline are overpriced as well.  Stay away."}
