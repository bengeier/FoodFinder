{"text":"Their weekend brunch special is real good. Paya, Nihari and halwa puri all for $9.99 buffet!! We've also tried some of their food from the regular menu and its been good. Service is decent as well."}
{"text":"Please be warned if you decide to eat at this place you are doing it at your own risk. The food has no taste. I cant cook but I guarantee I can cook food better then what they served. Not only that the food is over priced. You have been warned"}
{"text":"The food quality is good but the ambiance is not that great... good for take out...
Had tried veg biryani and Dal makhni.... Biryani was good.. but Dal was oke sort of..
Non-veg I heard is better..."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Fish Pakoras...Menu says $6.99 each..Bill says  $20plus...When asked the question owner says price changed..lol...change your prices on the menu or atleatlst apologise for the incorrect pricing."}
{"text":"I love their curry dishes and the Biryani. This is one of the best Indian/Pakistani restaurant I been to in recent years. 
Try their Paya and Halwa Puri on the weekend."}
{"text":"The owner and staff tries to charge extra and hide items in your bill to dupe you. I have personally caught them twice. I would've commented further on food (Nothing good here either), but the dishonesty alone overshadows the whole experience and makes one wonder what other nefarious methods are being used in the Kitchen where the customers can't see. Even though the resturant has changed hands multiple times, The current owner will probably run this resturant into the ground. Fraudulent staff and bad food. Avoid!"}
{"text":"For $12 all you can eat breakfast buffet. Good deal.

Buffet supposed to start at 10:00 am, but was delayed by 45 min. As we we're waiting..... 3 star for that reason"}
{"text":"We went for their halwa poori breakfast. FYI The sign on the outside is incorrect- it says $9.99 for halwa poori but it's actually $11.49. The halwa poori without eggs is $7.99. Otherwise, no complaint on the prices. The food was inoffensive. It tasted fine, the pooris were huge and greasy but not in a bad way. The potatoes and chanas were ok too. I mean, the nature of halwa poori is greasier-than-normal, right? That's why it's such a treat. The place itself is decent looking, and staff was quick to serve, but with the exception of the person who took our order, their attitude bordered on resentful, uninterested, and rude. I wouldn't go back. I'm sure there are friendlier places with more exciting food."}
{"text":"this place is such a rip off. i should have read all the reviews here before going. other are totally right about this place \"mistakenly\" inserting items you didn't even order.

the food quality is sub par and certainly does not worth the price you pay for the food.
the owners and the kitchen staff wears no gloves, cleans the table bare hands and then serve the food with the same hands without even washing their hands.

the staff including the owner inside the huge glass walled kitchen can be seen eating food with their hands and then making food for the customers.  the owners can be heard and seen very loud in the kitchen and on top of that the most pathetic thing is that right in front of the cash register they have setup a round table for themselves where the owner and the friends sit down chit chat and drink tea and talk extremely loudly about personal matters and business dealings.

i would avoid this place at all the cost. 
 on the good note i must say that one of the owners with trimmed beard (older gentleman in late 40's) is very pleasant person. but that means nothing.

food ordered: naan, chicken tandoori, chicken biryani, nihari, chicken kabab. all tasteless. especially the nihari which they are very proud of is completely watered down curry mixed with some boneless beef pieces.

verdict: do not waste your hard earned money here. save it for Tim Horton's next door."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Pakistani food. This is the place where you want to go. This is how I am going to rank things which I tried.  1 being the best

{"text":"The Best Pakistani Breakfast in Canada. They need to work on their service but the food is amazing"}
{"text":"This place is good, the food is delicious and the prices are decent not the only down side is that (this probably the case with 95% Pakistani restaurants) they usually burn the back of the naan. When dark circles of charcoal like burn sticking to the back of the naan or \"roti\" as Indians would call it. Other than that... food is A+"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant today 
1.Start with service very slow needs 15 min to serve one bread
2. Over expensive as 1 person Adult 9.99 plus tax kid 5.99 buffet and if you need extra Nan or Puri will be charged 1$ each
3. Taste is average puri soggy with oil halwa is OK Nihari average 
4. Pop would u believe each cost 2$ yes 2$ each can total rip off
Please don't visit as total waste of money"}
{"text":"Decent curry joint if you're in the area. Zaffran is located in a strip mall so it's not very fancy looking from the outside but it seats 60 - 80 people and the decor inside is nice.  

It seems to be a family-run Pakistani restaurant. The service is decent and the bbq grill is visible through a large glass window. The food was very good. I had the nihari and nan which was recommended by the staff. 

It's not high end but they're doing a good job over there. I'll be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with friends for breakfast buffet, price was $11.99 and for that you get Halwa/puri, pays and nihari breakfast with unlimited Paris & naan.

Taste was good and they were able to handle large crowds at a time. Place is small so got kind of tight with large number of people, however the wait staff were fast and responsive.

Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday buffet, tasty food and reasonable price . Recommended for food lovers :-)

Tried Nihari, Channa Masala, Allo bhujiya. Loved it ."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Chicken kata kut and Bihari Kababs are our favorite. We also have them do a special spicy biryani for us which is awesome as well. We generally get catering when we have parties and have never had any issues with quality of food. 

Only thing to watch out for: maybe they are busy but earlier we had some miscommunication with respect to details around the catering order. Simple way around that is to get everything in writing. 

Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Might only be good when they have specials. But way way too over priced for their quality of food. Their zinger is 6.99 dollars pricier than the original kfc zinger and no where as good. The chicken in one of the zingers was under cooked got sick, I wondered how they under cooked it considering the fact that it was just a slim barely 0.5 cm thick. Might be nice d√©cor but food not worth it."}
{"text":"Not an expert in Indian and Pakistanian food (obviously), so I'll try to describe it the best I can. 

Got some chicken curry (ghee?) that was pretty spicy. It came in your typical curry bowl, with heavily spiced sauce and lots of chicken pieces inside. It was slightly on the oily side. I prefer to have my curry spiced as much as needed, so it's more authentic. Naan was one of the best I've ever had.

Service on the other hand was sooooo slow. Took forever to get us seated, and took forever for us to place our food. I didn't mind waiting for the food since the naan tasted like it just came out of the oven."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously slow - I called in 20 mins before to pick up just 8 nans and I've been sitting here waiting 15 mins. Meanwhile all staff are cooking a catering order with no one at the front to seat or welcome customers. The guy is even eating while he cooks, NO gloves, no washing hands. I've come here many times in the last and the only things that is consistent is not the good but the time t takes to get it. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I was surprised, when I walk in .Great atmosphere, bright and clean, Everything was incredible!!!!!!
service was awesome!!? I would go there any time, I have not eaten this kind and cooked authentic, like I was in back home. Great job my friend I am not that easy to please, and with being in the same industry, I have very high standard bars . You are worth 5 +++ stars . Your warmth and great customer friendliness sure helps with customers coming back to this place ,The karahi chicken was awesome it was superrrrrr."}
