{"text":"Went here yesterday (Sunday). Ordered pork souvlaki and fish & chips to go. The new owner and his wife started to make what looked like a feast.Both were performing a well timed food ballet. Oil heating up , freshly made batter,salad and grill prep all jelling.I quickly asked if I could only have the fish & chips to go instead of both items. First came the Greek salad and garlic bread. both generous and obviously fresh.,yum yum.Next the pork souvlaki with roasted potatoes and rice arrived,home-style portions and such flavour. This is a restaurant that has it right. Comfort food served comfortably. Well done."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place twice now (both times through JustEat) and I've been disappointed both times. 

The reason this gets 2 stars as opposed to 1 is because the food was decent.

The first time I ordered I placed my order around 8:00 PM since I was hungry and it said delivery would be maximum one hour. An hour later nothing, but I decided to give them another half hour because shit happens, you know? I work in the food industry and sometimes things happen that are out of your control. 10'oclock rolls around and I decide to call them. Turns out they hadn't even started on my order (they gave a very vague reason for this) and said they would have it out in 15 minutes. At this point I was starving. Long story short, it took them another ~1hr. I ordered my food at 8, expected it to arrive by 9-ish but I didn't actually get it until 11:15 PM. 

Second time I ordered was today. Placed an order for the Family Dinner (Whole chicken with a side salad, potatoes, rice, and garlic bread). I called them as soon as I placed it to confirm that they had received it (didn't want a repeat of last time) only to be told that they only had one piece of half a chicken left and if I wanted a whole chicken I would have to wait one hour for them to make it and then an extra half an hour for delivery (the last part is understandable since the roads we're horrible). First, the portion is what almost made me laugh in disbelief. The chicken was fine. I mean, it was a whole chicken, so at least that part was honest. The salad could maybe feed 2 people. The rice and potatoes could be distributed in smaller portions I suppose, but it still wasn't enough to feed a family of 3. The garlic bread.. it was basically four small slices of hard and stale bread smothered in grease/oil. Two of the slices were the size of a child's outstretched hand and the other 2 slices were half of that size. To top it all off, they forgot our drinks. I usually don't order drinks for delivery but since we didn't have anything at home except for tap water I decided to. When I tried to call them afterwards (multiple times) nobody picked up. 

I'm just overall disappointed with their service. The only reason I ordered from them was because my mom wanted a quick dinner and I recommended them by saying the food was good last time I had it (sans the wait time) and she was disappointed in the final result, which kind of sucked. I don't think I will be ordering from them again. They say third-time's a charm, but this girl ain't risking it again."}
{"text":"This is a small Greek diner. They serve grilled chicken, souvlaki and deli sandwiches. I had a chicken souvlaki on a pita and it was terrific. My husband got a chicken dinner and it came with a big greek salad in a separate bowl. The  prices are great and you can really taste the charcoal grilling. The service was also very nice and friendly."}

Really great secret neighbourhood place to get GREAT food at a ridonkulous price.

My fianc√© discovered it and we have gone back again at least half a dozen times in person, and ordered delivery via TasteAway too.

Cheaper than a rotisserie chicken at EITHER of the closest grocery stores (Loblaws on Musgrave and Metro at Danforth Shoppers World) when you get the Family Meal Deal - For $22.99 you get a whole (beautiful) rotisserie chicken, big portion of gorgeous roasted potatoes, big portion of extremely yummy rice, a large Greek or Caesar salad, and 4 pieces of garlic bread! $2 for delivery. YES PLEASE!

Staff are shiny and friendly - our suspicion is that it is family-run. Tastes and feels like love is one of the main ingredients. 

Neon signs in the widow are hilarious!

My favourite veg main is the Spinach Pie - HUGE portion again, accoutrements (roasted potatoes and seasonal vegetables like corn on the cob, broccoli, etc.) are delish. Can't go wrong for $7.99!

If you eat in (not much room), you will be served in courses which is a nice touch.

If you order a large delivery, you'll most likely be surprised with a free extra like dessert! :) It's the little things!"}
{"text":"Had the roast chicken dinner. The dinner came with roast (pan fried) potatoes, a dinner roll and a salad for $9.00, pretty good value for the portion you get. The chicken was season Greek style (I don't know what that really means)...but it was flavourful and tasted delicious. My only regret is that I ordered white meat, so it was a touch dry. Their Greek salad was good. I would say at least if not better than what you would find in Greektown. 

This place is very small and has only a few tables, so takeout would be your better option. The interior could definitely benefit from a renovation as dated and divish come to mind when trying to best describe this mom & pop gem. 

Would I go back? Yes definitely! Would I recommend it to others? Yes, IF you are not the type scared of by how a place looks and if you want some decent proper grill chicken. My final thoughts... Support local restaurants and be adventurous!"}
