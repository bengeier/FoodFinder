{"text":"Really new approach to Italian food in Toronto, small portions contribute to more variety going through the courses. Service is excellent and the sommelier's recommendations were all 100% on point. Will def come back soon!"}
{"text":"I really wish this place was better. I'm having a hard time deciding whether this is 2 or 3 stars. On one hand, I was able to eat maybe 2 things on the menu, due to there being dairy on every dish. And they were integral to every dish. My apologies to my friends sharing plates with me. On the other hand, the atmosphere is cozy and fancy feeling, and the service was absolutely fantastic. They did everything they could with my dairy allergy.   We started with the deer carpaccio, which was undersalted and very earthy tasting. There were chocolate shavings that went with the dish that I couldn't have, but what I did have was bland and just tasted strange. I love raw/rare meat, so this was a surprise to me. My friends were pretty unexcited about it as well.  We had the seafood pasta, and someone said \"where's the rest of it?\" right when it hit the table. Oof. It was seriously a half portion of pasta. For sharing. So we each got maybe 5 noodles. The pasta was undercooked, well before al dente. The sauce and seafood were decent but didn't make up for the pasta.  Next up was the beef brisket, which was just disappointing. I could describe our piece as chalky. And the sauce, which had a huge description in the menu, basically tasted like a red wine glaze.   For dessert, everyone had some kind of dairy thing and I had the almond sorbet. It was good, not great. Kudos for having something that wasn't a simple bowl of fruit!  We also had the \"friendship coffee\", which is a seriously delicious coffee that comes in a kettle-like thing with many spouts. You pass it around with your friends and take a sip until it's gone. It was boozy and good. A total highlight of the night.  All in all, plates were very small and fell short of my expectations, particularly since my friend that invited me has been ranting about wanting to visit for weeks. It's also really pricey for the quality and quantity. The dairy-eating people may have a different experience, but this is a skip if you can't eat cheese or cream."}
{"text":"Small tasting menu size dishes. Fav dishes were the shrimp sandwich & seafood linguine. Do not recommend the steak - it was so charcoal that you couldn't taste the meat and was bitter. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate Valentines and I couldn't ask for a better experience.  We started off with the Linguine de Mare which was our #1 favourite dish. We thought that the seafood really came out in that dish. The carote was definitely something different - the taste of freshly toasted carrots with a bunch of crisped lentils on top had great texture. The Scrigno is a must get for cheese lovers as it bursts with what I'd call a tangy flavorful rustic cheese. My second favourite would have to be the burrino (mozzarella cheese with goat butter and anchovies). I don't even like anchovy and I liked it...  Dessert was great but I honestly don't enjoy sweets as much. My girlfriend said the meal itself was so good that the dessert was just average in comparison.  Service is impeccable - the staff make you feel welcomed and have friendly suggestions. As we walked out to get our coats, the bartender was introducing us to a really intricate coffee that they make.  All in all, an amazing dining experience. Much thanks to the Il Covo team for providing such an amazing night out."}
{"text":"Il Covo, where do I start? I had the privilege of experiencing this new resto in Little Italy last week, and what an experience it was. Each course was an incredible orchestra of flavours and textures, and it was a truly unique dining experience. Congratulations and thank you to everyone at Il Covo!"}
{"text":"Was pretty excited for this new Italian resto that specializes in Italian small dishes and hand made pastas. But.. had a mixed experience starting from the dishes we had to the ambiance and dining service.   Il Covo means the hideout which I think is a pretty accurate description as I felt like we were are walking into a stone cave dimly lit with red lighting but a little too dark imo. They have an extensive wine book (and I mean book because it was 100+ pages with full pictures and descriptions) So if you love a large selection of fancy wines, this may be your spot.   The dishes are half portions so the suggestion from our server was around 4-8 dishes PER person which I thought was pretty intense. We wanted to order 6 dishes for 2 people but felt pressured to keep ordering more to \"better time the sequence of the dishes coming out\" rather than asking how much we had an appetite for. So we ordered more food which turned out to be too much for us..  What I liked: -Grilled lamb rack - the favorite thing I had that night. The lamb was juicy and tender and beautifully flavored. The potato one the side was nicely seared and really soaked up the flavours. -Tomato grilled black cod - light and refreshing flavours, the cod was buttery and served under lots of tomato and olives.   What fell flat: -Linguine di mare: seafood flavours were there but the linguine was a tad too al dente. Also for $16, the portions were really just a couple mouthfuls.. -Insalata liquida aka liquid salad? This was highlight recommended by our server that would wow us and be bursting with flavours.. unfortunately wowed I were not. I love a good citrus zest but it was just too sour and overpowered the whole salad which consisted of roughly 5 lettuce leaves..  -Burrino - goat butter in mozzarella with a side of anchovies. I was really excited for this one. The bread was nice and warm but the butter inside the mozzarella is a great concept but for me personally was just too fatty and lack a strong flavour profile.   Overall 3 stars in my books because even though I did enjoy their meat dishes, I was not as much of a fan for their pastas and veg dishes. Also, the price points looking at the menu is reasonable but adds up very quickly because portions are small and you end up ordering a lot so be prepared to spend a pretty penny."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5-star experience (1).   Il Covo has a non-descript entrance so if you're not paying attention to the address and counting up/down diligently it's easy to miss. Remember: 585 College St.  Walking in, it's a visual feast. I confess, I'm a sucker for d√©cor. So many details to appreciate in Il Covo.   After some friendly banter with the waitress, she offered the tasting menu ...which is GREAT because it's been a long week and I am decisioned-out. I just... want to eat and have it be good! Note that this is \"Venetian cicchetti (Italian tapas)\" style so: half-portions aka small portions - 1 dish per person. If you're like me... and just like trying a few bites of a lot of things - perfect portions here at Il Covo. Btw, there is an in-house sommelier who knows what is up.   Tasting menu (believe it was 7 courses) + a bottle of wine. ~$140 (incl tax and tip) per person.   ________________________________________ 1. Knocked off .5 because it's not a to-die for experience that's like a supernova explosion."}
{"text":"Before you read on to my food recommendations, I want to mention that the service was NOT 5 stars. The waiters seemed disengaged and snooty, and they were not helpful at all in recommending dishes to us. The 5 star rating is solely for their food, which was out of this world delicious. This restaurant is an Italian tapas-style restaurant, but FYI some of the dishes are probably too small to be shared. Their wine list is insanely extensive - it comes as two hefty, hard-cover, bound books. I know nothing about wine but I do know that they had a fizzy red wine which was AMAZING. I don't remember what it was called but there is only one wine that fits that description.   I loved the following dishes: - Scrigno \"chest of pasta\" - highly instagrammable delicious morsel of cheese-filled pasta  - Stella di ricotta - this was like a melt in your mouth cheese souffle. I didn't care too much for the broth - it seemed to make the dish too salty - but the souffle part was bomb - Raviolini - OMG SO GOOD. I can only eat ravioli that contains snails now.  - Beef brisket + lamb - delicious and tender  I didn't care for:  - Rapa bianca (pickled white turnips)  - Orata (raw sea bream)  For dessert we shared the pastiera (lemon tart) which I loved, and the la chiarina (sponge cake with chocolate and espresso gelato) which was also good."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Wonderful wine lists. Quality and good tasting food. But be warned that the the portions are tiny (eat before or after going to Il Covo)."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Really liked the idea of Italian shareable dishes with a Venetian concept, probably coming back soon. Service was really attentive, made my night memorable. We were a party of two and we ordered the tramezino fritto (4/5 points), scigno (5/5 points), raviolini con lumanche (5/5 points) - best dish of the night, agnello alla grillia (5/5 points)- not a shareable dish thou, an the pork and lamb sausage (4/5 points). The portions are really small, so don't be scared of ordering approximately 3 dishes per person Not impressive dessert, that is why I give this restaurant 4 stars."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Little Italy, this new Italian restaurant is sure to be raved. I was lucky to come in for a dining experience with a friend prior to the restaurant's official grand opening, and was surely appreciative in taking a part of experiencing fine Italian food from chef Ryan Campbell and his team.   Each dish that came out was not only beautifully presented by the lovely interactive servers, but also tasted stellar as my friend and I couldn't wait to dig in while the server would explain each dish that came to us - but I suppose anything that is presented to you in Italian makes it sound more exciting to eat! All the dishes we got were unique in their own ways and delicious. But a true must get is the Scrigno; a pasta filled with  garganzola and parrmigano, then beautifully torched for a wonderful texture! It was surely my favorite dish, along with the cod and snail tortellini! Make sure you also have room for dessert as the Tartufo is also a must! The tartufo was one heck of a surprise as it was fun breaking into and seeing the chocolate liquor ooze out onto the plate. It was darn delicious with it's various layers and textures of the pistachio and chocolate shell as well as mascarpone ice cream!   This restaurant will surely be one to bookmark for foodies that love Italian. I'll deffinetly be back and be taking friends and family once they open up to the general public."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding. Not easy to have conversation as it was loud but I would say it was energetic. You definitely should try as the price is reasonable especially for all the values that you receive. Most of the food was beautiful and interesting."}
{"text":"Beautiful and rustic. The place has a lot of charm and visual appeal. Drinks and wine list is really nice. Service is some of the best in the city.  Where the restaurant falls short is the menu, which is extremely surprising since we're talking about an ex buca chef, and there's high expectations. The food is bland, under seasoned, flavours are over described and then under delivered, and there's not a single dish over two visits that I even care to remember.    In light of how disappointing the food is, the cicchetti style menu just seems like an excuse to overcharge. You can easily spend $100 per person here and not actually be full by the end of the meal.     The only thing at this restaurant that is really of any interest is the friendship coffee service. I would come back to this restaurant for friendship coffee and dessert only."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for Il Covo, and they were mostly met by Ryan Campbell's new and exciting establishment. The restaurant is very striking, from the impressionable doors to the charming, rustic d√©cor it creates quite the ambiance.The menu can feel a little disjointed at first glance, as it's arranged by sea, earth and pasture, rather than apps, primi and secondi. We opted for the oysters, the fried bread with shrimp and scallops, the scrigno, the ravioli, merluzzo all Siciliana, and the salsice drums.  The real standouts for me were the fried tremazzino, the scrigno, and the ravioli. The tremazzino was full of fresh shrimp and scallops with crisp bread and chives - reminiscent of the best grilled cheese sandwich you could ever think of. The scrigno was bursting with fresh gorgonzola and braised radicchio, very balanced robust flavours and perfectly made pasta to wrap it all together. But my real favourite was the ravioli. Stuffed with mushrooms and snails, the rich earthy flavor was balanced by a rich cream sauce, all wrapped in a perfect al-dente pasta - truly a shame they're only served in threes.  The oysters were topped with little lemon juice-filled pearls that would burst when eaten - I found the lemon was a little to sharp and overpowering to appreciate the fresh Kusshis. The sausage drumsticks were a bit of a miss for me too, they weren't that interesting, flavourful and were a little too tough.  I'm looking forward to make my way back and try some more of the menu items that captured by curiosity."}
{"text":"I just finished a mediocre glass of wine, a decent salad, a mediocre, oddly small and definitely slightly undercooked - like a minute under al dente, portion of pasta served at a snail's pace. Coincidentally, I am a mediocre cook, but that said - I feel confident in my ability to produce a better cacio e pepe than I just had. Gloppy, too rich to finish. $75 for two salads, two plates of pasta and a glass of wine - ended up at the Italian place next door for a very satisfying meal there."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem! At the time of my visit, they have only been opened for 5 weeks and they have pretty much got everything nailed down. The service was excellent - starting from the welcome rose bubbly to the extensive wine list, and of course the fantastic dishes there.  Their menu is clearly laid out would please the pickiest of eaters, separated by categories (seafood, meat, garden, cheese, etc), and with allergy/diet restriction symbols clearly labeled, and dishes ranked from light-tasting to heavy.  Dishes here are cichette-style - half portions that are meant to be shared. They suggested 4-6 dishes for each diner, but we shared 10 dishes amongst the 3 of us and we were really full at the end, with just enough room for dessert.  The star of the evening was the beef brisket, so tender that it practically melted in my mouth! Honourable mentions include the whole escargot stuffed ravioli, and the Iberico pork fat wrapped roasted carrots. But honestly, nothing was a \"miss\" for me there, and I would gladly go back time after time.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"A beautiful rustic Italian fare restaurant styled as Venetian cicchetti (Italian tapas).  Delicious but definitely was not a cheap nice where dishes ranged from $9 and more and recommended where 4 dishes each.  Portions were small.  $14/glass of wine, normal but still pricy.  From their \"del Mare\" (the sea) we tried their: Orata ($12) and Vongole ($19) which were raw sea bream and clams, respectively.  They were a very light fare--which I quite enjoyed.  There were crispy bread that came with it (but not enough, 3 pieces).   From the Dall'Orto section (not sure what it means) we tried the Scrigno ($15) which are \"chests\" of pasta filled with a well-balanced mixture of tangy, creamy Carozzi gorgonzola and slightly bitter radicchio di Chiogga, all set off by 10-year-aged Modena balsamic.    From the Dall Pascova section we tried the  Raviolini ($12) which was so so so yummy, silken pouches of pasta stuffed with earthy braised snails and mushrooms in a creamy cow's cream, goat's butter, and a bright rosemary oil.   We also tried the red deer drizzled mirto and chocolate moss which was beyond interested, cervo Rossi ($18)  We finished off with a cheese plate, raschera--unpasteurized cow, sheep and goats milk cheese with orange marmalade ($9); and two sweet desserts, Cassata Siciliana ($9), sweet ricotta cake with pistachio and preserved citrus--it reminded me of marzipan in cake form.  Lastly, La Chiarina made of traditional abruzzese sponge cake, soaked in espresso vermouth and layered with a vanilla and chocolate crema, and espresso gelato.  It's making me hungry writing this!  It is absolutely delicious and such a lovely \"hideout\" but we warned, you will be hungry after!  Tapas tease for the tummy!  The reason for the 3 stars is because food was great, service was good, ambiance was nice but by no means was anything beyond the experience of a delicious meal with great company.  In addition, value is another point to consider and considering we spent almost $80/pp and was nowhere near \"full\" (we went to another restaurant after) 3 Star was favourable in my opinion."}
{"text":"Cicchetti are small snacks or side dishes, typically served in traditional \"b√†cari\" (cicchetti bars or osterie) in Venice, Italy.  Buca ex chef Ryan Campbell does cook up a storm of Cicchetti in his new venture Il Covo with this Cicchetti concept in Little Italy. I was transferred for a few hour to somewhere warm, where people just wine and dine and sharing good food and wine with friends!   What should we order?? Everything looks good in the menu. The beauty of smaller plates does let me try out different items and this is especially great when my friend willing to share everything with me!!  dal mare ostriche ~ west coast kusshi oysters, watercress, lemon insalata di mare ~ chilled salad of mixed seafood, salsa verde, trout roe, pickled peppers meriuzzo alla siciliana ~ tomato braised black cod, basil, caper, pine nut, olive monacale  dall'orto scrigno ~ chest of past a filled with gorgonzola and radicchio di chioggia, mosto cotto  dal psacolo nduja abruzzese ~ pork skin crackling, spreadable salame from abruzzo, artichoke ash raviolini con lumache ~ garlic braised snail and mushroom stuffed pasta, cow's cream, goat's butter, rosemary oil agnello alla griglia ~ grilled lamb, graffiti eggplant, yukon potato, rosemary  dal casaro burrino ~ butter rolled in mozzarella, warm bread, sicillian white anchovy blu di frabosa ~ pasteurized blue veined sheep's milk cheese, aged 8 months, piemonte, served with blood orange rose gorgonzola carozzi ~ pasteurized blue veined cow's milk cheese aged 4 months, from lombardia ,served with apple mostarda  dal forno tiramisu al limone ~ lemon lady finger, limoncello, mascarpone mousse tartufo ~ zabaglione gelato, candied almond, chocolate liquor  There are also a wide selection of wine to pair with all your food. Giuseppe Marchesini also from Buca would help you with the wine selection. And if you are not a wine drinker, there is also Italian style cocktails, spirits and other drink options.  I can't wait to be back and try out other items on the menu. I still thinking of that soft and creamy burrino with fresh baked bread whenever I have my carb craving!"}
