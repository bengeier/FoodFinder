{"text":"On Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday (as long as it's not a game day) Joe's half priced burgers are a power move. These things are huge, come with a generous portion of fries, and it's really the kind of meal you should eat only half of and bring the rest home as leftovers. I've had most of the burgers without mushrooms. The Bob Marley, Spazzle, Four Twenty, Dick Butkus, and California are some of my favorites. If you're not feeling fries then their mac n cheese is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow....went to campus to partake in some bar hopping while the students were gone. Hardly anyone was  in the bar. We had been served by a girl with an Illini scarf and was awesome. Then....another girl took over. We ordered a diet with vodka, a Coors light and 2 Joes brew. What we received was a coke and jack and 3 Coors light.  THEN....the bartender gave us the new vodka and diet and walked away without giving us any beers. Amateur at best."}
{"text":"Long review comin at ya:  I'd been here a few times during the school year on a weekend night and it was a pretty decent time. Came in here on a weekday night last week, Wednesday I think, and it was empty except a few people sitting at the bar where the absolute shittiest rap music was blasting the entire time we were there. But whatever, I'd heard the burgers were good so I brought in my friend from out of town to have a casual meal. The waitress seemed rushed. Joe's usually has some kind of burger deal on Hooked, and this one was for a burger and draft beer for $6.95. I told the waitress we had the hooked deal and she asked what burgers and drinks we wanted. I ordered my burger and draft and my friend wasn't really feeling the drafts so I asked if he could substitute anything else instead? And she said we couldn't. Ok, no big deal. He ordered a goose island draft with his. Music was still incredibly loud and shitty but our food came quickly. We had ordered a pretzel and cheese appetizer but it was brought out the same time as the burgers. Waitress still seemed like she was in a hurry. Our burgers were extremely mediocre and dry. I had the jalape√±o and goat cheese one and had really expected it to be better. My friend was also unimpressed with his but we both agreed the fries were good. I had to ask for ketchup since our waitress didn't bring any. She also didn't bring us any napkins or silverware or anything so I went up to grab some myself since she was sitting at the bar.  We had barely taken a bite of our burgers when she came back, dropped off the check, and said, \"Hey can you guys pay, bc I have to clock out.\"  Um ok? You really couldn't have waited another 10 minutes and not been rude? But hey, maybe she had to rush home for some important reason right? Nope. Parked herself at the bar counter with a giant, literally fishbowl-sized alcoholic drink with like a can of redbull or something in it and sipped it while we ate our burgers. That was what you rushed us for? So you could drink your booze? Also, she overcharged us. She gave only me the hooked deal price but not my friend who was on the same bill. His was $9.95 for the burger plus I think $4 for his draft. Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me the hooked deal wasn't going to apply to his portion? I had even asked if he needed to get a draft with his deal and she said yes, he couldn't substitute.  Completely awful experience. My friend and I have both worked in the food service industry for years and in all the times we've gone out, have NEVER not tipped for service, even when it was shitty. This was beyond shitty and the first time we didn't tip. 1 star."}
{"text":"Went to this place when I was 20 and blacked out. I threw up standing in line waiting to go inside.  I dont remember much, but I do remember a girl who was younger than me grinding on me. It was fun.   I didnt not eat their food or remember the drink prices.  I would go there again...if I was 20."}
{"text":"Reviewing Joe's solely based on their food, which is surprisingly delicious. The half-priced burger days are a really good deal and they have such a great variety to choose from. Also, you can get a side of mac and cheese and let me tell you it is in the top three mac and cheeses offered in the Chambana area. If you can get over the fact that you are eating at Joe's, which for me is a bit of a struggle, it is a must try."}
{"text":"Joe's almost always has cover, no matter what time of night, but it's definitely worth it. The front area has pool tables, booths, tables, a large bar, and bathrooms. Ladies, be ready to wait in line (or sneak in the boy's room when no one is in there like I did)!  The back room has the dance floor, a stage with stripper poles (this can get slightly scandalous) and a bar. A very eclectic mix of people, I remember my friends nick naming it the UN convention, because all different types of people come together. Decent specials, but one of the more expensive bars on campus."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars on campus. I like their food, so I go there during the day, but the night life there is pretty fun. But only go there late if your planning on getting wild. The drinks are mediocre."}
{"text":"I only know enough about Joe's to know that the burgers are delicious, and that they're half off on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. I almost always get the Loaded Potato burger, which is great, and their fries are amazing. Occasionally the service is really, really slow, which is a real pain in the neck, but it's not a regular problem. Their drink specials are also pretty good, on par with the rest of Campustown.   As long as you treat Joe's like a den of vampires (avoid after dark), it's a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Where can I start with this place? It is the greatest creation ever. This bar alone has changed humanity. I had the craziest adventure of my life at this establishment."}
{"text":"Joe's.  Meh.  There's always a cover here (sometimes going up to as much as they charge for nightclubs up in Chicago!  Wtf?), the line's always hella long, the floor's always really sticky/crunchy, the crowd's always really trashy/slutty (what can you expect with stripper poles on a stage by the dance floor?), the drinks are overpriced, and the place is always super packed.  So really, if this is what you're into, then you'd probably love it here, but it's just not for me.  The crowd you find that frequents Joe's consists of a lot of scantily clad sorority girls and collar popping frat guys.  If you can manage to maneuver your way through the sea of bodies in the hella hot and humid place and manage to secure a pool table, it can be alright with some friends and a beer.  They do have heating lamps and an outdoor area for if you need some fresh air from the stifling bar, but all in all, I would say Joe's is my least favorite bar on campus."}
{"text":"Joes was a really fun place to go... When i was 19.  Great dance floor and quite amusing watching girls try to pole dance. Nice employees. But if youre looking to get something besides a draft/bottled beer, or a single shot single mixer, not the place to go. Pretty sure the bartender had to look up and/or ask how to make a dirty martini. They were young tho. Plus not a lot of college kids can drink dirty martinis nor order them."}
{"text":"Ew. Sticky floors, poor service and always a grimy guy outside waiting to verbally assault you. No thank you. My friends came here to get burgers so I waited outside with them. The waitress, I know not her name, was incredibly RUDE and inattentive. She spent nearly 1 hour and 45 minutes flirting with a table of guys right in front of us, without checking up on our table. Hello, rude waitress. Nobody tipped, and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us. We had to hound her to even pay for the meals. What a horrible waitress. She really should be fired. Both our table and another table of girls never got served until the kitchen almost closed. Yikes...they really need to improve their service."}
{"text":"Granted it's a dive campus bar but been frequenting them for half price burgers on Tuesday. Food was pretty good, loved the Mac and cheese as an upgrade. However today's visit had a special friend attend with us. Spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall. So much for the green health inspection sign on the door! Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I miss this place; but only for early afternoon time on thursdays when you get fabulous service from the barkeep: frosted pint glasses and .10 most-delicious-cram-as-many-as-you-can-into-your-fat-mouth cent wings?! it's hit or miss when you go at night though; they do have a decent beer selection and $2 u-call its but I'm over the disgusting floors of Green St bars, random ass grabbing, and getting spilled on. Come here for happy hour and you're set. Come here for happy hour on a thursday and you're treated like royalty. If it weren't for that alone I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The only reason I've ever been to this hell hole is because I knew someone who worked there. You can see overweight sorority girls clumsily swinging around the \"poles\" in the back bar while attempting to get the attention of one of the bartenders and dodge the puke on the floor.  One good thing is that the drinks are RIDICULOUSLY cheap. shots are $2, pitchers can be as low as $4. I would imagine that if you went there in the afternoon you could have an enjoyable happy hour on the patio, but don't go anywhere near this place after 10."}
{"text":"Ha, Joe's, or as I like to call it, \"The House of Regrets\" was oddly one of my favorite places. It probably had to do with one summer when I had a Temporary Tattoos-day party during 8th grade dance night. The dance floor is where craziness happens and I honestly haven't spent any time anywhere else in that place. But from what I remember, which isn't very much, that alone makes it worth going (but not worth cover, which btw, why did they charge cover this summer? -1 star).  Last comment, lol to the review that recommended KAM'S for a \"better time\" than Joes. Joes might have the sticky floors, creepers, and it's fair share of d-bags, but at least it doesn't perpetually smell like vomit."}
{"text":"The burgers are DELICIOUS, as well as the fries.   Yes, the service can be slow at times but there are limited servers (many of which are new since they hire often) being screamed at by drunk students and alum at all times, so you can't blame them. Typically the staff is very positive and polite despite the high demand crowds.   Also, Joe's is extremely casual and is also a college bar. As long as you come in with the mindset that your food may take longer than you would prefer it to, you will have a great experience with delicious food!"}
{"text":"The Tuesdays half price burger offer with 20 percent off loaded fries is one of the best offers for burgers in town. The fries were  very crispy and were served with shredded bacon. The ambience is also  pretty good and they have a large selection of awesome burgers."}
{"text":"First off, the people that run this place, such as the bouncers are complete assholes.  Aside from that, the drinks are really weak and the area is just too crowded to even move.  There are a ton of creepers on the dance floor and quite a few nefarious characters.  It's not worth it."}
{"text":"My first experience with Joe's was late on a weekend. Definitely not my scene when it comes to drinking, but it's a great spot for good food. Farren's was my favorite burger until I tried the Ragin' Cajun. Even the fries were on point and I typically hate fries. I wasn't even drunk and this meal was like a religious experience. The Bob Marley burger has some awesome stuff going on as well, just not as caliente as I like. The girls behind the bar never really seem to be on top of things, but I've never had an issue with service. This is a great spot for lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"Usually love this place til today, my girlfriend and I  saw a roach crawling on a counter for drinks while eating SO DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Checking out your bill. I order the 1/2 priced burger, but they charged me $40 for two burger and soda."}
{"text":"Half price burgers on Saturdays - which also applies to the veggie and chicken versions (but not the 3/4 pound beef ones) - are a great idea. For traditional patties, you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger. The Mac & cheese isn't necessarily worth the $1 upgrade, so don't bother - unless you want to pay for boxed mac&cheese that has some bacon bits tossed on top. They have a good selection of beers and sodas (be aware that it's not Pepsi *or* Coke products but RC/Dr. Pepper). I thought the draft of Bell's two-hearted complemented my Urbana veggie burger quite nicely. If they'd offered ice cream for dessert, it would have been true love. Also, note that it was very crowded (and noisy) indoors but that they have an extensive patio. There was an upstairs space as well, but they apparently only open that for table service *some* of the time."}
{"text":"Service was horrible from the start. We waited for an eternity just to get menus. There was even a wait after I personally had to ask them to bring us menus. The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.  Second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.  Now the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.  It's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...  If you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"The floor is sticky, packed tight that you can't access either the bar or the bathroom if you wanted. Decent number of options on tap however, and it's leagues above Kam's. However it's a lot trashier in quality than Brother's. At least it has an outdoor section for the nicer times of the year which is a huge relief when you want to get out of the sweaty inane madness that is Joe's."}
{"text":"People are generally pretty excited about \"half-price burger days\" which seems to happen multiple days a week... In my opinion, the burgers are overpriced to begin with and I'm not sure why anyone would visit here if it wasn't A. \"half-price burger\" day or B. you're just trying to get sloshed with some homies.   I've been here a few times and tried their burgers. They're alright. The mac n' cheese side is an upcharge, but it's pretty good, very heavy. Recently, I ordered a veggie burger with no bun (not about to waste my carbs budget on some basic ass bun, ja feel?) and the whole bottom of the burger was burnt and seemed to have something stuck to underside of it. I'm guessing the grill just hadn't been cleaned in a while...  If you want a good burger, go to Seven Saints or Destihl. If you're more of looking for a place with a college atmosphere, come on in. This place feels just like your local frat house."}
{"text":"Ah good old Joes, if the bars in Champaign were batman characters this place would be two face. There is a lot about this bar I really like which can be summed up as follows, great outdoor seating, great food, just a fun place to hang out and chill. If you can get a pitcher of Lunch Boxes i highly recommend that stuff was the best. Beware though when it gets dark, it then becomes a little sleezy on the dance floor, don't get me wrong we had a lot of fun as freshman and sophmores but after that everyone kind of looks back and cringes at the whole thing. Be on the look out for suspicious men weaving in and out of the dance floor who are there alone and clearly not students but still want to \"hang\"."}
{"text":"This place is cavernous!  You can walk around in there and keep finding little niches to stand.  Ample tvs for game watching and great college spirit.  My niece enjoyed her \"Gatorade\" which looked pretty good.  Despite the frigid temps, the entire place was rockin'!  Solid drinking establishment!"}
{"text":"While this place is full of the scum of the Earth, I still have fond memories of this place. You always leave there with a great story, even if you had a miserable time. There is a good chance you are going to stumble out of there around 2AM covered in sweat and vomit, and it might not even be yours! Some of my best and worst college experiences come out of this place and even though I graduated this past May and have all of Chicago at my disposal, I still sometimes wish I could wait in line for a half hour for the opportunity to get mediocre well drinks and my dance on."}
{"text":"My favorite bar on campus! They've got a huge deck, deals every day, and a surprisingly great food menu. There's a lot of different kind of bars on campus but I believe this one is the most versatile and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Classic college bar. Best thing is the 1/2 priced burgers (which they have a ton of good options of) they have 2-3 nights a week. Drinks are reasonably priced. Service Is decent. If you're not there to party with college friends or get a half off burger it's probably a good idea to find another spot in CU!"}
{"text":"Joe's has the best fries! And there are some specials everyday! Half price burger and 25% off for loaded fries on Thursday. Don't wanna miss that!"}
{"text":"Always packed and the dance floor is small and dirty.  I guess i used to like clys better but they went downhill too."}
{"text":"Love Joe's new outdoor balcony. Good drink deals, nice bartenders. Definitely had a lot of friends here that worked here during school. definitely catch this place on half price burger day. Fries are to die for. Great place."}
{"text":"They've got some really great specials! We came on a Friday and got a pitcher of shandy for $6. Their burgers are good, especially The Mountain (with avocado), and the Bob Marley. Also, I really liked the fries!! Customer service is pretty lax, but not necessarily poor. Restrooms are clean...enough. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Joes is a solid college town bar. The outside area is really nice and when it's nice out I'm a big fan of hanging out either upstairs or downstairs outdoors. Drinks are good and the bartenders are cool. What is unique about Joes is that they actually have really good burgers and really really good fries. They have all kind of specialty burgers like ones with egg put on it and others. I wouldn't pay full price but on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday they have half price burgers and that's when it's a really good time to go. Joes is a very affordable place whether you are drinking or eating and it has a really fun atmosphere especially when it is nice out and everyone is hanging outside. Overall, Joe's is a U of I staple and a really good place to drink and/or eat. Big fan of Joes and I will continue to go back there!"}
{"text":"One of the worst bars on campus. The place gets super crowded and the music is deafening. If you like not being able to move, having drinks spilled on you, and watching underage girls pole dance, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Finally got to stop in for lunch! When you walk up, you can still smell the stale beer that has surely soaked into the wood work at this point. Who knew this place had such great lunch! Lots of awesome ingredients from guacamole, to goat cheese, to fried eggs for your burger!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there several times during the day and early evening , the foods has always good , and the service has always be delightful, friendly and fast. I can't comment on the late night crowd but I can see it getting rather loud and, crowded and wild but thats a College thing , I assume it would have been a great place for me  years ago"}
{"text":"Joe's is so hit or miss.    Food: In my experience they have really bad dining service.  Normally you have to wait forever if a waitress even comes to you at all.  They have cool burgers but the actual meat is just ok.  It used to be half priced on Tues Thurs and sun,  but then they changed it to only half price with purchase of a drink.  I remember once I went in and ordered a burger and water not knowing they changed the deal and the waitress didn't say anything and charged me for a drink anyway.  When I explained that the bill was wrong she said that was the new deal but never explained that when I was ordering. There are a few times where I was seated and the waitresses took so long to give us menus and walked past several times without saying anything so we went to legends instead.  I give the dining here 1 star  drinking: Joe's is really fun! The beer garden is nice and the dance floor is lit! They start flashing the strobe light from 1--2 and the energy is great.  Senior night with the 2nd floor bar has $1 wells and is super fun.  I also like how they added a second floor to the beer garden.  Expect to pay $5 cover when it's busy but this is a fun happy hour and dance bar.   Overall: go for lunchbox pitches but not for lunch!"}
{"text":"Joe's Brewery is your average looking bar in Champaign. On Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, Burgers are $5 dollars. I got the Gold Rush Chicken burger, which I thought tasted pretty good. The chicken was well done and was seasoned properly. The meal also includes a side of your choice. The only reason why it deserves 3 Stars was because the wait time was ridiculous. We waited close to one hour to be seated, and then an additional 30 min waiting for service. However, we were compensated by receiving an additional side for our meal. In the future, I recommend getting carry out and avoid the hassle of dining in."}
{"text":"Great burger selection but the execution was a little weak for my California Burger (fried egg, guacamole, BLT, cheese on 1/3lb burger).   The fried egg tasted like a boiled egg and I couldn't tell there was guacamole on the burger but it was okay.  They have two full pages of burgers so I'd be willing to try them again.  It's 1/2 price burgers on Tuesday nights so my meal was less than $5 so I gave them three stars for my first visit."}
{"text":"fantastic scenery! the service is incredible! all yah need is a beer and a mother egging bro"}
{"text":"Maybe I am missing what the big draw to Joe's is but I feel like C-U and Campustown have better bars around town. Being a grad student, I think the appeal is usually lost. The only plus is that they have my favorite cider (Strongbow) on tap. The service is okay and I am glad that they at least have their own beer. Their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay. Given the choice, I would choose other bars over Joe's."}
{"text":"I guess if you enjoy paying $5 cover to breath in pukey air it's OK. There's a dance floor in the back that smells like trucker farts and peanuts. Overall it was an ok experience"}
