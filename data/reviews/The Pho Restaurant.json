{"text":"The Pho Restaurant is likely my new go to restaurant for pho. The food, service and decor were great. My friend and I came for dinner on a Saturday night and each ordered a large Pho Tai Bac (#B1, northern pho style, rare beef with noodles, onions, gingers and scallions), which was $10 per bowl. We were given the option to get either the fresh noodles or the regular Vietnamese rice noodles. We went with the latter but will definitely try the fresh noodles next time. We were also given the option for cooked bean sprouts or fresh bean sprouts but we again went with the latter. The bowls arrived quickly and were piping hot. The broth was light and not too salty. The beef was tender and the noodles were just right. The bean sprouts, basil and lime were fresh and clean. The service was good and all the servers seemed attentive and quick to respond to any requests. The decor and cutlery was modern and clean so hopefully it stays that way since they seem to have just opened recently. Even though my preferred payment method is credit card, they unfortunately only accept cash or debit card. However, all things considered, I have zero complaints and would definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"New owners here. Newly renovated. The menu is great quite extensive. The vermercilli is the best deal here at 8.50.  The only bad thing is the msg. My throat was so dry after this meal. 3.5 star  If you're OK with msg, this place is a good meal for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, very tasty and service is excellent. Really recommend this place. Love Pho and Bun bo Hue."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was so good. I'm not sure how this traditional dish is supposed to taste like but this was so flavourful, I slurped up all the soup!  Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"I went tonight, and normally I don't give any review whether a restaurant is good/bad, and thus I didn't take any pics of the menu or the food b'cos that's just not my style of taking pics of a normal meal.  I am typing a review this time, b'cos I definitely want to return again, but I hope there will be some improvement when I return next time.  What we ordered today, all the food we ordered are yummy and good quality: 1) raw beef soup noodle 2) dry noodle 3) rice dish 4) appetizer 5) iced coffee  Pros:  clean table/menu/utensils/floor/bathroom, very friendly servers, good quality of food, nice presentation, kids friendly  Cons: - I find the tables of all pho places are a bit small for our family (2 adults, 2 kids) when we most of the time order 3 dishes with extra bowls to share food.  Their table is of similar size as other places, so for me, it is small.  - Iced coffee: $5.5 if I recall correctly? It is very yummy, but is it a bit pricey given the size?  Their coffee is more expensive than a Starbucks frappuccino!!    - I often choose the same dishes in all the pho places I went, but their menu is a bit small with  limited choices? Not a big deal for me, I am picking the same 3 or 4 dishes every time I go.  - size/portion of their food: the price on menu looks similar to all other pho places, BUT the size of the actual dishes seemed to be a smaller than average? We can finish 3 dishes plus an appetizer and iced coffee w/o any left over to bring home.  Usually if we order 3 dishes, there will be plenty of left overs.  In order to earn returning customers, customers have to feel what they paid for are of \"good value\".  You've already provided good quality of food which is the KEY for us to return.  Slightly up sizing the portion of the dishes won't cost you a lot, but customers will find your restaurant is offering much better value than other places and they will return automatically.  You don't have to believe what I say, just go around to do a survey of the dish size and price of other pho places in Markham/Richmond Hill area.    Giving 3 stars for this time, and I am hoping it will be a 4 stars next time when I return!"}
{"text":"We love pho! Therefore, we had to try this place when we got their flyer at our door for 15% off. Upon arrival, the staff were very welcoming. They have a variety of Vietnamese food but we tried the Pho and the vermicelli bowl. I tried the \"Build your own Pho\" option with Satay soup base. You also get as many toppings as you want. It was great! I love Satay flavour and this place definitely gets it right! My wife had the vermicelli and the portion is very generous. You get to pick 3 toppings which  is awesome!  Overall, we were really pleased. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and value for money    Quite a wait for your table that's says the place is great."}
{"text":"For appetizers we ordered the fried spring rolls. It was very flavourful and crispy. You can taste the the prep of each ingredient (e.g the taro, the beef, and etc) with the crunch in every bite.   For main dishes we ordered from their just PHO you menu section where you can pick your own broth and unlimited toppings from the list. We got the satay broth with beef brisket, rare beef and beef balls and the Tom yum soup base with all toppings from the list. You also got the option to pick either getting fresh or regular rice noodle and either raw or cooked bean sprouts. We opted for the fresh noodles and raw bean sprouts. Both soups came out very hot and the rare beef / bean sprouts were fresh. The soups were very flavourful and not too salty.   Only downside I have to say was that their avocado smoothie was somewhat bland.   Compared to other viet restaurants in Markham I would say this is one of my favourites as it's authentic/ flavourful and we would definitely be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Went early and was seated right away.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Prices reasonable.  Had the raw beef pho - small $8.75.  The soup base was tasty and the beef quantity was OK, could be a bit more, but not bad.  You can choose between fresh or dry noodle.  Also had the grilled beef bun - $8.75.  This was also tasty.  The beef had a good flavour - could taste the grill.  Serving size was good.  Most of the options you get to pick from the various toppings, 2 or 3 depending.  This was a good touch - you could try several flavours or just stick to 1.  The other foods on surrounding tables looked good also.  Will have to return to try more dishes.  I will return."}
{"text":"This new Vietnamese place caught my eye as I heard lots of good reviews about it. It helped that they were having a 15% opening discount that can be combined with the 5% check in yelp discount. Overall, my experience was positive so I will come again to try other dishes.  Appetizers  Grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves Crispy chicken wings with chilli, garlic and fish sauce Bahn dap The crispy chicken sauce was very good.  The bahn dap was good but hard to eat as the toppings would fall off, would have been better if more vegetables on it too. My favourite appetizer from the above was the grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves, very flavourful, tender and unique. Other places where I had this served it differently.  Vermicelli with pork, chicken and sugar cane shrimp cake- The marinated grilled meats were delicious. Pickled vegetables, peanuts, etc were all a good touch to complement the meats. However, the noodles were too bland even with the sauce provided. If they could improve the sauce, that would improve the dish.   I tried my friends broth for the Bun Bo Hue, and it was very flavourful and not very spicy (unlike other Viet places). Next time, I will order that.  Service & Atmosphere: Service was prompt and food came quickly. The restaurant was renovated in a minimalistic style that was soothing and comfortable."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Amazing! Went in for a late lunch after grocery shopping at T&T on Warden and was so impressed. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and seated to decide what I wanted to order for takeout. After reading the menu I decided on Bun Bo Hue, Crispy Fish Sauce Wings, a regular Pho with rare beef for my mom and an order of Cha Gio. While I waited the staff offered me tea or ice water, and were all around awesome! She seemed a bit worried that I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, especially after I said I'd never been there before, perhaps because it has some interesting stuff in it-a pork hock to be exact. I wasn't worried! The food was excellent! The pho broth was perfectly seasoned and clear, the toppings were uber-fresh and generous, and the wings were delicious! Crisp, salty, sweet and just amazing. Cha gio were big and full of delicious filling and not greasy (some grease is desirable to me however!) and my Bun Bo Hue was fabulous. The broth was salty, spicy, and so rich-tasting, and I loved the herbs and the crunchy cabbage to put in the soup. I added a squeeze of lime and it was probably the best Vietnamese food I've ever had! The restaurant was clean and modern, and even the condiments on the table were clean and not sticky-gross looking. For about $40, we got the best meal we had in Markham, and for me, best Viet food ever! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I found this place's pho wasn't that good. I ordered the satay pho and my frd ordered the original pho. Yeah, both of us didn't really like it, a little disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, the pho broth is authentic. (One of the best pho restaurants I've been to) The service is always great and it's as affordable as any other pho place. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A good Vietnamese restaurant in Markham. Lots of variety and very reasonable prices.  I love the idea of \"create your own\" vermicelli bowl. I picked bbq pork, bbq chicken, and spring rolls. There were lots of toppings and noodles for $8.75, a great value! The bbq pork was a little too burnt for my liking.   The satay noodle soup ($9.75) was not bad. Nothing special. Would have liked it more if it was a little more spicy (pretty much not spicy the way it is now).  The worst Pad Thai ($12) I've had in my life. The noodles were extremely soft and undercooked. The sauce was like tomato sauce but not sour, unsweet, and not spicy - a very bland taste. The shrimps were very overcooked and tasted gross. I highly do not recommend the pad thai here.  I would be back for the vermicelli and to try the pho, but definitely not the pad thai."}
{"text":"Okay so I finally got to check out the pho spot here.  It's located on 11 Fairborn, which is directly behind first Markham place. The parking here can sometimes get really packed. There's also not too many tables here. I would say it's a smaller location.   The price to portion for pho was decent here. I mean it wasn't cheap but it also was not overly expensive. We had an order of spring rolls and it was delicious! However, the amount of fish sauce they gave us was not enough. We also ordered a rice dish and the same thing applied. I'm pretty sure we had to ask fir fish sauce 4 times. They bring the sauce in a bowl you might as well fill it up at least half way.  With the rice dishes you can choose 2 kinds of meat.You can have beef and chicken or pork and chicken or really any combo between the 3 meats. We had the chicken and beef ribs which was tasty. The large pho sized noodles were decent portion too i mean I've seen bigger but it's still decent. I enjoyed the flavour of the broth and the beef balls were yummy too. I liked that they had the option of fresh noodles or dried noodles. I obviously went for the fresh noodles.   This place is worth checking out! Just glad there's a decent pho in town for Markham now"}
{"text":"First time come here on Friday lunch time.  Very busy, no seat left. The restaurant is nice and clean. Take a little long little long for food to come after ordered.  Pho is good, good meat and noodle ratio.  Big potion of vermicelli with choice of 3 toppings. Spring roll is tasty."}
{"text":"Must Try: Pho, Bun Bo Hue, Viet Coffee  Rating: (9/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:   Markham has been in need of more authentic and delicious pho restaurants. This place has a great menu, and features a unique chicken broth that is often sought after but rarely found.   Soup base was delicious, noodles were fresh and ingredients were plentiful.   Would come again!"}
{"text":"Craaaazy long (45 min+ wait) by 6pm on the weekends.  Had much better luck getting in on Monday around 7:30pm, with no wait and plenty of empty tables.  Ordered the rice paper rolls - Goi Cuon Tom Thit - which were OK but didn't have as much herbs like basil or mint as I thought it would hold.  Faring much better was the Pho Tai Bac: Northen pho style-rare beef in noodles soup, topped with fresh onion, shredded ginger and scallions.  Perfect for any ginger fan, the warming broth is perfect for a cold night and comforting your belly.  There are so many specialty type noodles, you're bound to find one that suits your taste...but if you're not sure which to pick, the service is friendly and they're happy to make recommendations if you need one.  Tip:  Only cash or debit is accepted."}
{"text":"Came on their grand opening with a group of friends so had a chance to sample different appetizers!  Apps: Bo La Lop (beef in betel leaves) - best app in our selection. Beef is well marinated and the betel leaves are an interesting change to vermicelli and typical rice paper.  Chicken wing with garlic fish sauce - crispy and hot. Sauce is spicy and not too salty. Had 8 pieces enough to share for a big table.  Banh dap (pork with shrimp crackers) - tender meat and marinated through. Pickled radish and carrot adds fresh ess. can have more vermicelli and veggies  Main: Bun Bo Hue - flavourful broth fragrant of lemongrass. Have tried BBH at different places and this broth is not that spicy in comparison. Comes with a big pieces of pork knuckle and lots of belly slices.   Pho - can choose R and L size. Can choose to add all toppings regardless of the size. Have fresh noodle option but ran out today. Light broth have good flavour of spices and not too salty.  Will come back again to try more dishes! Servers are viet so has the authentic vibe!"}
{"text":"Definitely a decent pho joint in Markham. Loved that they're authentic and the service was great. The guy who took our order had a great sense of humour. We went during odd hours so it wasn't busy as mentioned in the reviews I've read.   We ordered fried spring rolls, pho tai with tom yum soup, bun bo hue, pho noodle soup, and vermicelli. You get to choose different toppings for pho noodle soup or if you order vermicelli. I really like how they made their menu less complicated by allowing you to customized to your liking plus you are not limited to your choices of toppings. Flavour was good for the food. The tom yum soup has a nice spicy kick to it if you can handle spicy. I like bun bo hue as not all pho places offer it (apparently it's really time consuming and more complex to make). Ohhhhh and one more thing is that you get an option to pick fresh noodles.    Price point is average and ambience is casual. I would come back again if I am ever in the area craving for pho."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this restaurant after looking for noodles on Yelp. This place had a few menu items I've never seen before at other pho restaurants so figured it was worth a try.   Food 4/5 As I starter we tried the fresh shrimp roll (A2) which included shrimp, rice noodles, lettuce and herbs. It wasn't anything special but ingredients tasted fresh and there wasn't an overwhelming amount of noodles.  I ordered the C2 which included pork slices, ground pork, shrimp and fish ball with noodles. I don't recall any ground pork but there there were plenty of slices of pork. The chicken broth was delicious and hearty on its own. IMO adding sriarcha or housing sauce would ruin the natural flavours and goodness of the soup.   My s/o ordered the C11 which is the Central Vietnam signature noodle. Based on the menu it was a must-try and needed no description since it was that good. Broth was nice and hot with a hint of spice. It came with a pork hock, sliced pork and various other meats. Although it didn't come with flat rice noodles it was still good.  Service 4/5 Our server was friendly and attentive. The first thing she told us was about the opening promotion (15% off and 5% extra for social media check in).   Overall I'd like to come back and try more dishes. I really liked the C2 and though the broth was well made."}
{"text":"Pros: - very clean and a smaller \"homey\" atmosphere -  all staff were very friendly - food was amazing: ordered Banh Dap appetizer, grilled pork with veggies on rice noodle sheet and shrimp cracker, delicious! And was recommended the BBH Bun Bo Hue signature noodle, the broth was great, it came with rare beef, Vietnamese sausage and pig's feet. The waiter told me if we didn't like any of the food, they would not make us pay for it, loved everything!!! - the raw cabbage that comes with the beansprouts, adds some more crunch - the passion fruit shake was yummy - grand opening discount 15% off until September 24th - extra 5% off for sharing on Yelp, Instagram or Facebook  Cons: - call ahead if planning on going late night as they might be closed due to selling out - one of the waiters just started out there and wasn't too knowledgeable of the menu but he tried and got us one of the owners - lychee milkshake tastes like lychee juice  I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I saw the description of their Bun Bo Hue (BBH)  Spicy Central Vietnam signature noodle soup. No description needed - a must-try dish. However I did not regret ordering this. The soup was thick and tangy. The great thing is you can build your own noodle and just get the hue soup which my husband loved, because he always wanted more beef in his noodles.   I got the Wrap and Roll Platter and you can pick 3 meats to accompany the dish. I got grilled chicken, grilled pork sausage and spring rolls. Everything was delicious although I didn't really roll my own fresh roll because it is pretty messy.   The place is clean compared to most pho places in town. Definitely recommend and will come back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around pass 5 and the place is half full. Very nice interior, clean and very friendly staffs. Ordered their Pho large with orginal soup, rare beef and brisket with fresh noodles. Very decent size however i find the soup a bit bland. I added fish sauce and kinda mixed up the rare beef around the broth a little bit and that kinda brought out the taste a bit better. Fresh noodles nice and chewy but a bit over cooked, i also ordered the rice noodles with 3 choices so i ordered lemongrass pork, beef and chicken which is good. I just came from my trip in Vietnam a few weeks ago and find that the restaurants there a very generous with their herbs like mint and basils. Onced seated it right there right besides your regular comdiments of spicy sauce, fish sauce and chopsticks. Not sure why here in Canada they give you a few strands if leaves. Its a nice decent place would be coming back to try their other foods on the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Nice new Pho spot in Markham. Not too busy when we went and food was good.  Still not as yummy as my favourite Pho spot, but nice to have another option close by.  The pick your own toppings vermicelli is a great idea, and the Satay pho was yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the make your own dish on their menu. Highly recommend the rice plate with chicken and beef! Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"This restaurant seems fairly new, its very clean and the staff are prompt and friendly enough. I ordered the \"make your own pho\", and got the original beef, with rare beef, tendon and fresh noodles. Tip: fresh noodles are softer and wider. I think it is better with fresh, because I don't fancy thin noodles with pho. Anyhoosies, broth was full and flavorful, and onions and thai basil added a good needed kick. Bean sprouts come either fresh or cooked.  Overall very pleased, though its more expensive than pho (a breakfast food) should be. And would def come back.  I also saw on the menu the platter wraps- this is not easily found in Toronto but its a sharing dish so I couldn't try. Thought I'd mention because viet platter wraps are the best!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here a little bit after grand opening, the service was poor. Second time today and it has improved although still very popular with a lineup but wasn't too bad. I ordered the dac biet pho and the broth was sweet, the noodles tender, and just the right amount if ingredients. The tea was great too and tasted like pandan."}
{"text":"New pho place in Markham. It's a little tricky to find because it's tucked behind First Markham Place, but definitely worth the visit if you're in the area.  If you're going for the pho, you can choose your own broth (beef, chicken, satay, etc.), noodles (fresh or traditional), and items (rare beef, beef brisket, beef tripe, beef balls, etc.). Pho sizes come in regular or large. The beef broth is clear yet very flavourful! One of the better ones I've had uptown.  The lemongrass pork chop is tender and delicious - highly recommend if you want to order one of their rice dishes.  Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not bad. Prompt service, large portions. The atmosphere is okay, not fine dining but I didn't really expect it to be. The pho is good, I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"An amazing Vietnamese restaurant with flavourful food. I've only been here during lunch and they have a quick turnaround  time although it gets very busy around this time. It gets the office crowd, so if you come here with a group of people either that wait will be extra long or you might have to split tables.   I like the make your own vermicelli as you can customize what meats you like. The lemongrass chicken and pork were delicious and has a nice smokiness to the meat.  The ko bho was also good. It was beef stew with tomato and spices as the soup base. The beef brisket pieces were really tender and they gave quite a few pieces as well."}
{"text":"Bo La Lop (Beef wrapped with Betel leaf) and their Chicken wings are the best!! The rest, so-so....."}
{"text":"I decided to update my review after trying their pad thai, as well as taking other Viet restaurants I have written reviews for into consideration.   The portions were very generous, but unfortunately, the flavours lacked depth and it was pretty bland altogether. This is definitely not something I would recommend, but as I noted in my previous review, I did enjoy the pho here."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is very good however sometimes they forget the food order, but still amazing food and service excellent. Owner is also very nice. Overall very recomended place for  Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Food is yummy, it is hard to find a good Pho restaurant anymore, so I am glad the food is good.  Ambient is average.  Service is friendly.  Price is higher than average.  Overall, I like the food but it is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"This pho place replaced the previous pho place. This is a DIY shop where you can choose your soup base, noodles, toppings etc. For noodle soups and vermicelli bowls.  I opted for a bun vermicelli bowl with lemon grass pork, sausage and a spring roll for $8.75. I also got an order of their fresh rolls with shrimp for $6.50.  Overall I like the concept of DIY but I've had other vermicelli elsewhere. It's def. a decent place for viet food for cheap if you are in the area.  The lemongrass pork could be more flavourful and the fresh rolls tasted a little bland. The service is good so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"The best pho restaurant I have come across.  Menu has great choices, but I love the pho so much I have to order that when I'm there, so other stuff will have to wait.  Selection of dry or fresh noodles (I prefer the dry), and broth.  Small parking lot and place can get quite busy, so best to go in off hours.  Efficient service and very clean looking."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents. We arrived 5 minutes after opening (11:05am) and there were already people seated! At noon the place was full and there was a wait for a table. This place is super popular!  The restaurant is clean and modern looking. Servers use iPads to take your orders. Your order comes with a little print out saying what it is and listing any modifications you made.   I got the vermicelli with beef, chicken and spring rolls ($9.75). I asked them to hold the bean sprouts. My parents both got the assorted pho ($9). You get your choice of regular noodles or fresh noodles. The fresh ones are wider and softer. My dad got the fresh and my mom got the regular. We also got an order of spring rolls ($6.75 for 3 rolls).   My vermicelli bowl was ok, but I wasn't thrilled with it. I found the meats too fatty and gristly. I like my meats lean. The vermicelli was also the bigger type, like spaghettini, but I prefer the smaller type, like angel hair pasta. The vermicelli was also not hot enough (in temperature) for my tastes. I also found the vegetables, while fresh and nicely presented, lacking in quantity. I got 1 slice of cucumber cut into 2 pieces, 1 slice of carrot, and 2 slices of daikon radish. I did get a good portion of shredded lettuce though. I would have liked more cucumber, carrot and radish. The spring roll was great. Hot and crispy and made of rice paper. I had been debating between getting the vermicelli and the My Tho Noodle Soup. After eating my meal, I felt that I should have ordered the noodle soup.   My parents enjoyed their pho. Oddly,   my mom's didn't have chicken in it, even though they both ordered the same thing just with different noodles. I don't remember everything that was in it, but it had rare beef, cooked beef, tripe, tendon, and meatballs.   We were served complimentary tea as soon as we were seated. It was the most fragrant tea I have ever smelled. It smelled like pandan leaves and it tasted great. I loved the tea.  Service was friendly and nice.  The restaurant is in a plaza with free parking."}
{"text":"Updating to a 5-star. Looks like I only enjoy the dried noodles, not hand made!   This time I came with a couple of coworkers and ordered non-soup noodles with grilled chicken, pork and beef and pad thai. The grilled meats were tender and perfectly flavoured and the pad thai is going to ruin my life. I'm trying not to go out for lunch so much, dammit!  Service was, again, impeccable. Also, many choices for hot sauce. Yay!"}
{"text":"Very good pho place! Looks like this will be my go-to pho place since it is 5minutes from where I live.   Ordered the pho small for $8.75. Portion looked small but it was actually filling! Broth came piping hot which I loved. Flavour wise the pho was great and good amount of toppings.   Fried spring rolls - came in 3 for $6.50. This was very yummy. I enjoyed the filling they used and the crispy outside!   Coconut milkshake - $5.99 this was very refreshing on a hot day! You can slightly taste the coconut pieces in the milkshake. However, I would say it's on the more expensive side for a drink.   We came around 2PM on Sunday and they were already out of fresh noodles. We tried ordering the lychee and longan milkshake but they were sold out on that. Service was good and the food came quickly. Interior was bright and clean.  Definitely be returning to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place yesterday & I was not disappointed.  The restaurant was comfortable & very clean. I ordered their \"make your own\" pho bowl. It was delicious! Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The Pho restaurant is the place \"pho\" you if you are craving some decent viet food in markham   Their name might be anything but creative, but their menu is as personalized as can be for a Vietnamese restaurant.   For the rice and vermicelli dishes, instead of going through gazillion choices (like in other Vietnamese restaurants' menu), this place make it simple for you by letting you pick whatever meat ( chicken, pork, beef) and whatever sides (spring rolls, eggs, shrimp cane)  you want with your dish.  Genius! This probably shorten their menu by 5 pages!!   You also have different soup base choice for the pho, different type of noodles, and for some dish you can choose to have bread instead of noodles. (Although they ran out of bread on my visit today. Bummer)   As for the food itself, it is quite decent. Bun Bo Hue may be lacking a bit of flavour, I think they are missing a few herbs that goes in it. The Beef brisket with tomato is tender, although not much of a \"stew\" as describe in the menu, it's more like a soup.   Appetizers were spot on. Chicken wings in fish sauce, beef wrapped in betal leaves and shrimp cracker top with grilled pork. All I would order again.   Service was friendly and efficient.   Portion seems to be a bit smaller than some other Vietnamese restaurants. This just means more room for apps."}
{"text":"I called this the Ferrari of Pho (hmm how about nickname pho-rari)...it's the bomb and once you eat here, you can't go back to other pho places.  This place is always so busy and I love it when I see lineups at any restaurant; good things come to those who wait!  This Vietnamese restaurant is our family's favourite go-to place to dine at every Friday and sometimes Saturday and Sundays, hence the weight gains.  It speaks volume if I may add that the parking lot is always packed because people come to this plaza for this restaurant and we drove by here a few times on prime time Friday and Saturday and the parking lot was EMPTY because the restaurant was closed for 3 weeks.  I haven't had my pho fix for about 3 weeks since they went on vacation and can't wait to go back this weekend.  Please save me a seat!"}
{"text":"One of the Best Pho restaurants in uptown Toronto!  Food is flavourful, with different varieties, portions are good, price is very fair.  Service is very good, very attentive. It's a must try!  A party of 5 including a kid, we ordered Bo La Lop, 2xLarge Pho, Tom Yum Pho, Ga Nuong Bun/For Vermicelli.  The soup bases are good, the meat is nice, has good texture.  You can choose dried or fresh rice noodles.  The food looks good we totally forgot to take any photos.  We fully enjoyed the food very much and cleared the table in no time.  There are much more food in the menu that is normally not found in most Vietnamese restaurants unless you go to the West end.  My kid who is a picky eater said she wants to come back!  The only negatives I found tonight were: it was a bit hot in the restaurant (hot day) and a bit noisy when they blended juices... otherwise, it's just superb."}
{"text":"Amazing bun bo hue here! I didn't even know this place existed until I saw it as I was exiting. This place is authentic and MUCH better than the pho place in the main plaza. The prices are higher but quality and flavors are way better. The broth was extremely flavorful and deep, and they were generous with toppings. Even the regular pho was great. It is also very clean which is a plus."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  This amazing gem of a Vietnamese restaurant can be found hiding behind First Markham Place.  It appears to be a family run restaurant.  Now I had decided to wait on my review. I thought I'd go a few times before confirming that this has quickly become my favourite pho restaurant in York region.  You walk in and you find a nice clean and nice sized space. The aromas of traditional pho and other Vietnamese dishes start to fill your lungs.  They have your traditional dishes, some bun and of course pho. What I enjoy is the build your own pho. You choose your soup base and you can have your pick of meats. Actually you can add all the meats and your choice of fresh or dry rice noodles with no extra charge. We've tried the regular beef broth and the tom yum gong soup ($1 extra) and both were amazingly flavourful. I had recently tried another new pho restaurant with the same order, tom yum gong soup with raw beef and dry rice noodles and The Pho restaurant takes the cake. It's spicy and sour but you can taste all the herbs and layers of spiciness within it. The beef broth is full bodied and beefy, especially when you add the raw beef slices. The beef slices are fresh and the marbled type so you don't get the tough meat. The beef balls are the traditional small beef balls, but don't judge them by their size. They're amazingly bouncy and very yummy.  If you want extra meat (double the portions) that's only $2. The Vietnamese pork sausages and basil leaf beef rolls are absolutely amazing. The flavours are fresh and multi layered.  The service is always friendly and fixed with a smile. Price wise, it's about the average $8.95 for a regular and $9.95 for the large/extra large. The portions are fairly generous but I've found it slightly inconsistent. Where one night there were more noodles and less on another day. That's the only place they lost a few points, fix that up and it's a 5 star place in my books.  Will I be back? Yup and many more times too."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the quality of the food and the customer service here. I hope that they continue to provide their customers with this much love and care as their business becomes more and more established!   Came here twice already and staff, both times, were friendly and willing to assist with the menu. We ordered the following:  Regular pho - can order as many or as little toppings as you like. Meat was fresh, and the broth was flavourful and clear without the taste of msg. I like their beef balls as they're the tiny one ones :)  Beef brisket tomato base rice noodle in soup - rich in tomato and beef flavour in the broth. Beef brisket tender for the most part (with one or two pieces slightly tougher). Not too oily. I enjoyed it.  Curry with rice - they accidentally gave us chicken when we wanted beef but that being said (we didn't make a fuss about it) the curry has great flavour, but I think the spices got diluted as the curry was slight watery. They had taro in their curry which is a nice change :)   Mung - can choose three toppings. Their grilled meats are very well marinated and the grilling gives it a charcoal flavour that enhances the taste. Mung noodles itself were good as well.  Banh Hoi - self assembling rice paper rolls. You get to choose 3 main toppings for this dish. Comes with your typical viet garnishes (bean sprouts, pickled carrots etc). Mint leaves were super fresh, meat again was juicy and nicely seasoned. Very enjoyable and fun!   Shrimp and pork rice paper roll - typical flavours and taste. Fresh ingredients. Rice paper was slightly harder than my liking. Peanut sauce is spot on. Overall nothing special for this dish.  Lastly got the Vietnamese coffee, hot - very dark roasted and strong bitter coffee notes. Condensed milk cools the butter tastes but overall delicious :)   If you're still reading I would definitely go again! Overall very good, lost some points from the watery curry but other than that, good pho place!!"}
{"text":"imo, this has similar taste to pho Asia in Mississauga which is a blessing! the broth is very flavorful and I like that they offer northern pho which is a bit spicy. You can see the herbs and ingredients in each spoonful.  the resto is spacious and clean. although it's a bit chilly in there no matter where you sit (winter time anyways, wonder how it'll be in the summer time...)   I would give it 5/5 if the portion size was bigger since it's more expensive than other pho restaurants"}
{"text":"This place is always fully packed, with good reason. They offer a choice of toppings for your pho, which is perfect for those who want a bit of everything. Their vermicelli bowl also comes with several types of meat or spring rolls, which are nicely fried."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Had the vermicelli bowl yesterday with 3 toppings. Portions are really good size and a lot of meats. Taste is really good. Ordered a pad Thai chicken take out and it was one of the best pad Thai I ever had. Good spices. The place is really clean and the staff and owner is really friendly."}
{"text":"Wow am i glad I found this pho place. It's an authentic pho restaurant with a great selection of appetizers and fusion dishes. It was packed when we arrived on a Saturday at 12:30 pm and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table of 3. It seemed like it was a popular place so we decided to wait. As I was waiting I watched the dishes come out from the kitchen and knew I made a good choice even before I ate the food. We ordered a few appetizers Bo La Lop which is beef wrapped in betel leaves, so yummy ! Also Goi Ga which is a chicken salad with cabbage, red onion, and herbs, delicious! Also tried the Bo Tai Chanh, beef with lime house and sauce and basil and other condiments. This tasted similar to the chicken salad but still yummy. For mains we had a chicken pho and a lemongrass pork chop and chicken rice platter. Portions are big and service was fast and friendly. Dishes are presented artfully. I was too busy eating to take pictures this time. This place is authentic Vietnamese. Interior is renovated and washrooms were clean and spacious. A little tight seating but typical up in this part of town. Overall great pho restaurant with fresh ingredients and great quick dining experience."}
{"text":"New pho joint in Markham. I tried the beef brisket noodle soup with rice noodles, great flavour and lots of meat. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best and most modern pho place I've ever been to. Highly recommend going here, not only because of the food, but also because of the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Very fresh pho and they offered discounts for the opening week. The broth wasn't super salty like other pho restaurants. The passion fruit drink was very good and refreshing.   Price and portion is on par with other pho establishments.   The couple that run the restaurant are very welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat close to First Markham Place and this place came up on trusty Yelp. First impressions: the decor has a clean minimalist aesthetic. The restaurant can accommodate larger groups of 6-8. It was nice to have the extra 5% off with Yelp check-in which is on top of the grand opening special of 15% off. Hubby and I didn't order pho as it was hot outside. went with com (rice) dishes. The rice dishes offer options for 2 types of protein (we got the lemongrass chicken and pork chop) for $9.50. The pork chop and chicken were tender and very flavourful and came with rice and a small salad/pickled vegetables. Hope this place does well as it would give us a  \"go-to\" Vietnamese restaurant close to home. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"AN ODE TO PHO-NOMENAL FOOD:  On a wintry, blustery night It was twenty-two below Our lashes frozen shut From the icy, windy cold  We had just finished playing A game that drained our brains It involved frantic movement, Yelling, food, and staying sane  We could hardly function. Our stomachs were in charge We had all wanted some pho Into the place, we barged!  The staff was quick to serve And directed us to our table But we had wanted a booth seat And they said \"here you go\"  I got this pork on chicken broth What stood out was the pork The taste, the texture, the aroma! In the end, I wanted more  The broth was super flavourful  And kept the noodles hot. This pho made me realize that happiness CAN be bought!  They gave around five slices of thinly folded pork It made me think of hotpot It absorbed all the broth!  In the end was a masterpiece of pork and broth combined. The pork seemed so much fresher and tastier over time  This was the best pho  that I have ever tried I would surely come again And ask for more pork next time! _____________  One star off because the broth was just a tad too salty for me, but it's definitely beautiful!"}
{"text":"Tried the bun bo hue for the first time based on yelp reviews.  Pretty tasty.    Regular pho was nice as well.  Broth a little light in taste but piping hot which is very important.  Satay pho was ok but the other 2 were tastier.  Best dish was the rice paper platter.  The combo was really fresh and tasty.  Overall food was above average.  Service was attentive.  And great value with the 20 percent grand opening and yelp discount.  Only thing is the \"large\" size noodle soups did not seem like \"large\" when compared to other pho places.  But this restaurant is now our preferred pho place in the first Markham place area."}
{"text":"We got a large pho, beef broth, various beef with cooked bean sprout. Weekday special butter chicken. Vietnamese coffee and milk tea.  The Vietnamese coffee is on the strong side (bitter) so if you prefer it sweeter u will need to ask for more condense milk or dilute it with water.  The milk tea was made with rose tea. It was softer flavour."}
{"text":"Friends and I decided to come here after a night of drinking (and discussing pho) lol...  We arrived around 2PM and there was a lineup of about 6 people excluding our group of 4...we waited around 10 mins for a table that would accommodate us. The host was very friendly and made sure we'd all be able to fit at table as it was a booth. This place is very nice and new - a first for me was the waitresses came around with iPads and the tables weren't grimey.   The menu has your traditional pho noodle soup, rice plates & vermicelli bowls, fusion dishes, banh hoi (steam rice rolls), and speciality noodles soups.   I really like that they had a 'Make your own pho' option as not every topping is liked by all. We started with tea for the table and proceeded to order. The owner came around to ask us if we had any questions which made the experience even better. He's super friendly and enjoys chatting with his customers.  Three of our party got pho, while one of us got the Cari ga soup, and I got the bun bo hue. We also got iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk (a must get at all viet restaurants)  The flavours for the pho noodle soup are complex, and while I haven't been to Vietnam (yet), I can say this soup tastes a lot better than the pho restaurants in Chinatown. The bun bo hue was so delicious - the soup had so much flavour that my boyfriend wanted more bites of my soup than usual. I'd suggest the restaurant to perhaps clean the pork hocks better as I'm not a fan of seeing the hairs on the skin and was sort of grossed out and to tone it down with the MSG...I was thirsty during, and well after our visit to the restaurant.   I'll come back for the spring rolls if I'm ever uptown near FMP. :)   Cash/debit accepted."}
{"text":"With many of my friends raving about this new pho joint, I had to come give it a try and I really enjoyed their pho here! There menu is a bit smaller than other pho places but their quality makes up for it!   You can create your own pho by choosing from their different soup bases and get to choose your meat toppings too! You are even able to add 2 or all and it does not cost you extra! Woooow!!!! For me, the sizing was quite good since I don't eat a lot, I usually don't even finish a regular bowl but their regular size here was perfect for me! Sadly they don't have my favourite viet dish here which is the crab paste/meat and tomato with noodles in soup :("}
{"text":"This is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Markham.  It is worth checking out.    This restaurant tries to stand out from other Vietnamese restaurants by allowing people to customize their own bowls.  I ordered B1 regular which is the standard Vietnamese pho and my wife got the B2 which was the pho with satay flavor.  What I really enjoyed about this place is the broth.  It wasn't overly salty.    We also order an appetizer of spring rolls which I recommend as well."}
{"text":"While I was disappointed with some of the popular items being unavailable during dinner, I really enjoyed the Pho Restaurant consider them a more than welcome addition to the Markham Vietnamese food scene.   We went on a somewhat late Sunday evening and really wanted to try their Bun Bo Hue and their springs rolls but were told they were out of both. I suppose you have to come earlier in the day! That being said we still enjoyed their pho and their vermicelli.   The build your own pho is a great idea, again, we were told they didn't have the fresh noodles (apparently they're thinner and more chinese like), so we went for the traditional variety in the classic beef broth. What I noticed was just how pipping hot this soup was in a totally wonderful way. It was borderline scorching but still drinkable. One of my biggest complaints for many restaurants are that their soup isn't warm enough, I'm glad this place does it right! And while the size and pricing might take you back initially, there's plenty of toppings and the ability to choose your proteins allow to get what you like. Of course, they're all delicious, so I got all of them. The beef is very meaty, it's tender, all that tripe and tendon was wonderful. Their broth was on the cleaner and clearer side.  The vermicelli was excellent and you get to choose from three proteins, there was a hefty amount of meat and veggies. Again, the dish arrived warm and the meats were all tender and juicy.   All in all, a great first visit here and I love how authentic they are. I can't wait to come back and try their bo bun hue and their spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Score 4 out of 5  C11. Bun Bo Hue This is the second Pho place that offers this authentic noodle soup. I ordered the regular size, but it didn't shy in the amount of meat and noodle. The hot level to me is just right, especially for someone like myself who is never kin on eating anything spicy. And the added herb does add another richness and a refreshing flavor. I do wish it comes with more shredded cabbage.  A7 Bo La Lop Grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves.  The betel leaves texture tastes and looks like seaweed. The grilled beef has a smokey flavor and the meat is tender and soft. It's a great compliment to other soup noodle dishes.  Maybe there wasn't too many people, so the waiter or the owner was quite friendly, and even took the time to explain on the dishes we were interested in ordering. I will definitely come back to try more dishes next time."}
{"text":"I contemplated on giving this place 2 stars because of the lengthy wait time for food to arrive (despite the restaurant being almost empty at the time), in addition to the lack of chicken pieces that came with my vermicelli bowl.   We arrived at the restaurant at around 430 in the afternoon on a Saturday, a time that is not busy at all. We ordered the vermicelli bowl with chicken, beef, and spring roll. Typically at other places, this dish wouldn't take more than 15 minutes to serve. However, this place took close to 30 minutes, which was really surprising given the restaurant was quiet at the time.  When we finally received our food, the amount of meat in my bowl was unimpressive. The chicken pieces looked like it had been diced up into the tiniest pieces and charred.   I don't know if I'd come back again given the abundance of pho selection in Markham."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best pho restaurants in Markham with amazing staff!  I initially came across this place through an event and since then this is my regular go to spot for Pho.  If this is your first time there, I recommend ordering their Fried Spring Rolls, Butter Fried Chicken Wings and any of their pho.  If you want thicker noodles, go with the Fresh Noodles.  I was super impressed with their Chicken Wings, this is a dish I order EVERY TIME now and once you have a bite, you will know what I mean.  Lastly if you can handle your spice, go with their signature Hue Style Soup base, you will not regret!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Viet in markham.   Tried the hue style, regular beef, dry style mixed noodles, hainan chicken rice, dry wings, betal leaf appetizer.   *everything* was amazing.  Their broths are top notch.   Can't wait to try other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly pho place. Server took the time to answer our questions and help us with the menu, as it was a bit confusing. Much friendly than the old pho place that was in the exact location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Authentic Vietnamese food in Markham, THE PHO is definitely the best! I'm giving this new place 4.5 which is considered very high according to my picky tastebuds :) I had the infamous BunBoHue and I must say, I almost wanted to finish all the soup, and it was loaded!! Their spring rolls (fried or fresh)  were super tasty AND MUST TRY!!-bòlálp (beef wrapped in betel leaf),not many places have this appetizer and I'm so happy THE PHO has this.  Every dish here is very fragrant & fresh! Definitely recommend this place to anyone lazy to drive downtown for good pho, this place definitely hit the spot and will be my go-to for the anticipated long winter :)"}
{"text":"As like previous reviews by other fine folks of the Yelp community, this place is certainly well worth the visit. Definitely a clean establishment. Definitely courteous service. And most definitely delicious dishes. The vermicelli in my Vermicelli Bowl for $8.75 was just a perfect chewy texture. Add your three toppings (in my case, grilled lemongrass pork, grilled lemongrass chicken, and spring rolls) and you've got magic in your bowl for a delightful experience in your mouth! Perfect!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent, I had the beef and tendon, broth excellent  The best I had since a looooong time"}
{"text":"came for lunch with coworkers. it's pretty small so we were pretty lucky we came just before the rush. there was a bit of a wait but that's expected, we had 6 of us. by the time we ordered there was already a wait out the door (again, it's a fairly small establishment so definitely come a bit early for lunch if you want to miss the rush) pho was great - 3 of us ordered the bun bo hue and it was excellent. broth is very flavourful and tasty, i love that they put enough garnishes: green onions, red onions, etc. there was a very generous amount of noodles and the meat was sufficient and very tender. the other 3 ordered meat dishes, vermicelli and the beef/chicken with rice! everyone was very satisfied with their portions and their dishes - we will definitely be back. considering we were with 3 boys, they were all stuffed and surprised with the large portions, they do not skimp out on meat. we also ordered a side of spring rolls, very good, you can taste the taro and the rolls were not over fried/cooked. we were very happy with our meals."}
{"text":"So I really enjoy trying places with relatively positive reviews.. Lol...who doesn't?? ...so upon reading the reviews and what my friend recommended, I came here on Sunday for lunch and man it was packed and we waited approximately 20 mins for a table of 2.  So as always order the pho, spring rolls and we also ordered the bun bo hue...food came pretty quickly but I found the broth to be exceptionally oily, not sure if it is the type of beef bones and beef fat they use or the blanching process of the broth...anyhow, the taste was flavourful but I would have preferred it with much less oil in the broth...  You could choose between fresh noodles or dry noodles,  thick or thin,  more or less. I believe it is owned by Vietnamese owners as they spoke the language.   The pricing was average and the food was flavouful, I felt thirsty afterwards, probably due to the MSG.   Anyways, will still try other places in the hood. I find it a task to find flavourful, non-oily Viet food.."}
{"text":"The noodle and satay soup here are exquisite given the price. The mix of fried scallions, satay and peanuts with every noodle bite was very savoury and definitely worth it. I used to go to VIP Saigon for my FMP pho fix but now I have options!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Went for lunch on a weeekday at 1pm. Got seated in a reasonable time.   Sat at the booth for at least 10 minutes with no menu or tea. Server got order for the able beside us and totally ignored us. Another server gave menus to their 'regular' customers and ignored us again.  Could not bother with this poor and unacceptable service. I couldn't image what would happen when it gets even busier on a weekend and at dinner.   Hopefully this place gets its' act together. Poor service deters me from coming back.   Too bad. I heard good things about this place and didn't get to try the food at all Becuse of bad service. You just lost a customer here."}
{"text":"The pho here is amazing, it is very flavourful and the meat is tender. You should try the appetizer A7: Grilled Bead with Betel leaves. The staff is very friendly and was very patient with customizing my dish."}
{"text":"Tried C11. It was very good in my mouth. I actually liked it, but then, later my stomach didn't agree. I may try the regular pho next time. Staff were kind and cheerful."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed coming here for the past half year. To me, it really beats everything other pho place in the richmond hill/markham area. They are able to make a good bowl of bun bo hue which I would definitely recommend. The service is welcoming and they keep the restaurant clean. Its one of the places I frequently think of when my friends are undecided on a place to eat."}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place so we came to give it a try. The restaurant isn't easy to see from Hwy 7 but is situated right next to A La Kitchen. The restaurant comes off clean and staff was very friendly. When we ordered, the waitress was able to accommodate our dietary needs and explained the type of noodles that were served.  Beef noodles come with a choice of noodles; regular or fresh flat rice noodle. The regular noodles are thin like the ones at Pho 88. Their fresh noodles are thicker and softer. You then choose the type of meat. You can even choose multiples, portions will only be proportional.  My wife ordered the beef regular noodles with all the meats (just to try everything) and I ordered a mixed egg noodle and vermicelli with pork. Both noodles were very tasty and full of meat. The regular noodles were soft and not floury.  We look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Probably the best service I've come across for a Vietnamese Restaurant. Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant isn't that big but there was adequate space and it was not crowded inside. It is a great addition to Markham. Price for apps are a bit steep but average otherwise. I found the fried spring rolls smaller than usual.  Ordered:  Just Pho You Pho with ALL toppings- I believe the amount in getting only one topping is equivalent to getting all of it.. so I'd advise against choosing all because you won't get that much of each item. The broth was very good and tasted authentic. You get a choice between fresh noodles or regular standard noodles.   Bun Bu Hue uses fresh noodles instead of reg. pho noodles (I'd pref pho noodles and see if they allow the change next time). The deep fried spring rolls were really good- they definitely did not skimp out on meat filling.   Bo Kho gives you a choice of either egg noodle, fresh/regular noodle or steam riced. I got it with regular noodles and the soup was very fragrant and savoury. The flank beef were definitely tender and juicy as well.  It is located BEHIND Fmp. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's belated birthday dinner. It's a really small place. Called to make reservations, we booked for Fri Evening. But fyi, they don't take reservations for Weekends. They are fairly new, so the restaurant was nice and clean.   Ordered a bunch of starters and I also only took picture of my main.   1. Spring Rolls - Nice and Crispy and very Tasty. 2. Shrimp Cakes Wrapped in Crispy Bean Curd Skin - Very yummy the Shrimp Cakes were seasoned will, but if you got kids they might find it a bit spicy. It was ok for us adults, the outer layer was fried to a nice crisp. 3. Crispy Chicken Wings with Butter Sauce - The wings were flavourful but nothing special. Tasted a slight buttery taste. 4. Northern Pho Style with Raw Beef $9 Small Added Beef Tendon +$2 The soup base was really good and flavourful and not greasy which was great. They had an option of fresh noodles and regular noodles. I asked the difference and the waitress said the fresh noodles are more soft. Next time I'll try the regular and see what the difference is. Because the noodles in my opinion were the same as any other pho place.   Overall, the food was great, service was great. Probably would come back to try other items."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is clean, inviting and slightly modern. Their service is courteous and attentive. My vietnamese friend approves and he's picky when it comes to his culture.   My vietnamese friend and I recommend the huey style soup. Its slightly spicy beefy soup. So good with any combo.  I've come here 4 times and their quality is consistant.   Great pho in Markham."}
{"text":"Things I really love: - You can order the meat items as you wish in your soup base (which means if you are tripe-averse like me, you no longer have to fish around your soup to remove it) - It's new so the restaurant is clean and renovated and well-maintained - They also had a check in offer the first time I came, points for that - Everything tastes very authentic - I don't feel the need to take MSG-induced cat naps immediately after  Things I don't like: - The staff seems quite new and so to service a full restaurant, there is a bit of a learning curve - Expect longer than usual wait times for the food and basics (tea, water)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend today. We ordered bò lá lp (Beef wrapped with Betel leaves), Spring Rolls, Bun Bo Hue (Spicy noodles), highly recommended! Extremely delicious and authentic Viet Restaurant. Service was amazing ,food came quick and price is very reasonable.  I have to say this is one of the best Viet Restaurant I have been to in Markham."}
{"text":"Can not believe I haven't written a review of this place. Frequented this place especially when it first opened.  I was very pregnant at the time and it was the summer. Imagine having appetizingly spicy, sweet and citrusy Tom yum pho noodle soup and cooling off with their lime or plum soda as I ate - SO good. I still remember the owner going up to his customers for feedback and telling us that before opening the restaurant, he had his family and friends taste test their menu items to get the noodle to meat proportions just right - and I agree it was just right. Many other places serve too much noodle to meat and taste really heavy on the msg. This is the only pho restaurant I would finish all of my noodles and meat! Like their reviewers mentioned, I love the simplicity of their menu, especially for the Bun vermicelli bowl and pho noodle soup because you won't be overwhelmed by the options. You simply pick the type of Noodle in pho soup and choose as little or as many toppings as you please. This is so much easier than other restaurants that list out a 30-50 combination of pho lol   I'm not the type to order the same thing repeatedly but I have definitely ordered the bun bowl with the pork skewer and beef in betel leaves like 5 times already. I just cannot get enough of how refreshing and appetizing the bun noodles are mixed in lots of sprouts, shredded lettuce and pickled radish/carrot with a touch of fish sauce. This was also the first place I tried beef in betel leaf and it's so good.   My favourite items on the food menu of course is the bun bowl, but I also love their satay Noodle soup, Tom yum noodle soup, and their fish sauce chicken wings.   They don't usually take reservations but when I called to ask about their wait time for 4 adults and baby, and we were 15 min away, they were willing to hold the table for us even though I didn't request it. It's definitely busy especially around 12-1 on a weekday. I really wished this place was bigger and they had 3 wait staff instead of 2 during these peak hours because it takes a while to get served. However, if you come before that noon or after 1, the place is a bit less packed and hectic!   You won't regret trying out this place! I don't go anywhere else for pho anymore!"}
{"text":"A very good Viet restaurant with long wait times - be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes on a weekend, even past 2pm. Cash/Debit only.   Pho - as always, I order the basic when trying a new restaurant.  Basically it's build your own bowl with choice of broth, noodles and unlimited toppings for the same price. I had the Beef Broth, Regular Noodle and Rare & Flank beef. First thing I try is the soup - delicious!! Piping hot and flavourful; I didn't need to add any lime juice. The beef is very good too and there's tons of it - more than I could finish! My fav item.  Carrots & Beef Brisket Noodle - the carrots are so soft and soak up all the flavor from the broth.   Bun Bo Hue - recommended for spice lovers. This was a bit too oily for me. Comes with round rice noodles.  Chicken Wings in Butter Sauce - pretty good   Lemongrass Rice - with two toppings. We had the pork chop (yum!) and the beef rib (not as good as the pork). Next time would probably just stick to pork + egg.   Viet Coffee - recommend to order this a little earlier because it takes a while to drip! Let it drip while you're still eating, so when you're done, your coffee will be ready. The condensed milk is sweet, yet nicely balanced by the bold flavor of the coffee.   Overall a very satisfying meal with nice service. Pretty large menu..will try different appetizers next time. The only downside is that I had a bit of a reaction.. either to MSG or strong seasonings."}
{"text":"I should have known that it's not a good idea to come on a weekend. Not only did we have to wait but also the service was much slower and not as attentive. Forgot to give us the bean sprout for the pho and after we asked for it the waitress pretended to go inside to get it (?) or completely forgot. Needed to ask for the second time and because it's the guy who I presumed is the owner, he brought it out right away. Also, I also finished half of the bun before bfs pho came out. The food though, was still very good that I thoroughly enjoyed. This time the bun wasn't as cold and stiff as last time. The lemongrass beef was a bit tough but chicken and pork were great and flavorful, Love them. Will definitely come back but only on weekday."}
{"text":"Our favorite pho spot! It gets busy during main dining times tho.  Lots of quality toppings. You won't feel as if they are trying to fill you up with noodles and rice."}
{"text":"\"New place with a lot of new takes on a traditional classic. Fresh, fragrant and delicious\"  This place came up in a search as part of a commitment to try new \"pho\" places around the neighbourhood. This one has been open about a month and half or so just south of First Markham Place. It's not in First Markham place so you don't have to worry about finding ridiculous parking it's actually one street south in a \"strip mall plaza.\" so keep that in mind if you're trying to find it.  Location and Restaurant  It's a nice size to it. It's got a ton of little tables crammed in there with modern finishes and what not. They have a pretty extensive menu as well as well as a \"build your own\" option which allows you to build the regular pho you might be used to.  Menu & Food  I've taken a few photos of them but you look at the menu and you some interesting combinations as well as a design-a-pho option where you can go back to a tried tested classic (like a Ph ?c bit) at no extra charge. It simplifies the process of ordering as if you like Rare Flank, or Brisket or Tripe or beef balls, you can mix and match or get them all. You can add chicken too if you like that. You also get your choice of broth, Chicken, Beef, Vegetable, Satay, and a few others. The others are extra charge but it might be worth it. They also have their a selection of noodles you can choose too.  Ordered the classic house special type of pho and was very impressed with the flavour and freshness. I mean you can only use so many adjectives to describe Pho but the pho I had there was tasty and delicious in a \"wow this was really, really good\" kind of way. I really liked it and thought it was priced fairly. Also the \"Regular\" was definitely enough food in my honest opinion and i was really hungry.  Service  This is probably a growing pain but as I sat there I noticed they were kinda all over the place with service for a bunch of different guests. The biggest thing I noticed were some orders were missed or not served quick enough and some people were waiting for their food. I know myself I was waiting maybe 20 minutes. I will give them a pass since a) they're new and b) it's lunch time and it was packed. If this was great this would've been a 4.5 rounded up to a 5.0  In summary, definitely try this place out if you're hungry for a good bowl of Pho with a ton of different configurations. 4.5 out of 5.0 but marking it as a 4.0 because it's not \"perfect\""}
{"text":"Nice try for the new pho place. It's surprise me. It's very clean and bright. We having the signature \" northern\" pho. The  base soup is very tasty with ginger flavour which is very unique. The other one i always order in the Vietnamese restaurant is \"bun bo hue\" also very good. We also order the chicken and pork with rice. The meats are tender and spring roll is very fresh.  I will strongly recommend this to my friend and family  in this area. I think this one is the best one in the area. Cuz I knew there is more than 3  restaurants in the same location serving the Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (5 stars) Restaurant is located in the plaza behind First Markham Place with ample parking and the interior easily seats 30-40 people. Modern furnishings, bright lights and clean tables provide a comfortable eating experience. The only complaint I have is the state of their menus, which are precariously held together by staples.    SERVICE (5 stars) Service is polite and efficient. On busy evenings, you are given a number and told to wait within the enclosure. Waiters take your orders on a tablet and refill water regularly. Eating utensils are provided at the table for your convenience.   FOOD (5 stars) We ordered the Just Pho You noodle bowls, priced at $8.75 for the regular size. You have the option of any and all toppings as well as fresh or regular noodles. I ordered the Tom Yum soup base for an extra dollar and tried all their toppings. Usually I avoid chicken as they give you dry chicken breast. I was pleasantly surprised when there were slices of tender steamed/poached(?) with skin and all in my noodles. I struggled to finish all the toppings given. Noodles arrived piping hot and cooked to just the right consistency.   VALUE (4.5) At $8.75 for a bowl of noodles, the price point is neither high nor low. I love the idea of unlimited toppings and the quality of food offered is high.   OVERALL 5 stars - I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid viet resto. It gets busy so thats a good sign. Just one small issue. I was already seated, taken off my jacket, and was looking at the menu. A staff member comes over and asked me and my girl to sit in the middle of a crowded table so that someone else can take my table. I was like ummmmmm and gave him a look. Luckily another table was cleaned up and they took that one. I dont know why he just didnt wait a minute instead of coming over and making me feel so awkward. These are the kinds of things that make lasting impressions on people. I would come back and give it one more try. 2.5 to 3 stars. ***"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this pho place regularly since it open.  The pho beef broth is tasty, and the best part is you can build your own pho bowl with either regular \"hor fun\" or fresh \"hor fun\". Also I really like pho bo hue, the soup is far the best in town.  The fish sauce chicken wings is a must order for me. I would definitely recommand to give a try on their pho as I will regularly return when I want to have pho."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness !!! I must go !!!  Let me start by describing the food. The Pho (9.00) with rare beef slices was by far the best ! The soup, noodles and beef were all on point. It's a must have.   The Wrap and Roll (19.99) was very cute and amazing. Yu make your own spring roll. You dip the rice paper in the water and place your choice of meat and veggie inside.   The A3 spring roll (6.75) we got was very similar (if not the same as the Wrap and Roll).   The only disappointment would be the rice with chicken and steak (10.50) It wasn't very authentic to me - would probably not order this again   Overall - an amazing experience would still come again for the pho and wrap and roll   Note: there's limited sitting so if your planning on coming on a weekend try to come earlier or else you'll be waiting in line."}
{"text":"After just one visit, I think this is a great Vietnamese restaurant. Service was friendly and food was great! We ordered a couple of our go to diahes which was the Vermicelli bowl (bun) with grilled chicken and beef with spring rolls and grilled pork chop and chicken on rice. We enjoyed both! Need to come back for their soup noodles (pho). There might be a wait at prime times but well worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Original beef broth and my boyfriend ordered the Satay sauce broth and both were tasty. We both ordered the customize make-your-own pho option because we can select as many meats that were on the list.  I highly recommend ordering the Large Size because the Regular/size is significantly smaller and I didn't get full from it.  Price was comparable to other Pho places in Scarborough.  Their meat was tender but I wish they gave us more meat."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a few friends hearing that they are doing a 20% off special weekend.  So I thought I should give it a try.  I ordered the beef brisket noodle with tomato soup and some appetizers such as grill beef wrapped in betel leaves, crispy chicken wings with chillies, and shrimp crackers top with grill pork.  They are very tasty, the wings might be a bit spicy for some people but I really like it.  Out of this three appetizers, the chicken wings is the best.  Back to the beef brisket noodle with tomato soup, the soup base is very favourable.  The beef brisket is very soft and portion is very generous.  I choose the rice noodle with it and I believe that's the best to go with this soup base.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better place for pho in the Markham area.   We have been coming back since its close to where we live.  I like the idea that we can make our own bowl, we can pick and choose the soup base, the toppings and either fresh or regular noodles we want in our bowl.  Their original beef broth soup base is really flavourful but not overly salty at all (unlike most of the viet place out there).  As for toppings, my favourite are the rare beef and briskets.  The rare beef are so tender and soft.  We also like to order C11 - the Bun Bo Hue (BBH), I love the level of spiciness and the rich flavour of the soup.    One thing the restaurant should really improve on is their service.  It is always difficult to get a hold of the servers and ask for the menus and teas. Also, you sure need a lot of patience for the food to come as we waited at least 15-20 mins for our food.  Overall, it is a recent place for pho in Markham when you are not in a major rush.  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"There are lots of pho restaurants opening up everywhere around the GTA. So much that the experience gets diluted sometimes. Take a bowl of Pho for example, most pho restaurants have pho that tasted so similar, I don't know if I can tell them apart in a blind test.   It gets to the point that I start judging a pho restaurant by whether or not they use MSG to flavour their soup stock. The fact is MSG taste good, any potential health concerns aside. With that being said, I am also concern with how I feel after a meal too. When I consume a massive amount of MSG, I'll get very thirsty and my lips is dried. Overall, not a pleasantly feeling.  So, does \"The Pho Restaurant\" have this \"Magical Sprinkle Goodness\"? I don't think so. Hope they keep this up, because a lot restaurants starts off with passion then loses it somewhere along the way.  The staffs are friendly, helpful, and the environment is very nice. Besides the pho, and bun no hue that we had, the appetizer spring roll and rice paper roll is terrific too. For now, if I'm in the area and want fine Vietnamese cuisine, I'll head to the \"The Pho Restaurant\".   Taste **** Price **** Portion ***"}
{"text":"Very cozy family restaurant with tasty real Vietnamese food and great service. I recommend   it."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in Markham. Portions are large and filling and I like that you can choose so many toppings for the vermicelli or the rice. Mango salad is yummy too"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Located behind FMP, I think this will be a regular visit as the pho delivered. Solid menu and fair pricing, but the service could improve. This will sit well for Vietnamese cuisine in Markham."}
{"text":"Very nice service, the food here is great.  Especially grill beef, so tender and delicious. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I found my favourite pho restaurant!!! Great food! Fresh noodle. The guy there is super nice, I like how he suggest what to order but not too aggressive. Love the ca phê dá (coffee), sweet, rich strong drop coffee with condense milk. Price is a little on the high side."}
{"text":"I think I've found my new favourite Viet restaurant in Markham!   We got: - Cha gio ($6.50): Crispy and freshly made! Filling ratio is on point - taro, meat, some veg!  - Bun bo hue ($9): One of the best ones I've had in the GTA! It's spicy, flavourful and the squeeze of line really tops it off. - Pho ($8.75 for Regular): They offer a \"build your own pho\" concept - you choose your broth (certain bases available for extra cost... basic beef broth is no extra charge!), noodle type, and meat toppings (rare beef, beef balls, brisket, flank, tripe, chicken). AND the toppings are unlimited!  - Rice w/ meat patty and chicken: It's good and pretty huge serving.   Prices are reasonable, tastes are on point... Def coming back!  FYI, they only accept cash and debit."}
{"text":"The Pho Restaurant is a clean establishment and it is definitely easy to miss when driving there since the store signage is so small.   We ordered two large Pho Tai Bac (B1 on the menu) with fresh noodles and one Cha Gio (A1 on the menu), which are basically deep fried spring rolls. Honestly, this is the best pho place in Markham that I have tried so far. The broth was okay (can be better), but the meat and the noodles were excellent. The spring rolls were also tasty. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I had ever been in GTA. It has the widest selection of authentic pho or soup noodles. The bbq rice was also very good. Recommended to anyone who's looking for authentic Vietnamese restaurant"}
{"text":"4.5  Pros: Authentic Vietnamese Cuisine Friendly service  Cons: Portions could be better  I've heard a lot about this place for a while now and finally decided to give it a try.  Came during lunch time on a Saturday.  This place is super popular.  Expect to wait up top 30 minutes for a table when it's super busy.  The place has a good amount of tables but it just sheer numbers during the busy times.  One thing to note is the owners/staff are Vietnamese.  You really can't say that about 95% of all the pho places in the city.  Nothing against the others, but I'm a fan of cuisines from other countries to be actually owned and run by people from said country.  Just makes it more authentic for me.  One thing I like about the pho here is that you choose what you want.  A lot of places usually have a bunch of pre-determined combinations from you to choose from.  I like brisket, tendon and beef balls in mine.  I have never seen a pre-determined combination like that at any pho restaurant I've been to.  It's nice to have choice in the matter.  We ordered 2 bowls of pho, spring rolls and a lemon iced tea.  The most important part of pho is the broth.  The Pho Restaurant has an amazing broth.  It comes out pretty hot as well.  That's the way all noodle soups should come out if you ask me.  I can imagine sitting down to one of these on a cold winter day and being completely warmed and satisfied by it.  The spring rolls were done really well.  The wrapper was thin and crispy, no staleness at all.  It was definitely made fresh when I ordered it.  The iced tea had a good amount of lemon flavour to it.  Everything was done very well and beyond expectation one can have for a pho establishment.  Service was very friendly throughout our visit.  The host was very nice and patient with everyone he dealt with.  I observed him with other clients as well and he was super friendly and helpful to everyone he was with.  My only gripe is the portion sizes.  They were a tad smaller then what I'm used to.  My family currently always orders 2 bowls of pho, spring rolls and a lemon tea when we go out for pho.  Most of the time the bill comes out in the mid thirties.  We were up to forty here.  Not the biggest deal as the taste more than makes up for it.  The Pho Restaurant is an excellent pho resturant.  I would totally recommend it to anybody who loves a good bowl of pho.  It's tad more pricey, but the authentic taste more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"3.5 This restaurant has very limited parking (everything seems reserved by its neighbours) and always have a line. The decor is modern and welcoming. First impression for service is absolutely horrible. I hate it when multiple servers sees you and refuse to acknowledge you. One was walking around with a dish towel not even cleaning, another just between tables also not doing anything...which is an odd sight in itself since it was busy. This inattentive service was consistent throughout the night from order taking to requests for the bill. We ordered spring rolls and pho. Pho you can pick as many toppings as you like. I went for rate beef, brisket and beef balls. The soup was light and fragrant, definitely one of the better ones in town. Toppings were fresh and delicious, but portions run quite small for the price. Their large is around a medium elsewhere and it's definitely pricier. Their spring rolls however, is just absolutely AMAZING - Very light and crispy skin with tasty meat and vermicelli fillings. This I would definitely want to come back for. I would probably come back since its moments from my home and hope to see better service next time."}
{"text":"This is such a gem in the Markham area! I am extremely excited and happy that this Vietnamese restaurant decided to open in the heart of Markham. My husband and I absolutely love and enjoy Vietnamese food, as he also grew up with homemade Viet cuisine. Everything we've ordered from their menu so far, has been super authentic. We love their app rolls, pho, bun...   Please give this place a try! You will not regret this!"}
{"text":"Just watched Thor Ragnorok at the theatres and came out feeling for some Vietnamese food (don't ask me why, I just felt for it!) and had been looking for an excuse to try this place out for a while now so today was the day.  The Pho Restaurant is a relatively new entry to the pho scene in Markham and its a great new addition.  Serving authentic Vietnamese dishes its a family run joint just behind First Markham Place.  The pho here is rich, clear and delicious.  The main stand out however was the Bun Bo Hue as like others mentioned. It was truly deep, rich and complex.  The lemongrass really stood out for me which I love!    Everything we had was really good, the food came out quickly and service was excellent and friendly.  What more can you want?  I can really see this place as our go to pho place from now on in the area.  Great job!  4/5"}
{"text":"Easily the best part about this place is the service.  On my second visit, the waiter (I wish I knew his name) was exceptional.  We came around 8:00 and it was very busy, but kept us informed of how many groups were ahead of us and when we were next.  He also made a menu recommendation based on what our group was looking for.  They do accept debit, which you'd think would be a given these days (but isn't, sadly).  I ordered a create your own with chicken, rice noodles and the chicken base.  The meat and soup base was honestly a little more bland than I would have liked.  Some form of seasoning would have made it really good.  The noodles themselves were cooked perfectly though.  We also ordered wings with no complaints - they don't skimp on the butter, that's for sure.  The restaurant itself is very clean and looks pretty new.  The menus are very warn out though (torn edges, held together with staples and tape) so if they ever consider menu changes, maybe its time for brand new menus.  My experience was mostly positive and I would consider returning."}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai is double the size of everyone else in Markham. It's crazy! It's always my husband and I's go to spot for Vietnamese food in Markham."}
{"text":"Really really flavourful broth with enough beef on top. This is literally the first time I feel full and satisfied after eating pho.   Our server was very good and attentive. It was our first time here and she took the time to explain some of the items to us.   Overall, i will definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here twice and love it! This is a new pho restaurant in the area and is always packed. The just pho you is my favourite menu item, you can pick your own broth, toppings (as many as you want), and the type of noodles. My go-to is the original beef broth with rare beef, beef tendon, and beef balls with fresh noodles. They also offer to cook the bean sprouts for you. I would recommend trying the spring rolls as well. They are crispy with lots of flavour, and not too oily.  The service here is alright and the price is reasonable. Definitely one of the best pho restaurants in Markham and I can see myself coming back."}
{"text":"This place has the best bun bo hue in the GTA!!! I came here on a whim based on the reviews and I was shopping around first markham place. I was a bit skeptical thinking this was probably a chinese owned vietnamese restaurant since its like right behind fmp. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place actually has vietnamese roots and is authentic.  I came here with my mom and granny. They got the spring rolls in vermicelli. Their spring roll vermicelli bowls are ginormous. I tried their spring rolls, they were alright, but the noodle soups are the real star of the show at this place.  I've ordered the pho tai bac and the bun bo hue and each time the bowls have come out piping hot and made to order. These are apparently one size. Don't let that fool you, may not look big, but it was suuuper filling, tons of goodies. Also, may I please say that my noodles were perfect here?! I cannot tell you how hard it is to find a vietnamese noodle soup place that doesnt screw this basic thing up. So yeah not clumped and congealed like some b grade viet restos... that like to serve food fast and blah. Prices also quite standard and affordable. I also loved that in my pho I got to choose fresh or regular noodles, my  bean sprouts fresh or cooked. These guys are all about the service! I live on the other side of town, but am willing to make a drive here because the food is that good. Just don't be like me and not check store hours and come here on a Wednesday... (since they are closed on that day of the week... :( was cheesed and had to eat next door...)   Anyway, do yourself a solid and get a bowl of the bun bo hue. It is the best thing you will taste here. It packs a whole bunch of flavour and is blended so well. This place I can confidently say is going to be my favourite place for authentic vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Overall, a decent pho joint. I had been told it's an amazing place and overall, I think it's well above average from what you'll find in the city.   From my experience however, there was too much MSG. I'm ok with certain amounts, but this gave me a reaction. Furthermore, the service wasn't the greatest, but in their defense, they also were completely packed. There was a line up so it tells you the place is good."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The broth was quite flavourful and he decor is quite peaceful and quiet. Service is quiet fast as well so you can grab a quick bite really fast. Would come back again"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place after reading reviews.  Arrived on a Monday night around 7pm.   We ordered one medium beef noodle soup with rare beef and brisket and a large satay noodle soup with brisket.  The waitress asked if we would like fresh or regular noodles. We went for the fresh. After ordering we were informed they were out of the fresh noodles :(   When the food arrived, both were medium sized :(  We also asked for fresh herbs for our pho and were told they were out. How can you have pho without fresh basil? :(   The soup bases were okay, but I've had better.   A bit disappointed given the glowing reviews. I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I could say I have tried a lot of viet restaurant in town. I would say this is the best one till now. Menu choices are simple. Meat quality is above average. Beef flank has a nice texture and flavour compare to other restaurants. The star of the meal is the broth. Strong flavour but not over powering. It is a very clean broth with different herbs and spices and you won't feel thirsty after eating. Well done."}
{"text":"There were a lot of people waiting all the time but a table for 2 people was pretty quick for us. The portion is decent and they are not stingy on the ingredients. Flavourful and yummy. A bit too oily tho."}
{"text":"OMG the fresh noodles.  This is my favourite place for pho.  Can get busy on weekends so get there early."}
{"text":"Great food to satisfy Pho craving! Took the server's suggestion for curry soup, and it was great. I was very hungry going in, but still couldn't finish their large bowl. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried the beef broth pho with unlimited toppings! It was tasty and great. It's nice to finally have another pho place in Markham!"}
{"text":"I came here by myself for a casual pho dinner while visiting Toronto for work. The venue is small and unassuming from the outside, but it's comfortable and modern on the inside. My waitress was friendly, and the food came out incredibly fast (but maybe it was just a slow evening).  Everything on the menu seems very authentic. I got the Bun Bo Hue, which was tasty and had just the right spice level. The Goi Cuon Tom Thit was a nice appetizer / side dish to provide some cold and crunchy variety vs. the hot soup.  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PAYMENT: they do not accept credit cards, and they only accept CANADIAN debit cards. My US debit card, which normally works everywhere in Canada, did not work here (I tried multiple times with multiple different US cards). I ultimately just had to pay with US cash - which the kind host was gracious enough to accept. But if you're from the states, I'd recommend bringing some Canadian cash. Prices are pretty cheap (less than 20 CAD per person after tax and tip), so you don't need a lot.  Overall, this was a nice experience for a relaxed, inexpensive meal, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent place for pho in Markham. I have tried around a handful of so and they just haven't made the cut like this place. They have excellent Pho. The service is also excellent the staff are very helpful and attentive. Definitely a must try and will love!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday and this place is packed!  Typically, that's a good sign but not today when they are short a staff which caused some issues and delays.    I was seated immediately and my orders was taken right away but my food didn't arrive until much later.  When the food finally arrived, there were no napkins and I couldn't get any of the waiter's attention, on top of that, my order was wrong. I ordered a mango salad but got a chicken salad.  30mins later, I finally got that mango salad but I already finished my entree so that was a disappointment. Taste wise, I thought it was pretty good but I didn't think the price was of a good value.  Spring roll was $6.50 and some of the appetizer cost around $12-19. This is a bit expensive for Vietnamese food.  Lastly, when I asked for the bill, I was told to go pay at the cashier and it had as a line up!!! At this point, I got tired of waiting and was quite irritated.   I do think this experience is just one off so I won't quite write off this restaurant yet."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in Markham (which is pretty hard pressed to find). Great variety of viet and Thai cuisine you don't typically have among surrounding competitors.   Pho is really good. Flavour, meat quality and portion are on point. Rice dishes are also really tasty.  We've been to this place 3x in the past two weeks."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pho and Tom Yum soup.  Spring rolls were also amazing. What I appreciated the most was How hot and fresh The food was. Staff were very friendly and the Decor of the restaurant was nice as well!  I think this is probably the best pho in Markham."}
{"text":"This place has gotten a lot of hype recently and I now understand why!!!  I got the bun bo hue in a large, for $10 and my boyfriend got  a large pho with everything in it, for $9.75.   The bun bo hue was amazing! It was very flavourful and it was actually spicy! (I love any soup base with spice and this one had a good kick to it). Probably the best bun bo hue I've had to date. The rice noodles were close to al dente, which I appreciated. Also, the portion are HUGE! I struggled to finish the large, and I have a pretty big appetite. Will definitely stick to the regular next time.  Oh! A GREAT thing about this pho place is that the soup comes STEAMING HOT! I find that with a lot of pho restaurants, the soup is usually just warm, but this place has got the soup temperature on point.  My boyfriend enjoyed his dinner too. The soup was very clear, yet tasty.   The reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars was because the service is pretty slow. Took a while to get our food and our change when we paid with cash (this place only accepts cash or debit btw).   I would recommend going early for dinner since this place does get pretty packed around 6-6:30pm. The line was almost out the door!   Overall, loved the soup and the portions were huge! Will definitely come back. :)"}
{"text":"This is the only pho place I've been to that actually puts adequate amount of meat in their soups. BBH is delicious, spring rolls are very good, mango salad is terrible and the seating host is a very nice guy. Overall, highly recommend, just stay clear of the mango salad.  PS: the place is always packed and is so tiny that whether you like it or not, you will be observed by the lineup of people waiting to get in."}
{"text":"It is great to welcome The Pho Restaurant to offer authentic Vietnamese food in Markham.  I returned a few days after my first visit; it is the proof I am a happy returned customer.   They offer very good appetizers with generous portion. They could be a meal or shared by a few people.   Rare Beef Salad - well balanced of lime juice and fish sauce while they don't over power the beef taste.   Banh Dap - 10 Shrimp crackers with fried rice noodles, grilled pork and pickled carrot. Very flavourful and delicious.   Deep fried chicken Wings with butter sauce - the skin is still crispy while the meat is juicy.   I also love their noodle soups. My favourites are  Satay rare beef noodle - the Satay broth is very flavourful and has a complexity of spices. Rare beef is good quality, very soft and tender.   Hu Tieu My Tho - the chicken broth gives a clear and simple taste. The sauce is very delicious with bouncy clear noodles   Bun Bo Hue - very most aromatic broth among the 3. I can smell the spices and aroma from far. Some people complain that is not authentic since it is missing the pig blood jelly. I also wish the pig hock has more flavours and more tender. I do enjoy the BBH very much. The meat is very tender.   Iced milk Vietnamese coffee is a solid drink. Also have the passion fruit shake which is more like a juice.   We also tried the Beef Ball Pho with Beef Broth, fresh roll with grilled pork. They are pretty standard if you want to stick with the regular items.   I will definitely go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"BOLD statement alert: I think this is the best pho restaurant Markham!   [LOCATION] - 4/5 Behind First Markham Place in the plaza with A La Kitchen. There were lots of parking spots because the plaza was pretty vacant at night.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Servers were personable and food arrived quickly.  [DÉCOR] - 5/5 Quite cold at tables near the door. If I was a hardcore Canadian, I would withstand the harsh winter breeze! But I hate the cold, so I kindly asked the server if I could move to an empty table away from the entrance. And yes, she was totally cool with it.   [FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5 Very fresh, high-quality ingredients.  [ORDER] Pho Tai Bac - $9.00: fresh noodles were al dente, rare beef was tender, and broth actually tasted like beef, without an overwhelming amount of MSG.   Bun / Vermicelli Bowl Service with 3 Toppings - $8.75: I got (1) Gilled Lemongrass Pork (2) Grilled Lemongrass Chicken and (3) Ground Beef with Betel Leaf. Vermicelli noodles were firm, lemongrass pork & chicken were seasoned very well, and ground beef with betel leaf was aromatic. After I ate this bowl, I felt kind of healthy because of all the fresh vegetables.   [OVERALL] I would certainly recommend this place to those who enjoy a hearty bowl of pho and/or a light vermicelli bowl!  Note: they only take cash & debit card."}
{"text":"A great restaurant that serves very authentic Vietnamese cuisine!  There is usually a line up here even during weeknights which already tells you that this place is the real deal!  Service is generally nice and efficient. Food arrives quick and staff are friendly!  The original beef noodle soup (pho) has a very rich broth and thinly sliced beef. This is definitely an iconic dish that determines a Vietnamese restaurant's quality. I have also tried their chicken noodle soup which is made with a very light chicken broth. The slices of chicken are very fresh and pairs very well with the non-greasy soup, perfect for a lighter meal option!  Portions seem to be smaller and prices are higher than many other Vietnamese joints, but the quality is definitely there!  The place is Vietnamese owned, making it a gem for traditional Viet cuisine! Would love to come back and try their other dishes and definitely recommend this place for anyone who is looking for some home style Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new favourite viet place!  I really like their vermicelli. I've been here twice so far and both times I've ordered it. It feels like the better bang for your buck option too because you get to choose 3 out of multiple meat options (pork, chicken, beef, spring rolls, sausage), all for the same price ($8.75)! Comes with just enough vermicelli noodles and lots of bean sprouts (you can choose to have them served cooked in the bowl instead of raw) and cucumbers. Flavours were good. I prefer the lemongrass pork meat over the beef as the beef meat was a little more tough.  Bo Kho ($9.50) This is one of their speacialty pho. It's a tomato soup base pho with Vietnamese style beef stew. The beef stew pieces were surprisingly really tender and flavourful. The first time I had it the soup was more tomato-y and stronger flavor. You have the option of choosing what time of noodles you want it served with too (egg noodle, rice noodle or even rice).   This place also offers you to make your own Pho. Pick your size, soup base, noodles and toppings.  Definitely recommend this place! But note there are always line ups.."}
{"text":"The Pho Restaurant easily meets if not exceeds the already exceptionally high bar set by the quality selection of Vietnamese restaurants available in Markham. The place is chic and exceptionally clean (as expected of a new joint I suppose). As per the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers before me, I went for the bun bo hue, which met the high expectations set by the raving reviews. It was delicious, balanced in heat, hearty, and perfect for a chilly day. The appetizers we tried were also quite good; A1, A3, and A7 (deep-fried spring rolls, rice wraps, betel leaf wraps) were tasty accompaniments to our noodles.  Special note is to be made of the service. One of my friends I came with has a peanut allergy. Following a couple exchanges with the server when we realized one of our appetizers may contain peanuts, it was quickly escalated to dealing with the owner himself, who was gracious and calm in demeanour. He thoroughly explained the predicament and showed concern that while the recipe does not call for peanuts or its derivatives, the oil in which it was fried is also used for other dishes that do contain peanuts. He further requested us to deal with him directly on our next visit to avoid cross-contamination altogether. The professionalism (thorough knowledge of his products, concern for his patrons, and deft handling of the situation) he displayed merits special praise."}
{"text":"Best time to come is 430. No lines and fast service. Gets better every time. The spring roll they actually use the rice paper. Very hard to find these days. Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"this pho place is one of the best in Markham. Wayyyyyyyy better than the pho restaurant I had near leslie and 16th (that place their service is awful)."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Food - Probably the best Viet rice dish I've had in these parts.  Pick 2 meats from chicken, pork, beef short ribs.  I chose pork and beef and was not disappointed.  Bun Bo Hue was also good and had nice flavour.  Bad: 1. Parking - Lack of parking in the plaza.  All spots are reserved for certain units and there's not enough for the restaurant.  You have to drive around the complex to find units that are not tenanted to find unreserved spots and it ends up being far from the restaurant.   Worth it? Yes! Prices are standard and flavours are great.  Restaurant is new and clean so definitely worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"Wow! Let me start that i do NOT like pho as none of them is as authentic as the ones made by my Vietnamese friends and their families. This is the only pho place that I love the pho. The service is top notch and the food are consistently good"}
{"text":"This new pho restaurant is a nice addition to the neighbourhood. The staff were very friendly and the place was bright and clean. I tried the regular beef broth noodles with all toppings and the satay beef noodle. Both were decent, but I have had better at other pho places. The opening special discount was 15%, plus you get an additional 5% off if you check in on Yelp, FB or IG. I felt that the discounts offset the smaller than average portions. I would come back to try some of the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The Pho Restaurant is one of those restaurants that I frequent often and always have a great meal!  Family owned and managed. All the items I ordered always prepared with care and love.   Bun Bo Hue Pho Tai Cari (Southern Vietnamese Yellow Curry) Pho Tai Bac (Northern Style Pho) Pho Tai Sa Te (Satay Pho) Just Pho you (Pho your way) Bun Rieu (Vietnamese Crab Noodle Soup)  Bo Nuong Cuon (Beef Summer Roll) Bo La Lop (Grilled Beef Wrapped in Betel Leaves) Nem Nuong (Grilled Pork Sausage) Bo Tai Chanh (Mango Salad with Shrimps) Canh Ga Chien Bo (Chicken Wings in Butter Sauce) Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam (Chicken Wings in Fish Sauce) Banh Cuon (Vietnamese Rice Rolls)  I am a noodle person and I tried all the above and love every single one of them. So now I always have a hard time to just pick one whenever I visit!  Their appetizers are tasty too! With so much flavours and the taste of Vietnam in every bite!  I wish all business would be like The Pho Restaurant which have spent so much time and effort making and serving delicious food from their homeland!  My 6000th review dedicated to small family business that works so hard in GTA!"}
{"text":"I recommend the vermicelli bowls! Portions are pretty big and it only costs $8.50. You get to choose your own toppings (3 choices). Price is one of the cheapest I've seen for vermicelli bowls! Especially for the size. Note that the vermicelli noodles are thick though, and not the regular thin ones that usually comes in these bowls.   I also tried the bun bo hue. Very flavourful but Beef did not seem to be the highest quality :( Still a good bowl of bun bo hue though especially since there's not many good bun bo hue options in Markham!  Ambiance is nicer and feels more high-end than other pho restaurants."}
{"text":"My favourite Pho place in Markham. Friendly stuff, awesome food. It's always packed, don't come during lunch time if you don't have the time to wait. it's definitely worth the wait if you have time. :)"}
{"text":"Been here 5 times and it is now my favourite pho place in the area. Relatively small place and gets super busy during weekend lunch hours. Really enjoy the yellow curry w/ chicken specialty soup w/ fresh noodles."}
{"text":"Came to this pho restaurant because my bf has been craving Bún bò Hu for the longest time and nowhere in Scarborough seems to make it authentic enough.  The restaurant was very clean, and we came around 3pm so it was pretty empty when we arrived. Washrooms were spacious and there was ample parking around the restaurant.   We ordered the Bún bò Hu as well as the Bún with grilled pork, ground pork with betel leaves, and the spring rolls.   My boyfriend loved the Bún bò Hu as he said it was almost as good as the restaurant in North York! He ordered the large (10$) and the broth was very flavourful and had plenty of meat. One thing he said was missing was the pork blood and the banana blossoms.   I had the Bún and it was average. The portion was on the smaller side and the noodles were different (they used the same noodles in Bún bò Hu instead of vermicelli noodles). The meat I had were pretty standard that all pho restaurants serve."}
{"text":"One of the best veggie phos I've had in a while, fried tofu, buk choy & fresh noodles and herbs! The owner knows what he is saying with his reccomendations and even came to ask us how we liked the food! The ice coffee was strong and delicious! Great customer service, delicious food and a beautiful interior!!"}
{"text":"My experience was for a Saturday night dinner.   The service this night was pretty horrible to be honest.  But im giving them a pass for several reasons  1. They just opened and they are new.  2. My father recognizes the staff/owner who use to work at Kimbo across from P-mall (usually she is quite organized) 3. They were understaff and i can see the waiter and waitress working very hard to keep up  We were seated and started off fine.  But once we sat down, The crowds started.  Took us quite a while to waive down someone to take our order.  Once the order was in, we waited quite a while and when the food came, the order was wrong.  We ordered a Large but did not get that.  But since they were so busy, and we were so hungry...  We tried several times to wave the waiter/waitress down but they were so flustered that we just decided to eat it.    When we finally were able to get the waiter, he apologized and offered to waive the dish.  However, that was not our intention so we decided to pay for it.    Nothing against the food.. Bun Bo Hue was very good.. no complaints.  But there has to be a better system for service or an extra helping hand during busy weekends.  Thats my recommendation.  I will likely return to give them another try."}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian, don't even bother coming here. They won't accommodate any dietary restrictions. Asked for a pad Thai with no fish sauce and no chicken, willing to pay the price... They said nope. We can't make it like that. Lol. Seriously? Then asked for a plain mango salad with no dressing. They said nope. Not serving you. What a joke."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place. I came here for lunch today and tried the betel leaf wrapped beef and a large pho. The former was fine (though greasy) but the latter was just awful. The pho had so much MSG in it and was so greasy it was disgusting. Even my spoon had films of grease on it after dunking it in the soup.  The other reviewers here must be fake because this place is horrible. The pho is clearly not made from a legit bone broth, probs just bouillon cubes."}
{"text":"Came here shortly after they first opened their doors.  Food is great and the staff are really friendly and attentive.  Ordered a large size pho with spring rolls to share between two of us.  Portions are relatively large so it filled us both.  Will come back to try other dishes on their menu for sure."}
{"text":"All the yes to pho and in particular to this specific one! It is located right behind FMP beside Ala Kitchen, and it is the bomb. This has become possibly my favourite pho restaurant to date. The soup here is so flavourful, but not super salty like your enemies or anything, the right amount of salt with the perfect amount of spices. My friends and I all ordered the Bun Bo Hue and needless to say, it was AMAZING! It is definitely a must try.   Due to my peanut allergy, I couldn't try the grilled beef with betel leaves because they said they fried the peanuts and then grilled the meat in the same pan they used to fry the peanuts, so I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't raved by my friends though so I guess that made me feel a little better about being left out. We also ordered a side of the grilled chicken rice wraps and dang, that was amazing. To accommodate my allergy, they served all the appetizers with fish sauce, which I actually enjoyed a lot.   I ordered a passion fruit shake with my meal and it was super tangy and nice. A little sour, but it was a good sour. My friend got the Saigon ice coffee and it came with the drip filter for you to pour over ice. He seemed to like it so good reviews there.   I would say the price of the appetizers are a little steep. The grilled chicken wraps were $6.50 for 2 pieces cut into four. Grilled meat wrapped in betel leaves were $7.50, and spring rolls 6.50.   Service was handled well, the owner personally came to us to clear up any misunderstandings about the use of peanut oil in their food and he was very calm and collected about it. I'm definitely coming back here, it's just so good!"}
{"text":"The pho is a step above the rest. 5th star for the tea though.  Went for dinner on a Saturday so it was busy. Wait wasn't bad at about 15 minutes. Service was good and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I've been told that if I want Pho, I should go to this place.  Why not?  The restaurant is named \"THE PHO\" Restaurant.  Looks like they are setting themselves up for a grand time or failure.  Lucky for them, they are pretty good.  My go to place is Little Saigon on Yonge Street.  This place is a little out of the way for me.  Oh BTW - the place is really a little out of the way.  It's actually behind the First Markham Place, not in the mall as many believe it to be.  Now...let the comparison begin.  I had my younger son with me...he is the Pho-Meister.  He ordered is standard rare beef pho and I had a satay version (me thinks).  Also order the egg roll as well.  The egg roll was very good.  The broth of my satay pho had good depth of flavour.  IMO, both of these items were equal to my go to place.  The rare beef pho was not as good.  Overall, if this place was closer to my place I would probably mark it as my go to place, however, my kid still prefers Little Saigon.  To each their own!  Cheers."}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant off highway7.  Everything is good and LEGIT. The chefs are a mom and sister duo, came from Vietnam and provide authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  My favourites are the boong bo hue, and grilled beef vermicelli.  Also they have a KILLER butter fried chicken, stir fried in salt and white pepper with chopped jalapeños.... a MUST try.  5/5."}
