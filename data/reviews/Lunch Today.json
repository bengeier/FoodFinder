{"text":"I work across the street from this place and I've eaten here possibly hundreds of times.  I have never had better bun anywhere.  I always get such a refreshing feeling from their food.  The ingredients are always crisp and fresh.  It's a family run place, and they all know me there and are very sweet people.  I would recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Wish I knew about this gem earlier. My buddy brought me over here because he knows the owners, a very sweet husband and wife duo. Note that this is HK style pho, and not \"authentic\". The food is simple, which is what I need sometimes.  The pho is hot and delicious. Tons of noodles, meat and sprouts. The homemade broth is so flavourful you don't to add any sauces. The owner told me no MSG is put in the soup, so I like to drink all of the broth. Best price in downtown core and it beats out any Vietnamese food court options in the area. Crazy busy lineups but the cook is so fast and he knows how to pump out the dishes."}
{"text":"The service is pristine and the broth is pretty good. but the Beef Satay (vs Rare beef) pho, as someone else mentioned, had the slices pretty overcooked.   Foodwise, it is exactly, A OK. I love that it comes piping hot and the broth is at least not flavorless, but it could be better. There is not a nicer set of owners in the plus fiftene though, I'll tell you that. That little lady who serves up the pho is like a ray of sunshine anytime i talk to her.  EDIT: just finished my takeout (aobut an hour after ordering it) and i've tried some of the other food but let me put it this way - do NOT order the beef satay. I have a hearty old stomach and the 'bad' beef taste/smell is starting to work a number on my nausea. I have had their sandwiches and vermicelli with no issue, but i'm surprised at hte poor quality of the beef in their beef satay pho."}
{"text":"Extreme beefy I couldn't eat it because the well done beef tasted rotten and I was burping bad beef taste and upchucking.  Too much beef flavour added to mask the bad meat."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while I was walking by.  It is conveniently located by a +15.  I had their special which was spicy wonton noodle soup for around $8.  They give you a number and you grab a table and they will bring your food and utensils to you.  Standard sriracha and hoisin sauce on the tables with small plates to mix your sauces.  Worried that the soup would be too spicy, I ordered it with less spice.  It tasted a bit like a mild version of brothy hot and sour soup.  The noodles were the rice stick variety which I liked.  The portion size was good, I don't know if they use MSG or not, but I found myself thirsty with a slight headache in the afternoon.  The wontons were bulbous, nothing amazing the filling was ok, the wrapper was ok.  Overall, an ok place to have lunch.  Nothing that's going to blow your socks off.  If you are craving pho, I would probably make reservations at TOA which is a block away.  If you want something fast, this place is fine and convenient especially during winter."}
{"text":"I've worked downtown for 6 years and I've been going there for pretty much as long. The food is delicious and everyone is very friendly.   But beware: Their soup is ALWAYS boiling hot so before you tuck into the tasty food cool it down! :)  Also, it's a great name!"}
{"text":"One of the many MANY vietnamese pho options in Calgary - you can't go wrong.  What can I say beyond the fact the pho was comforting and delicious?  It's your standard pho, flavorful and prepared with a lot of love - the sweet lady who worked the register made me feel instantly welcome.  It's fast and cheap as well - perfect for a downtown lunch, especially if you need something to warm your bones up.  I need to come back for the rare beef!"}
