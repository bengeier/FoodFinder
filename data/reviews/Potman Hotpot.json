{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed. While the food quality was decent, the service was absolutely terrible.   Our table was ignored multiple times when we attempted to call them to take our order. The male servers also did not even bother to look in the direction of our table, which was close to the door. A couple of the orders we had marked on the order sheet were not even entered to the system (as shown by the Chinese-only receipt).   Don't bother coming here if you aren't able to speak Mandarin Chinese. You'll barely be able to communicate with the male servers and you most definitely won't be able to communicate to the ladies that periodically refill the soup."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5* I liked this a lot better than AYCE. I left just as full and spent a lot less. Quality vs price was good, portions were good, variety of choice was good. I got the tomato soup base and really enjoyed it. So flavourful I didn't even feel the need for extra dipping sauce. Definitely my new go to for hot pot when I'm too lazy to prepare it at home, or don't what to deal with left over ingredients."}
{"text":"The place was nice and clean and the service was helpful. They mainly speak mandarin but can understand minimal cantonese. English is okay too. The individual pots made for an efficient meal. The meat and vegetables were fresh and cooked very well and quickly in the pot. I recommend a reservation especially on weekends because the place is busy. The ambience is very warm and the interior is nicely designed. The price was very reasonable and even better than an AYCE. The quality is outstanding and I would totally come back again."}
{"text":"There is a promotion until the end of November (November 30, 2017) that it costs $38 for two pots or two people (from Groupon) If you take a picture when you are at the restaurant and put the picture in \"moment\" of WeChat, you can get a jug of watermelon juice or plum juice for free.  Even though it's not all you can eat, it comes with slices of pork, lamb and beef. It also has seafood, like shrimps, mussels, and crab eat. You can choose your vegetables within the selection. They also have a variety of soup base, including the traditional Asian herbal soup base. I chose the herbal soup base. It's tasty, even the herbs are sweet. Everything is fresh and good. At the end, I can't finish everything on the table and I could take whatever leftover home.   I would like to come back to try another soup base."}
{"text":"Individual hotpot | Beer | Paid per dish | Not AYCE | Berkshire pork | Waygu beef | Angus beef | Seafood  Mon - Fri: 4pm - Midnight Weekends Noon - midnight  Prices range from $3 - $9/ small or large pot (soup base only) to start. Then each item and dipping sauce is extra per order (see menu attached in photo).   This hotpot is not an all you can eat hot pot restaurant.  Because it's not like your usual AYCE, you order and you forget the cost of it after a while. You'd be surprised at the total at the end. But the quality is there for their meat, seafood and other items. They do offer platters for their categories so you can try a bit of everything. They do have draft beer for $9 a jug. It's equivalent to about under 4 pints.   The meat platter came with pork, beef and lamb slices for $8/order. Their seafood platter came with shrimp, oyster, squid tentacles, surf clam, cuttle fish, mussels, squid, and imitated crab meat.   Overall I enjoyed the quality of food here. Their restaurant is clean and bright. I would come back here."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 7:30 of 5 people on a Saturday night and we didn't get seated until 8pm! We almost lost our patience and went to another restaurant as it was getting hot waiting and we do have 2 kids with us.  They were really apologetic though and they did made up for it with their customer service and complimentary drink. It was definitely a busy night but food came fast and they refilled our soup in a timely manner .  Food quality was excellent , so the price compensates for it and I love the variety. I know it's expensive , for 3 adults (plus 2 toddlers) the total came to 95 (before tip) so I find that reasonable . Of course we didn't over order food like how we would on an AYCE , but we ordered enough for dinner . I wish I can try more items but we were careful on what we ordered since it's not AYCE.  I would come back again next time if I feel like treating myself to a nice dinner where I can splurge and try other items they have on the menu especially the snacks/desserts section!    If you pay cash there's a bit of a discount but I didn't pay attention how many percent ."}
{"text":"Rating - 4.0/5.0  I'm sure most folks typically hit up all you can eat joints and as such, would try to eat as much as you eat to get your money's worth! In the end, you're left feeling super full and guilty of eating so much.  I have been on the look out for a la carte hot pot joints and came across this one right here!  The way it works here is you pay for your soup base which ranges from $3.00 to $5.00 and another $0.49 for all you can choose sauces. The rest will be pay as you go!  The advantage of a la carte is that you get to choose specific items that you want without over stuffing yourself. Also the meat choices are generally better quality. For example, these lamb slices were smooth and tender with the right amount of marbling. I also tried their premium items as the US wagyu beef and it was definitely a melt in your mouth experience!  The total bill came to approximately $30 per person after tax and tips and I left feeling absolutely satisfied.  Service was also friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Good place for hot pot . Very good service . Ppl here very nice . I recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Great hotpot place that is not AYCE. Good portion sizes for a la carte. There were 3 of us, so we each ordered different soups. The soup bases were not overly salty, some hot pot places add so much msg and salt. We ordered a meat platter, vegetable platter, some hand made meat/fish balls, and a couple appetizers. All the ingredients were fresh. The staff were quick and friendly. We thought it would be very expensive eating a la carte, but it is very affordable, way better pricing than AYCE AND you're not wasting any food. I would highly recommend this hot pot place. I've been searching for a good one in the GTA for a while, I think this is as good as it gets here!"}
{"text":"I came here based on Yelp reviews and this place did not disappoint. We ordered all of the staples of Hotpot. Everything from the Beef to veggies to the dumplings to the noodles to the fish balls to shrimp.....mmmmmm just writing this has me craving it again.  Anyways this place is a la carte style and you have to pay for everything from the sauces to the pots to the ingredients etc. but the prices are actually pretty reasonable.  I came with a big group and we all ended up paying about $45 with taxes and tips all in and we ordered almost EVERYTHING so that was not to shabby at all.  The price would have been just as much as an AYCE place.  I will definitely be coming back here for my hot pot cravings! PotMan is Top on my list for sure!"}
{"text":"So fresh so good! I must say this is one of the freshest hot pot places I been to. The ingredients are so fresh. You get what you pay for because their quality is just on top. It's not ayce but you order by plate. We split everything amongst 6 people so it worked out to about $45 each person and we got a bit of everything. I would choose the bigger pot next if you plan on have two types of broth because it just ends up overflowing when you put everything in. Service is your usual at an asian resto, most of them can't speak english properly so you have to ask them for things at least twice but you don't come here for service. Overall, it was delicious and would definitely come back again for my next hotpot craving."}
{"text":"This restaurant has only been open for 2 weeks so I was surprised by my amazing experience. Everything was perfect; they had friendly service, great atmosphere, and delicious food. I appreciated their bibs that kept my clothes clean and the long chopsticks that made getting food across the table easy.  The menu had a huge variety of food to choose from. I recommend getting the platters from each category because you get to try a bit of everything.  We got the signature spicy olive oil soup and the sweet tomato ox bone soup. You could choose the spice level of the signature soup: spicy, medium, or mild. We got spicy and it was really good. I liked the tomato soup too, it was very flavourful and unique in its own way. It even came with slices of tomato and an ox bone! Good if you're down to try something new but I did like the signature spicy soup better.  Things you gotta try from the menu:  - Konjac Silk Knot: absorbs the flavour of the soup and is perfect to dip in sesame and soy sauce mixture! - Golden Stuffed Fish Balls:  one of my favourite things from the menu. Chose it randomly but was pleasantly surprised by the crab eggs inside!  - Thailand Tiger Shrimp: they are so big and pair well with the signature spicy soup! They leave the heads on which is the best part in my opinion - Deep Fried Taro Slices: thinly sliced and already cooked so it was nice and tender.   - Deep Fried Buns: served with condensed milk which was the perfect combination to end the meal. It came with 4 buns and was also only $1.99, so cheap!  I like this hot pot place better than all you can eat places because the portions are bigger, the overall price of the meal is cheaper, and the quality of the food is better. They even have a better selection of food like wagyu beef and jumbo oysters! They also don't charge extra for holidays.  They're currently having a 20% off promotion so come quick before it's over!"}
{"text":"one of the few a la carte hotpot places in toronto. what their specialty is was apparently the premium level meats. so we came here ordering wagyu beef. the top grade one. and the berkshire pork which for those who know pork is the kobe beef of pork. we also ordered an assortment of handmade balls and veggie platter as well watermelon juice. the one thing that rubbed me the wrong way was charging for dipping sauces. even though it is 49 cents a person. it really seems cheap of a restaurant that is selling premium. sauce to hotpot is like utensils to eating. charging extra for dipping sauce in hot pot. is like charging extra for soy sauce and wasabi at a sushi restaurant. that is just stupid. outside of that. the beef was good. although not anyyhing that blows my mind. and the pork was good. but again did not blow my mind. the lamb and beef tongue we had ordered was below standards of even ayce hot pot places. which in my mind is kind of inexcusable for a place that is a la carte. quality is supposed to be above everything. my 3 star rating is pretty on the nose in that this restaurant is not one i would go out of my way to try again. or to avoid. it is meh at best. and if you want to try premium meats in hot pot sure. try this place but be prepared for it to cost you as much as a ayce place anyway it cost us about 51 dollars a person with tax and tip. and thats ordering an assortment to try everything. definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"I myself came here because of the good reviews but this place ain't for me. With all the good hot-pot joints out there that are all-u-can eat, this place isn't so I figured that they must got something special.  Ordered the spicy soup and the food came very quick so the service is good.  The food on the other hand that is not good for the food was lacking in flavor like other hot-pot places.  Beef is chewy so don't get that, the spicy beef has flavor and it was nice and tender but besides that I didn't like anything else.  Not much to say because I don't have anything nice to say.....oh and it's double the price of the other hotpot places so why would anyone go here again??  Anyways this is not for me."}
{"text":"Summary: a la carte hot pot is interesting, but not worth it for a big eater. Quality of meat redeems it slightly, but it's a heavy price tag - however, with AYCE prices steadily rising elsewhere, perhaps this will help me (and you?) control portion sizes better!  What I Liked: surprise, meat platter! What I Didn't: two soups. Sticking with one next time. What I'll Get Next: the fancy meat, to see if it's actually worth it  Solid but unspectacular place. Meat was a fair mix of fatty/lean, and that's really all I can judge: the taste largely comes from your own mixing of sauces and your soup base.  You have the option of picking just one or two soup bases. I tried two and won't be doing that next time - it tends to take longer to boil, and after a certain point the sauce you use takes over anyway (so the soup base doesn't become as distinct).  Overall, a decent option."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but quality is good and this isn't ayce. Some of their platters are not bad for value though. Highlights include two kinds of stuffed fish balls that I'd order again in a heartbeat and their fried buns with condensed milk. The first fishball was stuffed with cheese. The second was stuffed with cod roe. Both were delicious. The fried buns were super crispy and fried buns and condensed milk are a favorite of mine. At $1.99 for 4, they're also a wonderful cheap eat."}
{"text":"Yay! Finally a non-ayce hot pot place, its a-la-carte which is good for days when you don't feel like stuffing yourself. I didn't see their opening discount when I went in early November, nor did I see the groupon offer as noted by other reviewers here. Note that also no one speaks English so if you don't speak Mandarin it can be difficult to communicate or ask questions, but their menu has English.   They have a lot of larger tables for 6-8 people, so if you are a group of 2 you may need to share a table which we did but it was fine for us. For the split small pot with a choice of 2 soup bases it was $5.99. I got the spicy one and the rice wine soup, both were great .The spicy one comes with a lot of oil on top though and they were both very garlicy. I also like that they were individual mini-pots!   I got the meat platter that comes with pork, beef and lamb for $7.99 the portion was large! you could easily share this between 2 people. The meat was fresh but it didn't have a strong meat flavour and you could not tell between pork or lamb. There is also a veggie platter for $7.50 you get to pick 5 veggies or soy items and they had a lot to choose from! and I also got the fish tofu for $2.99 that came with about 9 pieces. And it is 50 cents per person for the sauces which they also had a good variety to choose from including sesame and a herb leek sauce.  This was me over-ordering and was extremely full after. It came up to $28 before tip. I could have shared the meat platter to reduce cost.   You will leave completely smelling like garlic and hot pot and will need to wash your hair and clothes after. It is a good option for a-la-carte, but if you are really really hungry ayce maybe a better deal."}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= Friendly staff, nice decor, clean.  Food ===== Fresh, seems like good quality.    VEGES:  We ordered a platter so we had some lettuce, watercress, taro, potato slices, mushrooms, frozen tofu, and Chinese cabbage.  For the price I felt like they were a little skimpy on the veges, but the veges were clean, and fresh!  MEAT: We has the regular lamb, beef and pork platter.  Meat seemed good quality and fresh.  The slices are quite thin so if you do prefer thicker slices of meat you may want to order the higher tiers.  MEATBALLS: We ordered the meatball platter, which was a little disappointing.  It literally just the meat balls you can get from T&T's hot pot section.  They have a bulk-barn style just for frozen meat balls and you scoop them up. But I want to try their Hand Made meat balls next time!  TIPS: Everything is a la carte but the sauces are charged per person.  $0.49 per person and you can order as much sauce as you want.  Would I come back? =============== Would definitely want to give it another try and try some of their premium tier meats! ^_^"}
{"text":"Best hotpot I had ever. Fresh food, and opening discounts. Had free watermelon juice too. Staffs were super friendly too. Loved this place."}
{"text":"They know their beef.   The Wagyu beef is to die for.  Literally melts in your mouth.  Everything very fresh, quantity is good, worth the price.   The only thing I'd change is to have more southeast Asian style soup base like tom yum or something.  Aaaaaaamazing."}
{"text":"I love that this isn't an AYCE- I don't feel like I have to stuff myself.  Great service for hotpot- always refills your soup and check up on you.  Fresh ingredients- the lamb is a good portion for what you pay.  The only thing that I didn't love so much were the dipping sauces, most of them were very oily.  I also love that they give bibs so that your clothes don't get splattered on!"}
{"text":"Very clean, young crowd, offers nice bibs to protect clothe from stain, excellent service"}
{"text":"Potman Hotpot features individual hot pot, too bad this place isn't an AYCE hotpot but the amount of food u order to eat will probably fill u up and pay about the same. All meat were excellent and I enjoyed it with my friends, I do recommend this place but if ur the type to eat lot nonstop then this is not for u. The restaurant is spacious so you can sit comfortably, employees were attentive with the refill of the soup as well.   Surprisingly, I enjoyed the mantao lot hahaha, the simplest food were the shining dish of the night lol. Go try it yourself and u will understand.   I'm disappointed at the sauce portion, gotta pay for it and it isn't big portion but everything else, from service to food quality, I got no complain."}
{"text":"This was our second time dining in at Potman.  Our first experience was with a group of 8 adults and 3 kids and this time around, we were just 2 adults and 1 kid.  Both times, the restaurant was chaotic and steamy neither of which I necessarily dislike as long as we're fed good food.    We went there to try their \"premium\" protein offerings the first time but I can honestly say, I couldn't really tell the difference with most of the cuts we ordered.  All the other items including noodles, variety of tofu, veggies...etc were not that different from our usual hot pot experience from other AYCE places.    I do like that they have so many different soup bases to choose from and for the sake of our 5 year old, we stuck to the plain on the one side and tomato and oxtail on the other side in a double pot.  Both soup base were really good, I particularly liked the clean tasting plain broth mixed with the tomato base oxtail soup.  I could just drink the soup and would have been a happy camper.    This time around, we just ordered from their \"regular\" protein selection of assorted meat platter, spicy frog legs, cuttlefish, frozen tofu, spinach, konjac knots and sliced white radish.  The soup pot and the meat & seafood came out promptly but then our food stopped coming.  We had to remind 3 different servers that we were still waiting on our food and they finally brought out the rest of our order.  All in all, the meal was too disconnected because of the delay in getting all our order out in a timely fashion.  Then one server started taking some of our sauces along with the empty plates while we were still eating and had food left to cook.    As much as we enjoy a good hot pot place, I think next time I'll try a different place where you don't have to fight with the bad timing and inattentive staff to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"This a la carte hotpot restaurant was the answer to the AYCE dilemma that I've encountered several times over the years.   To start off, the staff is very friendly. They come by every so often to check on you and refill your soup pot. You pay per soup pot, and while you can get a large one to share, you can also choose your own individual one, Now, don't let this deter you thinking the price will add up super fast, since the last few AYCE hotpot places charged per pot on top of their per head price. They have quite a few broths and they are all very flavourful. And even after a few refills of the broth, it still retains a very strong fragrant flavour. I recommend getting your own to try on your first visit and you can even order two different flavours for yourself!   The variety of items in the menu is very good and very well priced as well. Don't think that it's like AYCE where they give you only a few pieces of meat per plate, the portion sizes do live up to the value. The meat quality is excellent, as I have also tried their wagyu beef and it is absolutely amazing! Vegetables are fresh and well priced. They also have a good selection of dumplings, meat balls, noodles, the whole nine yards.   Calculating value and quality from the AYCE to this a la carte restaurant, I think this one is much more worth it. Even adding up the quantity of food I had cost wise, it didn't add up to what I paid for the AYCE places. So this for me is the spot to go for your hotpot needs when you don't have a friend who can eat the kitchen clean. It's great for small groups or large family gatherings, there's something for everyone. Highly recommend their fresh juices and the grass jelly dessert."}
{"text":"I have came for hotpot here on a several occasions already and love this spot! Spicy Mafia near Warden and Steeles use to be my go to a la carte/mini hotpot spot before it closed up. I had heard of this spot from a colleague and decided to try it out as the weather got colder.   The place is so spaced out where you choose to sit at a table where you share a pot or have your own mini hotpot. This place is all about freshness as the meats/seafood and veggies are all fresh and are not coming from the freezer, the variety of soups to choose from are all flavorful and I greatly love the concept of ordering a la carte as I don't like stuffing myself. They also provide large bibs to prevent soup from splattering on your clothes!   I reccomend this spot if you're going with family and friends who don't craze on over stuffing themselves as I truly find that their portion and prices are well matched. First time I came here with my dad, we ordered a meat platter, veggie platter, spicy beef, handmade shrimp meatballs, 2 vermicelli bowls, a jug of wintermelon juice and my dad got the homemade porkbone soup, while I got the satay soup. We were surprised that the bill only came to about $45 and we were stuffed! For a place that's a la carte, and has everything fresh - we found this spot to be our new go to!   The staff are super attentive in always refilling our water jug, coming around to refill our pot with soup (and the flavor is never watered down when more soup is added!), clearing off the table of any empty plates as well as checking up on how your meal is going."}
{"text":"Probably THE best hotpot place i've been to. It's NOT AYCE because all the meat and seafood they serve are top quality meat. Their specialty would probably be the beef. You have quality beef that ranges from 10-30 bucks a plate and then you have beef that's like $50 for a few slices... If you're a beef fanatic... this is the place for you buddy. you'll think the beef you eat anywhere else is crap after you have the beef here. Did I mention you get individual pots and soup bases? I personally like the individual pots cause i don't like having people sticking things i don't like into the same soup base as me..."}
{"text":"It's rare to find non all you can eat hot pot , and Potman is definitely one of the best out there.  Price is comparable, or a little higher, than the all you can eat places. Meat is definitely better, and I could taste the different. seafood also better quality and much larger in size.The rest are more or less the same. Service is great. you can the food fast and the server's always around to add soup and collect empty dishes. Get get \"groupon\" from Dealuse, which is $80 for two before tax and tip."}
{"text":"For people who are not into all you can eat hotpot, this would be the right place. But it's hard to not over order! Did not finish all the food that was ordered even though I came on an empty stomach.   The beef oil spicy hotpot base at medium spicy level was extremely spicy. This is coming from some who is addicted to spicy food.   The tomato beef bone soup base is just right. Didn't dip any of my food in sauce because it's just so awesome on its own.   At many points throughout the Sunday evening, there was more waitresses standing around than customers. Service was very quick.   Everything about this hotpot place is good. But nothing particularly stood out."}
{"text":"Saw this on IG and it looked so good we had to try it . Also checked yelp reviews and absolutely did not disappoint at all. Went on Friday night at 9 and waited for 20 minutes which gave us time to scope the menu. This was our first experience with hot pots and was very impressed. I had the pork bone broth and got beef, pork, shrimps, all the different kinds of fish balls, soft tofu, deep fried tofu, vermicelli noodle, udon and veggies. 2 sets of these. It was so delicious we had to get a refill. What I really like about it was u can get ur own pot. The service was great and friendly and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last month. We had 4 people in our party and we waited for about 30 minutes. You order on their order sheets that they have so we filled out our orders while we waited. This place is not AYCE so we had to be judicious about what we wanted. They offered a large variety of options of ingredients, soup bases, and dipping sauces/toppings. We ordered a bunch of different meats, seafood, and veggies. We each got individual pots and I had the spicy beef tallow soup base and boy was it spicy. And I'm totally fine with that but the problem was that it was also super salty, even after they diluted it with more broth. Not sure if it was an off day or if it's always like that, so if I go back I would probably go for a different soup base. All the ingredients were fresh and it turned out we ordered too much and could barely finish everything. The price was pretty reasonable for the amount of food we got. Service was fine also. A perfectly fine meal ruined by the saltiness of my soup base :("}
{"text":"My favourite hotpot restaurant right now. I've never been fan of AYCE restaurants, so this a la carte-style hotpot shop is the perfect place for me re: quantity and quality. And no time limit for dining, which is great.  I came here around 6pm on a Sunday evening. No reservation, and was quickly seated. We were a party of four.  ATMOSPHERE: One large dining room, dark interior furnishings but brightly lit and feels spacious. Very clean. Tables are tightly packed in - but side wooden tables with layered trays help to hold more food, when your table is covered with dishes and your personal hotpot.  SERVICE:  Quick and courteous. They were very well-staffed on the Sunday night. We never had to ask for anything twice, and they were regularly refilling our mini pots with soup base (which was frequent as the soup would evaporate quickly).  PRICE: Not bad! $33.18 per person after tax and tip. (No drinks) Obviously, this is a la carte, so depending on how hungry you are...  FOOD: We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of everything. We had 3 students in our party - so we were on a budget. We skipped all the special items, but opted for all the handmade options, and general platters. Note: the platters are sized for 2 people. So keep that in mind for numbers.  The handmade fish ball platter was great. As was the mushroom platter (5 types of mushrooms) and meat platter (lamb, beef, pork - in thin and rolled slices). Great for sharing and quality was good.  The seafood platter had an assortment of items, but only two of each type of food: squid tentacles, surf clam, cuttle fish, squid, mussels, imitation crab meat, and shrimp (no oyster as some previous reviews). So again, if you're a party of 3 or more, make sure you order more than 1 platter!  Highly recommend the THICK rice noodle/vermicelli - it has a great texture and soaks up all the soup.   Fried taro and the white turnip are great veggie options for soaking in your soup and eating after you've cooked a few items.  The only non-hotpot item we got was the fried man tou (buns) with condensed milk, which was very tasty. Not typically eaten with hotpot, but my friend saw it on the menu and ordered it. We're glad she did!  TIP 1: Sauces - it's 0.49 per person but it's unlimited. (The menu's not clear and it was interpreted as 0.49 for EACH sauce)  So don't be shy and ask for more.  TIP 2: Handy bibs available so you don't splash on yourself."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Not realizing this is NOT all you can eat I racked up quite a bill. Nothing really special. Next time I'm going to find a all you can eat Hotpot."}
